0,MartinHafer,What's not to like about this film?!,9,30 May 2008,"While GROUNDHOG DAY is not my favorite Bill Murray comedy, it is one of three brilliant comedies he made during the early 90s and all three are absolute must-sees. And, interestingly enough, while the film is very funny, it also has some wonderful and poignant moments--something I usually hate in comedies.The plot is pretty simple. Murray plays a jerk or a TV weather man who is sent against his will to cover the annual festivities concerning America's second favorite rodent, Punxsutawney Phil, as he tells us whether or not we'll have a long, hard winter (a very stupid tradition if you ask me). Naturally after having done this repeated times he's less than thrilled, but there's more to it than that--Murray is a nasty jerk and he delights in looking down on all the locals that take such pride in this event. Apparently, the fate is not happy with Murray, as he is oddly punished and made to repeat this same day again and again and again. Why exactly is unknown but his reactions to this exact same day are priceless--ranging from insanely funny to weird to touching.In addition to Murray's excellent performance, Andi McDowell does a good job in support and the film makers really did a wonderful job of capturing the wacky essence of small town America as well as creating a wonderful and quirky script.This film is terrific--you must see this film...now!",Groundhog Day
1,TheLittleSongbird,Delightful film with great performances and a surprisingly refreshing concept,10,2 February 2011,"Groundhog Day is a wonderful movie. Essentially it is a one-joke comedy, but what makes Groundhog Day so delightful is that whereas it could have been derivative and predictable, the film is always full of life and full to the brim with fresh ideas. The script is a delight, always funny, quotable and witty, while the story has a surprisingly refreshing concept and several great scenes.The cinematography is beautiful, and the locations and production values are consistently striking. Also Harold Ramis's direction is excellent, the pace rarely lags and all the characters are credible. The acting is wonderful too, and by far one of the best assets of this film. Bill Murray gives one of the best performances of his career, Stephen Tabolowsky gives a superb turn as the nerdy insurance salesman and the lovely Andie McDowell has never been better.In conclusion, a delightful film that works on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Groundhog Day
2,Leofwine_draca,Perfectly-judged comedy,9,9 January 2018,"GROUNDHOG DAY is a classic comedy of 1993 that goes to show that the best premises are the simple ones. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as a jerk of a local TV weatherman who finds himself forced to live the same mundane day over and over again. I was partly dreading this because of the focus on his romance with Andie MacDowell, fearing another vomit-inducing film in the style of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, but I needn't have worried. MacDowell is very good here (although the film belongs to Murray) and the romance handled sensitively. However, it's much more than just a romance. It's a film which explores the human condition and has a lesson for both Murray and the viewers in how to treat people. It's funny rather than preachy, and comes across in a very similar fashion to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE except with many more laugh-out-loud moments.",Groundhog Day
3,SnoopyStyle,Great Harold Ramis touch and Sarcastic Bill Murray,9,27 October 2013,"Sarcastic and egotistical TV weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) is forced to cover Punxsutawney Phil groundhog day for the fourth year in a row. Beautiful new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) join him. He makes fun of her cheerfulness and hates all the quaint small town happiness but he's certainly willing to hit on her.Harold Ramis has created an iconic comedic premise. It has ingratiated itself into the lexicon of society. Bill Murray is the perfect actor to portray this sarcastic character. Along the way, we have some great laughs and some well constructed sequences like Phil trying to sleep with Rita. Andie MacDowell is cute with an adorable charm. In the end, it finds a heart in this wonderfully simple premise.",Groundhog Day
4,Hitchcoc,A Soul Reclaimed,9,23 October 2001,"This movie is so charming. It starts out with Phil Connor, the Bill Murray character, doing his Bill Murray. Cynicism emanating from every pore. He is harsh, disinterested, angry, full of angst. Making jokes about everything. Everybody knows it. Everybody feels it. When the ""gift"" or ""curse"" comes to him to relive the same day over and over, he at first is confused, then flippant, then angry, then suicidal, and, finally, sees it as a chance to reclaim his humanity. This is done in a series of repetitious acts which ultimately lead to his willingness to sacrifice himself, live for the day, and try to show that he is worth saving. What this movie does, like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" is ask us what we would do, given the same circumstances. Would we fall into a retreat of depression? Would we become something that we always wanted to be? Would we keep living it the same way, hoping for he best? Murray's character wants the romance and the commitment that he was never willing to give. He toys with his own approach to the world, experimenting and doing things until he gets them right. He goes through a period of embracing the bad, lusting after Andy MacDowell, forcing himself on the other women in the town, disdaining the ""characters"" he meets. But like most ""everymen,"" he eventually must become good because without that, it doesn't matter anymore.He can only impress so much; he can only be angry so long. I find this movie so intriguing, not for what it says but for what it teaches. Some don't like the ending, but whatever the forces are that bring it about, it has to be. If we accept that premise, it's OK.",Groundhog Day
5,mark.waltz,"If I had to live my life over again, where would I like to be stuck?",8,11 May 2017,"Of course, for cynical weather man it's Punksatawnee Pennsylvania, and for him, it's a nightmare until he decides to have fun with it, taking his anger and hatred out on everyone he encounters, and that includes the groundhog. But destiny has him there for a reason, and until he figures it out, he's stuck there, reliving each day. He seduces a lonely, beautiful woman, goes on a drunken rampage and robs a bank truck. But by picking up little tidbits of people's lives here and there, he begins to see them with eyes open, eventually without the cynicism. Even behind the mask of happiness is often a tale of sadness, and each of these characters has a story worth hearing and worth empathizing with.In ""Caddyshack"", he dealt with a gopher, but an even bigger rodent is his unintentional nemesis, and like the perfect team, they've got each other, babe...over and over and over... Will his sweet assistant producer Andie McDowall fall prey to his charms during the repeated unofficial holiday, and what will it takes to wake him IP? Broadway audiences are currently storming the August Wilson Theater to see this unfold as a musical, but to many others, this is a cult film, a philosophical question of the values of life, and arguably, Bill Murray's greatest performance.For big city folk who consider the thought of spending a long time in a small town to be a reason to throw up, it might open their eyes to the ideals of a simpler, slower Norman Rockwell like life. Murray discovers what's deep inside him, finding that what he thought himself and others to be is totally incorrect. McDowall is sweet, desirable, yet no man's patsy. Most of the rest of the cast seem as if they stepped outside of small town U.S.A., although having spent the first part of my life in a small town, saw the truth that there's a variety of characters in all types of communities. So grab a ride to Puncatawnee P.A., grab a partner and clap to the Pennsylvania polka. Maybe this movie will change your life too.",Groundhog Day
6,classicsoncall,"""Will Phil come out to see his shadow?""",8,30 October 2017,"I was ready to question why this movie would have found a place in IMDb's 'Top 250', but I read a few insightful reviews offered by other viewers and their ideas made me stop and think. In particular, user 'KFL' had some really meaningful insights that I had to take into consideration and his comments changed my thinking about the picture. So thank you once again to IMDb and the thoughtful folks who share their ideas on these boards.Before that, I only saw this film as pretty much a lighthearted romantic comedy. The repetition didn't bother me because slight changes to Phil Conners' (Bill Murray) routine each day kept things moving in a spontaneous manner. The interesting thing is, Murray's character was becoming a better person day by day as he got to know the residents of Punxatawney and they got to know him. Falling in love with Rita (Andie McDowell) was the impetus needed to break the spell of the time loop and was a neat way to close out the story.And besides, any movie that includes a polka has to be a happy one. The story took place in Punxatawney, PA, so what better tune to get the town revved up than The Pennsylvania Polka!",Groundhog Day
7,lee_eisenberg,Is time on his side?,10,18 January 2006,"Bill Murray has the role of a lifetime as snide weatherman Phil Connors, going to Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the groundhog seeing/not seeing its shadow. But after bad weather forces him and his cohorts (Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott) to stay there, he wakes up the next morning and it's still Groundhog Day! And so is every day after that! To make matters crazier, he's the only one who even notices this! While most movies would probably try to use this premise as an excuse for a bunch of silly gags, ""Groundhog Day"" uses it to show how Phil changes: he starts out a sour, cynical jerk, and slowly but surely grows more human as the movie passes. That's not to say that the movie doesn't allow for some goofy scenes. Among other things, Phil memorizes every event that's going to happen every day (""I am God! I know everything that's going to happen!""), and he has a really funny encounter with the groundhog in one scene. Harold Ramis created a perfect comedy here.",Groundhog Day
8,jboothmillard,Groundhog Day,8,7 September 2005,"I might have seen this film once, but not paid full attention, and I am very glad I tried it again to understand and appreciate it, from Ghostbusters star Harold Ramis directing (Bedazzled). Basically TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the news story of Groundhog Day festivities in the town, with his producer Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott). The day seems pretty dull and ordinary for Phil, with some irritations along the way, but the next morning, the same 6:00am alarm playing Sonny and Cher's ""I Got You Babe"" repeats, as do all the events of Groundhog Day that Phil experienced. It happens again, and with all memory of his previous events, Phil is convinced he is stuck in a time loop, and for a while he takes advantage, including trying to woo Rita, which he fails at consistently. It becomes obvious he may be trapped like this, so he kills himself, but he is still alive, and tries again and again, but he still lives the same day. But with his knowledge of the same day events, Phil learns new skills and makes more friends, in order to become a saint to many people, including Rita. It is only when Rita finally agrees to stay with Phil through the night that Phil finally wakes at 6:00am to the next day, so your probably thinking that all along he was living the same day in order to be with Rita, a sweet thought. Also starring Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned, Brian Doyle-Murray as Buster, Marita Geraghty as Nancy, Angela Paton as Mrs. Lancaster, Scary Movie's Rick Ducommun as Gus and Rick Overton as Ralph. I can see how this could almost be a one joke comedy, but both the fantastic Murray and director Ramis do everything to keep you engaged. It won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film. It was number 34 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 13 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",Groundhog Day
9,ccthemovieman-1,Same Old/Same Old.....And We Love It!,9,19 March 2006,"Although I haven't watched this in awhile, I found it a very nice lighthearted romance/comedy that got better with each of the three times I viewed it. The role is perfect for Bill Murray, who is good at the playing a likable rogue, a guy always full of baloney but you don't seem to mind. The transformation of his personality is fun to watch in this film and gives it a sweet ending that was popular with audiences.You would think a movie with this plot - the same day reoccurring day after day - would grow thin in a hurry but it doesn't. The screenwriters and actors all made it clever and fun to view each ""new day."" All the characters from Murray to female lead Andie MacDowell to the supporting actors do a great job of keeping the story fresh. Particularly funny was Stephen Tobolowsky, who portrays a nerdy insurance salesman. I liked Marita Geraghty, too, and it was fun to see Rick Ducommun again, my favorite actor from ""The 'burbs."" For a modern-day comedy, the language in here is very mild. The only drawback was seeing MacDowell's character compromise her wholesome values at the end.",Groundhog Day
10,Tweekums,Bill Murray has a bad day over and over again,9,13 September 2016,"Pittsburgh Weatherman Phil Connors is not overjoyed when he is once again sent to observe the Groundhog Day festivities in the town of Punxsutawney. He goes there the day before with his producer, Rita, and cameraman Larry then heads to the bed and breakfast he is staying at. He wakes at 6am and heads to the site of the ceremony where Phil, the groundhog, is due to predict whether or not winter is over. After a half-hearted report they have something to eat before setting off home only to be forced back by a blizzard that Phil and said was certain to miss the area. Unable to continue he returns to the B&B. The next morning he gets a sense of deja vu it would appear that it is Groundhog Day again. This doesn't just happen once; for Phil Groundhog day keeps repeating although nobody else is aware of this. He soon realises that this means he can do anything he likes without consequences if he goes to jail or even dies he will still wake up at 6am on Groundhog Day. Eventually he decides to use the repeating day to better himself as he tries to woo Rita.On the face of it this is just a rom-com with a twist but thanks to Bill Murray's performance as Phil it is so much more; few actors can do cynical as well as he does. He does a fantastic job portraying Phil's reaction to what is happening; confusion, reckless elation, frustration, depression and finally acceptance and even happiness. At first it is a little hard to like his character as he uses the repeating days to learn more about Rita with the sole intention of getting her into bed that night but gradually he improves and becomes a better person a bit cliché perhaps but it was enjoyable to watch. He gets solid support from Andie MacDowell as Rita and Chris Elliott as Larry, the rest of the cast were pretty good too. There is little here to offend although some might not want younger viewers seeing his suicide attempts; particularly when he drops a toaster into his bath with no lasting consequence. Overall I heartily recommend this to anybody wanting a good comedy.",Groundhog Day
11,BA_Harrison,A film with great repeat value.,9,25 July 2020,"As I type, the past 4 months have been spent in lockdown because of coronavirus, every day seeming like groundhog day. It's thanks to this film that the phrase 'groundhog day' is even in my lexicon, having come to mean 'a situation in which a series of unwelcome or tedious events appear to be recurring in exactly the same way'.In director Harold Ramis's charming romantic comedy, Bill Murray portrays obnoxious TV weatherman Phil Connors, who, while reporting from the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, finds himself living the same day over and over again. At first he is shocked and dismayed; then he tries using the inexplicable phenomenon to his advantage, gradually learning all about his pretty producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) so that he can woo her; after repeatedly failing to score, a despondent Phil commits suicide in several different ways, but eventually learns how to be a better person and finally gets to see tomorrow, with Rita by his side.With a set-up like this, in which it is necessary for many scenes to be repeated several times, there's the very real danger that boredom will set in, so it is testament to Ramis's sharp script and the great performances from his likeable cast that this never happens. Each repetition cleverly builds on the one before, with small but brilliant changes that ensure the film stays fresh, engaging and very funny throughout. Take Phil's repeated encounter with insurance salesman Ned Ryerson, for example: each meeting begins exactly the same way, but the manner in which the weatherman reacts each time is unique, ranging from awkward, to irritated, to violent, to overly friendly, to genuinely kind (it doesn't hurt that Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned is freaking hilarious).Groundhog Day is also one of those rare movies that touches the soul as well as tickling the funny bone: Phil's transformation from intolerable cynic to much-loved member of the community could melt even the coldest of hearts, Murray putting in what has to be the best comedic performance of his career (with Ernie McCracken from Kingpin a close second).Now considered one of greatest comedies of the '90s, if not of all time, Groundhog Day is one of those films that deserves to be seen time and time again. The title might be used to describe a monotonous, unpleasant, and repetitive situation, but watching the film could never be anything less than a hugely enjoyable experience.",Groundhog Day
12,moonspinner55,Another triumph for Bill Murray...,8,1 October 2005,"Hardly profound, but likable and immensely satisfying comedy has nasty, uncouth TV weatherman forced by fate into reliving the same day, over and over again, until he becomes a better person. The film is surprisingly inventive, especially considering the story has to battle a fatigued sort of repetition. The cast is uniformly excellent, with Bill Murray giving an Oscar-worthy comedic performance (he wasn't nominated, probably because he makes pictures like this seems easy and lightweight); Andie MacDowell gives her freshest, loveliest performance as a woman Murray intends to win, if he can just modify his bad manners. Cantankerous leading characters can sometimes be a drag on the screen, even if their slow-building rehabilitation is done with a gentle touch, but here Murray and director Harold Ramis create an immensely flawed human being and make him funny and endearing. *** from ****",Groundhog Day
13,blanche-2,funny and thought-provoking,8,21 January 2014,"In films, we often see people who for one reason or another have to live their lives over, or some segment of it. In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray, who plays weatherman Phil, has to live over Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. He doesn't want to go in the first place -- it's his fourth boring trip -- but he does. Because of an impending blizzard, they get stuck there. But Phil gets really stuck. He finds he can't leave the day, the town, or the people.Every day at the same time, his alarm radio turns on and plays ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher. And it's Groundhog Day. At first Phil is furious and takes it out on his broadcast about the ceremony, angering his associates (Andie McDowell and Chris Elliot) who didn't like him much to begin with. As the day continues to repeat itself, Phil finds different ways to deal with it. He picks up a woman, proposes to her so he can have sex with her, knowing that the next day the whole experience will be wiped out for her. He sees an old friend, an insurance man, puts up with him for so long, and then punches him.Finally Phil figures out how to cope with the day, which he's resigned to re-live for the rest of his life.Very funny film with Bill Murray in top form as Phil. Murray underplays the role, which somehow makes his lines funnier, dripping as they often are with sarcasm. He's very funny, and funniest when he's pretending to be sincere.The best thing about Groundhog Day is that, like City Slickers, underneath the humor, it's quite serious. It's about how we choose to deal with the situation that we're in, what we would do if we could do a part of our life over, discovering who we are, and letting go of preconceived notions.The film reminded me of something a teacher once said. If you were in an airport and there was an announcement that you would never be able to leave, every need would be met, but you would stay in the airport forever, what would happen? The teacher pointed out that initially everybody would be trying to figure a way out. It's only when you realize that there is no way out that there would be an opportunity for something wonderful to develop in that place, among those people.Groundhog Day is a wonderful film, beautifully directed by Harold Ramis, who co-wrote the screenplay with Danny Rubin, that delivers a great message using humor. You'll probably never want to hear ""I Got You Babe"" again, though.",Groundhog Day
14,Quinoa1984,A uniquely funny fantasy/comedy,9,7 November 2000,"Harold Ramis' Groundhog's Day is not only one of his best, but also a highlight for the star Bill Murray.  The story follows a self-centered weatherman (Murray) who realizes that one day on Groundhog's Day, he has his day repeating over and over again.  A film full of laughs to the brim, even if it's sometimes light, but it is pulled through by comic veterans Murray (who gives one of his best performances) and Ramis who follows with his tradition (Animal House, Vacation, National Lampoon, SCTV, Ghostbusters, Caddyshack and Analyze This) of great comedy films.  A-",Groundhog Day
15,JohnHowardReid,What a day!,9,28 May 2015,"One of Bill Murray's best films! In fact, the whole cast is really superlative. But no matter how skillful the cast, however, you're not going to get very far if the screenplay is not absolutely first-rate – and that it is! True, I thought the script's central idea was a bit overdone in places and put too much strain on credulity (e.g. the car plunging off the cliff and bursting into flames), but more than 90% of the time, the narrative does hang together rather well, despite the script's occasional attempts to undermine credulity. Of course it's an idea that Hollywood has used before, but previous versions have not explored its implications as cleverly as this riveting scenario. It's Murray's film. In fact, he is on the screen continually from go to whoa, but he handles the role so cleverly and with such charisma that it's not until is all over that we realize how adept he has been at disguising his continual presence and allowing some of the other actors, like the gifted Andie MacDowell, a few moments center screen. Available on an excellent Columbia DVD.",Groundhog Day
16,tavm,Groundhog Day was one of Harold Ramis' best movies as director,9,3 November 2014,"So after 21 years of only hearing about this movie (though when I worked at a movie theatre at the time, I did manage to watch a few scenes here and there), I finally got to see the whole thing on Netflix disc with my mom who hadn't seen this when it was first released either. She was confused part of the time but she seemed to enjoy it while I knew about the living-the-same-day-over premise the whole time. It's funny seeing Bill Murray at first taking advantage of what he can get away with in going back to what it was before and then experiencing some depression in not going forward before redeeming himself in the process. Andie MacDowell is luminous as his eventual love interest. Chris Elliott has some moments near the end. Bill's brother Brian Doyle-Murray is appropriately boisterous as the groundhog spokesman. And Stephan Tobolowsky is a hoot as this Ned fellow Bill keeps encountering. Harold Ramis did fine as director and co-writer and he provides a nice commentary track on the DVD. Since he died earlier in the year, this review is dedicated in his memory.",Groundhog Day
17,sunwarrior13,An Entertaining Bill Murray Feature,10,19 October 2012,"Groundhog Day is a comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Ramis and Danny Rubin, based on a story by Rubin.Bill Murray plays Phil, a TV weatherman working for a local station in Pennsylvania but convinced that national news stardom is in his grasp. Phil displays a charm and wit on camera that evaporates the moment the red light goes off; he is bitter, appallingly self- centered, and treats his co-workers with contempt, especially his producer Rita,played by Andie MacDowell; and cameraman Larry,portrayed by Chris Elliot.On February 2, 1992, Phil, Rita, and Larry are sent on an assignment that Phil especially loathes: the annual Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, PA, where the citizens await the appearance of Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who will supposedly determine the length of winter by his ability to see his own shadow. Phil is eager to beat a hasty retreat, but when a freak snowstorm strands him in Punxsutawney, he wakes up the next morning with the strangest sense of déjà vu: he seems to be living the same day over again. The next morning it happens again, and then again. Soon, no matter what he does, he's stuck in February 2, 1992; not imprisonment nor attempted suicide nor kidnapping the groundhog gets him out of the loop. But the more Phil relives the same day, the more he's forced to look at other people's lives, and something unusual happens: he begins to care about others. He starts to respect people, he tries to save the life of a homeless man, and he discovers that he's falling in love with Rita and therefore wants to be someone that she could love in return.Considering that none of the characters is fresh or interesting, it's a commendable achievement that the quality of the storytelling alone keeps the movie watchable and likable.Aside from that,Ramis' direction is often too cool and restrained as he wisely avoids playing into the tale's underlying sentimentality.Overall,it is an entertaining film, but it's also one that can subtly, obliquely inspire you to get out of your rut, do the right things, and move on with your life.",Groundhog Day
18,studioAT,One to watch over and over again,10,3 November 2016,"'Groundhog Day' is right up there with the best work Bill Murray has ever done, and it's also one of the best comedies ever made too.The plot is simple, and yet complex at the same time. Bill Murray's character goes on a journey to become a better man, doing some pretty dark things along the way, and yet we as an audience go along with it and will him to do well.There are lots of lovely moments throughout, with the comedy being intertwined with drama and poignancy perfectly.I highly suggest that you watch this film, because it is one that's message stays with you long after the final credits.",Groundhog Day

20,hitchcockthelegend,Is it snowing in space?,10,28 March 2013,"There's really not a lot you can say about Groundhog Day that hasn't been said before. It's unlikely that anyone remotely interested in Bill Murray would have not seen it by now, and in all likelihood loves it because it's nailed on one of Murray's finest pictures. Of course, as is the case with comedy in general, there are those who don't like it, but in my experience it's the one comedy movie that tickles the funny bones of most the most! Some have seen it just the once and loved it but feel it is a once only movie, others such as myself return to it yearly like an old friend because it's a pick me up, a tonic for the troops, it never fails to deliver the goods.That it has struck such a chord over the years is no surprise, it's a genius premise. Grumpy misanthrope TV weather man Phil Connors (Murray) is once again sent out to Punxsutawney to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. It's a place he considers as dull on earth, the festivities pointless and beneath the broadcasting talent he feels he has. The plan is to get the broadcast done and get out of Punxsutawney as quick as possible. But a snowstorm prevents him leaving and waking up the next day he finds he is stuck in the same Groundhog Day as the day before, and soon he finds that every day is the same day.""I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster, drank piña coladas. At sunset, we made love like sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over, and over, and over...""The film then follows a trajectory that sees Connors go through a number of psychological transformations. From despair to using the situation for nefarious means, to despair again and onto using his unique situation to do good. It's material tailor made for Murray who excels with a number of running gags that get expanded upon with each day. However, the ace up Harold Ramis' (director) sleeve is that the film is more than a comedy, it is also an intelligent character study, a message movie and it also doesn't lack for dramatic purpose, often proving to be a moving experience once the tickled rib pain begins to subside. It's a picture as deep in human awareness as it is rich with comedy value.Andie MacDowell as Rita, Phil's producer and object of his lust throughout the story, proves to be surprisingly good foil for Murray's comedic ebullience. While elsewhere a number of reoccurring characters are performed memorably by the support cast (Stephen Tobolowsky and Chris Elliott standing out). Ramis keeps it brisk, never allowing the plotting to fold in on itself and the sound tracking is irritatingly catchy. But it's with the screenplay (Ramis and Danny Rubin) where ultimately Groundhog day is judged, be it the comedy or human interest, it's a zinger as written. And thankfully, with Murray at the top of his game, the brainy fun on the page is brought vividly to life on the screen. Groundhog Day, one of the finest comedies of the modern era. 10/10",Groundhog Day
21,Hey_Sweden,"Complex, endearing movie; more than just ""high concept"" comedy.",10,2 February 2012,"Only with the passage of time and an increased sense of awareness can I now see a remarkable movie like ""Groundhog Day"" for what it is. The last time I watched it, and that was some time ago, I mostly saw an engaging comedy / drama / fantasy with moments both funny and sobering. Now, I can look at it and see what a thoughtful piece of work it is. It is true that it's the kind of movie that really does benefit from repeat viewings.Bill Murray makes the most of a weighty role as Phil Connors, egocentric, wise ass weatherman who travels to the Pennsylvania community of Punsxutawney to cover its annual Groundhog Day ceremony. A blizzard confines him to the town - a blizzard he failed to predict accurately - and while there he realizes he's trapped in a time loop; Groundhog Day repeats itself over and over, to the point where Phil becomes aware of practically every event that will occur. By turns, Phil is both ecstatic - if there's no tomorrow, he doesn't have to worry about the consequences of his actions, and he engages in some great comic bits of recklessness - and despondent, when his attempts to use his knowledge for self gain go awry. Only after some efforts to come to grips with the course of events does he realize the power of any human being's thoughts and actions, as he has the ability to be there for other people and even save their lives.Murray is great, whether he's being introspective, rascally / charming, or saddened. Andie MacDowell provides an appealing love interest as Rita, the terminally chipper producer to whom he realizes he's becoming attracted. A supporting cast of familiar faces also helps: Chris Elliott as the cameraman, Stephen Tobolowsky (in his best known role) as aggressive insurance salesman Ned Ryerson, Bill's older brother Brian Doyle- Murray as ""groundhog honcho"" Buster Green, comedians Rick Ducommun and Rick Overton as scruffy locals, Robin Duke as the diner waitress, and, in his film debut, a young Michael Shannon as a guy getting married.Director / co-writer Harold Ramis, making a cameo as a local neurologist, keeps things headed in clever directions (it's a delicious bit of dark comedy when Phil tries various means of suicide in his attempts to end the cycle), always successfully alternating between the laughs and the more touching elements. In fact, ""Groundhog Day"" is simply very sweet as Phil develops more of an interest in an old homeless man's welfare and becomes increasingly attached to Rita. And George Fenton's music always hits just the right notes for any given scene.

22,Doylenf,Every day like the one before...,6,21 January 2007,"GROUNDHOG DAY is really a jigsaw puzzle of a film. Are we supposed to believe that somehow fate decrees that for punishment you must relive every day like the one before--if you are judged to be a rude enough person in need of redemption? A pretty shaky premise for any comedy/fantasy--and yet, the amazing thing about GROUNDHOG DAY is that it succeeds despite the flawed premise.There are numerous twists and turns in the plot--totally unexpected and welcome--otherwise, with the story heading in the same direction day after day, things could have become pretty monotonous. That pitfall is avoided by spicing up the story with just the little differences that make for some brilliant comic touches.BILL MURRAY is quite acceptable here as the unprincipled weather man who decides to change his ways--rather improbably, I might add--and alter the course of his life. ANDIE MacDOWELL is pleasing enough as the woman he falls in love with, although never one of my favorite actresses. And others in the cast keep the comedy on a high level throughout much of the running time.Summing up: Improbable fantasy never explains why Murray suffers this strange fate--but it maintains interest and the screenplay has enough originality to keep it fresh.",Groundhog Day

24,Bunuel1976,"GROUNDHOG DAY (Harold Ramis, 1993) ***",7,24 January 2010,"While I had always been aware of this film's considerable reputation, it took me this long to get acquainted with it; in retrospect, I feel the picture to be deserving of the epithet ""modern comedy classic"". It deals with an original – and for the genre, singular – concept: a literal case of multiple deja'-vu experiences (in all fairness, the minor sci-fi entry THE TIME TRAVELERS [1964] had already delved into the theme, though obviously lacking the skill and polish realized here). Bill Murray tackles one of his best roles, actually a variation on the actor's own characterization in the much inferior SCROOGED (1988), which I watched only last week; now he is an arrogant (can he play any other way?) Weather Man assigned to the unexciting titular event in Pennsylvania – eager to get out of there, he not only finds the passage blocked by a snowstorm but, by some unexplained quirk of nature, finds himself reliving the same day over and over again! At first, he is understandably baffled and frustrated by all of this – especially in the face of the obliviousness to his predicament shown by colleagues and townspeople alike; then, he is amused by the sheer predictability of the day's proceedings; gradually, however, he learns to take advantage of this state-of-affairs – not only involving himself in the everyday life of the town, but also striving to better himself (such as becoming an accomplishment piano-player or a hand-craft artisan seemingly in the space of single day); most of all, however, he works at cultivating a loving relationship with Andie McDowell, the producer of his TV program who, normally, cannot stand him! Apparently, Murray and director Ramis (co-stars in STRIPES [1981], another recent viewing, and the GHOSTBUSTERS films) fell out during the making of this one because they had contrasting opinions about the prevailing tone of the script: Murray wanted it to be of a more philosophical bent, while Ramis thought better of extracting the comic potential out of the central situation; in the end, I feel the film strikes a good balance between the two (with plenty of visual gags and assorted mayhem but, at the same time, having a definite bittersweet side to it – in view of the above-mentioned budding romance and also Murray's numerous failed suicides!).",Groundhog Day
25,writers_reign,Days Without End,7,13 June 2009,"I don't have the best track record when it comes to catching new releases especially if they emanate from Hollywood or England and get weighed down with hype; in some cases I succumb and catch something that is good at the moment you watch it but possibly won't stand up to repeated viewings, stuff like Lost In Translation, for example, another Bill Murray vehicle. So it's taken me something like thirteen years to get around to Groundhog Day and on balance it was worth the weight. It's a classic example of shadow over substance - in this case the shadow of the groundhog that will theoretically determine the end of winter and start of spring - one of those where the performances and feelgood factor triumph over sloppy plotting - like WHY, out of nowhere does someONE or someTHING single out Bill Murray and tap him as a modern day Flying Dutchman doomed to live the same day over and over and equally pertinent WHY is he finally released. These plot holes remain unaddressed and remain in the middle of the script waiting for the cast to fall in. Having said that the acting is great as is the feelgood factor.",Groundhog Day

28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Good, but hardly great",7,4 December 2004,"I'm not saying that this movie isn't funny... quite the contrary. But so many claim that it's great, almost a masterpiece... why? It starts out very good, with Bill Murray being his typical, sarcastic, at times deadpan self, and continue being so for a good while... but somewhere, about halfway through the movie, the films pace suddenly slows ridiculously down and we're suddenly not watching a comedy with Murray's sharp wit and excellent delivery, but rather a typical early 90's romantic comedy. Why couldn't this film break that damn barrier? Why does there always have to be romance? I know, I know, us humans have quite an insatiable lust and longing for love, but can't we think of something more original and constructive to put in movies? The film gets better a little later, with Murray doing more fun stuff again... and the plot is now turned around. The first half of the film is Murray doing what he feels like, pleasing himself, the latter half if him serving other people, pleasing others. This works well, and there are some funny moments in both parts(though there are far more in the first). But the whole romance subplot... I don't know, maybe it's because it's Andie MacDowell, the queen(well, one of them... another good example would be Julia Roberts, but she's done more versatile roles) of annoying romantic comedies. Why, oh why must there always romance in movies like this? Hell, the movie could have gotten an 8 from me, or possibly even a perfect 10, if it had kept up the great entertainment of the first half. Some of the movie also seems to drag a bit, since we're basically just watching the same thing over and over again... but with tiny alterations every once in a while. The plot is good, but the romance subplot sucks. The pacing is OK. The acting is somewhat good... but the only actor that impressed me was Bill Murray... and even he was portraying the exact same character that he always does. The characters are well-written... to a extent. The humor is good. All in all, the movie is worth watching and good, but it's by no means great. I recommend it to fans of Bill Murray and *shudder* romantic comedies. 7/10",Groundhog Day
29,view_and_review,Groundhog Day a groundbreaking movie,8,7 February 2007,"""Groundhog Day"" is a fun enjoyable movie. It is humorous, although there are not many ""ha-ha"" moments. But this was one of those rare comedies that I watched, not necessarily for the next laugh, but I watched to see how the story would unfold. I wanted to see how Phil's character (Bill Murray) would develop while being stuck on this constant loop of Groundhog Day over and over. The movie made me think, ""What would I do if I were stuck in the same situation?"" You get to see Phil mature before your eyes, if not out of desire, then out of boredom or necessity. After initially fulfilling one selfish goal after another (with women, food, and even suicide) Phil decides to submit to his kinder, gentler, unselfish side, and he begins to embrace life in the town of Punxsetawney, Pennsylvania. After learning so much about the people and about communal life in general, he learns to love more than just himself. The movie was very heart-warming and inspirational. Groundhog Day was a terrific format to convey this type of story.",Groundhog Day

Murray is perfectly cast as a misanthrope who gradually learns how to become a better man when he's forced to practice, and Andie MacDowell, who I don't particularly like (and of whom this film didn't make me a convert) is fine if bland as Murray's love interest.The film does actually make you think about what you would do with yourself if you had to repeatedly live the same day.

31,Uriah43,Reliving Deja Vu All Over Again,8,12 February 2021,"""Phil Connors"" (Bill Murray) is a television weatherman for WPBH in Pittsburgh who has an elevated opinion of himself and looks down at everyone else. Although he isn't looking forward to it he has been tasked to go to the small Pennsylvanian town of Punxsutawney to cover the annual event where a groundhog named ""Punxsutawney Phil"" (a groundhog actually named ""Scooter"") is brought out to supposedly predict whether there will be an early spring or a late winter. So after giving the afternoon forecast in which he predicts that a snowstorm will not hit the area, he leaves for Punxsutawney with his new producer ""Rita Hanson"" (Andie MacDowell) and his cameraman ""Larry"" (Chris Elliott). Naturally, being the disagreeable person that he is, it is arraigned for Phil to stay at a local bed & breakfast rather than the hotel which Rita and Larry have chosen to stay. The next morning-on Groundhog Day-Phil does his usual broadcast and eventually retires for the day. However, when he wakes up a 6:00 A.M. the next morning it's Groundhog Day once again--and everything is exactly the same. Needless to say, this disturbs him very much and after going through the motions one more time again retires for the day-only to find that when he wakes up--its Groundhog Day once again. It's then that he discovers that he has been trapped inside a time loop and there is nothing he can do to escape. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fascinating comedy which--ironically enough--never seems to get old. I especially liked the performances of both Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell who seemed tailor-made for their parts. Likewise, the scenes in which Phil attempts to seduce ""Nancy Taylor"" (Marita Geraghty) was also quite amusing as well. In any case, I found this to be a most enjoyable comedy and I have rated it accordingly.",Groundhog Day
32,HotToastyRag,An iconic masterpiece,10,23 July 2019,"I'm pretty sure everyone in America has seen Groundhog Day, and that most of America watches it every year on the holiday itself. I'm included in the latter and have seen the movie over twenty times with my family. We eat Angel food cake, stuffing it in our mouths when Bill Murray does onscreen, and we drink sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist. Even as kids, we drank bitters to pretend we could fit in with Andie MacDowell. We even have a relative who tried to calculate just how many Groundhog Days Bill lived through! Our family is hardly unique, and I'm sure millions of others enjoy the same ritual every February 2nd.Bill Murray will forever be immortalized in American cinema for his role as an unlikable, sarcastic, jaded weatherman assigned to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania with his socially awkward cameraman, Chris Elliot, and his new, optimistic producer, Andie MacDowell, to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. I love this movie, but I would love it even more had Michael Keaton accepted the role, because in scenes where the character is supposed to show growth and new kindness, Bill's not particularly convincing. He is extremely convincing during most of the movie, when he's irritable, rude, and condescending. And, since this movie is a fantasy about living the same day over and over again with no consequences, it's cathartic for the audience to watch Bill's socially inacceptable behavior. How many times have we longed to tell off an irritating salesman? Bill gets to punch Stephen Tobolowsky in the face for us!There's so much to love about this movie, full of contrasts and imagination. Sweet Andie MacDowell is contrasted by Marita Geraghty's silliness. Everyone in the town takes themselves so seriously, providing the perfect surreal surrounding for Bill Murray's distaste. On the drive over, he insults the entire town, calling the residents ""hicks"" and ""morons"", setting the stage for a truly moving transformation. In Harold Ramis's iconic, inventive classic, audiences get to reappreciate small town charm, shrug off years of indifference and assumptions, learn to believe in love, and have faith in the belief that anyone can change. No matter how awful someone is, given several hundred second chances, he can change.

How many times a scene is retold doesn't really matter, because each minor tweak in the plot makes it all the more unique.And Murray isn't only brilliant, he has a warmth and chemistry with every character he encounters in the story. But it's more heartwarming because he is so cold toward many of them before the main plot point.Its strange that we never know just how long Phil is stuck in this one day for. It could be months, weeks, years, even centuries, but the narrative is clear that its a long time, because the days go into steps.1. Denial. For the first few times he is bewildered and lost. Then he begins to take advantage of him living the same day over and over.2. Resignation. This is the part when Phil tries over and over to end it all.3. Redemption.

He soon finds himself in some kind of strange time warp. Andie MacDowell plays a new producer for the network who joins him on the trek, along with Chris Elliott as the cameraman.""Groundhog Day"" (1993) is a dramedy/fantasy with some romance about a person who has lost the joy of living and become a cranky, arrogant jerk.

Meanwhile the woodchuck is cute.Beyond MacDowell on the female front, Marita Geraghty plays a potential date for Murray's character; you might remember her from the Seinfeld episode ""The Big Salad"" as Margaret. But it's the stunning Sandy Maschmeyer as his 'French Maid' date at the theater that steals the show in a brief scene.The film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in Woodstock, Illinois, which is just northwest of Chicago, and points nearby: Algonquin (opening scene), Rockford (quarry), Waukegan and Cary (interiors).

36,Aaron1375,Murray at his best.,9,26 September 2003,"This film was a rather big movie of I think early 1993.  It was one of the best comedies of that year and won over more people on its release on video. I didn't care to see it at first, but watched it when it came on cable and it won me over too.  The story has a somewhat grumpy weatherman sent to a city to do a story on the Groundhog there and the festival surrounding it. I know the name of the city, but I am not even going to try to spell it.  He hates the idea and wants to get out of there as fast as he can. Unfortunately, a blizzard hits and he has to stay longer (a blizzard he predicted would miss the area).  So he stays the night and the next morning starts out eerily the same as the previous.  At first he thinks it is just a coincidence, but realizes soon enough that the day is repeating over again. It continually repeats throughout the movie and you get to see Murray begin to loath the town and then fall in love with it.  No real explanation is given for why the day repeats, but none is really needed and it is amusing to watch Murray go through the city knowing exactly when and where things will happen and getting to know all the people as well.  The movie takes kind of a somber twist near the end when some scenes involving a homeless man come up, but it doesn't stay somber instead going for a more positive, funny conclusion.  I love the scene with the kid in the tree.  How long he stays in the day is anyone's guess, but I figure he had to be there a good 15 years worth of days...my friend informs me it takes a while to master a piano that well.  This is a very funny and entertaining movie that is heart warming as well.  I also have to give it a chuckle cause of all the time he spent trying to pursue the one lady played by McDowell...It does take forever to win over the best gals out there doesn't it?  Chris Elliot is also in this one, but don't let that scare you off, he is actually rather good and doesn't detract from the movie at all.

No mater how many times I watch it or know the jokes ahead of time I still laugh. This film is like a old joke that never goes stale.

39,SimonJack,"One of the funniest and original ""philosophical"" comedies",10,21 March 2015,"This is one of the first movies I bought on DVD after the technology came out in 1997 in the U.S. It is an ideal movie to watch when one feels blue or down in the dumps. Its humorous script and scenes always give me many laughs. Besides the humorous situations Bill Murray's Phil gets into, this film has a distinct message. It is a morality play without being preachy. It lets us see the consequences of living a selfish hedonistic life versus a decent unselfish life. And, it's all done with great humor.The genius of Harold Ramis as a comedy writer is apparent in this film. Ramis wrote some of the funniest scripts of the last half of the 20th century (besides ""Groundhog Day"" – ""Caddyshack"" in 1980, ""Stripes"" in 1981, ""Ghostbusters"" in 1984 and others). The trivia section has an interesting item under the IMDb biography of Ramis. He and Bill Murray had a falling out over ""Groundhog Day"" that ended their collaboration on films. The item refers to an interview Ramis gave. He said the falling out was ""due to differing views on what the film should be about (Murray wanted it to be more philosophical, Ramis wanted it to be a comedy)."" That seems sad and ironic because this film turned out to be such a great philosophical comedy. I don't know if anyone else has tried to count the number of times that Phil wakes up to the same day, Feb. 2 in this film. The advantage of a DVD makes it a little easier to do that; but still, some of the repetitious scenes flash so quickly that it takes some effort, and sitting through the film a few times to try to nail down the number. My count is 39 times, with the 40th occurrence being Feb. 3. If we were to figure how much time it would take Phil to learn the things he does – French poetry, playing the piano, ice sculptor, and to do all the good deeds he does, who knows how many days that would take in reality. A big majority of the scenes are his failures that also provide much of the humor. But, toward the end of those, the sense of futility that we viewers begin to feel starts to wear on the humor. So, the filmmakers timed it perfectly and at that point Phil is inspired to turn around – by something that Rita says. Andie MacDowell plays Phil's TV producer, Rita, very well; and Chris Elliott is very good as Larry, the cameraman.Phil's repeated days probably would have totaled a year or more. The only incongruity in the logic of the plot is at the end. But, without it, the film ending wouldn't make sense. The one characteristic throughout the film up to that point is that only Phil has his days repeated. To everyone else, it's Feb. 2 for the first and only time. And, every day Phil begins with the knowledge (lessons) of the previous repeated days. The accumulation of the days and their experiences explains how Phil can progress from one day to the next when he begins to read, study, play the piano, etc. Of course, some scenes would be a little different over time – i.e., Phil being able to play the piano a little better on succeeding days with his piano teacher, played by Peggy Roeder.So, for the final February 2, all the people whom Phil has encountered on his many repeated days of Feb. 2 now know him fairly well. It's not likely that he would have been able to do all of what he did in one day, so now all the other characters also have a cumulative memory of days knowing Phil in the past. As I said, it's the only way it makes sense. I wouldn't normally dissect a film this much, but ""Groundhog Day"" is such a unique concept for a movie that it invites this sort of circumspection and analysis.Here are a few choice lines that alone give a laugh each time. Phil, ""Out in California, they'll have warm weather tomorrow gang wars and some very overpriced real estate. Up in the Pacific Northwest, as you can see, they're going to have some very tall trees.""Phil, ""Do you ever have déjà vu, Mrs. Lancaster."" Mrs. Lancaster, ""I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen.""On the phone in his room, Phil: ""Yeah, sport. I know there's a blizzard. When are the long distance lines gonna be repaired? Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today . Hello?  Hello?""Phil, ""What would you do if you were stuck in one place  and every day was exactly the same, and nothing you did mattered?"" Ralph, ""That about sums it up for me.""Gus, ""Hey, Phil. If we wanted to hit mailboxes, we could let Ralph drive.""The dinner scene with Rita is a riot when Phil asks her what she is looking for in a man. She describes admirable traits, and Phil says, ""Me  me  me."" She describes some more, and Phil answers, ""Me  me . Me."" Rita, ""He's not afraid to cry in front of me."" Phil, ""This is a man we're talking about, right?"" Rita, ""He likes animals, children, and he'll change poopy diapers."" Phil, ""Does he have to use the word, 'poopy?'"" Rita, ""Oh, and he plays an instrument, and he loves his mother."" Phil, ""I am really close on this one. Really, really close.""""Groundhog Day"" is one of the best comedies of all time.

He is ideal for the character of Phil Connors, a local-area meteorologist sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in the sleepy town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for the fourth year in a row. He loathes doing it because of the holiday's inherent silliness but goes along with it anyway in a smug fashion.The events of the day involve him waking up in his hotel-room, eating breakfast, rushing to the festivities, running into an old ""friend"" from school who now sells insurance, and then being stuck in a blizzard on the way home. The day is long and merciless and Phil can't wait to fall asleep and start February 3rd. However, when Phil wakes up, it's still February 2nd and the same events unfold as if they'd never occurred. Phil is now reliving a day that went from terrible to an inconceivable nightmare over and over again. Each day's events become inconsequential happenings, as no matter what Phil does, he'll wake up at the same time, in the same hotel-room in the same fashion to the same song on the clock-radio, as if someone pushed a reset button on everything.At first, Phil panics and worries, trying to make sense of what is happening. Nobody understands what he's going through (how can they?) and nobody seems to be in this same, alternate universe as Phil. As days turn into weeks, Phil begins having fun, causing a little bit of havoc, being sent to prison, annoying people in his life, etc. He uses it in a hedonistic way in some cases, as he waltzes down to the diner, abruptly and arbitrarily asks a girl for her personal information before returning the following day and using the newfound information to make a move on her.But after a while, the effect becomes sickening to Phil, who realizes that even committing suicide is only met with the same result of waking up in the same hotel-room. What writers Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis pull off, however, is something I would've never expected. They make it so the repetition wears on Phil but also the audience in a way that doesn't make the film boring or irritating but in a way that almost treads on empathy. It's a difficult thing to accurately summarize, but after watching the same day being relived on a consistent basis, with the scene of Phil waking up to the same annoying tune on the radio, begins to wear on us in a way that we feel as if we're stuck in this time loop as well. When Phil tries to explain his predicament to others, it's as if we're trying to explain to them what's happening in our heads (or, in some cases, maybe aloud) and can't get anyone to understand or listen to us.Rubin and Ramis put us under a spell and give us no answers, another daring move on their behalf. We're never given a justification as to how long Phil is stuck in this trance (although Ramis has informally states anywhere from ten years to 10,000 years, which, with that information, just exhausts a person by the very thought of that) or, the bigger question, why?. This is wonderful because adding an explanation could've cheapened the entire film and its boldly original story, although perhaps both writers, who seemed to be on a neverending winning streak with their material here, could've found an original way to pull it off.Furthermore, the film has an incredibly black concept for a comedy that can be so funny at times. The idea of this time loop occurring is something to tie your mind in knots, but if thought about at great length, the film is deeply haunting. Imagine one of your worst days being repeated over and over again with nothing you could do to escape it. Suicide isn't an option, staying in bed won't always work, and you can't tell anyone your problems because they simply will not make the slightest sense of them (neither can you, really). With Bill Murray at the center, the film manages to be both equal parts hilarious as well as dark and often bleak as can be.Groundhog Day is sublime black-comedy filmmaking, housing an original premise, a brilliantly written script, an engaging and simultaneously depressing Bill Murray performance, and a concept to thoroughly contemplate. Being that Rubin and Ramis take so many risks with the storytelling, the concept, and the project, and discard conventional routes of explanation and simple justification, this could effectively be called experimental comedic filmmaking.Starring: Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliot. Directed by: Harold Ramis.",Groundhog Day
43,Smells_Like_Cheese,Ever wish you could relive the best day of your life over and over again?,8,19 June 2007,"I didn't really know what to expect out of Groundhog Day, to be honest I'm not really a Bill Murray fan. Him carrying a film is not too promising to me, but I'm starting to doubt that since I've been enjoying his films more and more lately. Groundhog Day is brought up in my film books and my mom said that it was a very cute movie that I might wanna check out. When I saw the excellent rating on IMDb, I got even more excited. So I figured I would rent it and give it a shot, though I got a little scared when I read what the plot was about, it seemed a little silly, but when I watched this film this morning, it surprisingly worked! Phil is a weatherman who is sent to Pennsylvania to cover the story for groundhog day with a beautiful woman, Rita who he's had a crush on for a long time. But he's always been too cocky and self centered in her opinion. When the groundhog's shadow shows, there are going to be six more weeks of winter and Phil then experiences something strange. He is reliving February 2 over and over again, but he can remember what happened the day before, so he uses it to his advantage at first. But he starts to realize maybe he could do some good in the world before worrying about getting Rita.Groundhog Day is one of those films that is very charming and the story is really cute. I loved Phil's character, how he changed and transformed himself throughout the film. He went from being a conceited jerk to a lovable guy that wins the audience. It's cheesy, I know, but it's always a plot that wins my heart. The ending was perfect, this movie was just a lot of fun to watch and I would highly recommend it.8/10",Groundhog Day
44,MovieAddict2016,Excellent comedy that anyone can relate to.,10,12 March 2003,"Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman for a local news station. Every year he goes to Puxatawney, Pennsylvania for the Puxatawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring.Well, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.Andie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager :)--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. Only one problem. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option: Stay in Puxatawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. Again. Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja-vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday. Again. Technically.So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.Part of what makes ""Groundhog Day"" so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale ""A Christmas Story,"" which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called ""Scrooged."" Anyway. Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, ""I'm-smarter-than-you"" face. He thinks himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.Harold Ramis, director of ""Analyze This,"" star of ""Stripes,"" directed ""Groundhog Day."" Bill and he are old pals, and it sure shows. I bet they had a great time making this movie. But what is good about it is that while making a fun movie they didn't forget to come up with an interesting and audience-catching tale.Another thing that is great about ""Groundhog Day"" is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example: When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but ""Groundhog Day"" does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck, never have bought a Ferarri, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of ""Groundhog Day."" I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash - it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (although my conscience would still get in the way.) There was a little comedy with John Candy named ""Delirious."" It was about a soap opera writer getting trapped in his own world. And everything he writes on his typewriter comes true. While the movie was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control any - and every- thing, and he didn't do them. I think that's where ""Groundhog Day"" steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature - in other words, I love watching the character do something the average human would do when given the power(s). And that's exactly what Phil does in ""Groundhog Day."" And that is why, among other things, it is one of my favorites.5/5 stars",Groundhog Day
45,DKosty123,It's Ground Hog Day -Again Campers- & We Got Ya Babe,9,9 September 2006,"Harold Ramis is a genius in how he developed this comedy in and outside the box frame work which works it's way back to a happy ending. While the plot itself has to do with being stuck in time, place, & space, the development of the characters & the comic situations are classic.This film is one I usually watch every year about Groud Hog Day, & every time I watch it, I notice a subtle piece of humor I didn't notice before. This is the mark of a great film & this is one. The only way you can't like this film is if you don't like Bill Murray. If you don't, & can put that aside, you will still see the genius of the script. I think this one is without a doubt the best performance of Bill Murray's career & the film he will be remembered for. Bill becomes Phil Conner in this film. As the film develops, Phil is not only stuck in this day, but he keeps exploring himself in more & more ways, & gets a chance to get to know the entire world of Pauxatawny, PA intimately. In a way, the predictable happy ending makes sense, as it takes Phil along long time to figure out how to achieve his dream which takes on the human form of Rita.There are some minor problems in the fact that some of the characters almost seem to realize towards the end that Phil has been hanging around town too long. Ramis genius is the themes he packs in. He does the easy ones like suicide & scoring the quickie. Then he does the more subtle ones like ""no consequences"" & playing in the snow. The touch with the bum who time has come no matter what Phil does for him each day shows an interesting depth provocation for a comedy film.The real classic Americana is the choice of Sonny & Cher's ""I Got You Babe"" to wake up to every morning. In a way, Harold Ramis got all of us with this film. ""Wake up campers & put on your booties because it's cold outside."" Every day is the same, or is it? Decking the Life Insurance salesman is something I've always wanted to do. ""Tomorrow will be today again, & I can't do anything about it.""",Groundhog Day
46,Red-Barracuda,A brilliant idea for a movie - executed very well,7,4 May 2016,"Phil is a bitter, egocentric weatherman who treats his co-workers and the public in general with sarcastic contempt. He joylessly travels to the remote town of Punxsutawney to carry out an annual assignment that he particularly dislikes - the Groundhog Day. While here, he inexplicably he wakes every morning thereafter to live the same day over and over again but with the freewill to act it out newly as he sees fit. In reliving the same day he moves from exploiting his unique position in order to use people to his advantage and onto a position where he begins to care more about these people and acts like a less self-centred individual.Groundhog Day is pretty clearly a high concept movie, i.e. a film whose premise you could describe in one sentence. Consequently, high concept movies don't tend to have the best of reputations as great cinema. But, it has to be said, that Groundhog Day is a very good example of a film that makes the most of a very straightforward premise. The format is deceptively simple but it allows for a lot of scope for lots of comedy as well as some well observed pathos. Such a simple idea but such a brilliant one. But what makes it hit an even higher level is the performance of Bill Murray in the central role. This is essentially a vehicle for his brand of acerbic comedy and its hard thinking of anyone else playing his part, he is so well suited to it and so effortless at playing it. It's certainly rare for a film to remain so funny after a couple of decades and the best bits of this one are still highly amusing but it also has a good deal of wisdom too. It maybe sometimes overplays the sentimentality in its final third but it can be forgiven for this on account of the many things it gets right elsewhere.",Groundhog Day

48,OllieSuave-007,A very good comedy starring Bill Murray.,9,1 December 2013,"This is a very good comedy starring Bill Murray, where he plays a weatherman reliving his same day over and over again. The plot is intriguing, cleverly directed to mix in the the right amount of comedy and drama to deliver a very suspenseful and fast-paced movie - nothing slapstick or over-the-top.We get to see Murray's character become frustrated again and again with his reoccurring days, and see him slowly attempt to transform his personality for better or for worse from all the second chances he has been given in each new day. We kind of relate to the problems he has been experiencing, from jobs to relationships. It's exciting to see how Murray will try get himself out of this repeated day predicament. Bill Murray did a great job in his role, as did actress Andie MacDowell in her performance as Rita - a very believable portrayal.The writers also did a great job on the script, mixing in life philosophies, tastefully done humor and imagination. Overall, this is very good film for all to enjoy on a Saturday afternoon.Grade A",Groundhog Day
49,sddavis63,One Of Bill Murray's Best,8,20 August 2011,"The premise is simple, and yet intriguingly complex at the same time: a man is forced to repeat the same day over and over and over again until he learns the lessons he needs to learn and is able to escape from the cycle.The man is Bill Murray, playing Phil Connors - a Pittsburgh weatherman sent to Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania on February 2 to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in that small town. Phil is not a nice guy. He's self-centred and egotistical and selfish. He considers no one's feelings important but his own, and he hates the annual assignment in Punxsatawney. He hates the work, he hates his co-workers, he hates the place, he hates the festivities and he hates the people, and he can't wait to get out. He treats everything and everyone as obstacles in the way of him getting what he wants. But stranded by a blizzard, Phil wakes up the next day only to discover that it's not the next day. It's still February 2 - still Groundhog Day - and he has to do the same things all over. And the cycle keeps repeating - which is a wonderful analogy for his empty and shallow life.The point of the movie is how repeating the same day gradually changes Phil. At first he sees it as he sees the rest of life - as a chance to manipulate. And so he spends every day learning about people - and particularly about the attractive women in town so that - with him being able to remember and them not - he's able to get whatever he wants by learning their likes and dislikes as a result of perhaps centuries of living the same day (because we're never really told how long the cycle goes on.) Phil develops a particular interest in Rita (Andie McDowell) - his beautiful producer. At first he manipulates her as well, but eventually starts to have feelings for her, and she finally proves to be his escape from the cycle, along with an encounter Phil has with an old homeless man who dies, and whose death on February 2 - which Phil can't prevent no matter how many different ways he tries - seems to touch him very deeply.Murray did a great job in showing Phil's subtle changes in how he reacts to the situation. Cynical and selfish at first, he's in turns confused, manipulatively happy and opportunistic and then suicidally depressed until he finally realizes that he has to learn to make the best of his situation and he actually starts to value the people around him and the lives they lead. Murray partnered well with McDowell, and the movie itself raises the same questions for the viewer as Phil was being forced to live through - what would you do if you could lead the same day over? Would you fix your mistakes and become a better person or would you use the situation to your own advantage?This is very funny at times and at times it's equally very dark - and Murray does well with both. It's a thoughtful and thought-provoking movie that's fun to watch. (8/10)",Groundhog Day
50,thesar-2,What if there was no tomorrow?,10,4 February 2009,"Originally, I wrote a review of 'Groundhog Day' when I was in college, back in 1993, for 'The College Voice' at Glendale Community College in Arizona. I have yet to dig up my published review, so I am going to do this review off a recent viewing on Groundhog Day 2009. What a wonderful movie, dare I say a comedic masterpiece? (Okay, I will, and damned if I will be criticized, but it is still my opinion. Still on top-ten best comedies. So, there.) I believe I have it 5/5 stars back then, and still do. This movie still holds up extremely well, 16 years after originally released. The comedy is still dead on, the emotion and the romantic scenes are also spot on. All the lines were hilarious: ""What if there was no tomorrow? There wasn't one today!"" ""That sums it up for me"" (and does for me, too, unfortunately) and the long ""I am a god. I'm not thee God"" scene was masterful. I love how they never explain how it happens, they just allow the repeated day happen multiple times (no actual count, another great aspect) and have Bill Murray's Phil learn how to be a decent individual. Absolutely holds true, even if were made today. Only difference if it were made today: everyone would have cell phones. And even then, they would play it off as if the cell tower was damaged in the storm. Funny story: after watching the movie again on 2/2/09, I came into work on Tuesday the 3rd, and asked my boss to make sure it was 2/3 and he said it was. I was extremely happy not to have to live the extremely busy (day-after-Super Bowl, 25% work-force call in sick) Monday over and over. It would have been a nightmare.",Groundhog Day

Progressively, the nightmarish feel is replaced by a domestication of this power which Phil uses by making each day the next one's draft, avoiding the same mistakes and blunders, or taking advantages of some situations through stealing, seducing women and being totally irresponsible with no fear of long-term consequences.

It's a simple premise; a man keeps experiencing the same day over and over again until he learns to use the experience to his advantage and, as fate would have it, become a better person into the bargain. It's a morality tale that the writers Harold Ramis, who also directed, and Danny Rubin have fashioned into a sweet-natured and very funny comedy, a Rolls Royce of a vehicle for its star, the great Bill Murray.And it could so easily have gone wrong. It takes a very special lightness of touch to keep a soufflé like this from deflating. It must move us as well as make us laugh and it must do it without degenerating into the kind of schmaltz that categorizes so many American movies. Personally I think it is one of the great 'American' films, a lovingly recreated picture of small-town, homespun values.

There's a whole following surrounding this film and its Buddhistic approach to spiritualism and self-improvement, which just goes to show how much the filmmakers were able to intelligently 'milk' this 'what-if' idea for all it was worth in an incredibly artistically rich way that's as inspired as it is entertaining or hilarious.

And today,10,10 September 2017,"If you've somehow found yourself watching the 2016 version of 'Ghostbusters' you may or may not have noticed some bloke popping up in the middle of the film, only to disappear as quickly. I barely spotted him. In fact, it took me until practically the end of the movie to realise it was Bill Murray, now reduced to a cameo in the film that – arguably – made him a household name. Whatever you think about the 'Ghostbusters' remake, after the original he was riding high and one of his follow-up roles (and possibly 'best') was as Phil Conners in 'Groundhog Day.' If you haven't watched it then, by now, you've probably seen a film that's – technically – based on it. The formula is a simple, if pretty basic one: a man is literally trapped in a day. No matter what he does, where he goes or who he meets, he simply wakes up the following morning in today. Since 'Groundhog Day' I've watched this format played out in all sorts of other films or TV programmes – everything from the 'X-files' did it, to variants of the genre such as incorporating horror and sci-fi to the mix. However, no matter how fun they were, none have really come close to watching a grown man kidnap a small rodent and take it for a joy ride through a quarry pit in small-town America.Bill Murray plays a weatherman who hates his assignment covering a – in his mind- low-brown and pointless celebration in a small American town which has a tradition involving a groundhog (also called 'Phil!') supposedly predicting the weather for the next few months. Murray's done it for years and is totally sick of it, however, when the day ends, a freak snowstrom strands him not just in the town, but also in the day. What follows is quite an accurate account of what might occur should this happen. At first you have confusion and disbelief, followed by the freedom to know everything that's going to happen in the future (or at least for the next twenty-four hours) and finally depression at the realisation that you're never going to live any other life that what's on offer for this day.Rumour has it that Murray disagreed with the film-makers as to what sort of film this should be. He wanted it as a deep and emotional study of the human condition when presented with such a situation, whereas the director wanted more of a fluffy family (romantic) comedy. From what I can tell both parties seemed to get their way. Yes, this film could be classed as 'fun for all the family.' There's something for everyone to enjoy. It's great fun without ever getting too dark to be difficult to explain to younger viewers. However, it does also grant Murray his wish to a degree as, despite its absurd premise, you could argue that it plays out almost exactly how it would if a human was faced with this 'capture in time.' I watched 'Groundhog Day' when it first came out in the cinema and I'm pleased to say that it's as good today as it ever was. There are plenty of good supporting cast members, my favourite was Murray's long-suffering camera man, but this is Murray's baby. The film sits firmly on his shoulders and he carries it perfectly. Enjoy its numerous imitations, but this will always be the original and best. If only the same could be said about the 2016 'Ghostbusters!' (meow!)",Groundhog Day
55,ThomasDrufke,A Premise That Has Been Done Better In Recent Years,6,14 July 2020,"Perhaps this film gets billed too heavily as ""one of the greatest comedies & rom-coms ever"" because I neither found it to be all that funny nor charming on the romantic level either. It's not a bad film but it's certainly nowhere near Murray's best. As unfortunate as it may be, the concept of the time-loop story has been done so many times now in movies and TV shows (almost all of them better) that this film feels far inferior and dated. Fair or not, that's just the way I saw it. But it deserves credit for being one of, if not, the first film to do it. But to me it didn't hold up.6.0/10",Groundhog Day

Ironically, for a film about repeating the same, titular day ad infinitum, it's tantalizingly rewatchable. This goes beyond some fantastic wish fulfillment for power, immortality and perfection offered by the time loop. It's a romantic comedy that, among other things, explores the cinematic reflexivity of the time-travel movie while touching on grand philosophical and religious questions.""What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?""That about sums it up for the modern rom-com, a cinematic nadir, the same formula and tropes repeated over and over again. ""Groundhog Day,"" too, follows the genre closely. It's this distinctly Hollywood fiction that director Harold Ramis turned to in altering Danny Rubin's original scenario, which began in the midst of the time loop (although that's exactly what ""Palm Springs"" (2020) did, yet it, too, remains distinctly a rom-com.) Phil falls in the mythical movie notion of love at first sight seeing Rita, the producer, playing with the weather-man stage. He, as portrayed by Bill Murray, is the typical male protagonist in these things who is supposedly, initially unlovable, to the female counterpart character in the movie that is (Rita). As for movie-goers, he may be most beloved in this initial state--disarming the spectator's hesitation in accepting the illusory fluff with his funny and knowing cynicism. It becomes safe for us to suspend our disbelief without feeling like the ""hicks"" that Phil desires celebrating the February 2nd celebrations of Punxsutawney.While Murray is wonderful and perfectly cast, Andie MacDowell is also an inspired choice for the co-lead, or to put it more crassly, the prize for the male hero's successfully-completed quest. Such is the way these movies go. If he's the egotistical snob with ambitions of big-city reporting, she's the girl-next-door type, wholesome, accessible, good and pure, and all that 19th-century French poetry jazz. An important thing ""Groundhog Day,"" however, does well to avoid in the rom-com vein of ""When Harry Met Sally"" and other flicks in the Nora Ephron tradition is the friend and confidant--often a homosexual in subsequent versions--in which the romantic couple drone on and on to about their amorous foibles. Chris Elliott's Larry the cameraman is none of that--not even to the extent that Elliott served that role in ""There's Something About Mary"" (1998)--instead offering a comedic sidekick to react to and comment upon Murray's dry and caustic wit. A mediator between the protagonist and the spectator, in other words, which is especially apt given that he's the only character to control or share the perspective of the ultimate cinematic intermediary of the camera, whose view the spectator shares.We get the generic boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl. But, along the way, through the time-travel gimmick, it's realized that ""We could do whatever we want."" By adopting these genre conventions, the picture is able to exploit them for a lot more fun than usual and to explore territory far more interesting, if not profound, than the usual pathetic movie idolization of yearning for intimacy, or ""love at first sight,"" ""true love"" and grand romantic gesture nonsense.""The wretch, concentred all in self""The time loop offers quite the framework for introspection. Not only for Phil, either, but for a reflection of film itself. It's one of my favorite possibilities offered by movie time travel, to reflexively exploit the same techniques and magic that comprise filmmaking. To edit characters and settings along the space-time continuum, reshooting repeatedly the same scenes with modifications, an actor playing a character acting so as to exploit the fabrication of the time loop. ""Groundhog Day"" does this better than maybe any other time-travel movie.When Phil tries to seduce Rita, the picture continues to cut to the next day as he learns something new about her to use. He finds that she always toasts to world peace despite asking what they should drink to (I know, how obnoxious, right?), for example, so the next go around, he suggests a prayer for it. His unique position makes him the film's surrogate editor. He's also an actor (Murray) playing a character (the wretch Phil) who is acting (Phil the suitor) to bed Rita. He succeeds at this earlier by learning his lines, ""Nancy, Lincoln, Walsh."" Ever the discerning producer, though, Rita isn't so easily fooled by an inauthentic performance. Hence Phil's transformation from acting to fully inhabiting, becoming the character he, also a character in the first place, was once only trying to pretend.Phil, Rita and Larry already work in the filmmaking business, or rather the small-screen TV biz of weather reports and local events coverage for a region's evening news broadcast. Phil, in particular, is involved in the most illusory aspect of this department, of a weatherman imagining the graphics projected on the green screen he performs in front of and putting his own spin on any scientific weather predictions (he arrogantly continues to claim, evidence mounting to the contrary, that the blizzard will push off to the East and hit Altoona instead). Note, too, how the camera tracks in towards one of these TV monitors as the film cuts to the crew traveling to Punxsutawney. This is why I don't mourn in the slightest the loss of Rubin's original beginning in the midst of the time loop, which doesn't begin until Phil is in the small Pennsylvanian borough. They enter the movie, through the screen, that is the Punxsutawney set and time-loop scenario.We get this with another analogy, too, that recalls another timeful classic, ""Back to the Future"" (1985). In that Robert Zemeckis production, Marty McFly and Doc Brown enter a shared dream through separate concussions--the teen with his loud music and the mad scientist falling from his toilet. Dreams as analogy for cinema. Something similar happens to Phil on his first day in Punxsutawney. At the height of his arrogance, requesting to be patched through on a telephone line for celebrities in an emergency, he's hit by a snow shovel. Yes, the weatherman who predicted the blizzard would pass by hit with a snow shovel. The rest of the movie, one could argue, is but a fever dream brought on by his freezing in that blizzard before becoming concussed from the blow to the head. He's always waking up in bed, as if from sleep, after all. Marty and Doc, too, videotape their fantastic journey through the DeLorean--just as Phil, Rita and Larry do at Gobbler's Knob, to be infinitely replayed, the weatherman caught on camera stuck in a storm of continuous doubling.This is further reflected by his double of another weatherman performing for an audience and named Phil, the groundhog, redoubled by his own shadow. I could even go on about the literalizing of the metaphoric cinematographic death of still images doubled from living movement represented by the doubled Phils driving to their doom, but I'll only say that I don't care if car explosions are an unrealistic cliché, as it's entirely appropriate if one considers that originally film, as nitrate, was notoriously inflammable--something realized in similar reflexive constructions from ""Frankenstein"" (1931) to ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019). This is the reason to fear death even in the afterlife of cinema.""I'm a god; not the god, I don't think.""Religious scholars have had a field day and philosophy courses could be taught with ""Groundhog Day."" Mere comment on the human condition. Is it not only a film-within-a-film, but a Matrix-style simulation that Phil has been awakened to? Like Neo, he's a Christ figure--no matter how many times he dies, he will be resurrected on his path to redemption, and note that one of his suicides involves leaping crucifixion pose off a church. The film even begins and ends in the clouds, not only indicating the meteorological profession but also the heavens. Or is it Eastern-style religious reincarnation? Was that shovel to the head Karma? Is it not purgatory? Rita's Catholic, after all. But, good works matter, too. Then again, he's only a god. It's a tragicomedy of Greek proportions, of rebirth from descent to the underworld. Aristotelian poetics exemplified. Maybe a postmodern critique of a postmodern man returned to the simplicity of a Capraesque, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946), American small town--albeit one who inevitably turns to refinement in poetry, piano playing and ice sculpture. Or a Nietzschean Übermensch, of eternal return, beyond good and evil. Surely there are even psychobabble explanations, and Phil does visit a shrink.Point is there is no cosmological explanation for the time loop--at least not beyond the narratology of the hero's journey and the rom-com genre. Not even the science-y locus found in ""Palm Springs"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014) or rules of ""Back to the Future."" There's no point, no meaning, or maybe there is, but it never succumbs to base sentimentality or grandiosity. It's up to the spectator to interpret, but ""Groundhog Day"" offers a lot more to work with than one will find in one-off examples of the genres and conventions it incorporates, exploits and subverts. The groundhog and his shadow only forecast the length of winter if you believe it to be so--and even then not really. It's this multifold ambiguity and complexity shadowing the familiarly comedic and romantic that's timeless.",Groundhog Day
57,g-bodyl,The Defining Film of Bill Murray's Career!,10,29 September 2014,"As a movie buff, I cannot believe that I have not seen Groundhog Day until now and I wonder what put me off from seeing this movie for so long, especially as a big Bill Murray fan. This film uses his comedic talent to a long extent, but also this is a showcase for his dramatic talent too. This film has a rather interesting concept in reliving a day every day for what seems to be forever. This film is somewhat predictable, but it has a sweet, undeniable message about love and life.Harold Ramis, who also co-wrote this film, directs a film about a grumpy TV anchor named Phil Connors who has to go to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the events along with his lovely producer and his wise-cracking camera-man. But after a big blizzard strikes the area, Phil is stuck in a time loop and he must relive the day over and over and over again.This is one of the best films of Bill Murray's career. He was excellent in such films like Ghostbusters and Lost in Translation, but his role here is even better. Even though he is like Scrooge in the film, he still managed to be hilarious. He gave his character an edge where we can like him despite his rudeness. Andie Macdowell also does a really good job as Rita, Phil's producer.Overall, Groundhog Day is a magical film that has an original sci-fi concept, but manages to effectively work comedy and romance to that concept. While it seems complicated, it's actually a simple story. We just have to thank the screenplay that Harold Ramis co-wrote for that. I don't normally give perfect scores to comedies so that proves how great this film really is. A magical, funny adventure about love. I rate this film 10/10.",Groundhog Day

It is a really unique comedy film, there really isn't anything else quite like it, the concept was really interesting, seeing a man repeat the same day over and over again, and it is thoroughly entertaining. Bill Murray delivers a terrific performance, he has a lot of very funny parts, but he also gets to show a more dramatic side, something the world had seen little of from Murray at this stage in his career, particularly his scenes with Andie MacDowell are very well acted and their chemistry together was superb. Funny and very sweet, I would recommend Groundhog Day to anyone looking for a good comedy.

61,inkblot11,"Oh, the lessons we can learn from a GROUNDHOG!",9,4 February 2018,"Phil (Bill Murray) is a weatherman in Pittsburgh who has been sent four years in a row to cover the event known as Groundhog's Day in Puxatawney Penn. To say the least, Phil is VERY UNHAPPY and his giant ego makes him approach the project with scorn. True, this year he has a new producer, the very beautiful Rita (Andie McDowell), but even she doesn't lift the burden of boredom off his shoulders. While the rest of the crew makes due in a local hotel, Phil actually gets digs in a lovely bed and breakfast. In any case, Phil does his duty, very begrudgingly, putting up with the constant music of the Pennsylvania Polka and the ceremony of the ""little rat"". Then, a blizzard arrives. Everyone is stuck and Phil is unhappy. But, there's more. The next morning, Phil awakes to the same song as the day before, Sonny and Cher's I've Got You Babe, and finds he has to live the whole Groundhog Day experience AGAIN, even though everyone else is in happy oblivion that this is anything but the day itself. This means more polka, more little rat, more pushy insurance man trying to sell him a policy since he and Phil ""went to school together"", more plain coffee at the B and B. Making it through the second reliving, Phil wakes to a THIRD GROUNDHOG DAY, again. And again and again. Will Phil come to realize that HE HAS BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE to become a better man and win the girl of his dreams? This very funny film has the greatest idea at its base. If you were given the chance to relive a fateful day, would you change your behavior for the good? In Phil's case, it takes more than one day, of course. As the into-himself-weatherman, Murray is priceless and the cast surrounding him is wonderful, too. Add on the great scenery, costumes, timeless script and sure direction and you have a movie experience that will never grow old, even with repeated viewings!",Groundhog Day
62,Bored_Dragon,More than just a comedy,9,11 July 2019,"The cult film by Harold Ramis tells the story about a TV reporter who relives the same day over and over again for years, until true love breaks this endless loop. At first glance, this is just another romantic comedy, that will relax, endear you and make you laugh, but with every new watching, more and more I realize the multilayeredness and depth of its story. ""Groundhog Day"" is a philosophical study of human nature and life, subtly packaged in the form of excellent comedy, with a rarely well-written script, which has picked up a bunch of awards and nominations. It's a shame that it's not even nominated for an Oscar. I rarely watch movies more than once or twice, but this one I have seen at least ten times and I will re-watch it at least as many times.9/10",Groundhog Day
63,atlasmb,A Truly Great Romantic Comedy,10,3 February 2016,"One of the great films, ""Groundhog Day"" is a satisfying romantic comedy that also works as an exploration of existential and philosophical concepts.Phil (Bill Murray) is a Pittsburgh weatherman who must cover the Groundhog Day festivities for the fourth year in a row. He reluctantly travels to Puxatawney, PA with cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) to record the antics of Puxatawney Phil. After they get there, he is caught in a time loop, making him relive February 2nd over and over.Before he goes to Puxatawney, Phil is tired of his boring life. To him, it feels like everyday is the same--more clouds, more precipitation, more cold fronts. He is abrasively sarcastic and genuinely depressed.When he is forced to live a life where literally everyday is essentially the same, he learns to appreciate the small things. And he realizes that he is the primary variable in his own life; it is up to him to appreciate the little things and to make the most of his time.The script is terrific. Not only does it hold together on scrutiny, it is touching and funny. Bill Murray straddles the line between humorous and meanness perfectly, affecting a transformation that is believable. Andie MacDowell does a good job portraying a woman who is essentially romantic and optimistic, but wary of Phil's intentions. Chris Elliott is self-deprecating and perfectly tuned to his role as an immature schlub.I know I am not alone in saying I have watched ""Groundhog Day"" so many times I have lost count. Its appeal is so great, it easily bears rewatching, like ""The Wizard of Oz"". In my estimation, Bill Murray has two of the top comedies of our time with ""Groundhog Day"" and ""What About Bob?""",Groundhog Day
64,ironhorse_iv,Groundhog Day is worth repeat viewings. It's just that watchable!,8,2 February 2017,"Seeing how today is Feb 2, a.k.a. the actual in-real-life Groundhog Day holiday. It's the right time to watch this science fiction comedy, written by Danny Rubin and directed by Harold Ramis. After all, this movie has one of the most fascinating, existentialist premise, ever given for a film; in which, asked, 'What would you do if you were stuck, reliving one day, for the rest of your existence""? This is what happens to cranky, yet smarmy, Pittsburgh weather forecaster Phil Connors (Bill Murray), whom awakened, everyday knowing that he has lived the same day, millions of times. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while 'Groundhog Day' isn't the first movie to use the time loop trope, as that would be 1945's British horror movie, 'Dead of the Night', it did massively popularized the time loop trope to the point, that other films like 2011's 'Source Code' & 2014's 'Edge of Tomorrow', were greenlit to bring their own spin to the genre. However, none of those films were comedies. So, in the end, ""Groundhog Day' is in a league of its own. It's uniquely funny, well-written and with Bill Murray at his deadpan best. You really get to see Phil's character arch at work, here as he tries to both adjust to and escape from his bizarre dilemma. I like how the movie works from irresponsible, self-centered hedonism to suicidal despair to an insane number of time-consuming distractions, to finally, finding his own unexpected potential for self-growth and redemption, leading to a possibility arises that tomorrow might come for Phil after all. Bill Murray was amazing in the way, he was able to show, all of those range of emotions. Even the supporting cast was, fun to be, with. Andie MacDowell was great as the kind-hearted TV producer, Rita Hanson, while Chris Elliot was hilarious, as the cameraman, Larry. While, Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned Ryerson was a bit annoying and hammy. He was alright for the short period of time, his character was used. It's was also nice to see future-famous actor, Michael Shannon in one of first films. Not only was the acting, great; but director Harold Ramis also uses sound and music to great comic effect. One of those was the ironically cheery Sonny and Cher song 'I Got You, Babe', which will clearly get stuck in your head, for better or for worse. Another great thing, Ramis and his crew did well, was use repetition to great effect. In a lesson trained, director, this movie could had easily to be boring, but somehow his crew, were able to make, seeing repetitive scenes, seem worthy rewatchable. They did this, by adding so much detail in the background, while also giving us, something new to look at, while using the same footage, by introducing sub-characters and key items, slowly. Another great thing, they added, was a lot of scenes that foreshadows, future events, yet also leave much to the viewer's interpretation, since many of the visuals can be used as a metaphors such as ice sculptures. One such example is the use of the blue opening where Phil describe his ideal home. While, it looks like vast emptiness, if you look deeply into it, the weather scene really does describe, what Phil wants, from life, as it secretly shows his selfishness and lack of concern for others, while also casting a shadow on him, both physically and mentally. In many ways, the main character is no different than the groundhog in a Plato's 'allegory of cave', kinda of a way. Another thing, worth noting is the use of author Joyce Kilmer's 'tree', poem for its use of personification and anthropomorphic imagery. At first, Phil believes that he is the center of the universe, only to find out after Phil reads this work, that he isn't, and only by better himself and others, can he be happy with his existence. I also glad the movie cut certain scenes, such as the reasons, why the time loop started, as it was originally plan to be started with an ex-girlfriend of Phil's putting a voodoo curse on him in order to get revenge. In my opinion, it could had ruin the film purpose. It's better to leave the reasons, why the time loop, unsolved. In many ways, these examples are why people see the movie as a spiritual transcendence 'Carpe Diem' type of a movie. It's really hard to find any faults of this film's message, because of that. However, after this movie release, several writers emerged, claiming that the story was stolen from their idea such as science fiction authors, Richard Lupoff and Ken Grimwood. In truth, the inspiration for this film was the 1892 story ""Christmas Every Day"" by William Dean Howells, along with 1905 novel ""The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin"" by P.D. Ouspensky. Overall: I have to say, this is a great movie, even if certain scenes were a bit unpleasant and somewhat disturbing. I can also overlook a few goofs in the time versions where certain people and events shouldn't had happen, but did, because how well-written, well-acted, and very positive and moving, the rest of the movie, was. Because of this, the film is considered a modern classic. It's just sad that, during filming, Ramis and Murray's longtime collaboration and friendship ended abruptly, without public explanation, due to Murray undergoing a divorce at the time of filming. At least, it's good to say, they reconciliation, before Ramis death in 2014. In the end, I'm glad, they did, because along with 1984's 'Ghostbusters', this movie is one of the best works, they ever did well with each other. So, thank you, Harold Ramis and Bill Murray for all the laughs. You two, really do deserve the praise on how good this movie was.",Groundhog Day
65,The-Sarkologist,When you are trapped in one day and cannot escape.,7,15 July 2012,"This is a strange movie because there are some existentialist elements to it, some elements of Carpe Diem, and some elements of the inability of humanity to control his or her environment. I have never seen a movie with this sort of plot before and as such I consider it to be incredibly unique and as such worth watching and considering, if only for a unique plot. Not only is the plot unique, but the main character, Phil (Bill Murry) grows and develops through the film as he tries to come to terms with what is happening to him.Phil is a weather man in a small television station in Pittsburg. He wants something better but all he is doing now is going up to a town which is the home of Groundhog Day, the day when Phil the Groundhog comes out of his home and if he sees his shadow then there will be six more weeks of winter. He hates the town and the day, even though festivities go on all night and all day, all he wants to do is get back to the city and hopefully move up in the world. He cannot get back though as a blizzard has moved in. He returns, goes to sleep and wakes up 6:00 Groundhog Day, and the day repeats itself, and continues to do so. There is no explanation as to why this happens, but one can assume that it is his rather self-serving attitude. He wants to get out of the town, but the town won't let him go.The existentialist element comes up as he is drinking at the bowling alley with some of the town drunks. He says to them, ""what would you do if everyday seems to be the same."" This is literal where Phil is concerned, but the others see this as life. Groundhog Day is just a break in the monotony of everyday life. Get up, go to work, go home, go to sleep. Nothing changes. When he realises this he basically runs amok. To the guys he is with, this is serious, but Phil is testing the water, and sure enough, when he wakes up the day has started again, and nothing has leaked over from the previous day.At first this is fun, as he takes advantage of all the knowledge that he can accumulate and use against people, but he soon comes to realise how powerless he is where no matter what he does, he just simply cannot get his producer (Addie McDowel) to sleep with him. He knows everything about her, but the way he is, the sleaze, he simply cannot get what he wants from her. The Carpe Diem aspects come along here where he sees that he can seize the day, and he certainly does because he knows everything that happens, and by the end of the film, he can prevent almost all of the disasters from happening (almost all as he is powerless to prevent the death of the town drunk).As he goes through this one day, he soon comes to see how powerless he is. This is seen with his inability to get his producer to bed, and moreso, his inability to die. He tries everything but he always wakes up in the morning. Not only that, he cannot stop an old man from dying. He can save a kid, he can save a man from choking, and he can get a hesitant fiancée to marry her fiancé, but he cannot stop a man from dying of old age. No matter the advantage of knowing everything about everybody and everything that is going to happen in this one day, he is still human and he is powerless to stop death.This is the most humbling aspect of Phil, for he tries everything, but he always finds that by the end of the day this man is dead. He cannot stop it. He calls himself a god, but he knows that he is really a man.How does he get out of it? Well the movie does not really explain how. You know when, and I will not reveal that, but there is no reason why. There is no reason why it starts and no reason why it ends. What does happen is that he starts off as a slime, and ends as the most loving and caring man that anybody could know. The question is, what happens to him when he wakes up the next day? Now that he is out, how long does it take for him to return to his former self. One can see glimpses of his former self beginning to shine through that next day. One thing about Phil, is that he is only human.",Groundhog Day

70,zkonedog,"Iconic Film, Though Perhaps Doesn't Try As Hard As It Should",8,5 February 2017,"There is no doubt that ""Groundhog Day"" is an iconic film based on the concept alone. It can also be hilariously funny, a tribute to Bill Murray's deadpan style of humor. It has almost become as iconic on the holiday it depicts as the little rodent itself! All of that being said, ""Groundhog Day"" also strikes me as a movie that, if it would have tried just a bit harder, could have been an all-time classic, overtaking the cult/niche status it currently owns.For a basic plot summary, ""Groundhog Day"" tells the story of Phil (Murray), a dissatisfied TV weather man in his fourth year of covering ""that giant overgrown squirrel"" in Punxsutawney. He goes through the motions, then gets stuck in the quaint PA town due to a horrendous blizzard. The next morning, he wakes up to the same song (""I Got You Babe"") playing on the radioand discovers that it is the same day: February 2nd. Phil quickly discovers that he is trapped in a time loop of sorts, where the calendar resets to Feb. 2 at 6:00 AM each morning. At first, Phil is despondent about this life development on the day he so loathes, but as enough Feb 2's pile up he begins to realize the power that one person can have when given an unlimited quantity of time.At its heart, ""Groundhog Day"" is a comedy and features some of the most hilarious moments every put to screen, including-Phil's multiple reporting (with him becoming more exasperated and finally inspired) on the groundhog emerging from the burrow. -Stealing money from the bank truck by predicting a series of coordinated events. -Ned (Stephen Tobolowsky), that annoying former HS graduate of Phil's who eventually gets his comeuppance.It helps that Murray is cast perfectly, as his deadpan expression and style of humor are spot-on for having him move from unlike-able to a somewhat sympathetic character by the end. There is even an attempt (yes, I say attemptsee below) at a romance with fellow news person Rita (Andie MacDowell) that tries to provide the emotional backbone of the film.Here's the rub, though: ""Groundhog Day"" will never make it onto my ""all-time classic"" film list. I can watch it every few years, but that is about it. The reason? It's a film that seems to coast by on the high concept and Murray's popularity at the time. It's like the filmmakers said ""we know we have a winner here"" and as such didn't put the ""finishing touches"" on the product. Some of the things that bug me about the film include:-The romance is so unrealistic that it is tough to get swept up in. Phil & Rita loathe each other at the beginning of each day, yet we are supposed to believe they can fall madly in love by the end of any given day. I realize that Phil's ability to show compassion is a key plot point, but I always found it a bit absurd that it could be towards/with Rita. -Do we ever actually figure out why Phil becomes stuck in the loop? I realize that isn't the point of the story, but it would have been nice to clarify what is happening. -This is going to sound like an oxymoron, but the middle gets a bit repetitive. I enjoyed ""fearful Phil"" when he is beginning to realize what is happening as well as ""confident Phil"" when he gets a handle on his surroundings, but the middle section dragged a bit in showing the same events perhaps a bit too much. I read that the original script had the viewer plopped into the middle of the sequence (instead of telling it chronologically), and I think I would have liked that better.Overall, ""Groundhog Day"" is a solid, funny film that has come to personify the holiday it associates itself with (no small task in its own right).

I have no doubt of that. The film portrays the journey of a television meteorologist to a small American town to cover the Groundhog Day ceremony (a ceremony that exists in real life) on 2 February. It turns out that this meteorologist is a detestable person with a bad and smug personality. Maybe because of this, he ends up getting stuck in time, reliving countless times the same day until he corrects his own mistakes.The film is not clear on the reasons why the main character gets stuck in time. Simply inexplicable, this phenomenon happened and allows the character to do the stupidest things knowing in advance that he will live everything the next day, so there are no consequences. Generally, I do not like movies where strange phenomena occur without the film explaining to the audience the reason behind it, and I may even consider it as a point against the film, but in this case I am willing to make an exception. In fact, this film is so funny and enjoyable that we do not care about the logical reasons behind the story. The movie works just as well: strange, illogical and funny. That is enough.Murray is the right man for the main character. He is the actor who always seems impassive and serious, even when around him the most stupid things unfold, as if all that were normal. And that makes the performance of this actor even funnier and appropriate for the character. Beside you, a capable cast of support allows you even more room to shine.I will not consider this movie to be brilliant. It was not even thought to be. It's funny, it entertains well the audience and makes laugh without exaggeration. This makes it enjoyable, and a good bet for anyone who simply wants to spend quality time.",Groundhog Day
72,leplatypus,An eternal movie.... (DVD),10,19 July 2006,"I thought at first that it was only a concept movie: a ""what-if"" story; an unbelievable story in reality but a very funny & rich one in the philosophical reflexion, like only arts can offer. Another example of this free creativity would be for me ""Back to the future""... You can't go back in your past, but your imagination does! Here's the bottled-up feeling of eternity is excellently considered: the assets (you have time to learn, you know everything & every one...) and the pitfalls (a final boredom, the sadness of losing people without preventing it,...)Then, I realised that this movie is closer to every one's life than many others.... The revelation occurred while the chat between Bill Murray & 2 buddies at the bar:""What would you do if you were stuck in one place, every day was exactly the same, nothing you did mattered ?""""That about sums it up for me;""It's my life: I always complain about today is like yesterday & as tomorrow! Getting up tired, taking crowded subways, managing different kind of people with a perverse boss, back to the home to eat nearly the eternal same supper, complicated relationship..... Well, same day over, over & over....That's me, maybe you, and you or you..... This movie appeals to every one: Fantastic! And it offers in addition a solution: being socially generous.... Smile, help as much as you can & you will have the payback: your life will improve!!!! Zen, philosophy, psychology, religion says the same thing but in hundred years, thousand pages of writing..... Here's what a 2 hours movie can do!!!But that's not all: all this would have been impossible without this superb duo of Bill Murray & Andie MacDowell: I am a fan of both and they excel in this movie: I think they never have been closer than their true self: Murray has really two faces: the cynic & the kind... MacDowell: well, she smiles, she laughs, she plays, she is kind, romantic, honorable, trustful... the perfect soulmate for every one...And the final touch: the Director: Harold Ramis.. I was a fan of National lampoon, Ghostbusters and with his DVD commentary, I discover a great man: sympathetic, spiritual. He shares his enthusiasm with success and gives great insights for his movie (the symbolic & funny thanks of all the town as his motivation to direct...)So, if you have infinite time, enjoy this one as much..

This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time.The movie is a comedy starring Bill Murray and directed and written by Harold Ramis. It is one of the best movies of all time in my book, on multiple levels. It has comedy, romance, drama and philosophical crossing story arcs. The movie really makes one think about what would happen if you had to live the same day over and over again. What would you do? What would you learn from it?Bill Murray is supposed by a great cast, with Andie MacDowell and other supporting cast members who have worked with Murray before, most noted Brian Doyle Murray. The setting is simple and doesn't change much, but the repetitive process of having to relive the same day over and over again is kept interesting.A fantastic movie. Period.",Groundhog Day
74,SAMTHEBESTEST,A nice comedy but Time Loop could have been used logically and intellectually.,6,30 September 2020,"Groundhog Day (1993) :
Brief Review -A nice comedy but Time Loop could have been used logically and intellectually. A well known 90s film is entitled to deliver something upfront, at least that's what i believe, and that's how Groundhog Day comes in my watchlist. If not for that reason i would have never watched it and saved that time to watch any full proofed classic film. Groundhog Day comes with an impressive storyline of Time Loop which might have been fascinating in early 90s especially when the narrative and character aren't cold, suspenseful but are instead happy faces bringing laughters. But does that storyline make it extraordinary? The answer is no. I tell you why. The first big reason is, Groundhog Day failed to mix up fiction and real life theories, 2nd it failed to generate something important and intellectual, 3rd is it failed to show some logic. Why did it happen or how did it suddenly stop? Nobody knows the answer and they didn't even try to give an answer. Did they use Time Loop to discover philosophy of Life? Why, big No. This was an opportunity to deliver something socially responsible sort of thing but in Groundhog Day the protagonist was more focused about his own Love and lust interests. This theme of getting chance to relive the same day again and again deserved better writting where you could put joy, happiness and awareness etc and you get chance to change things according to consequences but there was nothing sort of that in the film. Bill Murray was charming and funny as always, Andie MacDowell looked somehow beautiful in some scenes and Chris Elliot did better than expected. Harol Ramis's filmography doesn't point towards any Cult Classic so all you expect from his film is one time popcorn flick in which Groundhog Day fits by all means. Any given day I would watch it just to pass the time but never as a Classic. Good but Overrated!RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",Groundhog Day

76,funkyfry,"Great comedy, one of Murray's best",8,25 February 2005,"I just watched the film again after not having seen it since I saw it in the theater. I enjoyed it much more at the age of 29 than I did at the age of 17! At that younger age, the romance in this movie seemed too cheesy for me to take, but I can now see the movie as a decent romance, but mostly just a great comedy. It's sort of an existential comedy, it really puts its character in the place of having to question the value of his life. Since he can't even make the choice to end his life, in a way he's stuck in ""the Myth of Sysyphus"" and can't rise above it until he stops fighting it and lets other people affect him. It reminds me of the more recent film ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" in this way.Murray's character is excellently realized... the other characters are good but they come off more as sounding boards for his character, including McDowell. I enjoyed the way the film was paced, it seemed to know perfectly how and what to show the audience. Don't know what else to say about it, it's a solid film, probably Murray's best straight-up comedy.",Groundhog Day

79,Vartiainen,"Within every man there's goodness, given enough time",8,5 September 2015,"One of the most well-known Bill Murray films, a movie that defined a whole subgenre of time travel fiction – the so called ""Groundhog Day Loop"" – while also being a sweet love story in its own right. Nowadays it's a loved classic, and for a good reason. Its premise is really rather simple, a man is forced to live out the exact day over and over again, but the film makers explore its possibilities to their fullest, giving us a tale about the meaning of human interaction, loneliness and the depths we can either sink or rise when there's no one to witness us.This is Bill Murray's film, through and through. His performance was the one that would either make or break the film, and he pulls it off magnificently. He gives us everything. The initial confusion, the horror of realization, the rage against the heavens, the joy of possibilities, the descend into monotony, the despair that comes with time, the strength to still move forwards. All this given with just the right amount of snark to keep the tone comedic, while also selling the depth of the story. I've never seen him show us more range and scale than in this movie.Andie MacDowell also shines as the female lead, and the various other actors give us a nice setting in the sleepy town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. I don't think this film would have worked as well as it does now if the setting had been a larger city. Now you get to know the locale, the various inhabitants, which makes the humour and drama that much more poignant.Groundhog Day is a fantastic film. Its premise and idea are pure fantasy comedy, but it rounds it up with heavy doses of emotion and drama, while still keeping it lighthearted enough to entertain. And it's those few darker moments that make the overall film shine all that much brighter.",Groundhog Day

It's funny, it's inventive and imaginative, the acting work is great and the casting choices were the best it could've ever been. I think this movie is just fantastic. Even though, when you watch it now, it's very outdated, it still will bring laughter into your home. I've seen it so many times, too many times in fact, and I never get sick of it. This movie is about a weather man who is sent to do a story on the forecasting groundhog, on Groundhog Day. This is his fourth time doing the same story, so as you can imagine, he's not thrilled or making a huge effort. When he wakes up the next day, he realizes that it's Groundhog Day again. And this happens again, and again, and again. Over and over, repeating the same day. At first he's very upset and does what ever he can to undo what ever is making it happen, but then he comes to embrace the repeated day and use it to his advantage, doing productive things. He learns how to play the piano brilliantly, which I really enjoy. The piano teacher's face when he's come in for a beginners lesson and can already play is amazingly, is just so funny. He accepts the fact that he'll repeat the day, everyday for the rest of his life, but one morning he wakes up, and it's a new day. And by the way, the groundhog is so adorable. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.",Groundhog Day

I am still of the opinion, although Murray's role in this movie is more significant - more than in his other movie where he stars excellently - ""Lost in Translation"". However, at times, windings of the plot are difficult to monitor and there are not too many scenes you can really laugh - and they are all related to Murray's lines. The best scene is where Murray is driving mad the car with two local rednecks and gives his views on life and future. The romantic angle with MacDowell is similar to most of movies with Meg Ryan.

Bill Murray plays a generally bitter, unpleasant weatherman who turns on the charm while the cameras roll but tumbles backward into mean, icy sarcasm just as soon as he's out of the frame. Forced to relive the same day on an endless loop, a much-loathed Groundhog's Day on-location report, he slowly works through his issues, loses the chip on his shoulder, finds personal fulfillment and learns how to share a meaningful moment. It's a simple idea, thoughtfully explored, that doesn't run short on heart, ideas or surprises.Murray is perfect in the role, able to convincingly evolve from contemptible jerk to charismatic goofball, but it's the in-between steps that really make his journey remarkable. His growth doesn't come without pains and struggles, missteps and setbacks, and we share his agony over those tough lessons and bitter disappointments. By the time his sentence in that circular purgatory is at an end, he's hit rock bottom, explored his darkest impulses, reached out for salvation, failed, improved and found peace within himself.Andie MacDowell is adorable as Murray's co-star, the ever-optimistic, spritely target of our affections, while director Harold Ramis gives the whole package a warm, friendly sensibility that keeps things on the up-and-up and still allows some wickedly dark material to sneak through.

88,estebangonzalez10,A spiritual and philosophical film that also happens to be quite entertaining.,9,16 April 2014,"""What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?"" ""That about sums it up for me.""There are films that don't necessarily need inventive and artistic camera shots, or groundbreaking special effects, or even gorgeous cinematography to be considered masterpieces. Sometimes a film like Groundhog Day comes along with a smart and charming story with performances and characters that are so well developed that it automatically connects with audiences by reaching for the heart, and turning it into an instant classic. With a premise that might seem boring due to the fact that the lead character has to repeat and live the same day over and over again in a small Pennsylvania town, director Harold Ramis manages to catch our attention by creating interesting characters and through a witty script he introduces important themes such as existentialism in a rather refreshing and light way. It is a very spiritual film without ever feeling religious. In a way the story reminded me of Dickens' A Christmas Story where you have an egocentric and arrogant character who is transformed once he experiences a supernatural event. In Groundhog Day the transformation is much more subtle while at times it does go to dark places. Ironically Bill Murray went on to play Scrooge in one of the many adaptations of Dickens' classic tale. Murray is the heart and soul of this film and although he is hard to like at the beginning of the film there is something about his performance that keeps us interested in him. This isn't one of those laugh out loud comedies (I don't think I laughed at a single scene), but it is so charming that it is impossible to resist and it leaves you with a smile on your face during its entire running time. Once it ends we realize how philosophical this film really was, but Ramis kept us so entertained that we didn't really pick up on it until the very end.The original screenplay for Groundhog Day was co-written by Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin. It centers on a weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) working as a TV meteorologist for a local Pittsburgh station. Phil is an arrogant narcissist who is expecting to work for a more important broadcasting channel soon. On the eve of Groundhog Day, he is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney to cover the annual festivities along with his producer, Rita (Andie MacDowell), and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) with whom he doesn't get along very well. Phil hates this assignment which he has covered over the past four years so he doesn't put much effort into his report. After covering the event an unexpected blizzard forces the roads to close so Phil and his crew are stuck in Punxsutawney for another day. The next day Phil wakes up and realizes he has to relive Groundhog Day all over again and he's the only one that notices that the day unfolds in the exact same way. Everyone else seems to be living the day for the first time, but he finds himself stuck in the same day over and over again like if he were trapped in a loop hole with no way out.The premise seemed boring for me at first considering I thought it was going to repeat itself too many times, but Murray's character is so fun and he relives each day in so many different ways that it managed to keep me entertained. At first Phil feels like he has gone mad and tries to rationalize things, but once he realizes his fate he decides to take advantage of it. Being the self centered person he is, Phil lives knowing he wont have to suffer any consequences, but eventually he grows tired of this hedonistic lifestyle. He feels so desperate that he tries to commit suicide in every possible way, but no matter what he does he still wakes up the next morning reliving Groundhog Day. Eventually Phil gives up on living for himself and begins looking at others and caring for them. He begins to find purpose and joy in life in helping others. Ramis has made a deeply spiritual and philosophical film without the audience realizing it at first. It could have become tedious and preachy, but it never does because the characters are subtly transformed and the growing chemistry between Phil and Rita is believable. Ramis found a way to reach out to our hearts and remind us that life isn't about living for ourselves, but finding pleasure in helping and caring for others. Groundhog Day is a movie about self- improvement and becoming a better person and I can't think of a better actor to have pulled it off so well as Bill Murray did in his transformation here.",Groundhog Day
89,jimbo-53-186511,"Funny, imaginative and good-natured comedy",7,20 November 2015,"Weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day Event in which a Groundhog is used to predict what kind of weather is to be expected. Phil is generally cynical about this event and vows that this will be the last year that he'll be covering the event. However, after 'covering' the event Phil wakes up at 6 o'clock the next morning (and every morning thereafter) and finds himself living the same day over and over again.On paper, Groundhog Day really shouldn't have worked anywhere near as well as it did. The premise of having a weatherman reliving the same day over and over again could have been a monotonous bore in the wrong hands, but Ramis and co really make the most of the premise meaning that it generally works well on every level.I think what makes this film works so well is that the writers really went to town in an attempt to explore as many possibilities (both good and bad) of living each day exactly the same as the previous one. As a result of living the same day every day Phil inevitably goes through various emotional stages - denial, anger, frustration, depression, acceptance. Each aspect of the story is handled well by Ramis and co and no aspect stays longer than is necessary.The script is good here, but so too are the performances from MacDowell and Murray. Murray has the difficult task of taking his character through each of the various emotional stages and gives a very convincing performance throughout. MacDowell is also good, but she isn't given quite as much to work with. Together though,their chemistry was fantastic and given the journey that they'd shared together I actually found myself believing in their blossoming romance (this is coming from someone who normally gags when they watch anything romantic). Groundhog Day also has a lot of heart to it as well and for this reason it is a very likable film.As well as all of the above and perhaps most importantly the film also remembers to have lots of fun with its imaginative premise - the scene where Phil was driving with the Groundhog was genius. Whilst this film is never laugh out loud funny there were still plenty of amusing moments.Are there any problems here? Well yes, but they are only minor.... The central plot sees Phil living the same day as the last and whilst it is very funny for the most part actually seeing the same scenes being repeated over and over again does get a bit tedious at times - although there are slight variances in each of the repetitions so it's not a major problem. The insurance guy was also really annoying, but he's only in a couple of scenes so again this wasn't a major problem.It's a testament to Ramis and Co as writers that they've managed to create a film about a man living a seemingly monotonous existence and flesh it out to create a charming, funny, imaginative and rather insightful piece of work. Not many films leave me with a smile on my face at the end, but this one did.",Groundhog Day

I now get why it's a highly rated one.Bill Murray is the sole reason for that. His performance here is tremendous, his delivery is absolutely perfect for the role. Cool to see Michael Shannon in his silver screen debut, I like a lot of his work; most notably as Van Alden in 'Boardwalk Empire'.Back to this, the premise is portrayed nicely despite the repeat nature of the events. I do have questions about it, there's a few holes as well as the overall blurred message it attempts to set, but there's no doubting it's a funny film; which is most important when it comes to comedies.In regards to the ending, I expected it to conclude under a different tone. To me, what Phil does during the penultimate revisits isn't massively different to what he does for the final time, the motives seem similar. About the tone, I thought it was going to stick with the one it set around the elderly gentleman but it doesn't.That last paragraph isn't an important matter, I'm certainly over-analysing it, but these are just my thoughts.A must-watch.",Groundhog Day
92,barnabyrudge,"Ingenious concept, enthusiastically presented.",8,9 September 2004,"Bill Murray can be a very funny guy, especially when given roles where his character has a deliciously cruel edge. He has one of those faces, and a voice to go with it, which can make nastiness and sarcasm funny. Groundhog Day is a highly enjoyable vehicle for Murray's talents. It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).Pittsburgh weather-man Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent on assignment to Punxatawney, where on Groundhog Day each year the locals have a tradition of consulting the groundhog to find out if spring is imminent or if they should prepare for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil despises the job and the town, and can't wait to get it over with.... even though he has a soft spot for Rita (Andie MacDowell), the producer overseeing his broadcast. Phil's dislike of Punxatawney, its people and its traditions is set to get a hell of a lot worse though.... as when he awakens the next morning he finds himself reliving the same day. And so it goes - every time Phil gets up, it's still February 2nd and he seems destined to be stuck in the same day for the rest of eternity.It seems early on in the proceedings that the film might run out of steam and inspiration. After all, how can a film about a day which repeats itself be anything but repetitive? Thankfully, Groundhog Day is full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity. The film is laced with memorable dialogue, and Murray gets to play one of the defining roles of his career as a facetious, sharp-tongued misanthrope who ultimately learns the error of his ways. Groundhog Day is a very good film indeed, and restores one's faith in the imagination still lurking beneath the dismayingly shallow surface of Hollywood.",Groundhog Day
93,rooprect,"A famous movie critic was asked what movie deserves to last 100 years, and he said ""Groundhog Day""",10,11 March 2020,"A famous movie critic (who evidently wasn't famous enough for me to remember his name, sorry folks) picked ""Groundhog Day"" as the film most deserving to speak for our society 100 years from now. Director Harold Ramis humbly mentions this in the DVD interview before playing off the honor as essentially a happy mistake. He had no intent or expectation of making anything greater than a whimsical fantasy romcom. He definitely succeeded at making a wonderful romcom, but the more I think about it, the movie critic has a great point and if this flick is indeed the only 20th century film to survive a zombie apocalypse or two, hey I'm not complaining.Cleverly disguised as a breezy fantasy what-if comedy, ""Groundhog Day"" gives us a provocative allegory that would have Plato, Confucius, Buddha & Rod Serling scratching their collective heads and slapping their collective knees at the same time. The story is about a selfish louse ""Phil"" (Bill Murray) who finds himself trapped in a bizarre loop, living the same day over & over.Buddhists, Hasidic Jews, Hindus and Gnostics alike have agreed that this as a wonderful illustration of how reincarnation works (and hey any movie that can get all the religions to agree on something is pretty impressive). Meanwhile psychologists widely applaud this as a fine example of how psychoanalysis & treatment work by revisiting our memories and hopefully learning from them each iteration. Economists have published papers relating Groundhog Day to advanced concepts of ""equilibrium economics"". And last but not least, audiences the world over say this is a hilarious flick. The reason why I've dwelled on all this heady gobbledygook, rather than the plot, is just to entice and prepare you for a masterpiece.Ok if you're still with me, let's talk about the actual movie already. ""Phil"" is stuck living the same day over & over, and at the same time he's pursuing his love/lust interest ""Rita"" (Andie McDowell). Can you guess the problem? Yes, if every day resets & repeats itself in 24 hours, that means he has 24 hours to seduce the chick. He tries everything, but for some reason it never seems to work. At the same time, on a deep spiritual level (though Phil is about as spiritually inclined as a damp sponge) he begins to wonder what's the point of doing anything if everything amounts to the same reset/rewind. Phil goes through almost every emotion & philosophy in the book: hedonism, narcissism, nihilism, existentialism, fear, pleasure, rage, and--quite convincingly--a deep depression which Bill Murray pulls off perfectly without sacrificing the momentum of the comedy.Ultimately our protagonist ""Phil"" becomes the amalgamation of the human spirit, in all its triumphs, tragedies, arrogance and confusion. Watch this movie, and in between wiping back tears of laughter, you just may agree with that movie critic who says ""Groundhog Day"" is a film that should survive for the next 100 years.",Groundhog Day
94,Kdosda_Hegen,"Time travel movie, but it's not about time travel.",10,15 April 2020,"Groundhog day is a special film. It is so cute and charming.Short summary of plot - the story is about a news reporter who hates his job and is easily annoyed by everything. Every year he comes to this one small town and makes a report on Groundhog Day, he hates doing it all his heart. One year something different happens, he does the report on Groundhog Day as ussual, but after the day ends, it restarts. He has to repeat the same day all over again. And this happens again and again and again and again, he is in infinite loop, which he can't escape.As simple as the plot is, the character make this movie iconic. Protagonist tries pretty much everything what you'd want him to try, he even has some interesting ideas I could've never thought of. With the rest of other amazing character this movie generates a lot of fun stories what can happen just in 1 day. But this movie is not about fun stories eihter, it's about character developement. Protagonist learns a lot in this movie and his character has drastic changes, but all is so well made, you don't notice the progress or sudden changes, because it feels so natural. Oh and guess what this movie is also very funny and has a great romance too. I can't describe what this movie doesn't do, it's just perfect.",Groundhog Day
95,slokes,Forever In A Day,9,20 September 2013,"A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, ""Groundhog Day"" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry.Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him.""Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future,"" he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed.It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in ""Caddyshack,"" his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, ""Rise and shine, campers,"" calls us back to Murray's film debut, ""Meatballs."" But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like ""Lost In Translation"" and ""The Life Aquatic.""Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: ""I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it.""The repetitive nature of ""Groundhog Day"" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on ""Saturday Night Live."" It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole.Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on ""SCTV,"" frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis.What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a ""glass-half-empty kind of guy,"" as one of Phil's new local friends puts it.The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film.But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as ""Groundhog Day.""",Groundhog Day

He spends most of the film learning what not to do, especially with his love interest with producer Rita(Andie Macdowell).

He is totally egocentric and does not like at all that he has been assigned to go to Punxsutawney and cover Groundhog day. Along with him goes sweet Rita (MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Elliott). Phil, just wants to do the work and leave as quick as possible ( or before that if he gets his say). Well, unfortunately for Phil, a snowstorm (that he himself predicted would miss them) makes leaving town impossible and when Phil wakes up it's Groundhog day all over again. Phil is stuck. Stuck in Punxsutawney and stuck on Groundhog day. What to do? Well, you could perfect the arts or study. You could get dates with attractive women just by trial and error. You could be the biggest jerk in the world or an angel sent from above. You could rob a bank or kidnap a famous woodchuck. Or you could get depressed and kill yourself in a lot of different (more or less creative) ways. And always wake up to the same day all over again. Phil does all that. But how to solve this mysterious riddle so that poor Phil can go on with his life?A funny and interesting movie, with funny little quirks. The story is great, and the concept of it brings a _lot_ of unique possibilities, most of them followed through in the movie. Good work Ramis and Rubin! Murray is great as the sarcastic Phil. He is asked to act out in a lot of different moods and situations and pull all of them off brilliantly. MacDowell is good as well, even if her character is given a secondary role to that of Murray. Elliot's character is even more in the perimeter but he is good and occasionally chips in with a funny tidbit. But mostly, the movie is funny because of a great story, Murray's acting and a nice directing and editing. There is a romantic bit in the movie as well, but in my opinion that is well integrated in the comedic part, which is the one emphasized.8/10",Groundhog Day

This comedy stands alone as one of the funniest and most original movies of the 90's. Not many comedies can be funny and also end with a moral. Groundhog Day has both.

How does one seek to change their ways in a world devoid of such commonalities? Quite a head trip when one really looks deeply into the concept. Murray fully delved into the horrendous nature of self gratification. Once Murray turned into a man who could be a caring an warm individual, his world finally changed.

I love this movie, and I have since I was little. Many kids were first introduced to Bill Murray in films like Ghostbusters or Caddyshack, or simply just by watching him on SNL. For me, my introduction to Murray was from this film, and personally, it's one of my favorite performances from him. The range he is willing to show with his character on screen is really dumbfounding. There is still the hilarious genius we have come to love, but also such a greater depth to him than we have seen in his other works. Harold Ramis provides the script for the film, a deeply original and unique story, as well as the direction, which is perfect in every sense of the word. I feel the pacing is what makes this film so good, because they easily could have made it a comedy and forgotten all about timing and the drama efforts it involves, but its storytelling is so carefully crafted and well-orchestrated you can't help but feel in awe as it makes you feel so much year after year. It may not be as old as some classics like It's a Wonderful Life or as well recognized as Ghostbusters but Groundhog Day is simply a timeless masterpiece that I hope more generations will find and recognize for years to come.

In recent years, movies like Edge of Tomorrow, Happy Death Day and more have begun to utilize the Groundhog Day formula and for good reason. It's fun, yet heavy and thought provoking.

105,Spleen,Some answers (maybe),10,23 September 2002,"Spoilers follow.Two questions might trouble the curious: (1) Why is Phil trapped in Groundhog Day in the first place, and (2) Why (or how) does he eventually escape? We're never told, and rightly so. The answer to the first question cannot possibly matter, unless perhaps it's part of an answer to the second; but while watching the film for the first time the second question, in the form of ""What can Phil do in order to escape?"", preoccupied me, and I thought he was on the right track several times: when he kidnapped and killed the groundhog, when he persuaded Rita to stay with him for the crucial hour, when he tried to save the life of the old tramp (who might, for all I knew, have been Father Time).I think there IS an answer, to both questions, and it is this: Phil is trapped on the 2nd of February FOR NO REASON WHATEVER, and consequently there is no reason whatever for his escape. But let me consider the competing theories first.(1) Phil is reliving the same day again and again until he gets it right. If this is so he may very well have to repeat February 3 a few times, too.(2) Phil is trapped in order to become a better person, and so he is released when he has ""made up for lost time"" and done with Groundhog Day precisely as much as he ought to have done with the previous portion of his life.(3) Phil is reliving the same day until he exhausts all the possibilities, either of the day itself or of the position he is in.  This third hypothesis is a good description of what the film itself is doing - which is why it's such a great film. The FILM does what it can to exhaust the possibilities before it ends, and we feel that it has done so. Of course, it hasn't - it can't have - but perhaps Phil, in the many moments when we weren't looking, has.(4) The same cruel demon which imprisoned Phil in a town he loathes on a day he loathes, sets him free just when he has made a permanent peace with the situation.I like all of these theories, and I will not insist upon mine. (If mine is right, though, two things follow which feel right to me: there was no need for Phil to have escaped at all, and the fact that he ends up with the not-particularly-interesting-or-lovable Rita in his arms was pure accident... even if he lives the rest of his life as though it wasn't.) Why is this a great movie? Not because, in the end, it fails to tell us which of the five main competing possibilities is right, but because it so artlessly (and humourously) suggests all five at once.",Groundhog Day
106,Seraphion,Another nice concept,6,27 July 2015,"The movie's concept for its main conflict is really nice. Able to relive the same day over and over again magically seems to have it's own perks of repetition and learning from mistakes. Too bad that the concept is only developed into a meagerly interesting final product. I've seen Edge of Tomorrow, which uses the same concept, but it ends up better for me due to it took the concept into a more serious matter. Nevertheless this movie can still have good grip on its main concept and took it into quite a good story with nice repeated scenes. Too bad that the ending is only about love and nothing else. The acting overall is quite good for me. Bill Murray's acting is really suiting to his character's reluctance at things.

109,Galina_movie_fan,When the gods wish to punish us...,9,27 April 2005,"In Harold Ramis's ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude. I love this movie  not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance, when Gods want to punish a mean, arrogant SOB, they would not take his sanity away  they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question, what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing? Groundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes; its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes, and it was very convincing. 9.5/10",Groundhog Day
110,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A Different Version of It's A Wonderful Life,8,30 December 2011,"What is it about these movies that star Bill Murray in and they are considered a comedy classic? By many, Groundhog Day is considered one of the greatest comedies, along with Ghost Busters (1984), to ever hit the screen. Either I am just hard to get when it comes to Murray's comedy or maybe Murray really isn't the comedian that he presents himself as. I found this movie to be funny but again, not gut busting funny. I think Bill Murray is a very competent actor but somehow his version of comedy is not as funny as Jim Carrey's comedy.The story of Groundhog Day is more or less similar to It's A Wonderful Life (1946). Bill Murray stars as Phil Connors, a self-centered meteorologist who doesn't give about anybody's opinion but his own. In the beginning I was already disgusted with his character, he was such a drama queen. It was quite pitiful to see Bill Murray be that way, which is how convincing he was at being a jerk to everyone. I hated him just as much as his co-stars did for a while too. Along with Murray stars, Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot as his news crew.As for the comedy element of this movie, many parts were funny. Obviously more of this comes out when Phil Connors realizes he is stuck in same day, everyday. Some of the best scenes are when he talks to an old school friend called Ned. It's funny because it seems like Stephen Tobolowsky enjoyed playing the part of Ned, who is such a weird geek I might add. Even the Flying Dutchman from Spongebob Squarepants has a role in this film. I won't point out who he is because his voice is easy to recognize. The music was contributed by George Fenton who I'll admit although I've never heard his music before has some emotional parts to this film. It really does work especially when Connors is trying to explain himself to people and they won't believe him. What works out the best is how Phil Connors learns to appreciate life than scorning at it. That is the gift of gold from this movie. Even I as a viewer thought when the movie ended, ""Wow, I'm lucky to be where I am right now"", as should any other viewer when the movie concludes.Groundhog Day has a good dose of hardy slapstick and a good cast of actors to help the chuckles keep on coming. Besides that, what makes it even better is the life lesson that is learned in the end.",Groundhog Day

112,Kingslaay,Enjoyable,6,14 May 2017,Groundhog day is a great film and another showcasing the talents of Bill Murray. This is Bill Murray's finest performance I have seen to date. He nails his role as the cynical and self-absorbed Phil Connors and he treats everyone badly. He one day wakes up and finds he has to relive the same day over and over. We see a great transformation in Phil and it takes great talent to pull this off. I had seen Scrooged last Christmas which was a spin on A Christmas Carol. I have to say the plot of Groundhog day was quite similar with a different twist. Both involved characters transforming from mean spirited to happy and cheerful except this film was more enjoyable. The supporting cast give some great performances which enhance the quality of the film. Perhaps the film would have been more enjoyable if the day that Phil relived was more eventful or notable. Besides the event of Groundhog day it seemed quite plain and ordinary despite his great performance. We also are unsure why he relived the days and why it suddenly stopped. I have seen a number of lower rated and similar films that have actually explained their fiction or twists to make them more believable. I think the majority of the voters have positive associations with this film perhaps because it was part of their childhood or nostalgia which makes it a great film to them no matter what.Thankfully for the story it ended when he became more humane and pleasant. Still a decent and enjoyable film.7/10,Groundhog Day
113,PredragReviews,One of Bill Murray's best movies!,9,20 March 2016,"Groundhog Day is a morality piece done in the vein of a classic Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episode. I kind of ""what if...?"" sort of tale that puts a generally successful and selfish man (played by Murray) into a hopeless situation of never being able to escape a single day in a small town. On the surface the story it looks like a situation comedy with Murray's character living the same Groundhog Day over and over. However the further you go into the movie you get some true and believable character development. The fact Bill pulls it off convincingly as well as with his classic entertaining wit is what makes the movie shine.Don't think of the movie as just some lesson to learn and take with you. While it does have that they don't preach it to you. You figure the lessons out along with Phil (Murray), and that makes for a rather deep experience. The movie at its core is a comedy, and it's such a good comedy it's rating among the top comedies of all time by various film associations. It's not just a comedy either as it also has a healthy dose of romance in it. So much romance that it can pass off as a ""chick flick"" for those who are into that. So I guess you can say Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy/Twilight-Zonesque/morality play.Groundhog Day is a truly great film and it works on many levels, as a black comedy, a love story, and a spiritual journey. It's one of those rare films that you can watch over and over and still feel it's impact. Bill Murray deserved an Oscar for his performance and the supporting cast were totally solid too. I defy anyone to see the Ned Ryerson character (needle nose Ned, Ned the head) and not feel the urge to damage him in some way ha-ha. Bravo to Bill Murray and also to Harold Ramis for his excellent directing of a highly original film! Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Groundhog Day

Even when we all screw up, whether one or one billion times over and over again, we must always forgive for all who have made mistakes because in the thick of it all, we as humans are all screwed up in some way. Whether we admit it or not. Local weather reporter Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a condescending, arrogant, sarcastic individual who has been assigned the task to cover a fluff story on Groundhog Day, right in the heart of small town Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania where Punnxsutawney Phil, the groundhog will pop his head out of his burrow, cast his shadow to tell us six more weeks of winter. This doesn't impress Phil who feels like this is insulting to his intelligence. Just as Phil was about to return to Pittsburgh, a blizzard approaches so he ad his crew which includes his producer Rita Hanson (Andie McDowall) and his cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) to spend a night at a hotel in the area. Only to realize that the next day, it's Groundhog Day all over again and everything that happened yesterday repeats itself again the next day and the day after and so on. Phil is trapped in some kind of vortex will tomorrow never comes. What really makes the movie ""Groundhog Day"" work is that underneath the comedy and fantasy plotting is that there's a low- prolific genre of mystery involved as we try to piece the puzzle as to how Phil can get out of this bubble so that tomorrow can come and a new day will happen. While he knows that his every waking moment are the same people dong the same things like yesterday, everybody else surrounding Phil are completely oblivious. And through every repeated day, he always has an advantage. An advantage to go over his day and reconsider his wrong ways and in hopes to change his ways and thoughts and to become a better person. The perfect individual for this task to be a better character is his co-worker Rita, who has been quite patient towards Phil's demands, quips and general lack of courtesy. As the repeated days go by where everything's planted in terms of routine, he starts to become nicer and friendlier to Rita until one particular Groundhog Day, she finally falls in love with him and a new day begins and the curse is broken. Though it's primarily a comedy, there are very high levels of thought-provoking factors we can all certainly reflect upon. Like Bill Murray's 1988 movie classic ""Scrooged"", Murray is playing a similar cranky character going through extraordinary predicaments in order to live through his mistakes and to break through these burdens in order to become a better person. Even though it's a Groundhog Day movie, there is another Christmas movie that has a similar plot as well, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" where James Stewart's George Bailey stuck in a life where everyone's woeful without him. In ""Groundhog Day"" Phil discovers that everyone would be happier if he was not involved in their lives. Directed and co-written by longtime friend of Murray's Harold Ramis, they have collaborated in several films in 1970's, 1980's and like ""Stripes"" and ""Ghostbusters"" and though they had a fallout after this movie, it was nice that Murray and Ramis made peace with each other before Ramis' death in 2014. Unlike ""Scrooged"" which had a more darker, misanthropic edge to its comedy, Groundhog Day"" was lighter in tone and had a more greater feeling of optimism. The change of heart was well executed as the story flowed nicely, I did fall off the edge of my chair laughing at the early scenes as Phil was giving the weather report in smarmy, cynical way and cursing at the curse that brought him on journey to redemption. The film at the time was original in delivery with a well added twist that has morals placed in while it refrains from anything remotely preachy about it.

I've never really seen the creepy side to that song ""I Got You Babe"", but there you have it. The movie doesn't really go for gags, it's just all so wacky and unpleasant at the same time. I don't know why kidnapping a groundhog is funny, it just is. However, it's likely that the real idea is actually a social comment. People don't have time anymore, nothing ever changes, live the day to its fullest, take your pick. That's probably the angle that separates this from a whole bunch of inferior comedies. It's nothing special, but it's nice that's it's there I guess.

When the job is finished he wants to get out of the town as quickly as possible, but a snow storm (which he didn't even predict right) forces them to stay one more day. The next day he wakes up and finds out that it's Groundhog Day again. The same for the next day, and the next day, and the next... And every time he wakes up and starts his day with that annoying song from Sonny and Cher combined with the even more annoying voices of the deejays.This really was an hilarious movie like we don't get enough these days. The humor was right, the acting and the story were very good. This movie really worked. Still, I wouldn't recommend it to younger viewers, not because of some explicit content, but just because I guess that they will not be able to fully appreciate the movie (just like me). Anyway, I reward this movie with an 8/10, perhaps even an 8.5/10",Groundhog Day
118,screenman,Bill Murray...,6,8 March 2011,"Bill Murray gives his usual turn of deadpan comedy in this time-trap feature.Sent once too often on an annual pilgrimage into unpronounceable small-town isolation, he finally begins cracking-up. The job is really beneath his dignity. He quite rightly hates the assignment, and makes no secret of the fact.However, next morning his problems really set in. Instead of being elsewhen, he wakes-up in the same bed, in the same guesthouse, to the same music playing on the radio. It's Sonny & Cher's 'I've got you, babe.' And every subsequent morning is the same. It's Groundhog Day - for ever. First, there's shock and disbelief, but later wretched resignation. His suicide attempts count for nothing; there really is no escape. He can do and say whatever he likes, everything's the same next morning. I've got you, babe.The tale is a 'journey of discovery'. Sadly, it is over-over simplified into a romantic theme. In effect, he's not a very nice person (who is?) and - rather like Scrooge (who he has also played) - must remedy his vices in order to move on.Basically, the acid-test of rehabilitation will be his ability to get his assistant - here played by Andie MacDowell - into bed. It will be an uphill struggle. In due course he begins putting his time to constructive use, learning the piano, ice-sculpture, and of course - decency.Much as I like many elements of this movie - Murray's poker-faced one-line gag delivery is perfectly timed - it contains a slightly insidious anti-male theme that invariably leaves a sour taste. Murray's character is a fairly ordinary guy with ordinary vices. He is certainly no worse than his assistant. When asked what kind of man would meet her preference, about the only virtue she omits to stipulate is the colour of her imaginary paragon's halo. Yet she herself hardly matches those aspirations, and we infer that being female she has no need to. It is this entrenched judgementalism of maleness - especially by a female who possesses no especial merits herself - that I find so inherently sexist. Why should he have to be a diplomat, doctor, professional pianist, ice-sculptor, etc just to win the preference of a comparatively ordinary woman? Why should the selection-procedure be so one-sided and severe?This misandric undertow is what ultimately mars my full enjoyment of the movie. It's sly, and its very funny; but it's too simplistic in its denouement, and I'm just a little tired of seeing men put on the rack for no other reason than being male.",Groundhog Day

This film is also a great romantic comedy between Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. I also like the fantasy feel with the time revolving plot.One thing I find tireless in the film is of the day going over and over again. You would like it the first couple of times but it gets really tiring. I actually wanted the days to stop going over and over again. It felt like a three hour film.The acting by Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are great, having great chemistry. Chris Elliott's performance is pretty funny.If you like fantasy comedic romance, with some great scenes and presents a great moral of the story, you'll like this film as much as me but probably get tired of the repeating days.",Groundhog Day
120,bkrauser-81-311064,It Will Always Be February 2 in My Mind,10,5 February 2014,"They say that a symptom of insanity is repeating the same thing, over and over again, expecting different results. Under those standards anyone with a nine to five is certifiable. Yet you add some magical realism and the comedic abilities of Bill Murray and you have yourself arguably one of the best comedies ever put to screen. Certainly one of the best made in the last twenty years.Groundhog Day starts with a particularly onerous Pittsburgh weatherman named Phil Connors (Murray) sent to Punxsutawney Pennsylvania for the annual Punxsutawney Groundhog Day celebration. He lives that day much like any other day; cynical, reluctant and crabby. Thanks to a freak blizzard that shuts down all travel, Phil and his crew (Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott) grudgingly stay another day in town. Phil wakes up the next morning to find it is once again Groundhog Day with only he having memory of the previous day. Thus Phil is forced to relive February 2 seemingly for all eternity.When first proposed by co-writers Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis (who also directed), studio executives weren't confident that a comedy repeating the same day over and over would keep the audience interested. After all how many times can you see someone say and do the exact same thing hundreds of times without asking for a refund? If you haven't seen Groundhog Day; first off you're a terrible person, and second it's not a movie on repeat.It's a film that dresses an age old hypothetical in new clothes. What would you do if you had all the time in the world? Phil essentially lives forever in a time loop, at first confused, then driven mad, then realizes the potential of his unique situation. He learns everything he can about those around him and improves himself by taking piano lessons, learning to ice sculpt and reading French poetry. How long did it take him to learn all this? Well some say seven years of practice, one hour everyday will make you proficient at anything. Ramis claims that the span of the movie is closer to 10,000 years. Yikes! All that time before internet was readily available? Here to hoping Punxsutawney has a good library.Though focusing on that would take away from the elegant character study and the warm humor of Groundhog Day. Murray transforms from a selfish man into a celebrated pillar of charity and warmth all through the knowledge he has gained of those around him. Does he do this for spiritual transcendence; desire to break the time loop; to get into Andie McDowell's pants; perhaps all, none or something deeper.Over thousands of years of existence humanity is fairly certain of only a handful of things, one of them being we have a unique ability to feel empathy for one another. It's innate and powerful if we only heed to it and one can philosophize that how we structure society, religion and 501(c)3's are largely based on our impulses. Groundhog Day centers on that reality and makes us ponder the value and beauty of human life. When Phil saves a man from choking to death or saves a child from falling off a tree branch he does so out of love for his fellow man.Yet let's not forget, Groundhog Day is ultimately a comedy meant to coax its audience to laugh. Bill Murray's ego-centrism and sighs of futility are the clear comedic highlight of the film and is definitely a career high point for the Saturday Night Live (1975) alum. Yet let's not count out the gregarious supporting work by Brian Doyle-Murray, Stephen Tobolosky and, of course, Andie MacDowell. Also in the mix is Chris Elliott who has the thankless job of playing second fiddle to Murray and somewhat succeeds.The themes of Groundhog Day are benefited by repeated viewing so I highly recommend seeing it again if you haven't viewed it since its last TNT rerun. If you have never seen Groundhog Day watch it as soon as possible and witness a near perfect comedy with a surprising amount of depth. Watch it, and then watch it again, and again, and again. After all everyone can afford to go a little insane every now and then.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Groundhog Day
121,mike48128,A Classic Fantasy Fable: Bill Murray's Best,9,2 February 2013,"Bill Murray will be remembered for the ""Ghostbusters"" films but this is his best. This is a fable that most of us can relate to: what if we could do it all over again? Mistakes, broken promises, fatal errors that ruined our life and cannot be undone. In ""Groundhog Day""' a self-centered egotistic man is ""cursed"" to relive the same 24 hour day over and over again. The spell is broken when he finally gets it right, which appears to take 40 or 50 times. Chris Elliot (the cameraman) gives a surprisingly restrained performance and Andie MacDowell plays ""Rita"" the TV producer. She is a small town girl that wants a better life. Cleverly written with many plot twists. Every day is almost the same but slightly different. For example, Phil robs an armored truck, and dresses in a ""Superfly"" outfit complete with fancy car. His ""date"" dresses like a ""French Maid"". Such outrageous events do not repeat and happen only once. It's always 6 AM again with the radio playing ""I Got You Babe"" and Phil jumping into a freezing cold shower; heading off again to re-tape the same ""Groundhog Day"" segment for a small time Pittsburgh Pa. TV station.Almost a ""10"" but I give it a ""9"" because I do not like the suicidal implications of the film. Phil gives up on himself and decides to die in a very violent manner because he cannot move forward. He jumps off a building. Electrocutes himself. Finally, he drives off a cliff and the truck bursts into a ball of fire; witnessed with horror by his film crew. (The groundhog is ""driving""!) It's both hilarious and terrible to watch. But he doesn't die. He wakes up in bed at 6AM again and again.This film is actually embraced by many religious groups for its unique and unusual philosophical message. Why does the same day keep repeating? There is a hint in the film: Listen for a soundtrack ""ping"" when he washes his hands at 6:01 AM. It's a time warp. Is he being cursed or blessed by an evil supernatural force or an angel? Because Phil finally gets it right, I'm betting on the angel. Like ""It's a Wonderful Life"", the weather doesn't change until the day does. Phil is now a changed man with a purpose in life and finally wins the girl's heart. The last song in the movie is from ""Brigadoon"", the musical about a magical Scottish village, suspended in time. Harold Ramis both co-writes and directs. His best film also!",Groundhog Day

123,Takethispunch,a comedy with a serious message,10,18 December 2016,"During his nightly TV weather forecast on February 1, meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray) confidently reassures Pittsburgh viewers that an approaching winter storm will miss western Pennsylvania completely. He then sets off with news producer Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) for Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the next morning's Groundhog Day festivities. Phil makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the ""hicks"" who live there.On February 2, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney bed & breakfast to Sonny & Cher's ""I Got You Babe"" on the clock radio and the declaration, ""It's Groundhog Day!"" He tapes a half-hearted report on Punxsutawney Phil and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover some of the other events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh immediately. The blizzard— the one that Phil predicted would miss the area—resolves the issue by blanketing the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.Phil wakes to ""I Got You Babe"" and the same announcement from the radio, and soon discovers the day's events repeating exactly as before. Thinking it is a bad dream, Phil relives the day and returns to bed, only to discover when he wakes, it is still Groundhog Day. He discovers he is trapped in a time loop that no one else is seemingly aware of. Phil realizes there are no consequences for his actions, and spends the first several loops in rambunctious behavior, such as binge drinking, one-night stands, and reckless driving. However, Phil soon becomes depressed being stuck in the loop, leading to him to find ways to commit suicide to end the loop, including electrocuting himself with a toaster in a bathtub, and stealing Punxsutawney Phil and driving off a cliff.

125,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,A strangely addictive movie to watch!,9,20 December 2014,"When I first saw this film on the website here and read the plot summary, I couldn't believe a movie about a weather man living the same day over and over again could have such high ratings. Well, after watching it, I can see why! Groundhog Day is somewhat like Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol; it begins with Phil, a cynical, pessimistic, arrogant weatherman, and ends with a cheerful guy who has learned what matters most in life. How the hell did he change? Well, poor Phil somehow finds himself trapped reliving the same day, February 22nd, over and over again. There's no escaping it; he's stuck in the boring little town of Gobbler's Nob with a lot of eccentric people and the two colleagues he doesn't seem to care for very much. As time goes by, it sees as if he's lost his sanity, especially when he begins breaking the law for cheap thrills and committing suicide (he just wakes up unharmed), but he begins to fall for his co-worker Rita, someone he's always seen as sort of a ditz, as he learns that she's actually a very smart and interesting person. He also tries to be a better person and begins to care more about the lives of others, something very unusual for him.It's hard to explain this movie and how it's so effective, you have to see it for yourself to be honest with you. All I can say otherwise is that I really liked it; the soundtrack is great, the acting is great and the plot is comedic and original.",Groundhog Day
126,sme_no_densetsu,A comedy classic and one of Bill Murray's finest,8,19 February 2017,"The protagonist of ""Groundhog Day"" is Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, played to smug perfection by Bill Murray. Covering Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, he and his crew get stuck in town due to a snowstorm. Upon waking the next morning, he's struck with a case of déjà vu and he soon realizes that he's reliving the same day over and over again. Can there be any means of escape? One way or another, he's determined to find one.Bill Murray was the ideal choice for this role. Initially insufferable, we find enjoyment in his character's predicament because it repeatedly places him in circumstances that he can't stand. As the movie progresses, he does many of the things that we would probably do in the same situation, whether for selfish or selfless reasons. Eventually, he becomes a character that we start to root for.The original screenplay won a BAFTA award but it wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. The time-loop concept was pretty novel for the time and it was explored in many ways but I think the thing that really makes the story stand out is the journey of the main character. You'd think that repeating the same day over and over again would make the movie dull but it's Phil's alterations in his attitudes and his actions that keep things fresh.Bill Murray didn't do it all on his own, of course. Andie McDowell was an excellent match for Murray with her wholesome quality and sunny demeanor. Meanwhile, talented supporting players like Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky & Brian Doyle-Murray made sure that the film was comedically sharp.In the director's chair, Harold Ramis brought his comedic touch honed by involvement in classics like ""Animal House"", ""Caddyshack"" & ""Ghostbusters"". Seldom ostentatious, the visuals are mainly focused on enhancing comedic effect. The music, meanwhile, is competent but fairly unremarkable, save for the memorable use (and continued re-use) of Sonny & Cher's ""I Got You, Babe"".All in all, ""Groundhog Day"" is a comedy that fires on all cylinders. An intriguing premise, an interesting story arc & enjoyable characters brought to life by talented individuals combine to make it a comedy that will certainly stand the test of time.",Groundhog Day
127,wisewebwoman,A must see,9,17 October 2005,"It seems to me to be an impossible task to add anything new to the rave reviews this film has received but I'll try.This was made ten years before ""Lost In Translation"" and Bill Murray gets his true first chance to stretch his acting muscles and give us an extraordinary performance as Phil Connors, a careless, arrogant, egotistical weather man.Every year he sets out for Groundhog Day in Puxatawney, Pennsylvania, to catch his namesake coming up and casting a shadow (or not) for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil doesn't even bother to conceal his contempt for all that surrounds him, including his TV audience.Aye, but here's the rub. This year, Phil is destined to repeat this day over and over until he gets it right. Once it dawns on him that he is in an endless spin cycle of the same twenty four hours, he keeps experimenting with it, playing with it, even resorting to killing himself a few times, knowing that he will wake up again the following day and it will be Groundhog Day all over again.Bill brings an incredibly nuanced performance to the transformation of Phil. Andie McDowell (whom I normally despise and put her in the same one-note class as Mary Steenbergen, all hair and non-stop-come-hither eyes) as Rita, his producer who is completely turned off by Phil, plays well against him. But it is not about getting the girl at all.And this is where the movie aims for an incredible target, that of inner transformation for the sake of that transformation alone. In hands other than those of Harold Ramis (who has a small role in the movie also) this lofty ideal could have crashed and burned, but here it is extraordinary to see this egotistical man become of value to himself, tiny step by tiny step.He takes this endless eternity of the same day and starts to learn ice sculpture, piano playing, CPR, among other things. We don't have to see many of his attempts on screen and we are slowly made aware that he has befriended many in the town and is needed every day for aid and comfort and even life saving work.None of the points we observe are two by fours over the head. I would actually use the word ""Profound"" about this film. There is much to mull over, how are we all spending our days, could we be of more value to those around us but more importantly to ourselves if we took the time to become aware.Inspiring on all levels, superlative in both its comic and romantic genius, this film is up there in my 100 best of all time. The message lingers. A must see. 9 out of 10.",Groundhog Day
128,Howlin Wolf,The rare kind of comedy that has repeated replay value.,10,16 August 2007,"... We know the day so well that we feel like we're living it with Phil after only a few viewings, and we enjoy certain moments, but crucially we have the option to turn it off whenever we want!There's a vicarious joy to be had from seeing someone who has the chance to road-test his different responses to events that he knows are going to occur. How many times have you wished you could say something to someone, only for the moment to be forever lost because the perfect comment didn't strike you at the time? The character of Phil Connors gets the opportunity to punch irritating old acquaintance Ned Ryerson, but it's OK because he doesn't seem to take that anger with him into the next cycle - he's tried that solution and he knows it isn't an answer for the future, but it makes him feel better, anyway! How would you deal with the problems you encounter in a typical day? The genius of this screenplay is it seems to have all the variable options for the different situations covered, and it's hilariously funny along the way.The movie may have a simple philosophical base, but the whole thing is cheerfully thorough in its exploration. The repetition might seem a little frustrating at first, but when everything is over you'll realise that it can really be a wonderful life - even if Murray's patented sourpuss expression for most of the film seems like it's telling you otherwise! *""I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster and drank pina coladas. At sunset we made love like sea otters. THAT was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over and over and over... ? ""*, he sighs.

He can take the premise of a man LITERALLY living the same day over and over and make a great movie out of it. I mean how can you not love the guy? His relatable and witty personality just makes up for some truly great stuff that he did with Harold Ramis and Columbia, like this film, Stripes and the original two Ghostbusters movies. Harold Ramis clearly loved Bill Murray as a friend and as a brother-from-another- mother and Groundhog Day is arguably the finest offering that cake from the two's collaborations.I love this movie; it's about repetition but it never gets boring when you watch it again. It's fun to try and figure out how many times the film repeats itself, and it's a strong tale of douche-turned-gentleman.For a movie that's about repeating the same day over and over, the movie itself is one of the most rewatchable movies you'll ever know.",Groundhog Day

He isn't too thrilled with who he's being dispatched to cover it with:a bright new producer(Andie MacDowall)and an unassuming but equally wise-ass cameraman he's worked with before(Chris Elliott). Come the actual event,Phil goes through the motions,then is crestfallen to find out he'll be stuck in Punxatawney THROUGH the day(he was set to leave town that afternoon) and have to spend one more night at a quaint bed-and breakfast where he doesn't fit in.That would soon prove to be the LEAST of his problems,as he begins to relive the same Feb.2nd ad infinitum.Murray's performance here is really worth more than a cursory glance:in having to relive the same day over and over and over(and over)again,his Phil is left open to relive it in both generous and selfish ways. As he continually re-crafts the same routines(And tries,in increasingly more grim fashions to escape it),he begins to learn about things and people he absolutely never would,not the least of which his attraction and affinity for his producer.Director Harold Ramis has been far more cursed with loser material(a remake of Bedazzled,anyone? How about the incomplete idea of Multiplicity?)than good stuff,but here,with Second City and Ghostbusters cohort Murray,he is able to craft a film that,while it seems to be unable to find a way to wrap itself up(and is probably my biggest gripe of this film),is still both cuttingly funny,poignant AND somewhat philospohical in its mien. While I'm not even close to being an Andie McDowall fan(I think this and Short Cuts are the only two films of hers I've thought she was pretty good in),she is a very effectively placed foil. The sub-characters,given the way this film is constructed,are actually asked,in some parts,to CARRY this film more than most movies would allow(including obnoxious INsurance salesman Phil doesn't recall played by Stephen Toblowski,a ""Long lost love interest named NAncy,the other B&B guests and patrons)and it has such fun with quick cuts and restructuring the film's series of events that you could argue this is actually about TWENTY or THIRTY movies in one. Absurd,funny and more than a little off-putting,Groundhog Day is a film that you won't forget soon after viewing it.",Groundhog Day
133,oneguyrambling,"A truly ""Timeless"" classic. (Yeah-yeah, you do better!)",9,27 December 2010,"Groundhog Day takes a sci-fi premise, grounds it with a banal everyday backdrop and then squeezes every last drop of humour out of the premise without obvious sightgags and cheesy jokes.It is, simply put, Bill Murray's best comedic effort, and he doesn't have to resort to hamming it up Caddyshack style, the film that makes best use of his personality by letting him be himself almost.Bill plays Phil Connors, a local small market weatherman who like most others in the role, must turn up the wackiness to add levity to the normal stoic newscast. Phil has vast delusions of grandeur and feels that he is deserved of a far better career fate, even though he seems content with coasting through the working day.Part of a weatherman's lot is covering crappy small town gimmick days like fetes and quirky events, I guess to show that the network understands and supports the ""everyday folks"" in Anytown USA. This particular annual event is Groundhog Day in Punxsatawney Philadelphia, I developed a bad case of RSI just typing that name.Before this film Groundhog Day referred to an annual festive event, purely for ceremony's sake, where locals made a big fuss by dragging a groundhog from a box whose ""powers"" were supposed to include an ability to predict either the end of spring or an longer than usual Winter. (Thanks to this film Groundhog Day now means something akin to déjà vu.) So Phil, his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and the cameraguy Larry (Chris Elliott) cram into a van and head to the venue for a night's sleep prior to next day's telecast.Come 6 am Phil awakes to find the day bitterly cold, and the day's events and weather forecast pan out fairly uneventfully. On the way out of town though a blizzard prevents their departure back to the city and the trio must spend another night in sleepy Punxs-etc, much to Phil's chagrin.The next morning seems somehow familiar to Phil, he finds that for some inexplicable reason he is reliving the events of the previous (Groundhog) day. He has the same encounters with locals, the same discussions with Rita and Larry, he is even expected to give the same weather forecast that he gave (his) previous morning. Phil is a little more than bemused at this turn of events, as everyone around him is oblivious to these new-but-same circumstances. Only Phil is capable of doing things differently; and influencing others to do things differently from the initial day.Kooky ain't it? The strength of Groundhog Day is that it doesn't try to explain how and why the anomaly occurs, but once it is established Phil will be reliving the same day it deals with it in a realistic enough fashion that you accept the situation and wait to see if and how Phil will extricate himself from it. And this is where much of the humour lies, Bill Murray is funny enough to begin with, putting him in a situation where he is able to riff and react to events without much thought of repercussions or responsibility is like letting him off the leash and saying ""Go nuts"" – and he does just that, only in the deadpan can-you-believe-this? Bill Murray way.After the second Groundhog Day pans out Phil goes through many stages: 1) Disbelief. Maybe if I rub my eyes enough this will all change back? 2) Acceptance. Well I guess I can't change this, let's ride it out.3) Manipulation. Well I guess while I'm here I might as well have fun with this.4) Misuse. Exactly what can I get away with? 5) Learning / Planning / Scheming. If I put some thought into this I can pull off something big! 6) Resignation. I've had enough, what can I do just to end this? 7) No escape. Well that didn't work, I give up.8) Desperation. You gotta believe me! I'm not making this up.9) Upskilling & Change. Maybe it's me who is broken? 10) Culmination As Phil progresses through the process he turns gradually from a sarcastic and cynical self-centred b*stard and gradually smooths his rough edges away, sarcasm turns to wit, put-downs to jokes and using people turns to helping people. A little saccharine sounding right? Well perhaps in the wrong hands, but here there is a real sense of achievement once Phil finally gets somewhere. There are down periods too, Phil gets slapped more than a few times, experiences some real loss and failure when dealing with a homeless person, and gives up in the most final of ways many, many times. Other guys with even more time on there hands than I have estimated that Phil spends between 6 and 12 months reliving the same day, that's enough for a lot of crazy moods swings, planning and antics.Aside from all this it must be said that the film is extremely funny, aside from Bill Murray's tour de force as Phil Andie MacDowell plays the straight, slightly bemused love interest role well, Elliott as Larry is OK in a bit role and the people that Phil encounters momentarily, but in the same way every day all add a chuckle or two.Same as Scrooged though not much of this would be as good without Murray, he elevates the material a good couple notches higher, only this time the film was very good before he got involved, his inclusion made it great.Final Rating – 9 / 10.

There are plenty of other valuable takeaways, not the least a caustic appraisal of the modern world and how it can affect us but let's not get too serious - few people have ever had the ability to pull stuff off like this and, for it to remain as entertaining and as fresh as the day it was released, makes Bill Murray one of those few people.",Groundhog Day

Bill Murray easily gives one of his best performances and is perfectly cast. This is simply the best comedy Harold Ramis ever made up to now. This movie has had so many positive comments that there isn't much left to say actually. So I'm just here to throw in my two cents. Though the concept of reliving the same day over and over again is rather original to base a comedy on and the movie is build up flawless, having a lot of funny situations, it still is Bill Murray, with his almost natural sarcasm, that is the main attraction of this movie. I possibly couldn't have imagined another actor playing weatherman Phil Connors. Andie MacDowell was also perfect as Rita, the producer who was practically the complete counterpart of Phil. To put it simple: She loves life, Phil hates it. It even felt okay when those two become romantically involved at the end, 'cause you really want them to (with Rita having such a positive effect on Phil and all).Scriptwriter Danny Rubin really explores every single possible thing one can do when there are absolutely no consequences the next day. Needless to say the possibilities are endless and this movie never becomes boring. Then why am I not rating it 10 out of 10 stars, you might ask. Well, the whole ""grumpy, egocentric person becoming a better man""-thing was a bit obvious. And there's another thing: the fact that Phil falls in love with Rita was totally plausible. After all he's got all the time in the world to get to know here. But Rita only had one day to get to know him. So it's a bit silly for her to, at the end of that day, agree with him to rent a house in Punxsatawney and having his kids. Well, it actually isn't suggested in such an explicit way, but still... You get the idea. But then again, this is a romantic comedy (with an underlying supernatural theme), and one of the best ones out there. And I also liked the fact that the phenomenon of the re-occurring Groundhog Day isn't explained in the end. Nice move, Mr. Rubin. GROUNDHOG DAY certainly is a movie that one can watch over and over, again and again. And who knows, you might even become a better person yourself after watching it.",Groundhog Day
136,RNMorton,It's deja vu all over again,10,15 November 2005,"Pleasant comedy about cocky TV weatherman Murray sent unwillingly on Groundhog Day assignment, who has to live the same day over and over and over... Murray has never been better, in a role that requires more than just quick wit. Equal to the task is Andie MacDowell who glows as Murray's producer and possible love interest. For those interested, writer Harold Ramis estimates that Murray was stuck about 30 years on Groundhog Day. Some of Murray's lines are classics that come back to me again and again. Light touch still addresses bigger issues about how we live our lives with nice bottom-line message. Effective musical score and great supporting cast. On my all-time top ten movie list. Very rewatchable, but then again that would make sense....",Groundhog Day

Most comedies are lacking in some area and therefore don't usually score high amongst voters. I'm pleased to see that this film is on the top 250 list on IMDb, it SOOOO belongs there, because Groundhog Day is just a perfect comedy.Bill Murray is nothing short of sensational as Phil Connors, the man who visits the town of Punxsutawney to cover The Groundhog festival each year. This to him is a boring assignment and he can't wait to get the hell out of Dodge once his job is done. But fate has a another plan for him, as he awakens each following day and it's always Groundhog Day.This is such a well written, expertly performed and hilarious film and it never fails to amuse, no matter if it's the 10th time you're watching it. The premise is very original, and in lesser hands the film's repetitiveness could have gotten tedious, but with this sure-fire script, Harold Ramis's superb direction and, of course, Bill Murray the film is a non stop laugh riot all the way.Recommended for everybody who enjoys a truly funny film.",Groundhog Day

144,aciessi,Fall-Down Funny and Touching,9,12 June 2015,"Of all of the films that span the career of Bill Murray, I may have found my all-time favorite. Groundhog Day is a heartwarming film. A true one, not some clichéd schmaltz you normally associate romantic comedies with. This, to me, is in the same league as Capra. The best film made by the late, great, Harold Ramis. It starts out as the sarcastic comedy that Murray and Ramis are known for (in the vein of Ghostbusters). Then it turns into a psychological dark comedy, of which we follow Phil's decent into madness in cheery Punxsutawney. Then, a romantic comedy, that pays tribute to that age old premise of going back in time, to get the girl. C'mon, you've all had that desire. Then, something really special happens. We see Phil, not only mastering his sensitivity with women, but with humanity, period. Suddenly, Murray transforms into the world's greatest good samaritan, after spending so much time taking advantage of everyone. This is what you call, ingenious story and character development. It's wholesome, but not saccharine. It's incredibly funny and really, unexpectedly touching.",Groundhog Day

A chance to explore everything, and take wild chances without ever being affected, is something everyone would want to experience.Filled with humour, the plot does take a few dramatic turns as well, which will make you feel sad, and really associate with the central protagonist.The ending is wonderful and open, to have the audience invited in to ask plenty of questions, which adds to the enjoyment of the story.The settings are well established, and provide great shocking entertainment throughout, and everything about Groundhog Day is truly remarkable.A sharp plot helped along by comic and dramatic twists and turns with some great performances add up to one of the funniest comedies of recent times",Groundhog Day

A cynical weatherman (Bill Murray) must relive the same day over and over again until he sees the error of his ways.A peerless conceit actually benefits from the comparatively bland, sitcom-ish direction - the main character seems trapped in the same banal episode of his life, and not even suicide works as a way out.

This is Harold Ramis' best screenplay, enough about Bill and Harold, you've seen Andie MacDowell, haven't you? Andie's so gorgeous, so sweet.

When Murray wakes up the next morning it slowly dawns on him that it is Groundhog Day yet again and he isn't just stuck in town he is stuck in time. 
The Good: Every fall newspapers and websites will point out those wacky colleges with their wacky classes. You know the What if Harry Potter is Real? at Appalachian State Univ. or Philosophy and 'Star Trek' at Georgetown. I would take a course that examines the philosophy behind Groundhog Day. Heck, I might join a religion that embraces the same.It is such a simple premise and yet Director Harold Ramis and star Bill Murray take it some many wonderful wacky ways. In reality, for most of us through most our lives we live the experience of Groundhog Day. Every day is the same. With the same people and the same conversations in the same town eating the same food. The twist is that in Groundhog Day the universe resets at 6:00 am to the tune of ""I've Got You Babe"". As a result there are no consequences for your actions. You learn from the previous day and the board is reset with no one the wiser. This allows the character to go to a dark place of human nature (This being a romantic comedy Murray really doesn't go very dark). Groundhog Day predates modern choice-based video games by around ten years yet it is a prime example of (to steal from TV Tropes) Save Scumming to get that Golden Ending. Keep repeating the same actions over and over again till you get that perfect ending or in the ways of my new Groundhog Day religion... Nirvana. The Bad: Well it is a nineties Romantic Comedy so the soundtrack has to be awful. Not Bridget Jones Diary awful mind you ""(It's Raining Men... really?) but pretty awful just the same. There is a Nat King Cole song at the end (but of course there is) and that Sonny and Cher earworm on the clock radio but it is composer George Fenton that wins the top honor with a horrible funk mess containing on the nose lyrics called ""The Weatherman"". The Ugly: Before you go to bed think of how many days actually take place over the course of the movie.... Yeah, that is a bit frightening.In Conclusion: Before ya, all go reboot this with Jonah Hill or something please keep in mind this movie only works with Murray.

Bill Murray plays a generally bitter, unpleasant weatherman who turns on the charm while the cameras roll but tumbles backward into mean, icy sarcasm just as soon as he's out of the frame. Forced to relive the same day on an endless loop, a much-loathed Groundhog's Day on-location report, he slowly works through his issues, loses the chip on his shoulder, finds personal fulfillment and learns how to share a meaningful moment. It's a simple idea, thoughtfully explored, that doesn't run short on heart, ideas or surprises. Murray is perfect in the role, able to convincingly evolve from contemptible jerk to charismatic goofball, but it's the in-between steps that really make his journey remarkable. His growth doesn't come without pains and struggles, missteps and setbacks, and we share his agony over those tough lessons and bitter disappointments. By the time his sentence in that circular purgatory is at an end, he's hit rock bottom, explored his darkest impulses, reached out for salvation, failed, improved and found peace within himself. Andie MacDowell is adorable as Murray's co-star, the ever-optimistic, spritely target of our affections, while director Harold Ramis gives the whole package a warm, friendly sensibility that keeps things on the up-and-up and still allows some wickedly dark material to sneak through.

152,rzajac,A realization,10,20 August 2008,"I just realized one of the reasons this movie is so great.It's great because it flew under the radar of the producers.So many movies succumb to ""producer syndrome"", where the movie starts out great, but then turns sour and ends badly. And that's because ""the suits"" get cold feet, decide to overthrow the director's vision, and start dictating artistic direction halfway through. It derails the film; and it never fails to sicken me when I see it: Films that suffer from this syndrome could have been great if only the producers hadn't panicked.Groundhog Day was a perfect movie to avoid this problem. Sure, it's got a pithy narrative with ""heavy"" dramatic interest and serious darkness, but when the suits asked, ""Look, does he get the girl?"" they could, in good conscience, say ""Oh, you betcha!"" And when they asked, ""Does everyone live happily ever after?"" they could answer with a hearty affirmative.And they achieve these producer-appeasing ends with a narrative in which, yes, (almost) everyone winds up happy, but all dues that need to be paid get paid, in full, and the process by which Phil is redeemed has a surprisingly honorable depth and resonance.So I was telling a friend that this movie surprised me because the influence of the producers was backwards; you see their influence in the beginning of the movie, but then they back off and let the creative people have their way. And they bring the story home; good and firm and safe and sound.And happy!",Groundhog Day
153,Ruskington,Peak Bill Murray,7,8 April 2020,"While I do think many people go overboard with their praise of this movie, Groundhog Day is nevertheless a highly inventive quirky comedy and features one of Bill Murray's best performances. I feel like this could potentially have been a massive flop had anyone other than Murray been cast in the lead role, especially given that his co-star Andie MacDowell is completely devoid of charm in every role she plays. Murray is as dry and biting as ever but still manages to make us fall in love with Phil Connors and feel every inch of his anguish, despair and humility.I do find the underlying premise a bit disconcerting, however. The idea that Connors has to achieve some kind of moral perfection in order to win the heart of a fairly uninteresting woman so that he can be freed from his purgatory is, at best, a little odd and at worst, quite grotesque. I really wish he had broken free from Groundhog Day on his own, with his romantic future still undetermined.Regardless, this is one of those films you just need to watch at least once in your life.

Groundhog Day is one that needs little introduction, and I only finally watched it recently on the Feb 2nd anniversary, with the retro showings meaning that it was finally time to catch up with this old classic. We see our lead in a timeless loop, and as this is the deadpan Bill Murray, he is funny and heart breakingly emotive. What we see is our hero stuck in this loop over time (long time) go through the motions and find his true character. Partnered by Andie McDowall, he is in love with her, but his awkwardness makes it difficult to create a connection with her. He loves her but can he make her love him?This film is funny, it's beautiful and it's touching. The idea is a comedy & romance version of those old Twilight Zone episodes, and it could easily have gone so horribly wrong.

The concept of this film appealed to my imagination: a man repeating a specific day, Groundhog day, over and over again.With time, this man Phil Connors(Bill Murray) learns to turn every situation and encounter to his advantage. Some may think that this guy is evil since he can toy around with anyone without getting implicated. Bill Murray was the ideal character for this film since he is egocentric and sarcastic. His has the ability to make you laugh while remaining straight-faced. Only a few actors have this precious ability. The other noble person in the film is actress Andie MacDowell.

157,TheNorthernMonkee,philosophical comedy genius,9,14 July 2005,"SPOILERS It's almost unheard of for a piece of comedy genius to also be so deeply meaningful and philosophical. Yet, in 1993's ""Groundhog Day"", writer Danny Rubin has created something very special. Hilarious at times and often quite deep, this film is deservedly praised by everyone who sees it.Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant news reader. Travelling to Puxatony to witness the world famous Groundhog Day, Connors finds himself repeating this day over and over. With none of his actions affecting his life, Connors firstly experiments with life before realising that he could well be stuck repeating this same day for eternity.This light hearted comedy is perhaps Bill Murray's finest performance. Going through a renaissance of sorts since the Millennium, Murray has evolved into a much more serious actor. Deservedly Oscar nominated for ""Lost In Translation"" (2004), Murray is at his funniest all these years back in 1993. Rude and self obsessed to begin with, the transformation of Murray's character is pure genius as he relives the same day continuously until he learns the error of his ways and wins the girl (played surprisingly well by Andie MacDowell).The social commentary of this film is absolutely superb. The way Connors is able to often deceive others with prior knowledge is superb. As, most notably, is the way that Andie MacDowell's Rita can so magically change her opinion of Phil the second that she finds out that he plays an instrument. Rita is actually just as superficial as Connors and truthfully it would be brilliant to see how well the two coped over the following few months after the film ended.Personally the finest Philosophical story about this film is the death of the old homeless guy. Irrelevant of how Connors acts, this man always dies at the same point of the day. As the doctor says 'it was just his time'. This quote is brilliant because it suggests that however we live our lives, when we are due to die, we are due to die. This is one of the most important, most powerful, messages of the film, and it is delivered with subtlety and beauty. Full marks to director Harold Ramis for this one five minute period of skill.It's easy to over think the intelligence of ""Groundhog Day"". Yes first and foremost it is a comedy, but it is also incredibly easy to see more depth in a generally simple comedy. So, as a comedy, let us consider it's main points. Well, firstly it is a hilarious piece of work which is well written and adequately shot. Secondly it is brilliantly acted by everyone involved, including the usually awful Andie MacDowell. Finally, it is a feel good story which leaves you with a smile on your face. So whether you think of the film as being deep or whether you view it as a simple romantic comedy, it is perfect on either level. It is genuinely an excellent film.Brilliant on so many levels, ""Groundhog Day"" is one of the finest romantic comedies of all time. Daft but entertaining, it features a great performance by Bill Murray as well as a potentially deep message. All in all, it's just a superb entertaining film and it should be watched at all costs.",Groundhog Day

Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a weatherman who along with co-workers Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and Larry the camera man (Chris Elliot) are sent to cover the weather report in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, United States for Groundhog day. Phil is most displeased but swallows his pride and goes through with it. After having a less than perfect February 2, he goes to sleep and wakes up on the exact same day. Over and over Phil finds himself in February 2,1993 with the exact same events occurring and he's the only one that knows about it. With this he starts to act out which includes expressing how he really feels about the entire celebration. It's a very funny movie with Murray's trademark sarcasm but it also can help you relate to some real life problems. Everyone feels like Phil sometimes. We are all forced to do things we don't really want to for work and that's exactly what we see here. I can definitely recommend Groundhog Day.",Groundhog Day

163,Blue-Grotto,25th Anniversary!,8,24 January 2018,"The day depends on how you look at it. This truth really sinks in for celebrity weather reporter Phil Connors in returning to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover Groundhog Day. Oddly enough, he wakes each morning at the same time and place as the morning before and, unlike everyone else, retains memories from the proceeding day. At first Phil, selfish and shallow, utilizes the new-found knowledge to take advantage of others; stealing the hearts of beautiful women and bags of money. Telling people what they want to hear, of which he has uncanny knowledge, works like a charm. This is until he attempts to woo Rita, the network producer. Phil works relentlessly to get into her head and appear to like everything she likes; French poetry, the piano, acting spontaneously, ice cream and kids, yet Rita is not so easily deceived. No matter what he does, she sees right through him. To win Rita's heart, Phil must change his own.In the 25 years since this film was released it has found a place in the American psyche. This feel good combination of comedy, fantasy and romance currently ranks #233, five places ahead of Jaws, on the widely used film database IMDb. This popularity has much to do with the film's valuable lessons regarding self-awareness and sincerity, and with the appealing star power of Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell (both are excellent here). Despite its simplicity and awful B-movie quality beginning, the film attains unexpected heights in spite of itself. This mirrors the path taken by the main character as well as the film's 25 year rise in cultural esteem. This was the first time I watched the film. Michael Shannon makes a surprising appearance.",Groundhog Day
164,Darkside-Reviewer,What would you do with eternity?,9,23 November 2019,"Groundhog day is a cleverly written comedy that follows Phil Corners (Bill Murray) a weatherman who travels with his producer and cameraman to the small town of Punxsutawney to do a news report on a groundhog day tradition he begrudgingly does the report and makes it through the day hating every minute of it but at the end of the day when he falls asleep and wakes up reliving the exact same day again groundhog day at first he thinks it was all dream but every day at 6am he wakes up in his hotel bed to the same day over and over again but he decides to have some fun with the power he has seducing women drinking and eating anything he wants stealing crashing cars etc but no matter what he does the just just resets and begins again and again same place same time before long he sees this as less a gift of time and more like purgatory forced to relive the same day over nothing changing going to the extreme to try to end it but nothing changes still and he begins to seriously question his sanity his existence and his life choices but unlike other people he has the all the time in world to become a better person.
Groundhog day is unlike any comedy you have seen before the story is unique and thought provoking and the comedy shifts in tone throughout starting out quite light hearted and sarcastic then mid way through shifting the tone to a more serious and dark comedy making you laugh while also making you think about what you would do if faced with the same situation cleverly written and with Bill Murray as the star your guaranteed to laugh.If by some miracle you haven't already seen this classic movie I urge you to watch it weither you like Bill Murray or not you will love this movie and find yourself laughing and crying till the end.",Groundhog Day

166,sashank_kini-1,Warm and delightful with a universal message,8,25 August 2011,"The most striking thing about Groundhog Day is its relatability. In India, there is an ongoing clash between Anna Hazare, a social activist and the Indian government. The issue is the introduction of Jan Lokpal Bill- a bill that employs tougher measures to root out corruption. Anna, with his countless fasts and the government's constant rejection of the former's proposed bill is entering into a log jam. The Indian news channels that cover this issue keep rambling every single day without even throwing light on other issues like the zeroing in on Gaddafi etc. Whenever I switch to the news channels, I feel so bugged by the repetitiveness that I switch over to movies, and that boredom got me to Groundhog Day, and I was actually delighted by the movie. Very few movies are able to take a simplistic plot and retain its sweetness and also send the message across subtly.Phil (Bill Murray) is an egocentric, apathetic and caustic reporter who does his duty mechanically, insults his colleagues and keeps quibbling for a better life. His companion Larry (Chris Elliot) too is indifferent to him. When the two of them, along with an optimistic, bright and large-hearted reporter named Rita (Andie MacDowell) have to cover an annual event called the Groundhog Day in the quaint, difficult-to-pronounce town of Punxuntawney, in which a groundhog decides whether spring would come or not, depending on whether its seen its shadow or not, Phil gets even more agitated, grumbling and 'prima donna'. He even looks down on the generous and simple-minded town folks and avoids his over-zealous, annoying old classmate Ned (Stepher Tobolowsky). Groundhog Day turns out to be a failure with the groundhog prognosticating that the town wouldn't see spring for the next few weeks, and Phil, Rita and Larry can't leave the place because of a blizzard. However, this is nothing compared to the one that befalls Phil later. He wakes up the next day to find that it's Feb 2 again and he has to relive the day again and again. How Phil turns this curse to a blessing is what the movie is about. The first question that came to my mind while watching the film was that how was it going to be different and keep me engaged for more than 90 minutes? I'm eighteen now and there so there was a time when I loved Disney shows and this time loop phenomenon has been done on quite some Disney shows. Also, I was slightly put off when I came to know that this was a time loop story, since I already had pictured some predictable sequences in my mind, which thankfully didn't occur. Yeah, Phil is flabbergasted and confused, he does seek for solutions and there are other predictable things done by him, but nothing dampens the mood of the film. And this is because 1) The performance by Bill Murray is natural and 2) The screenplay never turns corny. Phil does everything to push the day forward, failing every time. He first acts funny, doing random stuff, then goes ballistic and kills himself in different ways, acts like a jerk to everyone around him, then tries to seduce Rita, only to wake up to the tune of Cher and Bono and morning radio. What he realizes eventually that his time may seem monotonous to him because he never lived his day to the fullest. That's when Phil decides not to live the day for himself but for everyone around him. This may sound too clichéd, but thankfully it is handled with care and finesse. The humor in the film is spontaneous and restrained, never going overboard, even at the most desperate moments. Some of my favorite digs are the one where déjà vu is mistook for a beverage and the 'Don't spoil it' by Andie MacDowell towards the end. The auction scene too is hilarious. The best part is the flow of the humor, not too little, not too much. The acting is strong. Murray becomes Phil, and plays his character truthfully throughout. I agree with Roger Ebert that Bill was tailor-made for this role. Had this role gone to other actors, it wouldn't have been so sincerely played. Let's look at a few examples:1) Jim Carrey- 'OH this can't BE HAPPENing! I'm going crazy, yeah! I'm GOING CRAZY!!!"" And the crazy gestures and hyper-acting.2) Ben Stiller- 'Oh no, I can't believe this is happening!"" Blank stare at the wall, puts pillow over his head. 3) Gerald Butler- (I know he is new but it's just an example) ""Sex. Yeah, sex!"" And nothing else.4) Adam Sandler- A complete no-noThe rest of the cast too shoulders the film quite well, especially Andie, who has to play the same scene again and again, each time refreshing her act. When Phil decides to improve himself, he does not make the day perfect for him but for everyone around him. His perception towards the townsfolk changes. He gets a couple married and gives them tickets to Wrestlemania (LOL!), helps a few others and even plays the piano! And everything falls in place, as for the very first time he spends the night with Rita without getting slapped. And that's when he has learned his lesson and in Phil's own words, ""Today is tomorrow!"" A very poignant moment is when one realizes that Phil on his final day does not take advantage of Rita, and decides to sleep instead of going third-base hastily and ruining everything.To be special, a movie has to have its moments. Groundhog Day has lovely, breezy moments and gives a slender treatment to its script. My rating: 8/10",Groundhog Day
167,ctomvelu-1,Deja vu all over again,10,22 March 2009,"GROUNDHOG DAY is a masterpiece that has been often imitated, but never equaled. Bill Murray in his prime plays a cocky and horribly bored weatherman who travels to the tiny town of Punxsatawney, Pa., for Groundhog Day and finds himself stuck there on the same day over and over again. At first, he makes a game of it, then he tries killing himself, and finally comes around to realizing he's been given a second chance. You've seen the plot before, but never so well done. Andie MacDowell, also in her prime, costars as Murray's love interest. The writer (Dan Rubin) and director (longtime Murray cohort and GHOSTBUSTERS costar Harold Ramis) really outdo themselves with this clever film. This is the first film I have ever given a 10 to. It is well-deserved.",Groundhog Day
168,Bogmeister,Today is Yesterday Ad Infinitum,9,18 December 2005,"A fantastic premise done up with comedy and irony: when Phil (Murray) subtly hints at the beginning how repetitive his 4th time (4th year)reporting in that little town for Groundhog Day seems to be, he has no clue as to what's in store - what repetition really is. This is the amusing version of the chilling half-hour version of ""12:01"" where the poor guy repeats an hour. There was also a more mundane ""12:01"" TV movie, also with one day being repeated, which was still entertaining. But this has Murray, who besides expectedly delivering all the goods on the funny aspects of the same day premise, has to also convey some of the wistfulness and despair associated with such a dilemma. To the film's credit, the story doesn't hold back on showing the full potential of such a wild concept: Phil relives the same day for years, gaining new talents & disciplines in the process, and running through the whole gamut of emotional arcs as all that special time passes: shock, bewilderment, recklessness, debauchery, suicide (the aforementioned despair), delusions of godhood and finally a kind of serene acceptance of his strange situation - this last can be construed as 'giving in' to the cosmic joke or lesson played on him.The story has some minor weaknesses: most viewers will notice, for example, after a 2nd viewing, that Phil's music teacher is taking credit for his musical genius at the end even though, for her, only one day of teaching has occurred. Surely, Phil showed her he was very adept at the start of the lesson (unless, he feigned total ignorance of music at the start of the lesson and let her think he so improved after a couple of hours - but this leaps into silliness). There also seems to be a scene missing with respect to Phil's relationship with Rita (MacDowell). I never was clear as to how or why Phil became enamored of her and eventually in love. Of course, he must have been observing her for many days as his day repeated until he came to this realization, but still, this happens suddenly and without any hint of such feelings surfacing prior to his calling her name while making out with another woman. But, overall, the concept was well thought out and well written for this version. As with the better films with such far-out concepts, questions arise afterward - why Phil? Does this happen to other people? To many other people? To everyone at some point? When will it happen to me? It's also a convenient explanation for the deja vu syndrome.",Groundhog Day

As well as telling the rarest of all plots for movies especially for a comedy reliving the same day which really would be annoying if that happened in real life, (of which was Ramis' message.). This movie is one of the best comedy movie that I have seen in a long time thanks to both Bill Murray's and Harold Ramis' comedic genius as well as a movie that made me have more appreciation for comedy movies even though I like more serious types of movies.

The story is excellent, the cast is fantastic, the acting is superb, the comedy is right on, this film ROCKS!!!Bill Murray pulls off one of his best performances to date (along side ""What About Bob?"" and ""Ghostbusters"").  It's amazing how he's such a b**tard in the beginning of the film, but you still like his character in a weird way, and by the end of the film you really do like the person he has become. Andie MacDowell also pulls off one of her better performances.  Throughout the film you really like her character and she's not that hard on the eyes either.  Chris Elliot, Brian Doyle-Murray and Stephen Tobolowsky also deserve some credit for their work in this film, they both play their parts quite well.  Also, I feel I should mention Harold Ramis, he did a superb job directing this film, he really is an under-appreciated director.  Great job Harold!As I mentioned above, the comedy in this film is right on.  There are so many scenes that my friends and I love repeating to each other and get us laughing just thinking about them.

175,policy134,"Not a slob movie like ""Meatballs"" and not really ""Rushmore"" but really something",8,5 January 2007,"I have seen this many times and one thing I can say about Bill Murray is that he must have been kicking himself that he wasn't doing something like this much sooner instead of treading water through most of the 90's in such failures as ""Ghostbusters 2"" and later ""The Man Who Knew Too Little"". Later he had a spectacular comeback in ""Rushmore"" but if he had continued making this kind of fascinating films he could have eased his transition to ""exciting character actor"" much faster.This is such a great premise: A man living the same day over and over again and to top it off, a day that he thinks is one of the worst days of his life. If the film had taken a direction in which the Murray character was a nice person it wouldn't have been as much fun as when we learn that he has contempt for almost everything in his life. This character is a variation on the character Murray played in ""Scrooged"" but as we go through his transformation to ""nice"" we sort of buy it this time. In ""Scrooged"" the transformation was a lot more forced.Add to that, a brilliant performance by Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned Ryerson. It's hard to play annoying and still make it funny but Tobolowsky is a pure treat to watch here. And as the icing on the cake we get Chris Elliott in his least memorable performance and I mean that as a good thing. Andie McDowell is sweet and cute but she is totally believable as a character who doesn't have a clue about Murray's situation and still thinks that there is something familiar about the whole thing she experiences in this one day.I am not saying that this is a masterpiece but it is easy to see why the director Harold Ramis and Murray was such a great partnership. Ramis knows how to build a scene and he knows comedy. Still, the movie tends to drag in the scenes that are supposed to be serious and the movie kind of ends abruptly after Murray wakes op next to Andie McDowell. But this has absolutely been my favorite Murray film ever since I can remember. The groundhog is cute too.",Groundhog Day
176,Horror-yo,Comedy classic with a fulfilling meaning,8,21 May 2016,"Bill Murray stars in this absolute classic of a comedy, a comedy written in a way most mainstream American comedies attempt but fail badly at: a story with lots of funny moments, and an actual morality at the end that rings true, genuine and somewhat deep. Lots and lots of funny moments in this uniquely (at the time) structured film, and whether you're a Murray fan or not, there should be enough in those scenes to make you at least partake in the fun. This movie has this sort of a contagious grip on the viewer like it's a kind of game (as Murray's day keeps on repeating on perpetual loop). A movie that's had many generations laugh out loud, and movie-makers directly inspired from it. In the madness of his ""now-daily routine"", Murray seeks redemption, and isn't that endless loop perhaps a metaphor (that he wasn't doing the right thing in his daily life), and highly reminiscent of the perpetual torments in Greek mythology ? Comedy classic. Should be seen.",Groundhog Day
177,garethcrook,"""I'm A God""",9,7 August 2019,"Groundhog Day has taken on a life way beyond its 90s comedy status. The day itself before, was known only in America as being synonymous with the weather. That completely changed when the late Harold Ramis wrote this Bill Murray vehicle. Now it's a worldwide pop-reference for repetition. So simple, utterly fantastic, absolutely hilarious and much more than just an endless loop. Has Bill Murray ever starred in a bad film? Probably, but I don't think I've seen it. Murray you always feel is playing his characters with a good dash of himself included. Bill doesn't give does he and neither does is character here, whether it's nasty Bill at the start or the reborn nice Bill at the end, Bill still has his edge. He feels so natural, it's easy to believe it's all improvised. He's brilliant. Andie MacDowell is the opposite, she's bloody annoying, as sickly sweet as the small American town in which it's set. There's an odd message to this film though, it seems to be about redemption, a bad soul making amends, but there's an undercurrent of manipulation that's quite sinister and points out some of the worst elements of some human nature. True, Phil does eventually find redemption after a lot of soul searching, comedy japes, worthwhile life experiences and deep suicidal depression... hey even that's given a light hearted twist. But it's troubling to see how long it takes him... an estimated 34 years! I love rewatching these kind of films, it's amusing to spot little things you may have missed before, be it little details or even actors, who were unknown at the time, like Michael Shannon playing the newly-wed Wrestlemania enthusiast. Yes it's schmaltzy romcom territory, complete with an end sequence that doesn't quite add up in the interests of happiness, but despite a few formulaic tropes, Groundhog Day is masterful. The premise, the arc, the characters (annoying or not), the intentionally choppy timeline, all of it barrels along beautifully... and at its centre, Bill Murray. ""I'm A God, I'm not The God"".

Bill Murray is great, and the idea of being stuck in the same day is a fun premise.And then I saw it again recently. And again. And I actually started pondering what was going on in the film.And you know what? It's a delightful film, but it is also rubbish in terms of philosophy.Apparently Bill Murray has to spend an eternity bettering himself so he can deserve Andie MacDowell. But what does she have to do? Apparently nothing. Let me tell you something: If Murray became such a wonderful human being, he would have no interest in that selfish, self- obsessed, insipid tart. I mean, look at that woman: She imagines to be a morally superior princess that no one deserves. That is how she justifies the fact that she is still single. She proceeds to toast to 'world peace' and imagine to be a mother to a bunch of children, but in reality she'd probably divorce the poor bastard she married before they could even have a child. This is one cold woman and it doesn't even take a single day of self-improvement to figure that out.So not only is this film illogical, it is misandric.I give it two stars: one for Bill Murray and one for the hog.",Groundhog Day
181,CinematicInceptions,Interesting dramady for all ages.,8,5 July 2015,"The dramady genre is defined almost to perfection by this movie. It's not the most gut wrenching comedy you'll see, but it has a few heavy scenes that most comedies don't. I think they did a pretty good job on it because there are a lot of places where they could have slipped up and didn't. Two examples are 1) not trying to give an explanation for why the time lapse happens since that would have created another storyline with a lot of room for error, and 2) keeping it to a PG rating, because it probably have detracted from the overall effect if we had thirty more scenes of Phil doing everything he would never dare do normally. If you took this exact same concept and put it into a modern movie, it wouldn't be as good. We pretty much saw this exemplified by Click, which had a similar feel to Groundhog's Day even though it was kind of the inverse concept.Our protagonist is egotistical and slightly unlikeable weatherman Phil Conners. We get to see nearly every side of his personality as he reacts to his plight of being stuck in one of his least favorite days of the year. Regardless of how any give viewer feels about his personality, almost everyone will be able to sympathize with Phil to an extent at one point or another. Some people might not like it that Phil ends up a nicer guy at the end and does a 180, but I would argue that it's completely plausible. We can approximate that Phil was stuck in Groundhog's Day for at least a year, probably much more. And he had plenty of time to think along with plenty to think about. Besides that we see his progression from irresponsibility, to depression, to self improvement and generosity. So I think his maturing was completely plausible, though not inevitable. We get to know some of the other characters fairly well like Larry the cameraman, Phil's high school classmate Ned Ryerson, the lady who runs the hotel, and obviously Phil's new co-worker and love interest Rita. I read a review that said Rita was portrayed as too perfect, which might be true, but it might also just be that Phil is so insensitive to her that we don't notice her shortcomings. Besides, for all we know she just woke up on the right side of the bed that particular day and was a horrible person the rest of the time.The comedy is mostly comprised of the different ironic situations Phil gets into from repeating the same day and how he reacts to the differently each day. There are a few good one-liners, but there is relatively little verbal comedy for the most part.You might get annoyed with the repetition of the different events, as Phil does, but it's not very annoying considering that they have to repeat some events several times. This reflects pretty well on the screenwriter(s) with the way they gave the audience enough information, but didn't repeat it. The way they executed the progression of Phil trying to win over Rita was well done, along with him learning the piano and the general knowledge that he gains of the Punxatawny (probably spelled that wrong) residents. It doesn't come off as spectacular, but it's notable that there weren't any problems with those scenes.I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story or plot basis. The acting's fine, and you could argue that Bill Murray has an above par performance. It is properly labeled as a comedy, but there are enough serious dramatic elements that you shouldn't choose it if you're looking for strictly comedy. It's one of very few movies that can be enjoyed by all ages without being completely kid geared, so you can enjoy it equally with your family or on your own. If you don't like Rita's character or the general story after about forty minutes, it's probably not worth your time to finish it out. Overall Rating: 8.2/10.",Groundhog Day

Perhaps that style of humour was all the rage in 1993 but it didn't do the job for me.The best thing about this film is the underlying concept. It's great and has spawned a whole new genre of time-loop films (all of the ones I can think of are far superior to Groundhog Day in truth).

We've all known someone like Phil (Bill Murray), the nasty, burnt-out TV weather man who hasn't got a good word to say to anyone, who is cynical about everything and impossible to get along with. Life has been bad to him, so he's going to be nasty back. In Groundhog Day, by having to live the same day over again and again, it slowly dawns on him that his life can improve, but it's going to take some effort on his part. For example, actually learning to be nice to his camera man. To me, the best scene is when Phil walks into a bar, and declares in despair that it's always the same day. A drunk at the bar remarks that that's what his own life is like. Like a lot of people in real life, I thought. Stuck in the same rut like Phil, self destructing, committing crimes, over-eating and running into the same old people, until they can find a way to break out and make the most of life. The only thing I don't like about this film is Rita, the love interest. She's great when she's producing his weather segment and telling him off for being such a slob, but I felt the romantic resolution was too twee and weird. It's like he finally learns how to manipulate a woman into going out with him. Isn't there something wrong with that? But perhaps I'm too cynical. Maybe it's just that he learns how to love someone.",Groundhog Day
186,acedj,Perfect mix of comedy and thought,10,14 November 2019,"It's that time of year again, and Phil is off to Punxsutawney to see the groundhog. There is a big storm coming, but Phil is the lone weatherman to say it will miss the area. He has a surly attitude and abhors this trip. It is made slightly more enjoyable by the producer Rita coming along. Throw in the goofy cameraman named Larry, and you have quite the dysfunctional trio. Phil ends up in a time loop, doomed to repeat groundhog day for eternity, and he is the only one aware of this. Each day the events of the previous day are erased, along with everyone's memory, except poor Phil.
Now, forget the fact that Bill Murray is far too old to be a romantic interest for Andie MacDowell, and the rest is just plain fun. It is well acted and the jokes are still funny when you've seen this the 100th time. Will poor Phil ever see tomorrow, or will he be stuck forever in groundhog day?",Groundhog Day
187,DavidSim240183,The greatest comedy of the 90s,10,27 March 2004,"Bill Murray is without a doubt one of my favourite comedians. His deadpan, laid back attitude always makes him a hoot to watch. That was one of the reasons why Ghostbusters was such a success. But Groundhog Day has got to be his best comedy since, because this ingenious Harold Ramis film is tailor made for Bill Murray's talents.Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors. A selfish, cynical and sarcastic man, he is not one of the easiest people in the world to like. Every February 2nd, he travels to Punxsutawney, P.A. to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival. Legend has it if the groundhog (also called Phil) sees a shadow, it won't be an early Spring.This is an event Phil hates, and he can't stand the town. This year, he goes there with his cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) whom he insults every chance he gets, and his new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). Phil falls in love with Rita, but can't open up to her in that way, and comes off as arrogant to her.This marks his fourth visit to Punxsatawney, and after Phil (the groundhog) predicts that Winter won't be ending anytime soon this year, Phil can't wait to leave town. But a blizzard unexpectedly strands Phil, Rita and Larry, and they are forced to spend another night in Punxatawney.When Phil wakes up the next morning, he's got a real freaky sense of deja vu. His clock radio is blaring out ""I Got You Babe"", the DJs are saying the exact same shtick as yesterday, and when he looks out the window, people are getting ready to go out. It's Groundhog Day all over again.Everyone else doesn't seem to notice, and to them everything is perfectly normal. What is wonderful about this film is the way it explores every possible angle to Phil's situation and covers such a wide spectrum of emotion. From being initially baffled, to exploiting it for his own gain, depression, suicide, acceptance, and finally, self-reflection.Despite the repetition of this never-ending day, it surprisingly never becomes boring. Although the situations may be the same, you know Bill Murray is going to do something slightly different with it. His reactions are priceless, and he experiments in a variety of different ways.An example is when he runs into an old high school friend, Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky). An insurance salesman who is ingratiating, persistent and extremely annoying. Someone you can't wait to get away from. After a couple of times Phil punches Ned, and then much later, embraces him, to Ned's horror. Stephen Tobolowsky is perfect as Ned, and nobody else could have done the performance as well.I like the part when Phil has different ways of destroying the clock radio, from knocking it off the table, to hurling it to the floor. That's understandable if you had to wake up to ""I Got You Babe"" every single morning. Harold Ramis clearly wanted to be as inventive as possible with this comedy, to keep the viewers interest, which he certainly did.Phil's various suicide attempts are a highlight in a morbid way, because he goes through every death imaginable to try to break this time warp. Unsuccessfully of course.The main focus of the film is Phil's attempts to get it on with Rita. But she is not the kind of person who just wants to get into bed with someone, unlike Phil. Although he does learn things about Rita, he just can't seem to make it work with her. But eventually, Phil gradually realises his shortcomings, and begins to change things about himself.Phil learns to appreciate life more, and begins to care a great deal for the people of Punxatawney. One of my favourite scenes is when he tries to save a homeless man from dying of old age. But every day, he still dies, no matter what Phil's efforts.The film does have a happy ending, but it doesn't feel contrived the way Scrooged was. You are genuinely happy for Phil when he finally wakes up to a Groundhog Day with Rita who loves him in return. Wisely, we never find out what was causing the time warp. It adds to the charm of this film. Any attempt to explain it would have cheapened the impact.This will always be one of my favourite films, and the wonderful range of quirky characters ensure you will always be entertained. Harold Ramis showed a capacity for storytelling on a par with Frank Capra, giving us a benign story about how you can improve yourself today for a better tomorrow.Groundhog Day is a timeless film.",Groundhog Day
188,AvidClimber,Groundhog Day — A deceptively sweet comedy packed with details and some romance,10,8 December 2012,"Groundhog Day is one of my very favorite movie. I watch it on a regular basis because it is packed with details. It's easy to appreciate right away, but its richness takes a while to seep into you because of the subtle way it's presented to you. Only a year ago I finally understood the depth of the evolution of the main character.It's funny, the laughs are numerous and the humor contagious. The romance is key, but almost secondary. The cameraman and the insurance salesman are the only characters that really tick me off, but they still fit well within the whole movie and do not detract you from appreciating this little marvel.The dialogs, which are Bill Murray's strong suite, are excellent.

192,EthanBJones_03,"Seriously, how long did he spend there?",7,7 August 2017,"'GROUNDHOG DAY' Directed by Harold Ramis Starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. Plot Overview: ​Phil (Bill Murray), a weatherman, is out to cover the annual emergence of the groundhog from its hole. He gets caught in a blizzard that he didn't predict and finds himself trapped in a time warp. He is doomed to relive the same day over and over again until he gets it right.The one thing I knew about this film going into it was the premise. I knew nothing else about it - who the starred in it, who directed it, the names of characters; nothing. Thanks to this lack of knowledge, I thankfully had no expectations either way towards the film. I think that worked towards the film's favour. Let me say this, I do recommend this movie and like it quite a bit but I think I would have been extremely disappointed if I had even the slightest expectations. So if you haven't seen the film, I recommend it just don't go in expecting greatness or mediocrity.Movies like this are, to me, concept movies. They thrive of their unique and interesting concept or gimmick and then use that as a crutch. That is why the concept for this movie is a great one and the reason it has inspired works such as All You Need Is Kill(Edge of Tomorrow). The story surrounding this idea is also pretty decent. We follow our protagonist through possibly decades worth of the same day, with a new focus every once and a while. We see him utilise this gift/curse to learn new skills and try to perfect the day. This is the most interesting part of the film for me. The concept of achieving a perfect day. Reliving a day over and over and over again for eternity until you complete it with no error or flaw is fascinating.Bill Murray is great as Phil and succeeds spectacularly at showing the growth of his character. Andie MacDowel was pretty weak as Rita for me and I didn't buy anything she did or said. I did, however, buy into the romance between the two slowly building over the course of a possibly decade. Even if it did feel slightly manipulative, I did definitely see the connection building over the course of the the film. The cinematography and editing for the film is perfectly passable and looks fine.The movie was pretty funny and it's on the upper half of comedies that I've seen. The dramatic moments also work pretty well and are effectively utilised for full emotional impact. If I had one main flaw with the film, it is the very boring and uninteresting first 20 minutes. I'll make an estimate and say the film begins to get good around the point he sees the benefits of this gift/curse. Honestly, I will recommend you see this movie just don't expect the second coming of Christ. I'll rate this film 7 Perfect Days out of 10.",Groundhog Day

Being so familiar with his wry sarcastic nature, we can fully experience his metamorphosis under the Hindu-istic spell of a never changing calendar. Is it a curse or a gift? Andie MacDowell does her best, but it's Steven Tobolosky's wacky insurance sell and the Chris Elliot persona that take the weight off Murray to allow the drama to unfold and Phil Connors to evolve.

As I watched numerous times over the years, I love it. I think this movie has great lessons aimed to the viewer. We have Phil Connors (Bill Murray), a T.V. weatherman out of Pittsburg, P.A.. He will be going for the 4th time in a roll to Punxsutawney, P.A.. Along with him is Rita( the producer) for WPBH; and Larry(Chris Elliott). Phil hates covering the festival, and everything about it. He is hateful, obnoxious, paranoid, and somewhat of a snob. As soon as they get there, Phil can't wait to leave. He just wants to get the coverage, dehumanize his co-workers as well a some of the locals. Once they get the coverage start to leave a big snowstorm hits, closing down the highways. Once back in Punxsutawney, Phil starts to have a case of Deja Vu or so he thinks. The movie cuts and we see Phil in the bed at the bed and breakfast. The alarm goes off and he wakes to the Sonny and Cher song I've Got U Babe. He wakes as is usual self grumpy; and the radio is playing the same music, saying the same lines as the day before. He is stuck in Groundhog Day again and he's like W.T.F.. As the movie goes along he starts learning how to become a better human being, but the day will start over again if he fails to learn from his mistakes. As the movie proceeds we see Phil develop a romantic relationship with Rita, help a homeless man by bonding with him, take up piano lessons; and come to the aid of Buster( Brian-Doyle Murray)who was choking. This movie is about feelings, relationships, and humanity. This is a touching story, sometimes we forget how to treat each other with respect. To me this is not a romance movie; but a movie about human interaction.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",Groundhog Day
199,mOVIemAN56,Awesome Film. One of Murray's Best,9,19 May 2005,"What can I say. i've probably seen this movie twenty times and it never gets old. Murray is perfect in his role and so is Andie MacDowell. The story goes like this. Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a cynical weatherman from Pittsburgh. It's February 1 when him and his crew, Rita (Andie MacDowell) and Larry (Chris Elliot) go to the small town of Punxsatawney to film the groundhog awake. Phil has a miserable day and is awoken February 2 to the sound of Sonny and Cher. He goes out to the Groundhog grounds and gives his usual performance. Afterwards the crew packs up to leave but can't get back to Pittsburgh due to weather. They spend another night. The next day Phil awakes to the sound of the same Sunny and Cher song and discovers it's February 2 again. What could be going on? Now Phil repeats February 2 again and again and again for days, months, even years. What is this purpose. Is it internal damnation for Phil being cynical or an idea for Phil to change his ways and help people. What do you think?That's what you'll be thinking each time you watch this film, right up to the very end. Bill Murray is absolutely perfect for his role. Andie MacDowell is a real strong female presence for the film and Chris Elliot has some good scenes as the camera man. The plot is next to perfect, an ultimate torture type world for Phil. Each day repeats, he does whatever he wants, and the next day he's back to new. The movie really gets you thinking about are more cynical side and how we represent that dark side everyday. The movie will bring a laugh and at some points almost make you cry. Murray deserved an Oscar for this performance and shows that he is capable of being a great actor, better than he already is.Groundhog Day.

This is his fourth year doing the story and makes no effort to hide his frustration.

One man, living the same day over and over again, eventually decides to make the most of it and he is changed forever.This movie is genuinely funny and it can't help being so. What person wouldn't find that concept funny? Even if it gets annoying eventually, it remains funny in the pit of your stomach because Phil is such a jerk in the beginning that it's hard to feel sorry for him. When we start to see his transformation, we see something that hits home for all of us: he is misunderstood. He wants to quit and turn back into a jerk. But eventually, even Phil Connors pulls through.Proof that given the chance, pretty much anyone can find happiness. It's all in your mindset.

The positive message and moral are well conveyed while still keeping a lighthearted, disengaged tone. Almost like a modern ""Christmas Carol"", with the exception that Phil's transformation does not happen overnight.

I thought it was bland and the comedy elements didn't do it for me. But I gave it another watch and my opinion of it has greatly improved. It's a very charming comedy, with an irresistible premise, topped off by a fine performance from Bill Murray. Murray plays Phil Connors, an arrogant, sarcastic weatherman who begrudgingly travels to the town of Punxsutawney in Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day, where the locals gather to watch the unveiling of a hog and to find out if it'll be a long winter or an early spring. Phil is joined by his producer Rita and cameraman Larry. Just before they leave town, a blizzard cuts off the roads and they have to stay in the town another night. The next morning, Phil wakes up to the exact same day again, and when he realises that he is stuck in a loop, possibly condemned to live the same day forever, he starts to make it work for him, by doing crazy things and trying to make Rita fall in love with him. A film with a premise like this has an unlimited pool of ideas and possibilities to play out, which is certainly the appeal, and I think director Harold Ramis and writer Danny Rubin did a good job with what directions they chose Phil to take.",Groundhog Day

Perhaps sometime during the shooting, the director or somebody else may have suspected that it was more than so but much more than a suspicion it was apparently not.It is funny to be sure but below all fun there lies something deadly serious that was not intended but that nevertheless pulls through and leaves the spectator with a sense of awe for every day of life we are given on earth.You could simply state that it is about the limitless possibilities in the single moment or the eternity in a single day and that, if we were allowed to live fully and not as slaves to a murderous few, then a life-span of only 70 or 60 years or even less would be fully sufficient to complete our time on earth.

Directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray, and with an unforgettably clever blend of comedy, drama and romance within the originally developed story; do not judge this movie by its average appearance.Nobody could ever reboot or remake Bill Murray's amazing performance. Audiences will feel quite surprised as they discover that Murray's loveable character is the majority of the reason for Groundhog Day being a classic. Not only does he cleverly bring out our laughter, but we feel for his character and appreciate his certain emotions.Now, who in the universe wouldn't care to mention the well written and portrayed ideas. There's slapstick humour, a surprisingly mild sense of dark humour and just plenty of general jokes. And what's also quite unexpected about Groundhog Day is the romance or love doesn't take over the comedic and dramatic plot. There's a fair lot less romance than you'd expect, or that's probably because the hilarious comedy and the outstanding plot takes over it all.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Groundhog Day
213,FallenEye,"You Got Me Babe, You Lost Me Babe.",6,23 May 2017,"I've come to realize that Groundhog Day is quite the classic for many, so, I decided to watch it, and see for myself what all the fuss is about.Before you judge my review, please consider the rationale. Groundhog Day had 3 major problems. One problem is easy to overcome as a viewer, and perhaps, given that this movie was made over 20 years ago, one could perhaps, forgive it. The 2nd, a little harder to ignore, because it felt an unnecessary issue for the director to allow. The 3rd problem however, is a major one for the viewer to neglect, because Love, is a language much, much, much older, than just 20 years.1. The time logic of the repetition itself. Phil's 3rd Groundhog Day, he skipped the coffee, and was far more hurried, yet, he still met Ned at the exact same point, and was also still late for the report, as if, everybody else was moving relative to his pace. That is just one example. But to be fair, I'd be willing to let it go.2. Why was Phil experiencing repetitiveness? What caused it and when? Was it all about Rita perhaps? It being about Rita is a conclusion/assumption, not an explanation. And if it were in fact about Rita, why did the repetition not begin at the station, where he first seemed to feel something for her? Now one has to wonder, does Punxsutawney have something to do with it? Probably not, but this is not properly explained.3. Forget the first 2 issues, those can be, ignored if one really wants to. the 3rd problem however, cannot. Groundhog Day doesn't have that ""Moment of Reckoning"" for Phil to overcome. As a romance story, that is especially important to never overlook. True love comes from Phil - upon finally experiencing the next day - telling Rita that, his ""versatility"" is nothing but a cheat. Also, he should explain to her that, when it all began, he exploited the situation, and he exploited others, especially women. Without any of that confessed and acknowledged, Rita is in love, effectively, with a fraud. He may have mentioned part of all of that before, but that was during the phenomenon, and thus, she forgot.Now, those 3 issues, put together with Phil NEVER even once, trying to figure out why this is happening to him, and trying other ways besides suicide, like leaving Punxsutawney, to find a fix and doing stupid things without even knowing how long this phenomenon will persist, put together with splattered moments here and there of weariness, Groundhog Day is a fun movie, but, it is not a classic.I really was hoping for a Romance classic, like Jerry Maguire, but... 6/10 it is, it is.",Groundhog Day
214,Jerique,Comedy or Drama?,9,20 February 2011,"Groundhog Day is more than just a classic Bill Murray movie. It pretty much defined the 1990s for me. Harold Ramis is a comedic genius and Murray delivers comedy like no other actor before or after his prime. This is their masterpiece.I've seen Ghostbusters, and I still believe it is inferior to Groundhog Day. I've recently rewatched the film and read over some trivia to find that Murray and Ramis argued over the film's genre of being a comedy or a drama for years. I can't say which one for sure, but I certainly find it funny and it is a drama, for sure.Groundhog follows weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) and his new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and his cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) to Punxsutawney as he covers the groundhog festival. After his first report, Phil wakes up to February 2, again and finds that he is repeating the day over and over.It's beyond genius to make a movie about this. First of all, this is very easy to produce for the costume designer. It's the same clothes all the time! That is an easy cut of costs, and much like Back to the Future, the location remains the same essentially...so the production designer and location scouter needs not as much. It's also very interesting of an idea to actually make a movie about this sort of deja vu phenomenon.I think what makes me like this film most of all, is the amount of change that happens to Phil over the course of the film. This kind of 'hell' can shape a person from an unrelenting, unloving, uncaring, broken, incomplete shell of a man to a warm, kind-hearted, loving and peaceful soul. It's genuinely inspirational while being dramatic, funny, and romantic.There's not much mature themes or scenes that make this too unsuitable for children. But, maybe that's because I was young when I first saw this and I'd already been watching things like Seinfeld, Fraiser, Friends and horror movies like The Shining. It's still one of the greats, for me, and I think it's a classic that no one should miss.",Groundhog Day
215,illbebackreviews,This movie could so easily have been terrible but under right direction it is a classic comedy!,8,9 February 2013,"The premise of Groundhog Day, under wrong direction and execution could be an awful clichéd mess but under right direction as presented in the film, there is so much good and so little bad about this classic comedic 90's movieGroundhog Day is a movie that's premise is so straightforward that it is literally impossible to not understand, at any time, what is going on. A weatherman named Phil falls under a time loop in which he lives 'Groundhog Day' every day of his life under a time loop. The movie is so strong and so fun that in terms of fun comedies, it can match up to movies like Back to the Future. There is just so much to love about this movie, in particular our two main characters, Phil and Rita. Phil is a typical douchebag at the start of the movie who cares about nothing in his life. However, under the continuous fall of the time loop, he turns into a human being and grows a heart and learns about the qualities of humanity. Like I said earlier, under the wrong director, his character could've been an un-relatable and unrealistic mess but here, the character is done to the top standard. The writing and execution in the movie is just fantastic. The acting stands very strong with Bull Murry being a particular reason to why the movie is so good and his character is so believable. The story itself moves along very well never falling astray. The movie is also very focused on tone constantly giving us the comedic and emotional tone. The movie is, despite being a comedy, very sad and moving on many occasions. The idea of a comedy being a very emotional comedy can often be a mess but the film never tries to be too funny nor too emotional, so the tones are balanced out well. Overall, Groundhog Day is a movie that I guarantee any movie lover will love whether it be the story, the jokes, the characters or whatever! Its a great movie and a true comedy classic from the 1990's.",Groundhog Day
216,ArmandoManuelPereira,Still Entertaining After All These Years,8,11 April 2020,"I wondered if I would find Groundhog Day still entertaining after all these years, and was happy to discover that it is.

217,theinaniloquent,"""He's having the day of his life, over and over...""",7,13 May 2012,"I walked in. I had minor tad expectations. This was one of very few peoples favorite film, it had some good potential, and it had Bill Murray in it. How could anything go wrong? I sat down, turned it on, and took a swig at enjoying a mind(less) comedy...I liked it. Groundhog Day has lots of heart, lots of laugh, and lots of sarcastic one-liners from Bill Murray. But as all this seems to come and go, there were some issues with it. The characters were really one-dimensional. Murray's character was set-up to be a jerk and learn a life lesson from repeating a bad day over and over again. The set-up was useless, and it was contrived. The movie was funny, but the jokes seemed to borrow and borrow from other films similar. Maybe it was because I've seen other modern tales ripped-off from this movie, that the jokes seemed not too smart, but good nevertheless. The film came off a little forgettable, as it gives a good moral lesson and then goes elsewhere; meaning comedy. Lots of it seemed a little preachy, the kind that tells you to get off your ass and live life, but it really didn't take away that much. And my last complaint was how it lacked depth. It sends a message, gives us a good laugh, then wraps up. The movie never gives us something to REALLY think about. The message could've been sugarcoated with more thought and process, but the final product wasn't as bad as my expectations thought it would be.So the film was good. Although it was somewhat of a forgettable comedy, with a somewhat preachy moral message, it entertains and provides itself as a yearly tradition, and a good one at that. 7/10.",Groundhog Day
218,dumsumdumfai,What a premise,9,17 June 2009,"The only thing that will make this movie seem dated is the costume and hair styling. Wish they could have made this in a Gataca-like set so it can last forever. (Come to think of it, it might work to the Gataca plot too) Bet no one really sees how good this movie can be/work except the crew and producer. Why it doesn't get more attention I have no idea (only thing I could think of is that the original idea came from another film - I'm fairly pessimistic about Hollywood) Murray is fabulous.

The movie is about a stuck up news reporter who finds himself in his home town reliving Groundhog Day over and over again. This movie is good because it is clever, original and funny or hilarious as I should say. This Bill Murray movie is probably my equal favourite one with him in it to The Man Who Knew too Little. Overall I rate this movie very high for cleverness and all that while being one of the funniest Bill Murray movies out there so I recommend this to anyone and everyone as it is enjoyable and should be(and probably by now is) a major classic so 97%.",Groundhog Day

'Yay'.Second, this movie contains a very interesting concept that I think is really cool. Imagine you have to deal with a certain Holiday or event. But instead of going on to the next day, you end up repeating that same day over again. Only instead of being unaware of it, you show your awareness of it and you end up gaining knowledge and information you didn't know before. Plus you get to start over and over again, so you can be a bad guy in one 'day' and a good guy the next.The only thing I didn't like were the seductive scenes. But you know, it was a lot better than what they show Today.",Groundhog Day
221,brianberta,A fantastic character study,7,7 February 2016,"I was interested in seeing this film because I was curious what they were going to do with its plot. There is a lot you can do with a plot like this and I was interested to know which directions the movie was going to go in. I was very proud of the angle the movie went in. After watching it, I can safely say that it is one of the best comedies from the past 25-30 years.A weatherman finds himself living the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again. He is the only one who seems to know that it is happening. After he adjusts to it, he tries different things such as finding a love interest, meeting new people, doing illegal activities, helping out people, and trying to figure out how to stop it from going on.Instances he encounters on that day which keeps on getting repeated include: meeting a friendly former classmate who is trying to sell him insurance, doing a news report on the event of the ""Groundhog Day"" which he finds to be stupid and pointless, and experiencing a snow blizzard which traps him in a town. He is also very rude to his co-workers: Rita and Larry. He dislikes his job, his colleagues, and himself most of all.However, he learns that in order for the event to stop: he may have to change his normal way of life. Over the course of the days, he discovers his love for Rita and his desire to be with her. He also learns to be more kind to other people and he gets to know and help out people around town that he wouldn't have been introduced to had the events in the film had never have taken place. The event makes him learn to love himself and others. It's a very interesting idea a film could use for representing a change in a characters personality.Another great thing in the film is that it leaves the reason for the day's constant repetition ambiguous. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide why that happened to him. It makes the viewer wonder if there was an entity or something else that was doing this to him in hopes of having him change his life and personality around. I can understand why someone wouldn't like this, but I didn't mind it because it gave the film sort of an alien or other-worldly feel to it. That's not to say that the movie didn't have one to begin with, but the ambiguity increased it.Phil's character development in the movie is very convincing and realistic because we can easily believe that the situation would make him react the way he does. There are dark periods in the film when he endangers his life, does illegal activities, and tries to commit suicide. There are also reckless periods in the film when he tries weird and foolish things he wouldn't normally try. Finally, there are some happy periods in the film when he tries to improve on his life and personality. It makes sense that he would try different things because since he doesn't know anything about the situation: There is no way for him to know how to stop it from happening and whether or not he's supposed to do something. Since he loves Rita, the only way he can impress her is by actually changing instead of faking it. At one point in the movie, Rita says that egocentricity is one of his ""defining characteristics"". He doesn't stop being egocentric at the end. He just learns to use it in a positive direction.One of the other great things about this film is Bill Murray's terrific acting. I can't think of any actor who would've performed the role better than Bill Murray did. He proved to us that he's not only able to show dramatic depth, but he is also able to combine a comedic and serious side all into the same character. I think that his role here is his best performance yet.The only thing I didn't like about it is that I wished it was funnier. Of course, there were only a couple points in the film when it made me laugh. However, even the jokes that I did laugh at weren't super creative or that well-written. However, this is my only complaint for the film and nothing else really bugged me about it.In conclusion, this could've just been a good movie, but the fantastic choice of turning it into a character study makes it something special. His character development was interesting and convincing and it was handled very well in the movie. The feeling of ambiguity and Bill Murray's incredible acting also helped to carry this movie. Even though it was light on comedy, this is still an amazing comedy film which ranks up there with some of the very best of the genre.",Groundhog Day

223,CleveMan66,"It's time to watch ""Groundhog Day""...again.",9,2 February 2015,"Some movies are enjoyed by millions and even critically acclaimed when they are first released, but end up being largely forgotten. Then there are those movies that are so original, so well-done, so reflective of their times, or so impactful on the culture that they never leave our memories. These are the films that seem to constantly hover in the back of our conscious minds, available to be instantly brought to the forefront when we encounter a situation, a phrase or even just a mood that reminds us of the first time we saw it. ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) is such a movie.It made a good profit during its initial run (according to Wikipedia, earning $70.9 million in North America, making it the 13th highest grossing movie of 1993), but the movie has become even better appreciated and loved over the years. It has made many ""Best of"" movie lists and has been preserved by the Library of Congress. Even the legendary critic Roger Ebert, in his ""Great Movies"" essay, according to Wikipedia, wrote that ""he had initially underestimated the film's many virtues and only came to truly appreciate it through repeated viewings."" But the film's impact is even deeper and broader than those facts suggest. Think about it. When people refer to a case of seemingly never-ending repetition, they often refer to it as being ""like groundhog day"". They're not talking about the annual event in Pennsylvania and various other locations around the nation. They're talking about the movie. THAT'S significant impact. When was the last time that YOU checked out this cinematic gem? If it's been awhile, or if you've never seen it, read on.Bill Murray stars as Chuck Connors, a clever, but arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman who is dreading his annual trip to nearby Punxsutawney to cover Groundhog Day, or as he calls it, ""a large rodent predicting the weather."" His new and vivacious producer, Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) does her best to keep him happy and help get the job done, while their cameraman, Larry (Chris Elliott), has learned to just put up with Phil. On his way from his room in a cozy B&B to his on-camera gig, Phil encounters a number of people whom he writes off as ""hicks"", including a friendly hotel guest on the stairs, the proprietor of the B&B, Mrs. Lanchester (Angela Paton), and an old high school classmate named Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) who tries to sell him insurance. After running this gauntlet, he gets to the site just in time, does a brief, sarcastic on-camera commentary and gets ready to get the heck out of Dodge. To Phil's consternation, their van gets turned around on the highway by a blizzard moving in, a blizzard which, ironically, Phil had predicted would miss that area. But a botched weather forecast and an unexpected return to Punxsutawney are only the beginning of Phil's problems.The next morning, Phil wakes up in the same room as the day before, to the same song on the radio, with the disc jockeys saying the same things and meeting the same people in the same places saying the same things as the day before – because it IS the day before! As Phil says in his on camera report, ""It's Groundhog Dayagain."" It soon starts looking like it's going to be February 2nd for the rest of Phil's life. As Phil goes through the cinematic equivalent of purgatory, at first, he's confused, and then he's frustrated. Then he expresses a desire to get stuck in a better day but starts trying to enjoy the consequence-free nature of this one, even to the point of manipulating people (especially Rita, whom he wants to fall for him). Soon, Phil despairs to the point of trying to kill himself and then he resigns himself to what seems to be his fate. It's almost as if he's going through the classic stages of grief – grief over the life he has lost – the kind of life we all take for granted, the ability to wake up tomorrow and actually have it BE tomorrow. ""What if there IS no tomorrow?"" Phil once shouts in frustration. ""There wasn't one today!"" Eventually, after untold numbers of years stuck in the same day (the actual number of re-dos being the topic of much debate), Phil begins using his virtual omniscience for good and becomes a better person for it. (Just in case anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie, I won't spoil it by telling you whether Rita eventually falls for Phil or if he breaks free from his cycle of February 2nds.) The late, great Harold Ramis co-wrote, directed (and briefly appears in) this classic comedy, which is much more than the sum of its parts. The script is sharp and witty, the direction and editing are skilled and the film is perfectly cast. This movie is original, clever and very funny, but is also very meaningful. I won't over-analyze the movie and ruin it for anyone, or deprive you of your own interpretations, but I will say that there is a lot of symbolism in this movie and some lessons on the importance of having unselfish priorities. Now, as long as this retro review is already, I could say more, but I'm writing this on the evening of February 2nd and I'm excited about what that means. It's time to watch ""Groundhog Day""again!",Groundhog Day
224,Ric-7,Neglected Masterpiece,10,21 August 2005,"I thought the film was terrific when I saw it in theaters twelve years ago. Recently in watching it again on cable, I was amazed at the quality of the screenplay. I didn't notice the first time. But on repeated viewings (like reliving Groundhog Day), I was impressed at the story created by the writers. This film is so much more than witty jokes and comic riffs arranged around a gimmick. It has an internal logic and consistency that is very rarely found in screenplays. No joke seemed disposable, and as you laugh your way along, the philosophy underlying the film takes over your imagination.Check the IMDb listings for this film's awards: look at the numerous British awards for writing. And yet this film was not even nominated for an Oscar. It is so rare that a film's jokes seem just as fresh more than a decade later, but I believe that is because the theme underlying the humor will never go out of fashion.The acting was terrific, and I now think this is Bill Murray's best work (though I didn't take it seriously when I first saw the film.) But the screenplay is the one of the finest ever written. I don't know if it's studied in film schools, but it ought to be.* * * * *ON HAROLD RAMIS' DEATH: Ramis told The Associated Press in a 2009 story about the 50th anniversary of Second City.

The plot is also interesting, I mean, what would you do if it was you? You can literally do anything without consequences, which can be a little scary if you think about it.

Unlike Jimmy Stewart's character, however, Bill Murray's (one of my favorite actors of all time-- so, shoot me!) has virtually zero compassion factor at the start.  Through an unknown mechanism, our ""hero"" is forced to relive Groundhog Day over and over until he ""gets it right,"" that moral being in the hands of the filmmakers.

Great fun and loads of laughs, smirks, and ""cool!""'s even after seeing more times that I can count.  When Phil finally starts to ""settle down"" after ""sowing his oats,"" the Capraesque elements start creeping in, until you are swimming in Americana, heroism, and sentimentality.

It is funny that an actress I don't rate very highly plays a major role in 2 of my favourite films (the other being 3W&1F; I also liked green card, but the star of that for me was the delightful conservatory). But imho the greatness of the film hinges on the path Murray's character takes when granted apparent immortality, with desperation followed by exploitation followed by despair and suicide attempts, until he finally gets it!
In the process, I don't know how many times he gets his face slapped by the object of his desires... affection... and eventually genuine love, but enough to give him a permanent disability if not for the daily reset button.

Groundhog day is not your regular romantic comedy, it is on a different level of different, to say the least. Very interesting concept, i think many people have imagined what it could be to live the same day over and over again, erasing all your mistakes.In my opinion, the essence of this film is to show everybody, how to better their own lives, Phil was not happy with his life, so living the Groundhog day over and over again taught him what he really wants and needs. And to achieve what you want, in his case, to be with Rita, you need to improve and grow as a person, find yourself via learning new skills, meeting new people, helping somebody out just for the heck of it.

230,ryan_kuhn,"""Have you ever had déjà-vu?""",8,13 February 2005,"What if you had to live the same day over and over and over again? Would you pick the day you were in Punxsatawney, Pa. to watch a furry animal pop out of a hole to see if winter comes in 6 weeks, or in less time? I've been to Punxsatawney, and I wouldn't want to relive that day over and over again either. Unfortunately for Bill Murray's TV weatherman character Phil Conners, that's exactly what happens in this odd little comedy directed by Harold Ramis. What begins as a comedy about ""big time"" TV people from Pittsburgh covering the February 2nd rite of passage in Western Pennsylvania. The story ultimately revolves around how Conners is an unhappy man and somehow, he's stuck in a time warp that he can't get out of. He tries being nice, he tries be a bastard, he tries driving out of town, he tries stealing the groundhog, he even tries dying. Nothing gets him out of February 2 in Punxsatawney. Among the many groundhog days, he discovers the world, the people around him. He's saddened by the death of a man he passed every morning. He meets a person he knew in high school, and his attitude towards him changes over time, and he realizes the happiness he needs to fulfill his life is right there in front of him. Sure it's cheesy, sure it's predictable, but there's enough Bill Murray humor early in the film and Bill Murray charm in the end of the movie to hold it together. There are some cute scenes where ""one day"" he asks a random woman in a coffee shop what her favorite something is, and the ""next day"" uses that information to score a date. There are little scenes like that through the film that rely on Murray, and the audience, buying into the premise of the film. Andie MacDowell plays Conners' TV producer and Chris Elliott plays his camera man, each has the thankless job of playing characters who have no idea that Conners is reliving each day over and over again. One thing that bothered me was the movie was not shot in Punxsatawney, rather some town in Illinois, and that bothered me a bit, but most people wouldn't know unless they were told. Oh well, at least it wasn't Toronto.",Groundhog Day
231,patryk-czekaj,A movie that you might consider re-watching,7,10 June 2012,"Groundhog Day is a perfect movie to watch during a rainy evening, while sitting on a cozy couch, covered with a warm blanket, and with a bag of popcorn in hand. It's a well-structured comedy offering many laughs, with a decent plot, which doesn't necessarily involve a lot of thinking.Phil (Bill Murray), a tired and self-centered weatherman, goes on a trip to Punxsutawney (fancy name I must say), Pennsylvania, in order to cover a story of the infamous Groundhog Day celebrations that take place there every year. Along with him come an irritated cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and a pretty newbie producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). It seems like it will be just another one-day excursion, just to inform people about another useless festivities that involve a groundhog predicting the coming of spring. However, due to horrible weather conditions the trio has to settle down in the city for another night. And then the strangest thing happens. Phil wakes up to the same radio announcements; sees exactly the same view outside his window; gets the same greetings from a hotel lady. And soon discovers that Groundhog Day is going to take place all over again, and again, and againSo why not take advantage of this bizarre situation? At first, he attempts to live his life to the fullest, letting go of all the greed, selfish desires, and sexual temptations. By spending this one particular day anew he gets to know every single person in this small town, and is able to profit from all the information acquired. He also tries to get closer to Rita but fails miserably. That's phase one.In phase two, Phil realizes (after falling off a cliff in a car) that he became immortal somehow and won't die. So he tries to commit suicide in every possible way and still wakes up at 6 a.m. in the same bed listening to a song by Sonny & Cher. He starts to feel miserable and tired of all the mess that he's in. And then comes phase three. He once again wants to seduce Rita. He gets to know her better day after day, in order to finally be able to sleep with her. However, as convincing as he may be, she still rejects him after all. The ultimate way to make her fall in love with him is through good deeds. After all that time he understands that by being altruistic and helpful towards other people goes a road to a woman's heart.The main quality of the movie is contained in its ability to show mostly the same sequences all over again (well, that's what it's all about), but do it in such a manner that isn't boring or dull. Even though it's the same day, the events, actions, and people that the viewer sees are different or presented in an alternative manner. This is probably one of Bill Murray's funniest roles. I always admired his passion for acting, and in Groundhog Day he is convincing enough to say that he might as well play in joyful comedies, as in respectable dramas. His performance makes the movie much more pleasurable, as we are able to look at the transformation of his character and the gradual changes that he goes through from point A (destroy, burn, steal) to point B (love, care, understand). All in all, I won't say that Groundhog Day is my favorite comedy, but it definitely showed me that even some light-hearted comedies are able to pass a meaningful message to the world, and at the same time, make you laugh at the ridiculousness of their storyline.",Groundhog Day
232,mgruebel,See it again and again...,8,5 January 2015,"After I saw it for the first time, I saw it again... and again... and again. Kind of like Bill Murray's character must have felt in this awesome romantic comedy.We all wish occasionally that we could turn back time to fix our mistakes. Murray, portraying a TV weatherman trapped in a one-day time loop actually gets to do it. At first, he does not realize what good luck he has. Reporting on groundhog's weather prediction capabilities is about on his list where a root canal ranks. He's just that kind of a cynical ass. When he wakes up on the same day over and over again, it seems the gods have punished him. But then he begins to fall for his intelligent and pretty colleague. At first, he woos her with cheap one- liners and tricks that just don't seem to work. Then he starts making life-changing efforts, such as spending months (years?) to study the piano so he can impress her. Still not right, but you now realize how serious he has become, spending years of his life learning something constructive to achieve a goal. After a near-death experience to get out of the loop, he is finally redeemed, and the gods seem more merciful.The movie is great on many levels.

235,lediscipledessocrates,One of those movies ...which could have been much better....,7,8 March 2010,"I shall not try to conceal my disappointment when it comes to this movie. In a way though I knew something like this would would happen. A seriously well thought out plot and some good performances by the cast weren't enough to raise this movie's stature in my eyes to the extent that it be voted among the top 250 movies of all times.All said and done though , I shall commence my analysis.The DirectionA typical early 90's flick and hence had that pseudo feel good vibe around it, found in most light romantic movies of that time. The director could have done much better with the story handed out to him . Some parts were hastily executed were others were rubbed on for too long . The ScreenplayIt was the screenplay which disappointed me the most. The dialogues were sparingly funny. Wit was evidently absent . Many lines were repetitive and proved highly unbecoming for the plot. I mean , none of the actors had show stealers given to them.The ActingBill Murray is a veteran . But that fact does not by itself imply that he is extraordinary . A fine actor with good facial expressions and body language , he surely is. The driving force of the movie , undoubtedly.Andy McDowell does fine as a clichéd yet for some reason attractive leading lady .The support staff is equally decent (not more not less).The StoryGood. Actually great. In that it captures all those finer emotions of a life ; It deals with actual dilemmas and Bill Murray's acting and Make Up actually serve the story well. Most Importantly , only faint references to sex. No Nudity or any overtly sexual scenes , no profanities. Perhaps this is why it is so popular. A clean and neat family movie. Why I gave it 7 .For me the movie is undoubtedly neat and clean ( a relief , after a long time) and that is important. The fact that the movie pulls along at a nice rate and tempo without the use of profanities or explicit scenes (despite being a highly rated comedy movie) is itself commendable.On the whole a decent family flick but according to me could have been better , for the position it occupies in the Top 250 list.",Groundhog Day
236,fredericksmith1952,Groundhog Day is one of those films you either love or hate.,8,20 May 2012,"No in between, no take it or leave it. Everyone has an opinion, and surprisingly they all appear to be valid. I fall on the ""love it"" side of the equation, but I am a huge Bill Murray fan. Everyone knows a Bill Murray, the guy who wants to do something just wrong enough to get him fired and just right enough to be fun. Bill's character in this film is at the stage in his life where he is totally focused on advancing his career, regardless of what happens to those around him, which is why he cannot advance his career. Chris Elliot as Larry the cameraman is resolved to his role in life, observing the lives of others and getting his paycheck at the end of the day. Maybe Chris wanted to try a straight role for once, maybe there was only room for one comedian in the film, but Chris actually contributes little to the film. Andie MacDowell is the naive, wide eyed beginning producer who really doesn't care about her job as much as she cares about her own agenda. Only in her case, she isn't willing to step over or on people to get where she needs to be in life. Personally I like this film because it is an exhaustive study on the transition of a man through circumstance from an ass to a man. Rated PG for a couple of sexual situations and some violence, I'd say the teens would not be offended, but I doubt they will get it. Collectible if you like Murray, or just like an interesting play on Karma.",Groundhog Day

But for some reason Phil keeps repeating this day over and over again.He probably went through this day 30 times throughout the whole movie, which gave me some good laughs.

238,jake-law123,Best Bill Murray performance and one of the best comedies of all time.,8,15 February 2015,"Bill Murray is usually irresistibly charming even if he's playing a huge douche. Nowhere is that more perfect than in here. He's so likable but so unlikable and charming, it's unreal. At his absolute best in this unusual romantic comedy of self change.Phil Conners, (Bill Murray) is a grumpy weather man who travels to Punxsutawney, PA for the annual Groundhog Day, only to be stuck in a time loop, reliving groundhog day over and over again. With nothing to lose, he has as much fun with it as possible, until his attraction to his journalist, (Andie Macdowell) makes him look at his life when he falls in love with her, not being able to change himself for her.It's a different take of romantic comedy where the romance is one sided. It deals with Bill Murray coping with the situation in different ways. He tries suicide, having fun, trying to do good to the point where he's tired of acting good then becoming rotten again. It's such a well set up film with a really fun touch to it. It cleverly plays around with the repetitive nature of the scenes. It can drive some nuts, but seeing him react in different ways every day is super fun.There have been so many philosophies about the time loop in this film: How long does he stay in the loop? what is the perspective of everybody else? What causes it? So many questions near the end, but it's such a clever way to display its message about self change.With that said, Bill Murray is hilarious. He is so care free and sarcastic in this film, it's unreal. He'll go with anything if it feels right. He manipulates women by learning a lot about them overtime, then sleeping with them. It's a film that can go anywhere at anytime. Watching Bill Murray's multiple reactions is just insanely hilarious. Nobody else could have pulled this off. It's simply perfect.Even though It's probably not the best comedy of all time, it's my favorite comedy. It's the perfect blend of stupid, clever, and emotional, and to be centered around one of the funniest people of all time, there's no getting around how excellent and timeless this is.",Groundhog Day

It's heartwarming, it's a classic, what more could I say?",Groundhog Day
243,zenmateisshite,I finally figured it out,8,12 December 2020,"I watched Groundhog Day many times. Bill Murray, Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis are geniuses. Its funny, sometimes sad, optimistic and deeply profound. It is a classic movie.However I never worked out what was the secret to Phil's success; what did he do to break the cycle and finally move on in the end of the movie. Until now.The idea is that Phil after years and years of hard work, self-improvement and embracing change managed to focus his life and form relationships with others through learning many useful skills and achieving his true potential. He became a selfless, decent, mature, giving human being. Right?Well if that is the case then there are a few things wrong with this premise:
1- Most people in the movie are far away from achieving what Phil achieved. Why are they not stuck like he is?2- Yes Phil helped people around town for no selfish reason - he wanted to be good for the joy of it. But all that he did was superficial. He did not really get deep into people's problems, just scratched the surface. Even if he did go deep, why would that automatically make him a happier person? A lot of doctors, psychiatrists, dentists, charity workers and healers help many people, but many of them are miserable. For example, suicide rates among dentists are higher than average. How do you explain that?3- Rita is a nice, warm, optimistic character, but why does it have to be the beautiful young woman driving Phil to change and be a better man? What about Nancy? She seemed nice and did like him also. I didn't see Rita help anyone in the movie, yes she was optimistic and warm but as far as we could tell she doesn't paly any instrument, or sculpt ice and she did not help old ladies fix their flat tiers or the young couple get married. Why is she so special?Groundhog Day is a very nice movie. Well-written story, very good acting, funny and light-hearted with a good message - it is just not meant to be a serious how-to guide to live one's life.",Groundhog Day

245,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Probably my favorite movie of all time,10,29 August 2013,"From the outset, I didn't particularly like the music, the production or any of the cast members, nor did I rate this film anything other than really good fun after first screening, but after many viewings and the passing of years I now rate this film as one of the best, if not THE best, film I have ever seen.Take my final statement with a pinch of salt if you like. It is a subjective opinion.I think the depth of script-writing in this film is amazing. A group of people have sat down and discussed in exact detail how they would feel if they went through a similar cycle of events. What would their initial, gradual and long-term reactions be? What would the underlying core characteristics of a human being be when faced with such a situation: good or bad?The day repeats over and over again, ad infinitum, followed by initial disbelief and shock. Check that. The next emotion is euphoria at realizing that there are ""no consequences"" and as much debauchery can be committed as desired, followed by a more calculated period of manipulation, trying to get exactly what Phil wants (played by Bill Murray), then followed by extreme depression when he finally realizes that the most desired things in his life cannot always be obtained, followed by enlightenment and the understanding of what life really is all about: trying to be the best you possible can.But above all, this is a story about love. A man tries everything in his power to win the person he desires most (Rita, played by Andie MacDowell), but after trying every trick in the book, then realizes that the only way to achieve this goal is to first concentrate on becoming a better person. The rest comes naturally.It's a funny, uplifting, rewarding and enlightening film that's grown to be one of my favorites of all-time and, in the decades to come, when I'm really old, my family will probably complain about that daft film that I like so much, but oh how little they really know.",Groundhog Day

I think it is very good, but not the greatest.The idea of reliving the same day is unusual yet simple.  It does have a philosophical conundrum buried in it, but at heart this is a romantic comedy with a twist.  It is not philosophy sugar-coated as romantic comedy.  In other words, if you want a good philosophical think, read some Bertrand Russell instead.There are some very entertaining scenes - the bowling alley debate and the ""Thelma & Louise""-esque scene with Bill Murray and the groundhog especially coming to mind as ""laugh-out-louders"".If you haven't seen it, then treat yourself to an hour-and-a-half of escapism and laughter, because that's what Groundhog Day is.",Groundhog Day
247,eastbergholt2002,Great Movie,10,20 November 2010,"Groundhog Day is one of my favorite films of the 1990s. It's funny, smart and the story is original. It's an almost perfect movie. Bill Murray is superb as Phil Connors, an arrogant, egocentric and misanthropic TV weather man who receives his comeuppance through getting to re-live the same day over and over again.Every day is the same and only Connor's attitude to those around him changes. Initially he makes the most of the experience. He sleeps with women, drinks and eats too much and steals money. Over time Phil falls in love with his lovely TV producer, Rita played by Andie MacDowell, and decides to win her heart. After her rejection he becomes lonely and depressed. He tries suicide but discovers he is indestructible. During time in captivity he begins to read philosophy and eventually learns to empathize with those around him. Phil has enough time to become a virtuoso pianist and a brilliant ice sculptor. Connors achieves some happiness by doing good and eventually becomes a reformed character. Finally he wins over Rita and is released from the spell.The plot is new but the supernatural elements are a throwback to the films of the 1930s and 1940s. Unlike A Christmas Carol, Phil doesn't have a ghost to explain to him where we went wrong and why he should change. In Groundhog Day he has to figure it out for himself and this takes a long time. The film is not a formulaic Hollywood romantic comedy and the script written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis is clever and funny. The film wouldn't work without a brilliant central performance and Bill Murray was made to play Phil Connors. He starts off as a jerk but gradually you start to like him. The rest of the cast are excellent; the film features a strong team of character actors who often steal scenes from Murray. Harold Ramis does an inspired job as the writer-director. This is a great movie.",Groundhog Day

""Groundhog Day"" ironically qualifies many times over. Bill Murray is just sensational as the ultimate curmudgeon who learns to change because he has to. Andie McDowell is not my favorite actress, but she truly shines in this romantic comedy classic. Now I could nitpick about somethings in the film like, like, ""How the Hell did he learn ice sculpture in such a short time?"" but comedy is the ultimate suspension of disbelief genre, but I still would like to know who did those fabulous cultures, the credit you rarely see you in end credits. Even Chris Elliott who usually annoys me has his moments. heck, I even liked the pairing of Rick Ducommon and Rick Overton (the latter with whom I have had less than warm moments) has two mildly lovable drunks. if you have never seen the movie before, and you like clever and engaging comedies, I can pretty much guarantee that you will fall in love with this movie unless you are as cynical and the earlier Murray character in this classic.

Firstly the concept of being caught in a time loop and secondly Bill Murrays portrayal of the man caught in said loop.In the years since I've always been fascinated by movies and TV shows featuring time loops and time paradoxes. In some cases movies have also used time as a mechanism to drive a psychological or supernatural point rather than a sci fi story and Groundhog Day is such a story.Groundhog Day has no mechanism for time travel, there's no scientific device or porthole or rip in the spacetime continuum. He just lives through the same day over and over. Why?In the end it turns out that the whole reason for him reliving the same day is for him to improve and make himself a better man in order to win the heart of an entitled, self obsessed, sanctimonious, judgemental woman who herself doesn't have to make an iota of self improvement herself.Bill Murray pretty much carries this movie single handedly.

Let me tell you why.Playing a douche is hard and an actor should combine a visual and spiritual quality of a scumbag. Everybody loves Bill Murray, nevertheless he has managed to shake off the air of cuteness and suit up into a sarcastic egocentric jerk. Through a magical set of events we can follow the emotional rollercoaster that this celebrity in the emergency is experiencing. The pressure of unknown reasons and uncharted goals constantly reminds of itself causing unexpected reactions that are hilarious, adorable, heartbreaking, romantic and eye-opening. The number of situations and the versatility of the main character are so huge that they could have easily been split into several movies, but instead artfully crafted into fluent journey of self-discovery and self-rehabilitation.Despite the long winter depicted here I felt cozy warmness all the way through the film and even after the end credits.

260,byson5186,How We Spend Everyday,10,29 September 2014,"I only saw this movie once with my parents on Groundhogs Day, 2013. I didn't even know what the movie was about, not even knowing that the plot would be about a day repeating itself over and over. So, yeah while only seeing this movie one time, the plot is memorable along with the messages from the movie. To me personally, I can't think of any movie that has ever left me with a more positive message than this movie. Most movies will try to leave you with a good life message, but this movie has a very powerful message. Let's think about this movie in perspective trying not to use any spoilers. Well, Groundhog's Day is a holiday and one of the smaller holidays, a holiday most of us probably don't think much about except on February 2nd. It's not like Halloween which is coming up where we're already seeing decorations and costumes out, or Christmas where in 2 months we will see a lot of Christmas decorations along with hearing Christmas music on many radio stations. Groundhog's Day is mostly like a regular day where school doesn't get canceled or anything, and we find out on the news depending on if the Groundhog sees his shadow if we will have an early Spring or 6 more weeks of winter. In this movie, a weatherman known as Phil played by Bill Murray goes with his team to a certain town in Pennsylvania to do a report on the annual Groundhog's Day ceremony. After Phil stays with his team there another night because of a snowstorm, he notices he wakes up not to the next day, but the previous day Groundhog's Day, and the same thing seems to happen over and over and no matter how Phil spends his day, it just seems to continually repeat itself. Nobody else is aware of this time loop and it seems like everything goes the same way with the rest of the community during the day, only Phil can change the events happening by anticipating what is going to happen. So, basically the message this movie has taught me, is how we have everyday a period of 24 hours and we are the ones who decide how to spend the time each day. Most of the things we do each day are probably based on routine and habit, which is a good reason to get into good habits making somethings more natural to us. Obviously, we have countless opportunities of what we can do every single day with our time. Interestingly, we often times look back and are amazed at all the time that has passed from memorable moments, thinking the time flies. However, this movie shows how we spend are time in a single day and what we can do with all those opportunities, doing different things if a day keeps repeating itself, and getting different things from what we choose to do, like Phil chose to learn how to play the piano and get to know the community. So, basically each day is an opportunity in our life to do something, even things we've never done before. I personally am amazed at all we can do in a single day. I thought about that when I ran Cross Country in College, some days we would run 10 miles on scenic routes in the middle of nowhere on a day where we had classes, and a school night. We'd get back in time for dinner and to do homework. It was interesting to see myself in places I'm normally at on vacations in just an afternoon during a Cross Country practice along with getting good exercise and seeing the beautiful world. So, we might not be able to see the end from the beginning like Murray could. But, often times we don't take chances in life and miss out on opportunities we have because we are too afraid and don't try and unlike Phil some of those opportunities we have now, never come back. It's up to us to do what we can as I read earlier today on the internet, ""If You Think Adventure Is Dangerous, Try Routine It's Lethal."" The plot of a time loop has also been a plot in other movies like one more recently with Zachary Gordon, ""Pete's Christmas,"" which wasn't nearly as good as this is. But, we just need to think about how we spend are time and what we do, and we will get results. Some of those results will last a lifetime. I'd give this movie a 10/10. While it's not one of my favorite movies, not like one I'd care to own. I give it a 10/10 because of the positive message it leaves us with.",Groundhog Day
261,Scoopy,The most underrated movie ever made?,10,22 October 1998,"When people assemble their lists of great film comedies, this never appears on the list. It should.It has absolutely everything a great comedy should have.First, it's funny. Bill Murray is the master of comic insincerity and he plays it to the hilt in this movie. He is a weatherman who is to Ground Hog Day as Ebenezer Scrooge is to Christmas. Fate gets fed up with his attitude and forces him to relive that day until he gets it right.Second, it's deep. He doesn't get it right the first time, or perhaps for years. He does what any human would do in the situation. Early on, he uses his knowledge of that day to play God. Then, he uses it to have fun and get women. Then, he is filled with despair and tries to end it with his own death. Then, after trying every crass and immature thing he can think of, he finally realizes that he can actually enjoy his fate if he is reliving a great day, so he makes it so. He makes himself a better person, but the transformation happens only after many missteps ... exactly what would happen to anybody really caught in the situation.How many comedies do you know in which the lead character quotes Chekhov and recites French poetry? Both to good effect (One sincere and touching, the other insincere beyond my ability to describe.)Murray is terrific, as is Andie MacDowell. The supporting players are all spot-on.It's just a terrific comedy. It should have won a whole bunch of awards. Why it did not is a mystery.",Groundhog Day

Bill Murray as Phil Connors had to find this out in one of my favorite comedies of all time.  ""Groundhog Day"" could have been severely repetitive based on being forced to live a day over and over until Connors gets it right. The film goes from Murray's change from a cynical, self-centered weatherman to a suicidal depressive to someone who makes life better for everyone else, including himself.  It's often hilarious, many times heartfelt and sad, touching and ultimately rewarding.  You watch Bill Murray's character go from lust to love over Andie McDowell, and his evolution to not only make himself better for her, but overall.I've seen this film countless times, and it still gets me how thoughtful and well-written this film is.  It's full of great dialogue and some clever sight gags and humor.  It's never too silly or too sappy.Movies like this are rare and not usually pulled off this well that have such a unique premise.  Bill Murray proves that while he's still among one of the funniest people around, he can also pull off a convincing romantic lead.  Definitely worth seeing for those who like comedy/romance films.",Groundhog Day
263,eamon-hennedy,Bill Murray at his best.,10,25 February 2004,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. A wonderful little romantic comedy that is full of quirks, fantastic and zany humor, an eventually touching romantic sub-plot and Bill Murray putting in his best performance in a comedy film (only his recent turn in Lost in Translation is on a par with his performance here), this is as close as romantic comedies come to perfection. While the plot has been done on countless science fiction and fantasy television shows, from The Twilight Zone to The X Files, Star Trek to Buffy The Vampire Slayer, the concept works frequently well and does so here, working brilliantly due to the efforts of Harold Ramis behind the camera and script, alongside Danny Rubin on screenplay duties and the magnificent central performance of Bill Murray as Phil Connors, the egotistical and heartless reporter who, in the grand traditions of Hollywood, becomes a better man due to his predicament. While it is clear early on that this is where the story is going, the journey there is one of the most entertaining and downright funny comedies to be filmed. Phil's journey takes in the the emotional ranges of bewilderment, to confidence in using the time warp to his advantage (getting laid, stealing money from a bank van, trying to move in on his producer Rita (a beautiful Andie McDowell)) to depression that leads to many suicide attempts and eventually to acceptance, where he tries to right the wrongs of the day, from being nicer to Rita and his camera man Larry, to saving lives successfully (Buster, the Groundhog keeper) to sadly the not so successful (the old man in the street). Murray has always cornered the markets of either being sarcastic but lovable (Ghostbusters) to just plain nasty (Scrooged), but here he mixes in many personalities in his performance. How he goes from being sarcastic and nasty to a really nice guy is believably done and marks this out as his finest performance. How he genuinely comes to love Rita would have been hokey and sentimental in the hands of any other director or actor, but in the hands of Ramis and Murray it becomes a touching and life affirming comedy that is well worth repeat viewing. Adding to this wonderful mix is a terrific little music score from George Fenton (genuinely romantic and emotional in some cases), a lovely supporting role for Andie McDowell (who wouldn't fall in love with her after watching this film) and some of the finest comedy scenarios committed to film. Check out Phil reciting the answers on Jeopardy before the question is even asked, the repeated suicide attempts and not forgetting the car chase involving Phil allowing the Groundhog to drive. This is as close to perfection as a film can possibly be and is perfect for repeat viewing.",Groundhog Day
264,Rumples,Very clever movie,8,11 May 1999,"As has already been said several times, this movie is good. It is so good that it manages to be thought-provoking at the same time as it is humourous. Memorable performances from the cast (I'm a bit ambivalent about Andie McDowell) tied with a witty script and clever directing lift this fascinating premise to a very watchable film. So watchable that I and many others feel they could watch this movie again and again (although only on free-to-air ;)Good film, definitely worth a watch. 8/10",Groundhog Day
265,Wilbur-10,Lightweight comedy which becomes patronising and unfunny.,5,12 January 2001,"What should be a winning formula, with Ramis directing and Murray starring, manages to turn into one long drag.Murray plays a cynical TV Weatherman, reporting in a small town on their Groundhog Day celebrations. He finds himself stuck there, reliving the same day over and over again, and therefore able to manipulate the events he knows are coming.If this had remained a straight comedy things may have worked, but the film decides to cloak itself in a social message aura and tries to make some far-reaching preachy comments. What life was in the basic premise soon wears thin and the film drags itself along for the remaining hour or so.The film seems to be universally admired so maybe I'm not enlightened enough to fully appreciate it. It presumably has an element which hits a nerve with a certain audience - with me it didn't just miss the mark, it missed the entire block.",Groundhog Day

Well, now I have and I am glad that I did! Bill Murray's performance is as excellent as you would expect  wry, cynical, charming and, obviously, funny. Andie Macdowell is not horribly annoying in a break from the norm and the concept is attractive and well delivered. My only gripe is that Ned Ryerson needs his own film! What a genius character! I was praying for Murray to knock him out from the first moment he spoke. He's a spectacular comedic creation and really needs his own film, or maybe a spin-off TV show Anyway, good film, go buy.",Groundhog Day
267,jhsteel,One of the very best,9,2 February 2011,"I watch this film every year, on 2nd February if I remember, in homage to the concept of life repeating itself. Others have paid tribute to the wonderful performances of Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, but everything that happens is worth watching over and over again. It never becomes stale because there is some basic existential truth in Groundhog Day. It's also a puzzle that is never solved.Recently, I heard on a TV documentary (I can't remember what it was about) that 2nd February is Candlemas, an ancient festival linked to folk tradition as well as a religious festival. Traditionally, on this date, animals which hibernate such as bears and wolves will come out and inspect the weather. If they see fine weather, they anticipate that harsh winter weather will continue for another 40 days, and they return to their hibernation. I feel that the choice of Groundhog Day as the day on which Phil experiences being trapped in the winter world of Punxsatawney is meaningful for this reason as well as what happens to the main character.Overall, it's a very hopeful story, with a wonderful ending, and I will never grow tired of watching it every year.For everyone except Phil, that day is a brand new 24 hours, and everything happens once. Phil experiences the day repeatedly, so he can learn something each time. The others meet him anew, or on Rita's case, have only 1 day to get to know him better. Still, by the end he has learnt how to maximise the impact of his interactions because he only has that day in which to do it. Another thing that occurred to me recently is poignant: his Bed and Breakfast establishment is homely but doesn't have hot showers! The day on which Phil is stuck is one on which he must take a cold shower - every day. That's purgatory, by my reckoning.Update: I watch this film every year on 2nd February, or as close as possible. This year I was impressed again by Bill Murray's wonderful performance, the cheerfulness of all the characters and the life-affirming message of the film. I was also surprised when I awoke on 3rd February to see that it had snowed overnight (in London, UK), and therefore I think the weather was telling me that it was indeed the day after Groundhog Day!",Groundhog Day
268,parhat,THE MOVIE on How to Date a Woman and a lot of other things,10,17 April 2006,"This movie is a rare gem. When the movie was first out, no one knew about it. It didn't make a huge fanfare and the Groundhog Day movie never did make it in the IMDb top 250 movies, at least in the beginning.Why this movie is one of my favorite comedy of them all? For one thing, you can watch the movie over and over again and still enjoy it. The making of a classic is it has many elements put into the movie, much like Casablanca, but this is more like Casablanca comedy. What elements does this movie had. It was perhaps the first movie that introduced Groundhog Day originates in Punxsutawney, PA and it is done every year. For Phil it is his fifth time. The second part of the movie is its unique comedy. For those who likes time travel movie - like me (e.g.Timecops,Time Machine, etc.), or those who want to know the future this is THE movie. The third element is a very good question and one that has already effected me as I am actually living in this kind of life (not rich): What would you do if you live in eternity? Would you complain, enjoy, or grow. Phil has been through all the human emotions he can enjoy, from irritation, surprise, being ""God"", care little about the future, hate, taking advantage of the future, to finally maturing and growing.The best part of this movie is: This is THE MOVIE on how to date a woman! Really! One of my past time is to read for fun (but not really do it) a great many articles on picking up a woman, using NLP (Neural Linguistic Programming), and other tricks.To summarize in a nutshell how to date a woman is not to view a woman as a GAME (or a prey), or make a Woman your Prize, or try to please her too much. A woman can spot a man's sense of insecurity and weaknesses in a mile! You can use all the tricks of NLP or in simple language, using the right keywords and other robotic movies and she can tell. Evolution of a woman over a man on this area is something a man will always loses. It is best not to try to be something you are not.This movie also tells you of the most common mistakes a man can make with dating a women. The way to date a woman or get a woman to like you is to make you HER PRIZE. And this is clearly shown in the movie. By making everyone like you through all the things you do, develop your skills, get other woman to want you, and she will want you. This theory in dating is the key to success and it is one of the few movie where a totally retarded man (like me) on dating can really learn this movie if one has any understand of what is going on in the movie. It is just more than getting a woman it is the development of a man's own identity and what he does.This movie basic premise is to relive your life over and over again, what would you do if given that chance, variety of emotions in the movie, and the meaning of life, romance and everything all in one. What more could you ask? Repeat viewing of this movie gets better and better. It is the best comedy movie I ever seen. In my opinion, the IMDb ranking deserves to be higher than #179 and it is only recent that this has even made it to the top 250. It should go higher still if people realize the hidden messages of the movie: should you be a cynic or should you view life positively. The screenwriter did not realized they have just wrote a masterpiece. The comedy and everything are unique only to this movie and it is well worth the watch! You won't be bored.",Groundhog Day

270,RARubin,Groundhog Is Jesus,10,7 April 2005,"Groundhog Day was a Harold Ramis-Danny Green script that Ramis ingeniously shot in a freezing Woodstock, IL for a 1993 release. All the film critics at the time noted it as a cute romantic comedy with no particular accomplishment. Everyone I know who has seen it, myself included, liked it and smiled on their way out of the theater. Groundhog Day is on the American calendar, and the film is often played on that day in mid-winter where those of us in colder climates are dreaming of Spring. Today Groundhog Day is considered one of the great American Films of the late 20th Century. Danny Rubin created the concept while Harold Ramis, co-writer of Animal House and Caddyshack broke away from his previous gross-comedy productions to direct his Opus Maximus. That's how Jonah Goldberg of the National Review described it in the February 2005 issue of the Conservative magazine.I read the 2003 New Yorker piece about Ramis. He's Chicago born Jew with no religious training. He is a Hollywood director, actor, and comedy scriptwriter presently studying Buddhism with his second wife. I don't know anything about Danny Rubin other than his version of the script had Andi MacDowell also reliving Groundhog Day along with Murray's Phil, the slimy weatherman for a Pittsburgh TV station. Ramis made the necessary changes and the rest is possibly the greatest non-secular religious experience in American Cinema. The fact that Rabbi's, Ministers, and Priests are showing this film to their parishioners all over the world is a testament to the film's masterful Aristotelian philosophy of redemption and rebirth.There are so many classic comedy bits, lines to remember, and moments of hilarity for a short review but often overlooked is the theme of rescue through learning. Adults are cursed to make the same mistakes over and over again. Every Freudian shrink has heard his patient's repetition of behavior. Every man is trapped by his wiring. Then, sometimes, maybe because of a catastrophic event, a religious insight, or an intelligent evaluation, there is an epiphany. We can't be sure how the application of intelligence, talent, or luck can establish great work, but we must appreciate it when we see it and be the Groundhog.",Groundhog Day
271,DVR_Brale,Atmospheric to the max!,9,10 February 2017,"I've always appreciated and valued atmosphere in movies, video games, music or you name it over other elements. Those elements certainly contribute to overall impression but without glue, which is atmosphere, can't make a good movie only by themselves.Imagine a charming, snowy little city crowded with charming people. Add three main protagonists with different characters. Spice it up with romance elements and direct the whole thing into delivering a strong existential message in a funny and entertaining way. There you have it: Groundhog Day.The main reason why I liked this movie so much is because it brilliantly balances between being serious and amusing. It can make you think about most pertinent questions to us in general as well as more private ones; it can make you giggle. It's not as if some scenes are funny while other dead serious. Writers of this masterpiece where somehow able to make every scene contain both sides. It's as if you were laughing and thinking about the matter at the same time.Let me finish with a philosophical thought. One who is able to sanctify even the worse can fully enjoy the best.

272,d_art,groundhog has his day....many days,10,5 February 2004,"There are those films after you watch for about 10 or 15 minutes or so, and you realize you are watching something very special and original.  Then, you hope the rest of the movie will equally be as good, if not better, and go beyond your expectations.  Those are times when you see a movie do something very original, and when it succeeds, it's sort of like discovering a diamond in a haystack, or that secret passage behind a bookcase, you basically have no idea what's going to happen next.  It's almost Hitchcockian.  It's a comedy, though.  I had the same kind of thought as I was watching movies like ""Memento"" or ""Dark City.""  It's one of those rare gems you don't see often.The idea itself is pretty straightforward.  It's Groundhog Day, and Phil, a self-absorbed newscaster, one day arrives in Pennsylvania for his gig (a place he'd rather not be), and somehow winds up so that he must repeat that same day (literally) over and over again.  As Apollo in Rocky III would say, ""There is no tomorrow.""  Literally. It's basically like time traveling to the same morning right when the day ends.  (Or, to the techno-geeks out there, I suppose it's almost like an 80's text adventure game where you start over after you mess up or die in the game...but much better)This is basically, in my opinion, Bill Murray's best role thus far (To note, I personally thought ""Lost in Translation"" was one of the most sleep-inducing movies I've seen -- Wong Kar Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" was similar in that ""subtle-ness"" but much better).  As Phil, played excellently by Murray, repeats the same day (Groundhog Day) day after day, he starts to loathe it, then he tries to take advantage of it, using his knowledge to woo women, tries to rob a bank, then not finding fulfillment, starts to loathe his life, and even attempts suicide (to which he wakes up to the same morning he just had).  I must add, whenever I hear the ""I got you, Babe"" song, I am reminded of this movie (a song that repeatedly plays in this movie).  There's something very ""groundhoggy"" about that music.  What I also like about a film like this is that a character eventually goes through change--he doesn't stay the exact same person as he was.  Phil, for example, eventually learns that he must change inward--obviously, changes he makes outside has no effect to anybody else since it'll be the same day tomorrow. Thus, he uses the time to acquire knowledge, becoming more well-rounded, even become a more loving person (perhaps from that inward change).  In observing, I can say it's amazing what one can do in one day, if one lived one's life to the fullest.   The movie indeed is very funny, if it sounded as if the movie wouldn't be funny.  A lot of that credit can be attributed to the actor, the perfect-for-this-role Bill Murray (especially how he reacts to the situations--at one point he punches a guy he knows he will meet again, yet not know it), the clever writers, and smart direction from Harold ""Egon"" Ramis (who also makes a cameo as a doctor).   An excellent film.   Yes, it is kind of like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" if in a more comedic sense.    A smart, very funny movie.  A keeper. 10/10",Groundhog Day

This movie revolves around the weather reporter Phil who visits Punxsutawney to report about the Groundhog Day with which he is least interested, after his first day in that place he plans to get back but due to weather impediment he has to stay back in that place and from here the film gets its twist and the flow of curiosity where Phil get stuck with the Groundhog Day again and again, such an exciting plot surely never disappoints its viewers.Some catchy phrases from the movie like ''what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today'' this actually gained my attention, the scene where Phil helps the beggar to make him feel good in his last days of living was portrayed so emotionally that turns to be the enlightening once, overall this movie is best of its kind, Bill Murray and Andie performed the best, movie has a good grip in its full flow and never creates the confusion.",Groundhog Day

At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage.I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy.Yeah. I liked it.There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is – if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades.But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy.I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that.

280,zensixties,Cheap laughs and over-sentimentality wrapped up in an interesting concept,4,13 April 2005,"Some of the more profound implications of the scenario were unfortunately scrapped to play to a mainstream audience. Though in the surface a good vehicle for Bill Murray, the cons outweigh the pros.There is at least one implication of the scenario overlooked by almost everyone: namely if Bill Murray lives the same day over and over then what happens to everyone else in the world? The only possible solution to this, considering no one else is living it over and over (that we know of), is the many worlds theory. So each new twist of the day creates a new scenario that of course gets played out in the universe that the film's Phil doesn't get to see. So when Phil commits suicide, he really DOES die in that alternate world. And each Phil goes onto the next day with everyone else in the world. So what's happening obviously is his MEMORIES of reliving the same day with different scenarios keep building up more and more.So how do these memories get transmuted back to him each 6AM on February 2nd? The original script explained it as a former girlfriend casting a spell on him. In reincarnation theory what dies isn't consciousness, but memory, and some anecdotes exist of those who recall past lives. So what could account for Phil? Somehow the spell would have to stop the death of memory so he not only keeps remembering the future 24 hours, but remembers all the OTHER future 24 hours. The writer estimated 10 years worth, though the original script called for 10,000 years worth of Feb. 2s, which as you can imagine would make this that much more hellish. The fact that Phil starts out each day the same physically shows that the only thing caught in the time loop is his memory.Now, much of the dialogue is strictly cheap laughs (""ever had Deja Vu?"" ""I'll see if it's on the menu"" and such). But as far as any overall message it gets lost in over-sentimentality, especially at the end. The message is suppose to be that we must keep repeating things until we get them right; problem is the way Phil chooses to get things right is to YES, use tricks to get what he wants, which is Rita (Andie MacDowell).The first night he gets her home she is wise to him, but the last he so utilizes the tricks as to impress her beyond belief. Remember that close to t helast night he tells her the truth of how he knows so much, but NOT the last ""perfect"" day. On THAT day he basically lies to her by impressing her WITHOUT telling her the reason he is able to do so. So actually the film's moral reads: become a master of deceit to get what you want.If the film took the more profound path instead of playing to the mainstream it would have been a great film.

285,alecwest,What a delightful rendering of Hindu philosophy!,10,4 February 2006,"In Hindu philosophy, reincarnation supposes that life is a cycle of birth, death, and re-birth ... which continues over and over until the soul finally reaches the state known as Nirvana. In theory, the soul attempts to improve upon itself with each re-birth ... and eventually becomes an ""old soul"" (many reincarnations) just before Nirvana is attained.In the case of this movie, the cycle is confined to a single day. And the improvements Phil Connors (Bill Murray) makes with each cycle are slow but sure. He transforms himself from being self-centered and egotistical to being life-centered and compassionate. Quite a transformation for a single day ... but it helped that he could repeat the day until he got it right. And during the time between his challenges to this cycle and the time he ""accepts"" the cycle as his lot in life, the transformation occurs.By the way, here's a trivial tidbit with a little mystery. In ""Groundhog Day,"" one of Connors' first encounters is with a character called Ned Ryerson - someone who grew up and went to school with Connors (but that Connors has forgotten about). Bill Murray was a good friend and colleague of comedian, John Belushi. When John died, he was buried in a Martha's Vineyard graveyard (Massachusetts). Murray has been to the gravesite ... and, the grave next to Belushi has a tombstone for its occupant -- Ned Ryerson.Screenplay writer, Danny Rubin, swears he didn't know this ... that he just ""thought up the name,"" thinking that another actor, Ned Beatty, would be ideal for the role. He's never been to the gravesite, either. Perhaps Rubin did just ""think up"" the name as he says and it's just a cosmic coincidence. Or perhaps, he was able to tap into Murray's stream of consciousness (another Hindu possibility) and took the name Ned Ryerson from that stream. I guess we'll never know.",Groundhog Day

Not many films fall into any of these categories for me - let alone all three.I guess the piano lessons was my favourite moment - but the 'deja vu' joke was right up there too. (Even though I'd thought I'd heard it before.....). Ok - so not the deepest movie you will ever see - but it has it's darker side.  Just one question in fact.  How does someone with such a bad complexion make it to be romantic lead opposite Andie Macdowell?",Groundhog Day
291,m0rphy,Today is Yesterday's Tomorrow,8,7 November 2003,"Before putting electronic pen to electronic paper, I carefully read through all other users' comments which are predominately highly favourable. I too must add my paen of praise.This is one of the funniest and most original of Hollywood films and a tour de force for Bill Murray - the perfect actor for the principal role of the tv weather man.The ""Ghostbusters"" connection works well with a very humourous and thought provoking script directed by Harold Ramis.The plot and main philosophical sentiments have aleady been adequately aired below, especially by our friend resident in China.All I will add is, ""Amor Vincit Omnia"".This film will appeal to succeeding generations as the truths and theme of the film are universal and timeless.As I had a sudden urge to see this film one evening, I had to e-mail my son at Bristol University to ascertain its whereabouts in the house (as he is an avid collector of dvds and I am useless at looking for things).I had previously looked at the evening paper on the way home and I could see ""nothing on"" worth viewing on the multifarious terrestial and digital channels to which we subscribe.Bill Murray's dead-pan humour and sense of the ridiculous really appeals to me, especially the touch of irony that he imbues into his roles.I especially laughed when the cops stopped the car he has been driving with the two deadbeats and casually asks the officer for flapjacks while he is being booked for dangerous driving.Perhaps we can ""forgive"" the scriptwiters for a predicatable happy ending because we all want to feel good at its conclusion.Music is something I especially pay attention to when viewing films and we have an admirable selection here which enhances the action in the major scenes, from classical - Variations on a theme by Paganini (I also detected Mozart), to contemporary jazz, to ""pop"", which will appeal to most musical tastes.The mark of a good comedy should be, did it genuinely make you make you laugh? Most certainly It did.For another example of Bill Murray playing the ""miserable old git"" see ""Scrooged"",  another heartwarming Christmas piece about redemption of the spirit (with aplogies to Charles Dickens).",Groundhog Day
292,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: 'Groundhog Day',8,3 February 2015,"""Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today."" Bill Murray gives probably his best and warm-hearted performances of his career in this 1993 American fantasy comedy as a grumpy weatherman caught in a time loop where everyday is the titular holiday. But will the misanthropic meteorologist eventually discover redemption through caring about the people around him during this monotonous sojourn? Let's take a look. Murray plays the wry, wisecracking weatherman Phil Connors of whom, begrudgingly, goes to the small friendly district of Punxsutawney, PA to attend/report the yearly Groundhog Day festivities. Traveling with him is news producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and smart-aleck cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) to capture the event with him. On the road back to Pittsburgh, a blizzard shuts down all road travel, and the team is forced to return to Punxsutawney and stay another night. Upon awakening the next morning, he discovers that he is reliving February 2 all over again, the day playing out exactly as it had done before on the worst day of his life, with no one but Phil aware of the loop. At first he is confused, but, when the phenomenon continues on subsequent days (isn't Sonny and Cher's 'I Got You Babe' on the clock radio alarm a bit ironic?), he decides to take advantage of the situation with no fear or regrets of long-term consequences. He seduces women, drives recklessly, indulges in hedonism, is constantly confronted by annoying insurance salesman Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) and commits numerous acts of suicide. But Phil gets his own mental wake-up call when it eventually hits him that the only way out is to re-examine his own life and to explore on his own sojourn the positive outlook of living with a purpose and to become less of a self-centered individual and to become more of a caring person, eventually winning the heart of Rita and the respect of the locals as well...despite having Phil discover this over and over (and over) again to hilarious effect. After all was said and done, Phil ""awoke"" from his slumber of egocentricity to a new redemption and another shot at living anew.Written and directed by by Harold Ramis (with a cameo as a neurologist) and Danny Rubin, 'Groundhog Day' remained truly one of the top comedies of the 90's and still, twenty plus years later, manages to make us laugh, allows us to think and, rather than going through the daily motions like a broken record, to live with a sense of purpose while having others in mind for the long run as well. Fresh, original and often times hysterical, please take the time to partake in the festivities with the celebratory plucky prognosticator marmot, the world-famous hirsute weatherman...critter...by checking out this funny and farcical flick where comedy is rarely this perfect. And there's six more weeks of winter. Just saying.",Groundhog Day
293,MinorityReporter,Absolutely Wonderful!,9,13 October 2005,"This (along with Lost in Translation) is my favorite Bill Murray movie. It has everything needed to make it a classic movie. It has a highly innovative story, excellent acting and something else which cannot be described but you feel it.Bill Murray stars in this film which in essence is a film about a man who relives the same day over and over and over. If you can get past the fact that this is impossible you are in for a hell of a movie treat. As I see it the storyline is perfect for character development and great gags. Without saying too much I can say that the main character, who is the only one who can actually remember the day before, plays on this and seduces women. The writer originally wanted the audience to join the main character as he had already been trapped in this time loop for many years (he doesn't age, how can he when the day before never happened?) and he knows everything about everyone. This approach was thankfully abandoned because watching Bill Murray react to his predicament is nothing short of priceless. He is initially intrigued by the concept and abuses his situation but eventually there is a change in the character. What changes I will leave to future viewers to find out for themselves. The film graces a few philosophical questions but nothing more than that because the objective of the film is entertainment and it succeeds brilliantly in its goals.The cast is stellar. Bill Murray, one of our time's greatest actors both comedy wise and dramatically, does an excellent job. His comic timing is flawless and his underplayed and sometimes quite dark humor works brilliantly on screen. Also he portrays the changes in his character with great skill. Pure movie magic. Andie MacDowell, who in my opinion is a very underrated actress, does a great job as well. She is instantly likable and the audience relates to her character immediately because of this. Her reactions are highly believable and this of course adds to the overall credibility of the film. Chris Elliot gracefully underacts his part which is a good thing because the emphasis is on Murray's character but he serves his purpose to great effect. Stephen Tobolowsky steals every scene he is in and contrary to Chris Elliot he overacts every scene he is in but he stays within the confines of believable so his character too works magnificently and creates a lot of laughs. Other than the actors mentioned the supporting cast is excellent. What few scenes Brian Doyle-Murray, Bill Murray's brother, is in he makes his own.Overall the film's cinematography and sets work pretty well but as the emphasis is on the characters its not really worth mentioning aside from what I've just said. The music is another thing which is very good. The score by George Fenton is excellent and fresh. It doesn't sound like something we've heard before and therefore adds to the originality of the film which is already substantial.The whole concept of the film might sound a bit pretentious but it doesn't feel that way. In fact it feels very down to earth because of the characters' believable reactions and seemingly genuine emotions.All in all an excellent, highly original comedy that is definitely worth a look.9/10",Groundhog Day
294,iamyuno2,One Of The Great Romantic Comedies Of All Time,10,28 December 2013,"With an exceptionally unique concept propelling a compelling and consistently entertaining and funny story, the script by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis would stand up well against any of the great romantic comedies of the 1930s. And Bill Murray - not your usual choice in a romantic comedy - is bursting with comic genius and energy in this film. It's one of his very best - and it's Andie MacDowell's very best. She surprises and delights in a natural and endearing performance as the girl-next-door beauty-type, Murray's romantic interest. This is one of those films that is so deep and satisfying on so many levels that you never get tired of seeing it - year after year. And if you ever hear ""I Got You (Babe)"" by Sonny and Cher and DON'T think of this film...then you haven't seen it.",Groundhog Day
295,FilmCreature,FilmCreature Reviews 'Groundhog Day',10,10 August 2007,"I love Groundhog Day. I'm glad I just saw it recently, now that I'm older I enjoy it so much more. I liked GD the first time I saw it as a kid, then I saw it as a teen, and absolutely loved it. I immediately purchased it from GameStop, and have watched it at least ten times since then.Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are both fantastic. Murray plays the lead role of Phil Connors, a prima donna weatherman who fancies himself quite the celebrity. He's doing his hated annual report on the Groundhog Day celebration in Punxatawney, Pennsylvania. Phil goes to bed and wakes up on Groundhog Day. He does the report, and then while trying to leave Punxatawney, he and his crew get stuck in a blizzard. They are forced to go back to Punxatawney.So that they do, and Phil goes to sleep in his nice, warm bed... And when he wakes up the next day, it's GROUNDHOG DAY! Again. He finds it all a little weird.Then he wakes up the next day...And the next day...And the next day...Only to find that it is Groundhog Day again and again. Phil desperately tries to find a solution to this conundrum of his, all while trying to win the heart of the beautiful Rita (MacDowell).This is a fantastic comedy classic directed by Harold Ramis (who has a cameo--he's the brain doctor). Overall, this movie is awesome, and can be enjoyed again and again with the whole family.4/4",Groundhog Day

Can't believe it took me this long to see it. Easily Bill Murray's best performance and the film is soooooooooo much better than the overrated GHOSTBUSTERS or CADDYSHACK or SCROOGED. Forget about it!! Great film with a genius story - about the same day repeating over and over. Yet the story doesn't bog down or become repetitive as the days begin repeating. Just the opposite. It becomes more and more engrossing. And how about that Stephen Tobolowsky as NED... NED RYARSON!!!! BING!!! I SURE AS HECKFIRE REMEMBER YOU!!! BING!! Hahaha! Truly a great comedy of 1993 - just a peg below MRS. DOUBTFIRE and HOT SHOTS PART DEUX.",Groundhog Day
297,treadwaywrites,This Movie Is Funny Over and Over Again,8,3 February 2009,"When you ask someone to think of a Bill Murray movie, Groundhog Day is usually the answer they give. The other half will say Ghostbusters. This is the kind of a role that one is born to play. Murray plays the character of Phil Conners and does it better than a real Phil Conners would have. His comedic talents are highly honed in this performance and he is working near the top of his game. It is so important to be inside a Phil Conner's head in this movie due to the repetitive nature of the movie. Murray is consistent, funny and just melds with the story line.The story line is pretty basic. Phil Conners is a weatherman on assignment to cover Groundhog Day. He doesn't seem to be a nice man nor does he like his job very much. He mis-predicts the weather and end up getting stuck in Puncsutawney, PA where an annual Groundhog Day event is held putting the whole town on hold. Upon awakening the next morning in Puncsutawney the following day he discovers that it is Groundhog Day all over again. There is a great scene when Murray dresses as a cowboy with a date that is classic; and the way he is able to handle the Brink's guards is also very humorous.Also fun to watch in the movie is the talented Andie MacDowell whose character of Rita is completely unaware that it is the same day for Phil. She tries to understand. Less understanding is Phil's cameraman played by David Letterman funny man Chris Elliot who gives his usual spot on dufus performance. The man who will always be synonymous with the film is Stephen Tobolowsky who plays the knee-slapping funny Ned Ryerson. The scenes, few as they are, with Bill Murray are comedy at its finest and also very Bill Murray. Written by Danny Rubin and directed by Harold Ramis (Murray's co-star in Ghostbusters), this film was almost an experiment to see if Hollywood would let them make a movie in which the characters relive the same day over and over again. There have even been analysis papers written about time travel and how Phill Conners reacts in his environment so as to allow the same actions to take place again the next day. The film really found a cult like following when the replay rights were purchased by Turner Broadcasting and the movie received so much repeat airplay on TBS that some viewers thought they were in the actual movie. Ramis is to be commended for keeping all the scenes and continuity straight even with so many Hollywood tricks he could have chosen to use. This movie has turned out to be an important film of the 1990s. 8/10** The poster for the film is a little too cutesy and I never thought of this film as cutesy or talking down to the audience. Of course what does it is the addition of MacDowell on the poster. It must have been in her contract.",Groundhog Day
298,pro_crustes,"Funny, full of heart, but lacks the ending you need.",8,13 September 2001,"The other comments on this film are, collectively, pretty accurate, I think. Murray plays the role of the witty cynic, who lives the same boring day repeatedly, with charm and a credible mix of belief and disbelief.  He was the perfect choice for a part that was probably harder to play than he makes it look.  The writing is as good as the acting (almost; see below), moving quickly past the phase where Murray's character comes to terms with what's happening to him (a smart move, since the viewer already knows, and would be bored if it took long on the screen), and on to exploring the various things we might all think of eventually, if caught in the same sort of Twilight-Zonish phenomenon.  The results of the ""hero's"" efforts to cope with his problem are satisfying, as is his personal evolution, brought on by the experience of trying.  Only the end, which satisfies the heart, but not the brain, fails to equal the rest of the movie.  You never really learn why or how this extraordinary occurrence came to be.  The film is a fable, or fairy-tale, yet its events are so logically presented, and Murray's ways of dealing with and, finally, gaining by them so grounded in reason that the absence of any explanation leaves a hole in the story and, ultimately, your experience in seeing the film.  This would be a four-star movie, if only they'd filled that gap.",Groundhog Day

300,eragonbookfan,Best movie ever. Am I right? Or am I right? ﻿;-),9,27 June 2014,"EVER SINCE I first saw this film, that quote has never left my mind!HOW DID I never hear of this movie....?I'm a regular foreign guy in my 20's from Japan, born and raised; I'm not American, but have a background of British English, French, Swiss-German, and Japanese. And I'm *especially* interested in joining the acting/modeling business. HOW DID I MISS OUT ON THIS FILM MY WHOLE LIFE??? Groundhog Day should take ""Inception""'s place, much higher on the IMDb's Top 250!People are saying ""the Godfather"" or ""Shawshank Redemption"" are the ""best movies ever""??? They're wrong. It's Groundhog Day! Unlike those overrated films which seem to encourage HORRIFIC behavior, this film encourages GOOD behavior - that's a big factor as to why I like it. It's especially a much better flick than ""Inception"" because that's a film I pretty much didn't like because of it's confusing story and *unlikable* characters.And this movie had a way more entertaining, original, interesting, & much better romantic love story than overrated 'Titanic' per say, or even MOST Hollywood films that get produced! Certainly one of the most underrated films I've seen too. But it's RIGHT UP THERE with the awesome-ness of both 'STAR WARS' and 'LORD OF THE RINGS' - not joking!It looks as if Hollywood has such a narrow-minded fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, sexual immorality, etc. (you name it); but don't get me wrong, there's some in this film too, but it's used to a limited medium where it's generally quite subtle, and film is still an engaging, relatable, and even family-friendly!I can't BELIEVE this film wasn't a part of my childhood! I wish at some time at least a friend or *somebody* had told me about or recommended this to me sooner! I will admit, I currently envy those who grew up watching this film at an earlier age. I really wish that ""nostalgia factor"" for this film was there for me too, like I had with the Disney films. YES! I'm going so far as to saying that. It would've been a lot more life-changing! Don't get me wrong. I watched this film (via iPod Touch) and was *amazed* by the simple story-telling, the amazing idea, and just the immense relatability. I noticed MUCH great spiritual elements in this flick too, like redemption and rebirth - seeing & understanding why many pastors, preachers, rabbis (even occult Buddhists) have expressed their admonition for this great piece of work. This is one GENIUS movie! No matter who you are, where you come from, what your thoughts are, or who you know, this is a film that will grab your attention, regardless!Everything about the direction, the acting, the story, the idea, the comedy, and character study was just mind-bogglingly amazing!! In the end, it's all kudos and congrats to the genius Jewish mind of Harold Ramis making a flick suitable for the whole general audience, IMO. I have a real soft spot for Jewish people, 'cause I think everything about their history, their people group, their identity, their heritage is all so magnificently special! They have been WAY TOO persecuted throughout history (ie. Hitler), and it's about time they had some friends! A lot of them have turned out to be incredibly smart & intelligent people throughout out history as well! And I'm a huge supporter of Israel.But back to the subject, I'm VERY astonished to this day as to why this movie totally missed by the Academy and never won ANY Oscars, or at the very least any nominations... So ridiculous. *I* would've given it apparently 5 Oscars! One for Best Director (Harold Ramis), Best Original Screenplay (Danny Rubin), Best Cinematography (John Bailey), Best Actor (Bill Murray), and Best Actress (Andie McDowell)!This may be the ONLY Bill Murray film I really, really like! Though I'm not a big fan of Bill Murray, nor any of the films he's previously done - whether it be Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, Lost In Translation, Scrooged - a bunch of which I never did laugh at nor did find the least bit entertaining, but just found stupid.But actress Andie McDowell is the one who really drew my attention to this film. Seeing the pretty dumb flick ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (which was even nominated for ""Best Picture"" - lol wut?) with Hugh Grant. But it was SHE who caught my attention, 'cause I remember seeing her cameo in ""Muppets From Space"" (lol); and I saw on IMDb she was mostly recognized for this film ""Groundhog Day"", and it's very high rating really caught my attention...so then I decided to check it out.This movie DESERVES to be in the very high-rated spot it currently is (though I think it should be *much higher* on the Top 250 on IMDb - I think it should switch places with ""Fight Club"" or ""Inception"" - which are ALSO some movies I don't really like).And I thought it was smart why this movie doesn't address WHY Phil keeps waking up to the same day - no explanation, no reason, no exposition - it just HAPPENS... and there's no problem going along with it! Though interestingly enough, Tom Cruise's recent ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (which, by the way, I would say is a great tribute and dedication to the late Harold Ramis) did address how and why things where repeating over and over - and that worked well too!In the end, this film is definitely one of my favorite films of all time! Right along with ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) , ""Tall Tale"" (1995), & ""Shiokari Pass"" (1977) RIP, Harold Ramis, you innovative Jewish genius! You will be missed! And this will live on forever! And it DEFINITELY deserves more attention in my home country of Japan!9/10",Groundhog Day
301,E Canuck,Rare! Philosophical Hollywood,9,7 February 1999,"I enjoyed the film as entertainment and for Bill Murray at his best, with a serious flip side to his well-known flip attitude. More than that, though, I just LOVED Hollywood going philosophical on us, and doing a great job of it.Without giving too much of the story away, Murray's character faces the same situation most of us face, at some time: every day looks the same, the routine is unshakeable-- enough to drive you out of your mind. So what can you do?Well, naturally, you can try one sleazy thing after another-- Bill Murray's usual schtick. Then after all that has been tried and has failed (and here's where things become unusual, for Murray and for American popular movies) you can give up and do something really unusual, like trying to transform the rut you're in, by transforming yourself.Try it (the film) -- you'll probably like it. And if you're anything like me, you might even think of the movie, from time to time, when you feel stuck in a rut, and wonder what to do about it.",Groundhog Day

303,joshfedderson,"What if the Same day happened over, and over, and over again?",10,3 February 2018,"Yesterday was Groundhog Day and as tradition, I watch the movie Groundhog Day staring Bill Murray. This movie is a classic, and it is really hilarious. The film is about a weather man named Phil Connors, he is a stuck up, self centered, cruel man who doesn't really care about anyone but himself. It's Groundhog Day...again. And Phil has been assigned to report on the Punxsutawney annual Groundhog Day celebration and festivities. He is less then....enthusiastic about it. Once the celebration is over a big blizzard comes to town and Phil along with his crew are forced to stay in the town. 
The next morning things start to get weird and crazy as Phil wakes up and finds it's Groundhog Day all over again, and again, and again, and again. I love the humor in the movie, Bill Murray brings lots of laughs. I love the fact that he has to live the same day all over again for who knows how long? I like how he handles each day, he goes from partying maniac, to suicidal, to selfless, kind, and caring man. In the movie Phil has to learn a lesson, kind of like Ebeneezer Scrooge In A Christmas Carol, except for a different Holiday. The Story is about a man who never has love in his life because of his attitude towards others. That all changes when he has to live the same day over again, and when he starts to notice a producer. It's the story of a man who has no love in his life, time stops, repeats itself over again, and gives this man a chance (several chances) to makes things right. In the end the selfless, mean spirited man wakes up to find his one true love laying next to him. And time moves forward as it should and the man has the girl, is changed for the good, and the most important part of all he is happy.Groundhog Day is not only a comedy, it is a story about change and even though how much we really want to stop time, live days over again, and take another chance, it teaches us to live in the moment, look around us and be happy with what we have. 10/10 for Groundhog Day",Groundhog Day

305,advaitkamat,"Funny, innovative and Bill Murray.",7,4 December 2013,"Say, how many times have you wished to live a day again? Maybe when you're really happy about something, so happy, in fact, that you want to live it through all over again. Maybe a most perfect day you could imagine. ""Groundhog Day"" isn't a movie about those days. It's about a guy who relives the day of the year he despises the most. Tall order, you think, but director Harold Ramis actually gets away with it. He assembles a movie so thoughtful, so intelligent and so funny that you end up having a great time even if the idea does seem a bit far-fetched.We bump into Phil (Bill Murray), a cocky TV meteorologist who has to cover the Groundhog Day celebrations in Punxsutawney every year on February 2nd. Phil hates that part of his job. He's getting a better job, he brags at one point, so he won't have to go there again. Accompanying him on his little jaunt is Rita (Andie MacDowell), his producer, and Larry (Chris Elliott), his usual cameraman. Phil gets his weather calculations wrong on the big day and ends up being stuck in Punxsutawney after his broadcast because of a snowstorm. The next day, he wakes up to find himself living the same day over again. Initially surprised and spooked, he slowly begins to realize that he can't snap out of it unless the time loop is broken. As his frustrations quickly turn into mildly violent episodes, he begins to realize the other ways these odd circumstances could be used for.""Groundhog Day"" begins almost lazily as Ramis spends a considerable amount of time to build the story. But as the movie progresses, it grows increasingly engaging though there is a light risk of it being repetitive since the crux of the plot is about deja vu. Once we get the gist of what is about to unfold, the flow is impossible to stop. Smoothly edited and neatly written, ""Groundhog Day"" is a well-made crowd-pleaser that delights you with its wit. Cutting a fine line between a drama and a comedy, the film never takes itself too seriously. And therein lies its strength. Ramis is aware of the goofiness of the plot but the charming characters lead you to believe otherwise. ""Groundhog Day"" misfires at times when he doesn't know what it wants to be. And that's aggravating to watch because the hesitancy translates on the screen. There were stretches of time when I had no clue what the movie eventually wanted but that niggle is rectified when it slides into a new soul later on. The movie scores with its characters. Bill Murray is nothing short of terrific, bringing the much needed zing factor into the proceedings with his enthusiastic performance that is infectious. The beautiful MacDowell has never been so endearing and she delivers a nearly flawless performance that's nicely textured. Some of the secondary actors aren't as good, I'm afraid, because they are reduced to mere caricatures. But since they don't gobble up much of the screen-time, that doesn't pose as a major problem.""Groundhog Day"" is a charming, enjoyable fare that entertains and sermonizes in equal measure. If you're willing to overlook the minor hitches, it could be a movie that makes your day. And gives you a quick lesson in morals.",Groundhog Day
306,john in missouri,an unbelievable classic that just gets better as you rewatch it,10,13 November 2009,"Back in the mid-1990s, we had a friend named Jeff, who started talking to us rather oddly. He would make a comment in normal conversation, and then he would add, ""So am I right? Am I right or am I right or am I right?!"" And then he'd laugh as if he'd said something quite funny. And we'd just stare at him.Eventually Jeff loaned us a copy of Groundhog Day, and we discovered where he'd gotten that line from. But the first time we watched it, we thought the movie was kind of... strange.There aren't many movies that I watch more than once. I've seen hundreds of movies by now, and this one now holds the record for number of viewings. I do have to let some time go by before I see it again, but this is one of those rare movies that only seems to get better and better upon rewatching.Over the past 5 or 6 years I've put a lot of effort into bettering my own life. Today I was at the gym and caught the last 25 minutes of Groundhog Day while exercising. I was astonished at how some of the ideas in this movie parallel some of the ideas and understandings I've come to embrace about life and success. If you haven't seen Groundhog Day, see it.

307,Lt_Coffey_182,Comedy at its Best!,9,21 February 2004,"Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is caught in a time loop to create what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest comedies ever. This is one of those films I can watch over and over again and still be entertained and full of laughter.Bill Murray is one of those people who could say 'goose' and I would still laugh. His delivery of lines is always spot on and his physical acting is near perfect. In this film he gives a good mix of sarcastic wit, sadness and joy which other actors could not match. Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott provide good support but the real gem amongst the supporting cast is without doubt, Stephen Tobolowski as Ned Ryerson. The scenes between Phil and Ned stand out and provide great comic moments each time, the bit where Phil punches Ned cracks me up every time.Although far fetched, the story is fantastic and original. I remember a film I saw called 12:01 had a similar concept but did not come close and went to tiresome lengths to explain how the main character was caught in the time loop which Groundhog Day leaves a mystery. The love story between Phil and Rita causes a wonderful character transformation for Phil which is both funny and touching, leaving the audience with a great feeling of satisfaction.Harold Ramis does a very good job with what is actually a very challenging film if done right. The attention to detail with extras does well to maintain credibility and although subtle, is very noticeable. The extreme close up of the clock is very expressive in showing the 'Weight of Time', pausing the laughter for just enough time for the audience to feel great empathy towards Phil. Although more famous for being Egon in Ghostbusters, Ramis should regard this as his best achievement.This film makes me so happy when I watch it and that seems to be the overall effect on everyone who has seen this film which is why it is regarded as such a classic. Instantly quotable, this is one of those films that can be a real centre piece in conversation. Groundhog Day illustrates the phrase 'if at first you don't succeed, try, try again' and very effectively puts this message across.",Groundhog Day
308,Ryan_9,Excellent comedy and a great story!,10,20 May 2020,"Groundhog Day was a wonderful movie! I really liked the plot as it was very interesting with Phil Connors (Bill Murray) reliving the same day repeatedly. Obviously, the day he kept reliving was Groundhog Day. It was so funny seeing his reaction to the same things happening and how he memorized them as time went on. I really enjoyed the relationship that he and Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) developed throughout and how it led to something romantic. Earlier on, you wouldn't have expected this to happen.I loved how much Phil changed throughout the film and how reliving the same day made him into a better person. It showed a lot of growth.There were lots of funny moments in this as Bill Murray did an awesome job. I also liked the character Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky). Any scene that he and Phil interacted in was great.Overall, I'll rate ""Groundhog Day"" a 10/10. I loved it!",Groundhog Day
309,IkuharaKunihiko,"Man, what a masterpiece!",10,28 January 2005,"1993 was a wonderful movie year. 2 movie masterpieces stand out today from it; ""Schindler's list"" and ""Groundhog day"". Personally, I always loved the second one more. ""Groundhog day"" is a perfect example why Bill Murray will always be a superior actor than the Oscar darlings Tom Hanks and Spencer Tracy. He plays Phil whom thanks to a time distortion ( a day repeating itself again and again ) gets away with stealing money, committing suicide 20 times, sleeping with local girls without consequences and finding out everyones deepest secrets. The story is so subtle that you may at first think its just a comedy. But once you think about it, you will realize how almost every problem from life is contained in it. Most noticeable, the one about how people will make the same mistakes again and again, until they change. And that's what's all about: change. Once when Phil changes himself, the world changes finally too. He is a grown man, but childish in his persona. That's why thanks to the time distortion he ages psychologically, until he finally becomes a real man, not a spoiled kid. This is an extreme satire about life. Think about it. Its about the imprisoned human spirit crying for a change, a difference. Phil became an individual, the only person on Earth that has self-consciousness. At that moment all other characters just became puppets. You can also regard it as a parody of Totalitarian regimes ( Phil is the only person that does something different than the others, and that's why he is misunderstood ). Plus the explanation for the mysterious time distortion is never given. It's shown more like something as natural as the weather, something that just happened.--------------The only great film the director Harold Ramis ever made, ""Groundhog day"" was until recently the highest marked Murray film on the site rotten-tomatoes.com with extremely high average grade of 8.1/10. ""Lost in translation"" beat it, with 8.4/10, but quite frankly, it was overrated. If there was any justice, ""Groundhog day"" should have won Oscars and Golden Globes for the best picture, script and the main actor. But alas, since Murray was underrated for so long, its finally time he gets overrated for once!You just have to love him when he is in the studio doing a weather forecast: ""In California there is going to be a big heat tomorrow, and gang fights and too high real estate prizes too. Oh, what's this? A cold front is coming up! Fuuuu( blows the clouds on the screen)."" The only flaw is that some better director could have directed it more radical and extreme than Ramis, but if we love Frank Capra, we must love this symbolic story about the triumph of emotions over cold cynicism.Grade: 10/10",Groundhog Day
310,nucksfan4life,For any fan of Bill Murray,8,1 July 2002,"Bill Murray is such a talent when it comes to comedy. In ""Groundhog Day"" he really shines. Its definitely one of his best performances. Not only is he extremely funny, but its obvious that he goes to great lengths in order to develop his character of Phil Conners (kudos as well to the director for this development). I liked this movie mostly because of the way Murray reacts in different ways to the same events occurring over and over again. Each reaction is always new, always fresh and always entertaining. Rounding out the supporting cast, Andie MacDowell is okay as Murray's love interest, and Chris Elliot has some funny moments in the film as well.",Groundhog Day

A great movie directed by Harold Ramis, do not miss it, see it now.",Groundhog Day
312,kylopod,"A perfect blend of comedy, clever plotting, and character study",10,21 October 2005,"Even the funniest movies eventually stop making me laugh after I've watched them enough times that the humor no longer surprises me. A joke never has the same effect when you know the punch line in advance. But every once in a blue moon, a comedy comes along that is so thoughtful and meaningful in addition to being funny that after seeing it a dozen times and laughing less often, I start noticing its depth and insight. For me, no movie has so perfectly united hilarity with profundity as ""Groundhog Day,"" which happens to be my favorite movie of all time.Superficially, this film belongs roughly in the same genre as ""All of Me"" and ""Liar Liar,"" comedies in which a character becomes the victim of some weird supernatural fate and must adapt to the insane logic of the situation. But Steve Martin and Jim Carrey are geniuses of physical comedy, whereas Bill Murray specializes in understatement. I can't imagine any other approach having worked for this film, where the world is going crazy around Phil the weatherman, Murray's hard-edged character who keeps his emotions bottled up. What makes the initial scenes in which he first discovers his fate so hilarious is the mounting panic in his demeanor even as he tries to act like everything's normal. All he can think of to say is, ""I may be having a problem."" Uh, no kidding. Throughout the rest of the film, he'll deliver similarly muted lines to describe his situation, like ""My years are not advancing as fast as you might think."" It's striking that a man who has all the time in the world would choose his words so carefully, but it reflects a well-conceived screenplay.In this comedy, the laughs are reinforced by repetition. The absurdity of Phil discovering that he's repeating the same day is funny enough, but every time that alarm clock goes off, and the radio starts playing, ""I Got You Babe,"" and Phil goes through the same motions and meets the same people and then goes out into the street to be accosted by the same annoying high school buddy (""Phiiiil?""), I laugh again because I'm reminded how funny it was the first time around. People who didn't like this film (I've met one or two) emphasize how annoying it is that everything gets repeated. I sort of understand that complaint, since jokes repeated over and over usually fail miserably. ""Groundhog Day,"" however, works uniquely well because the situation gets increasingly absurd and Phil gets increasingly desperate with each day that fails to pass.The film would have fizzled out quickly had it spent the entire hour-and-a-half showing Phil meeting the same people and doing the same things time and again. The fact that ""Groundhog Day"" avoids this fate is one of its more striking qualities, since most high-concept comedies of this sort fall apart in the third act. ""Groundhog Day"" is a rare example of one that completely follows through with its premise, leading from the initial situation logically to the ending. Only the Jeopardy scene feels like a skit that could have appeared anywhere. But this scene actually is placed wisely: it occurs when Phil is becoming increasingly bored and lethargic, and it is used to separate two hilarious scenes where he gives nutty television reports.It is in the middle, centering on Phil's attempts to seduce Rita, when the film reveals itself to be more than just a comedy. The underlying implication of these scenes is that Phil's powers are less important than he thinks they are. He probably could have done the same things (such as his exploits with Nancy) under ordinary circumstances, without the hocus pocus. In the end, his powers don't matter, because Rita is too smart and sees right through him. She may not understand the full supernatural implications of what he's doing, but she senses that he's somehow manipulating the situation. Phil may think he's a god, but he isn't all-powerful.Phil's character development is convincing largely because we can so easily believe the situation would force him to look inward. Because he loves such a sincere woman as Rita, the only way he can finally impress her is by genuinely changing himself rather than faking it. The change he undergoes isn't an implausible leap, for he maintains many of the same basic character traits he had at the beginning, even though he becomes kinder and more caring. Earlier, Rita says that egocentrism is Phil's ""defining characteristic,"" and, indeed, he doesn't stop being egocentric at the end; he merely learns to channel the egocentrism in a positive direction.I have trouble imagining any other actor having pulled this off. Murray is not the only comic actor to have proved himself capable of dramatic depth, but he's one of the few who can so seamlessly combine his humorous and serious side into the same character. And he's a master at conveying complex emotions through an apparent deadpan. When his delivery sounds stilted in this film, the effect is intentional, for he's playing a man whose life has become a script.Though this film has a serious message, it is still quintessentially a comedy. But it's a comedy that uses psychological exploration of a fascinating character to make its point. After the laughter has worn down, ""Groundhog Day"" turns out to be one of the richest and deepest films I've ever seen.",Groundhog Day
313,nwlovell,Bill Murray's best film. Period. 10/10,10,28 January 2003,"BM's underrated masterpiece is one of those rare films you will want to watch many times.  Only a handful of films rate that way with me.  All guys nod along that, ""yup, that IS what I would try to do if I had the same day to live over and over again...""

314,SHAWFAN,human transformation so brilliantly and touchingly portrayed,10,12 October 2005,"I usually find a comment which sums up my thinking exactly. Here's the one I found this time: ""The most underrated movie ever made?, 22 October 1998 Author: Scoopy from Budapest When people assemble their lists of great film comedies, this never appears on the list. It should. It has absolutely everything a great comedy should have.""First, it's funny. Bill Murray is the master of comic insincerity and he plays it to the hilt in this movie. He is a weatherman who is to Ground Hog Day as Ebenezer Scrooge is to Christmas. Fate gets fed up with his attitude and forces him to relive that day until he gets it right.""Second, it's deep. He doesn't get it right the first time, or perhaps for years. He does what any human would do in the situation. Early on, he uses his knowledge of that day to play God. Then, he uses it to have fun and get women. Then, he is filled with despair and tries to end it with his own death. Then, after trying every crass and immature thing he can think of, he finally realizes that he can actually enjoy his fate if he is reliving a great day, so he makes it so. He makes himself a better person, but the transformation happens only after many missteps ... exactly what would happen to anybody really caught in the situation.""How many comedies do you know in which the lead character quotes Chekhov and recites French poetry? (or plays Rachmaninoff at the piano: my comment) Both to good effect (One sincere and touching, the other insincere beyond my ability to describe.) ""Murray is terrific, as is Andie MacDowell. The supporting players are all spot-on. It's just a terrific comedy. It should have won a whole bunch of awards. Why it did not is a mystery."" Besides Scoopy's apt reference to Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" we mustn't forget the Flying Dutchman legend as well: a sailor's curse keeps him sailing the ocean forever until he finds a woman on land who can redeem him from his curse with her love. Just like in this incredibly wonderful film: great, unique, undervalued; a treasure, a gem of a portrayal of the transformations of the human heart in which seemingly all-knowing triumphant domination and sexual success are followed by frustration and despair and finally redemption through love: still a great moral fable brought up to date for our time.",Groundhog Day

Not only does Bill Murray do a great job as always, but his characters really learns something. It kind of makes you think, too. What if you were trapped in a mess that you got yourself into? It would be up to you to work on it to improve yourself. That is exactly what Phil (his character) did. He was a real jerk at first, but he realized that if he wanted to go somewhere with his life, he had to be a better man. Groundhog Day would never end, and he was the only one who knew that the day kept repeating itself. There's a lot you could do, and he tried to continue to be a jerk. Then, he got himself in gear and started going in the right direction.This movie is well worth while, and I give it a 9/10. It is filled with laughter, adventure and entertainment.

317,sissoed,"A touching, humanistic, philosophical masterpiece",10,4 February 2009,"This is a marvelous and touching movie, a work of philosophy really, and it does what it needs to do to be popular and effective. My comments are not really criticisms of it as an effective movie, and would probably make it a less effective movie, but a more interesting work taken as philosophy. First, it is important and valuable because it teaches that to be a good person, you must be attentive to the feelings going on inside other people, and do what you can to make good people feel better. This is similar to what makes Jane Austen so appealing: the recognition that other people's feelings matter, and that it is a moral good for each of us to recognize that, to do nothing that gratuitously makes people feel worse, and to do things that make people feel better. Second, by confining all the action to the little town, there is a distinct 1950s nostalgic feel to the whole movie. Everyone Phil encounters is a good person, or at least, a not-bad person, even if annoying in parts. The day he lives over and over is in a town full of celebration over a very antiquated event, a very simplified human environment. The movie would have been more interesting had he been in a more troubled, complex, modern environment.Third, Phil's existence is in effect that of a very wealthy man. He has money to buy anything he wants, since he starts over each day with all of his expenses restored. He never has to fear bad health or worry about the future or fulfill any responsibility to anyone else. And he never ages. The one thing he can carry-over from day to day is learning and training. He puts that to use almost immediately, as he learns all about the different people in the town, and learns to anticipate what each person is going to do, or to suffer, at a particular point in the day. Then he figures out that he can learn skills as well as information, so he learns piano, ice sculpture, and who knows what else. The endlessly repeating day becomes an opportunity for Phil to embark on the mother of all self-improvement, self-education programs, completely funded by God or fate. I think that he would grow to appreciate this so much that he would not want real life to ""restart."" Fourth, I think that Phil's own awareness of his growing knowledge and skills, and comparison with the fact that everyone else in town makes no progress at all, would produce a change in his attitude towards the townspeople, and towards his love-interest. According to several other sources, Phil relives the one day more than 3,652 times (ten years including 2 leap- years). Ten years, every morning he sees the same attractive young woman, and she never changes. In the early period, as he gets to know her, he will grow to love her, but will he really be so lastingly enamored of her that he spends ten years trying to become a person who can evoke her to love him? His dedication to winning her love is a part of the movie-imposed context, similar to the fundamental fact that the day repeats over and over. Somehow, it is just a given that he is driven to win her love, no matter how many days he has to repeat in order to do so. Fifth, the movie's logic is that Phil earns the right to rejoin the normal world only by becoming a person who evokes in the heart of a good woman her sincere love. In the movie, she functions as a sort of proxy for God; if you earn her love, you have earned God's approval to rejoin the human world. This is a beautiful message and a very important one to make, but it raises the question: if she had not been in the town, could Phil ever have escaped? What if his world had not included anyone whose character was so good and sweet, that she or he functioned as a kind of proxy for God's judgment, because her or his feelings towards him were a proper moral judge of his character? And if we apply the lessons of the movie to our own lives -- which is what makes the movie important -- what if there is no person in our lives who is qualified to serve that role? If we live in a world of scoundrels, is there any way in which we can prove our worth? I would like to see a ""Groundhog Day"" that occurs to a young man in one of our drug-gang-ridden inner cities, or to an associate in a greedy law firm, to examine this problem. Sixth, once Phil rejoins the normal world where each day is different, where we age, where the money we spend does not magically reappear in our pockets the next morning, etc., his ten-year sabbatical will have left him almost incapable of dealing with it. Given his detailed knowledge of everyone in the town, it seems that he would set himself up as the most insightful therapist the town had ever seen, with apparently supernatural insight into every person and issue, and that he would run for mayor, be elected in a landslide, and become a famous author -- like the real ""Doctor Phil"" of TV and publishing fame. All this success would be founded on the ten-years' education he had obtained, absolutely for free, in the space of just one day. Phil is really a very lucky fellow.",Groundhog Day

On one of Phil Conners least favorite days of the year, February 2, he reports the weather just like he does every other day. But somehow he makes it through the day with his sarcastic comments and bad-mannered nature, waiting for tomorrow; hoping it is better. But tomorrow never comes. This movie brings so much more to the table than one would expect. Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role who learns important lessons throughout. The fact this it is labeled as a comedy is one that I think is wrong; that is merely one of the qualities that it offers. It is hilarious, heart breaking, touching, and inspiring, all of which I would hope to see in a film.

319,CalvinValjean,A Strange Sort of Masterpiece,10,3 February 2007,"GROUNDHOG DAY is one of those surprise wonders as a film that has grown so much more in prominence over the years. When first released, it seemed intended to be a typical romantic comedy with an SNL-feel (given the presence of Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray, Chris Elliot, and director Ramis who gave us STRIPES, CADDYSHACK, and VACATION, plus co-wrote GHOSTBUSTERS). And somehow, over time, the movie began to work its magic on audiences, slowly starting to make them reevaluate it, to see profound elements in it, and eventually label it as a classic. I've even heard it referred to as a spiritually significant film for some.Most everyone knows the premise: a Scrooge-like man finds himself doomed to relive the same day over and over again, for what apparently will be eternity. After accepting his situation, he goes through several phases: first taking advantage of the time loop for hedonistic pleasures, then entering a depressed, suicidal phase, and finally reaching out and becoming a new person. I think it's this last third that stays with audiences the most, as we watch our hero truly transform and care for others.Two things in particular make this a great movie:1. The creativity of the script. It's as if Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis took this premise and thought out every single idea they could do with it. We watch Phil use his situation to take advantage of women. Later he hears news of a man's death, then tries to save him the next day. We watch him commit suicide multiple times, only to keep waking up back on the same morning. He steals money and buys things, only to be back to square one the next day. Several times he makes a connection with Rita, but she will always have no memory of it the next time they meet. It's a wonder when, after seeing her throughout the whole movie, you'll see her in a scene 90 minutes in and she'll once more act like she hardly knows Phil. You have to admire the actors, filming scenes upon scenes countless times, having to give variations on the exact same situations that we keep seeing repeated.2. Bill Murray's performance. Like his character in LOST IN TRANSLATION, he plays someone who is funny and tired of being funny, and grows as a character throughout. Even when committing multiple suicides, Murray keeps the scenes darkly humorous. In fact, one has to admire the way the film never steps out of being a comedy. What if the script had been completely revamped and made to be a serious drama, with a non-comedic actor in the lead? Perhaps it would've worked, but it wouldn't have been THIS movie.The story never explains why this curse is happening to Phil, nor does it need to. The result is a film with a number of good laughs, and something more. GROUNDHOG DAY is a true achievement, and Murray and Ramis at their best.",Groundhog Day
320,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 3 out of 5,5,4 January 2003,"Groundhog Day has a great deal of potential, but ultimately fails to live up to its promise.  It isn't the concept that falls short; on the contrary, the plot is entertainingly original.  Self-centred reporter Phil Connors aims to leave Pennsylvanian backwater Punxsutawney as soon as possible after completing a story on the annual Groundhog Day Festival, but his plans are thwarted when he wakes the following morning and discovers that it's Groundhog Day again. . . . . . . . . . and again. . . . . . . . . Initially he sees this turn of events as akin to a nightmare, but soon realises that if there's no tomorrow, there are no hangovers and no consequences. . . . .. . . . . A storyline like this is very amusing per se, and there are some deft touches - such as Phil's audacious money-van heist, which succeeds simply because after innumerable Groundhog Days in succession, he knows Punxsutawney's routines so well.  Due to the inherent comedy Bill Murray's wisecracking attempts as Phil are unnecessary, they don't fit well with his character, and frankly someone making a face like a groundhog isn't that funny the first time, let alone meriting repetition.      Although this is a comedy there are some genuinely thought-provoking issues raised - Phil learns (and through him we realise) that spontaneity can never be choreographed, and an impulsive moment's beauty lies in the fact that it 'just happens'.  The film's biggest downfall is its predictability.  Despite the various entertaining shenanigans en route, we just know that in the end Phil will have learned some Valuable Lessons and become a Nice Guy. Overall though, Groundhog Day is a likeable movie, and would leave the viewer with a much greater sense of satisfaction had it - instead of showing the happy couple running hand-in-hand through the freshly fallen snow - used a less trite finale.",Groundhog Day
321,johnfos,"If at first you don't succeed... try, try, again!",9,19 June 2005,"There's an old Doors song that has the chorus line ""break on through to the other side"", and it comes to mind as I write. There are many movies now that begin by showing us an everyday, mundane, version of our world and then have the central character ""breaking through"" to something much more meaningful and significant.Probably The Matrix (1999) is the best example of such a movie, where a computer message implores Neo to ""Wake Up!"" and begin a journey that has him uncovering an alternate reality. And then there is The Truman Show (1998), where Truman (True Man) Burbank begins to suspect that his routine everyday existence in the town of Seahaven has another side to it. Even Star Wars (1977) has a dual reality theme, with a deeper reality being evident in scenes with The Force; the light sabre scenes with Darth Vader, in particular, are fights between spiritual warriors, not ordinary beings.And then we come to Groundhog Day where a nice cosy small town visit leads Phil Connors (Bill Murray) to move beyond the selfishness that has trapped him, towards being a more expansive and loving human being. He realises his limits and becomes a better person. This implies that our lives have a higher purpose and the movie is elevated from simply being a small town comedy.Groundhog Day is yet another example of a movie that can be enjoyed at two levels: as an entertaining and popular box office hit as well as a thought-provoking movie that raises questions about life, the universe and everything. What could have been an ordinary comedy is lifted up by an intelligent script as well as good acting and directing.

Except that he will be reliving the same day over, and over, and over, and over That's the premise of one of the best comedies I've ever seen: Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray and Andie McDowell. At first it might have seemed an ordinary comedy but when things started getting real weird and absurd is when Groundhog really takes flight and becomes an extraordinary story of perseverance, love and redemption. The reason I love Groundhog Day is that you start with a cynical and arrogant character named Phil (Bill Murray here at his very best) who unwillingly goes out on this special report about the Groundhog Day traditional annual event but would much rather be elsewhere. He's such a big city guy that he can't barely stand having to spend his precious time in this town, doing this silly report that he'd much rather not do at all, accompanied by his news crew of Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot). His day's experience is detailed extensively and it may seem that it's going nowhere until Phil wakes up the next morning to Sonny and Cher's I Got You Babe on the alarm clock. From then on it's as if he was having a déjà vu moment except that he's reliving the same day all over again. At first, he brushes it off as coincidental but as the day progresses he realizes that every event during his day in Punxsutawney is repeating itself and he can foresee every single thing that's about to happen beforehand. In the following days after his initial surprise Phil feels invincible, able to do and say things in a perfected way and hoping that ""doing it well"" is good enough for him to allow him to see the ""next day"" but, regardless of what he does, he wakes up to I Got You Babe every morning, in the same room, having to co-exist with same locals and visitors that come to see the groundhog predict the weather.READ FULL REVIEW IN MY BLOG ITALO'S CORNER",Groundhog Day
324,smoothrunner,A pilgrim's progress,9,18 February 2021,"It would seem like a pointless exercise - writing a review of a popular film, which has been released almost 30 years ago. Everything has long been written, criticized, rewritten, forgotten and written again. But when you revisit Groundhog Day again with a different baggage of experience than before, you begin to notice those aspects and perspectives that was not previously understood and perceived, even if someone noticed it. I will refrain from briefly describing the plot and praising the witty lines and acting of the ironic-cynical Bill Murray, as well as the charming Andie MacDowell, and focus on the main things.What would you like from your life if everything was allowed (and without any consequences)? I think a lot of people, at least me, will think about their old, unfulfilled dreams, about desires that they did not realize because of saving money, time or fear of consequences. The hero of the film, Phil, received such an opportunity - to become ""a god"" of a small world, the town of Punxsutawney. Having mastered his newfound power, Phil goes through mortal sins, starting with gluttony (a scene of gluttony in a cafe), fornication (seducing local beauties), greed (robbery of collectors), vanity (flaunting a Mercedes bought for stolen money with a young curvy blonde) and ending with anger and sloth (various suicide attempts and apathy). Satisfaction of all desires, as is clear from the sloth in which the hero fell, does not bring him joy. Satisfied desires become the same mindless routine that Phil suffered from before, but now there was nothing to strive for.A new goal is given to him by communication with Rita, with whom Phil is in love (and whom he could not seduce). ""Princess"" Rita, who studied for 12 years in a Catholic school and studied French poetry in college - the embodiment of impracticality, according to Phil, - also embodies in Groundhog Day the moral purity (kindness and beauty) that Phil strives for, but cannot achieve, admitting that he is not worthy of Rita. For the hero, she becomes a reference point and Phil tries to direct his capabilities not to the endless satisfaction of his desires, but to helping others and self-development. He begins to read a lot, learns to play the piano, carves sculptures out of ice, tries to get to know people and their problems. Phil does this ""out of fullness"", like God who has everything and tries to share the abundance with others, which gives him joy. Phil begins to feel joy, helping all the residents of the town day after day. However, he is still not omnipotent and realizes this, trying to help an old homeless man who, however, still dies at the end of the day, no matter how hard Phil tries. Looking at the sky Phil realizes that he is not ""omnipotent"", cannot raise the dead, but can imitate God, doing good deeds to the extent of his capabilities. This is also indicated by the final lines of Joyce Kilmer's poem ""Trees"", which Phil reads to Rita: ""Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree"". Phil transforms, sincerely loving neighbors as himself and helping them: he saves a boy who has fallen from a tree, the mayor who choked, helps the collector Felix to cure his back, helps the bride with wedding, gives a wedding gift and even buys unnecessary insurances from the annoying insurance agent. Rita notices Phil's transformation and falls in love with him. When the transformation and mutual love bring Phil the long-awaited tomorrow, he decides to stay with Rita in his beloved town, which he no longer considers a deaf and dull province inhabited by ""morons who like blood sausages."" Whether intentionally or accidentally, Groundhog Day depicts the Christian's journey of love, repentance, death, and transformation. Only then does he find his way to ""tomorrow"" through the ""gates to Heaven"", like the heroes of the film, passing into their future through the hotel gate with the camera plan shifting to the sky.",Groundhog Day

His deadpan acting style shines, especially when he plays a glum yet carefree victim to this strange situation. He shines with an odd comedic charisma as he seeming shares, but is actually directly copying without them knowing, interests with people he meets, speaking in a very over the top soft voice. He drives in into maximum overdrive, doing the most outrageous things in peace of mind. The movie also has other things to it, such as Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell's chemistry, making it an experience, where if I was stuck in a time loop watching this, it wouldn't be so bad.",Groundhog Day

Bill Murray gives his own flavor to comedy, deals with sarcasm to perfection. The biggest plus of the movie is the lesson(s) it teaches you about life, like you never stop trying especially when you are in love, you try to hit the perfection level and luckily this guy had several chances too, to do so. Another way to look at it is, also when you spend a lot of time with certain people, over a period you do tend to develop good feelings towards them. It is symbolic in sense that life can be so much better if you try to be good to people around, it is a petty cost you pay to be away from frustration or its worst form, depression. On the technical side, the repetitive sequences in the movie could have been lessened by combining some of them because towards the end they do become a little irritating. But the curiosity to see how it will end & Bill Murray's face expressions keep you up. It is a well casted movie, gets into motion right away. The scenes have been ordered sensibly, keeping in line with Bill Murray's state of mind (in the movie ;)). All in all good stuff with good after taste too.",Groundhog Day

It's a well-deserved title as it is one of those rare films you can watch no matter how many times you've seen it and you are always glad when it turns up on TV. Bill Murray, who pretty much took a 10 year sabbatical from major movie roles after this film, is at the height of his powers and conveys the contrasting sides to Phil Connors character brilliantly. Andie MacDowell is charming as the object of his affections, and Ned Ryerson is a memorable cameo from Stephen Tobolowsky. An 'It's a Wonderful Life' for the 21st Century? Could be.

Weatherman Bill Connors played by the excellent Bill Murray is a miserable and selfish type character who is a weatherman for the news. He reports on a tradition called Ground hog day in a small Town with his crew. I won't go into detail of the story, but he basically wakes up in a time loop reciting the same day over and over again.

334,Klaatu-18,It's that day... again.,8,5 May 2007,"Bill Murray plays a complete jerk. That's okay because you know that it's going to come out all right in the end.The fun in this movie is seeing the character arc of Phil Conners. We're never told in so many words just why he's condemned to live the same day over and over. It seems that it does have something to do with how very nasty Phil is at the start of things.He hates his job, doesn't care for his co-workers and really doesn't want to be covering Groundhog Day again. So fate steps in and stops time for Phil. He's not going to get past that day until he reforms.It doesn't happen overnight. He spends dozens, if not hundreds of Groundhog Days in Punxatawney. At first he just acts worse, taking advantage of the simple people of the town. But then he realizes that he's in love with his producer (Andie McDowall).So he's got this same day to run over and over again to convince her that he's not a total jerk. And, in order to do that, he needs to reform himself. At first it's just superficial stuff, like remembering her favorite ice cream. But then he has to go beyond that and truly become the man of her dreams. And do it in the few hours that he's got until the whole thing resets again.Bill Murray works wonderfully in this role. His low-key style of humor fits in well with his road to rehabilitation.This film is one of the ""few"" I have in my collection. I only buy titles that I'm likely to play over and over. And, about once a month, I do watch it over again.A wonderful movie. I recommend it highly.",Groundhog Day
335,RagingDraugr,"An exciting fantasy comedy wrapped in a romance, that pushes its 'time loop' concept to the maximum creative potential.",10,15 September 2018,"As I watched Groundhog Day, over time, just like Phil does with Punxsutawney in this movie, I began to fall in love with it. Firstly, Bill Murray is, of course, great in his role as the narcissistic deadpan Phil - but the film allows Murray to expand upon that archetypal character. The film joyfully toys with his evolution over the film from this passive-aggressive, depressed weatherman to a kind-hearted man who, through his ambiguous amount of time in the Groundhog Day loop, learns to appreciate the smaller things in life or rather, the smaller towns and the intricacies of their citizens. And this time loop brilliantly facilitates this transformation. Phil goes from paranoia to joyriding to suicide to eventual acceptance of his situation, becoming a better person for the people of Punxsutawney.Secondly, Harold Ramis' role as director and main screenplay writer means the time loop concept is pushed to its absolute breaking point. In contrast, in 'Back To The Future', the concept of time travel is explored, but it feels like it could have been pushed a bit further. But 'Groundhog Day' finely examines and cherry picks from the whole spectrum of ""What would you do if you essentially had infinite time to play with (or more accurately, to get trapped in)?""There's also a surprisingly sweet love story between Phil and his producer Rita that, despite him technically only knowing her for less than a day, he comes to understand her intimately and acutely.Lastly, there is a surprising amount of clever symbolism and shot composition. For example, the opening shot of the same cumulus clouds rolling past in shot after shot foreshadows both Phil's job as a weatherman and the time loop that is to come. Or how about the ""snow shovel man"" who we see in the background of a shot where Phil is making a phone call only for him to come in and whack Phil in the head with said shovel? The film is littered with many of these cunningly well-placed visual gags as well as a vast array of sharp witted verbal jokes. To put it simply, Harold Ramis' assured direction and pure imaginative talent makes 'Groundhog Day' an exemplary example of how to make a superbly engaging film out of a deceptively simple idea - through compelling character development, unmatched creativity, quick wit and carefully crafted visuals.",Groundhog Day

A nice story about a selfish reporter with the Channel 9 and how one day, ""Groundhog Day"" changes his life forever. The characters and the entire set-up was really good. Bill Murray as Phil Connors was terrific and his personality change was totally convincing. This film entertains, makes you laugh, but above all the fun you have while watching this, it makes you think about the person you want to be and what you are. Actually it teaches you, 'How to be a better Human-being?' The supporting cast including the pretty Andie MacDowell were all very good. Truly a feel good movie.

337,mkm-hermanjnr,"An extremely ambitious, intelligent comedy that nails everything it aims at",10,1 October 2019,"I'm not a fan of romantic comedies in general, but Groundhog Day is the exception. In my opinion, it is a cinematic masterpiece.This movie transcends simply being ""guy meets girl, guy loves girl"" or ""obnoxious guy becomes good"" and touches on the complex themes of existentialism, nihilism, depression, love, morality and the nature of life.Lofty stuff for a comedy about a weather man! In fact, Groundhog Day's aspirations are so ambitious, it's really quite amazing that the film manages to pull off everything it goes for note-perfectly.The jokes are consistently funny, the acting is consistently good, the characters are consistently likeable and interesting and every scene is watchable. There is not one part of the movie I find boring or laboured, which given the mix of comedy and pathos is very impressive.The repetition of the film, which could so easily be tedious or overplayed, is in fact brilliantly done too. Repeated scenes are used both as a dark reprise (as when we see Murray staring with cold contempt at the sinister looping clock by his bed) and for humour (when we see Murray leaping out of bed and smugly echoing the same radio clock).Best of all, such an outlandish plot feels believable thanks to the great acting by Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell.When Murray's character Phil ever-so-slowly begins to mellow and mature, and then tells MacDowell that he loves her when she's asleep, we *feel* it.It could so easily just be a cheesy ""I love you"" scene, but seeing Murray subtly convey this sleazy and insincere man having a genuine change of heart and showing true love towards someone works entirely as a heavy emotional moment.Unlike many other movies that attempt it, Groundhog Day also juggles varying emotional tone with real skill. Phil's situation flits between funny to heartbreaking to funny again several times throughout and at no point does it feel fake, schmaltzy or exploitative, due to the strong script. The way the film handles the topic of suicide is a perfect example.In one scene Phil kills himself with a toaster and it's a darkly amusing laugh out loud, almost absurd moment.Right in the next scene we see him throwing himself off a building and instead of the funny treatment, we get a fade into sombre music and a poignant slow-mo shot of him falling through the air, as the film suddenly shifts gear.In this moment the film respectfully portrays the same act of suicide in a way that sells us the desperation and sadness of Phil's situation. The clever nature of the toaster scene then becomes apparent - it gets the absurdity of Phil's ineffective suicide out of the way quickly, so the repeat scene right after with the building can pack a big emotional punch instead of a comic one.Anyway I've rambled long enough. All you need to know is that this film is fantastic, and you should see it if you haven't already.",Groundhog Day

It *is* exceptionally funny, the perfect vehicle for Bill Murray's sardonic wit, but like Frank Capra's work (which this film most closely resembles) there is great depth and a message here.

340,the-jerk,Incredibly deep and also hilarious,10,13 June 2005,"""Groundhog Day"" is another example of a movie that deserved multiple nominations (and wins) at the Academy Awards. At the time, it was often dismissed as a light fantasy-comedy. But actually Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis wrote an incredibly intelligent, heartwarming, and funny script, and Bill Murray put in the performance of his lifetime.Phil Connors, played by Murray, is having a bad day. A nearly infinite amount of times. I don't believe the story that the movie takes place over 10 years of reliving the same day; it's clearly implied that it's A LOT more than that, and that's what the screenwriter originally had intended anyway. And this is where the brilliance of both the script and Murray's performance lies; we're not watching the same thing over and over again, because we have as a focal point Phil, who's reliving the day and reacting to it differently each time. The stages he goes through until he finally learns to accept it and try to make something of it are interesting. By the end of the movie he's reached something akin to nirvana, where every move he makes is perfect, and thus he's finally allowed to move on.We never get an explanation of why this is happening, which only heightens our fascination of it. It seems implied by the ending that something divine is going on; Phil really seems to reach perfection, a state of being, perhaps, a perfect human being, or as close to it as we can get, and that's where the timescale becomes apparent; think how long it would take to achieve such a thing! And all this is masked at first appearance by all the humor going on. At first glance, it really appears to be a screwball comedy (and even as such, it's laugh-out-loud funny), and you can't see the brilliance behind everything. It's a nearly perfect movie, and it's one of my favorites.",Groundhog Day
341,SebaZava,Comedic perfection,10,4 May 2009,"I'd been wanting to watch Groundhog Day for some time, but it was only when I ordered the Blu-Ray version a couple of days ago that I could finally sit down and watch the bloody film. I'd heard a lot of stuff about it, I had seen a couple of scenes in cable (never managed to finish the movie for a diversity of reasons), but I'd never seen the movie.Well, now I have. And I definitely don't regret the experience.It's no mystery that Bill Murray is one of the most gifted comedians... no, wait, scratch that, gifted actors in modern cinema. He is funny in a way that one doesn't realize he is actually being funny until you listen to what he is saying. He doesn't depend on wacky mannerisms or profanity in order to make audiences laugh; it's his matter-of-factly delivery of lines and the actual lines that he says that make him so funny. Most comedies he's done are pretty great - including, of course, Groundhog Day -, and even some of the mediocre films he's done get elevated by his presence.Now, Groundhog Day has a complicated premise, but it deals with it in a very simple, straightforward manner that nevertheless makes one think, laugh and admire what the filmmakers are conveying. Weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) is in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. It's February the 2nd. And it's Groundhog Day - a day he hates so much, he only comes to the Pennsylavian town to do his work and leave immediately before he kills himself. This day is different, though, much to his concern - time has seemed to stop, and he's reliving this same dreaded day over and over again, indefinitely. He's definitely not crazy, but how can he tell anyone, even his co-workers Rita (Andie McDowell) and Larry (Chris Elliot) about his current situation? The thing about Groundhog Day is that it's got a really smart premise and that it doesn't mess with it. Although it avoids many potentially-grim possibilities, it nevertheless explores a lot of things Phil could do with his new powers - memorize everything that happens in town, kill himself and doing illegal stuff without suffering the consequences, trying to conquer Rita's love, and many more. I liked the movie because it's both smart and funny, and the humour it provides with is intelligent enough and diverse enough for all audiences to enjoy the film. There's no place for bathroom jokes and profanity in this movie - in fact, this is one film that proves comedies don't have to be R-rated in order to be hilarious.I also like that it doesn't provide with any explanations for Phil's predicament - after all, this is a comedy, and since we see everything from Phil's point of view and he doesn't really have a way of learning the reason for the time loop, then the audience doesn't have to know it either. Instead of focusing on the scientific aspect of the story, the movie provides with something more humane, something more basic. It deals with romance, comedy, everyday-situations being repeated - in subtly different ways - over and over again and, of course, the redemption of Murray's character, who starts the movie as a total creep and ends it as a wiser, gentler man. My God, i's almost as if he's learned a lesson! Does saying that he earns Rita's heart constitute as a spoiler? I don't think so. I believe the viewer actually expects this to happen, and is simply waiting to see how it will happen.Groundhog Day is a masterwork, not only because it delights on a technical level, but also because it's one of those few comedies that manages to touch tickle the funny bone and touch the heart. It isn't formulaic by any means - although it does fulfill some expectations most members of the audience might have - and, despite being a little longer than most comedies, it never feels tiresome or overlong. Considering most comedies nowadays are either boring retreads or R-rated endeavors (which are really funny on their own right - see Tropic Thunder or Pineapple Express) that can't be enjoyed by the whole family, it's always a good idea to watch such a clean, fun and particularly smart movie like Groundhog Day.",Groundhog Day

Imagine my pleasure to learn that this movie occupies a spot on the top #250. A true testament to its appeal.I have many favorite movies that are comedies but what sets Groundhog Day apart from the rest is its message of redemption. Okay, maybe that is a message that today's post-modern moviegoers don't want to hear. But some odd coincidences with my own life endowed the movie with an unusual resonance for me personally. For example, I had taken up studying piano and Rachmaninoff's 18th Variation was one of the pieces I aspired to master (q.v. the dance at the end). I also had read many Chekhov works (q.v.

He's a Scrooge character, but the story does so much more than just scaring him into virtue. He goes through many stages before he reaches the best version of himself.And thats what's so inspiring about this film. Phil wakes up each day with exactly the same possibilities, and only his mindset decides whether his day ends in failure or success. He can choose to hate the town and his job and become miserable, or engage in them and become happy.Now most of us don't have the luxury (or curse) of getting the chance to improve while the rest of the world is put on hold.

Having the main character Phil, played by Bill Murray, be a easily unlikable character allows for some great storytelling and character development that you don't get a chance to have in other films. By giving Phil unlimited days to grow and change, while everyone around him will always remains unchanged, only highlights Phil's journey to become a better man that much more. In that journey there is a lot of comedy, with terrific directing from Harold Ramis, and one of Murray's best performances.

350,Winds_of_Destination,One heck of a Groundhog Day,8,30 August 2007,"Groundhog Day: the story of one man caught seemingly in a never-ending time warp that constantly repeats itself on February 2nd. While the premise of the film is very appealing and original as well as the bulk of the movie itself, I think it falls a bit short of landing a spot in the top 250.The first 20 minutes or so details what we are going to be seeing for quite awhile in the movie. It develops a sarcastic man named Phil, played hilariously by Bill Murray. He's guy who pretty much hates everything, and he's covering Groundhog Day in Pux-a-something, in which everything is horrible. He is even stuck in this town because of a blizzard, so he's forced to return to his dreaded town, and eventually fall asleep.Once Phil wakes up, he immediately notices the same song playing and two idiots attempting to make the weather report they made yesterday. Everything outside is the same, the same events begin happening, and his worst fears are realized when a lady confirms it is Groundhog Day. He lives throughout the day trying to solve this problem, and eventually, must stay in the town again (the blizzard once again has trapped him here).The next day it happens again. And every time it happens, it creates more laughs. Fortunately, the director knew when to stop in order not to tire itself out, and the events would be altered based on Phil's reactions to everything.It is once the formula is changed, sadly, where humor is not as consistent. While there is certainly a great deal of it and even a hilarious suicidal montage, the film has lost its steam and traveling at an average-comedy pace. Towards the end, the film transitions finally into more of a drama. Why? I'll get into that a bit later.Over the course of the film we see Phil's personality making drastic and eventual changes. First he freaks out about Groundhog's Day, then becomes even more of a jerk by using the day to his advantage. But his daily wants and needs cause him to feel pain and misery for awhile, and he still sees no way out. It is only when a girl he likes offers him indirect advice that he begins an ascent in his perspective of life and a change in himself.The transition begins when Phil becomes selfless, and even though it doesn't have the tone of a drama, Phil seems to be more serious about things. It's kind of sad, though, because all the humor was working well.There's really not much more to say about Groundhog Day. It's a good film that should be viewed by everyone. It is most plausible in its comedic moments and still pretty good in its more serious moments; some of those moments are even rather touching, and those serious moments are worthy of commendation. In the end, I'd have to give this film a 7.6/10. It's good but loses steam after about 40 or so minutes with only one other quick train of top-notch humor.",Groundhog Day

He is not just delivering some funny script lines, he's performing with his full body. It's funny when he looks, when he reacts, when he wakes up (every morning). That's something which is missing from comedies nowadays. And Groundhog Day doesn't need to explain everything to us. Murrays weatherman ist reliving the same day again and again. Why? We don't know. But it's not relevant for the story. Reitman focuses on Murray and on the recurring events that vary from time to time.

353,Logic404,Great but still one thing bothering me...,9,13 August 2006,I've seen this film 5 or 6 times throughout the years and I still hold great affection for it. The first half or so is funny and the second half is good on another level (a romantic comedy level). But I really think this movie is about being a better person overall.The thing that bothered me was as follows...I wanted Bill Murray's character to stay up all night until 6:00am and then see what happens. He would be awake during that time so it would be fun to see what unfolds. That kept on nagging at me when I watched this movie recently. (This problem didn't keep me from rating this movie fairly though)Pull this movie out anytime you want to watch a good comedy with romance and fantasy in it. I still enjoyed it after multiple viewings and to me that says a lot.,Groundhog Day

357,mcgriswald,Murray and Ramis' Greatest Film,10,26 January 2007,"On the very first episode of ""Late Night with David Letterman"", Bill Murray ran to the edge of the stage where he led the audience in an impromptu set of calisthenics while he sang ""Lets Get Physical"". That was the early Bill, a man who paradoxically was a smarmy phony and infectiously enthusiastic at the same time.Later on, in ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Broken Flowers"" Murray has become more introspective. ""Groundhog Day"" somehow catches Murray as he in the midst of the transformation from early Bill to the current Bill.When I first saw ""Groundhog Day"" I remember leaving the theater feeling oddly moved, as if I had just witnessed something that was simutltaneously humorous fluff and deeply important. Later on, and upon further viewings, it dawned on me that this was the greatest film of redemption ever made, and one of my favorite films of all time.I won't rehash the plot, other than to say that Murray's character, Phil, undergoes a transformation from incredulity to opportunism to despondence, and finally acceptance and understanding that this day is his to perfect.During his transformation, Phil goes from superficial to caring and motivated, and to me that is an interesting parallel with Murray's career. One scene that is particularly telling is when Phil is wooing Andy McDowall's character by using information he has gleaned on previous days. At first, his attempts work, but as he tries to re-create the scenes that help his seduction succeed, his method becomes rote and forced. Like his voice work on the ""Garfield"" films, he is just phoning it in.Once he realizes that his attempts are a sham, Phil becomes despondent and tries to get himself out of his personal purgatory by various attempts at suicide, but each day starts anew with Sonny and Cher singing ""I Got You, Babe"". As Phil reaches acceptance of his fate, he takes his cue from the characters and the town of Punxatawny, and becomes genuinely interested and involved with his surroundings.On Phil's final day, Ramis and Murray shine. Not one misstep, everything clicks, and you can't help but smile as Phil captures the love and attention of the town and his associates not through guile and phoniness, but with genuine effort and caring.If you are one of the few people who hasn't seen this fine film, rent or buy the DVD ASAP. To this day, I don't believe that Ramis and Murray are fully aware of the importance of this film, but as time has gone on since its release, critics (including the IMDb folks) have recognized as the truly excellent film that it is.",Groundhog Day

What an intriguing concept this is, and how cleverly it is told. The repeating day formula could easily become hammy, unfunny and tedious, but it is constructed beautifully. The key to this is the absence of long-term temporal reference - we are stuck in the same day as Phil, but without knowing how much we haven't seen. We see relationships at key points, we see plans at their inspiration and at their culmination, and the way we are constantly made to play catchup and fill in the blanks contributes to a sense that we are sharing and matching Phil's relationship with his predicament. A simple premise continually manages to find new avenues to surprise us, without ever feeling as though its movements are purposeless. There is a fantastic sense of direction here, and it makes the film far deeper than initially expected. This film plays with you gently, and charms you into engaging in what appears a mundane setup.

362,jack_94706,A wonderful fantasy/comedy -- actually about spirituality,9,11 January 2001,"Groundhog Day, the holiday, provides the springboard for a lively romantic tale, very funny -- with about twenty times the imagination of most such fare. The subject, the hidden message (not hidden very deeply), if you will, is about what it feels like to be stuck -- to be unable to transcend your own problems and limitations. Sounds like a film about learning to be mature, about being willing to listen to others, learning to care about them. These are spiritual matters. But this film has Bill Murray, right? And what a fine job he does. No one would go to see a straight-out religious film about learning to be kind, learning to listen, about what really makes living worthwhile -- well, OK, a few people might. But make it into a lively comedy (and why not?  Dante's great poem was ""The Divine Comedy,"" after all) -- and you get something like this. ""Groundhog Day"" should be classed alongside, or even above, to my mind, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Every parent should take their kid to see this film -- if you have a larger family, take each one of your kids individually, make the occasion special thereby. Then talk about it together, ask your child they liked about it. This is non-denominational spirituality; Gandhi said ""God has no religion."" This comedy has that kind of Gandhian quality, in the best sense. This film can be especially wonderful and powerful for young men, even teenagers -- because it seems like Murray's character is happy exploring all kinds of mischief, delighted about getting away with everything -- almost. Then he gets kind of angry. Personally, growing up, especially during my teen years, I thought being angry was what being a man was all about.  Not that I always ""thought"" about it; but a deeper, subconscious feeling  lived inside me, the sense that anger would protect me, or make me strong. Hey, don't get me wrong -- seeing this film didn't get me over that. But getting over it, or at leasting understanding where I'd been, etc., was a huge step for me. ""Groundhog Day"" made me receptive to more positive thinking, because it didn't preach. Oh, did I mention I couldn't stop laughing in the theater and worried about embarrassing other people around me because I was laughing so much? Most of them were laughing, too. A great film; I really believe that. People love Charlie Chaplin's ""Little Tramp"" -- the same kind of sentiment applies for me to this film. I buy very few films, since renting nowadays, and cable and satellite dishes all work so well. But ""Groundhog Day"" is one of about ten videos I've bought in the last twenty years.

365,Artless_Dodger,Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell star in this delightful Harold Ramis romantic comedy.,9,15 March 2016,"Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell star in this delightful Harold Ramis romantic comedy. Murray plays Phil, an egotistical and shallow TV weatherman presenter, sent to report on Groundhog Day with Rita (MacDowell) as the producer, and cameraman, Larry (Chris Elliott).Stranded by an unexpected blizzard, Phil wakes up each morning to the same day, over and over. Phil sees this as an opportunity to enjoy himself at the expense of those around him, but as he becomes aware of his growing affection for Rita , and her dislike of him, he grows to understand that there is much more to life than the superficiality of his earlier shallow existence. In doing so, he changes into a much warmer and kinder individual, and finds life treating him very differently, now that he is behaving to others differently.It's a fairy-tale of sorts. Beautifully played by both leads, it's full of charm. However, at it's core is a delicious performance by Murray finding nuance and humour in almost every line. The gradual transformation is well served by an intelligent script, ensuring that repeating scenes always have something fresh to offer. It's a serious comedy. Murray's dramatic depth is required too, particularly in scenes with an old man. Murray's comic abilities were never to be doubted, but here he does much more than make us laugh. It's possibly his finest ever performance.It's a film full of hope for all of us, and it deals with some of the biggest issues. A lovely film.",Groundhog Day

After spending the worst day of his life in a town that he hates, he begins to repeat the same day over and over again.

372,Brad2002,Interesting as well as entertaining (may contain spoilers),9,14 February 2004,"The movie ""Dead Poet's Society"" referred to a poem called ""To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time"", which is known as a 'carpe deim poem'. Carpe deim is latin for 'sieze the day'. This is a major theme in Groundhog Day.     Bill Murray plays, weatherman, Phil Conners - a cynical, bad tempered man who, each year, has to visit Pugsatawny to see if the Groundhog will see his shadow. We watch him go through the day in a 'let's get this over with and get the hell out of here' attitude only to find he's stuck there for the night due to a snow storm. He wakes up the next day to find, to his dismay, that it's Groundhog day all over again. This cycle is repeated endlessly throughout the movie, until he learns to 'sieze the day' and make the most of it. What makes this movie good is that it exploits an interesting theme( look at the bright side and/or make the most of the day ) as well as entertains. When he realizes what's going on and gets used to the idea ( after 2 or 3 times of reliving the same day )he does what many of us would : take advantage of the situation. My favorite is asking several blunt questions about what school an attractive woman he doesn't know went to and who was her teacher and so on and then the next day ( which of course is groundhog day again ) pretending to know her by using the information he got the last time around. After the fun and games, though, he focuses on how to get out of the cycle. He tries to kill himself in several different ways, which doesn't work. It's only when he uses the time in an unselfish/make-the-most-of-the-day manner that the cycle is broken. This is another one of those movies that you can watch over and over again ( ironic, hey? lol ) and still enjoy.",Groundhog Day

Although he wakes up at 6:00 AM on Feb. 2 just over 30 times in the movie, it is understood from the plot that he actually goes through hundreds, if not thousands, of iterations.He learns how to play the piano, how to ice sculpt, and how to pick up women with reckless abandon. But, finally, he learns something much more important.During his plight of reliving Groundhog Day, he commits suicide by every means known to man.

Not the case here, it's still a perfect comedy after 18 years. Andie McDowel has never been as good as in this movie. Maybe with the exception for her performance in ""Four weddings and a funeral"". Bill Murray is also playing one of his funniest character. But the best part of this film is the screenplay. It seems that it was the first try by screenwriter Dany Rubin. He wrote the story, and did co-writing of the script with director Harold Ramis. I don't know which part of the success of this film is due to who, but it doesn't matter.

375,toolkien,Shawshank Redemption of comedies......?,8,30 June 2006,"Both movies seem to have had decent theatrical runs and seemed to be destined for the scrap heap of old movies. Then both caught a sustained second wind on TV and have grown in respect and 'importance' since.Anyway, I saw Groundhog Day on the opening weekend, and saw it several times more at the theater (3 times I think) and appreciated its subtle messages from the start, and perhaps insularly, thought I seemed to be the only one who got that it was deeper than the basic romantic comedy let on. I guess I was wrong. I've seen the movie several times since, and have been surprised by subsequent reevaluation by the likes of Roger Ebert and essays in such periodicals as the National Review about its meaning. It would seem that spiritualists from many cultures have seen this movie and approve of aspects of its deeper message. No small feat for what must have appeared to be a popcorn movie from the outset.The movie's main message seems to be very fatalistic in that whatever is destined to happen will happen regardless of what we try to do about it, but it is veiled from us, so we may as well enjoy and appreciate life as much as we can. But a little deeper, it seems to say that only some things are predestined, others we can change for the better, and if we accept certain inevitabilities we cannot control, learn to be happy in the moment, other variable aspects will change as well, enhancing the time we have. Simply being a courteous person instead of a twit paid huge dividends.Perhaps the message of self sacrifice is too much at times (I don't hold with concepts of coerced sacrifice and don't cotton to much to the idea that one is trapped in their own hell unless they put everyone else first). But there are examples during Phil's conversion that is simply courteousness on Phil's part. He certainly learned the lesson of cultural conventions that make life a lot easier. I try and ignore the more egregious examples of sacrifice that were required before Phil was allowed to 'escape'. But an acceptable flaw for all that, but knocks one * off the pile.The movie itself has been sliced and diced here enough, but just a few things that I noticed that perhaps only a few have. One is the scene where Larry is at the bar trying to put the moves on Nancy Taylor, it is at the precise moment when Phil had been trying to gather information about Rita, complete with the bartender's shaking of his head at such obviousness. Seems to say that even some small aspects of life are destined to be, but simply will happen to other people as people change aspects of themselves - Phil is no longer setting up Rita, but guys will always putting moves on somewhere. What message there is there I don't know, but yet speaks to the fabric of destiny woven around us.The second is that it would seem that at the precise moment Rita felt she loved Phil is when the snow comes curling down (and Phil looks up - to heaven?). It is that covering of snow which Phil sees the next day that clinches it for Phil that the day is, indeed, Feb 3rd. I appreciate how subtle the change is, and comports with the message of the movie. Other productions likely would have cued a swelling of strings to beat the viewer over the head that THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT. Important moments in real life don't come with soundtracks.The movie only suffers a couple of blemishes that prevent it from getting a full ten stars. One is the slightly heavy hand in the self-sacrifice category, it can come off a bit like Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, simply put, see things my way or you'll end up in my ""hell"". And the other is Andie MacDowell who annoys me in whatever I have seen her, and this is no different. I'm not going to overlook her poor abilities in attempt to bolster a top notch production even more. She is a poor actress and is a net negative to the material.",Groundhog Day

And the happy ending lets things down slightly - it would maybe be better if he worked hard to achieve the perfect day, and then had to do it again, for all eternity.But it's an enjoyable film, made by the little throwaway lines (Larry: 'he might be OK...' and the supporting characters.

He is totally brilliant in this role as a man who cannot seem to escape reliving the same day-Groundhog Day-over and over and over again. Watching Murray evolve throughout the movie from realizing he's stuck in the same day, to manipulating his surroundings accordingly, to giving up on life to, finally, softening his attitudes and trying to be the best man he can be and win the love of Andie MacDowell never ever gets old. There are so many memorable scenes you get excited when a favorite is coming up, such as the scene in the diner where he's stuffing his face with pastries.""What if there is no tomorrow, there wasn't one today!""""Well it's Groundhog Day....again.""""Watch that first step. It's a doooooozie.""They cast this movie perfectly. I don't believe another comedian could have brought dead pan humor and dramatic ability quite like Murray. MacDowell was simply perfect as the angelic, optimistic lead actress. If you were in Murray's shoes you'd want to find a way to get to know this beautiful, caring woman better as well. Chris Elliot was great too. For a guy that has taken some heat over the years he can look back on his performance in this movie and be proud. He was funny at the right times but they didn't let his character overdo things.I haven't met many people who don't like Groundhog Day but there is one that comes to mind. She said when she saw it she didn't like how sarcastic Murray is, etc. I helped her see my side of his role and the movie as a whole. Yes, he's Bill Murray and he's being Bill Murray...dead pan, sarcastic stuff and he's a character that is flawed and thinks too much of himself. If that was his character the WHOLE movie I wouldn't like it much either. But the beauty of this movie is that for Murray to find salvation and exit Groundhog Day he must become a better person. He has to shed his ego and his selfishness and become the type of person we all strive to be. My friend rewatched the movie and had a better appreciation for it.Groundhog Day is mandatory watching when it's on tv 24/7 on Groundhog Day. It's a celebration of great comedy and drama and just plain ole laughing at lines that never get old.

385,Dave-79,Simply delightful,10,22 September 1998,"Bill Murray was born to play Phil.  I have never seen him more at ease and natural than in Groundhog Day.  The great thing about this one is it's not just another redemption film where the main character changes his ways based upon one single event. For instance in Good Will Hunting we are led to believe that Will is a whole new person based upon a few counseling sessions. We don't know for sure, but it might have taken Phil years of reliving the same day to get it right.  It's so much fun watching Bill Murray's character change and evolve, and the scene in which he quotes Chekhov is touching and memorable.  Ironically Bill Murray plays the main character in Scrooged, another tale of redemption that couldn't come close to Groundhog Day in terms of originality, script, and imagination. Groundhog day, however, is Bill Murray's best performance to date.",Groundhog Day

I know of no other movie I can say this about. I'm sure I will be watching when I'm 100 years old and by that time It should be close to 300 times I've watched this.Should go down in history as a classic, and I'm not the only one since this movie gets tons of play on TV and continues to draw interest. It proves one thing, writing a good story is what makes a good movie period, adding graphic violence, sex, swearing and huge explosions and stunts with tons of computer effects are all over done today, all we want is a good story that takes us through the movie and makes us feel good at the end. (Not to say sex/violence/swearing and big explosions don't have there place:) I just think they are over done and used too frequently to pull off a movie.funny it's not my favorite movie of all time, but I can watch it more times than any other movie.",Groundhog Day

Living the same day over and over would start being really fun, then get old, then become hell on earth.Bill Murry is great as the self-loving news channel guy, and Andie is equally as wonderful as the level-headed and sweet girl that anyone could fall for. Everything is in place for a happy romance. But this isn't all about romance. This about learning to appreciate each day for being alive and having everything you have.Groundhog Day is perfection from beginning to end.

391,UlrikSander,The ultimate 80's-style comedy!,9,16 July 2006,"GROUNDHOG DAY (1993) continues the tradition of 80's-style comedies such as THE BLUES BROTHERS (1980), GHOSTBUSTERS (1984) and SCROOGED (1988), although there is a major difference. This one is based on an amazing concept, and has much more ambitious, existentialistic themes, almost in the vein of art-house movies, yet without ever feeling pretentious. It manages to be as thought-provoking and clever as movies by Stanley Kubrick, Michael Haneke or Lars von Trier, but it's told in such a light manner that it's much easier to grasp for mainstream audiences. Therefore it's able to almost sneak its themes in on those, who perhaps aren't normally used to thinking about the movies they watch. To me that's a great accomplishment in itself. GROUNDHOG DAY shows how we shouldn't take the important things for granted, that we should make the most of the time we are given on Earth, and that if the world feels like a terrible place, the changes must come from within yourself.It's a movie which different people will interpret different meanings from. It tells the story of Phil Connors (Bill Murray), an arrogant and egocentric TV weatherman, who goes on an assignment in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where he mysteriously gets forced to live through the same day over and over, apparently with no possibility to break the loop. This gives him the opportunity to explore life without consequences. At first he takes advantage of his situation by stealing money, becoming a drunk, and even committing suicide. Yet Phil soon realizes that his hostility towards the world isn't really because of the world, it's because of himself. The lesson is that he must change within to get together with his dream-woman and live happily ever after. Phil is not supposed to make her like him, he's supposed to make himself a likable guy. If you are constantly angry at the world then search within yourself, because that's most likely where the problem exists.GROUNDHOG DAY is Harold Ramis's greatest movie yet. It far exceeds his other comedies, which are funny movies, but without the grandiosity of this one, in terms of the unique idea and themes. Of course Danny Rubin's ingenious manuscript has to receive credits as well, as it is basically the premise of the whole movie. Bill Murray, who is one of my favorite actors, is perfect as the Phil Corners character. Murray is able to express more than thousands of words with his eyes, and his sense of irony is fully exploited. The cameo-roles are full of comedic character-actors such as Chris Elliott, Harold Ramis (the director) and Stephen Tobolowsky. Pure genius! 10/10",Groundhog Day

393,Benjy,Why is there not an Academy Award for comedy?,9,2 February 2000,"It never ceases to baffle me why there is no Award for good comedies. Good comedy is harder to write and perform than almost any other genre and yet great films like Groundhog Day are constantly ignored when the Academy issues it's nominees. It seems that to win, or even be nominated all you have to do is set your drama in the late part of the last century. Among Groundhog Day's 1993 contemporaries are the Piano, Remains of the Day, Schindler's List and Philadelphia. Worthy films all and while there may not be a dry eye in the house for any of them, there surely aren't too many laughs either! Don't get me wrong, you won't guffaw your way through this film in the way you might at say, the Naked Gun films or South Park but it is an excellently scripted and crafted piece by Harold Ramis (famed as Egon in Ghostbusters). Ramis and Murray do appear to have an exceptional working chemistry having also collaborated on the under-rated Stripes waaaay back in the 80s. That chemistry is obvious here as Bill Murray puts in what was at that point arguably his best performance. I'm not an Andie MacDowell fan by any stretch of the imagination but she is well cast here as the prissy producer to Murray's cynical Weatherman.  Also of note is Chris Elliot who you may recognise as Woogie from ""There's something about Mary"". Elliot carries off the part of long suffering and desperate cameraman Larry with some aplomb and I find it a shame that he does not do more work in the film industry, if only so he'd stop doing those awful Baked Tostito's ads!While it certainly didn't deserve to win the 1994 Best Picture Oscar, it could certainly have merited a nomination. Groundhog Day is though very deserving of it's top 250 position on IMDB, although it could justify being a little higher in my opinion. It is over sentimental in parts but that could just be the cynical Brit coming out in me :)",Groundhog Day
394,mreisman,Bill Murray at his best,9,8 May 2000,"I've always liked Bill Murray, especially as the egotistical-but-lovable guy he plays in just about everything he's ever done (but most notably, in Meatballs, Stripes and Ghostbusters).  But he takes it to a higher level in Harold Ramis' ""Groundhog Day,"" owing to a fantastic script which perfectly executes the story's clever premise, and makes perfect use of the Lovable Jerk persona as a springboard for a real character-driven story.  I can't imagine the movie being done with another actor in the lead role, and that is, I think, one of the more remarkable things about it.  Everything, including the casting, fits together so well.The premise of living out the same day over and over again is a very ""high"" concept, but ironically, the story works because the characters are so believable.  Not many comedies would have its hero try to commit suicide over and over again, only to wake up alive, saying, ""Ah, nuts.""Even the usually unbearably bland Andie Macdowell is a three-dimensional, charming and believable foil/love interest.  I credit Ramis and Murray for bringing out the best in her.  While I'm being superlative, let me go on record to say that the film's big comic payoff, when Phil tries to get Rita (Macdowell) into bed through what must be months of conversational scheming, is one of the funniest 15 minutes in film history.I would call this the most underrated comedy of the 90's, if it wasn't on TV so damn much.  But I watch it every time it is, and I still marvel at how close it is to perfection.",Groundhog Day
395,gedhurst,I got you babe!,8,15 August 2014,"Groundhog Day is, first and foremost, a very funny film. Bill Murray plays TV weatherman Phil Connors, an egotistical cynic full of frustrated ambition who, much to his annoyance, finds himself having to broadcast from small-town Punxsutawney PA on the annual ""Groundhog Day"" festival. This is the last thing a big star weatherman like Connors wants to be doing, but in spite of his best efforts to get it over before the incoming storm front, things don't really work out as planned: the big-city sophisticate is forced to live out the same day again and again in a place he really doesn't want to be, Small Town USA, full of hicks from the sticks.The central mystery of the repeating day is never explained. We don't have time to ponder this as the well-paced script moves briskly along, giving Murray the perfect stage to display his deadpan comic talents. The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot as Larry the cameraman. Often, the humour gives way to pathos and some deeply touching (if not to say disturbing) reflections on life, as the perceptive and subtle love story at the heart of the film reveals itself.No matter how many times you see Groundhog Day (it frequently pops up in TV schedules and believe me, you will watch it a lot), you still laugh at the old jokes, notice new jokes that you previously missed, find Andie MacDowell increasingly attractive, Bill Murray funnier and funnier. As time goes by, with each repeated viewing, it is acquiring the mythic charm of something like ""It's a Wonderful Life"", a movie with which it shares some curious thematic parallels. I get the feeling that it really wasn't planned that way, that the project started out as quite an 'ordinary', low budget vehicle for Bill Murray, but somehow had depth and greatness thrust upon it. Again, very much like the story of ""It's a Wonderful Life"".And afterwards that repeating day starts to bother you again. What does it mean? Something about reincarnation? A blueprint for raised consciousness? A biting satire on modern life? Perhaps, as Phil Connors, in his deep, serious mode might say, you realise we are all trapped in our own little versions of Groundhog Day, and if things don't seem to get much better, nor do we get much happier, maybe with a bit of luck, we get a little wiser.",Groundhog Day

It's no wonder that many movies and games these days were inspired by Time Spell, besides being a great movie it's mega fun and original. This film, along with some others, is something that I carry in my heart because not only are they good and they left an impression on me, but also convey a life lesson, even a philosophical one.As the popular saying goes, ""Don't leave tomorrow what can be done today."", furthermore, tomorrow may never exist.",Groundhog Day

In two great movies, Murray rises above that infantile ""finger up yer nose"" stuff and really turns in a complex and brilliant performance, one such is ""What about Bob?"" with Richard Dreyfuss and the other is ""Groundhog Day."" Unlike such lame, childish crap as ""Caddy Shack,"" this is simply one of the funniest movies ever made and proves that, like Jim Carrey, when Bill plays it ""straight,"" he can really shine.

I belive 'Groundhog Day' explores that happiness depends on our capacity to love. There's a spectrum of beauty, and it is effortless to see the beauty at a museum or watch a sunset, but can you see the beauty of everyday life of the most mundane ugly things. To live the greatest life possible is just none other than to see beauty everywhere. Love is a universal property, it's fundamental. It's not a sexual attraction or a romance, therefore, Unconditional love is the absolute acceptance of everything even the bad things. The reason that the universe could say has love is because the universe accepts itself completely without judgement. It's not resisting any part of itself, it loves every piece of itself. It's a love so deep that you can't even imagine what evil is because you love everything so much that there's no more room left for evil to exist.

Most people, if they got a chance to live a day over and over would do the same things as Phil Connors, trying to make things better for themselves. However, this can just lead to rejection and frustration.  Phil eventually realises that life is more rewarding when he gives to others and ends up getting all that he wants.On top of this moral theme, there is brilliant humour.  For example, when he is drunk and driving the car with the two deadbeats.  After they crash the car and are stopped by the cops, they ask for an order of flapjacks.All actors were well suited for the roles (including Phil - the groundhog).

410,pachin,"Bill Murray's greatest movie and one of the greatest comedies, no, one of the great movies of all time.",10,17 November 2003,"Two clues to tell if a movie is great is how often it is copied and how it has become a part of American slang. Groundhog Day has had both happen to it. Warning: POSSIBLE SPOILERS. Bill Murray played Phil Connors, a egocentric and grumpy weatherman in Pennsylvania who goes to Punxsutawny, Pa every year to see if the groundhog sees his shadow for the local television station with his producer, played by the wonderful Andie MacDowell, and his cameraman, played by a low keyed Chris Elliot.Everything goes as Phil expects on the first day, except he is caught in a blizzard and has to stay the night. The next morning he awakes and it's Groundhog Day again! This pattern happens over and over again until he realizes he cannot escape Groundhog Day. In time Phil realizes the advantages of knowing what's going to happen before it happens and Murray takes full comic advantage of it. However if this film was just that, it would be just a normal run of the mill comedy. Murray's character Phil learns and grows and becomes a better person during the course of the film and learns to love the town in which he felt he was trapped in. The chemistry with MacDowell's character of Rita is wonderful. It's a great film and to my mind the best comedy, no perhaps the best movie I have ever seen.",Groundhog Day
411,monkeybone,Stuck in the same day over and over again? Then it must be GROUNDHOG DAY.,9,23 September 2002,"Imagine what it would be like to repeat the worst day of your life over and over again. This is the dilemma for weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who is stuck in the one day of the year he hates the most, Groundhog Day.Set in a small town called Punxatawny, there is an annual event in which a groundhog 'predicts' wether there will be another six weeks of winter or an early spring. Phil Connors has covered this event for three years and is hoping this will be his last but fate seems to have other ideas. Once the festivities are over Connors, cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) start to make their way back to Pittsburgh when they are suddenly hit by a blizzard that Phil had wrongly predicted would pass over them. With the long distance phone lines down and no way out of Punxatawny, Phil is at his wits end as he wants to leave as soon as he possibly can. When he thinks things couldn't get any worse, they do and Phil wakes up to find that he has woken up on February 2nd, Groundhog Day.Directed by Harold Ramis (Stripes, Caddyshack) Groundhog Day is undoubtedly one of the finest comedies to grace the silver screen. With a screenplay that was co-written by Ramis alongside Danny Rubin, the movie never lets up. At first, Connors thinks that he must be in his own personal hell but soon realises that when he wakes up on the third day he can do whatever he wants without any consequences. Even committing suicide doesn't make any difference. Once he finds out that he can't die he turns his attentions to his producer Rita to try and win over her affections.Each day is met with a new twist and turn and for a movie with a concept such as simple as this then someone with a mind for ideas only need apply. There is always something new going on but it only works if you have some great talent working not only behind the camera but in front of it too and that's where Bill Murray comes in. There is not one moment that is dull or boring when Murray is on screen. Every scene turns to gold when he is on screen and there is an immediate chemistry between him and Andie MacDowell.
Ramis has done an absolutely magnificent job in turning such a simple idea into a work of cinematic art. Bill Murray has once again proved he is a comedic talent to be reckoned with and will remain that way for generations to come.",Groundhog Day
412,j1stoner,Funny and deep,9,8 January 2012,"I saw this again after 10 years or more had passed since my last viewing, and my appreciation of it--particularly the writing--grew enormously. I had given it 7 stars back then, but I've upped it to 9.This time around, I see the movie as being about two things: 1) how hard it can be to get laid properly; and 2) the eternal recurrence (see Nietzsche--""Thus Spake Zarathustra,"" and elsewhere). The idea is, we should live our life as though it will be repeated, again and again, forever. If that were true, and we knew it, we would strive to make the day perfect in every way. Then, how much better all our lives would be!Why not 10 of 10, then? What the movie lacks is any self-reflection at all. The ideas are there, but because they are presented in the context of a silly idea, and because Bill Murray's excellent performance--the very essence of character development--proceeds only through crude trial, error, and more trial and error, then it takes us repeated viewings to get the point. Another qualm, somewhat minor, is that the piano teacher whom Bill Murray takes on late in the story somehow takes credit for his miraculous development as a jazz pianist: if she is like all the other characters in the story (except Murray), she has only known him for one day and could hardly think that she had taken him from rank beginner to polished professional performer in a single day. I think that by this point in the story, the writers and audience were both getting a bit weary of painstaking plot and character development and were asked to take on sudden change without question.",Groundhog Day

414,mvanhoore,What would you do if you relive the same day?,7,12 March 2014,"Groundhog Day has a very interesting starting point: What if the whole world relives the same day over and over again and only man notices this? In the movie it seems that Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray) is the only person who relives the 2nd of February over and over again but of course all the people living in small Punxsutawney relive this day. Everything they experience is forgotten the moment that they wake up again when it is the 2nd of February again and also their physical condition is the same as on their wake-up on the day before. Notice that Phil can save lives but if he doesn't interfere the deceased will also wake-up next morning. It is even possible (although we don't see this) that a baby is born over and over again because in the morning he is back in his or hers mama's belly. Or that Phil impregnates a woman (he makes love to at least one woman in the film) and that the fertilized ovum is unimpregnated again when the woman wakes up.Phil Connors is a weatherman who desperately wants to make career steps but without them is forced to do reports on local events like the annual Groundhog Day where an animal predicts if the winter will be long that year. He undergoes a terrible day in Punxsutawney and is extremely annoyed when he is forced to stay one night longer because of a blizzard that he didn't predicted. When his alarm goes off at six o'clock he notices that everything is the same as the day before. During the days his mood changes from confused to indifferent to desperate. He doesn't care for his health anymore because he doesn't get older, fatter or injured. At one point he is so in despair that he tries suicide in many different ways knowing that he will get up next morning in perfect health.In the end he settles for learning activities like chainsaw sculpture and playing the piano. Besides that he tries to seduce his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). At first he tries to impress her by collecting all information from her about things she likes. But one day is not enough and every day he has to start all over again. In the end he tells her the truth and convinces her by showing all the knowledge he has about the town and its inhabitants and predicting all the events happening that day. After spending the night with her he notices a different song from his alarm clock and finally (and without specific reason) it is the 3rd of February.As in all films that play a game with time there are some plot holes. Phil is the only person noticing but Rita makes a hint at one point that she has the feeling that she has a déjà-vu. No reason at all is given why Punxsutawney is in time-loop. It is mentioned in reviews that the reason is for Bill to become a better person and the time-loop stops when he has achieved that. During the film Bill becomes an expert in chainsaw sculpting and a master at the piano. That these talents require also some physical changes (strong muscles and flexible fingers) implicates that some changes of the body don't disappear the next morning. As a viewer I also wondered if the time-loop was bound to Punxsutawney. During the movie there is no mention of contact with the rest of the world and I never saw Phil trying to escape the place before the roads were blocked because of the blizzard.Bill Murray had mentioned that he preferred Groundhog Day to be a more philosophical movie instead of a romantic comedy. I understand that completely. There is a short story by Stephen King where a young boy goes to eternity and is coming out completely mad. Phil doesn't have to go that far but after 10 or 38 years (the time that probably has elapsed before there is a real next day) your mental state would be pretty mixed-up. Director Harold Ramis chose to make another movie and concentrates on the humor (which is outstanding) and the romance between Phil and Rita. And therefore the film looses a lot of his appeal. There's not really chemistry between Murray and MacDowell and the movie is too centered on the character of Phil to let the love story fully develop. But in the end Groundhog Day is an excellent comedy with some philosophical issues that makes you think what you would do when you were in the same situation. Probably watching movies every day and still remember them next day without getting fat because of the chips, popcorn and cola. Only a shame that my reviews on IMDb would be erased when I log in the next day.",Groundhog Day

The whole idea for the movie is superb. To start with it makes you think ""what if"", but by the end it has you thinking a little bit deeper. I mean, there is no real indication of the duration of the characters stay in limbo - has he lived the same day over for a few days, weeks, months, years or centuries? This is just one question of many, in a film lacking (though not really needing) any answers. Then of course there is the casting of Murray. This, along with his Ghostbusters outings, seems to be the perfect role for the guy. He revels in the sarcastic humorist role, but is totally believable when he softens to the effortless charms of McDowell (who also fits her character like a glove). Great film.",Groundhog Day

I don't generally like the romantic/comedy genre, but this movie is an exception.Great character development throughout, solid plot, good casting, great acting and truly original ideas. I loved the variety of ways the main character chooses to live, or rather re-live each day.

However, thanks to Bill Murray's iconoclastic flair and a deeper underlying message to the story, it manages to stay fresh and engaging.How common is it to feel like everyday is just the same as yesterday? Same people, same places, same problems. We can turn to liquor and drunken escapades for some momentary excitement; we can try to take advantage of those around us to gain an edge; we can become despondent and look for an escape. Where does all that get us - nowhere fast. Only by bettering ourselves, learning new skills, becoming helpful to those around us can we truly turn the page on a new day.",Groundhog Day

425,rokomo,3 simple reasons why I love Groundhog Day,8,27 December 2020,"I have seen many unique films such as Fight Club, Inception and Matrix, Groundhog Day is one of these movies. In a 3 lines I will tell why this is a beautiful movie.1. The idea of plot is phenomenal, a weatherman finds himself inexplicably living the same day over and over again. The way he treats this situation fascinates me. First he gets confused, then he gets nervous, then he decides to do anything because nothing will have consequences anyway, then he tries to kill himself, and after that he confides in his producer Rita, but always at 6:00 the same day starts again...2. I was amazed by the last Groundhog Day in the cycle of repetition. Phil helped every person in town because he knew in advance who something bad was going to happen to. I particularly liked the scene where Phil plays the piano and where Rita ""buys"" he. The faces of these people in that scene are so happy and you can see exactly how much Phil has improved since first Groundhog Day.3. Comedy - I wouldn't even comment on excellence because Bill Murray plays in this movie.Must watch.",Groundhog Day
426,popopon0125,Good Comedy,8,23 August 2015,"This is a comedy about a man, who is a popular weather forecaster. In the film, first, he goes to a country town to report ""Groundhog Day."" Second, he notices he spends the exact same day over and over. Finally, he decides to make use of the situation to be a respectable person. I feel it is funny that the man fails to make advances to the heroine over and over. Taking the ending into consideration, we can understand she doesn't like his self-centered attitude. In contrast, I don't like the scene the man tries to kill himself. This is because I wonder whether he really needs to do such a thing. In my opinion, the director can show his feelings by using another way. Anyway, I really enjoyed watching this film throughout the whole. Therefore, I recommend every people to watch it. The structure of the film is simple and easy to understand, so I think every people would enjoy watching this film.",Groundhog Day

He has to repeat the same day, groundhog day, again and again. I think his character is very interesting. He is really egocentric and cannot be honest with himself at first.

428,royals794,Thought-provoking and hilarious,10,23 October 2008,"If you don't think that Bill Murray is one of the funniest men on the planet, then you clearly haven't seen Groundhog Day. Murray owns the screen from beginning to end of this marvelous film, and I mean he owns it. Obviously the Academy Awards don't actually care about honoring great film, regardless of genre, because this is clearly one of the best films of 1993, the 1990's as a whole, and also of all time.Murray plays Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman sent to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania. His one-day trip turns into a never-ending cycle, as Phil gets caught in a time warp that causes him to relive the same day over and over again. Phil is stuck in Punxsatawney for a seemingly endless amount of time; each day, he wakes up in the same Bed and Breakfast and nobody else remembers a thing about all the days he's lived. We follow Phil through several emotional stages, ranging from confusion to terror to joy to despair and ultimately to real happiness.Groundhog Day is one of the most original comedies I've ever seen. The plot has been repeated on television shows several times since (and perhaps the idea had been filmed beforehand, I'm not sure), but never has it been as perfectly crafted as it is here. Groundhog Day is both funny and realistic, (as realistic as a time-warp movie can be) and Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role. Andie McDowell is also very good as Rita, Phil's co-worker and eventual love interest.Groundhog Day is essentially a comedy, but it is also deeply thought-provoking, and makes you consider how you live your life. Phil starts out as a selfish, cynical man and slowly changes into a considerate, helpful individual who truly cares about others. As we watch him transform into a better person, we laugh a whole lot at the situations he gets into- but we hopefully emerge from it all like him, a changed man for the better. Groundhog Day is a brilliant piece of film-making and should be watched by everybody (preferably every Groundhog Day, which is February 2nd).",Groundhog Day
429,Sherlemious,This makes my heart... warm?,8,4 February 2021,"I've previously watched many ""Groundhog Day"" movies like ; Edge of Tomorrow, Happy death day and Happy death day 2u, 1000 Congratulations (Egyptian movie), and Ghosts of War. It wasn't up until recently that I watched ""the"" Groundhog Day, and all I think right now is why have I not watched this earlier? It's been a long while now since I watched a movie that felt... natural? I think the actors on set have really great chemistry going on. I don't know how but it just works, and I'm really glad it does. Because if it didn't, I wouldn't have been feeling empty right now; empty because I don't get to live an alternative life for more than a hundred minutes.
The jokes were kind of the thing I'd expect from a character like Phil, which is perfect to be honest as the characters just comes across easily. I find it hard to laugh on all the recent ""comedy"" movies, and I didn't on this one too, but I smiled, I just smiled in awe and lived the day over and over again with Phil. It felt... real? It was beautiful how I was indulged into it like I was seeing it from Phil's point of view? It was good, It was perfect. I thought the point they wanted to make in the movie was gonna be forced, but I really got it. I do get it and I smiled through the whole final 20 minutes of this.

He finds himself trapped in a weird cycle: every morning he wakes up on the same day! But he's the only one who relives the day, for the rest it's all new. Little by little he learns about all the people; who they are, what they do, what makes them tick... At first, he uses this information to his benefit, thinking he can get away with anything, since nothing has consequences he reckons. He lives like there's no tomorrow, which is actually true. Using trial & error he gets almost everything he wants, except for one thing: the affection of his producer Rita. No matter how hard he tries, she won't give in...

This is one of several films from the 1990s that counterbalanced the cynicism of that decade with a reminder that there were some important things in life and that we need to review our priorities.For me this is a classic film, especially for the holidays, which balanced drama and comedy and yes even some practical philosophy and made for a perfect story.

436,hellaszer,One the best movies of all times - on a comical level,10,17 March 2012,"I must admit this movie was one of my favorites when I was a teenager. I'm just watching it again, and I felt it necessary to review this film, as the effect has not only not faded away, but actually made the jokes more powerful - as I grasp on them differently, more fully. Bill Murry's jerk character is so hilarious and original, and his lines are so funny that you cannot resist liking him. On the other hand Andy's angelic, curly haired, innocent face opposes this brut.I think one of the smartest ideas is that the setting is pure and simple: it could be anywhere BUT nowhere important. Of course, it is important for our character to get stuck in the middle of nowhere - as of course it wouldn't come as a curse to spend every day on a nice island or a big city. Here monotomy hits us hard. And here comes the maturity: people in their 30s, 40s can easily get the metaphor: that 'every day looks the same'. We work, sleep, eat, .... and what else? Something is missing, right? It takes an eternity to realize that there are more important things, human relations, remembering who we are, what makes us happy - and the full capacity of love. This deeper message is nicely wrapped in a funny storytelling, and even more hilarious actions. I don't think we have to simplify it for a ""bad"" man becoming ""good"", more virtous, but rather waking up from his own 'groundhog' sleep, a sleep in which he has been spending most of his life....Have fun, and don't be afraid of your own shadow:)",Groundhog Day

438,Jamespc96,A JPC Recommendation,10,19 November 2014,"Groundhog Day is my favorite film because it deals with every aspect of life. You know you've felt like it's the same thing everyday before. You wake up, go to school or work, usual usual, come home to usual usual. You can abuse this, make a joke of it, kill some people, or help some people. Depending on how you approach it is what this day is actually about. The story is not so seemingly deep or preachy in the film as I may make it out because it is also entertainment which is how things should be looked back on. The worst experience is the most experience. Bill Murray's deadpan sarcasm adds to the amusement of this experience. I give the film ten stars because only a few films anymore leave an impression on me in a certain way. You see so many films and you get so bored and down with everyday sometimes you need to watch some douche deal with the same problem only in this film it's literal. A JPC recommendation goes to any film that leaves an actual impression on me where most others did not. This ones amusing, sad with a sarcastic main character, with romance, and about a holiday that nobody cares for. If there was ever a film about having a positive attitude this one I recommend.",Groundhog Day

He learns that by developing his artistic side he will learn to love and be loved. He learns to sculpt and play the piano beautifully. And, it seems to me, finally, that he chooses to do it for the right reasons: the pure joy of expression, the pleasure of bringing beauty and truth to the world. My wife asked me in wonder how I could love this flick so much; it's so unrealistic. But, ah, the theme is so strong that I want to suspend my disbelief. It functions ultimately as an allegory.

455,phonenumberofthebeast,A simple tale that conceals surprising depth and meaning,10,19 October 2012,"""Groundhog Day"" is a rare case of audiences actually being ahead of the critics. When this superficially simple tale of a self-obsessed weatherman (Bill Murray) who is forced to relive the same day over and over again was initially released, most critics, even the best, completely missed this movie's subtle and intricate take on the vagaries of life. They followed only its simple premise, slapstick humour and the great, sarcastic shadow of Bill Murray, who, as always, dominates every scene. Audiences, however, immediately took to it. Despite being released (appropriately) in February, the famine period of the movie calendar, ""Groundhog Day"" went on to gross over $70 million and became a sleeper hit later on video. Soon, the phrase ""It's like Groundhog Day"" began passing from mouth to mouth as a descriptor for any number of human situations, and Groundhog Day was better recognised as a metaphor than as a holiday. Today, ""Groundhog Day"" is recognised by the AFI and the Writer's Guild of America. That ""Groundhog Day"" works on all the levels it does is not necessarily due to conscious action on the part of the writers (Harold Ramis and John Rubin), who focus primarily on delivering a sharp and witty script that fully explores every comic (and later, tragic) outcome of its premise, but because its premise, so utterly simple, is also marvelously applicable to an almost endless array of life experiences. In that sense, it is like a fairy tale or a myth: a universal story that manages to capture something essential in the human experience. For example, there is very little overt religious symbolism in the film, and yet representatives of several entirely different religions have drawn parallels between the story and the tenets of their faith. Buddhists see Murray's character's dilemma as a representation of the cycle of rebirth, while Catholics see it as Purgatory. In truth, as the film itself notes, *everyone* feels trapped in an endlessly repeating cycle of identical days for at least part of their lives, and so is free to read it as applies to them. Beyond this though, it really is quite astounding how perfect this little film is; how annoying characters we wouldn't give the time of day to in the street suddenly become fully fleshed out comic creations, simply because we took the time to see them properly. How every bland suburban street reveals turn-of-the-century architectural gems that our eyes would have passed over on first viewing, and how beautiful the sky can look on a cold February morning.",Groundhog Day

Unlikely. So the movie is an exercise in envy as the jerk gets a chance to un-jerk his life - no, even just one day of his jerky life. This movie was itself created from 10,000 cycles of filming.

You just have to pay close attention and consider how one movie under two hours manages to capture everything from Buddhist enlightenment to dating to the nature of self-hatred, self-love, snobbery, and kindness. You'll never learn how Phil Connors gets trapped in time and comes to fear his own shadow. But you don't need to know that.You'll see something new each time you watch it.

459,spacefoo,Uplifting and truly unique,10,24 May 2007,"There are few films in which you can watch and genuinely feel uplifted and can make you feel like every day is important...this is one of them. A truly special film. It follows Phil Conners (Bill Murray) a TV weatherman man who pretty much hates his life, and the world around him- he's cold, and drips sarcasm and dry humour and no one really knows him. But its not one of those yawn inducing romance movies, where the bad man turns good because of love instantly- this is a much smarter movie, the premise is unique as Phil aims to get his report over with, in Punxatawney to cover the groundhog day, as quickly as possible and get out. He can't stand the town, and finds the whole day utterly pointless. Thus the groundhog day commences at 6am and his radio alarm awakes him to two radio presenters ""Its groundhog day..."" after the quirky ceremony he tries to get out of town but his own weather report lets him down as the storm forces him to stay another day. What he doesn't realise is this is a day he may have to re-live for the rest of his life. He awakes to exactly the same day and events as the previous one- and continues to do so. From this point on Phil goes through many stages: At first he treats the repeated days with contempt; then he continues his personality of dry ego-centric and impersonal, by using it to his advantage- by picking up women rather impressively i might add, living it with reckless abandon with the realisation there are no consequences stealing,arrested; then the next stage was that of being suicidal- as he commits suicide every day as this repeated day was a curse; however as the movie develops so too does his interest in the sweet good natured Rita Andie McDowell character, whom he woos and romances and he uses each day to develop his knowledge of her. He gets a lot of slaps in the face as he attempts to use it to bed her in one go; but this soon gives him a reason to keep going, and he over time develops an excitement in his life and re-living it as he starts doing good in the community helping people and sculpturing and playing and instrument and his nature changes to one of good... and he finally gets groundhog day right- it all comes together for him and he gets his girl, and he feels genuinely uplifted as he awakes the next day with Rita beside him and he finally made it to the next day.Themes wise, there is a distinct religious overtone- almost Buddhist in its philosophy.The conclusion makes the viewer realise that every day should be cherished, by living one through the eyes of a man we can all relate too. What would you do with having to relive the same day over and over? in many ways we'd probably all go through the stages that Bill Murray does. Personally i can relate to the metaphorical idea that you live the same day in the same town when nothing really matters, this movie takes that in a literal sense which is unique- and finds an uplifting way to change Phil Conners character. In terms of comedy, this is undoubtedly in my opinion Bill Murray's finest achievement he is a wonderfully skilled comedic actor but he is given a script he can run riot with as he makes the character his own in his fantastic Murray way. His facial expressions, his dry humour-- some of the moments in this movie are just fantastic, it makes you laugh out loud, but it also makes you feel heart-warmed and carries a strong message. Harold Ramis does a fantastic job of directing in this movie also...all in all i feel this could possibly be one of the underrated gems of all time.",Groundhog Day

I completely agree with another reviewer who said that this is one of the most underrated films of all time. The basic premise seems ridiculous - Phil, an unsavoury, ambitious weather reporter living his least favourite day of the year over and over again and is the only person aware of it. There's no explanation for it, it's just happening. But the explanation is not needed for the film-goer - our treat is to live the predicament with Phil, to watch him try everything he can think of to get to tomorrow. The script is wonderfully tight, with no duff jokes and Bill Murray gives his best performance ever - his attempts to seduce Andie MacDowell have got to be seen to believed...hilarious! The ending is 'feel good' epitomised, but not sickening in any way. I'm going to stick my neck out and say that it is nearly impossible to dislike this film (I'm sure some hard-hearted person will somehow hate it)...a must see...",Groundhog Day

Murray plays a weather reporter who wakes up on the same day in a boring town over and over. When the situation becomes a chance the film moves from straight comedy to romantic comedy without a problem. A totally round story, an sensible direction and a nice casting with a fabulous Bill Murray playing his character with a touch of cinisism that never lets the film become corny, and one of the best screenplay that I've ever seen, are the ingredients that makes this film a jewel.

A new idea, a comment on our humanity, a metaphor for our lives, and we're not scolded about our failings, we're allowed to laugh as we learn - what were the critics thinking about with their ho hum reviews?The plot? Bill Murray is a conceited and arrogant Pittsburgh weatherman doomed for all eternity to repeat February 2 in boring Punxatawnie, PA over and over again. At least until he gets it right. What's right? Murray finds out the hard way, and you'll have a delightful trip learning with him. And you might discover something about yourself along the way.Murray is the only person alive who could have pulled off the lead role, and Andie McDowell plays the innocent foil just perfectly. The setting in Punxatawnie is cleverly broadly American. Critic Roger Ebert recently asked why we see no movies about small town Americans who are as lovable and eccentric as those in certain Irish and English settings such as ""Waking Ned Divine.""  Well here it is Ebert, the characters and the actors portraying them are as eccentric and lovable as they come.

The story, that a man has to relive the same day over and over makes for a great movie. Of course, casting Bill Murray helped the film-he delivered the lines with the correct facial expressions and air. I thought it was good that the film started Murray off as a somewhat bitter(or mean)weather man who thinks he is a celebrity. Phil Connors treats everyone as if they are there to do his bidding. The trip to Punxsawtawnee changes Phil's life and his perception of life.I really liked the way the film developed the story. Every day that passes (even though each passing day is the same day)changes Phil. At first he is in disbelief; then he is awed at the things he can get away with (mostly theft);then he is desperate to end his misery;and then finally, he tries to use his situation to better the life of the people in Punxsawtawnee.

Phil is initially a rather tragic man, lonesome and unhappy with his life, which shows in his satiric and disrespectful attitude towards people. This is also the case with his work, for instance when he must cover the festivities around the groundhog day in the small town Punxsutawney. But fate has had enough, and an unexpected snow blizzard forces Phil and his camerateam to stay one more night in town. The next day, Phil experiences deja vu: he's stuck in yesterday! From now on, he goes through a series of transformations, ranging from bliss, to megalomania, to utter despair, to resignation, and finally: empathy.Bill Murray's contribution to this movie is immense. His mimic and body language alone is enough to make you laugh, and a wonderful script is the icing on the cake.

This is ironic as one of his most celebrated movies, It's a Wonderful Life was also hugely underrated in its day and in fact was slated by some critics. The difference between these films is that Harold Ramis is not held in the same esteem as Frank Capra, at least not at present. In order for that to happen Harold will need to make a film of the same acclaim as 'Mr Smith goes to Washington'. Things could easily change.Meanwhile 'Groundhog Day is an impressive use of imagination (whilst not perfect) and is one of those 'what if...' wonderfully quirky movies that you find yourselves talking and debating far more than even the most profoundly philosophical of deep thought provoking epics. Pure escapist fun and for once that does not mean some sci fi big budget action blaster.Then there are the performances mostly good solid ones with a glorious subtle piece of acting from Murray, probably his best to date.I could go on but I do not wish to hype it too much for those who have not seen it.

Bill Murray is forced to relive the same day and he only moves on when he discovers the compassionate side of himself and stops being selfish.

475,Vultural,The film that defies its genre,9,30 June 2009,"Up until now Groundhog Day was one of the few films in IMDb's top 250 that i hadn't had the pleasure of watching, mainly due to the fact that it is often perceived to belong in the Rom-com genre. As this genre in my view produces some of the most torrid films i have ever seen i decided to leave the film for a very long time.On viewing the film i would first like to say that it doesn't belong in the Rom-com genre. Yes it has Romance and yes it is the the driving force behind the film's conclusion, but for the most part the film's narrative doesn't concentrate on this romance. Instead this is a film about how Phil(Bill Murray), and i hate to be clichéd, discovers himself. This is why i would be inclined to call Groundhog day a comedy.On to the review. Honestly when i look at comedy films i don't take into account it's 'artistic' merit, e.g. the direction or cinematography. Instead i find that when watching comedy films the plot and jokes should be the main focus.Groudhog Day's success mainly comes down to two factors, the first is it's plot. Being a completely inspired idea it would have been very hard to make a film that wasn't funny. The execution however was perfect which managed to harvest every bit of humour it could from the situation Phil is put into.The second reason for the success of the film can be put down to the brilliance of the acting, in particular in reference to Bill Murray, who is on better form than ever (and that is a high standard). Thanks to Murray i found myself connecting to the character like never before in a comedy, adding to the effect of the humour.Overall Grounhog day is an almost perfect film which fractionally misses out on the title of best comedy ever.9/10",Groundhog Day

How many days must have passed to change Bill Murray's character? (Trick question - the answer is ""One"".) The endless playing out, like variations on a theme, take us and the character far from the starting point. There are Faustian parallels here. Faust was not free until he was able to say ""Stay for thou art fair"",just as Groundhog day will recur until the errant weatherman realises that this day is perfect (better than that day in the Bahamas that he would have originally preferred.)And how refreshing it is not to have some glib ""explanation"" offered as to why this happened.

The chemistry between them was fun and exciting, and the cast of unusual characters from small town USA added greatly to the humor of the situation. The premise of the story was almost believable in a happily ever after kind of world.

480,jonnyabomb,"Funny, deeply moving and original!",8,19 March 2005,"I wonder what Bill Murray made of this script when it landed on his doorstep. Surely it was going to be a winner as the Murray/Ramis partnership had been one that had bared fruit on a number of occasions already with titles such as Caddyshack, stripes and Ghostbusters all lodged firmly in the minds of movie goers as classic Murray fests. However, I sincerely doubt that he could have ever envisioned the success and popularity that this tale of a local weatherman reliving the same day over and over would go on to achieve at the box office and with fans alike. Murray is the best in the business at world weary cynicism and Phil Connors trial by time is at heart a simple story of a man forced to realise that in a place where nothing changes but himself that this is the only difference that truly matters. The Director Ramis claims to have received letters from people of all religions who have seen this movie and understand the message as one of their own following. In essence this is much more than a simple comedy and as Connors himself reminds us not to underestimate the significance of Groundhog Day.However I would never like to deter anyone from seeing this film on the basis that it may be too convoluted in its message. Every scene is packed with hilarious antics and typically astute Murray one liners. The film is brilliantly cast and Andie Macdowells's innocence and integrity provide a useful contrast to Murray's downbeat yet brilliant humour. She represents the ultimate female companion for Connors and gives the film its real heart as she is the person to which he attains to. There's something quite tragic about reaching out to someone and never being able to have that affection returned. The idea of human loneliness was dealt with great elegance in arguably Murray's finest work 'Lost in Translation' but the comic element of Groundhog Day does not detract from the similar pathos we feel for his isolation in a world where he can touch but never change. This movie has something for everyone. If you're after a deep message, a great love story or are just looking to laugh your ass off then this will be a winner on all fronts.",Groundhog Day

The movie also poses a profound question: What would you do if none of your actions will have any consequences tomorrow? Would you be the worst of yourself? Or would you be the best of yourself? Would you become frustrated because you know nothing good will last, or would you be filled with confidence that you can really do the best you can because you won't be afraid to try everything?Is the glass half-empty or half-full?

Phil's curse is a repetitious day that starts over the same every morning at 6:00 AM - regardless of his actions the ""day before"".  He alone remembers that it has already occurred.  At first he is clever -- using the situation for personal gain.  He finds out facts about pretty girls on day one, then uses these facts to endear himself to them on day 2.  He robs the armored car truck during the few seconds he knows it is going to be unguarded.  The novelty pales.  Unsatisfied, he becomes more desperate and apathetic. Finally, he realizes that the only way to find true satisfaction is to improve himself, help others, and try to do the world some good instead of trying to figure out what he can get from it.  When he finally lives a day to perfection, the spell breaks and his life falls into place.  It's inspiring, it's hilarious, and it's so intriguing you won't want it to end.

484,diakonia_alpha,A brilliant comedy/morality tale,10,12 February 2000,"Groundhog Day is undoubtedly one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I will admit by bias.  I think Bill Murray is a comic genius, which is on display in full force in this comic tour de force.Bill Murray plays a disgruntled meteorologist who works for a small-market TV station.  He is embarrassed that he still has to do gigs like the local groundhog festival in a smalltown.  As it happens, the last place that Murray wants to be is the place where he must remain.  He wakes up the morning after to discover that he is reliving the previous day.  With each passing day (the same day that is), Murray realizes that there are no rules for him because each day he is given a second chance.  No rules means no consequences.  He attempts to woo the luminous Andie MacDowell(in her best role), but after repeated failures, he starts killing himself off.  This is the darkly comic part of the movie, especially the kidnapping of Phil the groundhog.I will not spoil the ending, but suffice it to say, it is not disappointing. Murray realizes the meaning of life is not about self; it's about selflessness.  Point being: we live dead-end lives when we live them in selfishness.  We can only escape when we learn to be compassionate, and we can't be loved until we learn to love others ourselves.This is more than mindless entertainment to me.  It is truly an uplifting story, not to mention the fact that it is one of the most romantic movies I've seen.  Without a doubt, Bill Murray is one of our best and most under-appreciated actors.

One of the most important messages I see is that you should live everyday as if it where your last. It sounds corny I know but bare with me. The character may repeat the same day over and over, but the fact remains that everything he accomplishes, he does so in a single day. In a single day he manages to save lives and make himself loved by everyone. At the end of the movie I am left with a warm feeling. If Phil who started out as a hated and lonely man could turn his live around in (essentially) a single day, then image what I could do.....This makes Groundhog day one my favorite movies ever.

487,spgorelick,Sublime,10,9 February 2009,"This disarming film seems so simple and innocuous on the surface, and yet it is exceptionally smart, clever and meaningful. Who would have thought that Harold Ramis, crown prince of the slob comedy, and Bill Murray, an actor whose specialty is looking disinterested, would combine to create a work of this caliber? ""Groundhog Day"" eschews cheap laughs and throwaway gags for something much richer, deeper and more sophisticated. The idea of someone living the same day over and over again, until he finally gets it right, is absolutely ingenious. The transformation of this character in the process is a revelation and a joy to watch. ""Groundhog Day"" is truly sublime, one of the best motion picture comedies ever.",Groundhog Day
488,mtiller12,The best 90's comedy,8,5 July 2003,"Groundhog Day is the best comedy of the 90's and I feel was overlooked at the Oscars in a way. The story is that of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has arrived in a small town to cover the Groundhog festival with his producer Rita (Andie McDowell) and camera man Larry (Chris Elliot). But when he must stay in the town for the night, he wakes up at in the previous day and it does so, again and again. This movie has the ultimate gag of all time with the concept of living a day for the rest of your life, it is used with great effect and Harold Ramis the director sets up very neat scenarios and does a time warp of the situations he is in but in different days. Bill Murray is in his prime here and Phil Connors is one of his best characters and his portrayl deserved perhaps a nomination, if Kline got one for A Fish Called Wanda then Murray should have recieved one. The sarcasm of Phil is great and the first cover of the festival is some of the most funny sarcasm I have ever seen. It is a shame that Murray doesn't sometimes write his characters dialogue, because he can handle the use  of sarcasm to the best comedic possibilities. There is one scene in the movie which he improvised, Ned comes up to him and instead of being a wise ass he hugs him, Ned is shaken and while hugging, Murray comes up with... ""I don't know where you're heading, but, can you call in work sick."" Ned obliges politley and runs away, Murray is right on par here in some of his best work. McDowell and Elliot are good too providing solid support but the movie truly belongs to Murray. The two category's this should have been nominated for at the Academy was Best Screenplay and Best Actor, overlooked without a doubt. This film is a very intelligent film, it has such spiritual foundations that it is feel good and also you come away with something new to your life. If you want an intelligent, romantic, fun, hilarious movie, with the best Bill Murray sarcasm, than watch Groundhog Day. When you watch you will want to watch it again, and again, and again...",Groundhog Day

Phil is a prima donna, just like his cameraman Larry notes: and even though he suffers many deaths and indignities as he cycles through that day over and over, his reward is the prima donna's fondest dream come true: He is the best at all he attempts: piano playing, ice statue carving, first aid hero, getting the girl, etc. An egomaniac's festival, which put a bitter edge on this comedy, which is not at all a bad thing.

But this film, despite plenty of praise and encouragement from my father just was a little boring for me. I mean I get that not many are going to love this review and no film has ever been loved by everyone but I honestly don't understand the colt following of this.The filmed looked aged even for its time. The acting seemed to be half delivered. The cinematography was very basic and the soundtrack a lot of the time didn't match the scenes. I found myself watching it all only to not offend my dad. The character development of Phil (Bill Murray) was verybpredicable and the love connection seemed to forget that this was over the course of one day plus I don't think that Rita's (Andie MacDowell)character from the start was very much like what she was come the end which doesn't make sense in this particular scenario.However I did enjoy the insanity and suicide montage it was by far the funniest part.

499,mogens_høegsberg,Great Bill Murray comedy,8,4 December 1999,"The insane idea of having Bill Murray play a tv-weatherman who has to go to a small backwater town to cover the appearance of the Groundhog makes for some excellent laughs in this Harold Ramis/Bill Murray-comedy.Bill Murray obviously enjoys himself playing cynical weatherman Phil Connors and it is without a doubt Murray's dry, cynical performance that saves Groundhog Day from being just another Hollywood comedy.The underlying morality of the movie to me seems a bit over the top. Far from disliking movies with a message, at times it was simply a bit too moralizing. I definitely watch this movie for the excellent performance by Murray, and others should as well. If they get a kick out of the moralizing undercurrent it's just great - I just don't dig it that much (but yes - I *do* agree with the message of the movie!)..",Groundhog Day

I think this one the best comedy of the 90s not only for the Brilliant performance of Bill Murray (absolutely perfect in this role)but in particular for the deeper meaning of the story. In fact Phil's life is a disaster he's selfish,presumptuous, cinic and only when he changes his nature,stopping to use this absurd situation for his goals ,things will be better for him and the 2nd of February finally will be the 3rd!.So knowing perfectly the things of the day he's forced to live ever he starts helping people : save a child who's falling form a tree,save a man hit by an heart attack and so on in this way he also conquest the woman of his dreams (Andy McDowell).So this film is  a metaphor.Each of us after all live always the same day (wake at the same time,make the same job,see the same people)without realizing it,maybe we should make like Phil and try to change ,even just a bit,to be better person and to feel better ,is it so difficult ?..",Groundhog Day

I am going to make it a point to watch this film every Groundhog Day from now on.One thing that I always wondered when watching this film was how long Phil actually repeats the same day. By the end of the movie he is a classical pianist, physician, ice sculptor, etc... When watching the DVD extras you find out that in the original screenplay Phil repeats the same day over 1000 years!

I've never seen a movie like it.  Possibly due to the fact that a plot like this only works once and Groundhog day, to my knowledge, took full advantage of it.The actor playing the main character must be good in order for a movie to have any chance, even with good support cast and director;  in this movie, Bill Murray did a sensational job convincing me.  His Mannerisms were flawless throughout the movie, as he evolved throughout the day repeating itself over and over.Bill Murray, the plot, the support cast keeps you in to the movie all the way.  It's nice to know that the suspence doesn't build as much as more dramatic movies do, rather it starts rather quickly in the movie and just doesn't stop until the conclusion.Who sais a plot has to go with the laws of science?

505,Tenenbaum21,Bill Murray's best film. HILARIOUS!,10,26 September 2002,"Groundhog Day is of the funniest movies ever released or even remotely thought up of by cinema makers. Bill Murray is at his greatest with outstanding lines of sarcastic replies and obvious insults to whoever his victim may be. Harold Ramis wrote and directed this film, as he has so many other fine pieces of film. Ramis also had a small role as a doctor in this film. Andie McDowel had a key role in this movie as the woman Murray's character is in love with. I usually find McDowel's accent and her acting quite annoying, but this is one of her better films. Saturday Night Live's Chris Elliott had a supporting role as ""Larry"" and he played his part very well. I believed he was better than Andie McDowel in some certain points. There is nothing that is not funny about this very entertaining film. Groundhog Day is about one man's experience through a day of hell that will never end- Groundhog Day. He tries to shoot,electrocute,stap,get run over by a Semi truck, but he always wakes up on one day- Groundhog Day. The ""Academy"" failed to award an outstanding film the awards it deserved. Groundhog Day is a film that all should experience. Bill Murray will definitely make you laugh. I would highly recommend that you rent this film because it is a highly wonderful piece of entertainment that all will enjoy!",Groundhog Day
506,cmqp,A totally flawless movie,10,18 March 2003,"It's hard not to adore this film. I've seen it so many times I can speak along with the dialogue virtually throughout, but it loses none of its magic. Can there really be anyone left who hasn't heard the premise of this movie? If you are that person, then here it is: grumpy prima donna weatherman (Bill Murray), frustrated by being stuck on local news, is sent with his sexy new producer (Andie MacDowell) and irritating cameraman (Chris Elliot) to the backwater of all backwaters, Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania. Why? Because that's the centre of the Groundhog Day festival where, every February 2nd, America waits to see if there will be six more weeks of winter. Murray is bored and fed up after being sent to cover the story, but his distress only escalates when he realises he is stuck in Groundhog Day every day. No matter what he does, at 6am every morning he is back in his bed listening to Sonny and Cher. This movie, while definitively romantic in places, is always, always imaginative. We follow Murray's character through depression at his time warp existence, joy at the fact he can do anything including steal thousands of dollars, determination when he realises that he can get to know MacDowell's Rita without her sensing his ulterior motives, and desolation again when he understands the meaninglessness of a life devoted to himself.Although that all sounds kind of deep, the film is a total joy from start to finish, and you never realise you're being exposed to hardcore philosophical concepts as you see Murray scoffing cake in a diner. Enough laugh-out-loud moments to make this a comedy classic, Groundhog Day also has thoughtful and intelligent subtexts, which make it worth watching dozens of times. Fabulous entertainment.",Groundhog Day

Given the pandemic and stay at home orders I could better relate to this. Every day he needs to build relationships again as no-one remembers him. He even seems a little sad as he makes his rounds saving people.Instead of a movie that I forget pretty much before the credits were finished I've found myself thinking about it. It really is much deeper than I've picked up on before.",Groundhog Day
508,d-cappella,Surprisingly good film which gets one thinking,10,30 January 2010,"I have never seen a film that so encapsulates the value of our inner self given that time no longer matters. As Bill Murray lives the same day over and over, we learn that given eternity, the only factor that will change is the person experiencing eternity. We see this through him learning French, the piano, ice sculpting. But I think more intriguing than that is the way Phil learns about the people in the small town. I was incredibly impressed by the scene in which he points out several townspeople and tells their stories. Eternity isn't just about one person, but about finding out about everyone else too.I was also intrigued by the small comparison that was made to God. Obviously Phil was nowhere near divinity, but in one aspect I think the movie approached it - the idea of God outside time. Since Phil could just live the same day over and over, he could really get to know every single person in the town, he could figure out what they needed most at certain times and provide help in the best way he could. In a way, this is an incredible insight into the nature of God, and for Christians it is rather exciting since we believe that every day for God is like Phil's day - lasting for an eternity and in that eternity God can give each of us his own personal treatment and help us out when we most need it. Sorry if that sounds a little overly religious, but it really is what attracted me the most to the film.Finally, the film leaves us with the perfect blueprint of how to live life - as if it were to last for an eternity (and for Christians this is true). This means getting to know people and also changing ourselves for the better over time - not superficially like the weather.",Groundhog Day

Every time they show it on TV, I somehow end up glued to the screen. No winter is perfect without at least one viewing of this lovely winter tale. Although it's not about Christmas, it has this very X-masy feel about it. The way Bill Murray plays the cynic is great, and it is very moving (and funny at the same time) to watch how he gradually gets purified by his ordeal, until by the end he is ethically almost ""superhuman"". Also it is so funny because you know what's going to come next and you can't wait to see how he tries out different ways of dealing with the same situation. Although there never is an explanation about why and how the repetition of this one day comes about, it is obvious from the way the movie ends that God (or someone else up there who wants us to become good people) takes a hand in this. Of course there are a few things in the plot that can't stand up under scrutiny (people seem to remember things they shouldn't) - but that is not the point.This is entertainment at its best. 10/10.",Groundhog Day
510,SwordofFire,I'm watching and writing about this right now!,8,1 January 2005,"Groundhog Day is a glorious film that gives a hilarious and sometimes bleak view of what would happen if you had to live one day over and over. It's funny and enjoyable, and while it's greatness is different to, say, Citizen Kane or star Wars, it remains the best temporal displacement comedy (if not movie), and is one of the best romantic comedies. Murray is excellent as Phil, the disenfranchised, broken down, sarcastic weather man who finds himself going over groundhog day eternally. He is perfectly cast, and proves once again why he is one of the best comics who has ever lived. His deadpan face and sarcastic nature are used to full fury, and he is aided by a great supporting cast, including Andie McDowell in one of her not crap roles, and Steven Tobolowsky, who plays the hilariously annoying Ned Ryerson.

Basically Bill Muray's character is forced into introspection and growth because the only element of his existence he is able to permanently change is himself. Murray is pretty good at this type of metamorphosis (see ""Scrooged""). While placing characters in situations that encourage or stimulate personal growth is common movie fare, the way it is accomplished here is really unique. In a world of so many copy-cat stories and variations on a theme this movie is brilliantly original.

Wake up, go to work, come back home, same next day. Isn't it everyday Groundhog Day?Well, this movie converts a philosophical dilemma into a superb romantic comedy. Bill Murray proves he is not just a common funnyman. I would consider his play in Groundhog Day his best role, and director Harold Ramis best work.

Every time I watch this, it brings me back to the innocence and charm that only films in the 90s seemed to have. Other films which contained this magic are ones like Mrs Doubtfire and Hook. Every time I watch this movie, I always imagined what it would be like to live in this nice small tight-knit community.The film explores most of the possibilities on how you would take advantage of being able to re-live the same day over and over again. But also the caulse where you can't kill yourself to escape it. The film offers a strong moral at the end of it which is, be nice to people and live every day to its fullest.The fact that the writers don't explain why the timeloop occurs just adds to the mystery and is definitely one of those moments where it's best not to explain it. I think thats the problem of films today, everything has to be spelt out with an explanation. Sometimes it's best for the viewer to make up their own mind.Overall a great film, I wish Harold Ramis still made films. Bill Murray's well timed humour is what really drives this film, and it's this film that made me fall in love with this actor. It's a good, wellrounded, family film.",Groundhog Day
516,ferris512,My Favorite Comedy Ever!,10,6 December 2000,"What makes Groundhog Day special is that it is not only philosophically deeper than most movies, but also socially relevant.  How many people in this world have often felt like they're living the same day over and over again?  So many that Groundhog Day has now become a synonym for a monotonous lifestyle.  People can often be heard saying, ""I feel like I'm in Groundhog Day.""  How many movies have inspired a new expression in the English language?  Not many.While Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey finds out what life would be like had he never existed, Bill Murray's Phil Connors finds out what it's like to exist without consequences, to live like there's no tomorrow.  I have often seen similarities between Stewart and Murray, and would say they are parallels of two different generations.  Both are actors that are likeable enough to carry any movie.  And Groundhog Day is Murray's best movie (so far).I won't say much more about the movie because it's rich enough with meaning that it could be interpreted in many other ways.

520,thunderrollerss,What if there was no tomorrow... there wasn't today????,10,24 August 2003,This is a movie you will love or hate! Many people love and many more people love it! The basic plot of the movie is like this... There is this news reporter guy that goes to report on the Groundhog's day activities in PA.  He hates his job and pretty much everything about his life and he enjoys being a jerk to anyone and everyone he can. He ends up spending day after day after day in the same exact location. Each morning he wakes up and it is the same day. There have been many papers/ stories written on the idea of immortality and this story is one of the best. It asks the question how should you spend your life here on earth.  It is a very funny movie and it doesn't get too much into ethical issues.

521,mlshoe,A Surprise and a Delight,10,28 December 2003,"Despite having read the reviews, I just wasn't ready for what a delight this film was. I'm normally not a fan of the ""smarmy"" school of humor that's so popular with the original bunch of Saturday Night Live alums: Chase, Belushi, Murray, et al. The ""humor"" in their characters all too often consists of them being ""cooler"" than the rest of the world, and laughing at those less ""cool"". And if you want to be ""cool"", too, you'd better laugh with them. It's humor as high school clique. Of the lot of them, I've always found Bill Murray to be the most tolerable; but even he rode the edge of my tolerance.But in this film, that's the point! Murray starts out as EXACTLY the smarmy character who annoys me so much; and because of who he is, he can't quite get his life to work out right. But through a little bit of Twilight Zone logic, he keeps getting chances to do it right. What seems like a curse at first -- repeating the same day over and over -- turns into an opportunity for him to grow as a character and as a human being.At the end, the smarm is still there; but it's turned inward, and becomes more self deprecating. Murray's character no longer views himself as the cool outsider, laughing at all the rubes. Instead, he joins the rubes -- the human race -- and laughs at life and love and himself. This transformation seems very natural, and makes for an irresistible film.",Groundhog Day

523,david94703,the most thoroughly romantic movie of the baby boom generation,10,25 December 2004,"I think when the history of this era is written, the most interesting entry will be for Bill Murray. On SNL he carved out a sort of Andy Kaufman anti-comedy role, the entertainer with no talent who didn't care if you knew; he'd belt out the songs anyway. Which undoubtedly helped cement the rumor that he was the show's dope dealer doing a cameo.Honing the persona year in and out, in Ground Hog Day he's a charmer with no apparent charm, a nihilist with too much success to notice he's depressed. When he gets the chance to reflect, he finds something he really wants, and discovers he has to develop all of his real qualities, hard as they may be to find, to get it. I gave this movie a ten not for its quality alone, but because I think when we ALL reflect we'll recognize it as the signature film of its time.",Groundhog Day
524,baratheveggie,"Magnum opus of cinema, and life.",10,19 June 2013,"Why is this movie so universal? Why is to so funny and charming, so human and so addictive? I reckon it's because it answers so many important questions that each and every one of us seek answer to fruitlessly every day of our lives. Story is original and funny, a bitter and somewhat misanthropic weatherman comes on business to a small town which he despises from the very bottom of his soul, only to have his life completely flipped around when he starts reliving the same day again, and again, and again... Wrapped up in a cocoon of simple story in a small rural town, Groundhog day turns out to be a self-help vessel carrying to us a reminder of what is really important in life. Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness. Not many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again",Groundhog Day

The characters are rich, and the message is great. Disappointing to find out Rubin, according to Ramis, is Zen Buddhist because it so affirms the values in Christianity. We even used it as a backbone for a bible study in my church's middle school class.How many Christians have felt they were in a twilight zone experience waiting to progress, while having to undergo tests that improve character?

It has Bill Murray in a performance that boasts toward both the devilish and the heartfelt and a safely entertaining amount of jokes and gags. Some of its middle, mainly how the character of Bill Murray deals with his condition, feels somewhat unbeliavable, but the movie quickly finds a way to remind you of the charm it carries.Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray portrait two characters whose development and conclusion allude to the various themes of Groundhog Day and, at the end of the day, are the main ingredient in the sucess of the movie's charm.",Groundhog Day

At first he uses it to only his own advantage, but it becomes quite heartwarming as he starts to help people out, obviously knowing anything bad that was going to happen.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, not only because it was funny, but because it shows even the most heartless people can be kind too.",Groundhog Day

Get out form the bed, go to work, go lunch at some deli, go home at 5¡K Everyday is the same day like yesterday, nothing exciting happens. However, the important thing is how are we going to live today, the one just like every other day? The film used the groundhog festival wisely as a moral.

There's no explanation of how this happened to him (good!!) but its great watching him deal with it.  His main challenge is to make Andi Mcdowell love him and his attempts are wonderfully funny.

After watching this movie again tonight I decided to look up the other credits for the writer.  I was sadly disappointed that there are not any other significant credits.  How is it that someone who created a work of art so clever and sublime, could not be more accomplished in the film industry?Second, It appears that this movie is a litmus test for personalities.

538,tjw-9,Near classic,7,20 December 2003,"Groundhog Day is one of those movies you wish you could remake.  This is not a criticism - it is a complement.  The movie is based on such a powerful thematic idea - that of reliving a day over and over again until you get it right - that it deservers to become the kind of classic story, like A Christmas Carol, that is remade periodically every few years to see what a different cast and director can make of it.For instance, the movie is in the comedy/drama/romance genres, but I felt the comedy should have given way a bit more clearly to drama when the emotional turning point is reached; but the point is that I cared enough about the idea to be interested in thinking about improving its execution. I thought about the movie quite a bit, in fact, and that is exceedingly rare for me.

Gotta love a guy who has some French poetry & some rocky road ready to go... But the plot does provoke some serious reflection - what exactly would you do???

In any case, here goes...I believe that Murray is about as funny as they come, even though in each movie he seems to play the same character with different degrees of attitude.  I still can't seem to get enough.  This movie is classic Murray.The story is also a metaphor for reincarnation, repeating the same day until you somehow get it right.  I won't hold that against the movie.To me, this is comedy at its best.  It has snappy dialogue that never gets boring, interesting and quirky characters, just the right amount of sappiness and emotion, a smart story, and it never gets too raunchy.

It is rare that I watch a movie more than once or twice but I have seen this four or five times and always enjoy it as much as the first time.This I find amazing as the film itself shows the same day over and over, you would have maybe thought the opposite and that you would get bored second time around.Maybe I find it so enjoyable because you put yourself in his shoes and wonder how you would deal with the situation, only to see the film cover every angle until finally the secret is found (though were never quite sure what it is other than 'be good') and the next day dawns Bill Murray is perfect for the role and I don't think it would have worked so well without him.Scores a 9",Groundhog Day

549,stephenclark1,Kierkegaardian Comedy,10,11 March 2007,"Harold Ramis' Groundhog Day (1993) is as a film one would not have anticipated from a man whose previous films included Club Paradise, National Lampoon's Vacation and Caddyshack. These previous films were the broadest of comedies, thinly scripted and redeemed only fitfully by the talents of its stars. While still a comedy, Groundhog Day is a character-based story that, in the end, is a deeply moral film.Bill Murray initially plays to type as Phil Connors, a shallow, egotistical, dead-ended weather man, sent to Punxsutawny, PA to cover the annual Groundhog Day event. It is an empty assignment for an empty man. In response, he is an arrogant prick to his film crew and the locals. Unexpectedly, the crew gets snowed in by a blizzard. Phil tucks in for the night in a B&B, but awakens in the morning to find it is still Groundhog Day. He is repeating the same events as previously, stuck in Punxsutawny, yet only he is aware of this.The film loops through seemingly endless repetitions of the day (at least 33 depicted according to the Wikipedia, but implicitly up to 3600 according to Harold Ramis). At first Phil tries to take advantage of the situation, memorizing all the nuances of the day so he can better manipulate things. The principle target of his plans is Rita, his producer, played by Andie MacDowell. At first they are like oil and water, but as the day repeats he learns her favorite drinks, her dreams and desires. As the repetitions go past, each time he gets a little further in his seduction. At one point, he comes near to the perfect night, but takes one small misstep. From there on, his performance becomes more and more stilted until he realizes he has lost his rhythm and ardor for the pursuit.He sinks into a deepening depression. Drunk and disheveled, he kidnaps the groundhog, Punxsutawny Phil, (no accident their common name, both trapped in a single day) carrying both of them to their deaths in gravel pit. Nevertheless, he awakens in the morning again on Groundhog Day. Multiple attempts at suicide fail similarly. He robs the bank, seduces waitresses, but life seems increasingly empty. Then he encounters a bum who dies in an alley, and he is moved to act. The next time, he takes the old fellow to a diner and fills his stomach, but still he dies. He takes him next to a hospital, but he still dies. Chastened by the finality of death, frustrated, he choses honesty with Rita as they have their morning breakfast. Walking her through his day, she almost believes him and they have a genuine day and evening together, though we he awakes his plight is the same. The film is an enactment of the Kierkegaardian stages of life. Phil starts in the aesthetic stage, interested only in personal enjoyment and the life of the senses. At the start of the movie, he has already reached a dead-end with this approach. He is played out and at sea with himself. Midway through the movie he passes through despair and advances into the ethical stage, becoming aware of the moral implications of action. Despite the fact that his entire life is limited to a single day doomed to endless repetition, he resolves to make a difference. Daily he changes the flat tire of some little old ladies, catches a boy falling from a tree, learns the lives of everyone in town, takes piano lessons, learns ice sculpturing, teaches himself French, and actually becomes a thoughtful and effective weatherman. By the end, he approaches the religious stage, devoting himself selflessly to others. Only then does he realizes an authentic and spontaneous union with Rita. As a result, the next day he awakes with Rita back in real time.The movie is among the most seriously moral films, a lesson in existential philosophy disguised as a Bill Murray comedy. He gives here the first glimpses of the subtlety he would later develop as an actor. The Writer's Guild has ranked the script 27th on a list of the 101 greatest scripts, and the IMDb rates it in the top 250 movies of all time.

Great fun!!!,10,2 March 2006,"I never saw this movie until it had been out on video for a few years, which is a terrible shame - the story is top-notch, the acting is the best you can about find anywhere and it seems almost effortless for the two main characters (Murray & MacDowell).You perhaps have an understanding of the movie, but if not here is the ""Reader's Digest"" version (note that there's not really a plot ""spoiler"", per se, but I'll touch on what goes on later in the movie...if that's an issue to you, perhaps you should forego my review until you've seen the movie).Phil Connors (Murray) is a cranky, self-righteous, spoiled weatherman. He has little use for people in general, yet yearly he has to return to the humble Punxsutawney, PA to showcase whether or not Phil (the groundhog, not Murray) sees his shadow or not. This makes him incredibly miserable, having to deal with and interact with the local rural folks, making him feel as though he's trapped in his own private hell for that day.Well, they get stranded in the wonderful, bustling mecca that is Punxsutawney (are you getting my sarcasm? (I can say that 'cuz I'm originally from Johnstown, PA)) and to make matters worse, someone is seeing to it that Phil is forced to repeat this day, with memories and awareness intact no less, ad nauseum, all the while perfecting himself in the process.A terrific feel-good movie that has a great replay value.

561,lostonu,"Practice Makes Perfect, Or Keep At It Until You Get It Right",10,2 February 2013,"I have about twenty, or so, films included in my Top 5 Movies of All-Time. I would not be surprised if some others have that same dilemma. Somewhere in that top five is the movie Groundhog Day (1993). After much consideration, I have come to the conclusion that Groundhog Day is a perfect movie. Also, I have to acknowledge that statement's clear contradiction that while Groundhog Day is a perfect movie, it does not necessarily mean that it is the greatest movie of all-time. You see, a film can be perfect by soundly succeeding in delivering its message, or by finding its mark in what it is trying to convey/accomplish. Other films I believe to be perfect are: The Natural (1984), It's A Wonderful Life (1946), High Noon (1952), and D.O.A. (1950). Those films may not be the best movies of all-time, but they are perfect cinematic works. Groundhog Day is perfect because it deals with a concept that has endless possibilities. This is a film that easily could have a running time of 3 1/2 to 4 hours without diminishing its quality and enjoyment. Groundhog Day delves into a seemingly Omnipotent universe of whacked out metaphysics and Twilight Zone type possibilities, and that abstractness creates an infinite number of mind-bending/logic defying feats that Phil finds himself able to perform to the amazement of all those who stand to witness. In essence, the powers that be allow time to stand still for Phil as he goes through a long and arduous period of adjustment, and he is given, basically, an eternity to ""suddenly"" transform right before Rita's eyes.If you really pay attention, Groundhog Day tells you what you need to know about Harold Ramis when he is at his best as a writer (and director). Ramis is able to smoothly and seamlessly tie together the main and sub-plots of a story in such a way that the viewer is treated to a believable sequence of events, no matter how fantastic the circumstances may appear. Bill Murray is his usually excellent self, and Andie MacDowell, as Rita, is the most beautiful woman in the world. The rest of the cast is beyond outstanding.",Groundhog Day
562,jokomine,It's an okay movie.,8,22 July 2020,I didn't laugh or something. But it was a nice movie to watch because it has a nice concept. I think what made the film special it's the performances which I've found very successful. Music is great too. I will give it 8 because I've seen better films but it should be up there because I watched terrible movies with higher score.,Groundhog Day
563,petabit,This movie gets better every time I see it,10,2 February 2005,"I just read somewhere that the Internet is full of philosophers and religions that have adopted this movie as their favorite parable. I'm not surprised, but that's not the reason I love it.This movie starts with a premise that could be light, silly, trite, or promising but disappointing. Through deft writing and Murray's amazing comic timing, it manages to be none of those. The movie just keeps getting better the longer you watch it, and every silliness comes with a bit of serious thinking behind it.Take home from this movie: A visceral awareness of what really matters in life, and how your own attitude in it is really everything there is. Not just mostly... entirely everything.This movie threatens at first to go on forever, but after a while I wished it would. It compresses the lesson of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" into its first act, and then improves continually from there. I honestly can't think of how this movie could be improved.To see how bad this movie *could* have been, watch ""Multiplicity"" with Michael Keaton. Then watch ""Groundhog Day"" again and enjoy. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen it.",Groundhog Day

Its funny from start to end.  A great story where he discovers who he really is, but has a great time discovering it. Imagine what fun you would have living the same day over and over and over and nothing you did, even killing yourself could stop it.

567,vassl1,A cinematic comedy of gargantuan proportions,10,14 January 2003,"It is no sooner than the credits of this holy film have gone from the screen that the viewer realizes that he was witnessed the birth of a new Method. Not that of Brando and De Niro, but the aural force emitted from the acting of this spiritual leader, Bill Murray. A majestic performance of astounding subtlety that brings to mind Orson Welles.As Murray cries: ""You're hypocrites! All o'ya!"", his demented lament - one of a soul trapped in parallel universes of existence -  leaves us to ponder on the meaning of life itself and what we make of it. Harold Ramis' direction is a true tour de force, ripping forward to the uncertain (if any) future of the hero. And when Murray jumps of a chapel (campanario/champagnerie), those of us who have not yet suffered a stroke from intensive spasms of laughter, enter a state of shock, a catharsis both on and off the screen.
Arguably one of the greatest comedies of all time, this Kafkaesque interpretation of one man and his weather demands repetitive viewing, until the onset of coma. View and be blessed...",Groundhog Day

This is a movie I would show to people I love, hoping to share all I feel about it with them. Bill Murray is a genius...as is Harold Ramis. How could this great movie be so underappreciated?

And he is glad when he is on his way home at the end of this day, but when they are on the highway, they have to go back because there will be a storm. Phil (Bill Murray) goes back to his bed and breakfast, and the wakes up the next morning with the same song in the radio as the day before. First he thinks it's deja vu, but after waking up again, on Groundhog day, he knows that there is something very very very wrong. He's having his worst day over, and over, and over again. And all the other people don't know, they just living the day. And Phil falls in love with Rita (Andie MacDowell), and he has to win her love everyday over and over again.

573,hannahwheatley-74891,No Consequences,7,19 March 2018,"This was my first time seeing this movie and I enjoyed it just as much as I imagine most people did. It was an idea that has been done many times. This movie is one of the original movies with this idea and I think it was executed as well as it could have been. I liked seeing how his outlook on life changed every time he had to repeat the same day over and over again. It was obvious the first couple of days were going to be him trying to figure out what was happening. my favorite parts in this movie were when he had finally realized he could do anything he wanted with no consequences. He punched an annoying friend in the face, he said anything he wanted and he even killed himself....many times. Even though he didn't know exactly why this was happening he used it to his advantage. he used it to pick up girls and every time he would mess up on a date he could easily start the whole date over again because he knew the day would start completely over and nothing he did stuck. He would learn new information about people to impress them and pretend he was someone he was not. He was definitely smart but he did these things because he was bored and wanted to see how much he could get away with. I also enjoyed how relatable it was. I imagine ay person would go through the exact process that Bill Murray went through in this movie. The end was obvious but I still enjoyed watching him grow as a person. He began to do good deeds which he never would have done in the beginning of the movie. He becomes a genuinely good person and that is how he gets out of repeating the exact same day over and over again. Groundhog Day was funny when it wanted to be but serious when it needed to be. It was overall a very well thought out movie and I enjoyed it very much.",Groundhog Day
574,kobisims,Bill Murray,9,19 March 2018,This movie was really good in my opinion. Its hard to make a movie that repeats the same day funny and Bill Murray made it funny his performance was very good. My favorite part is the beginning when he realizes that he is repeating the days he does everything that people would think of doing such as getting chased by the cops or robbing a bank. Also in the movie you see Murray's attitude change as he relives the days and he starts to feel sympathy for himself and others. It also made like the movie a little more and I would watch this movie again.,Groundhog Day

But the actual presentation of it couldn't possibly be done better. And with that it is a fact that any other movies trying to work out this theme are bound to fail hopelessly, as all the genuinely funny stuff about it already has been done in this one. If you've seen Clean Slate with Dana Carvey, you know what I'm talking about.Bill Murray is hysterical, and it is too bad that he rarely appears in a bullseye hit like this one.

580,jeffnc,Unusual that I enjoyed a film involving the supernatural so much,8,9 March 2000,"It's not common that a film involving the surreal or supernatural - especially time travel - is so successful.  I think the reason for this is that once you enter that realm, literally anything goes.  That concept may seem exciting at first, but in practice it can become so illogical and have so little basis in reality that ultimately we can't relate to it.  Consider how silly time travel can become.  For example, in ""Back to the Future"", looking at a photograph and seeing the people in it start to fade?? C'mon. Or dealing with ""paradoxes"" such as going back in time and killing your grandfather.  What now?Not trying to explain how time travel occurs, this movie skirts those issues by simply backing up and reliving a day (there is no chance to ""travel back to the future"" - you must ""live through it"".)  One of the reasons it is so successful is that while ultimately a happy movie, the truly horrible feelings that would inevitably arise in this situation are also explored. Finally living through his day to the next day is a metaphor in this case for the maturing of the main character.  He does not know what is happening to him, but in the end he has been allowed a period of experimentation and growth.  Haven't we all fantasised about that?  For example, having 10 fresh chances to approach a person of the opposite sex we want to meet and seeing which works best?  In the meantime the film explores this journey with both humour and sorrow.  Having 10 fresh chances to try something sounds great if it's your *choice* - but not so great if you never get to stop the carousel and say ""That's a keeper - let's get on with my life now!""  Few actors other than Murray could play this role so well - he seems perfectly cast. Enjoy!",Groundhog Day

I have watched it 100% straight and 100% stoned on very good weed, my preference is to watch it quite stoned on primo bud. I have finally watched it so much that now I'm looking for real scientific miscalculations and the best that I can ascertain
is that there is one major inconsistency that just never gets thought about. Here it is: Phil is 100% aware that he is caught in a time-warp, reliving the same day continuously day after day. The inconsistency is that so does the rest of the town, except they are totally unaware that they too are living the same day over and over. Only Phil is aware that he has an ability to constantly change and improve. Everyone else experiences change,
but they are blissfully unaware that they too are reliving ""Groundhog Day"" over and over as well.Plus, there is the inconsistency of Phil predicting events that stay the same day after day, yet other events change day after day. I've always watched this without questioning that genuine scientific impossibility, even though I very much believe in the possibility that someday mankind might discover a secret wormhole that allows for time travel and existence in two places at the same time. The fact that astrophysics is coming around to believing the universe actually folds in upon itself, thus paving the way for wormholes to actually exist gives me far more comfort than believing in the concept of ""God's"" existence.",Groundhog Day

A 'perfect film' being not necessarily the most profound or greatest film, but one with no discernible flaws. Everything works, the writing, acting, how scenes are put together. Princess Bride is another example of a perfect movie.The plot makes this such an ""odd"" movie. It is its own category, its own genre. I go back to look at individual scenes for themselves. They are varied and wonderful. The absolute best of Bill Murray, and that is saying something. Andie MacDowell at her best too. But the more I see the work of Harold Ramis the more I admire it.

I can't think of any other actor who could have done the role justice. Murray captures not only the humor, but also lets his character grow and become much more sympathetic as the film progresses.Harold Ramis, the director, also has to take great credit for this, as his pacing for the whole film is absolutely flawless. It's disappointing that Ramis has never come close to making this quality of film again...Also, Andie McDowell gives by far and away her best ever performance in this movie. Her and Murray have great chemistry and she is the perfect foil for him right throughout the film.This is truly and wonderful and uplifting film which everyone should see, and more than once!",Groundhog Day
589,rafaelq3,A film that can change the way you see the life,10,29 July 2007,"A minor thing for me is that the film is refinedly funny and that it develops at a continuous speed that you cannot be boring at any moment. An exception of that may be the first ten minutes, because the main character, Phil Connors, achieves to transmit his personal view of life, as a bitter routine. We, as he himself, don't have the minimum interest in the Groundhog day (sorry for those that love groundhogs). Since the moment that Phil Connors is trapped in time, the film is no more senseless. The thing that makes this film so valuable, and not recognized enough, is that it reflects our own lives. The first time that Phil re-lives the Groundhog day, one can think ¿what's happened? ¿which extrasensorial power has made him to be trapped in that date? Oh, well, it's just fantasy. But when you contemplate all the story, you realize that the reason is in Phil himself, the same as the reason why we live our lives as a boring routine is in ourselves. The first things that Phil Connors makes when he realizes that he cannot scape from that endless repetition, are funny, but nonsense. The happiness that we find in those things that we make to break the routine of our lives are funny too for a short time, but the entertainment ends very quickly, because our lives have no sense. The character of Phil Connors searches different ways of finding how to fill his eternal life, but the only one thing that can give sense to his life is LOVE. Not just the relation with that wonderful (until that moment undiscovered) woman, who is working with him, but love to mankind, to any person that needs us. Love means interest in their lives, in their worries. The way he finally breaks the spell can only be understood by those who have penetrate in the meaning of the film.",Groundhog Day

When I showed this movie to my then 10 year old daughter, Jessica, she was horrified by it for many years; she didn't see the comedy, she saw the hell of someone who has, as Sartre's play is named in English, ""No Exit."" Murray's character's inability to accept that he can not keep the old man alive when it's the old man's day to die is a movie moment that always brings tears to my eyes.This movie is one of my 50 favorites, and it's a hard list to make.",Groundhog Day

Instead of ghosts showing him the errors of his ways and warning of the consequences, it is that he must live his in an unchanging way until it dawns on him that life is not what he made of it but what he should make of it. The most poignant part of the film is where he tries to save the life of the old man and realizes that there are things in life which are already determined and are immutable, but most of life is changeable.

A movie that, quite simply, makes you feel good. In that, feel ONLY good. Not a single bad moment. That's a high peak to ascend. 'It's A Wonderful Life' ascends it. As does 'Groundhog Day'. Or at least it comes tantalizingly close.Like 'It's A Wonderful Life', this, too, is a fantasy film. And like 'It's A Wonderful Life', this film, too, is about goodness. Only, Jimmy Stewart, every so subtly playing George Bailey in the former, had to be SHOWN how good he WAS. Whereas Bill Murray, with a matchingly evocative depiction of Phil Connors in this, learns how good he can BECOME. 'Groundhog Day' is a purely, unabashedly spiritual film. Its premise is one that could easily have fallen flat, or become a basis for pulp kiddie fantasy fare - of an ordinary man getting stuck in a time loop where he wakes up, each day, to find it's the 2nd of February, all over again. Don't be fooled however ... that is merely the backdrop for an intensely, almost Biblically spiritual tale, of a man's transcendence - ""transformation"" would be too weak a word - from an intensely self-centred, unlikeable ""jerk"" (as he calls himself at one point), to a being of pure beauty, and goodness unalloyed. It displays how, placed in such an unenviable position, Phil traverses a gamut of emotions - from initial shock and fear, to the purely selfish realization that he can do whatever he wants without caring for the consequences, to ... well, I don't want to reveal too much - let's just say that, at first, he plays the day, and, later, the day plays him.It's a spectacular, and fittingly understated, performance by Bill. It has often been opined that no other actor could have done the role, and, watching Bill, one does feel so. Andie Macdowell is, however, equally luminous, and provides the halo to Phil's God (as he, again at one point, calls himself). They complement each other perfectly, and, together, tell us a tale which can never be forgotten.'Groundhog Day' is a cleansing, purifying experience. To call it a fantasy film - as Wikipedia does - is unfair, for it is SOOO much more. Why I am giving it 9, instead of 10, out of 10. I don't know. But I am. Let's leave it at that.",Groundhog Day

601,IMDbean,groundhog day,8,19 March 2018,"Groundhog Day stars many great actors, the most notable of them being Bill Murray. Playing Phil, a sarcastic and selfish weatherman, Murray brings multiple elements of humor to the movie. Phil finds himself stuck in the same day, Groundhog Day, and he has to relive it until he 'gets it right'. The setting is in Punxsutawney, a small town in Pennsylvania. The movie itself is a clever rom-com with a moral, and I applaud Harold Ramis along with the writers. The dialogue was hilarious, and the story was able to keep its more meaningful elements while still being funny. I'd love to watch it again, and I think it's better then most modern romantic comedies. 8/10",Groundhog Day
602,beautyjudge,Top 10 Of All-Time,10,14 February 2007,"Groundhog Day is one of the most cleverly written/directed/acted movies ever produced. If you've never seen it, watch it without distraction. Undoubtedly, you will then be able to grasp the beauty that lies within (after repeated viewings, of course-not because they are required, but because you will want to). This movie is so well-made on many levels. If you're feeling down, this movie will cheer you up and probably change your outlook on life. I have seen this movie many times and I know it will be seen many more. It is that special. I am obsessed, as I'm sure there are many more that feel the way I do. Maybe you will be to. I tell everybody I know about this movie, and every one of them praised me for it. I've read all the reviews, plus I frequently read the IMDb message board for this movie. It kind of reassures me, I'm not the only one who ""gets"" it. Pass it along! Plus, this is definitely worth mentioning-if they were ever allowed to give retro Academy Awards, Bill Murray, as well as the movie itself, would easily walk away with the honor. The Academy people didn't really ""get it"" back then.",Groundhog Day

605,grover-9,An incredibly undervalued film,10,21 January 1999,"Beneath the light and generally upbeat tone of this film lies one interpretation of ""the meaning of life."" Whether you espouse reincarnation or not, the idea of ""doing it over until you do it right"" is something one learns as one ages.Why is it some experiences happen once and others seem to recur in an unending pattern? No matter how hard you try, you find yourself faced with the same dilemma - in spite of a change of location, employment, even significant other.Groundhog Day offers an answer in an easy-to-swallow form. Take it on the level you choose, but if you plumb the depths on this one, you will find it very worthwhile.My hat is particularly off to Bill Murray, who appears aware of the complex task before him, and to the primary writer of the screenplay, who I assume is Danny Rubin. Unfortunately, Rubin  seems not to have followed up this effort with anything of comparable significance - yet.",Groundhog Day

610,asagainmyself,An inspirational and witty comic fantasy,10,18 March 2001,"This film is amazing.  Not only has Harold Ramis used wit and intelligence in a hilarious comedy as he did in Ghostbusters, but he has delivered a feel-good masterpiece that makes one think twice about the direction of their lives.  This film had much more than a story to tell, (although it's appearance of The Twilight Zone gone comedy is breathtaking) but it actually enlightens the audience to a whole new world of possibilities within their lives. Bill Murray is at his best as a cruel and cynnical but witty Pittsburg weatherman named Phil Connors.  After going to the small but lively town of Punxatawney to report the groundhog festival, he learns that he is doomed to repeat the same day over and over again.... until he gets it right. The antics Phil goes about are wonderfully imaginative, sparking the question in everyone's mind: What would you do if there were no tomorrow? When the film gets a bit more serious, Phil decides to impress the woman he secretly loves (Andie McDowell).  Unfortunately, every day she wakes up without any memory of yesterday.  Phil is the only one who this happens to.The interesting aspect of this film, as stated in a prior review, is the unmentioned amount of days Phil repeats.  After close analysis I found it to be about twenty years.  His learning different talents, such as piano and multiple languages, implies a span of many years.  Not to mention that a simple game he learned, throwing cards in a hat, took him months to learn. Imagine all the games he learned besides that.  ""Is this what you do with eternity?"" McDowell asks.",Groundhog Day

You can watch this film many times before it is the case that you don't pick up on some new nuance of gesture from Murray or some other subtle perfection. One of my favourite lines: ""You wanna know about the weather? You're asking the wrong Phil. I'll tell you about the weather. It's cold and it's grey and it's gonna last the rest of your life."" His descent into despair allows for some of the best comedy of the film...Nowhere can a great comedian shine better than as a character who has hit rock bottom and has nothing left to lose",Groundhog Day
613,charlesquinn_1999,A Bill Murray Classic,9,19 January 2002,"Hilarious!  A classic for the Bill Murray fan.  Andie MacDowell is subtly sexy as always.  What I appreciate most about this unique film is that it realistically addresses a question all of us have asked ourselves before...""What would I have done differently if I could do it again?""  (I wouldn't have raised my voice at my senior prom date--a stunningly attractive girl--because she didn't wait until I opened the car door for her.  We didn't know each other well to begin with and it ruined the evening.) We see through Murray the transformation of a man from self-centered to sharing, cold-hearted to caring, as he re-lives the same day over and over and over again.  My favorite scene involved a dinner date with Murray's film love interest, Andie MacDowell.  As they dine across from one another, discussing their interests, hopes and dreams, Andie highlights her love for European classics (or something similarly mundane).  Murray's character, in classic alpha-male form, bursts out laughing like ""that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.""  Andie is visibly hurt.  Cut to the next scene--same dinner, same conversation.  Andie--""I love European classics.""  Murray - meditating on the profundity of Andie's statement, quotes a poem from that period...in French!  Andie--""I didn't know you had such an appreciation for those works.""  Murray--""Oui""  (French for yes) Score 10 pts. for Murray in Andie's book.  For one day, we get to see someone live a regret-free, no holds barred, do want you want to, anything goes day.  Yesterday's mistake becomes today's victory!  I (obviously) haven't seen the film in awhile, but I recall little profanity and no nudity or violence, making it (somewhat) kid appropriate.  One of my favorite comedies of all time.",Groundhog Day
614,dr_fava_beans,Frank Capra would have been....,8,21 May 2006,"... very pleased! Everybody knows the premise. An egoistic, selfish and not quite likable weather man who has been covering the ""GroundHog Day"" celebration in a small town for the last 4 years, makes his views very clear on what he thinks to be stupid waste of time. He does not spend time with his crew members and after grumbling for some more hours goes to sleep. Next day, Mr. Fantasy kicks in his life, as he finds himself once again reliving ""GroungHog Day""... And again... and again...Redundant to say, that in his ordeal of re-living the same day over and over again, he realizes his flaws and becomes a better person in the end... The storyline will have people screaming Frank Capra and Cary Grant(not James Stewart, he would be too ""nice"" for the main character). However, we get Harold Ramis and Bill Murray instead. And guess what? They make it a gem! Of course, major credit also goes to the script and editing department, which are razor sharp. And one can only visualize(if someone has not already seen the movie, and is a Bill Murray fan) as to what Bill Murray can do with an opportunity like this! The result is a hilarious comedy, along with it's touchy moments(not overdone, though there were plenty of opportunity for those) and the ultimate ""redemption"". The overall feeling - have to watch it again... and again... and again...",Groundhog Day

624,gazoot,A deep and beautiful message in a funny and always appropriate movie.,10,12 February 2002,"I would like to express myself on one of the greatest and maybe most underrated movies ever made. Contained within is a deep and beautiful message that everyone should take example from.Starting out as a sarcastic comedy, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, a self-absored and cynical weatherman. He's trying to climb the television network ladder, and though he might be on his way up, he still got a task to do that he hates above everything else. Every year, the famous Groundhog day in Punxsutawney takes place, and Phil has to make a cute report about this event. Of course, in Phils vocabulary ""cute"" is a synonym for ""pathetic"".He travels there with a news team, the cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and Rita (Andie Macdowell), the total opposite of Phil. She is a kind, warm and gentle person. Naturally, there is a big clash between Phil and her.They arrive at Punxsutawney, and Phil does a short and arrogant report and leaves shortly thereafter, to Ritas big annoyance. However, a snow storm forces Phil to stay one more night in his ""favourite"" town.Next morning he wakes up early, eager to leave this extremely cute and happy place. He looks out the window, and sees a very familiar sight. It's Groundhog Day! Out on the street, he becomes perplexed and yet convinced that this is the exactly same day as yesterday. Same things happen in same order. He manages to keep sane however, and falls asleep in the evening. Next day he wakes up to exactly the same song on the radio... Rise and shine, it's Groundhog day!I'm amazed how much truth and wisdom story writer Danny Rubin has put into this movie. First, Phil realize that he can do anything and no one can stop him. He tries out virtually every capital sin, only to realize that this is not it. After a while, he comes to the conclusion that the big change must happen within himself.It's this conclusion I feel is the most important, as it reflects the civilization and humanity every day. We can go cursing the situation around us, but that only ends up in torturing ourselves. We have to realize that one of the few things we really have control over is, that's right, ourself. And as shown in Phil's change after this realization, everything is within us. It's only a question of letting it out and stop the feelings that makes us feel bad.I'm not saying this is easy, it could be a lifelong process (or LOTS of Groundhog days), where you slowly have to realize that ""this place might help me do something about myself"". So was the story about Phil, anyway. Does he ever get out of his ""personal hell""? Well, go rent the movie and find out!",Groundhog Day

The basic genre of the movie is the ""romantic comedy"" genre, which is flooded by enjoyable but very average movies that makes time fly by without leaving any major impressions. I believe the genre also is the curse of Groundhog Day, people are supposed to leave their brains shut of when watching these kind of movies and no one is supposed to love romantic comedies, you are meant to like them. In my view Groundhog Day is the most underestimated work of art in the movie history....(or it might be that people simply have different tastes and just don't love the movie as I do, but when it comes to Groundhog Day I don't like that kind of thoughts ;) )The movie is about the art of enjoying your everyday life.... ....or it is a philosophical what-if-movie, about the eventuality of someone having to relive the same day over and over again, reflecting on the moral and psychological consequences... ...or it is a beautiful romantic film where someone manages to change into a better person in order to charm the woman of his dreams... ...or a hilarious comedy that makes you breathless while trying to stop laughing.If you don't like some of the different aspects of the film simply ignore them, you will still enjoy the movie.Groundhog Day is in my view the most obvious 10/10 movie.

629,ehlanor,The nature of time,10,21 November 2011,"Time is nothing more than that: one day after one day after another. The only thing that tells us we are not living the >same< day once and again is the fact that we preserve our memories. To make use of time passing is one great advantage the human race has. This movie helps to understand this concept and the nature of time itself.A man who lives the same day, time and again, who has no consequences of his actions, who is trapped in time with no way out. He wishes he would be trapped in a different day, a day he would love to repeat once and again, but no, he is trapped in a common day, surrounded of people he barely cares about. He tries everything, even suicide. He also tries robbery, without fearing any consequences of his acts. He becomes extremely bored.He feels totally unhappy... until he accepts the situation and decides to try something different. He starts doing things he's not used to, he suddenly wants to learn to play the piano, avoid other people's accidents, gain the heart of a woman he first didn't care about at all, but whom he got to know until he finally fell in love with.It is this transformation and this love what pull him through time.The same day repeats over and over, until he lives a perfect day. And even though it is only a few hours he has until the end of the day, he actually got everybody to love him, the woman he loves gives him all her admiration and respect, he makes lots of friends and he uses the time in such a productive way that it is almost impossible to believe one person can achieve so much in ""just one day""... He has become one superior man, he has transcended time.Only then he breaks the spell of time and time passes. He is no longer trapped in time, but he has learned to live now, from being an asshole he is now a great human being.But is this not the actual nature of time as we know it? Is it not actually the same thing as in the movie?

It is somehow like the movie ""Edge of Tomorrow "" that the leading character experience the same day again and again. But the differences between these two fantasy movies is that in Groundhog Day, the only way to get out of the infinite cycle is to change person's attitude towards life, which makes this movie not a simple comedy, but a terrific movie with full philosophy on life.Often we hear the adage, ""It is just a film"". Well, but what if we truly face the similar predicament?Assuming that we all have to suffer the same day like Phil and whatever we did today would leave no impact on others tomorrow and what makes you awake everyday is a song saying I got you Babe , maybe most of us would react to this crazy predicament passively and madly like what Phil did at first, giving everything up as despair. But when we reflect the situation more calmly,we might live a totally different lives. Just as the Phil did in the movie,he took up piano, began reading, learned to ice-sculpt.Everything seems better than beforeThere are many truth conveyed in this movie, and I do appreciate such a ingenious movie.

The planet is spinning on its axis, revolving around the sun – its motion terrifying in its ceaseless consistency.Bill Murray's work in the movie Groundhog Day is underrated: he walks a razor line between comedy and horror, waking up to the exact same day each and every day. Strangely, the premise of this film – that a man must re-live the same day again and again for eternity isn't a story about immortality. Ultimately, it's a parable about aging – a ""cautionary tale"" urging the viewer not to let his life fall into a numbing sameness of days. Instead, change things up. Take risks. Have fun. Do the thing you're afraid you might not be able to do. Even if you fail at it, you'll be able to say you gave it a shot. At least you'll have done battle with the sameness of your days.

Bill Murray is perfectly cast as the grumpy weatherman whose egotistical character would rather be in the studio than out on location. Andie MacDowell is equally great as the kind and caring 'environmentally friendly' love interest that contrasts diligently with Murrays bullish persona. The concept is something that almost every person has toyed with at one point or another - what would happen if tomorrow I woke up and re-lived today. With this in mind Groundhog Day manages to investigate this notion with humour, wit and a sense of class that makes it stand out as a great movie that will, I'm sure, endure the very thing it explores - time.",Groundhog Day

651,philenor,this 'what-if' comedy surpasses all expectations,10,12 February 1999,"This surpasses all the expectations one would have for the kind of movie that it appears to be: a whimsical comedy based on a 'what if?' premise, in which some fundamental assumption about the universe around us is altered, to amusing effect.  Films in this particular sub-genre (does it have a name? I think of these as 'Twilight Zone' comedies) have a certain appeal for me, but most supply a few laughs, not much more.  I usually come away from them with a sense of an opportunity missed, due to sloppy execution or lack of imagination.  The screenplay of ""Groundhog Day"" is outstanding, in that its creators evidently gave much thought to answering the question: if a person found himself inescapably, eternally repeating the same day in his life, just what _would_ he do?  The execution of this 'thought experiment' is so thorough that it passes beyond hilarity, beyond cleverness -- though the film has both qualities in abundance -- to reach a level of psychological, even spiritual profundity that puts Groundhog Day in league with the very best examples of its type, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Carol"". All this from a Bill Murray comedy -- who would have thought! (""Scrooged"", Bill's own version of the ""Christmas Carol"" story, wilts in comparison.) Anyone who liked ""The Truman Show"" ought to love this.  It crackles, it surprises, and it even moves, with Murray's dry wit steering us clear of sentimentality.  Watch and enjoy it again and again.",Groundhog Day

You can watch this movie as a good-humoured comedy turning around the crazy idea of the same day repeating over and over and have all the fun you can ask for. The cast is great, with Bill Murray going through all the highs and lows coming with his situation, Andie McDowell at her loveliest and Chris Elliott delivering great one-liners. When you start thinking it over, it occurs to you that the script touches on the last questions of human existence. It's not easy to postpone the question about life's sense, when there is no more tomorrow to postpone it until. Watching the flick, you might not immediately notice the plot's depth, just as it takes Bill Murray's character some time to realize the time-loop he's caught in.

It's amazing to me to see his complete personality change and turnaround, even after the 10th time.The supporting characters also do a nice job holding the plot up and adding to the humour.

In the beginning the story seems to be strange, but then you recognize more and more that this movie is pure philosophy, pure wisdom. The director must be an Illuminated or something like this. If you have a bad day, all you have to do, is to think on this movie and things will change. The actors, Bill Murray and Andie Mac Dowell, are absolutely marvelous. The scene, where Bill as Phil tells Andie as Rita how wonderful she is, is indescribable, although I know it only with german synchronsation. Well, you MUST see this movie, there is no way.

I never dreamed that I would actually fall into the similar loop - viewing it repeatedly for 3 months! This was all happened 5 years ago but I still viewed it once 3 or 4 months.Its attraction is not only that it displayed in full the 'second chance' spirit of the Twilight Zone series, but more importantthat the second chance is worth pursuing.

658,bluehippie,Accidental Buddhism lesson?,10,27 March 2006,"I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but the movie seems to follow the Buddhist path to enlightenment almost exactly. For anyone who doesn't know, the path is similar to the steps that people go through when dealing with failure or death. First there is confusion, then denial, then anger, then reasoning, and then acceptance. In Buddhism, one has to first realize that there is suffering. Phil does not realize what is happening at first; it's a shock that the day is repeating. He goes to sleep the first few times, hoping the day will change. When it doesn't, he gets angry and begins to kill himself in numerous ways. In Buddhism, this would be akin to living life frivolously. Once Phil realizes this will not end the day, he begins to do good things. This is the bargaining stage. However, this is not true altruism in that he is only doing good in order to escape the day. It is not until he accepts his fate that he begins to do good simply for the sake of doing good, and not for selfish reasons. This is the first real step in attaining enlightenment: accepting that life is suffering, and choosing to ease the suffering of others. Through this idea, Phil is finally able to escape the day, which would be akin to escaping the cycle of reincarnation and attaining nirvana. Essentially, Phil is going through this cycle on a microscopic basis, one day at a time instead of one life at a time. Sorry for the long explanation, I just thought it was fascinating that such a funny and entertaining movie could have such a deep undercurrent, whether the producers meant it or not.",Groundhog Day

Bill Murray changes his personality for 100%, from ""I don't give a damn f*ck"", to ""Caring about everything surrounding him"" by facing him with his own activities from the day before, over and over again. The problem for Bill is, that all these days are one the same day, from beginning til endJust imagine: how would you react if you'd wake up tomorrow morning realizing it is the same day as the day before, and you can expect the same things to happen, once again!!

It has been a wish for centuries. You have heard people say "" I wish I could go back in time and know what I know now"" and to me this is what this movie represents.

Not suicide, not cleverness, but ""forgetting yourself"" and spending your life in beauty in order to help other people. There are limits to this, as the ""poor old man"" shows.The moment he accepts his faith and starts to help other people he is on his way out. There is a smile on his face.

671,mcolussy,Want the scoop? I've got you babe!,10,1 July 2020,"I watch Groundhog Day on February 2nd every year and it never gets old. This movie is my FAVORITE movie of ALL time. You may wonder, how can Groundhog Day be my favorite movie of all time? Well lead actor has to play a role, right? Bill Murray is a comedic genius. He so perfectly blends seriousness with being funny. I don't know that anyone else could have done that role any better than Bill. Bill had perfect chemistry with co-lead Andie MacDowell, and to the point where it was believable. Sometimes you see couples in movies and you wonder how they would ever mesh...well these two make it work perfectly.However, the acting itself isn't what makes a movie great, it has to be the script, right? Well the writing is great too. However, the sign of a true story is if transcends momentary enjoyment to more of an everlasting philosophical and/or spiritual benefit. I always ask people when they are about to watch the movie that if you had eternity, what would you do with it? Seriously, ponder on this a bit. What would you do? Essentially, this movie attempts to dabble in the philosophical and spiritual. The scene with the guys at the bar summarizes what comes next. Phil, played by Bill, looks hopeless in his scenario after he realizes he is trapped not only in Punxsutawney, but in Groundhog Day itself. Phil is talking to his bar mate, Gus, when Phil is asked posed with determining what kind of a guy he is while peering into his beer mug. You see, some guys would look at that glass and thing it was half full, but Phil looks at it and sees it as half empty.At this point, Phil had to consider what to do with himself going forward so he isn't wasting his opportunity. This then sets off the tone for the rest of the act: Phil does what I think most of us would do at first if we were posed with no consequences: indulge. He goes after food, sex, and money. He then sets his sights on Rita, played by Andie, to realize that time after time, Phil as his shallow self-reveals itself every time, does not have what it takes to get Rita to fall in love with him. He then becomes clinically depressed and tries to kill himself in every way he can imagine to no long-lasting avail. Phil just won't die.Eureka! Then comes the pivot. Phil seeks Rita's help for real by taking her to breakfast and saying ""I'm a god"" and then ""I'm an immortal"" and then ""I know everything"". Phil tries to prove his false assumption by telling all the fellow people in the diner's bios. Andie says that this is not possible and asks what he knows about her. Phil then tells a lot of romantic and intimate things about her that proves that he really can change and truly does love Rita. I feel that the next scene where he is sitting in bed with Rita during her objective witness of Phil's unnatural knowledge tells the story of how long Phil wrestled with his imprisonment in the day and town he hates. When tossing cards and hitting every time while Rita misses every time, Rita says it'd take a year to get good at it. Phil says ""six months, four-five hours a day."" Rita asks ""Is this what you do with eternity?Pause! Is this what you'd do with eternity? I doubt it. Surely you could do good stuff with your time, right? I believe it is at this moment that Phil sets off to change his fate. The very next day he starts doing good things: feeding the homeless, rescuing kids falling out of trees, fixing flat tires, stop someone from choking, etc. It wasn't until Phil changed that he could change his fate, while scoring Rita's love along the way. Rita never could love a shellfish person, she was too good of a person. Phil fundamentally changed what motivated him, and thus became a good person. That is what Rita really wanted all along, and not someone who could pretend to care about her. What a romantic story! What a funny way to show it! What a philosophical and spiritual story! This movie has it all where it counts! Watch it with me on the next Groundhog Day, won't you? And don't forget to consider that even though you and I aren't trapped in Groundhog Day like Phil, we are certainly ""trapped"" in our own lives, and it us up to us to make the most good out of it.",Groundhog Day

673,areid-75085,Twilight-Zone movie,10,20 November 2020,"Groundhog Day is the other feature-length film of the Twilight Zone and like the Twilight Zone, it's neither good nor bad it just is. Like the Twilight Zone, the time loop is never explained on why it started, why the main heroine falling in love genuinely was important or him falling in love with the town as well. It's like a slow burn where Phil loses his mind. We start off by getting to know him and understanding his personality. He's arrogant and narcissistic, pretty much an unlikeable guy that hates the setting of the movie. Then we get to the loop of the film when Phil realizes that he is constantly repeating the day and feels hopeless. Then he has this epiphany that he can do whatever he wants. He is later seen taking advantage of the time loop and using it to satisfy his desires. He binge eats, smokes, steals money, and sleeps around (Groundhog Day, 34:00-40:00). He's living a carefree life and doing as he pleases. This scene is where the Twilight Zone episode starts. As we watch him do all of the things that frankly anyone one would do if given the opportunity we start to see that doing whatever he wants is getting boring and really wants to get out. Then as the movie progresses we start to see not only personality-wise but physically how this is taking a toll on him. When he starts helping people out there is this scary wisdom behind his eyes. The man literally remembers killing himself with a groundhog he saw his own death. Yeah, he gives the homeless man money, gets coffee to his coworkers, learns how to play the piano, and ice sculpts. He even dedicates his time to save the old homeless man. He then spends the next loop saving and helping everyone. Then he is thanked by everyone at the party (Groundhog Day, 1:10:25- 1:29:00). Through this montage of him helping people and him growing as a person, we should also remember that he was basically broken down mentally to get to this place of kindness and wisdom by this supernatural force that has no origin. With all of that being said I love this movie. It's promoted as being a Romantic Comedy but when looking at it from a modern perspective it's actually a psychological supernatural comedy film with a dash of dark humor. It's really fascinating how time and shifts the tone and mood of a film. I recommend people watching this movie only to see how messed up in a classic Twilight Zone way it is.",Groundhog Day

677,wcsrevu,"""Groundhog Day"": Philosophical/Spiritual Messages",10,2 January 2007,"If I were to classify this film, I think I'd call it ""Romantic Comedy/Fantasy"". But that hardly does it justice. Bill Murray, as the obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, is hilarious, as usual. He was the perfect choice to play the self-centered Phil. To sum up the plot, if you haven't seen it: Phil travels to Punxsutawney, PA with producer Rita (Andie McDowell) & cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) to cover the Annual Groundhog Day Celebration. (A real-life event, by the way.) After covering the celebration, they're stranded there by a blizzard. Phil awakens the next morning, or so he thinks, and soon learns a terrible truth: He's entered some kind of time loop & must live the same day over & over, again & again & again... Phil realizes that he can work this to his advantage. At first, he uses it as an excuse to abandon self-control & avoid responsibility. He takes up some unhealthy & risky habits, knowing that he can start over each day. He soon becomes despondent, however & tries to kill himself several times. Of course, he fails for obvious reasons. Eventually, he starts reaching out to help others in the community, which earns him their respect. In the process, he becomes a better person. But more to the point: Beneath the surface, Groundhog Day has a deeper meaning. The basic premise, in itself, raises the question: What power created the temporal loop in the first place? Was it God, karma or some unknown cosmic force? How long was Phil actually in the loop? Days? Years? Centuries? Would time have any meaning while he was in there? I think the movie purposely leaves these things to our imagination. Why has Phil been ""sentenced"" to relive this day indefinitely? Is it a divine judgment on his character? Is this his ""Hell"" or ""Purgatory""? Is his karma catching up with him? Let's look at how Phil's life is changed by his experience: In the beginning, he's rude, obnoxious & self-centered. Being trapped in the time warp, at first, brings out his negative personality traits when he realizes that his behavior can have no apparent consequences. Some examples: He punches out a pushy insurance salesman. He steals money from an armored truck. He uses women, including Rita (on whom he has a serious crush). He smokes, drinks & overeats. He makes rude comments on-camera at the Groundhog Day Celebration. After several unsuccessful attempts at suicide, Phil begins to soften. He begins using the knowledge he's gained to reach out to others. He soon learns how to be in the right place at the right time to help people in need. Some examples of this: He saves the Groundhog Festival emcee from choking. He catches a little boy who falls out of a tree. He changes a flat tire for some elderly ladies. He comes to the aid of a homeless man & prevents him from dying of a heart attack. He even learns to play the piano & takes up ice sculpting. Phil eventually wins Rita's heart. Then he's released from the temporal loop & time again progresses normally for him. We can see, from this, how Phil Connors learns from his mistakes, changes his attitude & his outlook on life, steps out of his self-centered little world & is finally able to show true love & compassion for others. There's a definite theme of redemption & salvation here, which should appeal to Christians. Because Phil is given countless chances to change his ways, this could symbolize God's infinite mercy. This would appeal to Jews, Christians & Muslims alike. Hindus & Buddhists would appreciate how Phil begins to build up good karma through selfless acts of kindness. Phil's eventually release from the time warp may symbolize a rebirth, reincarnation, an ascension to Heaven or some sort passage into the afterlife. In conclusion, Groundhog Day, besides being a great comedy, is rich in symbolism. We could all learn something from it. I highly recommend watching it. If you've already seen it, see it again (& again & again & ...). Yes, I know it was released in 1993, but it's timeless. (Pun intended.)",Groundhog Day
678,jakebm,A unique and inventive comedy,7,22 October 2001,"Now in 2001 I've just seen Groundhog day for the very first time, on DVD. What a refreshing film. It's very funny in it's repetition and utterly true in it's movements.Perhaps what I enjoyed the most about it was the evolution of Phil (Bill Murray) and the realism of his actions. His responses were predictable on a level. I don't mean that as a criticism but as a positive element. While I didn't always  know what was coming next, I certainly understood on an emotional level. Who wouldn't, after realizing they were living the same day over and over, abuse the power of it. Run from the cops, rob a Brinks truck. But as we progressed, we understood why Phil moved from abuse to improvement. A quality film. 7 out of 10.",Groundhog Day

No...I have watched at least 100 times and I do not exaggerate at all. I am still watching it on DVD of course with any friend who haven't seen it and they love it also.I like every scene I like the wit, homour, story, dialouges, romance and the message.My favourate scene is the hip hop restaurant where Connor discloses that He is A God and wants Rita to believe in Him. Well He knows everything, everybody in town and correctly predicts whats gonna come next.And many other scenes of course. I have become also a Bill Murray fun after the movie but nothing he did achieved the same passion in me.I did not know through all these years that I have been watching the Gorundhog Day over and over again, that the movie has become a shocking hit among the public as opposed to Oscar elite, and I am so happy that it has been underrated by the pundits but embraced by the real DVD watchers.What is left to us is to thank Bill Murray and the Director Harold Ramis for the great job that they did and I hope regardless of the fact that they have not won any significant establishment awards they are happy now...with being over-over and over rated.",Groundhog Day

But I like it.And in the end I'd like to insert my favourite quote from the movie. For me it represents the beautiful side of the movie.""What I wanted to say was......I think you are the kindest......sweetest, prettiest person......I've ever met in my life.I've never seen anyone......that's nicer to people than you are.And the first time I saw you......something happened to me. I never told you......but I knew I wanted to hold you......as hard as I could.I don't deserve someone like you.

It never fails to make me laugh, it never fails to move me as a story, it never fails to impress me as a movie.I haven't read all 397 comments (I do have a life), but in the first couple of pages I noticed nobody spoke of the 7 stages of grief/dying. The screenplay uses this as a plot device. The next time you watch the film (I know you will), check out Murray's character as he goes through 1)Shock/disbelief, 2)Denial, 3)Bargaining, 4)Guilt, 5)Anger, 6)Depression and, finally, 7)Acceptance. Only when he reaches acceptance and becomes the beloved Phil known to the whole town, who loves Rita unconditionally with neither an agenda nor a timetable, do the fates release him to live in the present.The screenplay is positively rife with beautifully understated lines that crack me up. Many commentors have included their favorites. Mine is the bowling alley scene in which the guy responds to Murray and says, ""That about sums it up."" There's a long list of continuity goofs, but there's never been a movie in which they are more inconsequential. It's the massive continuity that does work that's the story here.Easily on my personal Top Ten list.",Groundhog Day
683,csands-4,"Karma, Comedy, and Eternal Recurrence",10,2 February 2008,"Apparently Bill Murray and Harold Ramis fell out over the direction of this film, ending perhaps the most commercially successful working relationship in the history of film comedy (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, etc.). It is hard to understand the dissatisfaction of either with the finished product. The movie is an absolute masterpiece. The writing is brilliant, original and fantastically layered. The story, which details the inner journey of a Pennsylvania weatherman who finds himself living the same day over and over again, is an allegorical representation of spiritual and moral growth that has resonated with people of all religious persuasions. But for those who like their films uncomplicated, unfreighted with symbolic meanings, the movie is enjoyable on any level. There is nothing pretentious about its ambitions. The acting is note-perfect throughout, and Murray's performance is revelatory. He moves effortlessly between slapstick physical comedy, romantic love, and suicidal depression; and any number of emotional states in between. I can't recall a bad performance by Murrray in any movie, but in Groundhog day he hits more high notes than he's ever hit, before or since. It's a shame the Academy has so little respect for comedy, because his performance in this film is better than many an Oscar winner. One of the best films of the 1990s.",Groundhog Day

Its rare that an actor is so suited to a role as in this film.

While the experiences he has in these loops are hilarious, ultimately, its a movie of redemption that will make it one to endure for the ages. Written by Danny Rubin, the film has been prescribed by psychiatrists to their patients and has been the source of essays on the fundamental tenets of many major religions.

694,xemee,How do you spend your eternity?,9,5 August 2003,"A philosophical parable, a sarcastic metaphor, or just a sheer superb Hollywood-molded comedy, are the titles marked by different spectators. No body however can deny its greatness, although it did not win any award -even in the Oscar (may be nominated in that year as I remembered).Groundhog Day tells us quite an ordinary story: a cynical weather reporter has to repeat the same day Feb 2 in a little town he hates most, so he becomes a god, becomes immortal and wildered by this eternal and miserable day- and finally a traditional but never cheesy happy-end. What makes this movie far beyond a comedic clich¨¦? In my point of view, it is the outstanding theme that uplifts this movie. This hilarious movie has a serious and profound theme which bases on Dostoevsky's query If God had died, could we do anything as we like? or the equivalent, Pascals famous saying Without a God, humans degradation turns meaningless.Fantastically and dramatically, this poor reporter Phil Connors (Bill Murray) acquires a privilege (or a damn) to repeat the same day. That means everything he does in this day will have no consequences. When he wakes up in tomorrow morning, all the things happened in yesterday become a dream. Then he has to live through today repeatedly. Therefore, with this exciting privilege, Phil naturally begins to carry out all the actions he wants to do but dare not to do: to beat an annoying man, to gluttonize desserts without fearing heart diseases, to break laws and rile policemen, to steal money and luxuriously live for one day, to coax a lady into one night stand, to chase his female colleague Rita (Andie McDowell). However, before long, he gradually finds all these mischievous or wicked deeds to be insignificant and temporary, hence a mood of tiredness and despair fills Phils mind so that he decides to end his one-day-life. But, ending this nightmare seems not to be easier than behaving badly. He tries everything. He has been stabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hanged, electrocuted and burned. Nevertheless, the next day is still the same Groundhog Day.In this endless torment, Phil becomes to understand that under that circumstance, fame, vanity, lust, money, happiness, sorrow, even life all really turn ephemeral- lasting only one day long- except his mind and thought. To make his transient and eternal life more meaningful, Phil resorts to some grand things- doing good deeds to others. Henceforward, he begins to observe all the people in need, and help them out of trouble in the future. He catches a boy falling down off a tree in an exact time, helps two old ladies repair their car, saves an old man from being chocked¡­ He reads all kinds of books and learns to play piano in order to spend his eternity. Time goes on and on, everyday he repeats these routines cordially and tirelessly until the miracle happens- he finally makes Groundhog Day an end with embracing his love around arms. Phil Connors transcends, not only this torment, but also his past. That line he says is quite impressive: Today is tomorrow. Actually, almost every ordinary man has ever complained that he has to repeat routines and live through a watery everyday life, but not every one has ever tried to put his soul on it, and reap the fruit of the fair life. With the envy of Phils fabulous story, I cannot help asking myself: If I happen to have this trial, how will I spend my eternity? Moreover, this movie affirms an assertion of mine: A mediocre comedy makes you laugh and forget the sadness temporarily whereas an excellent one makes you laugh and confront the ruthless reality intrepidly.Feeling tired of my didactic analysis? Do not be scared. In fact, this Groundhog Day can be everything but a stern sermon. Except for the theme, the nearly perfect performance of actors (esp. Bill Murray), the elaborate and thought-provoking lines, the adept film editing of the director, all make this movie almost flawless. The shortcomings, if there are any, lie in¡­ well, I have tried to point out some, but I fail, because none of them is conspicuous and impeachable.In a word, never miss this Groundhog Day; it will not disappoint you.",Groundhog Day
695,nsolze2,Great Movie!,8,15 December 2010,"Harold Ramis's film ""Groundhog Day"" revolves around bill Murrays character ""Phil"", a miserable weatherman forced to once again go on assignment to Pauxatuany to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. After forcing his way through the day his team encounters a blizzard on the way home which forces them to turn around. He awakes the next day to find that it is the day he just lived. Hilarity ensues and in the end he discovers he must find happiness and his true self before he is able to snap out of his funk. He falls in love with his coworker Rita played by Andie MacDowell and they live happily ever after. The theme of this film kind of reminds me of Jerry McGuire except it is actually funny.Before Phil can overcome his miserable existence and find true happiness he is forced to relive the same day over and over again until he gets it right. Faced with seeing Ned, the annoying insurance salesman, everyday this takes some time. Phil experiences all the ranges of emotions while working to the end product and the director does a great job of taking us through them. He tries everything to get the day to end before realizing that he needs to embrace the day and make the best of it.The author uses several good techniques to reinforce the theme throughout the movie. I feel that ""I got you babe"" music every morning he wakes up is a nice touch in reference to the happiness he finds at the end of the film with Rita. The lighting is also used to reinforce how gloomy and dull both the town of Pauxotowny is and also the existence that Phil is living. While this film is a comedy classic, it also shows a real lesson that people take for granted most of the time. We go to work every day and get into the same rut over and over without putting everything into perspective. This film shows that sometimes we need to take a step back and evaluate what is important to us and spend the time putting it into perspective.",Groundhog Day

He is not happy about covering the story because this is his third year. After doing the story and awaking the following day he discovers that ""Groundhog Day"" is happening all over again, and again, and again. He at first goes crazy about it and then he starts to realize that he can use this to his advantage. He then realizes that he will spend the rest of his life in the same place, with the same people doing the same thing. Phil Conners is the selfish weatherman for the local station WPBH-TV, Pittsburgh. He has no respect for hi co-workers as well as the viewers. He absolutely hates ""Groundhog Day"" which is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil is to cover this event with Rita and Larry who are the new producer and cameraman.

He realizes that this may be his fate but also figures out that his actions have no consequences, but the knowledge can help him gain information about what he wants especially when it comes to Rita. Phil is given ample opportunity time after time to get the day ""right"". Just like in the movie ""50 First Dates"" where a veterinarian has to keep winning the heart of a girl he fell in love with because she has a short term memory. With every new day he has to start over and make sure he gets it right. In this movie the motif is relevant to this movie because it is where they keep repeating the same day. This is important because it helps the view to understand the theme of the movie. The lighting in this movie was high-key lighting which helped create an effective image for the viewers. All Phil Conners had to do was get the day ""right"". Until this happened he would keep reliving the same day.

700,mail-joydip,Rare comedy movie with great philosophical undertone,8,22 March 2015,"Just after watching Primer, quite a complex film on time loops (List of films featuring time loops), I decided to watch Groundhog Day, a romantic comedy.~~ Spoilers below ~~This movie also features time loop where the protagonist ""Phil"" gets stuck in a tight time loop where he wakes up, again and again on 2nd Feb, the Groundhog day. Whatever he does on that day, goes away the next morning where he starts afresh. Only he has the memory and awareness of this loop. For everything and everyone else, this is a fresh start. For example, if he breaks a clock, the next morning it will be renewed, same with breaking somebody else's nose. Only he would have the memory of breaking the stuff. When he realizes this, as expected, he tries to get the max out of this situation in a hedonistic way. As none of his actions would lead to any consequences, he can now do whatever he wants. He also uses his ability to have multiple passes to the same events, gather larger world knowledge and use it to his advantage (securing a date for example). While doing so, he realizes his actual love for Rita, his co-worker. But however he might want to impress her, things just does not work out. He then contemplates suicide. And does it. But however he tries, he wakes up just the same at 6 am on Groundhog day. There is just no tomorrow for him.Once he is completely bored with suicides, he tries to build up skills. He learns, ice sculptures, piano, car mechanic's job and many different things. With multiple repetitions, he also has much more knowledge about the stuffs that happen on the small town. He uses these two knowledge to help many people around him. And finally, with all these, he manages to win the heart of Rita. Once he does that, tomorrow comes back to his life. He wakes up on 3rd February.That being the story, there are many philosophical, spiritual and metaphorical undertones in this movie.First, the repeat of 2nd Feb in Phil's life, in some way is a metaphor to our own materialistic, repetitive, absurd and boring days. And unless we do something significant, like learning piano like a pro, or helping out someone from choking, or finally getting our dream date, there is just no tomorrow for us. What we see as tomorrow is just the repeat of yesterday. As it comes out from this conversation between Phil and Ralph whom he meets at the café. Phil: What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered? Ralph: That about sums it up for me.Each day, learn something new, feel something new, do something new. Make sure today you do something different from yesterday.It also touches life in another philosophical sense. Like Phil's 2nd Feb, our own life may very well be as pointless and may lack purpose, that does not mean we won't do our work or would not try to be a better person. Our life may be as pointless as the life of Sisyphus; but that does not mean we need to be unhappy about it. ""This story of a man doomed to relive the same day over and over again is not concerned about tomorrow. A true absurdist triumph, it cares not what the destination might be, for it knows that the pursuit of meaning is itself meaningful whether or not that pursuit is eventually rewarded.[1]"" Just like it is told in Karma yoga.It also has a spiritual and philosophical undertone. Each 2nd Feb in Phil's life seems to be corresponding to the life. And just like Phil, we are stuck in endless cycle of birth and death, bound to the wheel of time until we get the promotion to next level [2].Overall it's a great movie. A simple take on a complex subject such as time loop. Go watch it.References: [1] http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/imagining-sisyphus-happy- a-groundhog-day-retrospective [2] http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-groundhog-day-1993",Groundhog Day

It is hard to fathom another actor who audiences have the patience to sit through and watch a man, over and over again, fail miserably at winning the girl's heart. Phil's transformation from a demon to a saint is well accommodated by Bill Murray's physical versatility. He can portray a ""glass half empty"" character and still be left with grace, or he can bring out a believable kindhearted soul that audiences follow with admiration. It is my opinion that Harold Ramis did not directly create the character, but let Bill Murray manifesting himself into the character of Phil Conners. I know very little about Harold Ramis' creative techniques, but I do know that he is a great man for making the executive decision to place his old friend Bill Murray into this role. I am speaking out of my rear end and this is just my opinion, so if there is any discrepancies do not write a counter comment please. Bottom line: Led by Harold Ramis, Bill Murray needs to team up with Andie Mac Dowell once again and create ""Another Groundhog Day"".",Groundhog Day
704,hugo-c-castelo,"More than a funny movie, a life lesson",10,14 September 2012,"On this movie, Bill Murray ends up stuck in a rather boring day of his life. He's unhappy with his job and is covering by the third time in a row an event that has no meaning to him. At first he's skeptical and shocked with everything that's happening. He just wanted that day to end since the beginning. His plan was to get there on the night before, sleep, do his jog and go back to his city as soon as possible. But a snowstorm closes the road and his group is forced to spend one more night there and this night is the one that starts to repeat the day making Bill's character stuck. When he realizes what's happening and that there's nothing he can do about it he just stop caring. He drinks, smokes, mock the coverage and the city, steal and do everything he wouldn't do if he knew that the time would pass as normal. He tries to learn about things to use this knowledge in his favor. He ends up knowing everything about the city, the schedule, people's life and preferences. With that he's able to make the day go exactly as he wants to. Eventually he grow tired of it all and just want things to be normal again. Sure it was fun to lie and live the life as nothing bad could happen to him but he misses what we all got, the possibility of a future. And the great lesson we can get from the movie is to try. You don't need to live like this day is going to repeat forever but instead of wait and think about the consequences of your acts just do it. If you wanna do something, get out there and do it. If you don't do it you'll be like Bill's character but in a bad way. The days are going to pass but you'll be stuck always doing the same thing.",Groundhog Day

It is really one of those movies that will stay with you throughout the years. I think we have all wanted to be able to go back and re-do a day or two in our lives until we get it right. I love that there is a happy ending. Bill Murray is a comic genius in my mind and it always entertaining to watch. I think I was about 7 when this movie came out and I was one of those kids that would watch a movie on repeat for weeks on end and this was one of my favorites. I think this movie truly stands the test of time. I wish I could say the same for half the movies that have been released in the last five years. Sometimes the effects just mask a poorly written movie.",Groundhog Day
706,monkeyboyhagan,An outstanding comedy-fantasy film,10,16 June 2015,"Groundhog Day is an outstanding comedy-fantasy film about an egotistical TV weatherman named Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, who resents being forced by his Pittsburgh news producer to head to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania and cover the reveal of whether the groundhog will see his shadow on Groundhog's Day. Thinking he's a god amongst women, he assumes his travel producer Rita, played by Andie MacDowell, lusts after him and he can't help but take pot shots at his cameraman Larry, played by Chris Elliott. Once Phil has completed his day and is trapped overnight in Punxsutawney due to a blizzard closing down the highway back to Pittsburgh, he ends up in a time loop that forces him to repeat the same day over and over. He seems to be the only person who remembers already going through that day previous and even when he gets so desperate as to kill himself, he continually wakes up at 6AM on Groundhog Day back in his bed and breakfast room.The movie focuses itself around the theme that to really achieve anything in life we must let go of ourselves and open up to those around us. Phil remains self-centered through much of the film. After he first tries repeated attempts to kill himself due to the imagined torture of spending eternity repeating a day he deems miserable, he continues to make the same mistakes as he takes advantage of the knowledge he gains to seduce Rita and steal money from an armored car.For much of the movie, the lighting is pretty drab. Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, at least through Phil's eyes, is very dull. Setting the movie on Groundhog Day in Pennsylvania as opposed to Miami Beach on the Fourth of July was obviously not just a coin flip by the writers. We are supposed to see the same dull, blandness that Phil sees and this lighting in Pennsylvania in February is very believable. In fact, we barely get even a hint of sunlight until the very end when Groundhog Day finally ends and life for Phil continues, lesson learned.The camera angles in this movie really reveal a lot about Phil as well. Much of the time we are looking up at him even if just slightly. This gives the impression that he's bigger than he really is and points to his inflated ego. When the camera cuts back and forth between Phil and whoever he is talking to in over-the-shoulder shots, we are looking from Phil's view down toward the person he is speaking with and up toward Phil from the opposite angle. On characters like Rita, this could be passed off as being because she is much shorter than Phil. But this angle is even used on characters the same height as Phil, such as Ned Ryerson. The exception to this is the Sheriff that closes the highway in the blizzard. In this case, the camera angle looking up from Phil toward him indicates the Sheriff's power but we also notice that we don't see any of Phil in these shots. As Phil starts to change his ways toward the end of the movie, the camera no longer looks down on the others but even Rita, who is obviously shorter, is shot from a lower angle as well making all the characters appear to be on level playing field with Phil.The film has a similar theme as another Bill Murray movie, Scrooged, which of course was based on the Charles Dickens' story A Christmas Carol. In both films, Murray plays a self-absorbed man who learns he must change his ways, however, Groundhog Day does a much better job with its message. This movie you can easily see the true struggle Phil must go through to open himself up to those around him and think about everyone else instead of himself for a change.",Groundhog Day

I love this movie,not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For example,you realize that how many fail do you in a day. And you realize if you had a chance to live your day again,you would do everything more good. You are witness that Murray's character Phil learns and grows and becomes a better person. He is living same day repeatedly. And he became better,lovely person.

708,sullivan5485,Romantic comedy with a twist!,8,4 May 2013,"Harold Ramis's ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) is a romantic comedy that is filled with laughter, love, and at times a feeling of hopelessness, over and over again. ""Groundhog Day"" is a about a local, self-centered weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has been sent to cover the infamous February 2nd festivities, better known as Groundhog Day, in a small town named Punxsutawney, Pa. Teamed with his lovely, well- grounded producer named Rita (Andie MacDowell) and his young, wise cracking cameraman named Larry (Chris Elliot), the three make the annual pilgrimage from Pittsburg to Punxsutawney for this historic event.We all know the story behind the famous date of February 2nd. If the ""weather predicting rat"" (groundhog) as Phil calls it, comes out from its burrow and sees his shadow then it's another 6 weeks of winter. If no shadow appears, then happy days are here because spring is near. Although Phil has been to the small town of Punxsutawney five times to cover the festivities, he does not intend to spend any longer than necessary to uncover the story, announce the prediction and get back on the road to Pittsburg. Phil wraps up the story, Larry packs the van and the three get on the road to head home. Here lies the problem, a winter storm is brewing and moving in the direction of Punxsutawney. The crew did not make it far before the road was closed by the Highway Patrol and were directed to return to Punxsutawney much to Phil's dislike. This is where Phil's vicious loop of the dreaded February 2nd begins.The storyline of ""Groundhog Day"" closely reminds us of the film ""Yes Man"" (2008) starring Jim Carrey as Carl Allen. In this story, Carl has committed to saying ""yes"" to everything. Soon he understands the magical power of the word yes"" and his life is turned upside, sideways, and all around. Soon, Carl discovers a new love in his life, Allison, played by Zooey Deschanel and attempts to convince her that his love for her is real and he is not just saying that under this magical spell. Groundhog Day allows Phil to relive February 2nd over and over again. This motif gives Phil the latitude to develop his character during the film. He learns to be a better person through caring for an elderly gentleman, taking piano lessons, and reading more books and poetry. His sense of maturity is soon recognized by his attractive producer and sparks an interest to him. During this film there was not much use of lighting and colors. This could have been partly because of the mood that Phil Connors was feeling in addition to the dreariness of the nearby winter storm. This lack of lighting gave the appearance the days were meek and mild with overcast.Many times the camera angle gave the impression that they were stationary utilizing an objective point of view just to observe the action. However, there were times during the film when the cameras would pan overhead to recognize a crowd gathering at Gobblers Knob or give a subjective point of view like when Phil steals Punxsutawney Phil and drives over the cliff at the rock quarry. When Phil appeared in his bed every morning, the film crew utilized a high camera to stare down at Phil as he was lying in his bed before his alarm clock would go off at 6:00 am.No matter how many times you see this film, it will leave a lasting impression. The term ""groundhog day"" has become part of the free dictionary meaning a situation that repeats itself. This film is entertaining providing good, clean, wholesome comedy with a romantic twist that appears to never end.",Groundhog Day

The supporting cast just superb with all members putting in excellent performances backing Bill up with just impeccable comedy timing, probably with some help from the director, maybe not.

More than a thousand and it is much better than most of them. One of the better aspects of this movie is its humor. It is rich, intelligent and never vulgar. There are some romantic scenes, they are not my favorites but I have seen worst. I forgot to tell the movie genre it is a comedy mostly with romance and some philosophical themes. The main actor is Bill Murray who gives a stronger performance in his comedies (like Ghostbuster) than many other actors. I could even say than it is his best and more nuanced performance. I have never felt such different emotions than when watching this movie. It is much better than other comedies of the 90's. Watch it! It will make you cry, laugh and ultimately think.",Groundhog Day
712,levine02,Great movie! Well written and produced!,8,5 August 2013,"The film Groundhog Day takes place in Pennsylvania and is based around an annual celebration of Groundhogs Day itself. Bill Murray plays a person named Phil Connors who seems to be an arrogant self-centered individual who does not want to utilize his profession to cover this event. He works alongside his news producer named Rita who is played by actress Andie MacDowell. Phil Connors also has a cameraman for the news station named Larry who is played by Chris Elliott. Phil Connors shows up at the Groundhog Day event to do the coverage of this event even though he is not wanting to. Phil Connors plays a meteorologist in this film and he does not predict the weather right on this day. A big snowstorm hits the small town in Pennsylvania where he is covering the Groundhog Day events. When this occurs Phil keeps reliving the same day over and over again.Phil tries numerous things to get out of the time loop and one of these things is committing suicide just about every day. Once he realizes he cannot get out he decides to take advantage of this situation in a negative manner. He begins breaking the law by driving intoxicated, stealing money from people and taking advantage of women. He then realizes he has feelings for his news producer Rita which then turns everything around. Phil then develops what I would say is a hero's complex and begins doing well. By the end of the film he is a changed man and has a different view on his life as well as life with others. The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change.Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things ""right."" This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.",Groundhog Day

I think that this movie is just perfect: You have everything in it from Romance to Comedy to sometimes really deep topics. I also like the soundtrack and one very special thing: although the movie was, as far as I now, a hit, they never did a sequel, which is absolutely right, because this movie is one of the rare ones, that are absolutely self-contained. Bill Murray is a great actor and gives his best. You see his perfect play very good in the scene when they build the snowman the second time - the constrained way he acts, when he falls down to the ground and tries to come closer to Rita as naturally as the day before.

However, I think that for some reason, the people that gravitate toward this film also tend to be ""karma sympathizers"", slightly Hindu, or at least appreciate the spiritual parallels.If someone as cynical as Bill (Phil) can be redeemed on the day where for thousands of years, a small little animal has to choose between the dark and the light, than anyone watching knows they too can go out and be a better person. I had forgotten it was Paxsutawney Phil's day to shine till I looked at the news today, but just remembering that film, and its story line makes me want to go out and do something nice for my kids today.

716,kristinkling,Sexist Hollywood garbage,1,6 March 2018,"Groundhog Day is a movie about a creepy shtbag who relives the same day over and over and uses that inconvenience to gaslight and manipulate women into thinking that he's not a creepy shtbag. In some alternative universe (1993?) this is apparently supposed to be funny or romantic. Imagine how many women viewers have been fed this ""your love can change the a**hole""-narrative over the decades. As per usual in this genre, all the women are also portrayed as sex-objects who are either airheads or without much of a personality. Not to mention the illogical time-concept where he bumps into the exact same people in the same place despite having skipped events, unlike the day before. The protagonist clearly isn't the sharpest knife in the box, considering that he never even made a serious effort to leave town and go to bed somewhere else to see if the time loop is bound to the hotel/town where he's visiting. Apart from the rampant sexism and lack of logic, you can also predict the ending about half way into the movie. This movie is hardly alone in pushing the very destructive ""it's just part of the romance when a guy is being a dipsht to you""-agenda, and that is exactly what is so terrifying. The frequency with which this agenda is pushed in this genre is partly why so many people can watch a movie like this without recognizing the problem of that this sexist dramaturgy both mirrors and contributes to creating sexist values in our society. Pure Hollywood garbage that should never have made in to the big screen.",Groundhog Day
717,ssenyuk,Life changing Movie. How to make a new breathe into your life,10,3 February 2015,"It's an excellent movie! - 20 years passed and its still actual and interesting! And this tradition of groundhog day its still going on. - An interesting thing that groundhogs name is the same as the man's name in the main role, and they are both weather forecasters :) - The curious thing is that the main character passes through several stages from the first state when he hates his job, the people that surround him, environment, he hates his life. And people that surround him also feel it, they feel negative energy from him, his egocentric nature. And when every day your life repeats, when nothing changing around you, you lose your desire to live. And then the second state - the main hero tries to satisfy his own desires, having every time in the world. But this didn't work for him. Then the third state he begins to learn new skills, to get new knowledge. It helps, but not satisfy him, nothing changes. And finally he understands that most important thing is to help others, to save more lives, to make more people happier. And from selfish man, that he was at first, he becomes a generous, very kind, and altruistic person. And the moral of this movie is that our life, given to us by God, is not for only satisfying our material needs and selfish desires, but for helping others, saving lives, learning and developing ourselves, making this world better and people in it more happier.",Groundhog Day

Andie McDowell is a great heroine pushing and making the story line come to life. My children have grown to love the movie as much as I do, and have laughed at different parts as they matured. There're so many nuances, and moments that get found and that are anticipated that you laugh the moment before it happens. I marvel at the timing and movement as you are drawn through the growth and changes faced by this unwilling human ( Phil Conners)as he faces life head on.

This is a rare quality that I have only seen with a few other movies: ""Fargo"", ""Cape Fear"" (the one with DeNiro), and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" It is similar to how you would feel if you were able to see a film of close friends in an entertaining story. You feel as you know the people and the place. Fantastic! Bill Murray is Outstanding!! Chris Elliot is a funny supporting character. Andie McDowell, however, leaves question as to Bill Murray's Characters taste in women (a little too angelic for my taste - doesn't fit at all with his character).

Phil Conners is a weatherman that is sent to Punxsutawney to cover the Groundhog Day festivities for his local news station. Accompanying Phil are his producer Rita and his cameraman Larry. Phil finds the assignment in Punxsutawney to be beneath him and wants to get in and out as fast as possible, unfortunately, the weather does not cooperate and they find themselves stranded in Punxsutawney.Begrudgingly, Phil spends the night in Punxsutawney and when he wakes up, he finds himself reliving Groundhog Day. He is the only person that knows what is happening and he goes through several different stages. He tells Rita that he is a God, he gets depressed and tries to kill himself, and finally, he accepts his fate and starts to better him. He grows fond of the people of the small Pennsylvania town. He eventually learns to play the piano as well as create ice sculptures. Eventually, Phil becomes such a good person and Rita falls in love with him. That results in Phil waking up in his bed, and discovering that it is February 3rd. I feel the theme of this movie is that if we seek true happiness, we must first be happy with ourselves. By the end of the movie, Phil is no longer a grump and has genuinely changed for the better. He is happy.Bill Murray, who plays Phil, is an excellent choice for the lead because of his ""everyman"" appearance. He does an excellent job portraying Phil going through the stages on his way to acceptance and eventually happiness. The tone of the movie changes as Phil's feelings about his fate change. There is an ominous tone early in the film with the storm. That switches to a light hearted tone when Phil is having fun with his new found fate. He steals money from an armored car, seduces an attractive woman, and gorges on desserts with no fear of repercussions. As depression sets in, the tone of the film turns dark again. Phil tries to kill himself in a variety of ways. Finally, when Phil decides that real change and growth are needed, the movie reflects that with a jubilant tone.",Groundhog Day
723,imdb-186-825273,"The ""tightest"" movie I've seen, underrated too",10,17 February 2020,"(It's a shame this film is not on the IMDB top 250, as it is better than most on that list. The Academy was AWOL as well, only the Brits were sharp enough to award it.)Granted the core story-idea of this film is not epic, and a bit silly on the surface. It's no ""Gone with the Wind,"" as they say. Just a lighthearted, low-key popcorn movie. But given this, you get the best screenplay, character development, dialogue, acting, editing (etc) possibly built on such a foundation. And it's not just technical-poignancy and heart abound. Film students take note.So, why is it tight, an odd way to describe a movie, no? I'm reminded of this famous quote: ""Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.""-Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.There is essentially zero wasted time in this gem of a film, it's just under an hour and forty minutes of focused storytelling with perfect pacing. Every scene supports the narrative, every line is great to better. There's no special effects or other filler. There are however dozens hilarious moments that continue to be after repeated viewings. Contrast this with any favorite modern-day film that should have been an hour shorter.Performances/dialogue are fantastic. Another full review celebrates Murray's ""understated a-hole"" delivery, I'll simply concur. MacDowell is adorable, sweet, and borderline annoying at first, but definitely grows on you. Only Elliot's (the David Letterman cameraman) performance is a bit self-conscious, but he still nails the resentful-nerd angle.Even minor characters in the town get substantial development all things considered. We immediately grasp everyone's motivations, so believable that they feel like old friends. I'm currently thinking of the two guys at the bowling alley, straight out of a ""Strange Brew"" sketch going nowhere fast, ""that about sums it up for me."" (Lolz) But what about (Murray's brother) Buster choking on a meatball, the thankful little old lady trio, the poor old bum about to meet his maker, the proud music teacher, the doctor, the bartender's knowing looks, the groundhog!? And who can forget ""Needle-nose Ned's"" iconic scenes. Bing!It's hard not to fall in love with every single person in this cute little town. Am I right, am I right, or am I right?It's a delightful slice of one day in a small town, a fantasy, a romantic comedy, a celebration of life, and a call for continuous improvement all in one.

Murry can forget Saturday Night Live fame, it's this cult-status movie that has made him. He's been in some good movies of late but has never been better than in Groundhog Day. In a fair world he'd have a Best Actor Oscar for this effort.",Groundhog Day
729,shawnpg,"Best Flick Ever, had me ROTFL",10,15 November 2016,"This movie was the most clever comedy ever written. The do-over style story telling just kept building with no climax in sight. I just could not focus on this whole film the first time because of the tears in my eyes. Bill Murray already was a great name to add to the cast. He has been a top A-list actor in several comedies and dramas up to the point of this flick. His deadpan approach to his character just brought a realistic scenario to the out-of-this-world story line. The cast selected balanced out his nonchalant personae just right. If I could give it 100 stars out of 10 I would. Not only will it be tough to beat this films comedy style, but it will be tough to cast someone as brilliant as Bill. Simply my favorite film ever.",Groundhog Day

731,hiphopemil,Inspiring,9,19 May 2018,"It is fascinating to watch a film with massive fame running before itself. Usually because you get the sense that your opinion on the film is of great importance, due to how people would view you afterwards. For a critic, this dilemma is routine. With this in mind, I am happy to announce that Groundhog Day somehow managed to not only fulfil my expectations, but also exceed them greatly. It is impressive how far a good script can carry a film. Although it is not the only thing worth crediting, I will not hesitate to say that the screenplay is the strongest asset this film has at its disposal. The film wields its characters and idyllic Pennsylvanian town with great strength and confidence, which it certainly should be. And the central concept of a day forever repeating itself works much better than I could ever have anticipated. It takes a mind to create an idea, but it takes a great mind to carry it to the finish line. 
And that is exactly what Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis did with this film. 
Well deserving of being credited a modern classic.",Groundhog Day

734,dacinbna,The best,10,15 September 2005,"This movie is incredible. It is definitely my favorite movie of all time. It's one of those films that could not be pulled off by any other actor.... only Bill Murray could fit this role as Phil Conners, and he fits it perfectly. The incredible extent of his whimsical acting in this film is 80% of what makes it one of the greatest films I have ever seen... the other 20% belonging to the great storyline and supporting characters.This movie can be viewed at any time and still liked. It is a peaceful movie, if you are in relaxed spirits. It is especially great for those nights when you just got home from work or school and the day didn't go as you wanted it to, and you feel though as if life is struggle to no end. This movie is about second chances, and outside of the incredible humor, can be inspiring to get every day of your life right, and to remember the things that are most important in life.Watch it, and see what you think!",Groundhog Day

736,benboeck,A Great Watch,8,27 February 2017,"Groundhog Day is work a work of marvelous comedy. This comedy exudes from the natural inclination to be humored by the hysterical facial expressions and the unfortunate situations Phil, Bill Murray, is placed in along the ride. It uses the somewhat mind boggling circumstance that the comical Bill Murray is stuck in time, and the situations involving romanticism, death, anarchy, and other natural human desires that may not be the best in certain situations. These experiences Phil finds himself creates not only just amusement and a reason to laugh, but also they make us think and feel for how we would've responded to such a phenomenon as defying space and time. Inspiring us with its progressive attitude of growth and morals, it makes us want to be better people and to mature, hopefully in a far less amount of time that repeating a single day hundreds of times. It exceeds in not just reaching those who want a good laugh, but also accomplishes speaking, through film, to those facing romantic struggles, depression, a weak will to live, and other such issues most humans experience throughout their lifetime. Though it did achieve a lot with such a small concept, related to humanities struggles, and gave us hope for a matured self, I could not reconcile the fact that Rita, Phil's love in the end (played by Andy McDowell), would settle for a man such as Phil. The movie also was vague, other than the fact that Phil had been a jerk and a prideful snob, about the reason that Phil had been sentenced to such a temporary fate as he was in Groundhog Day but it doesn't shed much light off of the great film that it is. It struts many of the great concepts of comedy that we all know and love and influences us to be better people. All in all, it is a stand-up movie that will not disappoint after a lazy night of movie-watching!",Groundhog Day

I personally think movies should contain certain theme and messages that we can observe.

There were some few laughing points that entertained me, but it was more like a B class comedy film.",Groundhog Day

Bill Murray did very well . When he knew he could live in this day all the time ,he did something that any guys would do: First,sex ; (very easy) Second,a lot of money; (not hard ) Third,a woman he love (very hard ) so,although he knew a lot of things about ""Rita"" ,but he found that the love of woman is very hard to get .In fact ,he understood something should be changed in himself ,and he should know himself , understand the value of people's life and even the meaning of true love .So, he tried to change himself ,and he did it in the end . From all of comments above ,we even can get a standard way of many guys ,they work very hard ,they earn money for fun or sex ,but they can't get true love of woman he love .It's so sarcastic,isn't it? 'Cause that need a big change in himself ,it's the most hard thing,nobody like change ,it's truth ,but they did it in the end just for true love of the woman. so,I think the movie show one guy's quality really.",Groundhog Day

I realized, I'm not too fond of the message of the film.SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!! Don't read unless you've seen the movie.The ending has a hazy meaning / message. That Phil had to manipulate this woman to fall in love with him? I mean he had to also become the most amazing human being that ever existed... I would even say that makes her a bit shallow as well! I still enjoy it, but I'm just bothered by the ending now .If you've never seen it before though, it is DEFINITELY worth the watch!",Groundhog Day
742,justinleonconder,The Transformation of Phil Connors,9,4 March 2020,"When I was young I loved Groundhog Day because of Bill Murray, and all things Bill Murray were life to me. Every couple years I would watch it and it would reveal to me new things about life. This year I watched it, and as I basked in the glow of the amazing ending, I realized exactly why this film means so much to me. Why it is Harold Ramis' best work, and Bill Murray's best performance. It is about time, transformation, and the weather. It is about love, but it is also about becoming a person who truly loves others, and accepting oneself and circumstances beyond one's control to find happiness within. It's about the beauty of ice sculptures, and becoming unstuck in yourself.The thing to understand is that I never bought the ending of Charles Dickens' The Christmas Carol. I have never accepted Paul-on-the-road-to-Damascus, instantaneous conversion stories. My general experience has been: people's personalities tend to remain largely the same over time. So Ebenezer Scrooge's sudden overnight shift in personality was just not believable to me. In all adaptations of the Christmas Carol (including Scrooged, in which Bill Murray also plays the old miser), the happy ending and redeemed villain never landed for me. Through fear and regret imposed by supernatural entities, Scooge gets up on Christmas a new human being - seemingly having undergone a brain transplant with Sérgio de Mello. He's a rich philanthropist now, and brings joy to the hearts of children. All the work of one night. Huh. . . uh, no.But the transformation of Phil Connors in Groundhog Day lands for me. And the catharsis of this transformation and what it suggests about life is the heart of this film. The weatherman Phil Connors begins in the story as an egotist, a careerist, a condescending, bitter, sexist, and selfish person. But even here there is a note of promise: Phil admits to his love interest Rita (played with miraculous grace by Andie McDowell) that he doesn't like himself. Phil reluctantly goes to the Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival, a task he considers beneath him. He despises the ""hick"" town and treats everyone with sarcasm or barely concealed contempt.When the time loop begins, Phil becomes trapped on February 2. Everyone else is now following the same deterministic path and time schedule and conversations as the ""previous"" day. The only variable is Phil himself - he has the agency to change the course of events, and he knows what is coming. The trouble is that each morning he wakes up in the bed and breakfast in Punxsutawney at 6:00 am to Sonny and Cher's ""I Got You Babe"" and all the actions have been reset. The only thing that is retained is Phil's memory and experiences.At first Phil is shocked, naturally. Soon he sees how powerful he is and begins taking advantage of people - thieving, seducing women, driving recklessly, and indulging a hedonistic lifestyle. But soon its clear that he really wants love - he learns everything he can about his producer Rita, and attempts to woo her. But each time she sees through his shallow maneuvers and into the emptyness of his soul. He becomes bereft, suicidal. He even kidnaps the groundhog itself and drives off a cliff to a fiery fate. But he cannot die: each time he ends his life he reawakens to February 2 once again. Trapped in a hellish limbo, a Nietzschean Eternal Return, Phil begins to slowly accept his fate.And then. By degrees and by experiences, Phil starts the miracle of transformation. The crucible of Groundhog Day has destroyed the old Phil and something new is emerging from the ashes. It begins with accepting that someone like him doesn't deserve Rita, as he is - she is a kind and loving person, and he is not. Slowly, Phil begins the process of being a better person through action. He helps strangers with their problems, saves lives, heals relationships, and betters himself by learning piano and ice sculpture. He begins to love the town of Punxsutawney and its inhabitants, not as means to end, but for themselves. And he does all this not in order to gain Rita's affections, but in order to finally accept himself.He also accepts his limitations. Phil is not a god: just as he cannot force Rita to love him, he cannot save everyone. He tries to save a homeless man in various ways from dying - but each day he fails. Phil may be trapped in immortality but he is not omnipotent.The movie never fully explains what caused the time loop or what caused it to end. There are various fan theories and speculations, and I actually prefer the ambiguity surrounding it. But I do like to think that what broke the loop was the final piece of Phil's metamorphosis. The moment he tells Rita next to her ice sculpture that, ""No matter what happens tomorrow or for the rest of my life, I'm happy now. Because I love you."" This sad scene always brings me near tears: Phil has accepted that this time and place are all he has, a brief candle to spend with Rita. But the key is that he has accepted himself and is happy with himself, as he is. He has become a person worthy of love. Rita, for her part, sees the good man that Phil actually is, and is drawn to him. He doesn't tell her about the time loop anymore, or try to win her by superficial means. He is honest and generous in his spirit.At that very moment, the weather changes for the first time in years (it's unclear how long Phil's been trapped, but probably about 40 years). This is the moment the loop breaks and Phil becomes unstuck in himself, in my opinion.He awakens the next day and it is February 3. Rita is beside him. Allow me to return briefly to Scrooge. When Scrooge awakens he throws open the window, rushes through town, furiously righting wrongs and deliriously trying to undo years of curmudgeonly behavior. But Phil Connors rushes to the window and sees the new day has come, and rushes back to bed with Rita. He asks her what he can do for her today. Here is the distinction: Phil is already a transformed man, a good man. He changed in just a day. . . one very long day. But we see through Bill Murray's incredible performance that this is the same man from the beginning, but transfigured. We saw the pain and tumultuousness of that transfiguration, like the changing of weather patterns. The blizzard has cleared and last and we see a blue sky. So we know this change is real and lasting. What's more, the last line of Groundhog Day is: ""Let's live here.""The miracle of Groundhog Day is not the supernatural time loop, or the ending of the time loop. There are no warnings from spirits of the past or future. It is always now in Groundhog Day. And the time for transformation is always in the now. The miracle of Groundhog Day is the transformation of one human being, and that is why it is one of my favorite films of all.",Groundhog Day

746,landscaping-guide,Can be understood without knowing much background info on the holiday; but such info makes for a richer movie-watching experience.,10,31 January 2006,"Groundhog Day is a holiday with deep roots in the pagan past. It is our only holiday whose theme is weather. It occurs at a time of year when weather occupies our thoughts more thoroughly than at any other time of the year. We know we're still stuck in winter, but enough of the winter has elapsed that we now feel justified in looking ahead to the promise of the spring equinox.More than any other holiday, Groundhog Day is the ""looking-ahead"" holiday. We're not so much celebrating the present on February 2 as we are a day in the not-too-distant future, the spring equinox (a very important time in the lives of ancient peoples). The spring equinox is simply being celebrated ahead of time, as Groundhog Day, on February 2. Asking us to bottle up our hopes until three weeks in March have passed would be be just plain unreasonable, right? This analysis helps explain all the talk of ""forecasting"" on Groundhog Day. But it isn't the Groundhog who's looking ahead, it is we. And whether it arrives early, late or on-time, this is one prediction that inevitably will prove true: spring will arrive, one way or another -- it always has. And on Groundhog Day we take solace in that fact.As I imply in my article, ""Groundhog Day and the Groundhog Day Movie"" the latter can be fully understood only in this context. Like the holiday itself, the ""Groundhog Day"" movie is all about transition. Sure, you can discern the transition without knowing much background at all about the holiday; but such knowledge improves the experience of watching the movie.Then again, ""Groundhog Day"" can be appreciated on many levels. Superficially, it can be enjoyed as a romantic comedy; Bill Murray makes it work on this level. But for those with a philosophical bent, it is a very profound movie. Some have even suggested a connection with Nietzsche's teaching of the Eternal Recurrence.",Groundhog Day

Outdoor oompah music becomes fitting to the flow.

748,h-86219,Will your 3rd Feb. come? 60816 1101 Zhou Yuhan,6,13 October 2018,"Last Monday,I watched a film called Groundhog Day,which leaves me a deep impression on the fantasy and romance containing in it. Although released in 1993,the film has an incredible insight into life in 21st century. The hero Phil is played by Bill Murray,while Andie,the actress,characterizes Rita's features vividly. Directed by Harold Ramis,the film has won 6 wins and 17 nominations. You won't be regret to enjoy it.
 The story begins normally,a weatherman with his team is going to cover the annual Groundhog festivities in Punxsutawney. However,the arrogance inside Phil and the ordinary village become contradictory,which drives the next actions. Ironically,Phil finds out that he awakes at 6 every morning,and then,suffer from the same day, 2nd Feb. He cannot leave the town,nor commit a suicide. Sometimes tricks are played,to date a woman or make fun of others. Gradually,he fills himself by learning skills and helping people in need. Subtle changes eventually make him a better person. At last,Rita falls in love with this kind man and 3rd Feb. comes.
 Murray portray the role Phil in a particular way. When he realizes that he have to undertake the same day again,first he shows unbelievable,then there is curiosity and boredom. All of these,psychological actions are presented by Murray's gestures and facial expressions. Nevertheless,Rita's part is also attractive since she is the main point of Phil's life. The shift attitude of the supporting roles matters undoubtedly. In all,their acting performance is successful through the gradations.
 The film techniques are rather simple but meaningful. One repeated and classical shot is the 6:00 a.m. clock. The clock turns 6 and music begins,then we all know the same day misery happens again. More interestingly,because the film shoots repeated scene,every decorations and locations of actors must be accurately right. I suppose that was a tolerant.
 The first theme is apparent,which teaches us to treasure and to be a good person.And the second one is my own assumption. In contemporary life,many people live exhaustedly and numbly,have nothing changed,thus no passion for life and their 3rd Feb. never comes. They just live one day for a thousand times,instead of living a thousand days for themselves. This is quite alarming,and makes us rethink.
 Many successes are mentioned,though the repeated plots seem to be a little boring. In conclusion,this is a movie that suits lovers and friends at weekend. I will give six stars out of ten.

Or, would you indulge yourself in drinking, eating and sleeping? You would not only live the same day over and over again but you would be endowed with immortality. Even if you commit suicide, you will wake up the same morning, intact and unharmed. Could you fall in love? What would be the point of living? You would memorize everything that will happen on that particular day. You would know what time, who would be where and for what reason.
