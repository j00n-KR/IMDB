0,TheLittleSongbird,Quite simply movie-making on the grandest scale,10,18 April 2010,"At 17, I love David Lean, his films are filled with beautiful images and he also directs with real flair. Lawrence of Arabia is a perfect example of movie-making at its finest, the whole film is absolutely phenomenal in every aspect: Whether it is the film's visual style. Lawrence of Arabia is filled with absolutely beautiful images, such as the mirage that introduced us to Omar Sharif. I don't think this could be possible without the astounding cinematography, or the stunning, picturesque Morrocan, Saudi Arabian, Spanish and English locations. The shots of the desert were visually jaw dropping and the battle scenes are unforgettable. But that is the thing with Lean, all of the films I have seen of his are visually stunning, Passage to India, Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, Brief Encounter and Bridge on the River Kwai all but to name a few.Whether it is the film's music score. I used to listen with real enthusiasm to Classic FM at the Movies every Saturday (on the radio that is), and along with the main theme of Gone With the Wind, the score's main theme was one of the main themes that stuck out most. Maurice Jarre's score is nothing short of outstanding, swift, sweeping, epic and even iconic. I could very well say it is probably one of my all time favourite movie scores.Whether it is the film's screenplay. The screenplay is intelligent and is like a withering satire on the mentality of Lawrence's superiors, who go by the book. Like the screenplays for Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption, It's a Wonderful Life and All About Eve, the screenplay here has lines that are a) quotable and that b)linger long into the memory, just like the story the film tells.Whether it is the film's acting. Peter O'Toole is the easiest starting point, for he gives one of the best performances I have ever seen on film. His performance is so flamboyant and brilliant, it just highlights what a great actor he is. He nails Lawrence's complex character like a fitted glove, he is enigmatic and charismatic like TE Lawrence was like in real life. Supporting him all the way like iron are Alec Guiness, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins and Jose Ferrer. Their characters aren't as complex as Lawrence's but they are still fully fleshed out and intriguing.The film is very long, but thanks to the quality of the visuals, direction, screenplay, music and acting there is no time whatsoever wasted. Quite simply one of the best movies ever made, movie-making on the grandest scale. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Lawrence of Arabia
1,bkoganbing,A Complex Man In Epic Events,9,19 February 2007,"Although having just watched Lawrence Of Arabia again though I am bowled over by the size of the epic, I still can't believe that for the entire length of the film, the word oil was not mentioned. If it were done today it sure would be.T.E. Lawrence's story fascinates people today more than ever because he was in the center of the events that gave us the Middle East we have today. In the previous century and a half questions about that area revolved around the Ottoman Empire, the so-called sick man of Europe for that conglomerate of territory spilled into quite a bit of Europe. What's to happen if one country gets control of the place should that aging and decrepit empire falls apart. The question was postponed right up to World War I when Ottoman Turkey committed itself to the Central Powers. It was time then for the various peoples still under Ottoman control to rise and rise they did. In Arabia a young staff officer named T.E. Lawrence gained the trust and confidence of many Arab leaders and had a lot to do with uniting them and forming an army to chase fellow Moslems, the Turks out of the area and helping the British and French win in the Eastern theater of World War I. If going native which was the expression used by the British for one of their's who starts to identify with those he's supposed to subjugate than T.E. Lawrence went native in a big way. When his fellow countrymen did not keep pledges made to his Arabs he opted for a life of obscurity which is what he got until his death in 1935.David Lean when he couldn't get Marlon Brando for the part, opted instead for a young Irish player named Peter O'Toole who he had seen in the Walt Disney version of Kidnapped two years earlier in a small role. It was a felicitous choice as O'Toole became the star he remains to this day as a result of Lawrence of Arabia.It's a complex role and one you have to keep the audience interested in for over four hours. O'Toole runs the whole range of emotions here. We see him as idealistic, as arrogant, as humble, as honorable, as a stone killer, even a bit of a fathead at times. Sometimes a few of these mixed together at different points. Although David Lean got him a stellar supporting cast, if your Lawrence isn't any good, the film would flop. But Peter O'Toole was up to the challenge, he got the first of seven Oscar nominations. In this particular year he had some stiff competition with Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz, Jack Lemmon for The Days of Wine and Roses, Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian Style and the eventual winner Gregory Peck for To Kill a Mockingbird.Omar Sharif also making his first film for a world market got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Such Lean veterans as Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Anthony Quayle got plum roles. Anthony Quinn and Arthur Kennedy are the Americans in this film. Kennedy plays the fictitious Jackson Bentley who is really Lowell Thomas. Presumably Lowell Thomas did not want his name used here, but Thomas got his career started in the news field by reporting on T.E. Lawrence in this backwater theater of World War I, making his name famous and launching Thomas's own career in the process.One thing ever so gingerly hinted at was T.E. Lawrence's homosexuality. You can see it in his relationship with the two young men Daoud and Farraj played by John Dimech and Michel Roy. There is the alleged incident of gang rape when he's taken by Turkish soldiers led by their commander at Deraa, Jose Ferrer. It too is part of Lawrence's story though if Lawrence of Arabia were made today, they would be far more explicit.They would also be more explicit about oil instead of these unnamed 'British interests' that Lawrence is supposed to be really concerned with. You do get the idea that all they're interested in is the right of transit in the Suez Canal and the right to say who has the right of transit.Still Lawrence of Arabia is one sweeping epic both capturing the grandeur of the Arabian desert with the complexity of the issues and the man surrounding the desert campaign in World War I.",Lawrence of Arabia
2,Leofwine_draca,Wonderful cinematography and a worthy epic to boot,7,21 November 2014,"David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, a 4-hour desert epic telling the true story of T. E. Lawrence, a man who united the Arab tribes against their Turkish enemies, is considered an epic for a reason. It has wonderful vistas and backdrops brought to life by some splendid widescreen cinematography; it boasts a stirring score and stunning production values in which everything is catered for. It's the kind of film that makes modern movie-makers, with their green screens and CGI armies, look lazy.The story itself is both intriguing and compelling, working on both the individual and the expansive level. There's action here: desert crossings, battles, sabotage and war, and yet it's much more complex than that. The script carefully draws out the nuances of the various Arab tribes and the tribal complexities preventing peace in the region, as well as providing a fitting introduction to the modern-day Middle East.The only thing that really dates the movie is the acting, as these are the kind of stiff, mannered performances have long since gone out of fashion; Alec Guinness for example acts in a way long out of fashion. But the calibre of the cast is epic in itself and there are lots of supporting actors giving decent turns, such as Omar Sharif and Anthony Quayle. Peter O'Toole and his role both stay an enigma throughout, but that's no bad thing; instead, it only adds to the wonder of the piece.",Lawrence of Arabia
3,SnoopyStyle,One of the greatest movie of all times,10,20 February 2014,"T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) has a minor function in Cairo during WWI. Nobody really cares about the Bedouin uprising against the Turks except for Lawrence and the Arab Bureau. He's sent for 3 months since he would be of no great lost. He learns the ways of the desert, and memorably encounters Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) at a well. He finds Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) harassed by superior weapons, and the British unwilling to take Aqaba from the sea. So Lawrence proposes to take Aqaba from the desert and Feisal gives him 50 men.Director David Lean's vision is absolutely beautiful. The desert is beyond gorgeous. Peter O'Toole is brilliant. There is nothing inferior. It is all first rate. The bigger the screen, the better the movie looks. This is simply one of the best of all times.",Lawrence of Arabia
4,Hitchcoc,A Great Character! A lot of Camels!,10,22 January 2010,"I missed this film when it came out fifty years ago. I was just a kid. I've seen portions of it on TCM at times. I finally got a copy and saw it. It is is a wonderful story of one the most interesting figures in history. It is intelligent and exciting and frustrating. I began by accepting the verisimilitude of this film. I then watched the incredible effort put forth by Lawrence as he barged his British rear end into the affairs of the Arabs to meet and defeat the Turks. For me, the politics were the most interesting. The British Empire with its pack of windbags, bringing the world to its knees. We speak of the Nazis. What about the way the British treated the Bedouin populations in the name of imperialism. Still, as a snapshot of the strange landscape of social expansion, this movie is wonderful I found Lawrence's character utterly insufferable at times, his arrogance and insensitivity; but, by the same token, he was great to watch. I wish I'd had a chance to see this on the big screen. One issue I would take is that there is an awful lot of time following camels running across the desert. With a bit of cutting, I don't think much would have been lost.",Lawrence of Arabia
5,Prismark10,O'Toole Is Lawrence,10,21 December 2013,"I saw the restored version over 20 years ago but in a pan and scan version on television. I watched it again recently with the recent passing of Peter O'Toole, this time on widescreen and high definition.The film is known for its epic cinematography and vistas of the vast desert landscape. David Lean's film is the dictionary definition of the epic picture.When John Milius made the Wind and the Lion, he boasted 'look we are making our own epic film just like Lawrence of Arabia.' He then realised why it was so easy, Lean did it first and they were just following in his footsteps.Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese were involved in the restored version and have also acknowledged the film's influence on them.The screenplay of Lawrence of Arabia is the prototype that others have used as a template whether its drama, action or adventure.You do not just go to Aqaba, you take a detour to find a fallen Arab (Gasim) and head to Aqaba. Later when a blood feud is ignited and Lawrence decides things would be better if he was the one who killed the murderer. Who does the culprit turn out to be? Gasim, the man who he risked his own life to save.The film's opening scenes acknowledges Lawrence flawed character as we get differing opinions of him from the off. Peter O'Toole's Lawrence is perplexing, infuriating, cultured, enigmatic and pig headed.O'Toole sculptured a character that very much defined his film career. It seems unbelievable that he never won an Oscar for best actor for this film or for any other.There might be liberties taken with actual events. In reality Omar Sharif's character 'Sherif Ali' was a composite of several people and Anthony Quinn's Auda was more urbane, intellectual and cultured rather than the brute shown in the film.Maybe there are too many desert scenes in the film with sunrises and sunsets. There are hardly any female characters in the movie.You do get a vast epic and a literary screenplay that will stand the test of time. It is a deserved classic.",Lawrence of Arabia
6,kosmasp,Epic (role),8,13 April 2009,"With a stellar (male) cast, this movie can deservedly call itself an epic. The scope/cinematography (I saw the 70 mm version of the film), the storytelling, the grand music that is used and acting of course, elevate the whole experience.While I had my fair share of problems with film music before (see There will be Blood), I do like the composition and the use of it here. The acting could be called overly dramatic, but it fits very nice with the grand scope of the whole story(line). One of the most interesting facts and something people mostly don't realize: There's no speaking role for a woman in this movie. Not that it matters or makes the movie less effective, it's just a nice little piece of trivia. If you have the endurance to watch a long movie/drama, than there is no reason to miss on this one!",Lawrence of Arabia
7,classicsoncall,"""The man who gives victory in battle is prized over every other man.""",7,29 October 2006,"With it's epic sweep and stunning visuals, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has earned it's position among the greatest films of all time. That's a subjective fact I can live with, but at the risk of offending some of the more eloquent supporters on this site, there wasn't a lot that I could warm up to in this movie. More than once I wound up saying to myself 'I get it already' after repeated close ups of the baking desert sun and the limitless expanse of sand. Nor was I inspired to empathize with Lawrence's cause to unite the Bedouin tribes. One might contend that the story is far enough removed from modern history both chronologically and geographically to be of interest, but I would point to two films of the 1930's that took a similar tack and worked for me a whole lot better - 1935's ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" and 1939's ""Gunga Din"", both taking place on the Indian sub continent.Nor would I characterize the performances of the individual leads as less than significant. Peter O'Toole's portrayal of T.E. Lawrence is singularly noteworthy in capturing the essence of the man, while Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are all credible. Still, I had difficulty in relating to these characters, who seemed neither likable nor meaningful beyond their relationship to their tribes. What was essentially a defining moment in the story, the defeat of the Turks at Aqaba, seemed to be glossed over entirely as if the enemy simply rolled over and gave up.Perhaps the thing to do would be to give the film another chance, but at an investment of nearly four hours, I don't feel that's going to be a priority. I've considered the argument some have offered as to viewing the film on the big screen for it's maximum impact, but that opportunity doesn't seem likely. I'd like to keep an open mind about it, but for now, I'll have to remain a member of the minority on this film.",Lawrence of Arabia
8,gavin6942,Only One Word Describes This Film: Epic,8,9 April 2010,"Cairo during World War I: T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is a misfit British Army lieutenant, notable only for his insolence and knowledge of the Bedouin. Over the objections of a skeptical General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.This film asks: what makes England great: guns or discipline? And that's a question any nation or empire can ask. America today holds the power England once had, and what makes it great? Seemingly, the guns... military advantage does gain a country economic advantage. But a country can be great in other ways, such as its arts. Was England great in that way? Lawrence had a way of understanding the Middle East that few of his time -- or today -- really did. He made a map of the region and suggested on how to divide up the area. Tribes are given more credence, the Palestinians have their own land, as do the Armenians. Had England listened to Lawrence more, perhaps we would have fewer Middle Eastern disputes today. Perhaps...Historically, Lawrence was seen as asexual and a masochist. It's hard to show his asexuality, though we can say that the film does not portray him as a ladies man. Likewise, while we never see him being an outright masochist, the beating scene does suggest he is capable of taking great pain. To hint that he enjoyed it, though, may be going too far.This film is fantastic. It's a bit hard to get through in one sitting, coming just shy of four hours. But if you use the intermission for a bathroom break or to make a sandwich, it's well worth catching it all in a relatively short amount of time.",Lawrence of Arabia
9,lee_eisenberg,"I hate to challenge people, but...",10,3 March 2006,"OK, so everyone knows that T.E. Lawrence was a most impressive guy who was sent to colonize the Middle East and in the process began to identify with the people there. In the title role here, Peter O'Toole certainly does a really good job. The question is how accurate the movie is. Specifically, I mean the scene where Lawrence attacks the train and the Arabs cheer him on; I get the feeling that it didn't really happen like that, given that Lawrence was sent as a colonizer. And one has to wonder why Lawrence is always wearing white while everyone else wears black.Oh well. Other than all that, it's a pretty impressive film. One weird thing is that it has pretty much an all-male cast (actually, that's not surprising given that it's dealing with war). O'Toole, along with Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jose Ferrer, Claude Rains, and the rest all do a great job. I don't think that anyone can argue with ""Lawrence of Arabia""'s status as an epic.",Lawrence of Arabia
10,jboothmillard,Lawrence of Arabia,10,15 August 2006,"From Oscar and Golden Globe winning director Sir David Lean (Brief Encounter, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Doctor Zhivago), this is a magnificent classic that really set the standard for large on location filmed pictures. Basically it it is the true story of the finest British heroes who made his name in the First World War, Thomas Edward Lawrence (introducing BAFTA winning, and Oscar and twice Golden Globe nominated Peter O'Toole). The film starts with T.E. being killed in a motorbike accident, before going into flashback where he, a misfit British Army lieutenant, was stationed to Cairo, in the deserts of Arabia with orders from Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) and objections from General Murray (Donald Wolfit). He is sent to assess Prince Faisal (Sir Alec Guinness) and the plans to revolt against the Turks, after his Bedouin guide is killed by Sheriff Ali (twice Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Omar Sharif), he takes him to Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle) who introduces him to the Prince. Lawrence proposes with the Prince to make a surprise attack on Aqaba, which is only strongly fortified from one direction, and it is filled with many much needed supplies, and it is agreed that fifty men, plus teenage orphan servants Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), join him. Against odds they make it through the Nefud Desert, but Lawrence risking his own life goes back alone for fallen man Gasim (I.S. Johar), and returning to earn respect from originally sceptical Sheriff Ali. He also recruits powerful local Howeitat tribe leader Auda Abu Tayi (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Anthony Quinn) to go against the Turks, there is however a blood feud where a murderer needs to be found, who turns out to be Gasim, and his saviour shoots him, admitting later pleasure. Next we see Lawrence informing Dryden and the new commanding general General Lord Edmund Allenby (Jack Hawkins) in Cairo that they had victory overrunning the Turks, and we saw Daud die sinking into quicksand, and he is promoted to major. Next a guerrilla war is launched where trains are blown up and Turks are harassed, and he is made world famous when his exploits are published by American war correspondent Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). After shooting Farraj (Michel Ray) who is badly injured before he can be tortured after another raid Lawrence is taken with some Arabs by some Turks, before going to Jerusalem, and he is a changed tormented man. After returning he recruits an army full of money hungry killers and cutthroats rather than the Arab cause, and there is a point when he relishes in the results of a massacre. After taking Damascus, and some political debates and stuff, the end sees Lawrence promoted to colonel and immediately ordered home thought useful for both Faisal and the British diplomats, and he is driven away feeling dispirited. It may have been over three hours and twenty minutes long, but it is worth it, all the performances, especially from O'Toole, Sharif, Guinness and Quinn are fantastic, the story is admirable and enigmatic, the use of colour is impressive, but of course the real star is the magnificent grand scale landscapes, the golden sandy deserts with occasional mirages and blurry heat waves accompanied by the wonderful music by Maurice Jarre are essential viewing, one of the greatest British films ever made, a brilliant epic historical adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Maurice Jarre, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTAs for Best British Film, Best British Screenplay and Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Cinematography. T.E. Lawrence was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 3 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 40 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 9 on The 50 Greatest British Films, it was number 85 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 30 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",Lawrence of Arabia
11,ccthemovieman-1,"Memorable Visuals, Sound & Acting, Yet It Peters Out",8,17 June 2006,"I'm doing this review despite not having seen the movie in a number of years but what I remember best is some fantastic desert cinematography from the point when ""Lawrence"" (Peter O'Toole) arrives in the desert until about the last third of this 3-and-half-hour film. There are just numerous spectacular desert scenes and, of course, this was a must to be seen in widescreen. Fortunately, that has been available for many years, even on VHS. Between the direction of David Lean and the photography of Freddie Young, this is a fabulous visual treat, one to be treasured.Unfortunately, the story as well as the great visuals, seem to dissipate in the last hour-plus of the movie. It just kind of peters out, like Lawrence's desert campaign.The acting is superb with the possible exception of Anthony Quinn, who overacts. Two of the all-time greats - Alec Guiness and Omar Sharif - also added life to this monumental epic story. This was O'Toole's first role, too, and probably his most famous and some think his best. After this film and for a short period afterwords, O'Toole was looked upon as the premier actor in the business.For a film this long and with such little action, it's amazing it entertains as well as it does. For those who need some pretty women to aid in the story, forget it: in fact, there are NO women that I can remember. It gets by with the cinematography, O'Toole intense acting portraying a real-life vain, courageous, stubborn and obsessed Englishman trying to unite the Arabs to fight the Turks.Another very memorable and impressive aspect of this movie was the soundtrack. Is it my imagination or were soundtracks (like this one) more important and remembered better than movies in the last quarter of a decade? The main theme song is played throughout the film and I still remember it 44 years later.",Lawrence of Arabia
12,rmax304823,"Who, me? Neurotic?",10,29 December 2001,"When this film was released in 1962 I was seeing a shrink. Nothing serious, just the usual ontological Angst. You know, ""What's it all about?"" ""Why have I developed this sudden taste for houseflies?"" When I described my torment to him he tilted his head and asked, 'Have you seen Lawrence of Arabia'? Okay, this film has been analyzed to death, and with good reason. It's one of the best films ever made. David Lean has a way of doing things, and he's never done it better than here. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' may be more watchable, if you're not in a patient mood, but isn't -- couldn't be -- more thought provoking.Every role seems played to perfection. Peter O'Toole is a marvelous Lawrence, Homeric and naive. Anthony Quayle, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guiness, all do their best, which is more than good enough. Each is a jewel of a performance. I don't think I've ever watched a funnier scene than the change on politician Claude Raines' face when Hawkins, as General Allenby of the British Army, tells Lawrence that the British have no ambitions in Arabia. Lawrence accepts his word. Raines is sipping champagne and his eyes drift upwards and his mouth purses with amused disbelief -- how could anybody like Lawrence be so damned stupid? The editing is unimpeachable. Everyone applauds Stanley Kubrick for his cut in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", when the bone flung in the air becomes a space ship. It's like the moment at which the clucking chicken turns into a guitar in ""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" But there's a more quiet and equally effective cut here, when T. E. Lawrence in Cairo blows out a match and in the blink of an eye we are watching a crimson sun rise over a desert horizon so flat and blank it looks drawn with a ruler.If you want an isolated example of good writing and direction, watch the scene in which Lawrence and his men derail a passenger train and shoot it full of holes, killing everyone aboard. Lawrence shouts a cease fire, but his Arabs pay no attention and continue to riddle the cars. He runs out in front of them, shouting, but they still fire on the train. It takes two flares to get them to come to a ragged stop. That's the way real life generally is -- messy, chaotic, and with a jagged edge. Then compare this with a similar scene in ""Khartoum,"" made shortly afterwards. During a battle, every extra follows direction and obeys every order at once, running and riding from place to place like figures in a video game. I won't even bring up more recent ""epics"" like ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Titanic."" The most tragic moment doesn't involve death but Lawrence's disillusionment. When his plans for Arabian independence collapse, he's called in for a final conference with General Allenby. His expression is vacuous, far away, his voice distant and distracted. As he turns to leave, Prince Faisal says to him, 'Of course, what I OWE you' -- and there is a quick shot Lawrence turning to leave the room -- 'is beyond evaluation.' But the next shot, lasting a second, is only of Lawrence's back swiftly disappearing through the curtain. How easy it would have been for a director less thoughtful than Lean, less respectful of the audience, to have Lawrence stop in the doorway -- give us a close up here -- turn back to Faisal and clearly state some sort of fateful exit line: 'You're all hypocrites,' or ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" or something. Then leave, while trumpets of triumph blare. Instead Lawrence gets in a truck and leaves the dust and the camels and the Arabs, unimportantly, dismally, heart-breakingly, behind.",Lawrence of Arabia
13,ma-cortes,Expensive and breathtaking screen adaptation of enigmatic adventurer and military T. E. Lawrence,9,17 June 2015,"Mighty motion picture of action and adventure deals with Thomas Edward Lawrence , following this brilliant , flamboyant and controversial British military figure and his conflicted loyalties during wartime service . He was renowned for his liaison role during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, and the Arab Revolt against Ottoman Turkish rule of 1916–18 . This blockbuster is a huge accomplishment in every respect . It is a groundbreaking epic that is also literate and intelligent . Tremendous scenes , spectacular battles , intense drama , lots of action and awesome production design and art design from John Box and John Stoll . Still , the only way to really appreciate it turns out to be in Super Panavision and on big screen . Overlong though still knockout and resulting to be an immortal film . Based on T. E. Lawrence's book , ¨Seven pillars of wisdom¨ with interesting screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson . The breadth and variety of his activities and associations, and his ability to describe them vividly in writing, earned him international fame as Lawrence of Arabia . Peter O'Toole is splendid in his film debut , and made him an instant star . Colorful and impressive cinematography in Technicolor by Freddie Young . Unforgettable and classic musical score by the great Maurice Jarre . Lavishly produced by Sam Spiegel and masterfully directed by David Lean who bring us an overwhelming show delving deeply the complex personality of the British , semi-Arab leader who led the revolt against Turkey in WWI . Reissued in 1989 , a stunning version which restored a lot of cuts made over years . As many scenes of dialog were missing and as a result Peter O'Toole and a number of living principals returned and re-recorded dialog from more than 20 years previously . An ultimate thinking people's spectacle .Adding more biographic elements about this rich character T. E. Lawrence (16 August 1888 – 19 May 1935) , he was a British archaeologist, military officer, and diplomat . Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) was born out of wedlock . He became a practising archaeologist in the Middle East , working at various excavations and in 1914, before the outbreak of the Great War , Lawrence was commissioned by the British Army to undertake a military survey of the Negev Desert while doing archaeological research . Lawrence's public image resulted in part from the sensationalized reportage of the Arab revolt by an American journalist, Lowell Thomas (Arthur Kennedy) , as well as from Lawrence's autobiographical account . In 1917, Lawrence arranged a joint action with the Arab irregulars (Omar Sharif , I.S. Johar) and forces including Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) against the strategically located but lightly defended town of Aqaba. On 6 July, after a surprise overland attack, Aqaba (it was recreated in a dried river bed in southern Spain, consisting of over 300 buildings) fell to Lawrence and the Arab forces . After Aqaba, Lawrence was promoted to major, and the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, General Sir Edmund Allenby (Jack Hawkins) , agreed to his strategy for the revolt . In1918, Lawrence fought in the battle of Tafileh, an important region southeast of the Dead Sea, together with Arab regulars . The battle was a defensive engagement that turned into an offensive rout and was described in the official history of the war as a ""brilliant feat of arms"". Lawrence was involved in the build-up to the capture of Damascus in the final weeks of the war. Much to his disappointment, and contrary to instructions he had issued, he was not present at the city's formal surrender, having arrived several hours after the city had fallen. Lawrence entered Damascus around 9am on 1 October 1918 but was only the third arrival of the day; the first was the 10th Australian Light Horse Brigade, led by Major Harry Olden, who formally accepted the surrender of the city from acting Governor Emir Said . In newly liberated Damascus —which he had envisaged as the capital of an Arab state—Lawrence was instrumental in establishing a provisional Arab government under Faisal (Alec Guinness) . During the closing years of the war Lawrence sought, with mixed success, to convince his superiors , General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) , General Murray (Donald Wolfit), Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle) in the British government that Arab independence was in their interests . The secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between France and Britain contradicted the promises of independence he had made to the Arabs and frustrated his work . In 1935, Lawrence was fatally injured in a motorcycle accident in Dorset.",Lawrence of Arabia
14,moonspinner55,It doesn't bear the humanity of either character or filmmaker...,6,18 September 2005,"British Colonel, and ""shameless exhibitionist"", T.E. Lawrence, stationed in Cairo during the first World War, is sent by the military into the Arabian desert to locate a reclusive prince; living amongst the soldiers and bandits, he uses his flair for adventure to his advantage, leading an army in the war between the Arabs and the Turks. Sprawling, of course, but also imposing epic drama from director David Lean, with a nearly four-hour length that can be self-defeating. It's a film that should be seen on the big screen to get the full effect, although Lean's staggering grandeur tends to dwarf the plot, which is hardly a study of T.E. Lawrence and more a commercially-viable action picture. The performances are solid and intense, and there are many memorable sequences, but it's far more exhausting than moving. Visually it's always exciting, but we don't sense the broiling hot sun, or the winds whispering over the dunes. It's too much a tableaux. For a director like Lean to slaver over a project for so many years, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" should be a passionate document. But it doesn't ache, it doesn't bleed--it's a stunningly shaped rock, an unmovable one. **1/2 from ****",Lawrence of Arabia
15,Quinoa1984,"""...Nothing is written""",10,5 December 2006,"What a gigantic cinematic boom Lawrence of Arabia makes. It's an epic that's controlled by one of the most assured and basically visionary directors that the material could have asked for. And it leaves its final thirty minutes not with a totally triumphant hero, but one with more conflicts and despair than one might expect. Not that I would really expect a lot of Lawrence of Arabia on total fact, even as it is based on T.E. Lawrence's writings. Like with any other given number of biopics, we're given the 'character' of Lawrence, not the full-on man himself. And in Lean's ultra-masculine, heroic take on the man, it's got enough great scenes to knock others in other films out of the park.Why then did I feel as if I hadn't seen one of the very greatest films ever made? It's definitely not that i can't understand why some would say it so, as it contains that great need to tell a story that's worth telling (in the context it's presented), and with a cast of characters acted with the most finite of professionalism and passion. It's also the sort of picture, rarely made today it seems, that without a doubt is one of those meant to be seen on the big screen- practically all of the images captured by Lean and his crew out in that desert make a very convincing kind of metaphor for the picture, as man, no matter how much he ambitions or seeks out this or that or might think he is invincible for a little while, is quite small when seen in the 'grander scheme of things.' But like some other epic works I can think of, like Alexander Nevsky (albeit its short length I think of it in epic terms), or even more contemporary the Lord of the Rings, amid such a brave and undaunted work of superior craftsmanship there are some things that, subjectively, aren't totally in synch for me. One of those, chiefly, is Peter O'Toole's performance. It was his first big starring performance, and it's sort of mixed for me how I view him in this character. He ends up, by virtue of his own talents, being terrific in many scenes, like when he has to come to a fate with the same man he previously had saved en-route to Ackaba, or when he returns back to Cairo to tell of his ""impossible"" victory. Even the last half hour or so that I mentioned before is better than expected, as we see more of an opening up of the sort of mythical representation of the character of Lawrence. But for a lot of it I just didn't really see him as much as a conflicted and ambiguous legend as I did as a, well, light-voiced British guy. In some scenes I almost felt as if it was someone still coming to terms with playing such a larger-than-life guy, and with the same attitude and mannerisms of someone doing (not to put him down too much but) lesser-ring theater. He's actually kind of 'neat' for the role, and unfortunately in comparison with his counterparts he's not one of the most notable parts even as Lawrence himself is the main juice of the picture.Meanwhile, other actors get their time on screen wonderfully, with Shariff probably never (or rarely) better as Sheriff Ali, as he and Lawrence have the most fascinating connection of all. Quinn is quite good, if a little hammy (as to be expected) as the Tayi, the rival warrior who first wants gold and then goes along with what Lawrence might have in mind. It's always great to see Guiness with such control and nuance with a character who gets such limited time when compared with the other supporting players. They're all pit in a story that has a great energy in the first half, as Lawrence goes from shuttered in soldier to a near prophet for a whole mass of Arabs by crossing a desert deemed uncrossable, and storming a city thought to have been impossible to take. Then, as he continues military campaigning in part two however, things start to change, if maybe a little too fast one might think following his tense scene with Jose Ferrer's character.And all the while this is put to Lean, with his DP Freddie Young, in creating a larger-than-life atmosphere for a man who has highs and lows of how his perception goes, including to himself. A lot of times as Lawrence and/or his men went across the desert, or a character looked into the near abyss of sands, it was nearing being too picturesque, as if the style vied to overtake the substance. But Lean is always in service of the story, and the deliberate but wise screenplay. Not matter how grandiose Lean can get, he shoots with a sense of some conviction. One more note that makes Lawrence of Arabia quite worthwhile is the musical score, the kind that you rarely hear in big studio pictures with the exceptions of maybe John Williams or Howard Shore. Of all the Oscars given out to this film, the only one probably more deserved after Lean was for Jarre's compositions, which compliment the images and add just the right touches of emphasis.It's not un-probable that I could come back to Lawrence of Arabia some years from now and maybe even find it greater, even more towering an achievement of using insane lots of money to add flesh and bones to adapting history onto celluloid. For sure, if it ever does get re-released again, I probably would even check it out. That I might not put it so high in my favorite films though is also hard to deny: it is, like Lawrence, ""not perfect"". But it is still quite a ride getting through it all.",Lawrence of Arabia
16,edwagreen,Lawrence of Arabia-Call Him Larry **,4,28 May 2011,"I was terribly disappointed with this utter sand and dust desert film. That it won the Academy Award for best picture of 1962 is most shocking. The other 4 nominees had to be far better.As a historian, I knew they were referring to the World War 1 conflict. The name of the war is never mentioned throughout the film. The only way you knew that this wasn't World War 11 was that Turkey was Germany's ally. In the Second World War Turkey was neutral.The best performance here was given by Anthony Quinn. At least, we knew where he stood. Peter O'Toole looked half-crazed throughout and Omar Sharif was ready to study politics for nearly 4 hours of this epic joke of a film.

17,sunwarrior13,Epic Of All Epics,10,2 March 2012,"Lawrence of Arabia is a British film based on the life of T. E. Lawrence. It was directed by David Lean and produced by Sam Spiegel through his British company, Horizon Pictures, with the screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. The film stars Peter O'Toole in the title role. It is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential films in the history of cinema.The film depicts Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during World War I, in particular his attacks on Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his personal identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army and his newfound comrades within the Arabian desert tribes.This sweeping, highly literate historical epic covers the Allies' mid-eastern campaign during World War I as seen through the eyes of the enigmatic T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole, in the role that made him a star). After a prologue showing us Lawrence's ultimate fate, we flash back to Cairo in 1917. A bored general staffer, Lawrence talks his way into a transfer to Arabia. Once in the desert, he befriends Sheriff Ali Ben El Kharish and draws up plans to aid the Arabs in their rebellion against the Turks. No one is ever able to discern Lawrence's motives in this matter: Prince Feisal dismisses him as yet another ""desert-loving Englishman,"" and his British superiors assume that he's either arrogant or mad. Using a combination of diplomacy and bribery, Lawrence unites the rival Arab factions of Feisal and Auda Abu Tayi.After successfully completing his mission, Lawrence becomes an unwitting pawn of the Allies, as represented by Gen. Allenby (Jack Hawkins) and Dryden, who decide to keep using Lawrence to secure Arab cooperation against the Imperial Powers. While on a spying mission to Deraa, Lawrence is captured and tortured by a sadistic Turkish Bey. In the heat of the next battle, a wild-eyed Lawrence screams ""No prisoners!"" and fights more ruthlessly than ever.The epic of all epics, Lawrence of Arabia cements director David Lean's status in the filmmaking pantheon with nearly four hours of grand scope, brilliant performances, and beautiful cinematography. Two years in the making, the movie, lensed in Spain and Jordan, ended up costing a then- staggering $13 million and won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.",Lawrence of Arabia

19,Theo Robertson,"Epic , Epic , Epic And Epic",9,10 April 2015,"Since I've been watching an absolute ton of recent releases now is as good a time as any to take a step back and watch some old time undisputed epic cinema from the good old days . Nostalgia is never what it was but there was a time when the word ""Epic"" meant .well ""Epic"" . Nowadays epic merely means lots of CGI and anyone with a working knowledge of computer software could in effect create an epic film on their laptop . In ye days of olde if you wanted to create an epic scene then you'd have to go to the time and trouble of hiring extras and get round the logistical nightmare this involved . If it's set in an inhospitable location say a desert for example then the problem is magnified ten times . This masterpiece by David Lean is the type of movie I'm talking about and is .... Epic Lean is the sort of director Britain needs in the 21st Century . The most oft complaint of modern day British productions is of an uncinematic feel better suited to television , Not so with David Lean who perhaps conscious of the way television was eating in to prospective cinema audiences countered attacked by making his films bigger in scope and scale and more beautiful to look at . There is no replicating the genuine beauty of a film unless it's watched in the correct aspect ratio on a large screen . Lean uses the language of cinema as if it were his mother tongue , Editing , cinematography and musical score are perfect but then Lean was a perfectionist . If he was unsatisfied with a shot of the Sun rising he'd get the crew out the next morning just before dawn and if that shot wasn't good enough he'd do the same routine again until he'd captured perfection . I should also repeat for the benefit of those younger film fans blasé about film making over the last couple of decades that if you wanted a shot involving hundreds of men on horseback then the only way you could achieve it was by sticking hundreds of men on horseback Thomas Edward Lawrence was a homosexual but thankfully the film at the very most just fleetingly hints at this aspect to his character . If this type of bio-pic were made now I suspect that his homosexuality would be at the fore of the story but there's certainly no need to do that . What the film does is tell the story of a deeply complex man thrust in to a situation where killing is an everyday part of life , where enemies are allies one day due to pragmatic reasons but could easily be enemies again tomorrow , and of making promises you can't keep because powers above don't want to keep promises down to once again pragmatic reasons . It is a great performance by a young , unknown , impossibly handsome Peter O' TooleThere a few factual errors but since I recently stated changing the truth is justified to an extent if it makes a better film as in the case of THE IMITATION GAME I won't contradict myself here . I should point out though that Edmund Allenby had the greatest respect for the Arabs in their guerrilla war against the Ottoman Empire and is undoubtedly the greatest British general of the 20th Century . It's also slightly strange watching a film where the Arabs are if not the good guys then perpetual victims of the Turks and later British manipulation . In some ways the portrayal of the Turks doesn't go far enough since they were responsible for the first genocide of the 20th Century against the Armenians which was a direct inspiration for the Nazis twenty years later . Perhaps the most powerful scene of the film involves the suggestion of male rape by the Turks which is every bit as chilling as it is understated I've not done this film justice . All I have to say it made Scorsese and Spielberg want to become film makers and has been a massive influence on the modern day epic directors like Ridley Scott . Perhaps its only flaw is that it seems a little bit too old fashioned and the scenes are a bit too self congratulatory , but this is a minor flaw in a great film",Lawrence of Arabia
20,CinemaSerf,The finest ingredients for a film I've ever encountered...,9,8 December 2019,"This has got to be in my top ten movies - it is an almost flawless exercise in marrying fantastic photography, casting, writing, costumes and a score into three hours of wonderful entertainment. Rumour has it that Albert Finney was offered the lead role and suggested Peter O'Toole instead. If that is true (or not) then clearly serendipity was already on hand to guide this rendition of the story of TE Lawrence, who inspired and led an Arab uprising against the Ottoman empire. The iconic scene that introduces us to Omar Sharif as Lawrence heads to meet Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) starts us on a journey mixing adventure, politics, superstition, ambition and cruelty. Anthony Quinn is superb as are, in lesser capacities, Claude Rains, José Ferrer and Jack Hawkins as his somewhat cynical, but opportunistic GOC. Arthur Kennedy helps take Lawrence's story to the world and through his eyes we see how his character is changed by all the violence around/instigated by him. Peter O'Toole conveys the emotional rollercoaster of a journey from naive, optimistic officer to war-weary veteran in a dazzling fashion. This is a true treat of a film.",Lawrence of Arabia

Director David Lean captures well the adventures and achievements of Lawrence, as well as his personality, contradictions and inner conflicts.Superb cinematography - the desert vistas are a key positive of the movie.The running time - 3 1/2 hours - does make the movie a bit of an endurance test though. Not that it is ever dull, it is just the sheer amount of time you need to set aside to watch it. Usually I would say, for something like that, that a bit of editing is in order, but there is very little that can be edited out. Almost every scene is integral to the plot. Towards the end, however, there were one or two scenes that could possibly have been cut though.Great work from Peter O'Toole in the lead role, for which he received an Oscar nomination.

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Beautifully shot epic,10,30 December 2005,"I've heard plenty of things about this movie before I ever found out what it was about. The moment the music now famous as the piece that plays when we first see the desert came on, I recognized it from several movies and TV-shows. Though I didn't realize it until I saw him wearing them, I've seen Lawrence's Arabian clothes many times, several of these before I knew of the movie at all. I think that's what defines a true classic; that you know of it... before you're told. That it's ""everywhere"", in a sense. You can't really go anywhere without hearing about it at some point, because it was such an experience, it had such an impact on people. Everything that came later was in some way influenced by it, affected by it. The first thing that struck me about this film is how beautifully shot it is; at first, I couldn't quite muster up the effort to pay full attention, thinking about how long it would be(ADD victim = yours truly), but when I finally did, I couldn't take my eyes off it again. It was mesmerizing, captivating. I couldn't possibly express through mere words how amazing the visuals are... you have to see for yourself. Some say that the film is 'flashy', but every masterpiece has its critics. I'm certainly not one of this masterpiece's. The plot is well-written and develops nicely throughout the film. The pacing is very good, I was hardly bored at any point watching it(though it is quite a behemoth of a viewing experience... three hours and twenty minutes). The acting is top-notch, and Guinness, Sharif, Quinn and O'Toole are all magnificent. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography and editing are both state-of-the-art. Writing in general is excellent. The dialog is truly great, both as far as writing and delivery goes. This movie contains some highly memorable and impressive war scenes, as well, for anyone out there looking for that sort of thing. The film is a timeless classic that should be seen by just about anyone, regardless of their interest in fine film-making(which this is a prime example of) or historical accuracy(which this film seems to have more than its share of). I recommend this to anyone, but I suggest you make sure you have the patience for it. Put it on and watch it until the end. You won't regret it. I certainly didn't. 10/10",Lawrence of Arabia
24,neil-476,Superb,10,24 April 2020,"TE Lawrence is seconded to sound out Arab tribes under Turkish occupation. He oversteps his brief and forges relationships with both assorted prominent individuals and also the desert in which they live. He takes a prominent role in the uprising against the Ottomans, but at what personal cos?David Lean's 1962 3 hour plus desert epic won 7 Oscars including best film and best director. It deserved to. I won't list everything about it which merits mention, but here are some of the main ones.Peter O'Toole, at the start of his career, holds the screen effortlessly as Lawrence. By turn drive, haunted, trivial, it is a mesmerising portrait of a complex man. The rest of the cast is also excellent.The script, by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, never reverts to flamboyance, but instead delivers exposition with such economy that you are never aware of it. This is film writing at its best.Maurice Jarre's iconic there is merely the icing on the cake that is the score.And the look of the film! Putting to one side - as if the can! - the sheer scale of the film, the logistics of getting film crew, cast and extras to locations where those extraordinary vistas could be captured, you are then almost forced to notice the beauty of the jil.

25,evanston_dad,Majesty in the Desert,10,29 April 2005,"The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out. Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon. It's one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" And it's only the first of countless memorable moments in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them. Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has these elements too, but at heart it's a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.""Lawrence"" feels unlike other historical epics of its time. In most ""big"" films--I'm thinking of movies like ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Cleopatra,"" all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as ""Lawrence""--one gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses. One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot, and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction. Everything feels static and wooden. But in ""Lawrence,"" Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme close-ups of actor faces. In one especially brutal scene, after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people, the action cuts to a close-up of O'Toole, looking panicked and crazed, gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he's reluctant to drop it, obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It's moments like that---not just an impressive battle scene but a character's reactions to the results of that scene---that set ""Lawrence"" apart from other standard epics.And of course, I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O'Toole. He is perhaps my favorite actor, not one of the most prolific, but certainly one of the most unpredictable. He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform. He carries ""Lawrence of Arabia"" almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders. That's not to say the supporting cast isn't great, but O'Toole towers above them all. O'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be, and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization, leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshiped or feared, or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" again. His later films are certainly more than watchable, and ""A Passage to India"" is even quite remarkable in its own way, but we would never get another ""Lawrence."" Even more reason to appreciate it now.My Grade: A+",Lawrence of Arabia
26,AlsExGal,A sweeping epic with many layers of complexity,10,21 November 2009,"It's hard for the small screen to do justice to such a sweeping cinematographic epic, but there is much more to this film than its visual majesty. The film has one of the most beautiful and recognized scores in the history of cinema, a fascinating subject in the person of T.E. Lawrence himself, one of the most literate screenplays ever written, and a wonderful supporting cast nearing perfection. It is a shame that unless you take the time to buy the DVD and invest the almost four hours it takes to watch it, you are likely to miss out on one of the best films ever made. It is precisely because of its length that it is seldom seen on TV anymore. The backdrop of the film is that the British, in the midst of fighting World War I, are aiding the Arab struggle for independence from the Turks since anything that ties up the Turks accomplishes the British goal of destroying the Ottoman Empire and thus aids in the war effort. T. E. Lawrence is first enlisted to help advise the Arabs in their military goals, but goes on to lead them in a series of stunning military victories that goes way beyond what the British expected of the Arabs, and quite frankly, way beyond what the British wanted. You see, the British had designs on claiming Arabia for themselves after the war ends, years before it was discovered that Arabia was sitting on the world's richest oil supply.However, this is really an oversimplification of a very complex film. This movie is so multi-faceted that you could tackle reviewing it from several angles. To me one of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the complex relationship and contrast between Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif), fellow tribesman and counsel to Prince Feisal, and T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole). When the two first meet Ali shoots down Lawrence's Arab companion who is taking him to first meet Feisel because the man is drinking from Ali's well and does not have permission to do so. An outraged Lawrence chastises Ali citing that Arabia will never be great as long as they war amongst themselves and that he is ""barborous and cruel"". Towards the end of the film, though, there is a reversal of roles as Ali tries to stop a massacre that Lawrence is not only allowing his troops to participate in, but seems to be genuinely enjoying. Ali is a man who has a good bead on who he is and what he believes. Not having this quality is Lawrence's greatest shortcoming. Lawrence either believes he is much less than he is or much more, depending on his latest exploits and who has talked to him last. Ali clearly sees this problem, and by the end of the film Ali is Lawrence's fast friend - in fact his only true friend. You see, Lawrence is being used by both the Arabs and the British. This becomes immensely clear when at the end of the film Prince Feisel, who has always seemed to be genuine towards Lawrence, says during negotiations with the British ""Lawrence is a double-edged sword - We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?"". By the way, the role of Ali has to be Sharif's finest hour as an actor. I always thought Dr. Zhivago was that finest role, and it is still a great performance, but this one is even better.There are so many other themes going on in this film - the thin line between madness and heroism, the worth of a single human life versus the welfare of an entire army or a nation, the sometimes less than honorable motives behind those fighting for the honorable goal independence, the contrast between western and Arab values - that you could go on forever. That is why I strongly recommend this film. You'll probably come away with something a little different on each viewing.",Lawrence of Arabia
27,ferguson-6,We can't all be lion tamers,10,27 March 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been over 50 years since the film's initial release and more than 20 since I last viewed it on the big screen. When Cinemark announced it as part of the Classic Film Series, I circled the date on my calendar. While most movies are best viewed in a theatre setting, no other film absolutely demands such a setting.There are many elements that contribute to the well deserved ""classic"" label: David Lean's direction, Freddie Young's photography, the star-studded support cast, the historical significance, Maurice Jarre's iconic score, and of course, Peter O'Toole's standout and unusual performance. This is an action-adventure film with up close battle scenes filmed with no CGI aid. The famous shot of Omar Sharif's Sheriff Ali slowly making his initial appearance on the desert horizon is breathtaking on a 60 foot screen. Watching Lawrence's victory dance on top of the train is majestic in the theatre, and the big screen provides the necessary ominous feeling as the Arabs slowly navigate the blowing sands of the Nefud Desert.T.E. Lawrence was a fascinating man, though there has been much debate about the film and his legend. Lawrence's own writings in ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" provided many details used by screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, as well as the writings of American photo-journalist Lowell Thomas ... depicted in the film as Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). The real life Thomas was looking for a hero and likely sensationalized his story of Lawrence, but most believe the foundation is fairly accurate.While the story of T.E. Lawrence is incredibly interesting, the story in the film is somehow just part of the experience. Director David Lean's movie is a true experience for movie lovers. This was Mr. Lean's middle film of an incredible streak of three ... The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Doctor Zhivago (1965) being the others. Lean insisted on filming on location, rather than in studio despite the nearly four hour run time. This decision drove the cost up, but allowed for the stunning visuals that set it apart.In addition to O'Toole's performance, it is quite exciting to see the dynamic Omar Sharif, the powerful Anthony Quinn (as Auda abu Tayi), the classy Alec Guiness (as Prince Faisal), the kinda creepy Jose Ferrer, the familiar Jack Hawkins and the slightly slimy Claude Rains. Missing from this list is any actress. The movie features exactly zero speaking roles for women.Maybe the only two actors of the era who could have competed with this fabulous landscape were Peter O'Toole and Marlon Brando. Brando was actually first cast as Lawrence, but soon dropped out to star in Mutiny on the Bounty. O'Toole's blue eyes and white robe created quite the contrast to the sandy desert. Speaking of contrast, the two times he admires his reflection in his knife are visual keys to his evolution from God complex to broken man. After attending the premiere, writer Noel Coward told O'Toole, ""If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia."" The movie received 10 Oscar nominations. It walked away with 7 wins including Best Picture, Director, Cinematogapher, and Score. O'Toole lost out to Gregory Peck (To Kill a Mockingbird). Mr. O'Toole has received 8 Best Actor nominations without ever winning. Watching this film (more than once) is a must for any movie lover. The opportunities to view it in a theatre setting are quite rare, so please seize the chance should it present itself. Your four hour commitment will be rewarded with a movie memory you'll never lose.",Lawrence of Arabia

Lawrence treks across a massive desert in the midst of a war between the Arabs and the Turks. He meets with Prince Faisal who leads this revolt against the Turks. The film depicts how these events at first come as a humorous challenge, to gaining respect for saving a life of someone who falls behind, to performing an execution, to being flogged. Director David Lean previously scored success with The Bridge on the River Kwai and now he creates another broad scale film of desert landscapes and riveting war violence where Lawrence leads in the blowing up railroads. Peter O'Toole delivers a masterful performance as Lawrence who experiences the exhilaration of violence to the extremes of human decay. Alec Guinness plays Faisal who looks on at Lawrence with curiosity. Omar Sharif steals scenes as Sheriff Ali who first shoots Lawrence's companion for unauthorized drinking from an Arab well, then they become close companions. Anthony Quinn is also featured as a tribal leader persuaded to join in the revolt. Jack Hawkins is cast as General Allenby. This is a powerful film about the exploits of violence and its wages upon the human soul. Score: 10 / 10",Lawrence of Arabia
29,HotToastyRag,Peter O'Toole should have won an Oscar,7,22 May 2018,"With only a few television credits and bit parts in Hollywood, Peter O'Toole made his breakthrough performance in Lawrence of Arabia. Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies that everyone remembers a scene from even if they haven't seen the four-hour epic all the way through. Between the famous theme from Maurice Jarre, the iconic rooftop silhouette, ""No prisoners!"", the appetizing order of lemonade, Omar Sharif's entrance, Peter O'Toole's beautiful blue eyes sparkling in the middle of the desert, and the hundreds of fight scenes, there are plenty of memorable moments to choose from when you relive the movie as you talk about it with your friends.In case you don't know, David Lean's sprawling, dazzling epic is about T.E. Lawrence's time fighting in the Arabian Peninsula. This is much more than just another WWI movie. Peter O'Toole is not a gung-ho commanding officer who joyfully leads his men into battle. He's incredibly conflicted and disgusted by war. To him, a dead soldier is not a statistic, it's a man. During the famous ""No prisoners!"" scene, in which he only utters those two words, his face shows an incredible array of emotions. If you watch that scene and don't simultaneously think he was robbed of his Oscar and fall in love with him, well, watch it again. Guys, feel free to develop a man-crush; no one will blame you. After all, Noel Coward famously quoted, ""If *he* had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia.""Unfortunately for Peter O'Toole, this incredible epic was released during the same year as To Kill a Mockingbird, and no one else stood a chance come Oscar time. He was in pretty good company, though, since Burt Lancaster and Jack Lemmon also lost out that year after giving excellent performances in Birdman of Alcatraz and Days of Wine and Roses, respectively. The good news is Lawrence of Arabia did win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography, among others. This a great compromise movie for date night, if you don't mind a four-hour running time. Ladies will get to drool over the ridiculously handsome Peter O'Toole-as Robin Williams said in Aladdin, ""Pick a feature!""-and gents will get lost in the endless fighting and strategy scenes with nary a woman in sight. This is definitely a man's movie, and if it weren't for the perfect piece of eye candy, no woman in her right mind would probably watch it. If you're considering renting it, check out the preview. Usually, old movies were chopped into terrible previews, but this one is pretty good. It gives a pretty good representation of the film and shows off the supporting cast, including Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quayle, and Claude Rains.",Lawrence of Arabia
30,AaronCapenBanner,Sweeping Desert Drama.,8,9 November 2013,"David Lean directed this sweeping,(and Academy Award winning best picture and director) historical account of the life of T.E. Lawrence(played unforgettably by Peter O'Toole) who is a young intelligence officer in Cairo during WWI sent to investigate the Arab revolt against the Turks. Amazingly, he does more than that, as he somehow manages to lead them himself in their guerrilla attacks against the Turks! For two years he succeeds, but then is called upon to lead this army against the Ottoman Empire. Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn, & Anthony Quayle costar. Superbly directed and acted film is certainly long, and Lawrence does remain an enigma throughout, but the skill of the exquisite visuals and sumptuous score make up for it.",Lawrence of Arabia
31,Wuchakk,"Freedom from the shackles of ""civilization""",9,8 June 2014,"David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia may be well over 50 years old now, but it stands the test of time like all truly great works.The movie details T.E. Lawrence's experiences as a British liaison who inspires the Arab revolt against Turkish rule during World War 1 (1916-1918).At 3 hours and 47 minutes this is a LONG movie but somehow strangely hypnotic. The awesome music plays a huge part in this effect.If you're weary of the moronic approach of too many modern films (too much CGI and roll-your-eyes action, etc.) Lawrence of Arabia is the perfect antidote.It's mainly the story of a European man who sheds his stuffy ""civilized"" upbringing to revel in a new-found freedom in the desert wilderness as he integrates with the Arabs and basks in their glowing acceptance. He accomplishes this by, first, disregarding his superior's orders and honestly relating to the Arabs and, second, by proving himself unbiased to any specific tribe and willing to risk everything in helping them to defeat the Turks.Those spoiled by modern blockbusters won't likely appreciate ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but those who have an eye for artistic cinema will revel in it.GRADE: A",Lawrence of Arabia

Its a real life story from a book, and I find real life more interesting then fiction.  We do not no if Lawrence went mad, or was brilliant.  The story is entertaining, and the film ages well.

34,lasttimeisaw,Lawrence of Arabia,9,24 July 2012,"A first-time viewing of this David Lean's internationally renowned masterpiece in a KVIFF grand-screening this year, which is an unforgettable 222 minutes of revelry for a film aficionado. Technically speaking, this epic film is flawless, who would not be appalled and intoxicated by the picturesque shots of the desert, and amazed by the strenuous effort from the monolith teamwork to produce such a magnificent celluloid-biography.Peter O'Toole has set such insurmountable brio for his fame-entry performance as T.E. Lawrence, a contentious figure as the messiah of the Arabic country, therefore, a condescending stance also cannot be sidestepped whenever dealing with this race-sensitive issues, an ad hoc situation for this film, a British hero among Arabian peoples is more or less difficult to pander to both parts, besides the sizable veneration towards the original book, Lean has an artistic etiquette to take advantage of phenomenal visual thrusts to proffer a universally soul-stirring magnetism, to which everyone could be warmed regardless of age, cultural background and race. The matinée idol-studded supporting group also emits indestructible prowess to cement the compelling story, my only dissent is Alec Guinness should have topped Omar Sharif (who was co-nominated with O'Toole in the Oscar race) for the honor, although Omar's rendition is a very satisfying one. Quinn, Hawkins, Quayle, Rains and Kennedy, such a sumptuous lineup, even José Ferrer's Turkish warlord cameo is inexplicable charming and deadly dangerous. The gay undertones are flowing in a minute and downbeat passage but one could sense the utterly woman-free idiosyncrasy might insinuate much more than just being set against a military and Arabic milieu. If one must pick the underbelly, in my opinion the action sequences might not be Lean's strongest suit, e.g. the war battle slaughter is quite merciful and riotous in an artificial angle, albeit there were authentic and elephantine menfolks being deployed, but in an era without the now-overabundant CGI technology, this 7 Oscar-winning film (including BEST PICTURE and BEST DIRECTOR) is not only the hallmark of Lean's career, but the entire golden Hollywood as well.",Lawrence of Arabia
35,sddavis63,Quite A Spectacle,8,2 August 2010,"This is no doubt a magnificently filmed spectacle (that word seems to suit it better than the more mundane ""movie"" or ""film"") about one of the more enigmatic characters of the 20th century - the British officer T.E. Lawrence - and his involvement in the Arab nationalist movement during World War I (and after - although the post-War material wasn't included.) The desert scenes are stark and beautiful (as you would expect a desert to be) but also portray the dangers of the desert (again as you would expect.) The portrayal of the Arabs is for the most part accurate (a bickering group of loosely allied tribes rather than any sort of unified nation) and the performances were generally very good. Peter O'Toole (in his earliest role of significance) was brilliant in his portrayal of Lawrence (effectively portraying divided loyalties and a sort of messianic - perhaps somewhat mentally unbalanced - sense of his own destiny.) Alec Guinness was surprisingly effective as Prince Feisal - the closest there was to an accepted leader of the Arabs. There are some excellent desert battle scenes (especially where the Arabs under Lawrence take out an Ottoman train and the attack on Damascus.)The biggest problem with the movie is its history. The movie glorifies Lawrence (or at least his role) too much. He wasn't quite as central to the movement for Arab independence (or to the Arab revolt against Ottoman rule) as portrayed, for example. At close to four hours, there's also no doubt that all but the most dedicated will suffer a few yawns here and there (and I confess that I watched this in two parts.) Still, this deserves credit for its very ambition and for its high quality (some suspect history notwithstanding.)",Lawrence of Arabia
36,Robert_duder,I know it's a classic and it's easy to see why but here's why it isn't perfect,8,5 February 2007,"I finally decided to watch the classic Lawrence of Arabia in my attempt to catch up on film classics I have never seen. Now I don't for one minute intend on talking down about this film. It is easy to see why Lawrence of Arabia stands the test of time as a classic. The absolutely stunning breathtaking cinematography, the incredible 'would be' special effects that probably had to be done with man power and the thousands and thousands of extras used in stunning battle scenes and traveling across the desert. You can't get more spectacular than the scenery in this film. Hands down a huge 10/10 for what they did with the cast and scenery. The story is simple enough and based on a true story of World War II British soldier who finds himself conflicted on who he is truly fighting for when he becomes entangled with the Bedouin armies of Arabia. I also realize that this is an epic and that being said and being filmed in the sixties, historical epics were known to be lavish productions. I watched this film on a 2 disk DVD and at the end of the first DVD I was so pleased, I almost wanted to watch it again and again and slap a perfect score on it. I would have been just as happy to have it end right there. But as it turned out there was another disk with an hour and a half on it adding the total running time to an outstanding 3 1/2 hours and I have nothing against that unless it's not necessary. I found the last part of this film very unnecessary, it dragged, it bogged down the story and I found it quite confusing. Yes I understand that it brought about T.E. Lawrence's conflicted opinions about the war but it just almost felt like an anti-climax and sadly brought the film down for me.Veteran actor in his screen debut Peter O'Toole plays Lawrence. I think O'Toole perfectly captures everything Lawrence was meant to stand for. O'Toole as Lawrence is conceited, young, naive, bull headed, and has great delusions of grandeur which he uses to win over the Arabians. On top of these less than desirable traits Lawrence has incredible charisma and leadership qualities and O'Toole is the same way. At first he seems almost smug and monotone but the more you watch him the more he electrifies the screen and you become enamored with him. I don't know if that's talent of a gift but either way he makes the film what it is. The incredible Sir Alec Guinness plays Prince Feisal, the leader of one faction of the Arabian army who leaves his men to the trust of Lawrence after becoming enamored with him. It's not a big role but when Guinness is on screen he makes it larger than life. Anthony Quinn is the opposite leader Auda abu Tayi whom Lawrence brings together with Feisal's men to take Damascus away from the Turkish army. Quinn is much like Guinness who doesn't need a lot of screen time to make an impression. They are both worthy of royalty. And Omar Sharif is brilliant and intelligent as Sheriff Ali who becomes Lawrence's wing man and friend.The cast are all brilliant together, the story is of epic proportions and the direction which was Academy Award winning by David Lean is nothing short of brilliance. It might possibly be one of the best directed films I have ever seen. It's simply breath taking. But so much extra is added that I'm just not sure it was necessary. Lawrence becomes so conflicted and ends up leaving them and it just seems to contradict everything he had done. Perhaps I am just being petty about it and I didn't like the ending but nonetheless the last hour and a half was too much for me. Still I don't regret for a minute seeing it and I encourage everyone to see this because even now it's spectacular to watch, imagine how it felt more than 40 years ago. 8.5/10",Lawrence of Arabia
37,ElMaruecan82,Miraculous,10,28 March 2012,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a classic among the classics, unanimously praised for its dazzling imagery, haunting music and the hypnotic performance of Peter O'Toole. And how David Lean got the guts to shoot a 4-hour long epic film in the desert, with no female role, no romance whatsoever, with more meditation than sheer action, to create one of the most glorious cinematic experiences is a miracle like only the magic of film-making can provide every once in a while, like ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""The Godfather"".As said Roger Ebert in his most interesting review, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a masterstroke of genius in the way it went against all the movies' conventions for the sake of pure creation. To make his film, Lean had probably to visualize how photogenic would the immensity of the desert be, how a sunset in a red sky would amaze eyes, how the iconic entrance of Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali would challenge every viewer. And Ebert couldn't have been more accurate because while watching ""Lawrence of Arabia"", I couldn't stop imagining the magical effect of these shots in the darkness of a movie theater, seeing this vague little strain in the middle of a mist turning into a thin silhouette until the figure of the black-clad Sheriff Ali emerges on the screen: pure magic Lean trusted both his minds and our eyes. See it's impossible to dissociate ""Lawrence of Arabia"" from the sensational experience each frame conveys. And Lean, who had just directed another acclaimed Best Picture winner, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", handles his material with much more confidence if it was ever needed. Think of the overture in the dark. Imagine yourself sitting in a movie theater and hearing the heart-pounding drums of Maurice Jarre before the violins let escape one of the most iconic movie themes. Imagine your ears transported by this melody, visualizing in the dark, a majestic and frightening sun, an endless desert, a mysterious Oriental Goddess that scares as much as fascinates  after such a set-up, the rest is history and I don't think I would bring anything new to the debate. This is why I want to develop the aspect that can easily get unnoticed in such a grandiose epic: the script.In ""Lawrence of Arabia"", the lines flow with the poetry of a Greek tale with some shadowy truths resonating when you put them in historical perspective. T.E. Lawrence was the man who guided the Arab Revolt against the Turkish colonization during World War I. In a way, he embodies this quote from the New Testament: ""No prophet is accepted in his own country"", he's not a prophet of course in the literal meaning of the word, but he ignited an extinguished flame, the flame of a pride, distancing himself from the decadence of the British Empire to embrace a romantic cause, romantic because lost. It's not an Englishman leading the Arabs; it's an outcast leading an outcast people. And pay attention, there is this incredible mix of madness and inspiring masochism in the eyes of this man who plays with fire without even minding the pain.O'Toole's eyes are pure and his face like graved in a vivid marble, as if he incarnated heroism in its most classical personification, he speaks the truth and acts according to it. In his first encounter with Sheriff Ali, he delivers an unforgettable and powerful rant: ""So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe... so long will they be a little people, a silly people. Greedy, barbarous and cruel, as you are."" These lines still resonate as true and it seems like the Arabs didn't learn from History, earning them one of the worst reputations in all the Western World (not everything is to be blamed on Arabs though, but that's not the point). You can tell in O'Toole's voice that he's sincere and this sincerity is displayed in the next crucial scene when he overtakes his roles and encourages Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) to fight. The scene features another powerful saying: ""Great things have small beginnings"". This very line echoes another of the film's many extraordinary moments.After having miraculously survived the crossing of the implacable Nefud desert, Lawrence rides his camel back to find a man lost in the Desert and he succeeds off-screen, leading to one of the greatest moments in the film when one of Lawrence's two servants rides his camel toward him, screaming under the triumphant core of Maurice Jarre. This exploits earns him the respect of the Arabs, a people that value bravery. Lawrence becomes 'Awrence, one of them, finally wearing his iconic white suit. His act showed how even the greatest conquest start with an act of brotherly love and solidarity, and the Arabs couldn't defeat the Turks, before defeating their own selfishness and dividing tribalism. The romanticism of the fight scenes and their exhilarating effect on Lawrence who dances his victory on a Turkish train and enjoys the madness of the war contrasts with the pessimism of the end, where the old politicians replace the young warriors.Men like Lawrence would only incarnate dreams, lost in the lies of political calculations, greed, profit and power, condemning the Arabs to fantasize over and over again on Cordoba and its ""two miles of lighting in the streets, when London was a village"". It didn't last as much as Cordoba but Lawrence of Arabia represents a beautifully romantic parenthesis in Arab history that makes the rest of the Century extremely depressing. But given the events of the Arab Spring, the Arabs are conquering their pride back like the Spanish did for Cordoba, there is still a light of hope after all.At least, one of the most revered films in America and most defining of American Cinema would be about the Arabian pride how delightfully ironic!",Lawrence of Arabia
38,gbill-74877,Magnificent,9,10 December 2019,"Absolutely magnificent. There are so many awe-inspiring shots in this film, from the grand sweeping desert vistas, to the horseman emerging out of a mirage in that glorious long shot, to the three figures in the distance with a huge sun rising on the horizon, to Lawrence on his camel at the Red Sea after the Battle of Aqaba ... it just seems like I could go on and on. Also beautiful are the little shots that are so poetic, such as that moment when we see Lawrence's shadow as he leaps nimbly atop a Turkish train he's just derailed. The scope and grandeur of what director David Lean and cinematographer Freddie Young accomplished here can't be overstated.There are historical inaccuracies but it seems to me that the gist is reasonably correct, and I liked how the flaws of British politics, British racism, and Lawrence's personal issues which led up to the Tafas massacre were all exposed ... even as we are blown away by some aspects of his character (and certainly by his bravery, and his desire for Arab independence and self-rule). The fact that to take Aqaba from its unguarded side he really did go through 600 miles of desert by camel over a two month period with only 45 rebels, each carrying only water and a 45 pound sack of flour at the outset, is mind-boggling to say the least.Peter O'Toole leads an extraordinary cast, and perfectly looks the part (who cares about the height difference to the real Lawrence?). Robert Graves wrote that T.E. Lawrence's eyes ""immediately held me ... they were startlingly blue, even by artificial light"" - and that's certainly true of O'Toole. More importantly, he delivers an inspired, nuanced, and ambiguous performance, one that's as elusive and tortured as the desert sand being whipped up into spirals by the wind. Alec Guinness is similarly striking as Faisal, future king of Greater Syria and then Iraq. As he stares into the prospect of the British and French divided up the Middle East for its oil per the Sykes-Picot Agreement, he says so wisely:""There's nothing further here for a warrior. We drive bargains. Old men's work. Young men make wars, and the virtues of war are the virtues of young men. Courage and hope for the future. Then old men make the peace. And the vices of peace are the vices of old men. Mistrust and caution. It must be so.""Great film, and truly worthy of being dubbed epic.",Lawrence of Arabia
39,g-bodyl,"Epic On A Grand Scale, But.......",9,17 March 2014,"This is not the greatest movie ever made. Don't get me wrong, this is still the father of all epics and it won't get any grander than this, but I felt like something was missing. Maybe it's the length or excess of plot material, but Lawrence of Arabia misses being perfect, but not by too much. At nearly four hours in length, the film is beautifully shot and loved the perfect, CGI-less desert sun. It's well-acted with stand-out performances by everyone involved and David Lean expertly directs an epic a lesser man could not get right.Lean's film is a biographical look at the adventurous T.E Lawrence who is known for his famous exploits in the Arab world. During World War One, British officer Lawrence is sent to the Arab world to unite the warring tribes against the Turkish empire.This film features perhaps the greatest acting achievements in film history. Peter O'Toole is just magnificent as Lawrence and this is the role that sent him down the road of stardom. Omar Sharif, no stranger to David Lean, is nearly as good as Lawrence's Arab buddy. Alec Guinness also delivers a strong performance as Prince Feisal.Overall, this is certainly the father of all epics. It has everything you want to see, especially in these older movies. A sweeping cinematography, a beautiful score, masterful acting, superb directing and great editing. However, this is not the greatest film in the world. It's overlong and sometimes a bit stuffy. But it's close and that I can definitely see. A film that shall not be forgotten for the ages. I rate this film 8.5/10",Lawrence of Arabia
40,secondtake,"Stunning in so many ways, grand and intimate and surprising!",8,4 March 2013,"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)Funny, but this epic masterpiece starts with a bit of clumsy direction, an almost (almost) corny motorcycle crash. And then the movie begins in more earnest with the rise and triumph of the title character. The production values seem to never flag from the moment we arrive in Africa (shot in Morocco and Jordan, mostly), with embracing scenery, huge casts of extras (and horses), unusual levels of excitement that seem historically about right, and some intensely wonderful acting.This is a gutsy, highly polished British movie from the end of the great Golden Age of this kind of great dramatic style. The story is fascinating and grand, and the scenery is absolutely one of the central points throughout. You get sucked in and swept away with all the huge wide and often silent desert landscapes. And most of all, the story is astounding. It's about a man who is exceptional--a real man, not Bruce Willis in some office tower.Peter O'Toole is at his best here. David Lean, the director, seemed to know how to keep him both rebellious and restrained. (If you see a later film, like ""The Ruling Class,"" you'll see a typical overcooked performance from O'Toole, equally remarkable I suppose but less finessed.) This portrayal of the daring British military officer in the Arabian desert is not meant to be perfectly factual (there are lots of battles about the facts, online and even in the opening scenes of the movie), it's meant to be moving and historically significant, and historically close enough.And it's personally impressive. This is a story that takes place on two main levels. One is the man's new understanding of the politics of the mideast in the 1910s and 20s. The other is the man himself, this wild and cunning and sometimes fearless and sometimes almost insane man who is able to adapt to Arab life and enter its problems from within and yet still remain thoroughly British in his attitudes. It's quite something to see, and O'Toole makes it believable more than you'd expect. If you met the real Lawrence of Arabia you might object that he's not playing his part quite right.The movie also has lasting importance as the Arab world (or the Middle East as it is still called) goes through more political change. It makes what Lawrence accomplished all the more profound. You might say that if he hadn't done it someone else would have, that the rise of Arab power we inevitable. Maybe. But that's not what happened, and this is. In a way, the whole movie is about Lawrence trying to unify the Arabs. His goal at first is to defeat the Turks who are occupying Arabia, but it eventually becomes more personal. He identifies with the plight of the Arabs but never quite becomes one.There are things that bring this down to earth a little, especially the playing with clichés (the photographer is good but sort of patched on, and some of the Arab characters are thinly sketched). But there is a host of wonderful actors, the one true Middle Easterner being Omar Sharif (he's Egyptian by birth, and he's quite good here). The other main ones are such good actors you don't quite remember they are English to the core--Alec Guinness and Claude Rains (quite old here, but still wonderful). Anthony Quinn (originally Mexican) is really good though his fake nose needed some better color--a weird thing for them to mess up on in a hugely complicated movie like this.Most of all it's O'Toole and more O'Toole, appropriately. A penetrating, original, almost possessed performance within a gorgeous, long but not too long film.",Lawrence of Arabia

The plot, what little there is of it, is generally uninteresting and rambling, causing the middle part of the film to drag terribly.

44,The-Sarkologist,An English Teacher's Dream,9,29 June 2013,"My friend says of this movie: it is an English teachers dream. It is a movie of stunning lines and real characters. It is a movie of many themes all tied together and one that has gone down in history as a classic. It is a movie that needs to be watched over again to fully understand many of the ideas that flow through it. Lawrence of Arabia is nothing short of brilliant.The movie is set in the closing stages of World War I where the British want to encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and destroy a thousand year regime. The period is constantly referred to in the movie as the Arab rising, and it is a rising for independence, not for overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence is sent to Arabia to liaise with the Arabs and try to unite them and send them against the Turks. He sees the opportunity to capture the port of Aqaba so that the British can land and attack the Turks from behind. Thus Lawrence sets out to capture the city and crosses what is considered to be one of the harshest sections of Arabia.Lawrence is a messiah figure. He believes himself to be as such for he compares himself to Moses. After capturing Aqaba he decides that he needs to inform the British and proposes to cross the Sinai desert. His Arab colleagues believe that he cannot do it, but he believes that he can. He crossed the desert to take Aqaba and they said he could not do it, but he did. As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later.Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams ""take no prisoners"" and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent.On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus.Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation.On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.",Lawrence of Arabia

The main character, the World War in the Middle Eastern Theatre of War against the Ottoman Turkish Empire and the treachery from his own country and his Superior Officers are indeed very complex and deserved something more than a black & white, right & wrong portrayal.The story starts out wit Mr. T.E. Lawrence, private citizen, taking a spin on his motorcycle, a short ride from which he would not return. We move to the Funeral, and like all funerals of the famous who die in tragic circumstances,* there are a lot of Big Wigs present, not to pay respects, but rather just to be seen.We also are privy to a roving reporter, stopping all the high governmental folks, asking of their knowledge of the deceased former 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Though the audience was then unaware that Director David Lean's cinematic device to both introduce us to characters from Lawrence's past, who we will be seeing again, later in the film.Among those who we meet are General Allenby(Jack Hawkins), now a Lord and an American Newspaperman & Newsreel Maker, one Jackson Bentley(Arthur Kennedy)which should be most interesting.This Mr. Bentley character is the one responsible in the film version for making Lawrence known to the world. This was essentially true, but for some reason the true name of this Press Agent for Lawrence and the Brits.The true identity of this American Newspaper Man is Lowell Thomas (1892-1981). He had been very active as a Newspaper Writer, as a Radio Newsman and a bit of a film maker, for it was two of his newsreel specials that made 'Lawrence of Arabia' into a household word. A sort of documentary compilation WITH ALLENBY IN PALESTINE AND LAWRENCE IN ARABIA (1919)was released after the War, and it started Mr.Thomas on the road to fame and fortune. (Also a very long career in Film(FOX-MOVIETONE NEWSREEL), Network Radio News and Television right up to the 1970's.(I well remember his HIGH ADVENTURE WITH LOWELL THOMAS as a 7th Grader,1958-59).Now getting back to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA(1962).A multi-faceted character would certainly require a multi-level, extra long epic sort of a film to tell the story properly. Well, they sure did that thing! We were all treated to a 216 Minute Epic which had the good sense and decency to have an INTERMISSION inserted right in the middle! And it sure seemed that the hour plus of viewing an awful lot of Sand and Dessert sure must have worked on our minds as pop sales in the lobby seemed quite brisk, indeed! As for the casting of Lawrence, Sir David Lean went with a newcomer, young, good looking and promising as an actor in Peter O'Toole. The very blonde haired and very blue eyed Mr. O'Toole gave us a T.E. Lawrence who was a sort of genius, who was out of step with the rest of the World, though Lawrence would definitely hold that it was the World that was out of step.He was highly educated and possessed super knowledge of Middle East History, Arabian Peoples, Islamic Religion and Arabian Language. It was while he was on staff a British Army HQ in Cairo that the idea of sending him on the mission to find Prince Feisel (Alec Guiness) was formulated.The eventual formation of the Arab Milita, which too forces loyal to Feisel and added more and more tribal warriors as time went by was a far cry from stories we are used to. The brutality of the dessert warfare and the frightful methods employed are most vividly portrayed. And what immediately comes to mind is a scene of an attack on a Turkish Railroad Train and its aftermath. As the attackers are 'taking inventory' of the goods on the train, a man in a bloodied up suit walks by in a seeming trance, obviously in a state of shock.The brutal blood letting scenes seem a little much at times, but it is done purposefully and not just for the sake of gratuitous violence. This David Lean was masterful in weaving a tale with some distasteful elements and maintaining a very mature, grown-up view and attitude. All the way from the start to the very end, this attitude is constant. There is no false glorification of War, nor is there any message that one could interpret as being pacifist. War is just there, we have to put up with it as best we can.The same sober realistic attitude is maintained with the alleged homosexuality of T.E. Lawrence. There are several parts of the story that sort of hint at it, but it is not mentioned, nor does the Director avoid the issue. His scene with Lawrence's being picked up and fondled by the Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer) was brutal, shocking and went far enough to get the point across; and to explain the great change in Lawrence's personality.If made by some lesser Director today, the whole sequence would be far different and much more graphic. A ""modern"" movie maker would have to 'draw a picture' for the audience, for the old fashioned virtues of subtlety and implication are not in the arsenal of film weaponry of these guys.And we must make mention of the beautiful, powerful and most memorable original score from the London Phiharmonic Orchestra, which makes our sense of hearing a full partner of our enjoyment.The Verdict on Sir David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is ****1/2 (four and a half stars.) See it for the first time or see it again!NOTE: * The ceremonies like this; Military, Policeman Slain in the Line of Duty, etc., always get turned into a sort of ""Show for the Pols and Police Brass.",Lawrence of Arabia
47,didi-5,impressive,10,16 April 2004,"This David Lean epic is often classed as a movie for the boys' but it has a lot to offer a mixed audience  topping his other lengthy work such as Dr Zhivago' and A Passage to India' this biopic of TE Lawrence took a gamble in casting the then relatively unknown (and extremely striking) Peter O'Toole in the lead role alongside Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer, and Anthony Quinn.  I think I am right in saying there are no women to be seen anywhere in the three hours plus of this film  it is to Lean's credit that the viewer doesn't necessarily notice this.Remembered for its strong visuals  the mirage scene in which Sharif appears from the desert mist, for one; the scene when Lawrence returns in Arab garb and is cheered by his army colleagues as a hero, for another  and stirring musical score (certainly among the greatest ever written)  this film doesn't shrink from presenting Lawrence as a rounded character with human failings like everyone else.  The longer cut released in the last few years underlines this complexity even more; and it still remains probably the best performance ever achieved by O'Toole.You do however still wonder what a version starring Dirk Bogarde would have been like (an abortive attempt some year before this version fell by the wayside).",Lawrence of Arabia
48,eddie_baggins,A stunning feat of film-making unwearied by age,10,11 August 2020,"Regularly regarded and spoken about as one of the greatest film-making feats of all-time, David Lean's seven time Oscar winning epic (clocking in at a bum-numbing three hours and 48 minutes), Lawrence of Arabia, remains to this day a staggering achievement, unwearied by age or the advancements that have come along since its release over 50 years ago.A director whose place amongst the most well-regarded artists in cinema is well earned after this effort and other features such as The Bridge On the River Kwai and Doctor Zhivago, Lean and his willing cast and crew went through well over twelve months of sweat inducing work to bring to Arabia to life on the big screen but their blood, sweat and no doubt tears were well worth it as the end results on screen showcase a film full of heart and soul.Filmed in the unforgiving wind-swept landscapes of Jordan where the films subject matter T.E Lawrence once roamed, Lean alongside his DOP Freddie Young (whose work here has become the stuff of legend) crafted a magnificent cinematic spectacle for the whole world to enjoy as we follow Peter O'Toole's career making turn as the renowned British officer who defied the odds to unite warring Arab tribes in a fight against the Turkish armed forces in the conflict of World War 1.We don't get to see anything of Lawrence's backstory or history leading up to his plight in the dusty lands of a country he has studied and appreciated for years leading up his charge, but thanks to O'Toole's lived in performance and Robert Bolt's finely considered script (which was based heavily on Lawrence's own written recordings), Lawrence is one of cinema's most fully realized portrayals of an historical figure, one that lived a life most would only dare but dream of.Focusing largely on Lawrence's relationships with Alec Guinness's Prince Faisel, Anthony Quinn's Auda Abu Tayi and Omar Sharif's trusty offsider Sherif Ali, Lean's film takes place across an incredibly vast canvass as we get intimate character studies taking place around the unforgiving surrounds of the environment these men find themselves in, a world that is dangerous in itself and torn apart by a violent and constantly foreboding war.An inspiration to many a filmmaker in the years following on from its triumphant release (the worlds most esteemed director Steven Spielberg has long said this is his favorite film), one could spend hours analyzing every portion of Lean's grand opus, from the achievements it had in crafting its set pieces, the designs of its 100's of costumes through to the wrangling of the elements that played out around its conception, but simply put, Lean's film remains a touchstone epic that would never be bettered should someone dare attempt to replicate its tale.Final Say -A ground-breaking piece of cinema, the years have not wearied Lawrence of Arabia, a career high-point for all involved and a stunning piece of film history.5 camels out of 5",Lawrence of Arabia
49,filipemanuelneto,"A great, timeless, classic of epic cinema.",10,24 August 2016,"This film tells an important part of T. E. Lawrence's life. A curious and highly intelligent man, joined the British Army during First World War and had a decisive role in the Arab Revolt of 1916 against the Turks. Directed by David Lean and scripted by Robert Bolt, it has the participation of Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif.T. E. Lawrence is one of the most interesting characters of the First World War. It wasn't a brilliant general or military, but got a huge part along the Arab tribes, disunited and often rivals, making them a highly effective troop (despite being composed of irregular militias). The film shows us how he got it and the price he paid (the scenes of violence when he was imprisoned by the Turks, although softened, can still suggest the alleged anal rape that he have suffered, among other tortures).The film is full of stunning scenes of the desert and is visually appealing, perhaps one of the epic films that gave greater attention to the use of natural landscapes to impress the public. The harshness of living conditions (or rather, survival) of the local tribes is also depicted with objectivity, as well as the importance given to water and control of wells. The action scenes were well thought out and show how the struggle was unequal, apparently doomed to failure (the Arabs battled with archaic methods and weapons, when compared to those used by Turks).The performance of the actors is something exceptional. The film is full of great players who have been at their best. Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif stand out naturally by the exceptional quality of their work, in a film that has become largely responsible for their consecration. The costumes are also excellent and, at least to me, seem consistent with the kind of clothes and uniforms depicted in photographs of the time, a sign of a good historical consulting work. The same can be said of military equipment shown. The soundtrack, an essential part of a good epic, is one of the best that has been done by Hollywood, having the signature of Maurice Jarre.",Lawrence of Arabia
50,Rectangular_businessman,A masterpiece,10,10 July 2010,"""Greatest biopic ever""...""Genius in 70mm""...""A Miracle of a Movie""...All these statements were said somewhere about Lawrence of Arabia. And its understandable. It was some kind of madness to make a movie like this. You know, working in the middle of desert for some long time, those extraordinary ways of photography,(Freddie Young kept constant diaphragm for all shots of the movie, Go Figure!) and working with that huge amount of actors...It was real madness.But it all works in a weird way. Lawrence of Arabia is more than a glorious, expensive, old biopic movie. Its just the ultimate movie about desert. I can feel the rays of the burning sun of Arabia desert every time i watch the movie, even if I'm watching it on a small 17inch monitor. Okay, lets say it doesn't have the greatest script ever, but the script also works because it doesn't try to solve the mystery about Lawrence. At the end of the movie we still don't know much about Lawrence. Compare it with another biopics that try to tell everything about the character they are depicting. Lawrence keeps the mystery and looks fresh every time you see it, just like Citizen Kane.Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies that define what great acting is. Some legendary actors play some legendary characters. Peter O'Toole shines all through the movie and shines eternally for the rest of cinema. If this was his one and only movie he still would be one of the greatest screen actors ever. Still, Alec Guinness may be the best of the best here. The way he shows the founder of Saudi kingdom is just unforgettable, funny and awesome all at the same time. Omar Sharif is excellent too as the macho Arabian who falls for Lawrence(yes. Lawrence of Arabia is full of gay themes)and Anthony Quinn arguably plays the ultimate wild, uncivilized man.Lawrence of Arabia is the perfect movie experience. Its overlong(for some people, you know), there is almost no woman in the movie(radical feminists may also hate the movie for that, believe me i have seen it!)and the ordinary man looking to learn something about history may not like it because it keeps many questions unanswered. Then again, Lawrence is not the ordinary movie for every man, though its utterly enjoyable and utterly watchable, its one of those very special works of art in the history of cinema that may not be very well understood but will always be praised.",Lawrence of Arabia

54,SAMTHEBESTEST,David Lean grows Greenery in the Desert...,8,19 April 2020,"Short Review :-Watched Lawrence Of Arabia (1962)David Lean grows Greenery in the Desert. 226 Minutes of pure filmmaking lesson from Legend David Lean. Lawrence Of Arabia is claimed as One of the Greatest Films ever made, although i disagree bit i also agree bit of it. Biographical drama and adventure comes together with majestic form of Cinematography and storytelling. One can complain about its long runtime but those were the days when they used to make Good Films with full content rather than money making spicy things like now days. Don't forget that 226 Runtime still won it Best Editing Award at Oscars. David Lean did a spendid job again just after The Bridge On The River Kwai in Lawrence Of Arabia with top notch directorial and presentation skills. A big cast is well handled and well trained to showcase absolute great acting skills but unfortunately couldn't win any Oscar. Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, Anthony Quinn as Auda and Omar Sherif as Sherif Ali take over the screen as if they were real characters. If i am praising David Lean for a wonderful Spectacle then Cinematography of F. A. Young and Music score by Maurice Jarre deserve special mention here. Overall, Lawrence Of Arabia couldn't connect me as it did to Arabians and Englishmen due to historic background but it is still enough to be called a Classic as a Mainstream Film.Rating- 8/10*",Lawrence of Arabia
55,l_rawjalaurence,Groundbreaking Account of an Old-Style Adventurer,9,23 June 2013,"What more can be said about this groundbreaking film from 1962 that has not already been said before? With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarré), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor. Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character. Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support. Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests. His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause. History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only Pyrrhic victories against the Turks.",Lawrence of Arabia
56,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The most grandiose biographical epic ever told,9,4 February 2009,"Not many studios around today would take a risk on a 3-hour and 45-minute epic tale taking place in a desert, and that's part of what makes ""Lawrence of Arabia"" such a remarkable classic. As long as it is, there's a sense of greatness as one watches the film: the camera sweeping across the desert and its majestic soundtrack pouring into your ears. There's no denying that as drawn out as the plot is, there's something powerful in every scene, whether its the beauty of the sun as it's caught on camera or the look on Peter O'Toole's face as he comes to yet another epiphany on his journey across the wilderness.O'Toole stars as TE Lawrence, a somewhat flamboyant but ambitious British soldier during World War I who is sent to Arabia where the Arabs are hoping to receive aid from the British in order to defeat parts of the Ottoman Empire. He ends up leading them successfully in a series of raids and battles and begins to suffer a conflict of allegiance between his British superiors and his Arab allies like Prince Feisal (Alec Guiness) and Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif).The film is of Lawrence's journey. He undergoes many transformations and learns many sobering lessons along the way, like the guilt of killing and even the lust for killing in addition to the fact that although he fights for Arabs, he himself is about as white as one can get. Clearly seeing that personal journey is what makes O'Toole's performance one of the all- time greatest. Most of the film is plot and its dialog either plot-oriented or intended to be quotable tidbits of wisdom. Lawrence is our only emotional access into the film and O'Toole just nails the part. The look in his soft blue eyes whether of anger, sadness or gaiety is utterly convincing. Without him this film would be flat and lifeless, no matter how exceptionally well made it is.And exceptional is one way to put it. Director David Lean chooses to keep the camera on the outside as much as possible, opting for the wide scene-setting shot whenever possible, only getting close-up if it's O'Toole's face illustrating an important point in his character's journey of understanding. It also lets the lavish sets and breathtaking locales become an important part of the story. His goal appears at times to simply overwhelm you with the majesty of the desert, much like Lawrence found it captivating despite being far from anything like home. It's not about creating an intimacy with the film; Lean wants to create awe for members of the audience and that's what big far-away pans and a long thematic score achieve.Every line of dialog in the film seems to have a poignancy. Almost like Shakespeare, there's wisdom and insight into the conflict being dropped in every line, with scenes ending on revealing and thematic ideas. Whether it's dialog building the complex portrait of Lawrence or the nature of the Middle East conflict, something of value is present nearly the entire film. The only thing missing is that women are virtually absent from the film, which in essence adds a whole other layer to it.Movies like ""Lawrence"" don't really get made anymore. While the occasional lengthy biopic comes up, the newer, fast-paced Hollywood simply can't handle too many of them or afford to budget over a year of on-location shooting for something so weighty. That's why ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is such an untouchable classic.",Lawrence of Arabia
57,funkyfry,Awesome film,10,13 December 2007,"David Lean created a film that has already stood the so-called test of time  in fact moreso, it has itself become the test and the measure against which all other war melodrama is compared. It has more to tell us about the struggle between the West and the Middle-East than any contemporary film I've seen. Here we have a strong contrast between the cynical career soldiers and diplomats (most memorably, Claude Rains in one of his last good roles) and an idealistic young man Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) who wants to ""help"" the Arab people establish their own state. But even with all his hope and his good intentions, Lawrence ends up destroying himself and perhaps leaving the Middle-East in a worse position than he found it. Lessons are to be learned from this film that still haven't been learned by all that many, despite its status as a revered ""classic."" There's simply too many strong elements in this film to talk about within the space allowed here  there are so many ideas floating around and so much beauty to behold on screen that every time I see it, it's like I'm seeing a slightly different movie that speaks to me about different things and inspires wonder in me that I've never felt before. With that in mind I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to stop reading, and also to try to see it in a theater if possible. Just to overview. Maurice Jarre's score is perfect; the instant you hear it you will always remember the images and characters of this movie. Freddie Young's photography has never been surpassed in terms of desert cinematography, and Lean manages not only to elicit deft performances from these actors but also to somehow keep the visual momentum flowing so that we're impressed with the monotonous nature and the isolation of the desert and yet never allowing the film's look to become totally static. For example when we see Lawrence sitting on the hill trying to decide if he should go South with Feisal (Alec Guinness) or lead some men West with Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) we get a kind of night-time blueish color and a kind of slow breeze moving the sand in ripples that makes the scene totally unlike anything in the rest of the film. When Lawrence, Sheriff and Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) reach Acuba, there's a stunning shot that pans all the way from the desert through the city and to the ocean, at the same time breathtaking its scope and beauty and strangely depressing and isolating because it communicates the idea that the ocean is just a desert made of water, and we humans are the unfortunate ones who must make a living in the tiny spaces between.The performances are astounding, all around. Guinness is capable of doing more than he's required to here in this film, but he has the proper majesterial presence and his face is like a riddle. Quinn is all fire and passion, perhaps representing the most limited version of Arab identity in the film but doing so with so much force that his character is unforgettable. But the first time I saw this movie as an adult, I was most impressed with the performances of O'Toole and Sharif and the way those characters were developed in tandem  Lawrence begins with noble intentions and ends up caught up in destructive and violent ego-fantasies, while Sharif begins as perhaps a petty and jealous man, shooting another Arab who dares to drink from his well, and becomes a politician with an appropriate amount of self-loathing and cynicism but who cares about the future of his people and believes in such a future more than Lawrence. The look on Sharif's face as O'Toole contemplates the fleeing Turkish army between his host and Damascus is one of the most haunting moments I've seen in any movie.I just can't say enough about how impressive this film is and how moved I am after watching it. It's really one of the most powerful films I've seen, worthy of comparison to other great epics like Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon."" And perhaps more than any other acclaimed war epic, this film succeeds as a character drama and really illuminates the character of Lawrence and his relationship to the war and to the people around him. I keep thinking of that scene where Lawrence has to shoot the man he rescued from the desert  great direction, perfect use of the ""reveal"" with the way he builds up the tension in the scene and then shows that it's the same man from the desert, multiplying the tension of the scene a hundredfold. Lawrence asks him if he did it, and seems to take solace in the fact that the killing is justified in some sense because of the man's guilt, but later confesses to great guilt because he felt pleasure in the violence. This scene prepares us for the crucial scene on the road to Damascus, and that look on Sharif's face represents the bitter recognition of what Lawrence has become. As long as this film is, there's not a wasted image or line of dialog. There's no feeling of self-indulgence on the part of the director or the writers; absolutely everything adds to the complex drama and helps us understand Lawrence and how he relates to the world around him. Perhaps people watch this movie and think it's a flawed film because Lawrence is a flawed hero  I think quite the opposite, that it's a great film because Lawrence is a flawed human being and not a hero at all.",Lawrence of Arabia
58,JohnSeal,Far from Lean's best,5,19 April 2006,"For those in need of a patriotic flagwaver, there's the deeply moving and magnificently written In Which We Serve. For those looking for a good literary adaptation, there's Oliver Twist or Great Expectations. For those looking for a simple but well told love story, there's Brief Encounter. And for those dying to spend a few hours watching The Great White Father rescue the Arabs from perfidy, there's this.Beautifully shot and well-acted it is, but ultimately I must side with the contrarians--most notably the New York Times' Bosley Crowther--who find Lawrence of Arabia an empty and extremely overlong epic that fails to cast any light on what made this amateur Orientalist tick. And frankly, why should we care anyway? This paean to stiff upper lip British resolve may have played better in 1962, before Britain withdrew from 'East of Suez', but now it seems a very odd picture indeed: a four hour film about a man who is ultimately little more than an historical footnote.Lean's next film, Dr. Zhivago, is even worse, but that hardly qualifies this as a 'must see'. Unless you are a World War I enthusiast, an admirer of widescreen photography, or Paul Wolfowitz, you can safely give Lawrence of Arabia a wide berth.",Lawrence of Arabia
59,Turfseer,Epic tale of revisionist history loses steam in second half,6,4 August 2021,"T. E. Lawrence, the British Army lieutenant who in the popular imagination was primarily responsible for defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I, was the perfect anti-hero for the revisionist 1960s. Iconic film director David Lean already had displayed his ""anti-colonial"" credentials in his 1957 portrait of an intransigent British army officer in The Bridge Over the River Kwai. But by 1962 when Lawrence of Arabia was released, he would go further in pouring gasoline on the fire to ensure that Britain's image as a noble colonial ruler was tarnished almost beyond recognition.Lawrence of Arabia is divided into two parts, with an intermission due to its four hour length. In the first part, we're introduced to newcomer Peter O'toole as the British lieutenant tasked with trekking through the desert at the behest of Mr. Dryden (Claude Raines) of the Arab Bureau to determine whether Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) will assist in the Arab revolt against the Turks who were allied with Germany during World War I.Part 1 portrays Lawrence as the heroic anti-hero (with Part 2 as more unheroic). At first in the vein of a good British colonialist he finds himself expressing contempt for Arabs following the appearance of Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) who murders Lawrence's Bedouin guide simply for drinking water from Ali's well in the middle of the desert.But after meeting up with Prince Faisal and hatching a plan to again trek through the desert against impossible odds with the intent of taking the strategic city of Aqaba in the south, Lawrence (completely the opposite of the British colonial stance at the time), takes a liking to the men he's charged with leading and begins identifying with them.Lawrence goes so far as adopting their dress and further earns their respect by turning around during the trek to Aqaba and saving one of the soldiers, Gasim (I. S. Johar) who falls off his camel after passing out.Lean and his scenarists take liberties with history by having Lawrence act on his own in leading the Arabs to Aqaba and failing to inform his commanding officer General Allenby (Jack Hawkins). As it really happened, Lawrence's superiors were fully informed of his bold plan in advance. Thus at this juncture, Lawrence's reputation as a hero is still intact.Nonetheless during Part 1, there is some foreshadowing of Lawrence's ""fall from grace"" to unheroic status in Part 2. That happens when Lawrence is forced to kill Gasim whose dispute with a member of another Arab tribe almost causes a civil war between the groups. Soon we see Lawrence ""confessing"" to General Allenby that he was troubled because he ""enjoyed"" killing the man.Lean's decision to characterize Lawrence as slightly bloodthirsty after (perhaps) adopting the cruel demeanor of the men he was commanding was ill-advised and disputed by several notable critics (including Lawrence's brother) who denounced this unsympathetic view following the film's release.Despite some slow pacing, Part 1 generally works plot-wise as Lawrence has a discernable goal (leading the men to take Aqaba). Lawrence as anti-hero is cleverly made clear when he returns to headquarters in full Arab dress and is like a fish out of water before his stodgy colleagues who are aghast when he requests that his Arab servant be put up in a first class hotel room. Nonetheless, he's given a hero's welcome after General Allenby recognizes his incredible initiative.Part 2 unfortunately does not have the focus of Part 1 and gradually loses steam. It consists more of episodic scenes with Lean attempting to interject a lot more ambiguity in regards to Lawrence's character. In contrast to the big attack on Aqaba, we're forced to be more content watching Lawrence blowing up trains while engaging in guerilla warfare.Then there's the scene when Lawrence shows up in the enemy-held city of Deera, arrested and summarily tortured after butting heads with the Turkish Bey (Chieftan--Jose Ferrer), Whether this incident was made up by Lawrence (appearing in his memoirs years later) is open to debate. But it's an opportunity for Lean to take down Lawrence's image another peg by implying that perhaps Lawrence intentionally wanted to be tortured-in order to atone for his sudden enjoyment of killing during warfare.The apotheosis of Lean's ill-advised characterizations of Lawrence perhaps occurs when he has him gleefully ordering ""No prisoners"" which leads to the massacre of retreating Turkish soldiers by his Arab charges on the way to take the city of Damascus. The context is not made clear-just like when Lawrence was forced to shoot Gasim. Here he must allow the troops to take revenge on the Turks, since they just massacred the residents of the Arab town of Tapas.Lean not only gets in his digs at his protagonist who is now rendered thoroughly unheroic but even worse, Lawrence's superiors (and the British Empire to boot) are held to even more severe account. Britain along with France carve up the Middle East after World War I (despite their promises to the Arabs, to the contrary), ending up completely dismembering the Ottoman Empire.Allenby gets particular short shrift after neglecting the beleaguered residents of Damascus (excoriated by the chief medical officer for allowing horrendous conditions in the local hospital). There at least is a little balance as the Arabs don't come off very well either-as they are unable to achieve any unity following the convening of their Arab Council.Despite the excellent cinematography, decent acting and memorable score, Lean goes a little too far in his revisionist history, unnecessarily playing down the heroic status of a confirmed anti-hero.",Lawrence of Arabia
60,thinker1691,""" Nothing Changed at Dara, . . He was The Same Man! """,9,14 October 2008,"The true story of T.E.Lawrence is hidden somewhere inside his personal memoirs. For the adventure-seeking Englishman from Oxfordshire, the Middle East was a land so remote from his that surely a man could become a hero, if he found the right location or conflict. Lawrence himself was a self taught expert in many of his interests. Having graduated from prestigious places, made him even more sought after by authorities, both academic and military. The film "" Lawrence of Arabia "" is laced with many actual events taken from Lawrence's own accounts, and it's difficult to separate fact from fiction. That is not really important for the Hollywood version in which Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence with such uncanny precision, the character overlaps the actual man. To add to the authenticity are the supporting actors such as Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal who is superb in his part. Anthony Quinn is Auda abu Tayi and is so convincing, many actual Arabs on the set accepted him as one. The main actor who gain hundreds of accolades while filming is Omar Sharif who plays Sheriff Ali. Jack Hawkins plays, General Edmund Allenby and Anthony Quayle is Colonel Brighten. The Turkish General is played by none other than Jose Ferrer. Claude Rains is the sly and slippery French minister Mr. Dryden. Arthur Kennedy is the American Newspaperman Jackson Bentley, seeking a story for his readers. When one views the film, it cannot but overwhelm as the vast but beautiful desert scenery and dramatic events convince the audience this film is fantastic in breath and scope. So highly recommended, it has achieved Classic status. ****",Lawrence of Arabia

62,jamesrupert2014,One of the greatest films ever made,9,26 March 2021,"T. E. Lawrence mobilises the disparate and warring tribes of Arabia to battle the Ottoman Empire during the First World War in the hope that victory could lead to an independent Arab nation. I've seen the film a few times over the years but recently watched the watched the 2012 restoration. Regardless of your opinion of the historical veracity of his portrayal, Peter O'Toole is magnificent as the highly-educated, erudite British officer who 'went native' only to be deceived by his own countrymen. The casting of Sir Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn as Arabs may raise hackles in these sensitive times but both are excellent, as is the entire cast, especially Omar Sharif (in his first English speaking role) as Sharif Ali, whose first appearance as a distant rider in a vast expanse of desert, is iconic. The cinematography is breathtaking, especially the dramatic views of the unforgiving desert or enormous set pieces such as the attack on Aquaba. A classic period-piece adventure and one of cinema's most celebrated epics (even if drama and adventure occasionally takes precedence over history).",Lawrence of Arabia
63,PWNYCNY,Good Hollywood Treatment of a Historical Subject,7,30 July 2005,"When considering the history of the relationship between the Arab countries and the West, it would be worth your while to watch this movie. This movie portrays a moment in history when the Arab people and the West were actually ALLIES, fighting together against a common enemy. Here a British soldier, Lawrence, actually risks his life in the cause for Arab independence. This is am incredible revelation. Peter O'Toole play Lawrence. Although O'Toole is at least a foot taller than the actual T. E. Lawrence, he nevertheless gives an outstanding performance as the enigmatic and heroic figure. Of course, one should not confuse this movie with a documentary, so don't cite this movie if you're doing a paper on the subject. But if you want to watch a credible dramatization of historical events and characters relating to the role of the Arab people in World War One, then this is the movie for you.",Lawrence of Arabia
64,ackstasis,"""Nothing is written.""",10,10 March 2007,"The parched vastness of the desert stretches beyond the horizon in every direction. The glorious morning sun begins to rise from beneath the earth, casting brilliant rays of searing light across the scorched landscape. In the distance, barely noticeable to the human eye, a dark speck appears. We watch, we wait. The tiny approaching figure, ever so gradually, moves tantalisingly closer, and we lean forward to discern it, the enormity of the Arabian desert instantly enveloping us, consuming us. We are there. When a character gazes up at the blazing overhead sun  an immense ball of fire in the sky  we feel it burning our skin, and we, too, yearn for that life-saving swig of water.David Lean's epic masterpiece, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' is one of those precious few films that is capable of completely absorbing the audience into its world. Just like Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi masterwork '2001: A Space Odyssey' of 1968, the plot of the film is not what we ultimately remember. When asked why it is such a great film, we can only recall the sheer majesty of the images that have been permanently seared into our minds  Lawrence blows out a burning match, which becomes the rising desert sun; a stranded soldier, stumbling across the sands, gazes up in horror as the first rays of morning sunlight beam across the land; a triumphant Lawrence, dressed in flowing white robes, poses at the summit of an enemy trainwreck, the sun glimmering behind him as if he is a god. Minute after minute, for the entire four-hour running time, we are simply bombarded with unforgettable images, thanks to the Freddie Young's acclaimed Super Panavision 70 cinematography, a stirring score from Maurice Jarre and director David Lean's epic cinematic vision.Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Edward ""T.E."" Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) died on May 19, 1935 after a horrific motorcycle accident. He was honoured with a bust in St. Paul's Cathedral for his liaison role during the Arab Revolt of 1916-18, his achievements made famous by the sensationalised newspaper writings of American journalist Lowell Thomas, who is represented in the film by the character of Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). Lawrence's funeral leaves us with several unanswered questions regarding what sort of man he really was: was he a ""poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior,"" or, as Bentley suggests after the departure of the reporter, ""the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum & Bailey?""'Lawrence of Arabia,' very loosely based on Lawrence's personal memoirs, shows how, throughout his exploits in Arabia, he was a man trapped between two cultures, torn between his allegiances to Britain and its army, and to his newfound comrades within the Arabian desert tribes, to whom he had promised freedom. He also battles to understand his own emotional reactions towards violence in war, his uncertainty beginning with the shocking satisfaction he experiences upon executing one of his companions. Early in his exploits, Lawrence embodies the qualities present in all great historical heroes: courage and determination, self-assurance and loyalty. Nearing the end of a harrowing march across the impassable Nefud Desert, though ragged from exhaustion and desperate for hydration, Lawrence turns his camel around in search of Gasim, a fellow comrade who was unknowingly left behind after succumbing to sleep and falling off his mount. However, as Lawrence's victories become many, he finds that his humility has been replaced with arrogance, and his bravery with blood-thirsty cowardice.The acting performances in this film are absolutely stunning all-round. Peter O'Toole (""The Lion in Winter"") is undeniably brilliant as T.E. Lawrence, masterfully portraying a complex character in his debut high-profile role. It is perhaps unfortunate that he came up against Gregory Peck's equally memorable role as Atticus Finch in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' at the 1963 Oscars, otherwise he most certainly would have won Best Actor. To this day, despite a total of eight nominations, O'Toole remains without a competitive Oscar, though he did receive an Academy Honorary Award in 2003 for his collective body of work.A stunning supporting cast complements O'Toole's performance, and the film simply could not have been as powerful if any of the supporting roles were anything less than perfect. Alec Guiness (""The Bridge on the River Kwai"")  who had originally wanted the role of Lawrence, but was turned down due to his age  plays Prince Feisal, the Arab leader who learns to value Lawrence's advice and assistance. Anthony Quinn (""Zorba the Greek"") portrays Auda ibu Tayi, the leader of the Howeitat tribe of Bedouin Arabs, whom Lawrence convinces to invade the city of Aqaba. Omar Sharif is brilliant as Sheriff Ali, a man who inexplicably becomes Lawrence's most loyal comrade, though he fears what his good friend has become in the face of success. Other notable performances in the film come from Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Anthony Quayle, Arthur Kennedy and José Ferrer.In terms of David Lean's vast artistic vision, 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings of all time. This is truly one of the grandest epics ever made, demanding to be witnessed only in the cinema; put quite simply, a minute television screen just does not do this film justice. This is an life-changing experience like few others, and, for 220 glorious minutes, you can almost see yourself in the desert, sitting atop a camel, trekking across the sands alongside one of the twentieth century's most fascinating historical figures.",Lawrence of Arabia
65,mjneu59,can only be appreciated on a really big screen,10,30 November 2010,"David Lean's stunning 1962 portrait of the fabled World War One adventurer is sometimes hard to pin down, and perhaps for good reason. Filming Robert Bolt's thoughtful script against the spectacular wide-screen panoramas of ace cinematographer Freddie Young, with Maurice Jarre's justifiably famous music score for support, makes it all too easy to overlook some of the finer nuances of such a complex character. Lawrence went into the desert not only to enlist Arab aid against the Turks, but also (in modern jargon) in a quest of self-discovery. In the end he found more than he bargained for, after being transfigured by the unforgiving landscape into something more than just an ordinary man, but something less than the near-deity all but worshipped by his Arab hosts. The length of the film (overture included) is intimidating, but seeing it again on the big screen shames the petty ambitions of today's ersatz blockbusters, proving in truly epic proportions that intelligent entertainment is not an oxymoron.",Lawrence of Arabia
66,drqshadow-reviews,Rise and Fall of a Philosophical Warrior,6,1 May 2018,"The sandy front of World War I, set amongst the dunes and political turmoil of Syria, Egypt and Jordan, as seen by a cocksure British army officer with maybe a little bit of a messiah complex. A true epic, from the breath-stealing long shots of an unimaginably vast desert to the explosive, well-outfitted battle scenes, it lives up to the billing and then some. I was mesmerized by the photography in particular, which constantly discovers new ways to portray what could have been a rather redundant, flat, boring landscape. Truly beautiful, almost ruminative at times, with an appreciation for the artisanship of film.As for the plot, well... it's a bit slow. Particularly so in the nearly four-hour director's cut, which feels completely unnecessary. I've never seen the theatrical release, which is noted for being incomprehensible in places due to the awkward cuts, but it seems suspicious that half an hour or more couldn't have been lopped off somewhere to improve the pace. It's an exhausting watch, and not just because of the draining personal transformation we see in Lawrence himself. There's good material, of course, plenty of it. The hopeless inner squabble of an Arab population that's desperately close to the unified independence they seek. The protagonist's progression from philosophical humanist to enraged berzerker to shattered shell. We get plenty to think about, long after the credits have finally, mercifully rolled, but it's a marathon to reach that point.A Best Picture winner that's technically marvelous, thematically challenging and open-minded, but the ending left me feeling cold and there's really no excuse for it to run for as long as it does.",Lawrence of Arabia
67,MBunge,A classic that is both captivating and enlightening,9,22 November 2010,"Lawrence of Arabia is one of the most beautiful films ever made, featuring tremendous performances and a boldly honest look at a complex man and the complex times in which he lived. But while it still ranks as one of the best epics in movie history, the passing decades have also recast it as one of the greatest cinematic testaments to the awesome power of distance that so dominated the affairs of men before the 20th century.T.E. Lawrence was a British army officer serving without distinction in Cairo during World War I who was dispatched by his country's foreign service to Arabia. His assignment was to observe and evaluate the fractured nature of the land and its Arab tribes and their ability to assist the British war effort against the Turkish Ottoman Empire. What Lawrence did was what no one since Saladin himself had achieved. He united the Arab people and led them to an astonishing victory, only to see that victory and Lawrence's dreams for the Arabs shattered against the relentless and unforgiving way of the world.It's hard to say which ranks first with this film. Is it the stunning, captivating bleakness of director David Lean's desert vistas or is it the electrifying and heart breaking Peter O'Toole as Lawrence? They each rank among the best work of their kind you'll ever see. I think the edge has to go to O'Toole because the vast landscapes and searing open spaces that Lean throws up on the screen would dwarf the efforts of most actors. Lean creates a world that emphasizes the smallness of man, making it that much harder for O'Toole to imbue Lawrence with a larger-than-life essence. That is exactly what O'Toole does, however, crafting Lawrence as a figure of staggering potential who finds his greatness realized and then spoiled by mundane realities even he cannot overpower by force of will.O'Toole is back up by a slew of other fine actors, particularly Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif and rival Arab chieftains who first doubt and then come to believe in Lawrence when he no longer does. Claude Rains is also almost unforgettable as Dryden the diplomat. He and Lawrence represent the twin sides of the British Empire. Lawrence is the heroism and the high ideals; Dryden the calculating, self interested reality those ideals were too frequently tamed by.Watching this movie today, beyond being grandly entertaining, is also a primer on the primacy of distance in human affairs. Though the locomotive had helped shrink much of the West by the end of the 19th century, other parts of the globe like Arabia remained trapped in the iron grip of how difficult it was to get from here to there. Before the airplane truly revolutionized travel, the most towering challenge that faced any man or people wasn't doing what they needed to do. It was getting where they needed to go in order to do it. When you can board a jet today, fly across the international dateline and disembark on the other side of the world yesterday, there may be no better way than watching Lawrence of Arabia to understand the limitations imposed on humanity by the burden of pre-Jet Age travel.Now, this film is long. I mean, it's loooooooooong. They stopped making movies this length over a generation ago. As entrancing as it is, and even with an intermission, this is still a viewing that requires some commitment. That's particularly the case because the second half where Lawrence is broken down by the burdens of his greatness and the immutable nature of his era is intentionally meant to be disappointing and dispiriting, at least on some level.Taking all in all, Lawrence of Arabia isn't merely an outstanding motion picture. This is a legitimate ""must see"" for everyone out there. If you haven't seen it, go rent itthough you might want to be sure and get it over the weekend so you've got time to watch it.",Lawrence of Arabia
68,CubsandCulture,Runs out of steam in the 2nd half as the main character gets simplified,8,13 November 2018,"Undoubtedly this is very good film. Filled with iconic images, scored with some of the most rousing music and anchored by O'Toole's deeply charismatic performance this is the film most people think about when they hear epic film making. If the 2nd half was as engaging as the 1st half I would wholeheartedly agree. As it stands I only halfheartedly agree. The 2nd half runs out a steam as the screenplay repeatedly decides to make Lawrence fit into the disillusioned soldier tropes. Worse the tensions and ironies of the character, say his love-hate relationship with violence, slowly and surely get resolved. By doing so the film is robbed much of narrative momentum.As scripted the story needs to be tightened up as the last hour or so simply crawls to a stand still. In particular a reworking of the Deraa assault should have occurred. While that scene is the impetus for Lawrence to be humbled and to realize he was ""ordinary"" it stands out as utterly unwarranted in the narrative. The film only hints at T.E. Lawrence's masochism and it doesn't imply that scene was an invention of his (as it probably was). It makes Lawrence's eventual descent into barbarism and setting up his disillusionment to pat and straight forward. This is especially true as the 1st half resists giving easy answers.Nonetheless this is a grand film that everyone should see once. It has a so much pure cinema in it.",Lawrence of Arabia
69,estebangonzalez10,The desert never looked more beautiful,8,27 March 2014,"""The English have a great hunger for desolate places. I fear they hunger for Arabia.""Lawrence of Arabia is the true definition of an epic film; the enormous landscapes in the desert were captured by Freddie Young through beautiful cinematography, accompanied with a magnificent score written by Maurice Jarre, a spectacular cast led by a terrific performance from Peter O'Toole playing a very complex character, wonderful art direction and costume designs which all contribute to some big scale scenes. Director, David Lean, has created one of the most memorable films and it still stands amongst the best movies in history more than 50 years after its creation. Lawrence of Arabia is the go to movie when you want to make an epic film because it has it all. My only complaint for this film is its running time (almost four hours long), but Lean deliberately directed it this way because he wanted the audience to experience the lengthy and difficult journey through the desert. The heat and the dryness of the desert transcend the film and the audience is expected to experience it first hand. It is not an easy film to watch, it requires your full attention and the pacing at times is deliberately slow. The characters are flawed and their motivations aren't always easy to follow. It is a complex film, but the journey is one worth taking. Lean took a huge risk by directing such a big film that wasn't going to be easy to produce, but the grandeur of it, is what made this such a memorable film. This is a masterpiece considering it does everything absolutely right, but it isn't exactly entertaining throughout its entire runtime. I still prefer Ben Hur, another epic film which I found much more entertaining, but I know this is a much more perfect film which delivers in all the technical aspects. When thinking of this ambitious and epic film it will be very hard to forget the gorgeous and magnificent scenery which hasn't seemed to age one bit. This is a film that could've been a disaster in the making, but Lean pulled it off masterfully delivering a masterpiece.Based on the life of Thomas Edward Lawrence, the screenplay was successfully adapted from his autobiographical book by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is a British intelligence officer serving in Cairo during World War I. He is assigned on a mission to assess Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) who is revolting against the Turks, and therefore assisting the allies. This is where Lawrence's long journey begins. Once he meets with Prince Faisal he immediately catches his attention for being outspoken and unconventional. Against the advice of other British officials, Lawrence recommends the Prince make a surprise attack at Aqaba which was a strategic port held by the Turks. Lawrence convinces the Prince to provide him with only 50 men to make a surprise attack by land. He allows Lawrence to take some of his men led by Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) and together they embark on another dangerous journey through the Nefud desert. On their way they encounter Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn), the leader of a powerful local tribe, and Lawrence convinces his men to join the cause. Thanks to this strategic allegiance, Lawrence manages to overtake Aqaba, and soon he becomes a respected man among the Arabs and a center figure in their war against the Turks. The film centers on Peter O'Toole's lead performance and he delivers. He plays a complex character who makes some strategic decisions, but who also is conflicted about his allegiance to the British army. The journeys in camels across these dry and hot deserts are beautifully shot. The cinematography was way ahead of its time and the scenery was captured marvelously. The score also plays an important role in this film and it's no surprise it remains as one of the best scores in film history. Lawrence of Arabia is just a stunning film that delivers in all the categories. It won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, but unfortunately O'Toole and Omar Sharif didn't win for their great performances. The dynamic relationship between both their characters was also the heart and soul of this film. I'd include Anthony Quinn in the mix as well considering his character provided some well needed comedic relief. The mid section of this film was the most entertaining, while the opening and closing sequences lacked better pacing. It is an astonishing film to look at and the characters are captivating. If the film weren't so long I might have enjoyed it more, but I have to agree this is a perfectly executed epic film.",Lawrence of Arabia
70,iquine,Epic Adventure Full of Grandeur,8,27 April 2020,"(Flash Review)You know you are in for an epic film when the first 4min 40sec is only intro music over a black screen! Peter O'Tool carried this 3:48 epic film which is impressive. Impressive too was the score, the amount of extras and the endless Arabian dessert which was a character itself. The story is a chronicle of British Lieutenant T. E. Lawrence's life gaining power in the Arabian desert. He is sent off to get an inside scoop of the Arab rebellion against the Turks during World War I. Will his rebel and confident personality, he eventually unites a diverse groups of Arab tribes to fight the Turks. They embark on an arduous journey across the harsh dessert to unexpectedly attack the Turks with the goal of helping the British General destroy the gargantuan Ottoman Empire.

71,Lechuguilla,Visual Grandeur,8,5 June 2013,"Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place.So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash.The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: ""What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?"" To which Lawrence responds in two words: ""It's clean."" Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered.Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times.My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with ""Intermission.""""Lawrence Of Arabia"" was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.",Lawrence of Arabia
72,Nazi_Fighter_David,A film that literally excites the senses...,10,29 November 1999,"David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is one of the few films that legitimately deserves to be called great It appears on virtually all ""ten best"" lists and reveals deeper layers of meaning with repeated viewings Lean, a man devoted to the art, gives ""Lawrence of Arabia"" its spectacular values... He unifies the sand and the sun to flame out the silver screen... Maurice Jarre's terrific music escorts the appearance and disappearance of the sun below the horizon in the sleepy desert...""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a prodigious labor, a masterful mixture of fact and artistry, a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse, a film that literally excites the senses... In a visual sense, Lean combines a sure sense of place with an approach to the action that he borrows from an unlikely sourceJohn Ford Lean turns his vast desert canvas into another Monument Valley, and when his Bedouins ride across it, they are not far removed from Ford's cavalry In many of the early scenes, the stately gait of the camel's walk gives the film a slower pace, and this is precisely what Lean is trying to achieve Lean even manages to surpass Ford with his understanding of the relationship between his characters and the landscape; how the desert changes those who go into itThe film is the story of a solitary adventurer who always knew he was different, but in Arabia he discovers that his proportions are heroic... Perhaps this is the secret of Lawrence of the legends  that at the bottom of all the violent action is a protagonist about whom one cares... A puzzling personality whom one glimpses but never fully understands... Throuhout the picture one has a sense of a man discovering his own unique dimensions...Lawrence's mission, largely his own creation, is to unite the feuding Bedouin tribes under the leadership of Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), and to keep the British politicians, as personified by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains), from putting the Arabs under their colonial thumb after World War I is over It is accomplished through a semi-episodic series of battles and raids where Lawrence is sometimes accompanied by Ali (Omar Sharif) and Sheik Auda (Anthony Quinn), and equally difficult bureaucratic struggles he faces with Gen. Allenby (Jack Hawkins).All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence here: The stretch desert with its white golden sands; peril, anywhere and everywhere; dangerfor Lawrence of Arabia is a film about guerrilla warfare; prowessLawrence crosses Sinai on foot; physical tortureLawrence in the hands of the Turkish bey; impossible mission Lawrence takes the seaport of Jordan from behind; ruthlessnessLawrence shouting 'take no prisoners' leading his men to put to death a Turkish column... Every component is here, everything one needs for a great adventure film, many spectacular sequences, each of them so perfect: Lean cuts to the sun again and again, turning it into a character; the scene in Feisal's tent when Lawrence first talks with the king; Lawrence striding on top of a captured train, parading before rows of cheering Arabs; the scene between Lawrence and Ferrer illuminating Lawrence's strange perversity, a mixture of masochism and repressed homosexuality; the scene when a Beduin prince appears on his camel, an exceedingly long take in which a strange figure is first resolved out of waves of heat and then, as he approaches, becomes a frightening threat to Lawrence's escort at the desert well...The photography, the script and the acting are so superb that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" becomes a lavish epic winner of 7 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Directing, Color, Cinematography, Sound, Muscial Score and Film Editing...",Lawrence of Arabia
73,barnabyrudge,Could very well be the greatest film I've ever seen.,10,26 January 2005,"Lawrence of Arabia is an outstanding film on every level. Performances, direction, music, cinematography, characterisation, costume design, editing and story-telling - all outstanding. Every shot is beautifully composed; not a word in the epic-length script is wasted; and Peter O'Toole as the titular character gives the greatest performance that I've ever seen given by any actor, at any time, in any film. The film is also remarkable for the level of planning and preparation required to pull off the more spectacular scenes (no CGI back in 1962, remember, so every one of the thousands of extras on screen - even the ones in the distant background - are there for real). I learnt recently that if this film was made nowadays exactly as it was back then, the cost would be close to $300,000,000.Cairo: 1916. The British Army show interest in various Arab uprisings against the Turks around the Middle East. It seems presumable that if the disparate and disorganised Arab factions could be united, they could be fashioned into a force capable of denting the Turkish Army. Young, bored officer Lawrence (O'Toole) is ordered to contact the Arabs and to establish the feasibility of transforming their bickering tribes into a single fighting unit. Ambitiously - perhaps manipulatively - Lawrence intentionally exceeds his orders. He befriends Prince Faisal (Alec Guiness), Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn), and Sheriff Ali Ibn El Kharish (Omar Sharif) - the main Arab figures in the region - and convinces them to pool their men and their resources in order to smash the Turks. Without authority, Lawrence leads his new guerrilla unit into battle - seizing Aqaba from the ""impossible"" desert side; rolling on into Deraa so fast that the British Army can barely keep up; and ultimately capturing the prized city of Damascus. Along the way, he is captured and (sexually?) tortured by the enemy, emerging from his ordeal a cold, distant shell of his former self, but still driven to complete his incredible quest.This is an amazing film, and I refuse to take seriously anyone who proclaims themself a genuine film buff if they haven't seen it. Director David Lean weaves the story with assured skill, subtly showing Lawrence's evolution from a nondescript army officer, to an inspirational idealist, and finally to a blindly arrogant ""lost soul"" who realises too late that his quest has robbed him of his humanity. Freddie Young's photography seems to focus in on every grain of desert sand and every nuance on the actors' faces. This is the best cinematography ever to grace a movie screen. The actors deserve every accolade that has been heaped upon them, but O'Toole in particular should be singled out. His Lawrence - clad in sweeping white robes, much to the chagrin of his stiff upper lipped superiors - has become an iconic screen character every bit as identifiable as King Kong atop the Empire State Building or Janet Leigh screaming in the shower. If this isn't the greatest film of all-time it's undoubtedly in the top five. How many other films can you name that are nearly four hours long and yet every second commands your attention (even during subsequent viewings)? It should be made a legal obligation to watch Lawrence of Arabia at least once in your lifetime, it really is THAT good.",Lawrence of Arabia
74,Kdosda_Hegen,"It's good but, nothing special.",7,6 August 2020,"I was so hyped for this film. Sadly, I did not find it special. The first half was great, it felt like an epic, the second half was mostly about politics, I did not enjoy that much.",Lawrence of Arabia
75,slokes,Lean's Grandest Spectacle,10,8 March 2006,"To watch ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" is to be refreshed anew with the power of film, a visit to a pleasant oasis of perfect delight and contentment after crossing the arid desert of today's movie scene.I don't blame modern movie makers. I blame David Lean. He set an impossibly high standard with this film, an epic that plays like serial adventure, with rousing action sequences, multi-layered dialogue, gorgeous camera work, a deep-bodied musical score that feels at one with the desert, and a cast of exceptionally good actors all working at their absolute peaks, led by then-newcomer Peter O'Toole in the title role.His Lawrence is both bigger than life and quaintly eccentric, rubbing his fellow British officers the wrong way when we first meet him as a humble mapmaker in Cairo.""I can't make out whether you are bloody madman or just half-witted,"" says the general who sees him off on his new assignment, ""appreciating the situation"" among Bedouin warriors fighting the Turks in a World War I backwater.""I have the same problem, sir,"" is Lawrence's reply.O'Toole plays him as a consummate dreamer, unhappy in his Western skin and desirous of challenge and change, and for that ultimately no small risk to himself and others. This is soon revealed when he generously presents a revolver to his Bedouin guide Tafas (Zia Mohyeddin does a lot to establish the film's early exotic tone before bigger names arrive to play the Arab parts). Later, Tafas is killed by the gift when he attempts to use it on a strange figure approaching him and Lawrence across the mirror-like horizon. As time passes, we discover how dangerous Lawrence's gift of military power can be for other Arabs, too, and how that doubles back on Lawrence. ""Lawrence is a sword that cuts both ways,"" observes Alec Guinness's sly Prince Feisal late in the film, at which point Lawrence himself is about cut to ribbons.Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are very, very good playing off Lawrence and each other. Sharif is a revelation as Ali, shifting from dangerous adversary to calming ally and finally disaffected brother of Lawrence, the moral center as Lawrence strays into bloodlust and self-deification. Quinn provides much of the comedy as rival chieftain Auda, yet also the embodiment of Lawrence's unstable situation as he seeks to make a nation of Arabs. Auda doesn't understand the concept of ""Arabs."" He just sees rival tribes to chivvy with.One thing you are struck with watching ""Lawrence"" is it runs nearly four hours but feels more like 90 minutes. That's of course testament to a lot of things, but the editing by Anne V. Coates is not pointed out enough. No scene feels too long, and while that is a product of Lean's direction and a story by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, Coates' clever cutting sets a standard for epics by working ""off-the-beat"" as it were, anticipating a scene change by making it a half-second early, as in the famous one where Lawrence blows out a match and leads us into the desert. Coates had great fabric to work with, of course, but tailors it perfectly. It's a wonder and a shame she and Lean didn't work together again.Some films, very good ones, start strong and fade in the stretch. Others build momentum as they go along. ""Lawrence"" is different. The film grabs you right away, and even as we lose some things we miss, we gain other elements we enjoy, creating an ever-changing spectacle that defines the Hollywood epic in its purest form (made by a Brit in Morocco, I know.) It keeps building like a symphony, unfolding with patient vibrancy like some perfectly realized life outside nature.Picking the best parts of ""Lawrence"" may be difficult, but it's easy for me to name my favorite scene. It's whatever part of ""Lawrence"" I am watching whenever I watch the film. Which isn't often enough!",Lawrence of Arabia
76,caspian1978,Beautiful Direction,7,15 April 2001,"Overall, Laurence of Arabia is just that. A beautiful directed film. From its long shots of the deserts to the dramatic close ups of Peter O'Toole, the film is beauty. Winner of the Best Picture for its year, Laurence of Arabia is a winner of taste and enlightenment. All you have to do is shut up and gaze at its wonder of a film. The scenes speak for themselves. Why would you need dialogue.",Lawrence of Arabia
77,Steffi_P,"""Another of these desert-loving Englishmen""",9,12 June 2010,"Ever since the heyday of Douglas Fairbanks, cinema has been in love with the iconic image of the rugged, gritted-teeth outdoorsman, through actors like from John Wayne to Clint Eastwood, and directors like Victor Fleming and Raoul Walsh. In the more analytical, less adulatory cinema of the mid-50s onwards, these fearless heroes became the subject of lengthy character studies. These sometimes proved just as popular as their lighter ancestors, so long as they contained the necessary dose of action and adventure to add flesh to the bones.Lawrence of Arabia is, as character studies go, pretty gargantuan, and really quite devastating in its complete unravelling of the nature of heroism. But such ruminations needn't necessarily be revisionist or provocative. The screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson begins by inspiring us with admiration for the man, and leaves us filled with pity for him. It is an incredibly concentrated piece of characterisation, but what is rather neat about it is that it says very little directly about Lawrence, besides vague and sometimes conflicting statements. Demons such as his sadistic and masochistic streaks or his inability to fit into military or indeed Western lifestyle come across through his actions – not through his words, nor the words of those who speak about him. This is not only a very powerful method of storytelling but it is a very realistic way of showing the disparity between the man and the myth. Those demons of course come to dominate the character and the picture.This emphasis on ""show, don't tell"" (which is of course the essence of all great storytelling) is given life by the vibrant visual direction of David Lean. In Lawrence of Arabia his images are constantly shifting between the historical reality of the broad canvas to the emotional intensity of an extreme close-up. This is also his way of keeping the story in motion. The cut from the blown-out match to the desert sunrise is of course very well known, but in fact Lean begins and ends almost all his shots in this snappy manner. Even cuts within in scenes tend to give completely new colouring, scope and movement. However the actual shots themselves often consist of gradual shifts in tone, with objects hoving into view or slipping out of sight. It's a fairly literal approach to film grammar (cuts are for changes, shots are for movement) and this makes it extremely effective.In fact the direction of David Lean here looks even better than it really is thanks to how in tune the entire production team was. Editor Anne V. Coates (who is still going today in her mid-80s) took on the mammoth task of aligning all of Lean's jarring cuts, and did a perfect job of it. Maurice Jarre not only created a score which fits the tones of the movie (that main theme, with its hints of Arabic melody, conjures up both the hot splendour of the desert and the cool quench of the oasis), but one which dances expertly to the tune of Lean's images, even working in seamless switches in timbre and melody to coincide with the edits. The sound design too takes the reigns wherever a visual change might be too abrupt – for example the creaking of Feisal's tent after he utters the words ""I fear it"".With such a flawless production job, the actors in Lawrence of Arabia seem simply to slot into place. Peter O'Toole is of course very good – introducing Lawrence as a softly-spoken and unassuming hero, bringing out the calm wisdom which passes for charisma, and finally showing the desperate conflict that was going on inside – but one could not say it is a performance that commands the picture. The character as he is written and presented commands the picture, but O'Toole does not. Omar Sharif's is the best performance we see, filled with a very realistic alertness and sense of indignation. Compared to him, it's a little disappointing to see Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn give somewhat trite interpretations of wise Arab leaders, but at least they are true to the demands of the story and hold up their parts of the movie. Fun fact for you: It wasn't just Caucasians being (mis?)cast as Arabs. I.S. Johar, who plays Gasim, was Indian and a fairly big star in Bollywood.I think what makes Lawrence of Arabia so appealing both then and now is that it shows us the tough, outdoors-loving warrior hero, sweeping us along on his adventures, and yet doing so without lying to us about the strains and disappointments of such a lifestyle. Straightforward realism makes for dull viewing, but no-brainer action can be hollow and unmemorable. Lawrence of Arabia gives us the best of both worlds, with a delicate precision that is beautiful in itself.",Lawrence of Arabia
78,truemythmedia,A Perfect Film,10,23 May 2019,"I love this movie; it has one of the most interesting characters in epic stories, and what's even better is its based on a real person. I know it's a cliché, the cinephile lamenting that they don't make movies the way they used to, but you know what? They don't. This is a jewel from the golden age of Hollywood, back when the words 'epic film' meant more than just the size of the explosions they showed you (looking at you Marvel and DC). It really spoke to the scope of the characters, the sets, the story itself, and the amount of work that went into creating an artistic vision this brilliant.
This is one movie that I think everyone should see. It's more than fifty years old, but it still has more impact than ninety-nine percent of the epic films that come out today. Yes, it's long; yes, it takes patience. So what? Wait for a rainy Saturday, a frigid snowy Sunday, and make a day out of watching this movie. I promise you wont regret it.",Lawrence of Arabia
79,davidmvining,A grand entertainment,10,29 September 2020,"This is one of the titans of cinema. A movie so large in scope and in reputation that it becomes a bit of a hopeless exercise to talk about it because so much has already been said. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, David Lean's epic portrait of T.E. Lawrence is a monument of what an epic can be in terms of scale and sweep that it often gets overlooked that at its core is a rather telling story of a man's descent into a madness, much like Colonel Nicholson's own descent in The Bridge on the River Kwai. It's also a piece of historical fiction that may or may not have a whole lot to do with the actual characters involved. Some family members were so aghast at the portrayal of General Allenby that they lodged a formal complaint with Columbia Pictures.Based on Lawrence's own account of the Arab Uprising in the First World War, Seven Pillars of Wisdom, the movie begins with Lawrence's death on a small country road in England, jumping back in time to his days as a lieutenant and clerk under General Murray. One thing to be said very early about this film is its incredible use of transitions. The most famous one is of Lawrence blowing out a candle and the film instantly cutting to the shot of the rising run over the desert, but I think the transition from the funeral to the small basement office where we find the young Lawrence is indicative of Lean's control over editing from his years as a leading editor in Britain's film industry.We go from General Murray talking to a reporter about how Lawrence had some minor position on his staff in Cairo to a shot of a hand coloring a map. Based on the dialogue we just saw and the sudden change in visuals, we instantly know that we're not only somewhere else but that we're in Cairo and that hand is Lawrence's. We don't need a long establishing shot of the city to understand exactly where we are and when we are. We know that we're at a point before Lawrence got famous because of how Murray talked about Lawrence's insignificant position there. It's instantly conveyed in a single cut, and it's a great use of the tools of cinema.Now, a comment about the film's length. It's just shy of four hours, and I think it earns every minute. The first hour or so builds up to several things, selling the reality of each of them to the audience. The first is Lawrence's vision. He sees a united Arab population in Arabia able to govern itself. The second is the reality of the desert. It's hot, it's big, and it's punishing. The third is the political reality of the different Bedouin tribes that make up the Arab population and how they are almost always in conflict over some reason or another. Those reasons don't matter to Lawrence, of course, because his vision is what's important.Lawrence's inability to see reality because of his vision is really at the core of everything in the movie for him. It's most obvious in his desire to become an Arab, something that's never really said explicitly but shown repeatedly especially at his lowest moment when he reveals his white skin to his friend Sherif Ali late in the film after his torture at the hands of the Turks. He had snuck into a Turkish controlled village thinking that he was invisible dressed as an Arab, able to simply disappear amongst the locals, and he was found out easily. He's not an Arab, and he never will be. It manifests other ways like in how Lawrence fought against the cruel impulses within him but he cannot deny them. When he executes a man, the very man he had saved from death in the desert, he's horrified that he actually enjoyed the act. He runs from that until the final charge against the retreating Turkish column towards Damascus when he orders an attack that's not necessary and he gets into the thick of the battle like he had never done before, getting covered in blood much to Ali's horror.The final big fantasy that falls apart is Lawrence's vision for the Arab world. It ends up falling apart for two reasons, one internal and the other external. The first is that the Arab world of Bedouin tribes are simply not cohesive enough to come together. Presented with their first seat of government in Damascus, they can do nothing but bicker over slights both current and past. There's going to be no way for them to come together the way they need to in order to overcome the external forces of Britain and France coming to an agreement to split the Turkish Empire, including Arabia.Underlying all of this is the common motif in Lean's work of the temporary giving way to the permanent. Lawrence's vision gives way to the original reality of the tribes fighting each other. They were together momentarily because of the war, but it falls away as soon as it's over. Lawrence's embrace of his deep tan on his face and the dressings of a Bedouin give way to his white skin underneath and the uniform of a British officer. He goes through these massive events, and in the end very little seems to have changed. The Arabs still are disunited and under a colonial power, England and France instead of the Turks. Lawrence has led the Arab army, but he still has to go home to England.The movie is simply impeccably made, the result of a craftsman learning his trade over decades and applying the tricks of that trade intelligently. The opening up of his camera that began in The Bridge on the River Kwai goes exponentially further in Lawrence of Arabia. Vast vistas with tiny figures feature prominently throughout the film, and they never feel extraneous. These are moments where the hugeness of the desert needs to be sold to the audience. The smallness of the characters needs to be felt acutely. The journey across the Nefud Desert needs to feel arduous, dangerous, and deadly, and you can't do that in a couple of quick shots. Letting those moment linger as the audience begins to feel the heat of the sun on the Sun's Anvil is key to selling the audacity of the plan Lawrence had pursued with Ali to reach Aqaba by land. The action needs to feel big, bold, and monumental. It can't feel easy. Lawrence needs to suffer through it, and showing the audience the hugeness of the expanse is part of doing that.David Lean grew up in the industry with his small films about people, usually married people dealing with marital problems. That focus gave him a great gift with actors, something one might not expect from a director who arose from a technical field like editing, and he applies that gift to every actor in Lawrence of Arabia. The newfound Peter O'Toole won an Oscar for his performance as Lawrence, and he deserves it, showing us a flawed man who grows to believe his own myth and has it come crashing down. A man who is at war with his own impulses and his own desires. Omar Sharif is wonderful as Sherif Ali, the companion who grows to understand not only Lawrence's greatness but his great flaws as well. Alec Guiness in brown face is great as Prince Faisal, the closest thing the Arabs have to a leader, with cool, intellectual control of every movement of a king to be. Jack Hawkins embodies the smugness of General Allenby perfectly. Anthony Quinn is maniacal, violent, and deeply felt as Auda abu Tayi. Universally, the cast is fantastic.The music is strong from the young Maurice Jarre with a theme that seems instantly recognizable decades later. The battles are filmed clearly and from afar, showing off the incredible scale of the production without ever losing sight of the intimate feelings of the characters at the center.It's a production of the highest order with an intelligently told study of a man at its center. This is more than just a critics' delight, this is grand entertainment.",Lawrence of Arabia
80,Spleen,I've never seen anything like this before ...,10,15 June 2000,"I mean, wow.  Of the 72 films to have won a Best Picture Oscar, David Lean has directed two; and I suspect (but I'll let you know when I've seen them all) that his are the best two.  The other one is ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"".  This is almost Kwai's companion piece.  In some ways Colonel Nicholson and Lawrence could scarcely be more different: the former is completely transparent, the latter utterly opaque.  But both films are studies in wartime leaders with unusual codes of honour.  Although both films are tragedies, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a far greater tragedy: it's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" with all the optimism drained out.  It is terrible, sad, bleak, exquisitely depressing.  So why does it leave audiences feeling so exhilarated?  Why does one find oneself walking on air out of the cinema?  Simply, I think, because it's so very, very good.  Like Beethoven's music, it will thrill you even if it's in a minor key; possibly it will thrill you and sadden you at the same time; but certainly it will thrill you.The photography is so perfectly adapted to the wide screen that it couldn't possibly make sense on television.  Any network executive who screens this film has committed a crime.  I'm amazed how real everything looks: almost every shot is so convincing one thinks it couldn't possibly have been planned, yet so perfect, it must have been.  -But once I begin to praise the elements of the film one by one I will never stop.",Lawrence of Arabia
81,onepotato2,half an epic,6,15 January 2008,"When I first saw this, I was leaving the phase of my life where I could be tricked by good production values into thinking I had actually seen quality. A friend of mine loves it, but you could probably write ""great man narrative"" on an index card and show it to him and he would get excited and start clapping. I'm open to a ""great man narrative"" but at 4 hours, I'd like other supporting ideas, and belonging to the most advanced species on the planet, I have this goofy idea that a movie should ask me to think. At it's worst, Lawrence is a motion-postcard. I'll watch ""Being There"" 20 times for each viewing of Lawrence of Arabia.At the time of my first viewing, it did remind me how vivid location photography is, compared to junky attempts to fake it; the photography is simply amazing. Even by the half hour mark, it's really well-made; editing, crisp lenses, great restoration. As epics go, it one-ups competitors like Spartacus by shooting every single exterior scene in the great outdoors, and never cheating inside the studio. It's also remarkable to see a director in the 60s willing to shoot at a darker end of the spectrum than Hollywood is comfortable with.But the movie is a hard sell. Maurice Jarre's theme is shoved down your throat at every opportunity. In a 4 hour movie, it would have been nice if subsequent musical motifs were developed. Whoever decided we should first hear the theme under the credits, while we look down at ten square yards of a motorcycle court should be shot. Is there something transcendent about concrete? A very clumsy & dumb decision.Early on the movie addresses rare topics, like male camaraderie, the naturalized expatriate life arc, etc. As it continues it becomes more generic and less well-made. It gets into heraldic, hagiographic mode and can't escape. Sadly, the ""only one man can save us"" line of crap has been paying regular dividends ever since. (Everything from Dances with Wolves & The Postman to every Schwartzeneggar movie) To miss the very high quality of the first hour or two is a crime, but when I get nearer the end, I begin to sympathize with its detractors. Bombast is one of my least favorite flavors. I really doubt if most fans understand what the hell is going on in the movie. The developments and conflicts feel pretty arbitrary.Despite being wrong on many many details, a movie that could both reach the western audience and not treat Arabs like villainous scum is notable for doing exactly that. What it says for diplomacy and the rewards of working past cultural barriers is, for me, more important The first two hours are a pleasure, but I've never seen a movie yet that can make art out of massive social movements. The last hour offers nothing comparable to the rest of the movie. It reaches the height of idiocy when every single person in a sort of huge Arab congress has to depend on the single white man who can save them. And scenes of O'Tooles quivering, bug-eyed version of crazy is extraordinarily unsubtle in a movie playing in 70mm. The most annoying recurring detail is the cutesy appellation ""Orrence"" they give to him, despite the fact they can all pronounce ""L"" just fine everywhere else. Phony pidgin English is not worthy of the movies better ideas.",Lawrence of Arabia
82,Seraphion,Great work in focusing on the cultures and cultural clashes,6,6 November 2014,"The movie sure takes it's time to build on the story. It does so even a little bit too much for me. The opening sequence can be done better with a shorter sequence. The whole story gets pretentious and patronizing even from the very beginning. But it sure does depict the culture differences and the culture shocks Lawrence had very well. Those depictions occur very much at the starts when he was first stationed in the Arabia, the journey to Faisal and the later journey to Aqaba. Lawrence's reactions and his reluctance in doing much of his reactions did very much the justice of one stranger in a new world of culture. The acting is quite an example of a transitioning from a rigid dialog of the old styled movies to the modern style of more fluid conversations in the movies. Peter O'Toole did well as Lawrence, capturing all those diverse and sometimes contradicting emotions and expressions. Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness did nice in giving the balancing angle to the story as well as giving the Arab taste to the movie. But then again, for me the movies only appeals just as that and not as special as everyone else thinks.",Lawrence of Arabia
83,RatedVforVinny,Directed by the master crafter David Lean.,9,24 April 2020,"They certainly don't make them like this anymore and there is no one else left around who could possibly craft an epic like David Lean could. He meticulously took months to plan each shot and for just one scene, constructed over three hundred buildings. Peter O'Toole, gives his definitive performance as the heroic Lawrence and backed by an all star cast, in sweeping, true tale of a British maverick Colonel. There are some very unusual and artistic images that totally work and many fine details throughout the three hour duration to enjoy (and savour). Total cinema as an art form and this craft has basically been lost for many a year.",Lawrence of Arabia
84,Movie-ManDan,All Around Perfect!,10,13 August 2015,"Lawrence of Arabia is said to be the best epic ever made and I understand why. In order for an epic to succeed, it has to hold the viewers' attentions throughout the film. Of course there can be moments of down time, but every movie has that. Lawrence of Arabia not only holds attention, it feature everything to make a great movie at all-time heights.Lawrence of Arabia is easily the best movie made about the First World War. Being the best epic is arguable, but there's only a margin of movies about WW1 and none are simply better than this. Newcomer Peter O'Toole is dead-on as Thomas Edward Lawrence--a role many people say he should have won for instead of Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird. If O'Toole did win, the backlash would be the same. I personally liked O'Toole and Lawrence of Arabia more. Lawrence is a hip and cool soldier who wants adventure and is assigned to help Arabian tribes face the Turks. He unites the different tribes and leads them to victory. Throughout the movie are beautiful images of the sun clearing the sky in the deserts of the middle-east with glamorous music. Watching this movie is like looking at an ocean sunset. No matter how many times you see this or how bored you get, you will not be able to take your eyes off this.Anybody that does not like this obviously misses the underlying themes and characterizations. As I mentioned, O'Toole is captivating. But everybody else is amazing too. Alec Guinness plays Bedouin Prince Feisel who was actually mistaken by residents for the real prince. Lawrence is a complex, multi-layered character who is one of cinema's all-time greats. He is a rebellious misfit who brings his theories with him to Arabia. Seeing it is his biggest challenge, he tries to become one with the army while still keeping his own self. Lawrence is an idealist. When he turns out to be a success, he lets it all get to his head and his ego grows. He unites the tribes and leads the men in courage than only he could give. We understand why Lawrence becomes vain, but still want him to keep his general humility. When a tragic situation changes his whole perspective, he wants out but his influence brought them far. That is where the themes of inspiration and leadership/influence really soar. Despite a terrible trauma to him, he still stepped up with the aide of people he once inspired to fight. He gained everybody's loyalty and friendship--two crucial things the movie is about. Just one man whom everybody doubted created such a bang and legacy that forever changed history. When the war finishes, unity breaks with disagreements but there is still some peace among the groups. I found that to be realistic instead of a picture- perfect happy-ending where everybody becomes best friends.I wouldn't say Lawrence of Arabia is sad entirely, there's just one depressing scene. But it is not happy either. It is all fully realistic and we have characters and situations where we can be proud of. The movie succeeds in everything it tries to get across, which is more than enough. Literally everything this movie has is perfection.4/4",Lawrence of Arabia
85,justin-fencsak,This movies deserves to be seen on the largest screen possible!!!,10,7 June 2019,"When i first saw this movie on VHS years after it was reissued in a restored director's cut in the late 1980s, I enjoyed it . Then I bought the DVD and then bought the bluray and liked it more. One of the longest movies ever made that won an oscar for Best Picture and made Peter O'Toole a household name along with the namesake Lawrence, who at the beginning of the film dies by crashing his motorcycle before flashing back to 1910's Arabia. The music is classic, and the direction by David Lean is superb. Like most movies released during the era, there is an intermission. This film was shot in 2.20:1, which is 70mm aspect ratio.",Lawrence of Arabia
86,JuguAbraham,"Who are you, Lawrence?",9,26 August 2001,"It is wonderful to learn from the DVD of the movie that it was David Lean, assuming the voice of the motorcyclist, who shouted across the Suez Canal to Lawrence those significant words ""Who are you?"" How appropriate!! The director asking the question to his protagonist. What is fiction, what is history? Watching the movie some 25 years after I saw it the first time, one begins to wonder if the real T E Lawrence will ever stand up. In the movie, in his writings ""The Seven Pillars of Wisdom"", Lawrence will remain an enigma both to the West and the Arabs.The ""real"" David Lean does stand up. He is a great director of epics and Lawrence, Doctor Zhivago, and Ryan's Daughter are his three best films, followed by Bridge on the River Kwai, which unfortunately does not affect you as much as it does on the first viewing on repeated viewings as the other three.Lean, Jarre, and Bolt--what a combination! Hats off to the restorers of this film. The only odd-ball was Anthony Quinn who seemed artificial 25 years ago and even now when we learn his costume was not authentic in color. I always wondered why I S Johar was picked by Lean to play the role of the guy who falls off the camel, is rescued, and is shot later. I have met Johar in real life. He was well read for an actor but I never rated him as a great actor. But for Johar this was the greatest performance of his career. 
All in all a great movie with great performances--each time you watch it you appreciate it better.",Lawrence of Arabia
87,philip_vanderveken,An excellent movie that needs to be seen several times in a row.,9,19 July 2005,"Is there a better reason why you should watch this movie than being an admirer of classic films and having a great interest in good war movies? Sure, there are plenty, but I didn't know them before I watched this movie. In fact, I didn't know all that much about it except for the fact that it was made in the sixties and situated in Arabia during WWI. I'm almost ashamed to admit this, but I didn't even know that it was made by the same director who made the excellent ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". T. E. Lawrence is a lieutenant in the British Army in North Africa during World War One. He doesn't like his current assignment (coloring maps) at all and is thrilled when he is offered a job as an observer with Prince Feisal, the leader of an Arab tribal army. From that moment on his life takes an unforeseen twist as he becomes one of the greatest leaders of the Arabian revolution against the Turks. Watching this movie is a journey back in time. Not only because the story is situated about 90 years ago, but also because this is a movie from a time period in which they still knew how to make epic movies without too many special things around it. They didn't have computers to enhance all their images, but had to rely on excellent acting, a great story and what nature provided them with. And all these things are amazing in this movie. Take for instance the acting by Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn,... who are all excellent. Not that I expected anything less from such a cast, but sometimes you can end up very disappointed when you have very high expectations, but that's certainly not the case this time. What I also liked a lot were the magnificent landscapes which seemed to be accentuated by the terrific music by Maurice Jarre. Those landscapes wouldn't have looked that great if they hadn't been shot well of course, but it's clear that the entire crew knew what it was doing. I could go on for hours about this movie, but that would bring us too far. All I still want to say about it is that I'm convinced that this movie can no longer be made. Not only aren't there enough great and magnificent actors to play the many different roles, the makers would probably add a lot of computer animated graphics to it, spoiling the purity of the entire film by adding a fake sand storm or something like that. No, this is a movie the way they made them in the old days with some very fine acting, a good story, some nice music,... I give this movie at least an 8.5/10. If I ever get the chance to see it on DVD, instead of watching a badly taped television version, this rating will probably go up. But despite that 'problem', I can assure you that I'm already a fan and an admirer of this magnificent epic movie.",Lawrence of Arabia
88,screenman,Beyond Superlatives,10,9 April 2012,"If ever a movie earned the definition 'epic', then 'Lawrence Of Arabia' is it. In an age when sumptuous set-pieces can be effortlessly conjured-up by computer programmers, this truly authentic feast of cinematic vision still possesses the power to blow your mind. This is the real thing. The wide-sweeping vistas of desert wilderness are not special-effects; they are REAL. And they look real. Long views, sweeping pans and takes sustained over minutes are realised with a clarity, colour and vividness that absolutely melt your heart. That imagery is a more believable conduit to this complex man's evolving obsession with Arabia than the narrative itself.Every scene is a breathtaking study in light and colour, character and dialogue. Every second is worth seeing and every word worth hearing. And its theme music is as iconic as the man himself.The inimitable Peter O'Toole with his blonde hair, steely-blue eyes, haunting expressions and mood swings, commands your attention in every take. His Lawrence is a man swallowed up by a personal sense of destiny, striding between his cynical and prosaic taskmasters and a doomed belief in what might be achieved with superhuman effort. Omar Sharif never played a better role as foil to his capricious hero. Unusually, there are no leading ladies. And they're certainly not needed. A love interest would have cheapened the entire presentation. Here is a story about the romance of time and place. As that other great Arabian traveller and admirer of the ideal - Wilfred Thessiger - once remarked; ""women spoil everything"".This is a long movie. Those with short attention-spans raised upon sausage-machine editing are doomed to find it dull, tedious, boring, slow and all of the other criticisms that fall from the lips of a generation accustomed to x-box action sequencing. But if you are blessed with a longer vintage, then Lean's masterpiece will swallow you up as surely as the desert itself.",Lawrence of Arabia
89,bkrauser-81-311064,A Spectacular Marvel,10,10 January 2014,"Lawrence of Arabia (1962) is a bit of an oddity everywhere its title is listed. Considered by the American Film Institute to be among the best American films, Lawrence of Arabia is hardly an American film. Its protagonist is decidedly British and the film was a co-production between Horizon Pictures in London and Columbia Pictures in Hollywood. In addition, the British Film Institute also claims it as its own, so there's that.While considered an epic and features breathtaking natural vistas, the film is an epic quite unlike any other. Lawrence of Arabia isn't Gone with the Wind (1939) and it's certainly not a production of the Hollywood hagiographical machine churned by Cecil B. DeMille. It's a movie that has no equal and apart from maybe The English Patient (1996) has no real imitators either.The film is based on the true story of T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), a British intelligence officer who fermented Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks during WWI. Lawrence is considered a very controversial figure both in his native Britain and in the Arabian Peninsula. His personality alone isolated him from his fellow officers in the British Army who found his assuredness awkward. When he gained the loyalties of King Faisal (Alec Guinness) and helped unite Arab tribes under the Arab National Council to occupy Damascus, the British and the French became worried of his intentions and reined him in.Those who know the history of the region will recall that after the events depicted in the movie, the French occupied Lebanon in 1920 thus fulfilling the Sykes-Picot agreement. The Arab National Council was disbanded in 1930 though were never the most competent administrators, and the region didn't enjoy the fruits of free determination until the 1940's.While politics and political brinksmanship is an aspect of Lawrence of Arabia it isn't the only aspect, or even the most important theme in David Lean's masterpiece. Lawrence of Arabia aspires to embolden the unconventional. To make us aware of an individual who, while being a small cog in a big machine, was too unique to be replaced, altered or replicated. The famous tableau in which Lawrence slowly moves towards the frame from a mile away against the harshness of the desert is a visual metaphor of such an aspiring theme.Heck, even Peter O'Toole's physical shape and body language is a visual metaphor for the value of unconventionality. His frame is lanky and frail and his body language and speech patterns balance between discreet and cocksure. Yet while his physical appearance is the antipathy of modesty, his every action is done with grandeur. While everything he says is said softly, what he says is self-assured. He has the heart of Othello born in the body of Iago.At 216 minutes long, Lawrence of Arabia may not be for the huddled masses populating today's movie theaters, but the film has been a must see for the last 50 years for good reason. Anyone who claims to love films and does not like Lawrence of Arabia must loose all credibility. Tough talk coming from someone who didn't think 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) was all that and a packet of bubble gum. But the plain truth of the matter is Lawrence of Arabia is a masterpiece in storytelling, in filmmaking, in entertainment and in artistry. The fact that it's an hours-long sprawling epic just makes it all the more impressive and all the more required viewing.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Lawrence of Arabia
90,denis888,Most Overrated Piece Of Terrbile Cinematography,1,3 March 2013,"Why on earth is it considered one of the best? Can anyone explain this mystery to me? The film is just awful - outdated, slow, clichéd, skewed, biased, unrealistic, propaganda-driven, silly at times, overtly naive and very very long. Peter O'Toole? Can he play? He can. Not in here. Here, his uneasy array of homo-hints, blank stare, evidently weak acting, very unnatural emotional display, shallow delivery and generally very irritating mimics. Omar Shariff and Alec Guinness are no better with their laughable gestures, bad lines and unconvincing acting. This is a very overrated piece of time movie, which belongs to where it should be - in the past, as a result of very poorly executed epic saga ewhich drags and dies along. My advice - watch it, but then drop it. There are better movies in this world... THis one is a real waste of time.",Lawrence of Arabia
91,brogmiller,Desert loving English,10,12 March 2020,"One cannot really add much to the superlatives heaped upon this undisputed masterpiece, adapted by playwright Robert Bolt from T. E. Lawrence's 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom'. Director David Lean himself has admitted that he 'got it wrong' on a few occasions. Firstly in not having the courage to hold Omar Sharif's entrance for longer and secondly in not making it clearer that Lawrence was not only beaten but also buggered by the Turks. The film suggests that Lawrence did not know about the Sykes-Picot Treaty but only 'suspected'. He almost certainly did know hence his burden of guilt at having betrayed the Arabs. These are minor quibbles of course and do not detract from the films magnificence. It would be nigh on impossible of course to assemble a cast of this quality now. When Lean and cinematographer Freddie Young met on the set, Young said 'Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs'. Lean very wisely took his advice. At the films premiere the Duke of Edinburgh enquired of Lean:'good flick is it?' Lean's response? 'I hope so, sir'. Something of an understatement!",Lawrence of Arabia
92,intelearts,The cinematography alone is breathtaking,10,25 March 2008,"I watched El Cid last week and Lawrence this week and you could not see two more different films: both may be about heroism but one is old-fashioned, theatrical, and exploding with action and color; the other is an extraordinary canvas of film filled with simple, devastating images that invade and linger, that takes its time and creates some of the best shots on film.From a technical viewpoint Lawrence is extraordinary, it really does look and sound and feel like it was made now. The film looks fresh, there is none of the artificial colors of films prior to Lawrence: it is truly a masterpiece of film and one that deserves a very special place in film history.I firmly believe that David Lean changed film: films after Lawrence are simply more lifelike more real less theatrical less acted, but are also more carefully shot, with the color and lighting far more subdued and real.Of course, Lawrence, is also about heroism, character, and a unique individual: but it is in the combination of both the film and the story that the film's greatness lies.Simply stunning.",Lawrence of Arabia

Over the objections of General Murray, Mr. Dryden of the Arab Bureau sends him to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal in his revolt against the Turks. On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sheriff Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sheriff Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence. They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. Gasim succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim—and Sheriff Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi, the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a blood feud. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself.

95,sme_no_densetsu,Feast your eyes on this!,9,27 May 2008,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a film that is commonly ranked among the best of all time. Epic in scale, masterful in execution, it is the sort of film that transcends entertainment and enters the realm of art.The most striking part of the film is the visual aspect. The sweeping desert vistas are breathtaking but it is the technical expertise that elevates the visuals to another level entirely. If there is a single fault with the direction, cinematography or editing I didn't see it.The film also boasts an instantly memorable score by Maurice Jarre, justifiably lauded as one of the best of all film scores. It would be difficult to imagine a piece of music that could match the stellar visuals but this is it.Peter O'Toole is excellent as the title character and the supporting cast is also quite solid. Particularly good is Omar Sharif, who received an Oscar nomination for his efforts. Jack Hawkins and Anthony Quinn also deliver fine performances.I have to admit, though, that the first time I watched this movie I wasn't particularly keen on the story. However, on a second viewing the script revealed itself to be a complex portrait of an enigmatic figure. While there are unanswered questions these merely add to the richness of the film.In conclusion, this is the very definition of a 'must see' film. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is just as impressive today as it was fifty years ago.",Lawrence of Arabia
96,PimpinAinttEasy,Visual beauty makes sanctimonious handing tolerable .....,7,11 May 2014,"Probably the most visually stunning film that I have seen in my whole life. The visuals in this one would put to shame the visuals in the greatest of Westerns. The grand vistas are the grandest ever.But PETER O TOOLE's sanctimonious portrayal of Lawrence got on my nerves. There is no other way of putting it - he was too feminine and irritating (I checked on wikipedia and apparently LAWRENCE was a homosexual). Brando (to whom the role was offered initially) would have done a better job even with his mumbling. ALEC GUINESS was also a real pain, I mean he was hilarious. Apparently DILIP KUMAR was offered the role played by OMAR SHARIFF (who was brilliant).And the story doesn't get really interesting until just before the interval. The film does offer some terrific insight into the Arab psyche. Basically the Arabs were parasites who had no interest in democracy and could not run a country properly. They depended on the British for various systems to continue and the moment the British retreated, everything fell apart completely.The British were no better. Their flexible morals and deceitful imperialistic ambitions made them play one side against the other quite easily.The film had this very sanctimonious tone throughout, the main character was completely unlikeable and I don't think TOOLE played him very well. And nor were the filmmakers successful in showing what a nefarious person Lawrence really was.LEAN might have made some visually stunning films but I guess he always worked with a big budget. he is no KUBRICK or POWELL/PRESSBURGER.The film did make me wonder about the remarkable men produced by England and what the country has become today.(7/10)",Lawrence of Arabia
97,bobsgrock,An epic masterpiece and portrait of a great man.,10,14 November 2008,"Without serious qualms as one of the greatest stories ever brought to film, Lawrence of Arabia shine bright and long throughout as the portrait of one of Britain's finest heroes and of a man who attempted the impossible and nearly accomplished it. More than just a fascinating story though, it is also one of the most well-made films with breathtaking cinematography in virtually every scene and flawless acting that more than carries the weight of the film. The heavyweights are of course Peter O'Toole as the title character, who perfectly captures the feeling of isolation and detachment Lawrence felt from his own people (English) and those he tried to help (Arabs), as well as Omar Sharif as Lawrence's ally Sheriff Ali, Alec Guiness as the determined Prince Feisal and Jack Hawkins as the loyal yet sly General Allenby.Perhaps the real heroes of this film, though are those working behind the camera, particularly screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson who cover lots of territory yet conceal it into a very cohesive script with some excellent scenes of dialog. And, of course, director David Lean shows his true talent at telling epic tales by flawlessly directing and keeping pace so that the film is long but never boring. If you love or even like movies, this one is a must-see. Long considered one of the finest films ever made, you will not be disappointed by any of it. Rather, it will leave you breathless, amazed, and dazed at the wonder of the desert and the history that took place in it.",Lawrence of Arabia

99,TheUnknown837-1,one of the grandest epics of all time. David Lean's masterpiece.,10,27 November 2008,"Three of my favorite films of all time fall under the category of the epic genre. What they all share in common are their grand scale, a large scale of popularity, and a running length of over three and a half hours. And while The Ten Commandments (1956) is my overall favorite of the three, David Lean's masterpiece Lawrence of Arabia isn't far behind, nor is Akira Kurosawa's marvelous Seven Samurai (1954).Lawrence of Arabia tells the slightly fictionalized story of T.E. Lawrence, a Welsh soldier who inspired and led an Arab revolt against the Turkish Empire during the times of World War One when his native country was more concerned about fighting the Germans. The film stars Peter O'Toole in the performance that made his career and he commands a supporting cast that includes great actors such as Academy Award-winners Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn as well as Omar Sharif, who was nominated for his performance in this grand epic. While some elements and characters are entirely fictional, invented for the film, director David Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt did a fantastic job at bringing this true story to the screen so that people other than historians can remember what the real man did.Like many classic films, Lawrence of Arabia underwent many editing changes after it was first released. Scenes were dropped, plot holes were opened, and somehow the film reel was reversed so that David Lean's intent of making it seem like a journey was lost. Of course, during the eighties, Hollywood went in to restore the film, reinstall the scenes that should have never been taken out in the first place, and flipped that reel so that everything looks like the way Lean intended it. Now the true masterpiece can be seen.The film is brilliantly made from its acting, to its scenery, right down to the fabulous music score that accompanies it in the background. Many scenes are composed of nothing but camels trekking across the desert under the heat of the sun and yet these scenes do not drag. One thing I really admired about Lawrence of Arabia was the way the filmmakers chose to represent the Arabs. While they did in a few instances cast a Caucasian actor, most of the time, the Arabs are portrayed by people of Middle-Eastern descent. For example, Omar Sharif, who is Egyptian. And in the cases where a Caucasian actor is used, it's still convincing. Anthony Quinn is so heavily clad in makeup that I didn't recognize him until I heard his voice and then I had to check the credits to make sure. Apparently, Quinn was very enthusiastic about making himself look like an Arab since he was portraying a real-life person. That is completely admirable since wearing makeup as well as putting it on is far from comfortable.Unfortunately, film industries do not make movies like Lawrence of Arabia anymore because audiences these days seem to seek the more modern style, but at least these grand masterpieces are still available for viewing. This is a very long film and I did feel slightly worn-down at the end and I did spot one scene where Lawrence visits a Turkish hospital that really served no purpose in the film and could have easily been cut, but still, I highly recommend it.This is a masterpiece.",Lawrence of Arabia
100,gizmomogwai,"Exotic and grand, for reasons I can't fully explain",10,29 June 2009,"Recently I was told I have attention deficit disorder, which admittedly, wasn't too much of a shocker. Over the past few years I've found more joy in short films than the longer ones; hence, why I loved the Canadian show ZeD since it featured lots of short films. I also watch some TV shows where episodes are only 20-22 minutes long. I enjoyed The Dark Knight (2008) but thought it was a bit too long- two hours and twenty minutes. Then there's Lawrence of Arabia (1962)- almost four hours long! Yet the movie is good enough that I actually don't resent it for its length. I don't think I'd cut anything from it. I'm not sure if I've seen it in one sitting, but it's actually compelling viewing.The film is set in World War I with the British hoping to undermine one of its enemies, the Ottoman Empire (here mostly called Turkey), by assisting the Arab revolt against it. The British officer TE Lawrence (played by Peter O'Toole) particularly becomes committed to giving the Arabs their freedom- even from his own people, the British. He leads Arab warriors to some victories over the Turks.Lawrence of Arabia won the Oscar for Best Picture and the American Film Institute twice ranked it as one of the top ten best American films ever, although Lawrence of Arabia is typically considered to be a British movie. Still, it is deserving of the praise it gets. Maybe for cinematography, but I've heard that's really most impressive on the big screen. I've only seen it on my small TV and laptop, so I can't say that's really why I enjoyed the movie, although I did find the setting exotic. I'm not totally sure what the message of the movie was, and sometimes I found some of the scenes difficult to understand. But I am particularly interested in history, politics and war, and I guess that probably explains a lot of the film's appeal. Lawrence of Arabia captures the subject of achieving greatness. This includes a single man becoming great, with Lawrence becoming a hero to the Arabs and an inspiring figure to the British and Americans (through media attention), and with Prince Feisal becoming a king. O'Toole plays Lawrence in an interesting way, with emotion and conviction. Feisal, an Arab, is played by Alec Guinness, who is decidedly not Arabic- but he plays the part well, giving the character a feeling of power and wisdom. It also includes the story of how a people became great- Lawrence calls the Arabs a ""little people"" at the start of the movie, but they're not by the end. Perhaps it can be said Lawrence achieves greatness by finding his place in the world, among the Arabs, showing one can find one's place in the world anywhere. But he does leave Arabia at the end of the movie. Maybe he was one of those unfortunate people who couldn't find his place anywhere. This movie, however, has a definite place in cinematic history.",Lawrence of Arabia
101,telegonus,A Dissenting View On Lawrence Of Arabia,7,2 April 2001,"This is a film generally hailed as great that I believe is merely good, and at times mediocre. Yes, Fred Young's photography is magnificent, Robert Bolt's script far more intelligent and clever than the average screenplay, and David Lean most definitely had an flair for spectacle. All this is true. Many of the actors are good, too. But it goes on too long and doesn't explain enough of Lawrence's personality. Mostly, though, what ruins the film for me is its pretentiousness. Lean is simply trying too hard: for beautiful effects, stunning shots of the desert, sweeping moments, ironic ones, lovely shots of pretty things and ugly shots of evil things, all captured to perfection by his beloved camera. The movie is funny and disturbing and true to life, at other times larger than life, it is a history lesson and an action picture, a thinking man's spectacle...but it's shoveled down my throat and I resent it, and half-way through I want to spit it out. Art is to a large extent made up of artifice, however, artificiality should not be the main thing but rather one of the many things one likes about a work of art. Lawrence, it seems to me, is pure artifice, and not much else. Let me give an example. There is a scene near the end of the film when the various competing factions among the Arabs are debating over what to do in the post-war world. Suddenly, the lights dim in the great hall where they're all gathered. At first I thought nothing of it, a nice touch, maybe even true. Then, as I pondered the matter, I got angry with the scene and the film for the obvious symbolism: the lights are England, the hall is the Middle East, the sun is setting on the British empire, on the West in general, and the Third World shall triumph despite its lack of much technical know-how (the lights). Instant term paper! Moments like these, and Lawrence is full of them, turned me off,--how shall I say--big time? To make matters worse, Peter O'Toole's prancing-mincing-detached-ironic-aristocratic posturing wore me down early on, as I found him increasingly repulsive as the film dragged on. Nothing in Lawrence is natural and alive. It all seems so thought out. I agree that a tremendous amount of talent went into the making of this overrated so-called classic, but the result is just a lot of, well, hot air. (Sorry I didn't go into the story itself here, since I am assuming, probably incorrectly, that most people are at least casually familiar with the life and times of T.E. Lawrence).",Lawrence of Arabia
102,jaredmobarak,Nothing is writtenLawrence of Arabia,9,23 March 2007,"Lawrence of Arabia is oftentimes listed as one of the greatest films of all time. Not only that, but many say Peter O'Toole's performance as T.E. Lawrence is the greatest piece of acting ever to be captured on screen as well. Being that the movie was made 45 years ago, I wasn't going into it thinking I would agree with either statement necessarily. Whether the four hour run time was too daunting to get my hopes up or not, I knew that no matter what, I needed to finally see this film. I was going to go for the ride from Cairo to the Middle East along with the band of Arab tribes trying to take back their land from the Turks.On a technical level, Lawrence of Arabia has few equals. Director David Lean has created something with true epic focus. There are no advanced computer graphics multiplying fake people into huge battle scenes, this had to be done with real extras, sweltering in the desert heat waiting for their opportunity to fight amongst the movie's stars. The scope is wide and Lean is never afraid to show the desert as a desolate wasteland because the shots are beautiful to behold. The British didn't understand what Lawrence saw in the sand, but viewing the landscape shots here, the audience can see the tranquility and beauty that it truly holds. This was a big-budget movie and it shows by the settings besides the desert. When we arrive in Cairo and see the excess with which the soldiers live; its affluence is on display. Not only by the material objects, but also by the soldiers' utter ambivalence to the fight while their Arab counterparts are trekking through the sun-ravaged desert to claim victory.It is this juxtaposition between the British forces and Arab fighters that backbone the film. Yes, T.E. Lawrence is the focal point and his journey from army outcast to Arab liberator is the story arc we follow, but it is the fact that he tries to live in both worlds which really defines the course of actions on display. Credit does have to go to Peter O'Toole for his ability to grow his character throughout and display the emotion and conflict living inside him. Lawrence saw an opportunity to help the Arab tribes regain control of their land despite Britain's refusal to give them artillery. Even at this early moment, he might have suspected this lack of true support as a sign of future motives, but he was so focused on his cause and the fact that he could do anything he set his mind to, he just didn't care. When he finally succeeds with his first mission, he returns a broken man, having killed and seen things he never wanted to see. He knew it was all for the best, though, and needed to stick by his word of setting his new friends into a free land. Only when the men at Cairo, who once laughed at his expense, praise him with accolades and promotions does Lawrence first start becoming a man without a clear purpose. A man that was accepted by no one now finds himself loved by two distinct cultures, and must somehow cope with the success or eventually fall as a result.Besides the excellent performance by O'Tooleintense, sarcastically humorous, and heartbreakingly real throughoutwe are also treated to an acting clinic from the supporting players. Omar Sharif is fantastic as the Arab Sheriff Ali who agrees to accompany Lawrence on his suicide mission to take a Turkish outpost. Sharif gives Ali a realistic progression from a man who cannot see a white man surviving anything in their future, to one who would follow Lawrence into Hell if asked. Anthony Quinn is also great as Auda abu Tayi, a leader of a tribe that can be bought by whoever offers most. His interactions with O'Toole are some of the best moments in the film because Lawrence always knows what to say to persuade Auda into doing something for his own interests and not for monetary gain, (although he still likes to take something as a souvenir for his troubles). Even Alec Guinness brings an effective performance despite playing an Arab Prince. There are many moments where the allusions to his later Obi-Wan Kenobi character come through making me smile, but the accent is hidden nicely into a British educated Arab speech that helps me forget he is as much an Englishmen as O'Toole is Irish.In the end, however, it is the story which truly leaves a mark. During the runtime, I was slowly seeing some redundancies and wondering if an hour could have easily been chopped off without a second glance. Disappointment was setting in and I was thinking I might have to give it a 7 or 8 rating as a whole. Once the final scenes play out though, you realize why we needed everything that came before. It is Lawrence's success in battle that both leave him broken but also ripe for persuasion into continuing on. The British were looking for a way to have Arabs do the work but eventually swoop in and take the Middle East for themselves, and with Lawrence, they had their man to rally the troops. Lawrence was neither British nor Arab, but instead a man beyond his dreams and ideals. The Arab tribes would never be able to live in harmony for a peaceful unity, and the British were just waiting for the implosion to occur. When all is said and done, Lawrence realizes he is not the God that people, and himself, saw him as, but a pawn that has been played from the beginning. His sanity and drive for good is sucked out of him because while it seemed he was accepted by both worlds, he really didn't belong to either.",Lawrence of Arabia
103,gftbiloxi,"A Desert Myth: Perhaps the Finest Film ""Epic""",10,29 March 2005,"To understand the Middle East as it presently exists, one must understand World War I and its consequences for those who live in the region. In making such a study, one inevitably and repeatedly encounters the name T.E. Lawrence, then and now one of the most controversial military figures of the 20th Century, a remarkably complex man who combined an unassuming manner with an astonishing flair for self-promotion.Lawrence authored an account of his Arabian adventures following the war. Titled THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM, it has the very unusual distinction of being extremely famous before it was widely available: originally printed in a limited edition of 120 copies, it was widely praised, but it was not given a further printing until after Lawrence's death--at which point both those who served with Lawrence and historians alike noted that the work was much less accurate, much less factual than its first readers supposed. Still, between the press coverage and the man's own gift for self-mythology, it was enough. T.E. Lawrence was enshrined in memory as Lawrence of Arabia, and in the late 1950s and early 1960s David Lean set out to make a film about him, using THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM as primary source.A great deal has been made of the film's factual inaccuracies; a great deal more has been made of the film's failure to explicitly portray Lawrence's covertly sadomasochistic personality and homo-erotic edge. But LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is not a film of mere fact; we must turn to documentary for that. It is the myth, a vision of Lawrence as he himself wished to be seen, and the covert indications of his hidden nature adds greater depth to both his character and the film as a whole: as the story progresses we become acutely aware that there is much more that we do not know, a fact that lends a tremendous sense of mystery to the film. Factual, no; explicit, no. But in its entirety, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA achieves an artistic truth that transcends any mere notation of fact pure and simple.It is, in my opinion, the single finest film of epic scope to ever reach the screen. The episodic story, scripted by Robert Bolt (author of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS), casts a remarkably wide net, not only following Lawrence's adventures but placing them within a finely drawn context of diplomacy as well. The cast is superb. Led by Peter O'Toole in the title role, virtually every actor involved not only brings the various historical figures to vivid life, but transmutes them into archetypes as well. David Lean's direction is flawless, as is the astonishingly beautiful cinematography, artful yet unobtrusive editing, and truly memorable score.It is true that LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is best seen on the big screen, where its visual power may be seen a full power; even so, it fares remarkably well on the small screen, much more so than epics that rely on visual power to the exclusion of all else. There have been several releases to the home market, including a double cassette VHS and a two disk DVD with a host of extras; the single DVD release, a ""no frills"" release without significant extras, also offers a near-pristine picture and excellent sound. If you are interested in purchasing the film, make certain that you are not buying a pan-and-scan version, for these very significantly undercut the beauty of the film.Alternatively languid and violent, beautiful and disquieting, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is a remarkably fine film that deserves every praise heaped upon it since its 1962 release. I cannot recommend it too highly.Gary Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Lawrence of Arabia
104,rupie,a memento from the days when they made real movies,9,15 June 1999,"It is, in a way, depressing to watch this movie today. One winds up contrasting it with the sort of technologically slick and aesthetically shallow spectacles, like ""Titanic"", that garner the sort of adulation that a truly great movie like ""Lawrence"" received in its day, and one realizes how far we have fallen.Ignore David Lean's painterly technique, the way he fills the screen like a canvas. Ignore Freddie Young's stunning cinematography in fulfillment of Lean's vision. Ignore the fabulous score by Maurice Jarre. Ignore the stupendous cast. Ignore the topnotch script.What we have, beyond all this, is an absolutely gripping and psychologically perplexing character study of a uniquely enigmatic individual that keeps us on the edge of our seats for the full length of the movie. ""Lawrence"", at over 200 minutes, goes by faster than many a movie of half its length, due to Lean's brilliant pacing and direction, and superb acting all around. To make a comparison in the world of music, this movie, like Mahler's 8th symphony, is a universe contained within itself.Of course, it is an exercise in self-denial and philistinism to watch this movie in anything other than the wide-screen - or ""letterbox"" - format, due to Lean's complete use of every inch of the wide screen.

Lawrence's (Peter O'Toole) adventures and life with the Arabs, and the inspiration help he offered them in resisting the Turks, told in flashbacks after his accidental death in the 1930s.Lawrence Of Arabia is a sprawling epic that does full justice to its contradictory, remarkably complex hero. It's a triumph of large-scale film-making that demonstrates brain as well as budget. O'Toole is mesmerising in the title role, though the relative newcomer Omar Sharif also rose to the occasion magnificently; it's a sign of this film's power that Sharif's first entrance on screen - a long, long fixed shot as he approaches across the hot, shimmering sands, not only holds the audience's attention but is actively spell-binding.

Seldom in my movie-going experience I have been as thrilled by a character entrance as by Sheriff Ali's, still a black dot on the horizon as he shoots a man for the water of a well; as disturbed as by the nightmarish scene in Daraa and its implied horror; as betrayed as by the transmogrification of Alec Guinness' Prince Feisal from soft-spoken paternal figure to shrewd, manipulative politician; as exhilarated by cinematic craft as by the cut from the match to the rising sun, or the panning shot of the assault on Aqaba.Epic at its finest: when Lawrence steps on a puddle and smiles as he appears to be walking on water, it tells us more about him than a whole hour of exposition would.A vital, timeless masterpiece.10/10",Lawrence of Arabia
108,gab-14712,One of All Time's Best Epics!,9,10 January 2016,"Over the course of six decades, Lawrence of Arabia have been given names such as ""the epic of all epics."" People always mention this film when talking about influential movies or favorite movies. In fact, this film gave way to famous directors such as Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and Martin Scorsese. These fore-mentioned directors based their films off the style of this film. No one knew it in 1962, but this film would be one of the most influential films of all time. Believe it or not, I actually didn't think too much of the film the first time I saw it. I thought it was overlong and boring. I must have been in a bad mood that day, because I simply loved the film upon my second viewing. The scope of the film is incredible and I love the lush, gorgeous cinematography. The film is sweepingly beautiful and I still love seeing the shots of the desert sun. Everything in the film has a gentle beauty to it, even the violent battles featured in the film, so it's no surprise the film won an Oscar for its cinematography.The film itself is based off the historical adventures of T.E Lawrence. The movie begins with Lawrence's death at the age of 46 due to a motorcycle accident. Then it flashbacks to 1916 with Lawrence as a young intelligence officer stationed in Cairo, Egypt. Around this time, the Arabs began a revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Turkey. Lawrence is given leave to investigate the revolt. However, he creates an army on the side of the Arabs and he uses his army to fight against the slowly-weakening Turkish troops.Despite many people loving this spectacle, this film had its share of controversies. Mostly in the way of historical inaccuracies. For example, the Lawrence depicted in this film does not resemble the Lawrence of reality. The Lawrence in the movie, portrayed by Peter O'Toole, is taller, skinnier, has a very boyish face, and speaks in a sarcastic way. His mannerisms also are different, and the story goes that Lawrence's family found the film to be stupid and that it insults the memory of Lawrence. Also, new characters were introduced such as Sheriff Ali, who was a Arab soldier fighting alongside Lawrence in the movie. Other notable differences were in the movie, Prince Faisal, the Arab leader was depicted as a middle-age man when in reality he was barely 30 years old. Also, General Allenby, the boss of Lawrence, was depicted as cold and mean to Lawrence. But there is enough evidence to prove they actually may have been good friends in real life. Also there have been complaints that not all of Lawrence's exploits were mentioned in the film.Now what is my response to all these controversies? I think it's a load of bull. I am always for one for filmmakers to try to make their movie accurate as possible. But the bottom line is that the purpose of a movie is to entertain. If that means a film has some inaccuracies, so be it. If I needed to learn about a topic, I would watch a documentary. That being said, movies are always a good starting point to learn about a particular subject (in this case, T.E Lawrence).This film was directed by David Lean, a master when it comes to epics. We have already seen his 1957 feature, Bridge on the River Kwai. This film is his follow-up to Kwai's success, and it's interesting because this film is even more successful, critically and financially. Lean is an excellent director, although he is known for his old-fashioned methods and clashing with his actors on set. There is no denying he created a powerful, influential film. He created a straightforward narrative on the outside, but he raises complex questions on the inside.The performances are all wonderful. Peter O'Toole, although boyish-looking and does not resemble the real Lawrence much, does an amazing job. he does bring to life the eccentric ways of Lawrence. A powerful scene he brought to life is after a rather suicidal trek across the scorching desert, he goes back to help a fallen comrade and bring him to safety. Omar Sharif, a major star in Egypt, does an exceptional job as Sheriff Ali. I bet if you didn't see the cast list, you would have never recognized Alec Guinness. I wouldn't blame you if you didn't because he does an exceptional job as Prince Faisal, the calm leader of the Arabs. Guinness was very immersed in his character, which isn't surprising because he always gives his very best. Jack Hawkins does a good job as the manipulative commander in General Allenby. The whole cast does a great job; Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, Arthur Kennedy as the American reporter who turns the exploits of Lawrence into a myth, and Anthony Quayle as Colonel Brighton.It's a wonder that Lawrence of Arabia was ever made. It was a 216-minute movie plus intermission. It was a film that had no love story (or women for that matter), not a lot of action, and was filmed in the desert. Usually, the big man with the money would have refused, but this film was given a chance and it was quite a chance to take. People adored this film from its release all the way to today. The performances and the cinematography are always singled out. I personally must single out the score by Maurice Jarre. He composed an incredible piece of music, and it's one of my top soundtracks ever. The film won 7 Oscars, including the well-deserved best picture. It's a beautiful film about an eccentric man who did a lot to help his country and to help developing nations. There are battle scenes, but the film is not about the action. It's about T.E Lawrence.My Grade: A",Lawrence of Arabia

And despite time passed, my opinion is still the same. This is truly one of the best epic movies of all time, thanks to great acting, great cinematography (that it makes you feel like if you are in the desert) and great soundtrack.The movie is focused about Thomas Edward Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), an English Army officer who united the Arab tribes during World War 1 for fighting against the Turks. Alongside O'Toole there is a great all-star cast as the various different politicians and arabs of that period: Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif are very convincing as the Arabs Prince Faisal, Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Ali. Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Josè Ferrer, Anthony Quayle are all good as the political figures that Lawrence meets in his period of time. Also Arthur Kennedy and Donald Wolfit as the journalists give good support.Since there are already more than 660 reviews to date and everything good about this movie has already been said, I'll end it here.",Lawrence of Arabia

114,gelman@attglobal.net,Quintessential David Lean,10,25 February 2005,"Based just on ""Lawrence,"" ""Zhivago,"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai,"" David Lean must certainly be counted among the greatest directors ever. And, while Peter O'Toole and the other fine actors in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn, Jose Ferrer among them) help make this a great picture, this film -- more than the others -- belongs to Lean himself. The scenes in the desert, the panoramic camera shots, the unhurried pace of the action are knock-your-socks-off brilliant. In fact, I'm hard put to think of another movie that rivals ""Lawrence"" in this respect. As someone else has remarked, this is a film that needs to be seen in a theater. The small screen can't begin to do it justice. I'm inclined to doubt that a giant TV screen (which I do not possess) will do the job. This is a BIG picture in every respect. A great picture in every way imaginable. In celebrating Lean's contribution, I don't mean to slight the acting which is superb. Peter O'Toole deserves all the superlatives that have been lavished on him. Guiness is Guiness, one of the finest actors of his generation. And enough can't be said about Anthony Quinn. Quinn does unlettered, vital,virile and larger than life better than anyone else ever has. I'd have to think very closely about some of his other performances, but this may very well be Quinn's best.",Lawrence of Arabia
115,Pedro_H,The nearest thing to a perfect action film yet made.,10,11 January 2004,"Circa World War One a low ranking British officer somehow manages to unite the rival tribes of Arabia to drive the Turks out of their yet unmapped country.Whether you like the work of David Lean or not you cannot begrudge him his chapter in cinema history. And note I said chapter and not page. While any review of a film is personal and depends on such factors as ""getting involved with the characters"" you have to admire this for guts and determination alone.Scenes from this film go beyond the word epic, you feel that you are watching a documentary with no corner cut or no cost saved. Like all the great films you feel that you have gone through the experience rather than merely watched it. While O'Tool became an instant world star, plenty of respect goes to the mostly British support cast. There isn't a bad casting here everyone is perfect for their roles (bar Alec Guinness who is merely ok) and is giving it their all. If there is bum note or bad performance anywhere I didn't see it and special praise for Omar Sharif, his support work here is pin-sharp and perfect.The battle scenes are nothing less than some of the most perfectly realised pieces of cinema ever created. Quite frightening descends in to a world of carnage and madness that few of us - thankfully - will go for real.
There has to be a whole generation of people that have never seen it on the big screen and quite a number that have never seen the film full stop. Every city in the world should show this film in its full restored version to show what cinema can be when it gets it all totally right. It is one hell of an experience.What makes it all more amazing is that it manages to be both literate and insightful - especially in regards to how  much easier it is to unite on the battlefield than it is in the conference chamber. That self-determination is only possible if you wish to have self-determination and not let stupidity and anarchy rule. And more importantly, the lesson that has still to be learned: that the third world cannot be run by first world rules.This is David Leans best film by some way, it is almost frightening in the way that everything works and fits together. It has to soft peddle some of the imagery to get a family friendly certificate and the language might be a bit a lot milder than that used, but this has enough truth and truths to be used a history lesson - if you remember that all tellings of history are loaded and that includes important and respected history books.",Lawrence of Arabia
116,rebeljenn,Visually magnificent,7,21 January 2006,"The strongest element of this film is the camera's capture of the landscapes and the detail that was put into the visual elements of the film. By proportions, this film is an epic and certainly in a league of its own, similar to the title character himself. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a film about an English soldier who helps the Arabs fight the Turks in the 1940s because he has a strong love for their culture and country. The film follows this man and how he influences others around him. The only downfall of this film is that it is often difficult to follow the story and to understand exactly the different players and reasoning behind some of their actions. (However, I do not think that this is a fault in the acting but probably a fault in the script.)

As the film develops we see him gaining legendary status amongst his band of Arabian fighters.The casting, location photography and music score are a delight.

This movie is sort of a collection of intriguing questions, which follow a man and his legend.A man is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service a reporter tries, with little success, to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him. The story then moves backward to the First World War where one British Army lieutenant is noted for his education and reverie. His generals sends him to assess the prospects of an Arabian prince in his revolt against the Turks. The lieutenant is quite intelligent and eloquent piques the prince's interest. He proposes to the prince a daring surprise attack on Aqaba. Its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. He convinces the prince to provide fifty men, led by a skeptical Sheriff. He managed to unite two warring Arab tribes and the next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish garrison. However, political interests have always been dirty ...One, to some extent, kind idea by an able-bodied man is lost in desert conflicts and political fraud. The main protagonist is beating a harsh battle with the world and himself at the same time. It is difficult to draw the line between his ambitions and his disappointments. A winning spirit has become a sadistic brake of the despair. Does war and politics destroy the man and his ideals?!The open landscapes, soundtrack, exotic and epic atmosphere bring magic with this film. A glorious adventure is based on the somewhat clumsy conflicts, in which all the beauty and brutality of a country is in contrast to the human spirit. That is a game in which one character is searching for his identity. A mystical plot, which initiates the main protagonist, is the greatest asset of this film.Peter O'Toole as T. E. Lawrence is confused and fascinating character at the same time. He is a capable, organized, brisk, disinterested and disappointed man at the end. He is a hero and a loser, a winner and a tragic, a leader and a political pawn, a believer and a sadist. A transience is the essence of this film. Mr. O'Toole has offered a magnificent performance.His support are Omar Sharif (Sherif Ali) is like a desert tiger"", who wants to learn from ""his friend"" a new philosophy of life. An incredible chemistry has developed between him and the main actor in this film. Anthony Quinn (Auda abu Tayi) is something between a rebel and mercenary. A theatrical character, who, regardless of the tradition, doing what he pleases. Alec Guinness (Prince Faisal) is a very tricky character. Jack Hawkins (General Allenby) and Claude Rains (Mr. Dryden) are the embodiment of a political obscenity.This long experience will not leave anyone indifferent.

119,esteban1747,The hero of Arabia?,8,17 November 2003,"I do not know whether the story of the film is true. Knowing the Arab people it is difficult to believe this plot, however, it is an extraordinary film about a person with his own personality, pride, willingness and intense feelings of love and hate. Peter O'Toole made his debut in this classic in an extraordinary way; his acting was excellent jointly with those of Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness and Omar Sharif. One of the best things the film revealed was the intention of French and British to occupy the whole Arab area occupied by Turkey once the first world war would have been over, and it happened in that way. Syria and Lebanon went for France while the rest remained in British possession. The film also illustrates that this whole area was Arab with several tribes without any concept of nationality, and there were no borders between the present territories of Jordan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and others. The borders were invented artificially later with the western occupation creating tiny nations, so you may guess why. Various historical and cultural ingredients make this film interesting. I must acknowledge that at certain point of the film I saw this Lawrence as a kind of Tarzan in the Arab world, but I do not know whether the story is a real one and if this Lt. Lawrence existed.",Lawrence of Arabia

As an anthropologist who worked with camel and cattle Bedouins for many years in Africa and the Middle East, I can only say the films captures much of the intrigue and paradox that makes up these fascinating people.  Er Lawrence (as he preferred to be called) was likewise paradoxical, mercurial and contradictory.  The film is just a masterpiece of cinematography and storyline.  The myth of this amazing man comes to life in more ways than one.  There are dozens of historical treatments on the Arabian campaign (called the ""Revolt in the Desert"" by Lawrence) and even more biographies of TE Lawrence, later AKA Shaw.  None of them answer the questions that persist to intrigue us and perhaps, as the years slid by, we'll never know the true face behind the mask of a man, who on the outside surface was shy, retiring and self-effacing and at the same time who through his correspondence with such great lights as GB Shaw became a political gadfly.  The film bring all of these points to bear leaving us with the same questions asked in the opening scenes of Lawrence/Shaw's funeral, ""Who was he?""",Lawrence of Arabia
121,AhmedSpielberg99,"If there is only one film deserves to be described as Epic, it's Lawrence of Arabia!",9,21 February 2019,"First and foremost, this movie has way more humor than I ever thought it would have. From its very beginning, I was quite surprised by the amount of humor I found, not only because I didn't expect so, but also because it often works pretty well!Another great surprise I had watching this movie is that I didn't find it boring at all despite its nearly four-hours runtime. A long runtime alone doesn't make a movie bad or weak, but it certainly doesn't help. But I really think there is almost no second that David Lean has wasted in this textbook example of epic cinema. It's quite entertaining for plenty of reasons; two of them are the fascinating cinematography that treated my eyes with some of the most jaw-dropping images I've ever seen been captured on film, and the mind-bogglingly masterful editing that is easily also one of the best I've ever seen in film.Lawrence of Arabia is also surprisingly very simple despite its fiendishly complex portrait of the titular character. Actually it may be sometimes too simple for its own good, for I think the movie became superficial and shallow at the beginning of its second half for the sake of nothing but developing the character of Lawrence. There are some key events that should have been more focused on, but ended up being demonstrated comparatively quite fast and superficially. That made the second half a bit muddled, unlike the unbelievably perfect first half, but this wasn't much of an issue for me; because David Lean really make up for this simplicity by delivering a disturbing, terrifying, opulent, astute and utterly unique psychological profile of a heroic, yet flawed historical figure that is the protagonist, Lawrence. As for Peter O'Toole's performance, the only thing I could say is that I was quite mad for about the first half of the movie because how inaccurately serious-looking he appeared on the poster of the movie despite the fact he was rather good-natured, and looked quite charming. Of course, I realized that I was embarrassingly wrong when O'Toole gradually changed 100 percent to a very serious, and even seemingly mad man who struggles to find a balance in his life,nay, to discover his identity.I also want to say that I'm so so proud of Omar Sharif, who brought one of the most iconic secondary characters in the history of cinema! Alec Guinness was also terrific as Prince Faisal, although I still think he delivered his best performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai, another epic from Lean. Auda Abu Tayi is one of the most blatantly greedy characters I've seen in film, and it could have never been portrayed so convincingly by other than the great actor, Anthony Quinn.(9/10)",Lawrence of Arabia

The movie follows the life of T. E. Lawrence. The conflict that T. E. Lawrence experiences during his support of the Arab uprising against the Ottoman Empire is in full view across this 180 minute epic.The movie centers around T. E. Lawrence. This movie follows T. E. Lawrence from his beginnings as a British lieutenant in The Great War. He embarks on a journey to the Arab world to aid in the uprising against the Ottoman Empire. The movie covers his entire journey in the Arab world from his beginnings to the completion of the rebellion. The movie utilizes the long time the movie has with the audience incredibly well. The movie absolutely benefits from the 180+ minutes of running time to establish characters that T. E. Lawrence interacts with characters such as Prince Faisal that are strong characters in their own way.There are two parts to the movie that should be mentioned. The first part of the movie details the rise of T. E. Lawrence in the Arab world and his assistance with the revolt. The second part of the movie details the winding down of the revolt and the eventual end of the war. Both of the parts have their own themes and it is nice to see the distinction between the two parts. The second part in particular has T. E. Lawrence become a new character as the result of his torture by the Ottomans. There is a brutal satisfaction that the audience sees in the conclusion of the movie.This movie is incredibly beautiful. The sets, and shots are incredibly well done. The audience can feel that they are in the desert looking at the authenticity that the movie brings. This movie has incredibly high production values and it holds up even today. Although the movie does not have modern filmmaking techniques, this was not a hindrance to the movie at all.

128,Eumenides_0,Cinema Reaches Its Zenith,10,14 February 2010,"David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia stands, for me at least, as the greatest movie ever made. I wouldn't say it's my favourite – that title goes to Roman Polanski's Chinatown – but objectively I cannot conceive any movie superior, either on technical or acting matters. It's one of the few perfect movies I know. It's also one of the movies I'd gladly pay money to see on a big screen.Using the life story of T.E. Lawrence, Lean, and his masterful screenwriter, Robert Bolt, create an epic movie about a British officer fighting in Arabia during World War I, who becomes a legend in his own time, the man known as Lawrence of Arabia.The movie shows Lawrence befriending the Arabs, organising them in an army, leading a successful terror campaign against the Turks, becoming intoxicated with his own power and attempting to create an Arab state that would be free of any British influence.Unlike the mediocre biopics that today merely illustrate a life, without any artistic flair, Lean and Bolt's masterwork celebrates the enigma that was Lawrence: they show him as an apparently mediocre officer who surprised everyone by becoming a master strategist; an officer loathed by his superiors and admired by the Arabs; a man very close to treason in his ambition to create an Arab State, going against all the political aspirations foreign interests had for that area; a poet who hid a sadistic streak. Nothing is simple in this many-faced man's life. Just compare the complexity of this figure with the treatment Nelson Mandela gets in Invictus, for instance, to use one modern biopic. In less than 10 minutes Mandela is explained, he holds no mysteries, all the complexity of his existence was reworked for mass consumption. At the end of 200 minutes, people will continue to scratch their heads trying to make sense of Lawrence of Arabia's personality.As Lean develops the enigma that is Lawrence, he simultaneously rewards the viewer with some of the film-making ever. Ever shot is delicately composed, his camera captures the majesty and dread of the still desert, his characters are but ants in the wide canvases that he paints. One aspect of Lawrence personality that is much explored is his sense of superiority, and I can't think of a better way of ridiculing this than showing Lawrence as an insect on screen.Lawrence of Arabia gathers an envious cast of actors: a young Peter O'Toole, who dazzled the world with his performance; Omar Sharif, who plays a friend, or the closest thing Lawrence can have to a friend; Anthony Quinn as an Arab tribe leader; Alec Guiness as Prince Feisal; Claude Rains playing a man who represents British interests in Arabia; and Jack Hawkins as the manipulative General Allenby. There are other great roles for Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quayle and Arthur Kennedy too. I may as well name every actor since I can't think of anyone who was bad in this movie.The relationships between all these characters have provided some of the finest meditations on human nature and its complexity. There's nothing simple about these men: they're experienced citizens of the world, each one with his private interests that go from nationalism to political power to delusions of grandeur. Nobility, heroism, treason, ruthlessness, friendship are so pure, so serious in this movie that I have to go back to Homer to find an equal treatment of these topics in art. There's none of the self-consciousness that poisons so much modern art in this movie. The characters represent these ideas entirely without hesitation.Completing the perfection of this movie is Maurice Jarre's unforgettable score, a score so unique when one hears it one immediately knows its source. Jarre composed some of the bests scores for cinema working with David Lean, and Lawrence of Arabia is perhaps his greatest achievement. Like all else in the movie, it's perfection.",Lawrence of Arabia

And so much stuff has blown up since 1962 that any film from that era looks a little soft (""Rear Window"") compared to modern thrillers. And I don't like dramas or films that are overly arty. It isn't that I disrespect film school types. Rather, I lack the sophistication to appreciate, for example, the sets or choreography if the plot is stupid and the characters unlikeable (""The Piano""). And dramas are often too slow-paced and full of sappy melodrama (""Forrest Gump"").However, ""Lawrence of Arabia"", which contains a whole lotta arty, was accessible to me. What an incredible adventure story, and of course it's based on a true story. I got a real hoot out of seeing Alec Guinness in a real role (not ""Star Wars""), and Peter O'Toole is spectacular. Right after I saw the film I saw ""Dune"" on TV, you know, the science fiction novel and subsequent movie(s), and I realized -- Dune was based on Lawrence of Arabia!

130,oOoBarracuda,Lawrence of Arabia,10,25 April 2016,"David Lean's 1962 Best Picture Academy Award winning film, Lawrence of Arabia leans on Lean's inventiveness as a filmmaker. The film clocks in at just under 4-hours and relies wholly on the concept of developing Peter O'Toole's titular character. Joining O'Toole are notable actors Alec Guinness and Omar Sharif to tell the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who sought to go into the desert to unify the divided Arab tribes to fight the Turks in WWI. Lawrence took the burden of unification onto his shoulders voluntarily, believing he could be a great force for unity; Lean's portrayal of Lawrence's story is nothing short of an artful masterpiece.This film captured my heart from the opening scene. A backward narrative always pulls me in, and can almost guarantee that I'll be engaged through the entire film. We learn of Lawrence's fate with the opening scene, then, we are shown his life and his various unexpected accomplishments. a multi-faceted, somewhat difficult English officer T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) who seeks to go into the desert and further the English ambition against the Turks. The only problem was, as much as Lawrence was revered for his mind, he was chastised for his tongue. Lawrence was no rank and file soldier; he often mouthed off to high command and never abandoned his own principles. Lawrence just might be crazy enough to make this work, was the consensus of the high command as they sent him to deserts of the Middle East. After overcoming a rocky start, Lawrence made friends along his travels, eventually earning the respect of Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) who holds great power in the Middle Eastern deserts. After much intricate maneuvering, Lawrence eventually brings together the divided Arab tribes against the common enemy, the Turks; all the while furthering the English position against the Turks. Lawrence is the most unlikely hero, yet his idiosyncrasies suited him perfectly for the task at hand.The absolute highlight of this magnificent film is the incredible acting prowess of Peter O'Toole. O'Toole completely mastered the piercing stare, the jaunty walk, and the effeminate mannerisms consistently noted characteristics of T.E. Lawrence. O'Toole was a master as the awkward, undaunted British officer; well worth the top spot on Premiere Magazine's list of 100 Greatest Movie Performances of All Time. This was the first role of O'Toole's I have ever seen and I can't wait to take in more of this great actor's work. This film also has some of the best cinematography I have ever seen. Shot in real life deserts, Lean spared no expense bringing the toils of Lawrence to life. The stark realism brought about by the rigorous shooting schedule and intense commitment from David Lean have entrenched Lawrence of Arabia as a classic for audiences of all ages. Another standout from this film is the incredible soundtrack. The music transforms the audience from their couch to atop a camel bringing the travels of Lawrence to a relatable level. The magic of the music and the acting and the beautiful shots come together to gift the audience with a glamorous spectacle to enjoy again and again. Do yourself a favor, and watch Lawrence of Arabia, at least once.",Lawrence of Arabia
131,braddugg,An epic film that deserves an epic viewing.,10,2 July 2014,"An epic film that deserves an epic viewing.A film that's 228 minutes that is 3 hours and 48 minutes longs should have been exhausting. But this one is endearing and thus deservedly has been one of the greatest films ever made. To understand this film and appreciate it more than just the film, one would better be acquainted with the history. It has a great history behind the story. Though, there are few factual manipulations to include more drama, the whole experience of viewing this, is rewarding. It's rewarding to know that such a person existed who fought a war merely on the basis of humanity. He was completely impartial and non-judgmental. This was based on World War 1, now when we compare to films made on World War 1, with those made about World War 2, I found that they are very few in number. But this one stands above all other films that are based on World War 2. David Lean, the master behind the making of this film, shows his efforts in every frame of it. Indeed, he builds a whole world for the camera and it has great beauty in each shot. Each angle, each move is just so detailed and precise that it's tough to find fault in any frame. From the sun rise in the Arabian desert to the landscapes filled with sand dunes. From battles to closed door discussions, there is a certain magnanimity to each frame. The grandeur can be attributed partly to the choice of shooting of the film 70mm cinema scope (Super Panavision 70). For me the greatness would go to the director David Lean and to the cinematographer F A Young. Peter O Toole perhaps, was remembered as Lawrence more than his own name. Such was the impact of his character and his depiction was pitch perfect in every aspect. Peter showcased equanimity while there was war being shown, or while grappling with his own emotional internal conflict. War is brutal but more brutal is the war within. In a war of arms, you are killed for once. But in an emotional war, each moment is deathly. Peter showcased a rare poise and I am certain the whole film experience could have been so exhausting that he would have considered it an experience of a life time that more worthy than life itself.Amongst other things, I liked the music which was given by Maurice Jarre. The music was right up there and in such a long movie, music was very much needed to keep the emotional quotient. The music had the much needed variation. Be it the English war themes, or one to amplify Arabian desert sounds or even Arabian traditional music or the pathos of Lawrence too. There was a music needed for every bit and it was there all over the place. Never I felt it was over the board or too loud, it was just right. All the actors have done a commendable job. Above all others, I loved Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal and Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali. Thanks to David Lean and the producers of this epic. It's one of the most courageous decision of all those involved in the making and thankfully it paid great dividends in terms of awards and rewards. A definite 5/5 for an epic of a film.",Lawrence of Arabia

Of course, we both had seen it when it was first released 48 years ago but to watch it again after being somnambulated by the stuff passing themselves off as movies today brings a whole new experience to movie viewing.I know that economics has forced movies to cut their extra's budget and again, it was refreshing to see real people filling the screen rather than computer magic. The 60s, 70s and 80s really was a period of renaissance in the film industry because they were not constrained by the need to film in a studio. However, what brought the renaissance to an end was the cost of making contemporary movies with all the extras and other assorted needs, in this case horses and camels. Now we have movies of cartoon characters, probably because it is cheaper to hire an animator than an actor.David Lean would not exist in today's world so I recommend that movie lovers return to the modern classics. The recolouring of the films make them totally contemporary by photography standards.",Lawrence of Arabia
137,MelbaMan1,Fascinating Character,8,14 May 2018,"Overlong and repetitive screenplay. O'Toole is charismatic. Story followed Lawrence's disillusionment with his Arab followers but he must have been equally disillusioned with the deception of the British and the French. This is referred to but Lawrence is largely left out of it and we are made to believe his disillusionment is more to do with the Arabs rather than the politicians. I think the reverse is probably truer. To see him confront those who betrayed his ideals would have given balance to the movie. The motorbike death is portrayed as an accident. I had the impression it wasn't. In all, Lawrence was probably even more fascinating than he is here. His probable homosexuality is never referred to (his masochism is hinted at). Omar Sharif matches O'Toole perfectly. Film is worth the watching for these two performances alone. (viewed 9/16)",Lawrence of Arabia

As the sun rises and as the score reaches a crescendo, the scene dissolves into a vast rolling sea of sand.  Cresting the immense dune is Lawrence and his guide, dwarfed by the desert that surrounds them.  The film goes on and continues to impress.  The raid on Aquaba, the score and the performances from Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are fresh and vibrant now as they were almost forty years ago.  This is one film that needs to be seen in a large theatre, or if one is not available, the letterboxed edition.  If you watch it in a Pan and Scan version, you will be cheating yourself from some of the best cinematography that you will ever see.",Lawrence of Arabia
139,Flagrant-Baronessa,History brilliantly set in desert-sweeping motion,10,6 January 2007,"David Lean's famously epic rumination of the titular character is a relentlessly long desert saga, but it has a destination: illustrate the hypocrisy of war and the madness of pre-world war I colonialism. It is also one of the best films I have ever seen, with a lead actor's performance that is simply ten times better than anyone else's in film history. Although the success of Lawrence rests squarely on the shoulders of the eccentric Peter O'Toole as the flamboyant British officer, the manageable script by Robert Bolt, the sweeping cinematography of the desert-laden plains by Freddie Young and the swarmingly epic score by Maruice Jarre all firmly elevate the film to classic status.Based on T.E. Lawrence's rambling, puzzling memoirs in ""The Seven Pillars of Wisdom,"" David Lean translates the man's epic journeys in Saudi Arabia to something equally mystical in the film. Lawrence of Arabia tells the story of English officer (O'Toole) who helps the divided Arab tribes to unite against the Ottoman Empire in the Great War. With his hit-and-run, guerilla-warfare tactics, military triumphs unfold in the desert-swept, dramatic landscape that no one thought possible. Through a series of audacious victories, Lawrence earns the trust, respect, and loyalty of the Arab peoples and becomes something of a hero to the world, even though it nearly drove him mad in the process, torn and conflicted between he loyalty of England and that of the ""quaint, barbaric"" Arabs. Why he wanted any of this the movie leaves up in the air.Much like the story, Peter O'Toole lets his character Lawrence unfold in mystical ways, heightening the enigma that is the officer-turned-major. He is emotionally transparent in his performance when it calls for it, such as at the height of battle or broken-down in a Turkish prison camp, but there is a perpetual impenetrable air about him that is so endlessly refreshing and interesting to behold. ""I'm different,"" he proclaims to the stiffy bureaucratic military in Cairo and shows us a man who sings, jests, philosophizes and befriends unlikely subjects in the vast desert. When given new white billowing robes by his friend Sheriff (Omar Sharif), he twirls and admires his appearance. In this way, Lawrence is both suggestive and flamboyant, fit with a plummy English accent, hinting at homosexuality, and indeed his presence is almost incongruous to the barren, plain setting. Suffice to say that O'Toole shamelessly swallows every scene he is in and aptly captures the many ever-shifting shades of Lawrence.The desert-strewn pictorial style is a definite strong suit for 'Lawrence of Arabia' as it provides juxtaposition (O'Toole's piercing blue eyes against the sandy infinity), visual stimuli and living illustrations of the vast harshness of a far-stretched Arabic desert. The first sight of Omar Sharif, initially a mere dot on the horizon, is perhaps the most striking sequence in this epic travelogue  but in all fairness these visual gems are delivered by the bucketload by cinematographer Freddie Young. There is no fancy-schmancy CGI or effects; if you want to shoot a desert sunrise you get up early and wait until it emerges. The result is unbelievably raw and sliced down to the bare essentialsdesert, desert, desert. Even the dialogue is comparatively sparse, and epic battles are only interjected when it calls for it. Its biggest accolade, as far as I am concerned, is the absence of extra-template romances or personal intrigue. That is something you do not see in films today, and I am endlessly thankful that there are no gratuitous swooning women in it.In spite of the absence of epic romances, Lawrence of Arabia is romantically poetic enough on its own. David Leans opens with 5 minutes of all score, and no visual images. Now, I have heard a lot of good scores in my days, but Maruice Jarre's hauntingly recognizable desert tunes are simply incredible. This musical component speaks volumes on the epic scale and is brilliantly scored to scenes such as the iconic 'match melting into a desert sunrise' sequence. Some would perhaps argue that the film is mostly cinematography, music and acting, but I say it touches on some highly then-salient issues, giving a curt nod to the Lawrence enigma but truly breathing life into his character and intertwining some imperial politics in the process. When Lawrence returns sweaty and dressed in rags from gruesome desert fighting and having lost men in the swallowing heat, the posh officers in the Cairo headquarters inform him on the news: ""We've built a squash court."" ""Jolly good."" Brilliant, and satirical.I could give more rambling, semi-coherent and fawning praise for 'Lawrence of Arabia', but I think I will stop here. It is certainly an experience, visually, sensory and musically and the fearsomely intense radiance of Peter O'Toole gets it far alone.10 out of 10 (I don't just throw this grade out)",Lawrence of Arabia
140,lagudafuad,They don't make them like this anymore,8,5 September 2012,"As far as classics go, Lawrence of Arabia carves a mark in the epic genre as one of the best epic movies out there.Based on the life of T. E. Lawrence, this movie depicts in full detail Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during World War I, with focus primarily on his attacks and conquest of Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council.The movie has well rooted scenes that take you through a journey of self discovery, we get to see the emotional struggles Lawrence faced and how the resulting violence caused by war can change a man completely.The desert scenes were shot in Jordan and Morocco.During filming Peter was having difficulty with the camel saddle so he bought rubber foam and placed it on the saddle, many extras copied him and it has become wide spread even till today.Later, during the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel during the charge, but fortunately, it (the camel) stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him.Many Arab countries including Jordan banned the film. Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success.Peter O'Toole who played Lawrence delivered a much awarding performance; although he didn't win the best actor role in the Oscars he was nominated.Broken into two parts each over an hour and 40 minutes long, Lawrence was a British soldier whose flamboyant attitude made him popular among his fellow colleagues, he was sent to the desert plain to see to the Arabs, and from there he made friends with the Arabs.He fought with them and led them to victory, but his loyalties come into question as he was cutting across two territories the British government and his new found love, the Arabs.The script of the movie is well plotted and the screenplay is marvelous, add to that the cinematography, the musical score and the directing.Lawrence of Arabia is a complete package, a masterpiece waiting to be seen by anyone.What I really love about the script is how we get to see Lawrence move from nothing to hero, from hero to god and from god back to man.This movie launched Peter into the limelight and the character that catches your fancy may end up being Omar Sharif who played Sheriff Ali ibn el Kharish.The movie is fun to watch, I recommend it.",Lawrence of Arabia

Many directors tried to bring the story to the screen - Lewis Milestone, Zoltan Korda, William K. Howard, and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger - with numerous stars considered for the lead, including Robert Donat, Leslie Howard, Laurence Olivier, and Cary Grant.  With a cast led by newcomer Peter O'Toole and nearly two years spent shooting in the desert, Lean emerged with a vast and compelling study of Lawrence.

142,TheExpatriate700,"Well-Photographed, Spellbinding Epic",8,15 June 2010,"Lawrence of Arabia is a beautifully filmed, old style epic describing the life and adventures of T. E. Lawrence. It succeeds on several fronts: as a character study, a rousing adventure, and a condemnation of imperialism.As a character study, Peter O'Toole is excellent as Lawrence, getting into the psyche of a complex and not always sympathetic historical figure. We see the personality traits that enabled Lawrence to achieve greatness, while also seeing how fame affected him, for both good and ill. The other performances are also good, particularly Omar Sharif and Alec Guinness.Furthermore, the film, though long, never drags. The mixture of beautiful photography of desert landscapes and epic battle scenes keeps the film engaging throughout. The evolution of O'Toole's Lawrence helps, preventing him from becoming a boring cardboard hero.Given this film's subject matter, it is open to potential accusations of Orientalism and exoticizing the Arab people. Although the film spends a lot of time on Arab culture and its differences from Western culture, its ultimate message is in opposition to imperialism. It clearly denounces the European bureaucrats who divided up the Middle East in the wake of World War I. Its condemnation is relevant not only to historical events, but also to the current Middle Eastern conflict.Ultimately, no film can substitute for a good work of historical scholarship, and those interested in Lawrence should consult a book if they want to know the full story.

We have a grandiose visual story that is written for a man who leads men into the untried and untrue. Most cast were standouts and need no further immortalizing here. I enjoyed their clear approach to their characters. But while T.E. Lawrence was certainly not Moses, as was adeptly noted by his detractors, the role certainly was one of a leader, a defiant one, but still one whom men would follow into battle. How it was cast with Peter O'Toole, and effeminate English boy trying to be noble beyond country affiliation, seems to be a contradiction of that absolute requirement. I wouldn't follow him into a bar, no less the dessert. Who does he serve? Petulance, adventure, intuition and self-righteousness. A well-spoken scholar with ideas outside of the box makes for a great strategist, not a war general. Politics are also in the same realm of books read by Lawrence, yet he was so overcome with himself that the subject of oil could not be breached? Who could be so naive to think the English would leave Arabia to the Arabs once they had it in their hands. I watched the film as a boyish fantasy, and enjoyed it as the mis-cast adventures of T.E. Lawrence",Lawrence of Arabia
146,WhimsicalVonia,Peter O'Toole's Definitive Role,9,19 December 2013,"***** As Peter O'Toole left us less than a week ago, on December 14, 2013, I believe it is necessary for me to state that he should have received Best Actor for his illustrious performance. Quite sadly, O'Toole received eight nominations for Best Actor in his career, but never won. He had many great roles after this, but this one was made for him! ***** In his most significant role, Peter O'Toole is T.E. Lawrence, the ostensibly charming, confident, and flamboyant T. E. Lawrence. At the beginning of the film, we see a naive young Lawrence, arrogant and ostentatious, bordering on pretentious and overbearing. His most prominent personality qualities (proud, charming, determined, focused, loyal, fearless), along with his uniquely extensive knowledge of Middle Eastern culture and geography, lead him to great success in his interactions with the Arabs. But, as with many great individuals, it is also these exact qualities that lead to his eventual downfall. Stationed in Cairo, he is deployed to Arabia on the counsel of Mr. Dryden from the Arab Bureau (Claude Rains), whom suggests that time in the desert may ""make a man out of him."" (This was likely an intimation to Lawrence's flamboyance and his commonly believed but unmentionable (at the time, due to societal beliefs, etc. media did not address gay/lesbian/bisexual themes) homo- erotic feelings and/or homosexuality. Interestingly, this specific detail was indeed an accurate reflection of the real T. E. Lawrence. Biographers and historians have only circumstantial evidence that Lawrence was open to the idea when most everyone else was not; he has also written in personal letters that he had never experienced sex, leading close friends to believe him to be asexual.) Even early in his Arabian adventures, Lawrence seems to believe himself to be infallible. He is fearless and insists on partaking in nearly impossible endeavors. There are countless allusions and references symbolizing him as a sort of God. Lawrence's experiences in Arabia inevitably reveal the insecurities of the great man. His own worst enemy, he blames himself for anything less than perfection. The first indication of this is after the death of two Arabians he feels responsible for. On his first report back to superiors, Lawrence explicitly expresses his hesitation with the dark side of war. Further explanation reveals that he actually liked killing Gasim. It is evident that this scares him, at least on some level. Unfortunately, General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) & Brighton (Anthony Quayle) dismiss his statements to nervousness. As the war continues, and as he kills more and more, Lawrence becomes more fearless, more vain, and more audacious. En route to Deraa, he is forced to kill the second of his friend/servants, Ferraj in mercy. This effects Lawrence, but he doesn't let it show (""Salute him for me,"" he whispers, referring to Daud). In Deraa, it is his own stupidity that causes his capture. Although Serif Ali has tried many times to provide reason, Lawrence decides to ""announce himself"" in enemy territory. Lawrence then makes a second try to leave Arabia, pleading with The General to send him home, for personal reasons. ""Personal? Are you mad?"" he asks. ""No,"" Lawrence answers, ""And if you don't mind, I'd rather not go mad. That's my reason too."" When asked what it is that he wants, Lawrence says, ""I told you. I want my ration of common humanity."" Despite his eloquent words, Lawrence in convinced to return, and his unstable state of mind is betrayed in Peter O'Toole's memorable performance in the bloody encounter at Tafa. Lawrence runs, then staggers, around the field, killing without hesitation, a crazed, delusional look in his eyes, yelling, ""No prisoners!"" Covered in blood, first utilizing his sword, then his gun (note that none of the Arabians had artillery), he shows no awareness, even when Serif Ali yells, ""Enough! Enough! Lawrence, Enough!"" In the aftermath, it cannot be denied: The once great Lawrence Of Arabia has become corrupted and hateful. Nevertheless, they continue on to Damascus and successfully conquer it for The British and Arabs. The Arabs, however, continue their disagreements, foregoing their chance at liberation. Lawrence finally realizes that he will be unable to see the Arabs make peace with each other. He is promoted one last time and send home, an empty, lost look in his eyes. In the last scene, as he is being escorted back to Britain, he observes several Arabs on their camels, dressed in their usual robe attire, as he rides in the passenger seat, fully dressed in his military uniform, a forlorn expression betraying the internal struggle implied throughout the film, his search for identity, what he wants in life, and his unsure allegiance to either his new found friends in the desert or his home country. Another character study illustrated through wartime decisions. However, unlike others, this worked. Enchanting and compelling story aside, the technical merit in this film was more than impressive, with its creative cinematography, a magnificent score, and accomplished performances. The title track is familiar to most individuals today, even to those whom have yet to see it. A few scenes that were especially commendable in cinematography were: the cut from Lawrence blowing out the match flame to the sun-kissed Arabian desert sky; the mirage entrance of Serif Ali; Lawrence's mystical entrance at The Prince's tent; Lawrence's lone camel skimming the beach at Aqava,against the backdrop of a beautiful, multi- colored sunset; the appearance on an impressive ocean liner in the middle of valleys of desert sand, revealing the deep blue waters of The Suez Canal.

""It's boring""; ""It's old""; ""It's not violent enough."" Well, I have a message for those people: What movie are you watching?While I cannot deny that LOA is old, it is only boring if you're watching it in slow-motion. A 220+ running time may frighten a lot of people, but LOA apologizes for its bottom-testing quality almost immediately by displaying in that long period of time an epic that someone could actually get involved in. It does that with its cinematography (which mere words cannot describe), its striking music score, and its staggeringly good performances from every actor.And if you think it's not violent enough, maybe you should go back to watching Tarantino flicks. Violence abounds in this movie, and it is some of the best-handled in cinema history. It's a shame Peter O'Toole didn't win an Oscar for this movie, but its haul on awards night did suffice.Most of you are probably expecting this review to come from a 50-year-old art-film devotee, but I'm under 20, love movies like ""Rocky Horror,"" and have loved this one just as much or even more since I was 10 or 11 years old.",Lawrence of Arabia

Each stroke, colour, action, is perfect. I will watch this film every few years, and have no problem sitting through the 3 hour plus running time. I've had the pleasure of seeing this on the big screen a couple times in my life. More recently I viewed it in HD, and it looked incredible. For such a long film, there is breathtaking set piece after set piece of huge scenes that truly define what an Epic Movie is. And you would think a long running time means a slowly paced story, but the different chapters in this film vary in pacing based on the momentum of the scene.There are scenes of thousands of people stretched across the desert vistas that are almost impossible to believe there are no visual effects involved. The grand staging of scenes in large rooms with a lush colours are a marvel to witness. Striking visuals come one after another; a large boat seemingly sailing in the desert, large cityscapes with period detail, sweeping battle scenes, and train wrecks.The list of iconic actors is also astonishing. The debut of Peter O'Toole as Lawrence is mesmerising. Alec Guinness provides an elder's wisdom. Omar Shariff and Anthony Quinn are larger than life characters. There are no missteps and endlessly breathtaking photography. One thing that comes from repeated viewings is David Lean's careful poetic presentation of the story, which is part of the secret of it's longevity.

What more can you say about this classic?For starters, forget about its age, the awards, the reputation, none of it matters when the film starts unfolding before your eyes: this is an amazingly enduring film, one that did not aspire to art but became it nonetheless. What we have before us, is the finest that the golden age of craftsmanship in cinema had to offer.Boil it down to the essentials, and Lawrence of Arabia is a Swiss-watch of a movie: all the components - a subversive script by garlanded playwright Robert Bolt, legendary cinematography by Freddie Young, and a cast to die for led by star-in- the-making Peter O'Toole - work together in perfect unison. Of all his films it is the one that most betrays David Lean's beginnings as one of the best film editors around, judging perfectly as he does not only what to show, but also what need only be alluded to or hinted at.Its intimidating running time of over 3 hours flies by thanks to a perfectly judged pacing, and expert handling of an incredible story. It also makes a mockery of the naive reputation of classical epics by managing to fit in such broad themes as colonial oppression, the dangers and virtues of terrorism/guerrilla fighting, cultural identity and sexual repression. Not what you'd expect from a desert-bound war epic...And yet, on one point they are all right, one you cannot emphasize enough. This film is big. It is huge, and frighteningly nimble and agile for its size. It is gigantic in ways contemporary films with their reliance on CGI can only dream of, and it has the virtue of knowing exactly when to deploy the full extent of its grandeur and when to hold back: there's the invasion of the port city of Akaba, handled in one single, audacious panning shot, or the scenes of one of Lawrence's doomed riderless companions racing against the rising sun. Then there are the charging hordes as Arab forces regroup in Waadi Rum. It's more awe-inspiring and immersive than anything legions of pixel-pushers can conjure up today.In closing, to re-heat another old chestnut: ""they don't make them like this anymore"". Because they can't. Nobody in their right mind would undergo the financial risk and logistical nightmare it was to put this on the screen, and gathering the caliber of talent assembled here is the kind of miracle you can't so easily repeat. See it, and do so on the biggest screen you can find!",Lawrence of Arabia

152,XxEthanHuntxX,A long lastning work of art,8,4 April 2020,"Just spent almost 4 hours watching Lawrance of Arabia and not really know what to think about it. I rarely watch ""old"" films, if so to speak, and I usally dont like them. Dont know what is the cause of it, Its something about the storyline which I believe sometimes can be very confusing and unclear, and If Im being honest Lawrance of Arabia had some moments of confusing, which I of course didnt like because I enjoy to keep up with the film so I dont miss out on something. This was primarly tords the end of the film. And with The very complex main character, Lawrance, which I at sometimes didnt understand his thinking, and he seems very special but an intresting man.But the things I did understand and kept up with was first of all a great storyline, with many cool and beurifull views and shots of nature, buildings, People, etc. It had many cool places like Sevilla and other beutiful halls and buildings, and also for example The palm trees and the rivers. And because of the films length I can only guess that the person who wrote it had quite a story to tell, and im glad The made it so long because If not, it would have been an intererly different film. The film had many ""quite"" scenes and which dont have a bunch of telling, which I guess many old films have. But I kind of like it because then you can reflect and think about what had happend.The film take place in Arabia under the first world war and I think the film looks very much like that time with the clothes, buildings and peoples behavior and talking. And having the film being pretty old in itself is very intresting to say the least. With The film having a really good showing of both english culture and mid-eastern culture.So I am not really sure what to give this because Im very confused. But I love that its so long and again the suroundings of nature and buildings, different culture, different People, etc. So will give it an eight dont think it deserves more than that but maybe my opinion change whem I get older.",Lawrence of Arabia
153,jackasstrange,Amazing!,9,22 April 2014,"Simply amazing and breath-taking. This is really a great epic and lives up to its expectations. Is not perfect and there are few things who will bother the modern viewer (dated sets and lightning use are very noticeable at times) and also, the sound editing and the mixing in general is very meh and cheesy. Limitations of the time, I understand.But overall, the acting, cinematography, editing and the story are all around great. All great. Some reviewers at the time criticized the lack of depth, but its barely noticeable frankly. The story is more about honor and spiritual conflicts rather than a conspiracy thriller, or whatever these critics meant by depth.The way it glorified the war, however, is what will hold some viewers back, me included. Some would say its the equivalent of the birth of a nation for anti-war defenders.",Lawrence of Arabia
154,zeekwunlau,Self-identity,8,27 April 2020,"The opening chapter begins with the death of Lawrence. It makes sense to make his death an opening chapter. A hero always starts with his death. The bronze statue of Lawrence was placed in St. Paul's Cathedral, and his deeds also began with this bronze statue.The beginning of the film explained the background of the big war: the Arab tribe Bedouin attacked the Turkish fortress, and a war was about to begin. When Lawrence received this news, there was a classic picture-Lawrence extinguished the match with his bare hands. This picture has an indelible effect on the entire film and the personality traits of Lawrence. When William Porter asked about the mystery, Lawrence replied: ""The secret is not to care about pain.""Lawrence is such a person who doesn't care about the pain. At that time, another officer, Mike George Berhart, said to Lawrence, ""You will always be in trouble once, but only flesh and blood."" Yes, looking at the whole movie Lawrence wanted to join the racial independence and national independence of Arabia as an ordinary person. He doesn't care about the pain, he has the will to fight and lead the people to win the war, but he is always an ordinary person. All of his composition is nothing but flesh and blood. He will always be in trouble. The ""outbreak"" mentioned here may be what Lawrence called ""outbreak"" as a historical tragedy.Then let's take a closer look at the embodiment of the tragedy of Lawrence in the whole movie. What I want to say most is the part of death and self-identification. Of course, the entire film as an epic work also talked about politics, survival, ethnicity and even some gay themes. But I will focus on the few deaths of Lawrence's experience and the destruction of his self-identity.The background of the character given to Lawrence in the film is that he is an illegitimate child, which is not consistent with history. The addition of such a background to the film provides a reasonable internal explanation for Lawrence and his heroic feats to a certain extent. That's why Lawrence wanted to gain personal respect for his identity as an illegitimate child as an officer did in Arabia to seize national independence for the Arab people. After arriving in Arabia, the first problem Lawrence faced was national identity. Lawrence broke through this disagreement through the death of the first person. This story happened when Lawrence entered the Bedouin tribe and they wanted to attack Akbar from behind. On the way, an Arab fell off the camel, and Lawrence turned around to rescue him despite the obstruction of everyone. You have to know that if there is no strong sense of direction and a coincidence with fate in the desert, he will never come back. But Lawrence did. When Lawrence returned to Bedouin, he said: ""Nothing is destined."" But it was also the Arab who was rescued, Lawrence fired the first shot. This is because the Arab killed another tribe, Lawrence needed to use his death to calm the conflict between the two tribes. Otherwise, the military operations against Akaba will be lost. So this life saved by him was eventually killed in his hands. The first death was that he entered Arabs as an Englishman in search of ethnic identity.The second death was his servant in Arabia. When Lawrence led the two tribes to capture Aqaba, he needed to report the news to the British army and obtain their military supplies, so he needed to cross the desert. During the crossing, one of his servants, Du De, was buried in the desert because of the quicksand. When he arrived in Cairo, he met the British generals in Arab costumes. So we can think of this death as Lawrence wants to be recognized by Britain.Later, his other servant, Faraki, could not be transferred with the troops because of the detonation tube. Lawrence ended his life with a pistol. So far, the two servants whom Lawrence first knew to take care of his life were killed. But Lawrence's identity as an Arab leader was not recognized by these tribes. When the Damascus campaign was finally launched, Lawrence picked up a pistol and shot the Turks. At the same time, the faith he held in his heart, the respect for life was also shot by him. He shot this time to enable the Arabs to personally recapture their capital. He wanted to integrate into the Arab tribe to gain their spiritual identity, not identity. But in the end, the government still did not recognize him, and he left just as he had just arrived in Arabia.We looked back, when Lawrence was sent to Dyden, Arabia, and he said, ""Great things start from a very small beginning."" Lawrence led the Arabs to national independence. This great event was sent to him Arab started from Lawrence's desire to gain his personal approval. Similarly, we can say that the Arab Revolution started with every spiritually independent Arab. This film has created a hero and a tragic hero. Lawrence led the Arabs before Allenby launched the battle to seize the capital Damascus, but this provisional Arab government he establishedLawrence could not be truly recognized. The tragedy also lies in the fact that for this battle and for the final result, he personally shot the beliefs he insisted on. So at the beginning of the film, Lawrence drove a motorcycle and died in a car accident on a country road. It is precisely the way of death in this tragedy.Lawrence is a hero or an ordinary man. His death made a conclusion about his life.",Lawrence of Arabia
155,shanayneigh,A true masterpiece,10,19 April 2021,"This is one of my favorite films of all time, I must have seen it at least a half dozen times. It is the gold standard for sweeping epics. In this age of streaming where everything must be a ""limited"" series, I always ask myself the question: Why did this have to be ten hours long when Lawrence of Arabia managed to tell a far more engaging story with a more complex character in a bit more than three?The story is epic in the true sense of the word. I can really recommend TE Lawrence's ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"". I have an illustrated De Luxe Edition from 1938, which is one of my most prized possessions. How O'Toole didn't win an Oscar for his portrayal of Lawrence is beyond me.But perhaps the most spectacular thing about the movie are the visuals. Like so many in my generation, I first saw this movie on VHS on a small 28"" TV screen, but even that was enough to blow me away. I then upgraded to the DVD and later the 50th anniversary blu-ray huge box set. I'm looking forward to the 4k, once it's a standalone release. But my most amazing experience with Lawrence of Arabia was three years ago, where I saw a restored 70mm print in a cinema on a huge screen. That is truly the way to experience this movie. How I would love to talk to David Lean and Freddie Young and her them describe how they got certain shots.I have studied Arabic and Middle Eastern studies at university, writing my Master's thesis in Political Science on Middle Eastern politics. It would be far too simplistic to say that my interest in the Middle East is because of this movie, but I certainly do owe some debt of gratitude to this masterpiece.Writing this review makes me want to see it again.

156,GeorgeRoots,The Epic Super Panavision Desert Masterpiece.,10,14 March 2015,"Though somewhat controversial in its depiction of certain events, once you sit through the first 30 minutes or so of David Lean's masterpiece you ask yourself ""How can I not love this movie""? From its outstanding ""matchstick"" cut, Freddie Young's cinematography and Maurice Jarre's phenomenal score, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" continues to be one of the most astounding practical effect movies ever made. Costing only $15 million dollars, to which Steven Spielberg claims that if made today shot for shot, it would be way over $250 million.Told in two parts, The film awkwardly begins by depicting the last moments of Lawrence's life and the attendees of his funeral who claim to have known his daring exploits. I don't feel like I've spoilt anything for you, because we are then immediately thrown into the beginning of the adventure. Following Lawrence on his travels with the Arabians on their revolt against the Turkish. An epic weave of unification, somewhat sadism and pleasant egotism amongst the characters has a scope way beyond that of a camera lens.There has been a somewhat controversy on how Lawrence has been portrayed in the film, but Peter O'Toole's performance is phenomenally impressive, and to me somewhat revolutionary considering certain acting sensibilities of 1960's Hollywood and World cinema (Then again, this was also the same year Gregory Peck astounded audiences with the Oscar winning performance in ""To Kill A Mocking Bird""). Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins and Omar Sharif do extraordinary work also (I wish Gertrude Bell had made an appearance somewhere). There's just too many great quotes uttered in this movie, and all the dialogue from ever actor is impeccable.Allow me to ramble on just a little bit longer, but the frontier is gorgeous. Whether it fades in from a previous scene, or emphasised by Maurice Jarre's score, it's one of the few films that makes me believe that when someone is dehydrated they really are. Lean's vision is vast through both its establishing shots and hundreds of extra's, reportedly he looked at John Ford's ""The Searchers"" (1956) for ideas and even some have made narrative references to Orson Welles's ""Citizen Kane"" (1941).Final Verdict: Regardless of what version you see, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is one of the great epics that truly deserve the title. In the years that will follow is it destined to remain as one of the tops? Let us just say that ""Nothing is written"". 10/10.",Lawrence of Arabia
157,Eternality,Lawrence Of Arabia is altogether an overrated motion picture.,9,12 December 2010,"Just like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, another great film disappoints me. While I appreciate both films for its technical quality, and understand the reason why they're considered top films, I have to confess that both aren't my favourites. Lawrence Of Arabia is David Lean at his prime. While I prefer his earlier work The Bridge On River Kwai, nothing beats what Lean has accomplished here.The strength of Lawrence Of Arabia is the cinematography. The desert sceneries are shot in a manner that reflects the desolateness, and starkness of the natural conditions, yet capturing the still beauty of the desert. Unfortunately, unless you have a cinema at your disposal, Lawrence Of Arabia isn't going to work well on television. It has to be experienced in a theatre, with a screen so wide it can fulfill what the filmmakers intended to achieve - an unforgettable journey into the heart of one of the world's most uninhabitable places.Peter O'Toole stars as the title character in a performance that borders on the colossal to the forgettable. Two factors that make me look down on the film are the repetitive dialogue (what a bland script!) used by the cast, as well as the content the film offers. There are epics that are more involving, and entertaining such as Ben-Hur, and Dances With Wolves. This, sadly, has comparatively nothing much to offer except for the outstanding photography. In my eyes, Lawrence Of Arabia is altogether an overrated motion picture.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Lawrence of Arabia

I didn't realize both these traits until I crossed halfway. What goes right for it is the solid base material, extravagant production design and a start-of-art output from all its technical departments, but a big letdown from the acting front.Follows a brief but an influential episode of British Army personnel T.E.

Also takes on his relationship with the feuding tribal leaders Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) and Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn).

Occasionally Omar Sharif and most other small time Arab characters have given a horrendous performance diluting the epic scale production to a B-grade ripoff. The set pieces, number of personnel used combined with equal number of camels and horses would have made it a very complex project to produce but the final product has come out in flying colors. The cinematography and the desert locations were exotic and exquisite while the battle sequences which are neither gory nor inspires awe are saved by sweeping background score that perfectly compliments and elevates the drama.

161,bwaynef,"Great, but could have been greater",9,4 April 1999,"""Ben-Hur"" won more Oscars, ""Spartacus"" had a more accessible cast, but ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" David Lean's 1962 biography of the enigmatic British officer known as much for his flamboyance as he was for his bravery, is regarded by most critics and film historians as the greatest of all epics. Originally 222 minutes long, then cut and recut for various re-issues, the winner of 7 Academy Awards was restored to a nearly intact running time of 216 minutes and re-released to great acclaim in 1989.  What makes ""Lawrence"" so special?  The general consensus seems to be that the film is ""literate,"" while so many of these big scale epics are not.  True enough, but it seems to me that ""literate"" is often a euphemism for ""dull.""""Lawrence"" does make good use of its 3 hours and 36 minutes, so it isn't dull, but I am at a loss to find one truly exciting moment.  Even the battle scenes are subdued, and nothing really stirred my emotions the way ""Spartacus"" managed to do. What is fascinating, however, is the portrait--fairly ambiguous--drawn by Peter O' Toole, who achieved international stardom as a result of this role.  His Lawrence is somewhat ethereal, yet brave and compassionate. The alleged homosexuality of the real Lawrence--a taboo for on-screen exploration back in 1962--seems to be suggested by O' Toole's occasionally fey manner and by some of the dialogue in the script.  ""I'm not an ordinary man,"" Lawrence tells one of his superiors in the British service.  The man's reaction is enlightening:  ""I'm not talking about THAT!"" he says.Otherwise, ""Lawrence"" features the usual roundup of British actors one usually finds in these things (Alec Guiness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quayle, et al), and Arthur Kennedy, basically reviving the newspaperman role he essayed two years earlier in ""Elmer Gantry.""  Does it sound like I'm panning Mr. Lean's epic film?  I hope not.

This epic adventure drama is based on the life of T.E. Lawrence, played here y Peter O'Toole. The bulk of the story centers around Lawrence's experiences in the Middle East during World War I, particularly some of the large battles he took place In and his Involvement in the Arab National Council. There's more than just action here though, Lawrence is a deeply conflicted man who struggles with some internal turmoil as well as the inevitable violence that arises during war times.Don't settle for watching it on your rink-dink phone or even your TV, take the time to seek it out and find a theatre near you that's showing it on a giant screen because this movie features such breathtaking sights that you will be missing out otherwise. Oh, you'll still be able to appreciate the scale and cinematography elsewhere, but it won't be the same. Regardless of where you see it, the excellent performances and epic storyline will have you cheering. What struck me in particular Is the cinematography. Several shots show armies rushing through enormous landscapes high above, and In one particularly memorable scene a tiny dot on the horizon reveals itself to be a lone rider, coming towards the camera. Writing it down just doesn't do it justice.Consistently, I found myself scratching my head wondering ""how did they do that?"" All of these enormous crowd shots or scenes featuring raids on trains featuring clockwork-like coordination make me wonder. It looks like the film was either done in one take or the sand was painstakingly cleaned to look like it was undisturbed between re-shoots. There were no computers in 1962 and yet this looks as Impressive as the $150 million CGI fests that we get every summer. As Lawrence, Peter O'Toole's performance is amazing. He really portrays the feelings of someone who is tortured and divided inside, but almost isn't allowed to worry about it because of the huge burden on his shoulders. The story, despite its multiple characters and multiple locations (several of which have foreign, difficult to pronounce names that you will probably have trouble remembering) is clear and easy to follow. If there's any fault it's that at times the film is overwhelming. So much goes on and there's so much that happens beneath the surface of our hero's exterior that you will have to watch it multiple times to get a real handle on all of it. There is so much greatness here it's hard to describe it all. It's a landmark in filmmaking and you've probably seen countless parodies and clips of the film over the years, so for that reason alone it's worth a watch.It's a long show, but you won't mind thanks to the intermission and it will really stick with you. It's more than worth your time. I feel guilty admitting this but I almost had a bit of pre-conceived negative feelings towards it because I'd heard people almost trying to guilt me into watching it because they called it ""The greatest movie of all time"". Now the only person I feel resentment towards is me for not checking it out sooner. Even if you don't absolutely fall in love with it, there's no doubt you will be very impressed.

I thought this could have been easily shorter than 227 minutes!These were my thoughts when I saw this when I was 18-which was 2 years ago. Now I'm 20, and I had gotten rid of my old DVD.

I find myself riveted with the opening, and yes, some parts did go longer that it should have, but like 2001: A Space Odyssey, such moments should be simply experienced and taken in, and then it is not so bad.Seeing it again, I noticed many powerful moments, such as: the cut to a sunset, the quicksand scene, Lawrence getting his robe, etc.There are also great lines, like(paraphrases below):""What do you like about the desert?""

It tops even The Bridge on the River Kwai in terms of epic storytelling. Peter O'Toole hits the character of Lawrence right on the nose and Guinness also gets a great role that allows him to expand with his acting technique. Yet the budget and the sheer effort that went into this filmmaking is what really makes this one so interesting to watch for over 3 hours. Few blockbusters have such an emphasis on psychological idiosyncrasies than Lean's film. That is why Lean is more advanced in storytelling against DeMille or Stevens.,Lawrence of Arabia
167,antagonist117,"An unambiguously glorious film about an ambiguous, vainglorious life",10,19 February 2014,"The people who come to T.E. Lawrence's funeral at the beginning of David Lean's biopic to end all biopics set forth two interpretations of the man that this film grapples with over its almost 4-hour runtime. Some are there to mourn a hero, a man who seemed to embody British hardiness and courage in an age of empire and global war. These true believers had followed his exploits as a leader in the Arab uprising against Ottoman rule, and for them he was an exotic, dashing figure out of Oriental legend, but with blue eyes and blond hair. Others in the crowd at Lawrence's massive public funeral are there not to mourn him, but to mark the passing of a rude, irresponsible braggart. Many present claim to have known him, but the ones who knew him best seem to be the ones who like him least. With this dichotomy of opinion in mind, the film takes us through the key events in Lawrence's campaigns. It does not insist upon a particular interpretation, but neither does it try to remain merely (and impossibly) objective.The depictions of Lawrence's treks across the desert have a majesty rarely equaled. Lean holds long shots of endless sand and blinding blue skies until they become sublime. Other directors known for their landscapes, like John Ford and Peter Jackson, usually have the advantage of filming soaring mountain ranges or colorful canyons, but Lean and his 3-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Freddie Young take vistas and palettes that are almost minimalist and turn them into visions of raw beauty. The score by Maurice Jarre, also a 3-time Academy Award recipient (all of Jarre's and Young's Oscars were for their collaborations with Lean) does its part and more, bringing a weighty romanticism to each scene and mirroring Lawrence's own unbounded emotionality.But of course the greatest and most indispensable element of the film is Peter O'Toole's performance as Lawrence. The young actor manages to present both Lawrences, the compelling and the off-putting, as a complete person with an inner universe of ambition and fear and assuredness and madness that he wears on his sleeve but that remains tantalizingly unknowable, the way historical figures' essential natures almost always are. O'Toole draws attention to himself seemingly without trying, even while sharing scenes with actors of such skill and presence as Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and Claude Raines, to whom are given most of the script's juiciest one-liners.I used to quibble with the sequence in which which Lawrence is taken captive by a Turkish commander during a nighttime sabotage mission and subjected to an implied threat of sexual abuse. I had always felt that it didn't quite fit; it suggested ideas that did not return for exploration later and that did not seem to have a lasting effect on Lawrence in spite of O'Toole's particularly tormented performance in the scene. I changed my mind about it when I learned, as many fans of the movie probably know well, that it is based on Lawrence's own public account of the incident. His private account, uncovered much later in a letter he wrote to a confidant, suggests that more happened than he was willing to admit, and O'Toole's heightened acting in this moment now seems perfectly consistent with the real Lawrence feelings about the event. I now think that to go further with this scene or to call it back later would be to enter the realm of speculation, while to omit it would be to excise one of the most remarkable episodes in Lawrence's own writings.The real Lawrence was an unreliable but fascinating narrator of his adventures, and the film adaptation of his life is exceptionally effective at creating a well-rounded portrait of the man. By the end, we cannot agree with the people at his funeral who see only the courageous and noble Lawrence. We have seen him at his most unstable, and have learned to question his motives and his sanity. In a moment of obvious but delicious irony, we have seen him, his identity concealed, earn the enmity of one of the very men who would later speak highly of him. All the same, we cannot dismiss him as easily as his detractors. His achievements are too spectacular, the life he lived too remarkable not to elicit some degree of admiration. As for the movie itself, the degree of admiration warranted is unambiguously very, very high.",Lawrence of Arabia

Supported by Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinnes and an immortal performance by Omar Sharif. Lawrence of rabia won the Oscar for Best Picture and Davi Lean for Best Director. Maurice Jarre won for his legendary score. Oddly neither O'Toole nor Sharif won Oscars.

169,dumsumdumfai,why is this my favourite film,10,9 September 2008,"Roger Ebert wrote an excellent article on this topic ""whats_your_favorite_movie"" And his choice is La Dolce Vita, this is my choice.I first saw this as a young teenager, in the middle of the night, some movie channel re-run, when infomercials hadn't come to fruition yet. But don't think I finished it, but I remember the matchstick scene.mind you, there are 2 kinds of boys - one turn on by mystery, the other by excitement. i'm the first kind if you have not already guested.Sometimes later, still as a teenager, I saw the complete film, again late nite movie channel. from the opening the music, the motorcycle scene it got my attention. Then it as the desert scenes. I admired the external beauty of the shots. The film stayed in my mind, mythical almost, but not fully understandable - certain aspect bothered me to a degree, but I didn't pursuit it further. Looking back, it is the finding of oneself, true self and live it - however improbable it is was probably the underlying attraction. And i didn't understand the torture scene part - too subtle for my attention at the time.Yet again, years later I saw it re-release 70mm, wide screen. It didn't feel great, but why did I go?When I started traveling, by chance I visited Egypt, Jordan and the 7 pillars location, the wells, and the dunes in the edge of Sahara. then I understood the beauty and the illusion of the desert - that it ""seems"" infinite, without bearings, within a measure of how far, how near, how to measure/gauge things - almost anything - even your emotions to some level. That is the aura and that is how one can feel in life some times. The movie is a more or less a search for self - a self that may or may not know the enormity of the situation that is in and what comes may. But through character, the situation changes the character and the character changes the situation. But isn't it also based on true events ? Yes, but these are then re-interpreted by David Lean. Is Lawrence a great man? For me, this movie shows not really. He is just true to his character and convictions, act when called upon, suggests what he knows but may not understand, fighting his fears and dignity when he needs to. Given others, maybe they will fade away - be aware of the situation and sell-out. Or be part of the story but not the forefront - like the 2 servants.Later on, when friends would ask me what is your favourite movie, I would say 'Lawrence' without really knowing why. Now after reading Ebert's article I know.",Lawrence of Arabia
170,ajkbiotech,One of the best long films of all time,10,9 April 2021,"This film tells the story of the fifth column revolt of the Arabs against the Ottoman Empire in the South regions during World War I, led by a curious English fellow who adopted Arab dress and language and ways, TE Lawrence aka Lawrence of Arabia, much more famous in 1962 when the film came out than now.This is one of my personal favorite films ever. The Turkish armies are legendary for their valid and skill for 800 years. Defeating them was no easy thing. The guerrila campaign waged by Lawrence and the Arabs was brilliant.The film shows this, and tells a story about broken promises of full independence to the Arabs as well, matters which have had repercussions to the current day.A must see.",Lawrence of Arabia

172,krational66,Lawrence's Dream,8,26 April 2020,"It was undoubtedly one of the films that had a huge impact on me, and I have to say that Lawrence's fate is still one of the most important frames of reference for me to find myself.In the film, Lawrence's life in the Arab world during this period was full of ambition, high spirits and boundless scenery. Although he experienced ups and downs several times, it ended up in frustration and grief. Perhaps because of the director's realist tendencies, or perhaps because of the length of the film, it is not clear why Lawrence was so interested in the Arab world, and the motives of several big ups and downs, which has become the focus of Lawrence's puzzlement. To my mind, all of that is rooted in the idealism that runs in Lawrence's blood. In other words, in the depths of Lawrence's soul, there were several dreams floating around.Dream one: to be born. Why do you like this desert? Lawrence: clean. Yes, compared to the secular world in which they live, there is a cleaner place than the sand rolling desert?Dream two: universal salvation. In the film, Lawrence has a distinctive personality. When he first met the new governor after he captured akaba, the new governor made a brief summary of Lawrence before he came to the Arab world: ""no self-discipline, no punctuality, several languages, music, literature, knowledge..."" . It can be seen that Lawrence was a talented, rebellious and independent man. The film is also heavy on Lawrence's extremely kind and benevolent character. Because of his outstanding talent, he is full of ambition; Because of his rebellion, he was critical of all the seemingly impregnable realities. Because of his kindness, he has universal compassion; Perhaps only such a man, seeing a divided, benighted Arab world, would naturally produce the great dream of a united Arab world and a free Arab people.Dream # 3: chasing your own existence. ""Who am I? It should be the question that Lawrence pursued all his life. The trajectory of Lawrence's personal development is never mentioned in the film, but Lawrence is confronted several times with whether he is British or Arab or someone else. In this quest, there are two images that make people feel sad. One is the first time Lawrence wears an Arabic turban on his head and hops around the desert in his traditional Arab costume. Scene 2: Lawrence lifts up his shirt and points at his skin, then shouts at ali, ""see, I'm white! You can never change that!"" The large Arab clothing once let him think he found his own place, but, the white skin will he mercilessly drove away from their pursuit of home for years. Perhaps the search for himself had been Lawrence's most distant dream.Dream 4: pursue your own perfection. Defects, whether external or internal, were perhaps the last thing Lawrence himself wanted to be discovered. Even in his voluminous abaya, Lawrence remained elegant. When such grace was trampled upon by the Turkish soldiers, Lawrence's faith collapsed: his own compassion, his own dignity in the face of the ruthless reality is just a dream! I would rather Lawrence had never actually walked into the endless desert at the moment of his mad revenge for the slaughter of Turkey.The beauty of the dream may be in its faint come true, however, the dream will eventually wake up one day, idealism in the end can not resist the reality of the existence of a light blow. Your life goes on, you still exist in this secular world; You were born in England, and you will return to rest in England; Your wit and bravery are boundless, but the unspeakable antiquity and mystery of the Arab world has far exceeded your wisdom. After waking up, you are bound to be helpless and sad, you can not escape as a person with the same fate.If all these dreams seem bleak and capricious, does Lawrence leave no warm eternity in the sand? Although there is no mention of Lawrence's emotional world in the film, there are a lot of rumors about Lawrence outside the film, especially his famous poem ""to S"" in ""the seven pillars of wisdom"". The preface to ""A"" may presage his fifth, more obscure dream.",Lawrence of Arabia
173,daoldiges,Grand and Intimate Epic,10,12 June 2018,"For some unknown reason I've always had an attraction to this film and it's enigmatic lead character. Which is why I went all through my high school and college years refusing to see it on the small screen in the hopes that I would someday have the chance to see it on the big screen. I was about to give up when in 1987 they released the 25th anniversary edition. Boy, am I glad I waited. I was not disappointed and this film was even more than I'd imagined it to be, which is super tough considering I'd been building it up in my mind for almost 15 years. The story, score, costumes, performances and most significantly Lean's deft and inspired direction all held me captivated from beginning to end. I'd read several biographies of T.E. Lawrence, and was this film a wholly accurate depiction of him and the events during the Arab campaign, not exactly. Then again it's a dramatic film inspired by Lawrence and not a documentary, which is why I take issue with those who complain that the film is not a detail by detail account and I remind myself that for every film inspired by either a real person or book that there will always be those hold-outs who refuse to allow themselves to fully enjoy art for arts sake. Oh well, their loss. As for me and anyone else reading this review I cannot recommend this film enough, and if possible see it on the big screen to fully appreciate it. I am an admirer of Lean's work but do want to add that I actually appreciate the full theatrical release quite a bit more than the special director's cut release.",Lawrence of Arabia
174,Hancock_the_Superb,"The Greatest Film Ever Made, And The Definition of ""Epic""",10,8 April 2006,"T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is an eccentric British army officer who is serving as a minor staff officer in Cairo during World War I, until General Murray (Donald Wolfit), the commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, is convinced by Dryden (Claude Rains), the slippery chief of the Arab Bureau, to dispatch Lawrence - who has knowledge of Arab culture from his pre-war visits to the region - as a liaison officer to forces of the faltering Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, led by Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness). Ignoring the skepticism of the already-present British officer, Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), he convinces Feisal and the latter's chief lieutenant, the fiery Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif), to allow him a small expedition to seize the Turkish-held seaport of Aqaba, Jordan. Undertaking an impossible forced march through the Nefud Desert, Lawrence is successful, becoming first accepted by the Arabs and then made into a sort of superhero, and succeeds in recruiting the flamboyant chieftain of the Howeitat tribe, Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) to his cause in the process. This catches the attention of the British general staff in Cairo - including General Edmund Allenby (Jack Hawkins), who has replaced Murray - who decide to supply Lawrence with arms and supplies to wage a guerrilla war against Turkey to complement Allenby's conventional attacks - but with a tight leash, as Britain (and France) have designs on the Middle East. Encouraged by his victories and an American journalist (Arthur Kennedy) who is looking for a hero, Lawrence lets his fame get to his head, thus beginning a long downward spiral as he discovers his own fallibility, the perfidy of his commanders, and that, no matter where he is, he must always be an outsider.There isn't really a negative thing that can be said about this film. The cinematography and direction is simply the best in any movie ever, there's no doubt about it. Lean is a master of the epic scope, and his amazing, non-stop shots of large bodies of men moving through the vast desert is simply beautiful, and more surprisingly never gets old (at least for me). Freddie Young's cinematography does an excellent job of showing the vastness of the desert, as well as just how insignificant people - even an army of 2,000 Arabs on horse/camel-back - are in it. The entrance of Ali at the well is just an amazing scene, done with no music - nothing but a camera pointed at a black figure emerging from the vast wasteland of the desert. The battle scenes also deserve credit, too: in times when ""Lord of the Rings"" relies on CGI battle sequences, it's refreshing to watch a film which uses thousands of REAL people. The most amazing of these is the attack on Aqaba, which ends with an amazing thirty-second panning shot, showing the Arabs swarming through the entire town, finally settling on a Turkish cannon that is pointed to the sea ""and cannot be turned 'round"". The raid on the Turkish supply train, and of course the massacre of the retreating Turks towards the end (""No prisoners!"") are no less effective, the latter being a much more potent anti-war message than all of the films of Oliver Stone combined. Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson write a wonderfully literate and thoughtful script (with amazing relevance to current events in the Middle East today). And need I even mention Maurice Jarre's amazing score? The cast is flawless. Peter O'Toole is simply amazing as Lawrence, giving one of the most compelling performances is cinematic history. He is able to convincingly portray Lawrence's massive shift in character: going from an arrogant outcast, to a man who believes in his own infallibility, to a man who is finally a broken shell, disillusioned by his own violent acts and his manipulation by his superiors. O'Toole's performance is simply stunning, and it's no wonder this movie made him a star. Omar Sharif is also impressive as Ali, a charismatic character who is the perfect foil for Lawrence's shifting personality. Alec Guinness is solid as Feisal, who is both sagely and cynical at turns (I am convinced that George Lucas cast Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi because of this performance). Jack Hawkins deserves credit for making Allenby both manipulative of and sympathetic to Lawrence simultaneously. Anthony Quinn and Claude Rains steal every scene they're in - Quinn with speeches and flamboyant gestures, Rains with marvelous dry underplaying. Jose Ferrer does a nice job cramming a lot of interesting depth into the Turkish officer who captures (and does other things) to Lawrence, considering that he has all of five minutes on screen. Arthur Kennedy (as the Lowell Thomas-esquire reporter, Jackson Bentley) and Anthony Quayle (as Brighton, the stuffy Brit who grows to respect Lawrence over the course of the film) round out the cast nicely.Simply put, there is no other film quite like this. It is the ultimate epic/adventure movie, and MUST be scene in widescreen to be appreciated. I have the fortune of owning a plasma TV with surround sound, which is about as close to seeing it in a theater as you can get. Do NOT watch this movie pan-scan, or it will be ruined.If the only reason why you wouldn't watch this movie is ""length"" - well, that's your problem for missing out on THE greatest cinematic experience of all time. You can have your ""Titanic"" or ""Return of the King""; I'll take ""Lawrence of Arabia"" any day.",Lawrence of Arabia

176,lyubitelfilmov,"His Majesty's Partisan or Nearly ""The Lord's End"" of historical cinema",8,26 February 2021,"Historical drama. Well, I got to this epic, which I planned to watch eight years ago, when the disc with this picture was sold in our Soyuz chain of stores. But then it did not work, because the circumstances were higher. Well, now I got there, because I was carried away by old paintings (thanks to the beautiful Audrey Hepburn). I was almost completely delighted with the picture, well, here's my short opinion - His Majesty's Partisan. Despite this, there was one drawback in the picture, which I will definitely mention, but for now, let me focus your attention on the advantages of this epic historical drama.
So, here they are:
1. Scenario - the film tells about the life and service of Lieutenant (future colonel) of the British army Thomas Edward Lawrence, who received the nickname ""Arabian"" for his military exploits in the desert. The script is based on his autobiographical book The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. It was he who played a key role in the Arab uprising of 1916-1918 in the Middle East. This topic is quite interesting, where the interests of the leading powers of the world and the aspirations of the local population for independence collide. And it is interesting to follow this, although it will take a very long time (the picture goes for almost four hours). Politics, emotions of people on both sides, clash of cultures of two different worlds, personal experiences of the hero, and so on. Well, about the final, I can only say one thing: ""The Moor has done his job, the Moor can leave."" Vital, partly tragic, but true.
2. Lawrence of Arabia is a rather strange hero, I would say, even extravagant, we have here. He is brave, sometimes decisive, but his behavior drives into a stupor both his fellow British and Arabs, for whom he is a mystery. His reflection goes throughout the whole picture, but it's not boring to watch. Sometimes you are perplexed by his actions, but mentally you build a logical chain for this, and even find an excuse for the hero.
3. Two worlds - the picture shows the British and the Arabs, two completely different cultures and even worldviews in a difficult situation, when both peoples had common interests and they acted together against the once mighty Ottoman Empire. Moreover, the picture respects the customs of the Arab tribes, and does not exhibit them in a caricature. Yes, and the British shows who they were, especially politicians (who are the same in any country and under any political regime).
4. Scale - the scale of this historical event is felt in the picture, because there are a lot of extras here and everyone performs verified movements and allows the viewer to believe in what is happening. Trains, planes, armored vehicles - everything is real, although it fires blank cartridges of course. Almost Lord of the Rings, almost!
5. Costumes, decorations - I can't say where exactly the picture was filmed, but definitely in the desert and adjacent territories. For everything looks realistic, because I watched the restored version. The costumes are of the highest standard and look authentically of the sought after era. Although there are clearly exaggerated details, this does not spoil the image.
6. Gorgeous music - what else catches in this picture is the musical accompaniment. Where the London Symphony Orchestra played a key role. And you can listen to it for a long time and even separately from the picture, and have fun. Music creates the right atmosphere and perfectly underlines the key moments of the story being told. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
7. Politics is a cynical and insidious craft, which played its role here too. Cruel, unfair (although not without a certain logic). She is present in the whole picture, like the shadow of Hamlet's father, and enters the stage at the right and most logical moment, throwing her dirty hands into the desert that has not yet cooled with blood. That's all right. For the soldiers, politicians always come, who will bury the young guys with honors, and after an hour they will forget about their existence, drinking brandy in their office.
Now about the minus. Why are there no large-scale battles? After all, you have an epic canvas on a historical theme, right? So why are there practically no battles here? A couple of camel races and some tinsel on the railroad doesn't count. I understand that in Lawrence's book it was, but you are shooting an artistic picture, where the genre itself allows you to deviate from the canon and show staginess. So why didn't they? It's a shame, because the potential was revealed, but not completely.
And yet - the picture is very long and at least forty minutes can be safely cut out and the meaning and logic will not be broken. The godlessly stretched scene spoils the overall impression.
A little about the main characters:
1. Lawrence of Arabia performed by Peter O'Toole - an officer in the British army who became the organizer and symbol of the Arab uprising. A brave, daring commander who earned the trust of the Arabs and even fell in love with them. The hero is non-standard, and therefore deserves attention. Peter did a great job with the role that opened up Hollywood for him, but I first saw him in the great comedy How to Steal a Million. Moreover, outwardly, Peter is very similar to Lawrence. Bravo!
2. Sheriff Ali, played by Omar Sharif, is an influential Arab of one of the many tribes, who at first disliked Lawrence, but later became his best friend. A brave, decisive and colorful hero who glorified the Egyptian actor Omar Sharif all over the world, and deserves it. Bravo Omar!
I cannot fail to mention Anthony Quinn, who played the role of the charismatic leader Audu ibu Tayi.
The picture received seven Oscar statuettes, and each is absolutely deserved!
This is exactly how you need to approach the restoration of the classics. Why can't domestic publishers do this? We don't have our classics? Yes, there is, only there is no desire.
As a result, he has a good historical drama, with an excellent script, grandiose scale, great costumes and sets, great music and great acting.
My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",Lawrence of Arabia
177,rhinocerosfive-1,Lawrence Ad Nauseam,4,28 April 2009,"Paul Theroux and Jorge Luis Borges once discussed T.E. Lawrence's book SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM. Theroux, in response to Borges' praise of it, said a clever thing: ""How can a book about Arabs not be funny?"" True. SEVEN PILLARS, while wonderful in many respects, is a relentlessly grim chronicle of disillusionment. In this respect, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is true to its source material. But this does not deserve reverence. To repeat a mistake is to commit an even greater folly.Grandiose does not equal grand, and spectacle is not of itself spectacular. Yes, this movie looks great, and it is one of the most auspicious and audacious entrances an actor has ever made onto the world stage. But man, is it dull. Anyone not bored by multiple offerings of five minutes' empty pageantry - a thousand camels marching off to battle (which never is satisfactorily joined) - is more easily amused than I. I liked this movie when I was a kid. Now I do not like this movie. It is too long, for one thing, not that long is bad per se, but long and incoherent is very bad. I've finally noticed that what's really wrong with this picture, aside from being directed by the most overrated A-lister in the history of the tenth art, is its inability to tell a story. What is going on at any given point after the first couple of hours - in the campaign, in T.E.'s head, in the battle - is obviously of inferior importance to how it looks. Now, this is a major achievement. To be incoherent in a travelogue-depth 4-hour yawnathon of pedantic phrasemaking is not only to defeat the purpose of a travelogue (which is to make clear for adults what was possibly too confusing for children), it is to complicate the logic of simplicity by means cunning and nefarious, for no apparent gain or purpose. I am amazed that it could be done. But then David Lean is the thinking man's Roland Emmerich - if the thinking man doesn't mind being made to think the same thing over and over. Other giants of the epic travelogue - John Sturges, Lawrence Kasdan, Richard Attenborough, Mel Gibson, Ridley Scott, Peter Jackson - while boring and/or insulting me much of the time, at least usually manage to get the ideas across in a shot or two, abetted by dialog best presented on T-shirts. If Noel Coward had been the director, instead of just a third unit helpmate to his old partner, it would have made sense and it would have been two hours shorter and it would have been better. In fact it would have been good.I have to admit that while no less bad, most of Lean's other gigantic pieces of shite, like BRIDGE ON THE RIVER WHY? and DOCTOR ZZZZZZ, do not confuse me. They are good traditional travelogues in the Old Hollywood vein: say it early, say it often, say it again if in doubt. Funny, 'cause I kind of like his GREAT EXPECTATIONS, a much more watchable film (and certainly not small in scope) than the book is readable. But going back that far I believe he was still under the influence of his benign Svengali, Coward.",Lawrence of Arabia
178,JaydoDre,Epic visual experience. A few minor story issues.,8,4 December 2014,"It took me about five minutes of screen time to realize that was going to like this movie. Key behind that realisation is the introduction of the main character of the film. Peter O'Toole plays an intelligent and cheeky Thomas Lawrence ""Lawrence of Arabia"" with an exquisitely charming arrogance.Lawrence of Arabia is a phenomenal looking film. The scenes contract and grow. A small speckle of a man on horizon with quiet music in the background grows into a riding warrior with a roar of the main theme. It is amazing in how many different ways the film manages to show the majestic desert. And although having a large quantity of actors is not a merit, it sure does make an impression when a few hundred of them charge on horseback. This film can fill a person with wanderlust.Music plays a very important part in the presentation of the visuals and the makers were clearly quite proud of the orchestral compositions. The theme of Lawrence of Arabia is instantly recognizable. Unfortunately, the main hook of the theme does overstay its welcome as it comes back at the slightest opportunity, albeit in different form.If there is one word for this film it is ""epic"". it is so in every way. In way of story, the Arab uprising during World War I was of importance to its outcome and subsequent history. In way of visuals, the large battles and the massive desert capture the mind. In way of characters, flamboyant historical leaders. This film is so epic it is one of those movies that has an overture,and an intermission with an entr'acte.A cool thing about Lawrence of Arabia is how relevant it still is. ""So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe,"" he said, ""so long will they be a little people, a silly people"". No offense to the Arab readers, but those who know something about the current state of affairs know how much this still applies. The general themes in the film are timeless, much like the deserts.So is it perfect? No, it has a number of unnatural moments in its story. There is a character in this film who is shown to be a cold and unpleasant person, but over a fairly short period of time he is suddenly transformed into a good guy and the protagonist goes from hating him to being friendly. The way Lawrence persuades another hostile characters to join him later on also still puzzles me.This film thoroughly rubs the spirit of Thomas Lawrence. The man is portrayed as half god, almost always right and successful. ""The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away"" is actually a plot point in this movie. The main character does get humbled, but only for a short time. I understand that the character thinks much of himself but the movie clearly agrees with him.This handling of character is not necessarily a flaw in itself but it adds to the aforementioned unnatural feel this movie sometimes has. Also, as you may imagine, the God comparison may be somewhat offensive to religious people. There is a central theme in this movie in which the Muslims keep indicating that ""it was written"" referring to predestination belief that appears in both Muslim and Christian faiths, but Lawrence keeps indicating and proving through his acts that nothing is written for him, and convincing those around him it seems. Lawrence indirectly compares himself to Moses and his servants tell him ""it shall be so, Lord"" as he wears white robes. Meanwhile, one of the Arab chieftains is shown to be greedy and the Arabs are shown to be barbaric.Nevertheless, Lawrence of Arabia is one of the most interesting films of all time. It is pretty and smart and makes you wonder about it after you are done watching it.",Lawrence of Arabia
179,BigJimNoFool,Bloated classic,6,24 October 2020,Still looks spectacular especially the first 1hr in the desert. The sunsets glimmer in a radiant orange and by day the briilant blue sky cuts the horizon perfectly against the golden sand. I really enjoyed just looking at it.The performances are good but not great i feel as i had very little engagement emotionally with any of the characters and that is a big issue in a film of this length.Some funny lines here and there are welcome from the baggy script that does feel rather bloated at times. There are sequences that could have been much shorter with the film as a whole feeling like a slog in parts.A good watch that i certainly wont be in any hurry to repeat but im glad to have experienced this film of modern classic status.,Lawrence of Arabia

It set a standard for how epic movies 'should' be made; and, David Lean later did it again in 1965 with ""Doctor Zhivago.""Peter O'Toole is just perfect in the role of Thomas Edward (T.E.) Lawrence, a simple young British Army Lieutenant sent to speak with Arab tribal leaders in an attempt to get them to fight the Turkish who are conquering their territories. Instead, he's not simple at all, but, very complex, and, exceeding his orders, Lawrence convinces these Arab tribal leaders to set aside petty squabbles with each other and that each tribe is weak by themselves...but, strong if they all unite.This is a heavenly masterpiece! To me, definitely one of the greatest epic movies ever made. It rivals another 'later' David Lean movie classic, ""Doctor Zhivago.""Although completely different in subject, this movie is in the same '11-Star Class' as ""The Godfather;"" ""Schindler's List;"" ""Star Wars;"" ""The Man Who Would Be King;"" ""Rocky;"" ""The Longest Day;"" ""A Bridge Too Far;"" ""Cross Of Iron;"" ""The Wild Bunch;"" ""Das Boot;"" ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" ""The Good, The Bad, and, The Ugly;"" ""The Lord of the Rings;"" ""The Green Mile;"" ""Silence of the Lambs;"" ""Goodfellas;"" etc...IT'S AN EPIC CLASSIC!It's film-making excellence! :)",Lawrence of Arabia
182,JohnWelles,Mesmerisng.,10,19 April 2009,"David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) is one of the few films that I would call mesmerising. The acting by all the leads is brilliant. Peter O'Tool is just superb as Lawrence. His performance could quite possibly be the greatest role ever. Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal was one of the more strange acting choices (he plays an Arab), but Guinness is very good and (the then) newcomer Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali ibn el Kharish is astonishingly good, and there are a lot more great actors in the movie like Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, and Arthur Kennedy. All the different departments did everything to perfection, (espesially the breathtaking Cinematography by Freddie Young) and the direction and script are flawless. One to watch in a sitting.

But the historical inaccuracies make this virtually unwatchable, knowing its a piece of fiction being passed off as fact.

184,kurosawakira,There With Him,9,16 November 2013,"Considering that our earthly wandering in its part consists of many rather obnoxious and disappointing film experiences, it's still so that even one blissful erases a hundred sour ones. These wonderful films, so much larger than life, it seems, that the disks they're stored on hardly contain them, ferocious as they are, make the heart beat faster.I've seen this quite a few times, and still it always puts me in my place as if I had somehow managed to unravel its secrets. Each time the journey is, as it is with the greatest of epic masterworks (""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Profound Desires of the Gods"" and their ilk) not only undiminished but even more powerful. Some of the images are so strong I'm not only carrying them with me but implementing them in my own life.And this only considering the visual narrative. This is, in other respects as well, perfect. The cinematography, music, script and dialogue, the ensemble acting, and, above all, O'Toole. He's so brilliant: Proustian in his self-reflexive fragility, flamboyantly sexy (more than Deloin at his most Deloin, or Bowie at his most Bowie).Please remember that film criticism offers subjective opinion as objective fact, and is more than anything an exercise in projected power. That said, this is so perfect it's hard not to be vague, not to lapse into paroxysms of emotion and say nothing at all. This might not be a bad thing in the end, however. One of the motifs in the film is the film is exactly this kind of otherworldliness and the disconnect between the two worlds: how can anyone in the film understand why Lawrence fell in love with the desert, and did the things he did, except for us, who were there with him?",Lawrence of Arabia
185,kris-gray,"Overlong, overrated but no women, worth ten stars for that alone.",7,27 August 2021,"I have read a number of reviews on here from one star, over harsh, to ten stars, overrated.The main complaint is it is far too long, something I have to agree with, it could have been cut to 2 hours without losing any of the plot and action.Another complaint is the sand, lots of it, what do you expect from a film set in a desert? The forests of the Ardennes?A number of reviews, mostly with female names, complain about no female lead or any women come to that. The day I see a woman in WW1 film fighting I'll do more than eat my hat. So where would a woman fit into this film? Answer they wouldn't, it's a war film and women were only good for handing out white feathers at the time. Crowbarring a woman into this just for the sake of having a woman in it would be absurd.Peter O'Toole and Sharif are perfect, sure Alec Guinness playing an Arab might have been okay at the time but only looks odd now, at least Anthony Quinn managed to pull it off. I read on here that Marlon Brando was considered to play Lawrence, now that would have been a travesty, it would have been Brando of Arabia with his appalling British accent (See Mutiny on the Bounty for an example)I first saw this film aged 11 in 1962, if I was going to be bored by it I would have been then. I was mesmerized by the sheer expanse of the super wide screen which almost made me feel as if I were in it. So much of that is lost on a small screen (TV) which doesn't help. So if you bad reviewers ever get the chance to see it in its 70mm glory you might just change your minds.Certainly not one the greatest films ever made, but neither is it the worst.

Lawrence has given a performance of a lifetime.Peter will always be remembered as Lawrence.The man who loved the desert.The man who united Arabia.The man whose conflicting loyalties made Arabia a united country.The rest of the performances specially that of Alec Guinness(Prince Feisal),Anthony Quinn(Auda Abu Tayi) & not to forget Omar Sharif(Sheriff Ali) are terrific.Brilliant performances from everyone.The scenes where Lawrence sits in the desert just feeling the sand,is so captivating.Lawrence faces such horrors of war that we can feel it through his eyes.The love for the desert makes him to change into something that he was meant to be.A legend.Truly for some men nothing is written until they write it.Though on personal fronts he would have suffered a lot in the desert & in Arabia.That has been wonderfully shown in the film.Still i feel the last scene,where Lawrence is going back to England & just sees Arabs on camels on his way.He feels again that he belongs here.And with the memorable soundtrack the movie closes.Thats so beautiful.David Lean has directed an epic here.This is the best movie of the century.This can never be emulated.This movie is just too difficult to surpass.I doubt i will ever see a movie better than this.",Lawrence of Arabia

There are excellent performances by Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and many, many more!  I also love Claude Rains in one of his later roles as Dryden.This movie is a classic, and as far as dealing with World War I, it's as great as ""All Quiet on the Western Front"".

189,Barky44,"Classic, Epic Fillmmaking",9,29 August 2006,"I have finally sat down to watch the entirety of Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean's 1962 classic film.Watching this film, it is easy to see how today's epic films (from Braveheart to Lord of the Rings) owes so much to David Lean's brand of storytelling. This film is a lesson in how to make an epic film. He sets the standard and shows us how it's done.The cinematography in LoA is absolutely stunning. Shot setups are superb, and the beauty of the photography belies the fact that desert shootings represent some of the worst possible lighting conditions. And Lean really uses the scenery, the desert setting is really a character in the film. Shot choices in this film have been used in other desert films ever since, you cannot help but say ""Oh, they copied this shot for Hidalgo"" as you watch this film.The action sequences are also superbly shot and exciting. Again, David Lean sets the standard for such sequences, and without all the high-tech gadgetry available today. The cavalry charge on Aqaba show real mastery on the part of the wranglers and stunt coordinators, as does the train attack. This action seems ""toned down"" by today's standards, but is perfect for this film: it is exciting to watch but does not distract the viewer from the story or the key characters.For it's not all about the epic, it's really all about the characters (in this case, Peter O'Toole's T.E. Lawrence). Lean doesn't forget this film is about this character, and does a great job keeping that focus, and not getting lost in the vastness of the scenery. Clearly this is O'Toole's movie, he does a great job portraying the transformation from slightly arrogant but thought-provoking lieutenant to the fractured war hero known as Lawrence of Arabia. This is O'Toole's first major work, yet it seems he was built for the role. He does it brilliantly. Clearly he had something to prove, and prove it he did.I only have mild criticism for this film. First of all, Alec Guinness as Arab Prince Faisal was really bad casting. Sir Guinness is one of the greatest actors of all time, but I found his performance here distracting, not embellishing. It's not one of his better performances, he seems to try to hard to be Arab, but can't hold it together.I also found the musical cues out of place at certain times. Maurice Jarr's score is striking, and did set the tone for all desert pictures since, but not all the cues work well. Sometimes the music is overdone for no reason, and other scenes call for music where there is none. Film scores have advanced since that time, and credit should be given to a pioneer in the epic score, but it was still distracting at times.Otherwise, this is a top-notch film, and a must-see for fans of epic film-making.9 out of 10 Barky",Lawrence of Arabia
190,RIK-22,Made no sense.,4,16 December 2020,"This came out on a 4k Blu Ray, so thought I would give this classic a chance, I never saw it before, so did not know what to expect.Obviously, this film is of a certain age and so I adjusted my expectations for that.The film is literally split into 2 parts, with an intermission in the middle.The first part of the film is quite slow and boring, lots of wondering the desert with some beautiful camera shots and epic scenes, so still okay to watch.However, the second half of the film makes no sense at all, it just jumps from place to place. The acting or rather the massive over-acting from Peter O'Toole is terrible. There are lots of weird close-ups of Lawrence, looking sweaty and constipated, no idea what this is trying to convey. One minute he is supporting the British, mumbling some meaningless drivel then seconds later is supporting the Arabs, again, not making any sense with his lines, then he is having doubts about everything.The whole flow of the film breaks down, there are jumps to scenes with no reason, making it almost impossible to work out what is going on and why. The Arab contingent for some unknown reason are now totally dependent on Lawrence, which is not explained or rational, based on the scene's I was watching. Lawrence who was always a bit flaky, now goes full camp drama-queen, which would not inspire anyone, however the supporters view him as a messiah. The film then suddenly ends, with no real meaning or pathos, just ends.I can only assume the film makers overstretched themselves and either could not get the script together or the money or just had enough, as the last hour of the film goes nowhere and does not seem to make any sense.",Lawrence of Arabia

Everyone in the cast even the soldiers do a great job. There is moments throughout the film where you will wonder how they did something so perfectly. This films name has also been attached to the word epic. Everything in this film is huge. The battles, the desert, everything. The writing is fantastic, and is amazingly based of real events.

194,Pratik112,Top Class Movie,10,6 November 2006,"I first saw this movie in the cinemas in the late 1960's and was very much glued to the screen and thoroughly enjoyed it.Based on the time that TE Lawrence spent in Arabia, the movie unusually begins with him getting on his motor bike and minutes later he has an accident is killed. Then comes the back flash and his time in Arabia during the desert conflict during the First World War.Filmed almost entirely in Jordan, the movie has some brilliant piece of cinema photography which can only be enjoyed in the cinemas to see the full effect, brilliant acting by Peter O' Toole - it was his first movie, as well as by all the others including Omar Sheriff and Alec Guiness. The music score by Maurice Jarre is well supportive to the movie and especially where the Arabic style is concerned as is the script by Robert Bolt. And finally, what can be mentioned about the director, the late David Lean except he is excellent.Conclusion: Nowadays we don't get to see such classic movies in a cinema. For the simple reason is that they don't make them anymore.

196,Kakueke,Lean's masterpiece,10,22 September 2001,"A masterpiece of cinematography and screenplay, Lawrence of Arabia will always be an all-time classic.  Although movies preceding the early 60s could sometimes bring out some negative qualities in a looked-up-to historical figure, this one was fairly unique at the time in bringing out specifically the disturbing side, as well as the heroic stature.   The latter is not deemphasized either, even as Lawrence's more ordinary moral conflicts become apparent.  Anyway, the overall screenplay, so well-written, is in itself as worthy a focus as the individual character of Lawrence.  The film serves as a bit of a ""Ball Four"" (yes, I emphasize ""a bit"") to later negative movie commentaries on war and political intrigues.  And as to visuals, the desert becomes as beautiful a place as the sea, the mountains, the forests, and the sky.  As one who considers ""Lawrence"" an all-time favorite, I will nevertheless acknowledge that it drags a bit in both the first and second halfs.  Ultimately, tho, the story justifies the length and all the scenes.

197,pswanson00,"""Extending beyond the usual or ordinary, especially in size or scope.""",10,28 March 2005,"My ""Summary"" is one of the definitions of Epic, and it applies to this film perhaps more than any other. The life of T.E. Lawrence is shown as few other men have ever been presented. Born Thomas Edward Chapman, the bastard son of Thomas Chapman and Sarah, the governess of his children, the man we know as T.E. Lawrence rose from what could have been the lowest possible social circumstances to become the best-known English-speaking warrior of his time. How much of his fame is deserved, and how much is due to the publicity generated by the newsreels of Lowell Thomas is hard to say now, but there is no denying that Lawrence was an extraordinary man. David Lean was an equally extraordinary filmmaker. As the reader may've guessed, I'm a student of the life of Lawrence, inspired as a young teenager by seeing this movie. I now know that the movie is not a precisely-accurate historical document, but it imparts the basic chronology of the best-known era of Lawrence's life, as well as a feel for the nature of the man. His physical appearance -- 5'6"" and plain of face -- was nothing like the handsome, 6-foot Peter O'Toole, but he clearly possessed at least some of the personal flair ascribed to him in this film. Creation of the film was a monumental task, with much of the filming occurring in temperatures exceeding 125 degrees Fahrenheit (!!). The crew had to invent ways to cool the cameras, to keep the film from being destroyed by heat before it was processed. The fact that the crew's shared suffering resulted in this excellent film and not mass murder is a tribute to the director. I won't rhapsodize about the cast, the scenery, the sheer mass of people required to make Lawrence of Arabia, I'll just sum up with this: this is an all-time great film, and should be seen by everyone. That's it.",Lawrence of Arabia
198,Kubris,In the desert...,9,29 December 2011,"IMDb Top 250: 54Continuing my David Lean unit, I devoted an afternoon to watching Lawrence of Arabia: one of the most iconic, legendary, and celebrated films of all time. Widely regarded as Lean's masterpiece, I was really excited: The Bridge on the River Kwai exceeded my expectations. The number one 'Epic' movie according to the AFI, I expected a roaring tribute to success, an aura of victory and grand scale, and lots of sand. I got 2 of those.Lawrence of Arabia follows Lawrence's life during World War I, with one scene after his death. Right from the start there's something different about the film: for 4 minutes, there is no picture, only sound- the overture prepares you for the atmosphere of the desert, and for the nearly 4 hour journey ahead. The first scene is very interesting, and anyone who knows any history won't consider it spoilers: after his crash, the viewer objectively sees Lawrence's funeral. There, reporters ask people about him, and they call him a great man- but almost none have actually met him. By showing his funeral first, a viewer doesn't fear for Lawrence's safety throughout the film: we can focus on his character and his actions.From there, there is a hard cut to many years previous, and the adventure that is the middle eastern theatre of WWI begins. The Middle East is an interesting setting, virtually unexplored by Western film. In this film, we see enough of it to make up for the deficiency. We also learn about the belligerents of the conflict, Arabs who unite to displace the Turkish, who Lawrence describes as ""silly people"" who will be small until they can stop arguing between their tribes.Lawrence had a fascinating life that makes for a great story, but it's good that we only see the WWI section of it: the film couldn't be any more sprawling without losing all cohesion. The film takes its time, and that's something critical to a viewers enjoyment of the film. We see Lawrence trekking through the desert a lot. The length of the film is quite daunting, but it never feels slow, because of the sweeping scenery and fantastic soundtrack. The pace is like a jog: it never really quickens, even in battle, but there's always the sense that movement is happening.Arabia jumps from scene to scene like a roller-coaster. There are sequences of talk, then walking through the desert, then a battle, followed by talking... it covers all the bases. Great scenes include Ali's entrance, Aqaba, and the massacre (a surprisingly dark scene). For such an epic film, I expected more depth to the battles. They are skimmed over, and one key fight isn't even shown at all!If there's one thing I've learned so far from this unit, it's that David Lean can shoot a beautiful film. Lawrence of Arabia has the most stunning photography, I dare call it the perfect visual film. Be it desert in every direction, canyons, huge camps, horses charging to a city, or just the sun, this has the most massive scale in film. It's a shame, and one cannot stress this enough, that this film as of December 2011 does not exist on Blu Ray.Equal to the visual is the audio. The music is perfect for the desert, with a sweeping band playing the overture that has middle eastern flair. The sound effects are brilliant, like the wind, explosions, or even the sound of the heat of the sun.Lean does a very good job of directing. This film has a marginally larger scale than Bridge on the River Kwai, but loses the focus that film had. However, as your teachers once taught you, quantity does not equal quality, and in this case, grand does not instantly equate to great: I can't just love the movie because it's so big.Finally, the acting. Unless you live under a rock, Lawrence's portrayal, and his character in general, is legendary. In his tour-de-force, Peter O'Toole (I was shocked this was his first major film) portrays the outspoken and impulsive Lawrence. His motives are complicated, he is a difficult to understand person. *******SPOILERS FOR A 50 YEAR OLD MOVIE******* Over the course of the film, he develops, at first for the better, but then he deteriorates. His ego gets the better of him, and he finds himself in a terrible situation. This situation, in which he is implicitly raped, is far too vague, even for the 60's. What makes that worse is that it is a key part of his development, and would be far easier to understand if even a small visual cue was added. In the end, he goes home dejected, a failure to himself, despite being a hero of the people. This is a central theme I picked out, which is the myth vs. man. Ironically,the whole film represents that theme. Perhaps things happened Lawrence didn't write about, and we see only the good and (perhaps) relatively bad. ***END SPOILERS***The film has good support, but it is clearly O'Toole's show. You can learn a lot about someone through their interactions, and the point of the film is to learn about Lawrence. Hence, Sharif Ali is Lawrence's closest friend. We see their initial conflict, gaining of respect, and relationship. Through Ali, we see when Lawrence's fragile mental state is apparent.Where Bridge on the River Kwai was about the waste of war, this is about the glory of war- until it's not. As Lawrence says, ""Nothing is written"", sadly ironic for the passionate young man.I don't think a film like this will ever be made again. Not at this scale, not at this length. Unlike many biographical films, LoA leaves in the true ending, with his rise and fall. Despite the unhappy end, Lawrence of Arabia is a spectacle of cinematic achievement. 9.1/10",Lawrence of Arabia
199,joelgodinho,The Ultimate War Epic,10,3 October 2020,"Lawrence Of Arabia is a classic 1962 Epic directed by David Lean and starring Peter O'Toole, Omar Shariff and Anthony Quinn.This is easily one of the most acclaimed works in the history of film, it has a very above average score of 8.3/10 on IMDb, it's one of the very few films to get a perfect 100 metascore and it's even featured on the Sight an Sound poll of the 100 greatest films of all time, nearly everyone loves this film! Me included, and how could you not? It's so damn perfect in almost every single aspect that I can think of.The performances are magnificent, Peter O'Toole seems to have been made to be T. E. Lawrence on the big screen, this strange and unusual but charismatic and fascinating character, he portraits him so well that I could never imagine any other actor replacing him in, let's say a remake (I really hope they never do that to this film but apparently they're doing it to Don't Look Now and The Wild Bunch so it seems that nothing is sacred anymore), it might be one of the best casting choices of all time, at least in my opinion. But O'Toole is obviously not the only grear actor, far from it, Omar Shariff is fantastic and so is Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn and Claude Rains, the whole cast is magnificent and the dialogue is some of the most memourable that I have heard.The cinematography is remarkable, never has the desert been so well captured in a movie, this film has some of the most beautiful shots I have ever seen, my personal favourite probably being when Lawrence saves Gasim and Daud races to get to them. This also has one of the single greatest and most unforgettable edits in the history of cinema, when Lawrence blows out a match, cutting to the sunrise in the desert, it is impossible to put to words how beautiful of a transition that is and it will probably be the things that I will most remember from this film.And the score, the score!! To say it's majestic would be to seriously underrate it. Everytime I think of Arabia or even simply the desert, one of the first things that comes to mind is this masterpiece of a score. Easily top 15 best of all time in my opinion.Oh, and I would also like to say that the costumes in the film are great as well, the one worn by Lawrence in particular is iconic.In short this film is a masterpiece that made me come back to it less than a week after watching it for the first time, can't put to words how much I would like to see it in on the silver screen and could not recommend it more.10/10.",Lawrence of Arabia
200,IndustriousAngel,A feast for the eyes,7,1 July 2013,"This film features some of the best cinematography ever done, you really get the feeling for the vast expanse of the landscape, the heat of the desert. The scene where Lawrence returns from the desert, slowly appearing, first only as a speck, in the boiling air - brilliant and not a second too long. And you can't beat hundreds of extras running and riding through giant sets. (btw, there are some blue-screen shots with o'Toole and Sharif on camel-back, those don't ring true) Peter O'Toole is amazing, but I have to disagree about many of the other roles - OK, it was a different time, but some of the performances were plain cheesy or over-the-top, even Olivier and Sharif. Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters. Not a film I'd watch very often, but definitely worth the money if you can catch it on a big screen, preferably a 70mm copy.

The key dramatic elements are simple: what draws you in to the story is the relationship between two characters that are seemingly so opposite and arrive from such different background that putting them together in the story is like watching a high school chemistry experiment run amok; you are aware of the dangers involved in their pairing, know that while neither is safe around each other, that neither can ever fully trust another, you don't care and want to watch their relationship unfold until the very end.

203,wandereramor,The grand-daddy of all biopics,7,15 October 2011,"If we're in the mood to do film genealogies, and I am, then Lawrence of Arabia is probably the inventor of the modern biopic, the perennial awards-bait genre. (You could maybe posit Citizen Kane as the originator, but that's really a different kettle of fish.) It examines a fairly recent historical figure at the prime of their life, dedicating numerous scenes and most of the dialogue to hammering home that the central character is a Very Special Person Unlike His Short-Sighted Bosses, and in this way the film spends a good amount of time justifying itself. This genre obviously has strengths and flaws, and they're apparent in Lawrence: the striking personal power as well as the kind of historical oversimplification and tourism that goes along with it.Lawrence of Arabia's main claims to being a great film are David Lean's gorgeous cinematography, stopping the action at several points simply to capture the desert in all its cold grandeur, and the film's final hour, in which Peter O'Toole turns his larger-than-life hero into a desperate, wild-eyed man who can no longer control the violence he's created. The biggest points against it are its indulgent four-hour running time and its unavoidable racism (having two of its major Arab characters played by white actors in brownface is really one of the lesser offences.) With this in mind, it's hard to say whether a contemporary viewer will really enjoy this film. I found it fitfully interesting but ultimately had trouble engaging with it, and felt kind of exhausted by the film. On the other hand, I've been told that it needs to be seen on a big screen for true appreciation, and not my modest laptop monitor, so I don't want to say anything definitive. Whether or not it ""holds up"", Lawrence of Arabia is a pioneering movie that manages, despite everything, to capture a kind of beauty, and that makes it worth slogging through for anyone genuinely interested in film.",Lawrence of Arabia
204,basilisksamuk,I was right the first time,1,20 May 2012,"I had a bad experience with Lawrence of Arabia when I was a lad (the film that is, not the person). I still have vivid memories of sitting through this interminable film and over forty years later still remembered it as the distilled essence of boredom. It can't possibly be as bad as I remember, I told myself. I must have been too young to appreciate it at the time. Still somehow I never got around to trying it again.Recently I acquired a box set of David Lean films running from his first as director, In Which We Serve, through to Hobson's Choice in 1954. All the films had some restoration work done to them and they all looked good. In fact I wasn't prepared for just how good some of the films were. Of course, I was familiar with Brief Encounter and Great Expectations, both as good as ever but I wasn't prepared for just how good all the rest were. Passionate Friends is similar in some ways to Brief Encounter to my eyes a much more adult treatment of the issues than the rather soppy, though irresistible, Brief Encounter. Oliver Twist quite took my breath away with its cinematography and Robert Newton's portrayal of Bill Sykes, a singularly chilling performance which is far more disturbing than the anaemic serial killers we see in more recent films. It was all looking promising then for a reappraisal of Lawrence of Arabia. Even so the DVD sat unwatched on a shelf for several months, so bad was my memory of the original experience of seeing it. Eventually the fateful day arrived (well two days to tell the truth as I stopped at the original intermission and resumed the next day).So, was it any better than my memories suggested? Not much. At least I knew a little more about the history than I did before and could find something interesting from that point of view. But otherwise it was every bit as bombastic, boring and ennui-inducing as I had found it originally. On IMDb I see that the average score is 8.6 and it ranks at number 42 in the top 250 so someone clearly likes it. Here's why all those people are wrong: 1 The film has been praised for its cinematography, particularly the desert photography. I'll agree that there are some good shots but they aren't that great. If I want desert shots I can see much better by buying the box set of ""Life"" and watching the episode on deserts. In fact I can find a dozen BBC series, usually in High Definition and usually narrated by David Attenborough which outstrip anything in Lawrence. If you like desert shots my advice would be get the documentaries instead and turn off the sound so you aren't disturbed by Attenborough droning on and on. In fact play some good desert music like Tinarewen in the background, turn the central heating up and refuse to drink water for 24 hours for a really good effect.2 The majority of the film is taken up by Lawrence seemingly crossing deserts in real time. This is both boring and pointless as a filmic experience. An alternative would be to try (1) above.3 The theme tune – you know, the one you can't get out of your head even if you try, occurs exactly when and where you think it will, usually signalling another real time trek across another bloody desert (or back again). At least you can enliven your viewing experience by predicting when the theme tune will come back in – I guarantee you'll get it right every time.4 The action scenes all run left to right (or is it right to left, I forget). There's a reason for this which I also forget but bores on IMDb can explain it to you. Despite the huge numbers of extras, camels etc employed it generates some really unimpressive battle scenes when you start to notice the left-to-rightness of the action.5 I've not read any of T.E. Lawrence's original writing but I'd be very surprised to learn he was such a crashing, pompous bore and bigot as the portrayal in this film suggests. The character in the film is so deeply unlikable as to immediately nullify my suspension of disbelief. My mind keeps interrupting my concentration as it asks how anyone can be inspired to follow this idiot.6 Many say that Peter O'Toole's portrayal is magnetic, compelling, heroic and so on in this film. I say his acting suggests that he is completely bewildered by what the character is supposed to be like so he's just settled for acting mad and unpleasant whilst staring distractedly into space.7 Goggles on a bush. How much more obvious and clichéd can you get? 8 So that's where Alec Guinness got his inspiration for Obi-Wan Kenobi? 9 Coming in at just under 47 hours in length this film is just too long. Simply taking out Omar Sharif's entrance scene would trim 24 hours from the running time. Ideally a ninety minute cut would be just about watchable.It wouldn't be cricket to not mention the good points of the film as well and they can be summarised in just two words – Claude Rains.",Lawrence of Arabia
205,samyaksambuddha,Purely a classic,9,22 June 2018,"This movie revolves around the journey of an English official who is sent to Arabia due to his uncompliant attitude. But story takes a turn when Lawrence bypasses the superior orders and makes his own path towards unification of the Arabs.
Peter O's Toole who plays T.E. Lawrence, who played a decisive role in unifying the divided Arab tribes. The personality of Lawrence is a complicated one that makes watching the movie interesting. Till the far end it is difficult to understand the side that Lawrence takes. Peter has done a pretty commendable job while portraying Lawrence's personality. Based on true events, the movie too is directed and plated on a realistic note moving the viewer experience the trials that desert life offers while at the same time the dark face and politics of the colonial powers. Lawrence is a compassionate person yet he has to kill out of unprecedented circumstances. A time comes when the entire Arab follows Lawrence but he is not one to use it. Rather, he works inherently towards unification. Disobeying the superior orders, he maintains the dignity of the local people while trying to solve their problems through dialogue. He plays a crucial role in helping Prince Feisel conquer Gulf of Aqaba through the land route.
The movie has philosophical elements that make you think about a certain event but then on a deeper thought only praise takes it's way out. Purely a classic making it a top 20 list even after more than half a century.",Lawrence of Arabia
206,Don-102,This is what an Epic is supposed to be - absorbing AND audacious.,10,20 March 1999,"There were all kinds of huge Hollywood productions in the 50' and 60's, beginning with 1952's THE ROBE.  Their common traits were that they were mostly biblical or Roman in theme, ran well over 3 hours, and were shot in CinemaScope or Super Panavision 70, both massive wide-screen processes. LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is not biblical, nor is it an ancient Roman story.  It is a 20th Century account of one man's personal fight to change the face of history and third world politics.  It is far better than the films of the previous mold, because it is far more believable and timeless.  We may not learn much about T.E. Lawrence as a man, but his actions and incredible ambition tell us a lot.  The monumental look of the film does not overshadow our involvement in Lawrence's plight and we do care for this strange, intelligent little man who may have become a God to his Arab counterparts, and, to himself.David Lean is a great director, period.  This man takes his cast and crew to excruciating locales (BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI - jungle, LAWRENCE- the middle of one of the largest deserts in the world).  The desert, ""the anvil of the earth"" states Omar Sharif as Ali,  is as much a character in the flick as any actor.  This is not a criticism.  You will NEVER see such rigorous performances in the most horrific of earthly conditions.  Lean and co. spent over 2 years out there making this amazing picture and it shows. Peter O'Toole's appears to grow older and wiser as the film moves along (and it moves along at a refreshingly fast pace for a 4 hour epic).  He is perfectly cast to play a mysterious historical figure, a man who was reportedly gay, a topic that could not be tackled on-screen at the time. There are 2 hints I found, however.  See if you can find them, especially in one scene with Jack Hawkins.  His mission to observe the Arabian efforts during WWI turn aggressive, until it eventually consumes his very being. This is personal to Lawrence.  He becomes Lawrence of Arabia because he wants his place in history and he wants to ""give these people their freedom"".  We, in essence, are no longer observers, but become entrenched with Lawrence's fight.The mind-boggling cinematography is so rich and dry, we feel like getting a drink whenever possible.  The night-time shots are as awe-inspiring as the day shots.  The blowing sand over the rigid desert suggests the winds of change about to happen in Saudi Arabia.  The first half of  picture is a bit slower than the second, but my favorite sequence occurs.  Lawrence, against all human odds, goes back to the heart of the desert to save 'Gasim', risking all he is fighting for, as well as his own life. He teaches the Arabs that nothing is ""written"", and Lawrence truly wrote his own history almost single-handedly.  Later, he has an unexpected, yet necessary duty, to perform with the very man he saved.  The blinding sun shots and look of the actors in these conditions contribute to the realism of the picture.Serious film buffs must see LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, because of its influential importance.  Steven Spielberg claims to watch it before he starts every new project.  It is all over RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The sheer grandness of its look and feel will change your cinematic values.  It demands viewing because it is the cinema in its purest form.NOTE: This is another wide-screen format must.  It is not even worth seeing without it.  Lawrence's victorious trot across the wrecked train, probably the most celebrated sequence, cannot even be seen in its proper perspective in pan and scan.",Lawrence of Arabia

The film follows the World War One escapades of the eponymous Lawrence as he fights for the Arabs, and struggles across miles of desert.There are so many people to be credited for the brilliance of this film, the film that is Steven Spielberg's favourite film of all time. Peter O'Toole's performance is incredible. He brings a mixture of arrogance, humanity and terrifying insanity to his performance. He is brilliantly supported by all of the cast but chiefly by Guinness, Quinn, Sharif and Quayle, who all produce performances of fantastic calibre.There is also Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson who produced a fantastic script which create so many layers for the enigmatic central layers. Then there is F.A. Young's spectacular cinematography, which is quite probably the most beautiful that has ever been produced. There is also Maurice Jarre's brilliantly memorable score with one of the most famous themes that has ever been composed.But the one person who is to be acclaimed the most for this wondrous achievement is the director, David Lean. His control of this fantastic picture is outstanding and his resultant creation is unbelievable.A true achievement, spectacular and a must see, Lawrence of Arabia will blow you away.",Lawrence of Arabia

210,robert-259-28954,The greatest epic ever filmed... period.,10,6 January 2014,"Very few pictures can truly be called, ""epic,"" and few have worn the title so well for so long. It seems the older this film gets, the better it gets, on every conceivable level. May I start by saying that this movie could NOT have been made today. The sheer budgetary concerns, combined with the fact that no studio wants a picture this long, this deliberately slowly-paced, and one that cannot be made into a video game or sequels for prepubescent teenagers. Every great film requires greatness on every level, and this one fulfills that contract in spades - the locations, the actors, the script, the direction, the story itself - all larger than life. But particular attention should be paid to the casting, first-rate from top to bottom. No studio today would have taken a chance on using a relatively green actor as O'Toole in such a role! His choice was truly inspired. And the supporting cast, well, let's just say that it utilized the very best talent alive at the time, perhaps ever. Particularly a star turn by a superb and restrained Alec Guinness as Faisal, another great performance by the always powerful Anthony Quinn, even an underrated job by Arthur Kennedy, who's strong and believable all-American characters seem to capture the spirit of Americans like none other (he's seldom given the credit he deserves). Claude Raines was wonderful as the stoic, tongue-in-cheek politician, and in the twilight of his career, a fitting monument to his accomplishments. And can we forget the short but powerful scene by Mel Ferrer as the Turkish commandant? He's the reason they say, ""It's not the size of the part, but the talent of the actor."" At first, he turned down the 15-minute part, but we are all the better for it that he agreed. But in the end, this project belongs to the legendary David Lean, who's magnificent vision was only equaled by that of T.E. Lawrence himself.",Lawrence of Arabia
211,metalrox_2000,One of the greatest epics ever.,10,23 March 2011,"How does one make a film about a figure that just as many felt was a hero, as felt was a villain. That was the question posed to one of the greatest directors in American cinematic history, David Lean.Strangely, the film starts off with the death of Lawrence in a motorcycle accident. We then see his funeral, complete pageantry befitting a man of Lawrence's accomplishments. And as one man tells a reporter that Lawrence was a great man, he takes no time to degrade Lawrence as the reporter walks away. This prompts an man eavesdropping to defend Lawrence, even though he only knew him through press clippings. And here is where the story begins.We find Lawrence at his beginnings, a rather average British solider given a rather average task. He spends most of his days sitting behind a desk, until he gets an assignment. One that calls for him to seek out Prince Fiesel, played by Alec Guiness in perhaps his greatest performance. Torn between two countries, Lawrence is caught between what he feels is loyalty to help a struggling people, and the orders from the military in his native land.Lawrence is a complex man who can be calm, and charismatically charming one moment, has shown in his concern for two orphans he takes under his wing, to a brutal man with the ability to kill without remorse.The film makes no apologies for Lawrence, painting a brutally honest picture on the man, and leaving the question to the audience. Was Lawrence a good man, or an evil one with dreams of being a God? Yes the film is 3 hours long, but take heart, there is actually a intermission in the film. However, this film is paced well, the story is interesting, Peter O'Toole, Omar Shariff, and Alec Guiness are all amazing performers who each give the best performance. In a small role as a ruthless dictator, Jose Ferrer, and Claude Rains, know for his role as Captain Louis Renault, plays the role of Mr. Dryden. An epic movie made from a Hollywood that has sadly faded away. This is one of the movies they are talking about when they say ""they don't make them like they used to.""",Lawrence of Arabia
212,georgioskarpouzas,unconventional imperialists,8,22 August 2006,"This movie has been the most praised movie by David Lean and is a favorite of Greek television which plays it every year especially during religious holidays. It is a memorable film and has many affinities with A passage to India in the sense that it presents the picture of an unconventional Briton who defying his prejudiced superiors sides with the native underdogs,underdogs from the point of view of the British of course, for, for their own people they are the elite. But differences exist: while Fielding in a passage to India makes a temporary alliance with a falsely accused Indian middle-class doctor, Lawrence forms meaningfull relationships with simple Arabs as the camel boys and the Arab whom he saves with danger of his life. Of course the main course of action is the relationship of the British agents with the indigenous ruling class. The movie is based on the life of a historical personnage T.E. Lawrence, a British archaeologist,spy, adventurer and larger than life personality.The historical veracity of the movie is questionable since as Steven Spielberg said in an interview, this movie genre is not a documentary but creative use of existent historical material- creative logistics comes to mind. Of course art always has to uplift the mundane realities of life, in that case of colonial power politics. As far as we know Lawrence was not the ardent arabophile the movie presents him to be and he was loyal to his country's imperial interests which did not identify with those of the Arabs, that is of the dynasty of Prince Feisal since no institutions as referendums were utilized to express the will of the average Arab, if such a life-form existed then. While the politics of the film is unreliable and murky, its' artistry is great with unforgettable performances of the major and minor protagonists of this drama that was the Arab Revolt.Lawrence, general Allenby, Prince Feisal, the hauitat chief Abu-tayi, the American journalist are all portrayed unforgettably, although I suspect that if one was to meet those personalities in private after having seen the movie(which of course is impossible) he would be disappointed. But of course the role of art is to create role models and icons not to copy mundane reality.",Lawrence of Arabia
213,williwaw,Masterpiece,10,25 July 2011,"Sam Spiegel who began his career as 'Sam P Eagle' reverted to his birth name and produced some of the greatest films of the 50's: The African Queen, The Wild One, Bridge On The River Kwai and Suddenly Last Summer. Spiegel's greatest triumph would come with this film in a new decade the 1960's. Columbia Pictures gave Spiegel's great discretion as he worked from London under his Horizon Film's banner. Stars like Brando, Hepburn, Bogart, Taylor, Clift, were in Speigel's films. Taking the story of T E Lawrence, Sam Spiegel once again joined forces with His great collaborator on The Bridge on River Kawi David Lean and together they made in my assessment the finest film of all time ""Lawrence Of Arabia"".Casting Peter O Toole after Marlon Brando declined the role, Lean and Spiegel created a worldwide star and to me O'Toole's Lawrence is the finest performance I have ever seen from an male star. (Gloria Swanson's Sunset Blvd gets my vote as best femme performance). O Toole while nominated lost the Oscar to Gregory Peck. (Jack Lemmon's searing Days of Wine And Roses was also nominated)Maurice Jarre created a memorable score, one of the best if not best ever. David Lean assembled a cast of Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn and in a star making performance, Omar Sharif.

If you need romance, don't watch this.But if you want a great story about a once-in-a-100-years character leading a (somewhat) miraculous story, then this is a must.Granted, there are zero, none, nada female characters in the whole film! That's right.This is in stark contrast to Lean's ""Hobson's Choice,"" starring the legendary Charles Laughton.Then again, ""Lawerence of Arabia"" is largely about war, and mostly about conniving men at war and politics.What none of them could ever have anticipated was ""El Lawrence,"" or as the Arab speakers called him ""Awrence.""The acting is top-shelf across the film: Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, and (crazy) Anthony Quinn among others.Rating: 9 (easy)",Lawrence of Arabia

Sometimes I think that line was crossed.I won't engage any of the anachronistic criticisms I see here. The film was made in a different time with different viewer expectations than those of our own. Deal with it. At the same time, yeah, the attitudes toward ""the natives"" are a bit much at points.I do feel sorry for the families of those who come off somewhat badly and were in real life much better people than the film allows.

218,hoxjennifer,"A great epic, best appreciated in more than 1 sitting",8,23 December 2014,"I first watched Lawrence of Arabia when I was about 10 years old with my parents. We had some sort of movie renting coupon from Rogers and were planning on nailing all the best picture films. I remember watching part I and II on separate days, and falling asleep both times because the movie was so long.Now, 11 years later, I've watched the full movie again. The full 3 hours and 30 minutes of this film can't be watched in one sitting for me. The long scenes of Lawrence and the Arabs trekking across the dessert are hard to watch and stay awake in, especially at night. This film is better appreciated in more than one sitting, and in sections.I think one of the major downfalls of this movie is that it is so long. But I'm noticing that this might have been some kind of trend in 60's epic cinema (2001: A Space Odyssey is a good example). The focus is more on showing dramatic and beautiful landscapes (considering when the movie was made, this is very impressive cinematography). Cutting out all those long scenes and focusing on the actual plot reveals a complex narrative of a complex man.Peter O' Toole gives a stunning performance as a transformed man after his experiences in the dessert. In Part I, he is a noble man, afraid of bloodshed, representing law and order. By Part II, he completes his descent into insanity, becoming bloodthirsty and damaged beyond repair. The tragic irony of all this is that his own ego is what led to his personal downfall, even though he is glorified in public opinion. One critique I've read is that Peter O'Toole's character is not an accurate representation of the real T.E. Lawrence, so if you're looking at this film from a historical standpoint it might not be enjoyable. But taking it as an epic exploring themes of loyalty, violence and adventure this really is a great story with incredible acting.",Lawrence of Arabia

The background music scored by Maurice Jarre added to the gravitas of making it one of the greatest films. The soundtracks are full of energy and kept resonating in my mind right from the time the movie commenced. Peter O'Toole portrayed T.E.Lawrence, a man often marred by controversy for his radical thinking and insouciance. T.E.Lawrence is shown as a man respected by his fellowmen after his contribution to the Arab league in the beginning of the movie and the movie shows his journey from Cairo to Aqaba and then to Damascus as a member of the British army. He's considered arrogant, extraordinary and sadistic by his colleagues but that doesn't stymie the aid, leadership in attacking the Turks and the invaluable counsel he provided the Arabs . The movie is a landmark in every single aspect right from the geographical location of filming. I still contemplate over how few scenes were shot, especially the one in which the Arabs blast a railway track and all the horses aboard are set free.It is one of the movies i sat and watched with inquisitiveness and enjoyed thoroughly, albeit many complain about the running time of the movie. The cinematography is a treat to sore eyes. There couldn't be a better movie in terms of being a complete amalgam of War, Adventure, Drama and History.

This movie was directed by David Lean who also won an academy award for ""The bridge over the river kwai"". What both these movies have in common is a grand scope and an eye for detail that is unparalleled in most movies. The movie has one problem it is 3 hours and 35 minute before the final credits start. It is only a big deal if you are planning to watch it in one sitting, but in general it doesn't play long. The long slow scenes don't play so because you really are brought into those seemingly infinite deserts and feel the struggle for survival experienced by the characters.

Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war.Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence (""T.E"" get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other.Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery.The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film.The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection.If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic.

226,Chuck-149,Lawrence changes personality a little too radically,7,6 July 1999,"I enjoyed this movie but not as much as others.  I think the first problem with it is that Lean spent too much time showing us Lawrence's character.  What I mean is that instead of showing only the non-violent side of Lawrence he also shows us his nice and polite English man side which didn't have such a major role in the picture.  Personally, I thought Anthony Quinn and Jack Hawkins were really the ones who controlled the movie and gave that nice smooth flow.  The fighting scenes in the desert are excellent and so is the acting, directing, filming, and story.I have to say that this is an excellent movie and the reason I it enjoyed a little less than others is probably all a matter of taste.  However, I have to recommend this movie-classic to any movie lover.",Lawrence of Arabia
227,CinefanR,"Spectacular, fascinating character study. The Legend lives on",10,14 March 2012,"They don't make screens big enough for a movie like this. Hell, they don't make Actors like these anymore... Being born in the 80's, I must have seen ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in my childhood but didn't understand what the fuss was all about (except for Peter O'Toole's beauty and intense radiance). I have reluctantly revisited it recently. It took me several viewings to fully appreciate it, and it's probably the greatest movie ever made. Much has been said about this film, and usually people who have something to criticize are getting into pissing contests over its historical accuracy. I couldn't care less about those ""controversies"", they are missing the point. This is a fictionalized account, not a history lesson. I'm only interested in Peter O'Toole's Lawrence and the way this particular story is told. Historically accurate or not, I don't care. Not only ""Lawrence of Arabia"" hasn't aged one day, but it's light years ahead of recent productions. Cinematic perfection is what it is, and it's a miracle. There must have been a rare star alignment 50 years ago, that made everything click so perfectly - cast, acting, script, music, editing, scenery, costumes, all within a remarkable direction. Every scene is an invaluable lesson of filmmaking, a demonstration of superlative acting. What strikes me is that sensitive issues like sexual identity and violence are beautifully explored with a subtlety, intelligence and elegance that are no longer to be found in film today. I'm afraid to imagine how the ""Deraa sequence"" would be depicted these days. Filmmakers today just lack the talent and sensitivity to make it compelling without resorting to obscenity and gore for cheap shock value. Peter O'Toole is splendid, sophisticated,larger-than-life, and leaves you breathless with every movement. You will notice the subtle touches of his performance, the nuances of his ambiguous identity, constantly shifting. The portrayal of Lawrence is somewhat inconsistent, inexplicit, and he remains a fascinating puzzle, which is both frustrating and also the key to the movie's overall success. You will be blown away by the power of Lean's imagery and his ability to define a character so precisely and memorably through purely visual means. There's no CGI, so everything looks and feels real. But it feels real mostly because we see the alien Arab world through Lawrence's eyes. It's amazing how introspective, how personal such a grand-scale epic can be. So who is O'Toole's Lawrence? What is it that drives him to do what he does? I still don't know, but with each viewing there's something new to discover. I believe that David Lean's respect for the mystery, for the ineffable of human personality is something to be admired. But it's more than respect, it's Lean's intelligence that prevents him from ""explaining"" Lawrence. That's why people are still crazy about this movie 50 years later.",Lawrence of Arabia

""Lawrence of Arabia"" is no exception, and for all the brilliant work that was put into making the film, it was all undone in taking 222 minutes to view it. If Lawrence could fit into 120-150 minutes, we would have had a winner. For Lawrence ""6.5 out of 10""",Lawrence of Arabia
230,tjgoalie13,One of the Best Epics of All-Time,10,22 October 2015,"Lawrence of Arabia is a classicist Epic directed by David Lean, and starring Peter O'Toole as the titular character T.E. Lawrence. In many ways Lawrence of Arabia exemplifies an Epic, but what may be most impressive about the film is it's use of character development and themes. Lawrence of Arabia may be the best epic of all time, because it is grand in scope, long but never boring, and beautiful to look at. It truly is a masterpiece.When one thinks of what defines an epic, they could point to Lawrence of Arabia as a perfect example, it literally sets the standard. For example Lawrence of Arabia contains many Extreme Wide Shots of a vast panoramic landscape, this is one of the most recognizable elements of a epic, reinforcing how large in scope the story is. Most epics deal with stories that have a sense of spectacle, and therefore use these huge landscapes to show that, Lawrence of Arabia does that as well as any other film.Set against the Arabic dessert, which lends itself to large panoramic landscape shots, the audience is treated to seeing a beautiful picture, and in the middle we see these characters trying to navigate their way through it all. The film liked to use mostly wide shots, so much so that when they use a close up, it truly feels like it has meaning. On top of that Lawrence of Arabia contains some of the most luxurious set designs, and costumes of the time. High production values is of course is another common element of an epic, but the most impressive thing about Lawrence of Arabia is the pacing and the character development.At almost four hours it's hard to imagine a film that wouldn't feel long, but somehow Lawrence of Arabia manages not to. This is most likely because the themes and characters are both relatable, but also larger than life in some ways. Seeing a normal man navigate his way through massive desserts, and through foreign cultures may make him seem larger than life, but to his core the film keeps Lawrence human, so the audience never feels detached from him.The film deals with age old themes such as the ""fish out of water"" theme, which is used quite often, but arguably never better than in this film. As with most of the best films, the story and character development is mostly visual. In the beginning we quickly see how out of place Lawrence is, as we see his Arab escort shot for stealing water, Lawrence is outraged, as to him killing is taboo, and water is a common commodity, yet to the Arab culture, Water is so precious it's worth killing for. As the film goes on Lawrence learns the cultural difference, and learns not to treat other cultures as barbaric, because to them he is the barbarian.Utilizing beautiful grandeur Lawrence of Arabia still stands as one of, the best epics of all time, and a true masterpiece of cinema. Embodying all of the characteristics of a classic epic film Lawrence of Arabia is truly impressive because of it's masterful pacing and character development. It truly is an epic experience.",Lawrence of Arabia
231,Criticalstaff,Top Gun in the desert,2,5 March 2021,"It is clear that David Lean did know that indeed film is a visual medium. However it seems he was completely unacquainted to the fact that film is also a storytelling device. Filming sand is one thing, having characters or situations that you care about is another. This movie has gorgeous vistas of the desert and impressive battle sequences, but it also presents characters that are so badly characterized that it works against it. No character is likeable; they are all shortsighted, narrow-minded, vexatious individuals. That is basically the only real issue of the movie. I would argue that you need some kind of empathy in order to sit still for more than three hours, the movie offers none.It is somewhat of a relief to learn that the movie is an adaptation of Lawrence's memoirs, because I was wondering who wrote a script this badly. It is very bad, but it makes more sense when you realize they blindly transposed the story without connecting anything together, like with themes or motivations. The misunderstanding that a book and a movie should tell their story differently is, unfortunately, very common, but this film goes even further than that. It is further removed from reality and common sense.It is a film that does not understand what it shows us, except when it is the poetic beauty of the dunes. So much so, that thematically it ends up being exactly the opposite of what it purports to be. It results in a film that wants to be this epic romantic war tale, but ends up being a lousy adventure film. I am not entirely sure what it has to say about British Imperialism, but what is clear is that the Arabs are shown as barbaric savages. Even Omar Sharif's character, he is the closest to a well-defined character, with an arc and everything, is first shown as a cold-blooded savage. And maybe they are, I would not know, but the movie treats them visually as if they were the heroes and wants the audience to cheer for them while showing them being bad, ignorant or doing bad things.On that topic, one of the central, yet hidden, themes is homosexuality. On that aspect this movie is precisely like Top Gun: a war movie that is so macho and trying to be cool, that is becomes overtly gay. It is so ""dumb"" that you almost start to think it is parody. This film however cannot escape its own pretention; it could never play at parody.So gayness and being gay is kind central to this war movie for some reason. Lawrence is not explicitly gay; rather Lawrence is gay in what people in the sixties though gay people were. He likes to dress up; he has these weird relationships with boys. It's unsettling. But the biggest gripe I have is when we are explained that Ottomans sodomize their prisoners. Therefore, the movie argues, Arab fighters won't let themselves be captured and will prefer death to being left behind wounded. This is the type of characters, ideology, culture the movie asks us to root for.This is the movie for people who love to see sand, and for no one else.",Lawrence of Arabia
232,delightful-life,"This movie shows the same thing that's happening in the Arab word now, back in 1962!",10,21 July 2016,"History Repeats Itself...We are the stupidest people in the entire universe.This movie shows us two things: 1. How power corrupts and vanity ensures.2. How the Arab culture lends itself easily exploitable.And this is a fun movie too (it is a movie after all). There is subtle attention to detail all around, especially the expressions by the actors, you can read more from those than all the talking (just like in real life).Lawrence is a good man. A little vain, but good nonetheless. But put a person in an extreme circumstance and it changes him. Peter O'Toole's acting was too good. I could clearly feel what was going on in him. We who have lived out childhood days in a peaceful cultured society, can't cope with the brutality of war. Nowadays we have a lot of movies that show violence in graphic detail (The Revenant) to better make us understand a different world. This movie without showing the gore is able to tell us the 'why', so much more clearly. The story, editing, cinematography, everything is just that superb.I felt that this movie was at a higher level than even Shawshank Redemption. Relatively that is just a movie. And this one goes far beyond.I finished the move thinking of just one thing. We need to educate and culture our young from the smallest age to love and respect 'everyone'.

I really cant get the ""NO PRISONERS!"" quote out of my head, it's keeps me wanting more. I would've ranked this movie a 9.5/10 if it was possible. The main leading actor and supporting actor should have won an Academy Award for their role, especially for Best Costume Design. I would give it 10/10, but I found myself comparing this film to Ben-Hur(1959).

234,midge56,unbelievably Terrible & boring,2,11 July 2010,"I've loved all the other epics which came out. In fact, this is the first epic I've disliked. This movie was the most boring, uninteresting movie I have seen in 50+ years. I guess you would have to be one of those people who think a smashed soup can qualifies for modern art... in order to like this movie. Pretentious with no sense of genuine taste.Other than Alec Guiness and Omar Shariff, I didn't see any exceptional acting skills portrayed in this movie either. O'Toole's role came across as an idiotic, insincere dandy. I don't know which was worse... the actor's portrayal of the role of Lawrence or the writing of the dialogue and direction for his character.As for cinematography, most of the movie was showing the same section of the desert from different angles... over and over again... ad nauseum. Just look for the dark pyramid shaped mountain in nearly every scene.The entire movie and story positively bored me to tears. I can't think of a single redeeming moment or aspect of the entire movie. It might help a little if you read about TE Lawrence on Wikipedia before watching the movie... since the director filmed scenes out of context without explanation for those who were not familiar with the life and death of the main character... but that doesn't make it any less boring. When someone mentioned it was like watching paint dry... they weren't kidding. This movie is painfully boring from start to finish.I can see why this movie might have upset the Arabic audiences. The movie depicts Lawrence in a very lopsided view as the conquering hero leading confused, blundering minions. Not to say there weren't internal problems but deifying Lawrence as a superhero saint in this manner would have been insulting to any nation depicted under these conditions.But politics aside... this movie was painfully boring and doesn't do justice to anyone portrayed, including the title character. Perhaps if they had cut out about an hour and a half from the middle of the movie, it wouldn't have been as bad... but it needed some serious rewriting and new direction to make it tolerable.I really feel the most sorry for the crew and cast who had to endure the desert heat for over 2 years. No movie is worth subjecting that kind of hardship on anyone. Even these days, these egocentrical directors seem to think it is perfectly fine to place celebrities and stunt crews in terrible jeopardy and dangerous conditions just to make a movie... especially now when they have the option of using graphics and green screens instead. It reminds me of the 2006 remake of the Omen where they actually dropped a living person off the roof of the mansion with a noose around her neck... just to do a movie scene! What were these idiots thinking? That the audience would rather have a real person injured instead of a green screen or CGI? I realize we did not have CGI in 63, but they were able to superimpose scenes and use matte paintings and many other effects instead of having to drag the entire cast and crew into the sweltering desert... not to mention the dust in their lungs.Despite what the twisted minds of these megalomaniac directors think... the audience does not want their celebrities or anyone else to be injured or endangered just to make a movie... and that not only includes dangerous stunts... it also includes forcing them to endure sweltering heat or other horrible conditions which could have easily been avoided. That's how we lost actors like Clark Gable and John Candy as well as Jeffrey Hunter and Tyrone Power. Even on Lawrence of Arabia, O'Toole was nearly killed falling from the camel and Edmond O'Brien suffered a heart attack. Yet these kinds of travesties continue in filming movies today such as the stuntman for Harry Potter, now paraplegic because of a stunt which could have easily been done with green screen or CGI without a snap harness rigging required. When is someone going to stop these directors from subjecting our celebrities and crews to such harmful and dangerous conditions? It is a miracle that more actors did not die from the heat while making Lawrence of Arabia.Perhaps we can't do anything about a boring movie which is more than 47 years old, but we can start boycotting movies with crazed directors like this who insist on endangering cast and crew with dangerous stunts and harsh conditions. Perhaps they will get the hint when they fail to make money. A few protests wouldn't hurt either.But as far as this movie is concerned, I have thousands of movies in my personal library and none come close to being as boring as this movie. The closest I can come to it would be ""Stop the world, I want to get off"" as being as boring as this movie. Unless you are a fan of British military history or a WWI buff, I would not recommend this movie.",Lawrence of Arabia

There's a lot of great shots, scene changes and amazing attention to detail, all throughout the film.As a biopic, we really don't get to know the real life Lawrence that well. This is a my only minor criticism of the film. We do see highlights of where T.E. Lawrence was and what he did. With a running time of 3 1/2 hours, there was more than enough time available to get to know T. E. Lawrence in a more personal way.

236,writerasfilmcritic,An Excellent Effort on Many Levels,10,3 August 2006,"I won't try to compete with the superlatives of others and am less certain that this movie was the best flick of the 1960s. In that decade, American ""culture"" enjoyed a true renaissance, and our films were as much a reflection of it as was our music, our literature, and our science. As many good movies were made in a single year back then as have been made ever since, which is perhaps why Peter O'Toole didn't win the Academy Award for Best Actor --he had too much competition (Gregory Peck won it for ""To Kill a Mockingbird""). Obviously, however, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was one of the best movies of its time and one of the best movies ever made. To me, the real star of the movie was the Arabian Desert (although technically, it was filmed in Morrocco and Jordan). There was dramatic and arresting physical beauty in its sense of limitless space and its bleak, wind-whipped desolation. The dunes with their swirling sands, the dramatic barren mountains, and the isolated ridges far off in the distance yet easily visible all contributed to a dreamlike world. Perhaps even more important, and certainly more relevant to the theme, was the spiritual element inseparable from the vast emptiness of the broiling desert wilderness. The gorgeous and highly effective landscape photography firmly established the setting early in the film. Not unexpectedly, it was Lawrence's determination to leave the desert that signaled his eventual demise. His return ""home"" to England and the shallow, conventional life it offered led to the motorcycle accident that ultimately killed him. It seems he had ceased to follow his heart, perhaps because his experiences in Arabia, which had inspired him to greatness, had at the same time transformed him into someone he no longer believed in, understood, or felt he could keep living up to. By war's end, therefore, he seemed to have outlived his usefulness, if not so much to his Arab friends (who apparently worshiped him), than in his own mind. The outstanding performances by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn (and even Alec Guiness) threatened to upstage O'Toole's Lawrence, but he held his own and made the movie his. As such, it was probably the defining role of his career. It wasn't long, however, before Omar Sharif starred in ""Dr. Zhivago"" and Anthony Quinn in ""Zorba the Greek,"" no doubt these opportunities arising from their significant part in the making of ""Lawrence of Arabia."" After watching this movie again, I had a new sense of the Arab's plight, yet had to remind myself not to get carried away. The film was set during WWI, long before Israel became a country, and in that day, the Arabs were the oppressed people fighting for their independence from the Ottoman Empire, a civilization which at the time was well ahead of their own tribal existence and encroaching upon their seemingly cold and detached wilderness ethic. Much has changed since then. By the way, many years ago I had the opportunity to get a good look at a beautifully restored ""Bruff"" motorcycle (actually spelled b,r,o,u,g,h). That was the type that Lawrence owned and on which he had his fatal accident, shown in the opening sequence of the film. It looked to be all engine, with a surprising amount of horsepower for motorcycles of that era, which is why it was the fastest racing bike of its time.",Lawrence of Arabia

That's Debatable",8,30 October 2019,"There are way too many reviews here labeling this film as ""the greatest ever,"" ""perfect"" and/or containing similar such effusive praise. And while I can't argue with the cinematography (which truly is impressive), or the acting (++), there are a few issues I have with 'Lawrence of Arabia' that prevent me from joining others who want to put it on the highest shelf. Hear me out.Plot In a Nutshell: British officer T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) aids the Arab cause in their struggle against the Turks during the Great War.For starters, this is a flawed hero at best, and not an emotionally attractive one. It's easy to get behind the cause of Ben-Hur, for example, or Spartacus (which, by the way, are veritably epic films in their own right which preceded 'Lawrence of Arabia,' and which most reviewers here seem to have forgotten). Both Ben-Hur and Spartacus are wronged, we see it happen and we feel for the characters. Then they spend the rest of their films trying to right those wrongs, which they largely do. The same can be said for more recent epics like Braveheart and Maximus in 'Gladiator.' What exactly is so emotionally appealing about Lawrence? He hasn't been wronged in any way. He's just a soldier doing his job. OK. That's nice, but it lacks the powerful impact of Maximus getting revenge on Commodus or the slaves all standing up and saying ""I am Spartacus"" in a show of unity with that titular character. LOA just doesn't have this. There's no impetus to care about Lawrence as there is for the 'heroes' in those other epic films.Secondly, the depiction here is wildly inaccurate. Lawrence's own brother said he couldn't recognize the character that was supposed to be his kinsman, and he actually went 'on tour' appearing on talk shows to denounce the film! That's not good. No one is around to tell us who Spartacus really was, or William Wallace, but we do know about Lawrence. And what we get in this film is, simply put, a very loose interpretation of reality. I was surprised to learn that several other British officers were already embedded with Arab tribes and were already carrying out commando raids prior to Lawrence's arrival. Watching this film you get the idea this was his brainchild and it absolutely was not. Anthony Quinn's character (Auda abu Tayi) does not abandon the cause as is shown here. It goes on and on. You can read all of the many inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article of this film.Lastly, the film limps to a conclusion. The 2nd half, or specifically the last hour, is not very captivating. It portrays the political differences and difficulties between the various Arab tribes and the British Army as they all vie for control of Damascus. It's actually kind of tedious. And then....it just ends. Lawrence decides to go home. Credits roll. That's uh....interesting. But one thing it's not is perfect. Anyone watching knows this.""Lawrence of Arabia"" was a highly influential film (for George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and others), and it certainly deserves a place in cinematic history, but beware of those stating that this film is 'unmatched' or that it's 'the greatest film ever.' That's extremely high praise and difficult to prove. In my book, having just watched it, it's neither.8/10. Very good but has some baggage. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Because of its length and less-than-satisfying ending, not for a long time.",Lawrence of Arabia
239,jonathandoe_se7en,"Classic about a man, consumed by the desert...",8,8 September 2001,"It's funny how the production of some films actually goes onto mirror the subject matter. Fitzcarraldo was the story of one man's attempt to bring something beautiful to the masses, at whatever count. The adventures of Baron Munchausen was the story of an aging dreamer, trying to ignore defeat and go on one last escapade before he was crushed by the higher powers, and then we come to Lawrence of Arabia. David Lean's look at a man consumed and fascinated by the desert.In his story of the life of British lieutenant T.E. Lawrence and his quest across the Saudi Arabian desert, David Lean realised his true cinematic power for the first time. Painting his epic on the biggest 70mm canvas, filling it with hundreds of extras, every performance on the mark, this wasn't just a film to Lean, it represented himself, the single minded vision of Lawrence struck a cord with Lean.And despite the fact that this is undeniably Lean's film, the cast should not be ignored. This was back when an epic meant, EPIC, in every sense of the word, and Lawrence has an epic cast to die for. Peter O' Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins and the mighty Alec Guinness, there's also Freddy Young and Nicholas Roeg's stunning cinematography, making the vast and empty desert seem almost claustrophobic.This is full of memorable moments and images, the huge black locomotive moving through the desert, Sharif's first entrance as a shimmering mirage, Lawrence's questioning... And even if it does slump a little in the middle, and it's length will mean this isn't a film you will want to watch every week becomes enough for it lose points, Lawrence of Arabia is still a true classic, too often ignored by today's' MTV standards.

Peter O Tool's frail and feeble physique does not hold true to the legend of Col. T.E. Lawrence. A warring protagonist should had been a physically strong actor. 2. The legend of T.E. LAWRENCE IS OVER BLOWN, because the Ottomon Empire was on its own decline, since the mid-19th century. The death blow to its bygone glory had already struck during the WW-I.

Eventually, he leads his army northward and helps a British General destroy the power of the Ottoman Empire David Lean's stunning film is often referred to as ""One of the greatest films ever made"" and one of the ""greatest British films to cross the pond ""and rightly so. So breathtakingly beautiful I even had the stunning colors in my dream last night and that score playing over and over again. As Spielberg said on the DVD"" A film which is an inspirational to all"" and I totally concur with that as I, like Spielberg won't to try direction in the future. This is the film that inspired Spielberg to make movies and the likes of Scorsese. So this is one film that no-one should miss. A film of epic proportion and stunning visuals is overwhelming when you watch it. In modern film making it's unlikely that you will see a film so authentic as this. With the introduction of CGI, a film like this would not be made today! I doubt I'll give such a detailed review, as I am still spellbound by the film...still thinking about it's greatness. I will most likely repeat myself, so bear with me. It took 2 years to film this, but you can see the attention to detail in every frame. So well directed and so well put together with stunning visuals, which makes most films you've seen recently look average. If only films were like this now, I would be so much more happy! The screenplay has to be one of the greatest ever written. Every bit of dialogue, you want to hear and when there's no dialogue you are still engaged by the landscape and the spacial awareness of the characters-who so wonderful portray their characters, you can't help but feel part of the film. Each actor's dialogue so brilliantly play off one another...again it's so wonderful to watch. Some outstanding performances from Peter O'Toole, and Omar Schariff, who rightly gained an Academy Award nomination, and Alec Guiness and Anthony Quale. By the end of the film, I didn't realize it was almost 4 hours long, which again shows how much I enjoyed this film. Perhaps it shows the shot attention span of people today as to some negative reviews I've read on here. That annoys me a lot. All I can say to people is this, it shouldn't matter the length of a film! That score has to be one of the greatest I've seen on film. I am still running over in my mind now, so well orchestrated it's unbelievable. Arabia contains some of the most iconic scenes in cinema history from Omar Scharrif's entrance to Lawrence standing on top of the Turkish train with a background of sunlight....it leaves me Wowed. Again that scene with the entrance of Omar Schariff, wow! One of the greatest entrances I've seen. So well photographed and directed, you'll never see such a scene like that again. Superb! Overall, a masterpiece of a film, which every single person on this site such watch. Such an amazing film...outstanding!",Lawrence of Arabia

L of A show's T.E Lawrence, not purely in a heroic light, but the complex figure the man was.Lawrence was a confident leader of men, but also arrogant & naive, the last two qualities becoming more evident as the film wears on.The Acting in this film is brilliant, especially Peter O'Toole & Omar Sharif.

244,eklavya-cwk,arey bhiya lawrence ...... cut it out !,4,20 April 2014,"Lawrence of Arabia......an epic and a saga movie of a man in Arabia and those lot of things he does between Arabs and European powers. A huge cinema of a long duration as a memoir told in about 228 minutes (12 minutes less then 4 hours).Well well well, so far so good.....but let me 'inquire' whats all this fuss about. I mean why was this long and big movie created, won Oscar, and is rated very high? I found this film as a really monotonous, although not complete boring account, plain, colorless, eventfully eventless, dramatically hopeless, forlorn, woebegone, abject-ed journey, despairing account of events that were so so so artificial that such kind of artificiality may be considered as a new kind of film style by movie geeks (scholars).I will compare it with the title of the film I just found ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bridge of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2"".",Lawrence of Arabia

Because it's a wonderful movie with a great story, superb images of the desert and great acting. It's a movie that follows the fascinating story of an interesting character:T.E. Lawrence a.k.a Lawrence of Arabia. Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence a I don't think they could have chosen a better actor for this role. He is great. Alec Guiness is as good as ever and the overall distribution is impressive. You will also see the acting debut of Omar Sharif. You are not convinced yet!?

David Lean's portrayal of the British officer is magnificently done on 70mm film. One can imagine just how long it would have to take to get a proper shot while using such bulky equipment in the desert. Regardless, this is Lean's masterpiece and one of the greatest films of all time.Performances from Peter O'Toole, Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif and especially Anthony Quinn are flawless and do a great deal in making this four hour film not seem like a four hour film.I would recommend this film to all, because seeing a film of this magnitude makes one appreciate what good films are all about.9/10 stars.",Lawrence of Arabia
247,shhimundercoverdamnit,"""I pray that I will never see the desert again!""",8,11 February 2008,"This sweeping, highly literate historical epic covers the Allies' Mideastern campaign during World War I as seen through the eyes of the enigmatic T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole, in the role that made him a star).The film follows the eccentric British officer as he tries to united such desert leaders of Arabia such as Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif), Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) and Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn against the Turks during World War I.Director David Lean orchestrates sweeping battle sequences and breathtaking action, but the film is really about the adventures and trials that transform Lawrence into the so-called legendary man of the desert. The film is packed full of just fantastic image after another. For instance, the transition, of the match being blown out into the desert.... the mirage sequence. The film simply stands alone as one of the best films ever. My favorite scene is probably the one where Lawrence rides along the sea, after just having captured Aqaba.Equally important to the film is the psychology of Lawrence, who remains an enigma not only to the Arabs, but also his fellow British officers. There was a quote at the end of the film given by Prince Feisal (Guinness) that really summed this up. It had to do with the both of them being glad to be rid of him.One half of Lawrence was a scholar, a thinker, and gentle. But the other half was of that of a man of action, harsh, and decisive, and must of all flamboyant. No one is ever able to discern what Lawrence's motives really are in this matter: Sheriff dismisses him as yet another ""desert-loving Englishman,"" and his British superiors assume that he's either arrogant or mad. In fact, some could even wager that the man was insane & that he carried around with him a sadistic god complex. In fact, in several scenes he claims that he will personally "" give it to them"" referring to the Arabs freedom. Yet, what happens at the end of the film? With the common enemy now gone, old tribal hatreds simply spring back into action. They may have been able to conquer Damascus, but they couldn't run it or conquer centuries of hatred. As noted from the film. "" The Arabs? Who or what are they? I only know of tribes!"" In fact, one may just see the real Lawrence's whole ' labor of love' as hopeless.",Lawrence of Arabia
248,gerry-russell-139,The GONE WITH THE WIND of the 60s,10,8 February 2002,"The incredible vistas... the intricate costumes... the star-making performances... and the great Peter O'Toole at the start of his career... LAWRENCE OF ARABIA offers up a rare type of motion picture that only the prolific Sir David Lean could fashion. This was O'Toole's first lead role and only a small percentage of his later work (BECKET and THE LION IN WINTER) would equal this part. As Lawrence, O'Toole puts himself right at the center of danger, risk and compromise but he stands his ground through one conflict after another and still remains mysterious and elusive to all around him as well as the audience. Its a story that you want to understand only after one viewing but its the kind of movie that you have watch at least three or four times more before everything falls into place and the story makes sense.Lean's vision is second to none when it comes to making an epic. There have been very few filmmakers like him... Spielberg and Scorsese don't come close to his type of stature. You can almost feel the sands blowing across your face during the windstorm sequences and taste the blood and sweat during the battles. The one drawback of the film was the endless, grueling shooting schedule, it took nearly two years due to the heat and the unforgiving sun beating down on the exteriors. But they managed to pull it all off and turn in a brilliant work of art that holds up extremely well 40 years later.",Lawrence of Arabia
249,Magenta_Bob,Lawrence of Arabia,8,17 December 2013,"I decided to revisit this in light of O'Toole's passing, something I've been meaning to do anyway since I thought it was one of those pending 10s. Sadly, I wasn't feeling it as much this time and moved it slightly downwards instead of upwards, but it's still quite a remarkable film, and O'Toole is wonderful. For one thing I just didn't find the desert landscapes (which were the highlight last time) as jaw-dropping anymore, however vast and beautiful they still were. I can only hope I won't be desensitized to Barry Lyndon too when I revisit that. The plot as such also enthralled me less, I wouldn't say it's a chore to sit through but the three and a half hours did take their toll.However despite being less riveted this time around it probably resonated more with me thematically than before. It's a very fascinating character study; not entirely a linear rise and fall type of movie but somewhat of a wavelike pattern of mythologization and demythologization, with Lawrence bordering on a deity at times (e.g. ""You gave life and you took it. The writing is still yours.""), and at other times being a very small man, highlighting the frailty of idolatry. There are these lines by Arcade Fire that I keep returning to which I think go quite well with this film as well:""I'm standing on a stage/ Of fear and self-doubt/ It's a hollow play/ But they'll clap anyway""I think I may have read things into Lawrence that weren't necessarily there, or projected my own demons onto him, but it's such a rich and complex character that it sort of lends itself to that. This might sound super arrogant but I really latched onto the conflict between self-loathing and at the same time thinking very highly of oneself, of thinking that you're destined for great things and the burden that comes with it, as well as the thought of ""hey, maybe I could go far, but maybe I just want to settle for a common life with four walls and adobe slats"". Just in the passing there is this profound conversation where a general tells Lawrence that ""It's a terrible thing for a man to funk (his destiny) if he has (one),"", and Lawrence goes something like ""Are you speaking from experience? () You're guessing, then.""",Lawrence of Arabia
250,varundelpiero,An epic in every sense of the word...,8,8 December 2008,"LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is the kind of long and sprawling epic that needs to be seen on a large projection screen in order to fully take in the beauty of the cinematography. Unfortunately, where I come from, there is absolutely no chance of seeing it the way it was meant to be seen. Nevertheless, it was a spectacular and riveting visual feast, and one of the best character studies of all time, reminiscent of the remarkable PATTON, where the epic battles scenes serve primarily for character development, and secondarily for visceral appeal.Though a bit too long for my liking (I had to watch it in two sittings, although this was no fault of mine) it was an exceptional film, and were it seen projected, the length (over 3.5 hours, Director's Cut) may not have been an issue.Peter O'Toole is fantastic in the lead role, and this has to go down as his best ever performance in a stellar career. Omar Sharif and Alec Guinness are also impeccable.This film boasts, along with an intelligent screenplay, an engrossing story, marvelously breathtaking cinematography, and a remarkably epic score (though the score was somewhat under appreciated).This film is well worth the time, and well deserving of the Best Picture and Best Director (David Lean) Oscars for 1962. 8/10. 4 stars (out of 4).

251,mrspasm,"Lots Of Things To Look Out, But Nothing To See",5,30 July 2009,"Laurence Of Arabia is a film about an Englishman who decides to become a camel trader in Egypt. He gets involve in Wars, falls in love, and rides his camels. Camels are his one true love and they seem to understand him equally. Laurence is played by Robert Redford, and the best thing about the movie is how great Redford looks riding across the Mohave Desert dressed all in white. It was like watching a ghost movie set in the desert in daylight. Unfortunately although the film looks pretty it is far too long and nothing really happens. I like my films to be packed full of excitements, but in the 360 minutes of watching here there was only one fight scene, one camel chase, and the side of one boob. Very disappointing. Somehow this went on to become one of the most award winning films of all times, picking up 30 Oscars. If you want a better film about life in the desert watch Damnation Alley with Jan Michael Vincent. It has so much more excitement and has giant scorpions too! I won't be watching this again and I don't think you should too. Boring, long, and boring.Best Scene: When one man is looking off into the sunset and sees something approaching like a mirage. It takes 6 minutes (one continuous shot) for the thing to come into focus, and the director (who would go on to make The Shining) creates a palpable sense of tension. Is it going to be a monster? A Bad guy? Laurence? In the end it turns out to be the film's most startling scene- Ronnie Wood wearing the skin of Marianne Faithful which the costume department stole while she was sleeping and painted orange.",Lawrence of Arabia

253,Aditya_Gokhale,A saga of epic proportions..,8,12 October 2010,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" had been on my must-watch movies list for a long time. There was so much I had heard and read about it. A lot had been written about this epic saga of T.E. Lawrence as being one of the greatest and most influential films of all time, revered by many great directors including Martin Scorsese.I finally got a chance to see it recently, and considering all the good things I had heard about it, I must admit that my expectations were quite high.""Lawrence of Arabia"" tells the story of Lt. Colonel T.E. Lawrence, focussing on his war experiences in Arabia during World War I. A topic of such vast proportions needed an equally ambitious project to pull it off, and indeed, the filmmakers have put in a lot of efforts in painting this huge canvas and achieving what they'd set out to. Peter O'Toole plays the eponymous T.E. Lawrence. The film starts out with the accidental death of T.E. Lawrence in the present. The film then flashes back to narrate the story of how Lawrence was sent on a mission to evaluate the situation in Arabia, pertaining to Prince Faisal and his revolt against the Ottoman Turks.Rest of the film then shows Lawrence's own involvement in leading the Arabs in the battle against Turks. So needless to say, you are presented with extravagant battle scenes, and long, never-ending desert treks, Lawrence's new-found friendships, his emotional ups and downs and some difficult choices that he is presented with. The director heavily indulges in showing off the beautifully shot desert landscapes (with the excellent Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young).""Lawrence of Arabia"" lived up to my expectations during most of its long running time. In fact a lot more during the first two hours of the film. But something happened in the final act. Somehow the whole film seemed to go a bit awry and disoriented for some reasons which I am finding difficult to put in words. Suffice to say that it wasn't the overwhelming experience I thought it would be. For one, I think the film could have easily been cut short. A lot of time has been spent on desert treks and their long journeys through it. Yes, these scenes do require detail to show the hardships these men must've faced while crossing those perilous desert lands. But I somehow feel the director went too far in his attempt. So much so that the events taking place in the final 30-45 minutes seem too abrupt and disconnected.There have been films as long as this and longer, but they have enough substance to fill those long hours. There are sufficient examples ('The Godfather Part II', 'Schindler's List', 'Seven Samurai' to name a few). ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has enough substance, yes, but a running time of 216 minutes, was simply not necessary.That aside, the film, of course has plenty of plusses: As mentioned earlier, Freddie Young's cinematography is superb, so is Maurice Jarre's inspirational score. David Lean does a great job in directing this script by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, but falls a little short of expectations in terms of distribution of the content. Nonetheless, this was in itself a magnificent, ambitious project and a difficult one at that, so it is not fair to nitpick too much.The cast: Peter O'Toole's performance is widely talked about. For me, frankly it was somewhat inconsistent. Not to take away any merits from the Legendary actor's acting talent. He was, in fact, great in some scenes. But I was slightly put off by the sometimes nervous, sometimes excessively confident behaviour. Then there were some scenes in which he went way over the top in displaying his emotions. Maybe it was the director who wanted O'Toole to act like that and O'Toole gave the director what he wanted.The supporting cast is great, especially Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness. I had seen Anthony Quinn in Fellini's ""La Strada"" earlier and it was great to see him display such versatility.All said, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a great film, but falls a tad short of being a masterpiece in my book.However, it definitely deserves to be watched at least once by any serious lover of cinema.",Lawrence of Arabia
254,lawrence_elliott,Quite Simply the Greatest Cinematic Experience of All Time!,10,3 June 2006,"I saw the Restoration version of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in 1989 at a local big screen theatre in surround sound. It was a thrilling experience that I will always cherish. I made the 9 mile walk home that night, beginning after midnight, and I felt as though I had been to Arabia on some dream-like cloud. I walked on air all the way home.The greatest film of all time hardly needs more words from me, but this film should be owned and seen on a regular basis just to remind us what great cinematic movie-making is all about.Sir David Lean's effort was not wasted. This WWI history was told brilliantly and the equal of it will not likely ever be achieved. I believe this film was greater in scope and cinematography than Lean's ""Bridge on the River Kwai."" ""Lawrence of Arabia"" makes movie magic by creating an atmosphere that places the audience successfully into another world in another time.I wonder why filmmakers today do not set their standards a bit higher so they can produce decent works of art. Perhaps they know they cannot achieve such a high standard for themselves so they give up and produce nonsense that they think will sell to younger audiences.Maybe one day soon some miracle will happen to revive the mystique of the past in the movie making of today. But this could be too much to hope for in a high tech world that is only bent on making ""a fast buck.""""Lawrence of Arabia"" captures on screen for all time the beauty and mystique of the desert in a time of conflict and war in this 1989 restored version. I am glad I saw it.",Lawrence of Arabia
255,johnmschofield,This epic is one of those films which oozes quality,10,4 October 2009,This is another one of those films that I don't watch very often and one of the reasons is I know how great it is. The real T E Lawrence apparently looked unremarkable compared to Peter O'Toole and yet his presence at the places he visited during his life resulted in genuine life changing repercussions for a enormous number of people. This film is a journey as the director puts it and if Steven Spielberg regards this film as his all time favourite then it is a journey anybody should make. It is a long film between 3 and 4 hours depending on which version you see but it oozes quality and if you lose yourself in it from the start you will barely notice the time. I watched it for the first time when I was in my early twenties and I was blown away by everything about it. I am not that bothered which individual won this or that award for their part in it because it is a team effort and potentially there were hundreds of professionals involved and they should all be congratulated for producing this wonderful film. This film was made almost fifty years ago but quality is always enduring and fortunately for the viewing public this epic is sheer quality. This film is not artificially high in the IMDb listings and if anything deserves to be higher but more people need to see this classic and if after seeing it you agree with me then please register your approval.,Lawrence of Arabia
256,audrablum,Should be seen at least once,8,17 March 2019,"This week I watched the adventure-bio-drama Lawrence of Arabia (1962). The logline reads ""The story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks."" I would have to say that the part of this movie I find the most interesting is that it is based on a true story. I always find these kinds of movies to be the most intriguing. I think that this provides a very powerful takeaway regarding the power of will and belief. Most of the movie was very professionally made. It was shot in a Cinemascope aspect ratio and 4-track to 6-track sound mixing, there were also some surprisingly rudimentary facets of productions. For example, many of the night time scenes were pulled off in some manner of early day-for-night technique via film-processing-technique. The special effects, particularly, the blood didn't seem to be professionally colored. The blood was too bright red and in some scenes not very believable. Despite the oddities in production, the casting was brilliant. Comparing O'Toole to the original photo of T.E. Lawrence if brilliant. There is much to be said about good casting decisions here. Conversely, being a different era, the dialogue was a little hard to follow in some parts. So much so that I had to turn on closed captions to really understand what was being said. I do wish that both the plot and the character were a little clearer. To be honest, I had a hard time following the action of the story or why Lawrence would make the decisions that he did or behave in certain ways. Sometimes it got a little muddy. I think this film is also a good example of how there are examples of white supremacy within old Hollywood. In this film it is somewhat glaring, but this can be really eye-opening too. Also, as is the nature of old-time films, the scenes dragged on for excessive amounts of time. Due to the length of this film, I can't say that I'd watch it again, but I do recommend it for educational purposes.",Lawrence of Arabia
257,tsf-1962,slow but absorbing,10,12 December 2006,"It is difficult to watch this movie today without thinking about the current situation in Iraq. Europeans--and now Americans--have been intervening in the Middle East, with disastrous results, since the Trojan War; ""Lawrence of Arabia"" tells the story of a man who played a key role in a critical period that led to much of the current turmoil in the region. In order to defeat the Turks, who were allied to the Germans, Great Britain unleashed the genie of Arab nationalism, and no one has been able to bottle it since. By promising what was then Palestine to both Jews and Arabs Britain unwittingly planted the seeds of the interminable Arab-Israeli conflict--but that's outside the scope of this review. Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence as a bipolar, sexually ambiguous nerd with a messiah complex (interestingly there are no women in the movie). In leading the Arabs to victory over the Turks Lawrence sees himself as their liberator when in fact he's the tool of western imperialism. The latter part of the movie, which depicts Lawrence's bumbling attempts to introduce western-style democracy to the Arabs, bears striking resemblance to George W. Bush's equally naive meddling in Iraq. As spectacle, the movie has never been surpassed and scarcely equalled; among big-budget epics of similar scope only ""Ben Hur,"" ""The Ten Commandments,"" and possibly ""Apocalypse Now"" come close; the only movie with similar grandeur is ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and of course that's a different kind of epic. Sir David Lean won a well-deserved Best Director Oscar for this film. The movie made stars out of O'Toole and Omar Sharif, but there are Oscar-worthy performances from Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Arthur Kennedy and Claude Rains; Jose Ferrer is uncommonly creepy as a sadistic Turkish officer, in a scene with uncomfortable homoerotic overtones. Maurice Jarre's score is outstanding; this is the kind of film wide-screen was made for.",Lawrence of Arabia

First of all the film takes much too long. It is so boring, there are almost no interesting scenes in the whole movie. Even the action scenes are boring. Director David Lean could at least have made the fight scenes exciting. There's also not much dialog in this movie. More than half of the time we see nothing but desert. Actor Peter O'Toole is acting like he has a face of plastic, his face expression is always the same. I don't know if the film is completely historically correct, but I doubt it. The Arabs are very stereotyply portrayed. The only thing positive to say about this film, is that the cinematography is very well done, certainly for a film from 1962. The music is sometimes quite good, but the music doesn't always match with the scenes.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, except to people who have insomnia.

This time, i watched it carefully for more than 3 hours long! Then only i realized, this is the best epic movie ever! To me, everything in this movie perfect! Please do not consider about the history if u want to judge about this movie. I am a Muslim, and i know that this movie insults the Arabians for being a puppet to the American. It is true that the Arabs is a puppet to the American till now. But that's not the point! The point is how a good movie should be created. David Lean has proved that an epic movie should be like this one! It's just another masterpiece such as Gone With The Wind! To me, i really would like to vote this movie and ranked this movie as no 1 movie in the IMDb list! For sure no 2 should be given to GWTW..

263,edchin2006,A History lesson,4,30 July 2007,"A History lesson - no, not about the Arabs and WW I - about film history and the history of film criticism and possibly public taste in film.How could such a mind numbing film win so many awards and draw the crowds that it did? Possibly, the public is influenced by critics and award granters. I wager many came out thinking - such great reviews - I must have missed something; too bad I fell asleep. Others probably came out thinking - I'll never be hoodwinked by critics again! Some films can be thought of as acceptable/good or even excellent when view only once, but upon subsequent viewing loses much of its appeal. The fist time I saw the film, I was quite taken by it, and viewed the director's cut to enjoy the few minutes of deleted scenes. I couldn't identify the cut scenes and viewed it again with no success. Upon reflection I noted that those added minutes did not add to the enjoyment of the film and that the film might be even better with more scenes deleted. (Since then I have been unable to stay awake during an entire screening in about a half dozen attempts.) A quick perusal of IMDb rave reviews found that virtually all viewers had only seen the film once, and while very young. If seen again, most (I think all) would marvel at how different their memories are from reality. So, the recommendation is if you've not yet seen it, enjoy a peek into yesteryear and marvel at how tastes were so different and how lucky we are not to have such films anymore. If you saw it years ago, remember the old saying - You can never go home. Don't disappoint yourselves; it isn't as you remember.

265,j-penkair,Lean of Arabia,8,18 December 2015,"This film is so well-celebrated for such a long time. Much like ""The Godfather"" or ""The Exorcist"", I thought there was nothing more to add, until I got to watch it up close recently. This time, I found the character of Major T.E. Lawrence to be one of the oddest characters of the so-called ""heroes"" in the history of world cinema. He is indeed larger than life, as they say, but he is also a psychologically challenging person whose real intent is never clear. At the time of its 1962 original release, not many films dare to feature an ambiguous character as their heroes. As a rebel, Lawrence is never as conventional as Lenin, Mao, or Che Guevara. His plight is terrifyingly personal, leading us to believe that his suppressed homosexuality may have something to do with his motivation. The Sadism and Masochism of a gay or non-gay person is another addition to such a murky drive. This psychoanalysis can go on and on. My point, though, is David Lean's unconventional selection of such topic of his epic. This goes for Robert Bolt, its script writer, and Peter O'Toole, as a first timer, too. These men take a great risk of being shunned by the scared public of such a progressive idea. Having said so, I think we must credit the flamboyant producer of this film, Sam Spiegel, as well. He risks being branded as a dubious character just to push the story of crazy Lawrence to the world, despite being the film's money man. David Lean, as we look back, is great because he possesses the dual qualities of the true lover of film process, and an unconventional view of the world and its ingredients as a society. In a way, Lean tells Lawrence's story because Lawrence represents him in some strangely rebellious and alienated vision of the world. These two layers of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", a grossly fun epic ride and a hidden critique of the world's pretentiousness, are exactly why this film just won't die away. It is a cultural treasure of mankind to be dug and dug again. The learning curve goes on.",Lawrence of Arabia

267,thegodfathersaga,a great film that i respect more than i enjoy,8,5 October 2012,"Lawrence of Arabia follows the exploits of TE Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), a British army officer who served in the Middle East during the First World War. the film begins with a mystery, like Citizen Kane. after a prologue about Lawrence's motorcycle accident, we are transported to his funeral where he's discussed as ""a poet, a scholar, a mighty warrior but also an exhibitionist"". this hook works, and the film then takes us to Cairo years back where he's about to begin the greatest adventure of his life: to go to the desert and come into contact with with the local tribes concerning the fight against the Turks. as Lawrence becomes the centerpiece of the Arab revolt against the Turks, the rise and fall of his character becomes the film's main focus.Lawrence of Arabia is not simply a biopic or an adventure film, although it contains both elements, but above all, it is a marvel at the ability of David Lean to make the desert an effective character with equal or even greater importance than the major players. Lawrence is a unusual hero, David Lean portrays him as someone who combines charisma and madness, which was very different from conventional military heroes, as Lawrence is able to unite Arab tribes by earning their respect. Through the events that followed, we see Lawrence's character mold and evolve; at one point, he has believed himself to be some sort of a demigod, but after receiving brutal treatment, he becomes bitter, doubtful and seeking revenge, showing his darker side in exercising killing. Lean's film dazzles visually and raises interest around everything surrounding Lawrence; delving, although rather abruptly, more into his eccentricities, phobias and desires. but here's my major problem with the film: it doesn't explore nearly enough his motivation and drive. clearly there's something wrong with him psychologically, but the film never makes an effort to discover what that is. instead, it's content to present us with a Lawrence that is simply flawed for no discernible reason; is he a man with simple ideas who just loves the clean desert while disappointed at his surroundings? was it O'Toole's fault and his being unsure about his place in the film's timeline? or was it the uncomplicated script? i don't know, but the result is a character who the audience never sees as three-dimensional with motives and honest emotions.There are lots of reasons to love Lawrence of Arabia: the excellent cinematography, the direction, the score, the script, the performances, the symbolic imagery and the sheer boldness and vision of making a film that's nearly four hours long, with no stars, no women, no love story and not much action either, filmed in the desert. however, I can only speak from my experience when I watched it on DVD at home late at night, rather than a glorious 70mm print that, i imagine, would add a much greater effect to the vastness, harshness and majesty of the desert. at the end, i felt i respected the film more than i enjoyed it",Lawrence of Arabia

269,caseyt-48511,A True Must See,10,12 July 2018,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" is either the greatest movie ever made, or the second greatest. The true power and scope has only been matched by few other films. It is a film that really does stand the test of time. In an age where special effect driven films are king(as much as i like those), it is great to watch a film where you truly see thousands of people charging a fort on horse, and camel, back.
It's a long ride, but it is never boring. It is full of fantastic characters acted out by even better actors. Peter O'Toole should have won every acting award available to win. His performance is consistently ranked among the greatest in movie history.It's not only a wonderful film but a symbolic one. This could have easily fallen into typical tropes but it almost always manages to subvert epic conventions and challenge us. Lawrence clearly doesn't want the English to interfere with the new Arab state. He wants them to be independent after they were conquered for so long. He genuinely cares. But unfortunately, little to no promises were kept. The English and other countries cut up the Middle East and changed everything in the name of empire... No wonder Lawrence looks so sad at the end. He knows what's about to happen to his friends and allies that he fought so hard with. There would be no true freedom for them.Omar Sharif and Claude Rains are also deserving of much praise. The music is extraordinary and captures each scene very well. The personal journey of Lawrence is fascinating as well. He isn't your average epic hero. He's flawed, egotistical and by the end of the film he has lost his way. He started to see the revolt as being about him when it wasn't. He began to believe the legend that had evolved around him. He saw himself as a god but was brought down hard.David Lean's direction is practically flawless and proved that he is still one of the best directors ever.
All in all, David Lean's masterpiece is a timeless, must see movie that has not been diminished by time.",Lawrence of Arabia

The difference is not great, but it shows on the dark scenes, especially the nightly travel on the Nefud.Spielberg is quoted in the cover of my Region 2 version ""A Miracle of a Film"". It is a piece of advertising dung...Lawrence says to Feysal in the movie ""I am going to work your miracle"" and he does reach Akaba and demolished the Turks there.. It is an historical fact. Miracles do not happen, all is the work of Nature and Man. There is no GOD. Allah is an excuse to terrorism today as it was in 1917 when ""Lawrence"" took Akaba.This is a great movie because it depicts the works of human behavior in two levels, The Individual and the Collective. And where is ""Lawrence"" in this point of view?.Sometimes it seems he his on the Collective, but at the beginning and the ending he is above all ""an individual"".The collective will of a group of people is meaningless, except when the group is small, like an Arab tribe or a modern educated small nation like Denmark.Otherwise Democracy is a Fraud and the perfidious English politicians and their American emulators will lose in the End..

272,aciolino,Coming to terms with this film seems a problem for many...,10,23 August 2007,"Reading the comments posted here and the opinions in the forum it is plain to see that there are widely diverging opinions of this film which I find interesting considering the films reputation.Let me try to explain why I think this is so, and why so many find this film dull while others think it a masterpiece.First, like other Lean films, the drama is almost non-existent. The reason is that drama (the bedrock of all western art) depends on characterization and the playing out of these in various situations. But the lead character in this film, Lawrence, is an enigma, and remains so throughout the film. In a sense, he is very flat. However, in that he is an enigmatic figure we must change our view of him. That is, we must see him as being without definitive attributes one way or another. He twists in the wind, his true nature forever hidden. It is not good for dramatic purposes but for Lawrence it MUST be so, otherwise there would be no reason to make this film in the first place. We can never KNOW Lawrence -- we can only observe him from a distance, and stand, as apparently so many others have, in awe and wonder. Then we have the cast. My goodness. What an extraordinary collection of talent. The film is chock full of fabulous moments where the greatest actors speak wonderful lines. For example, some of my favorites: Guiness: ""And I...I long for the vanished gardens of Cordoba..."" The line was set up beautifully and filmed such as to make it climactic moment. Very beautiful. Similarly, ""You must be a general; I must be a King."" Consider, as well, the overall sterling performances of Shariff, Rains, and Hawkins, three enormous talents. If you are moved by these kinds of moments then the film becomes something very special. If not, then it's a bore.One more point: some may be bored by the visual. Not me. I think Lean's photography and choices are astounding, and they are essential in creating the flavor of the exotic, of distance and remoteness...mirroring the title character. Brilliant. Well, that's enough for now.PS - 5/10/09 - I neglected to mention Anthony Quinn, who has a difficult role as Auda, but whose masculine command and bravado, without cartoonishness is more than adequate. In fact, it's brilliant. JC",Lawrence of Arabia
273,johnmichael-2,Watch it for the last 89 minutes,9,27 January 2007,"The DVD I watched of this movie was divided into two parts: the first 132 minutes before the intermission and the last 89 minutes after the intermission. I watched the first part one night and the next part the following morning. My reaction? To tell the truth, I was sort of dreading those 89 minutes before I actually sat down to watch them. The first part of the movie had some good parts, but was so incredibly slow that I could hardly stand it. Take, for example, the scene where Lawrence meets Sheriff Ali. We see Ali as a dot in the distance--perhaps 1000 feet away. Guess what happens? The camera stays trained on Ali for all 1000 of those feet, not once cutting away. It takes 2 minutes for that man to ride up to Lawrence on his camel. Believe me, there are many other scenes like this in the first part. It is torture. The first part could have been shortened by at least 45 minutes, if not an hour.But, for some reason, the director decided to be more sensible with part two. The battle scenes became better, the pace a lot quicker, the characterization a lot more skillful, the emotional impact a lot stronger, etc. Those 89 minutes are what made the movie--all 221 minutes of it.If you want to watch this movie, I'm sorry that you're stuck with the first 132 minutes.

And ""Gone With the Wind"" should place.Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoy movies that take their time in developing a story, character, mood, etc. I admire intelligent subtlety in a film. But this was like watching paint dry. Or trying to detect the motion of the hour hand on a clock. Which you may find yourself doing several times during this film.I have watched this whole movie once, and tried re-watching it several times to see if I could ""get"" what all the accolades are about. I always end up discovering that my first impression was correct. This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. At least ""Gone With the Wind"" isn't that.The film begins with Peter O'Toole's character getting killed in a motorcycle accident. I think the film makers chose to begin the movie this way so that they get the only interesting thing that happens in the film out of the way and over with. Then David Lean and company could really settle into and sink their teeth into the tedum of the rest of the film.Anyway, all I can say is that this film deserves to be likened to the parade of the Emperor in the well known fable.

276,alexsnower,My favorite film,10,15 July 2021,"The greatest movie of all time...TE Lawrence was an archeologist who was called on by the British before the war as a spy against the Turks, specifically targeting railways. He learned the language and loved the culture. After returning home, the war started and he was called to Cairo. This is where our film begins. Lawrence is commanded by his general under the orders of a politician (Claude Rains) to help the Arab revolt. The revolt is under armed and was destroyed in Messina. Lawrence joins in Arabia and immediately plots to take Aqaba (A port in Jordan on the Red Sea). In order to do so, he must cross the Nefute Desert. This is to the dismay of Sharif Ali (Omar Sharif), the leader of Prince Faisal's (Alec Guinness) army. They successfully cross the desert and make it to Aqaba and with the help of a leader of a different tribe (Anthony Quinn), they take the city. Lawrence becomes war fatigued from his many battles and deaths he has witnessed plus multiple executions he has had to do. He also is having an identity crisis as a white man leading an Arab revolt. He doesn't feel he belongs with Arabs nor his own Brits. This comes to a head in Derra, where Lawrence is tortured. Lawrence nearly gives up, but upon hearing the Piko-Sykes agreement will strip the Arabs of the land they revolted for, he rejoins the fight. He takes the goal of the revolt (Damascus) before the Brits. This doesn't do much as the Brits and French take their slice anyway and Lawrence leaves Damascus for home upset and without an identity. This is such a great film and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves film!",Lawrence of Arabia
277,silva-w-pius,Game changing,9,6 February 2014,"In 1962, the British film landscape was barren as compared to its glamorous and fruitful cousin across the pond, but appearing from the distance, almost a mirage at first, David Lean and Lawrence Arabia came forth, allowing the world to once again fall in love with British cinema. Based on a true story, Lawrence of Arabia tells the tale of T.E Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) as he ventures into Arabia to unite the fractured Arab tribes, in the hope he can galvanise them forward to victory against the almighty Turkish Empire during World War 1.I love how the cinematographer paints a masterpiece that wouldn't look out place in a art museum; using almost exclusively wide shots and wide mid shots, to allow always for the enormity of the breath taking landscape to be kept consistently in shot, and Lawrence himself only acting as a small dot upon the horizon, to the extent that he appears as merely just another trivial grain of sand on the desert carpet, as they agonizingly trudge across, showing us how unimportant man really is compared to the beauty and power of mother nature. But what stands out to me, almost equally, is the contrasting of two scenes that best represent the futile nature of war, because in the end no one really wins. This is best illustrated in one scene where Lawrence turns back into the desert to save Gasim, who wanders aimlessly through the desert alone. Constant editing cuts to the sun, act like a numberless clock, counting the hours to his demise, only to be rescued from the jaws of certain death by Lawrence. But only for Lawrence in a later scene, having to execute Gasim for a crime he commits that threatens to disrupt harmony between the Arab tribes. Lawrence's silhouetted figure dressed entirely in white against the blazing sun, towards the later stages of the film almost in one image capturing his entire essence of meaning to the people Arabia, they see him as a divine creature sent from the heavens to bless them. Even the audience is sometimes fooled into believing this also. In all our eyes, this blonde hair, blue eye person, is truly a messier, but lurking behind those same blue eyes, is a blood thirsty savage and I felt that Peter O'Toole was not just able to do this role justice, in my eyes he exceeded all expectations, and took the character to whole new depths that I'm sure even writer Robert Bolt wasn't expecting. Lawrence of Arabia is also blessed with a beautiful soundtrack that perfectly wraps up the entire masterpiece into a neat little bow, going a long way to explain why the film was described by Steven Spielberg as a 'miracle of a film', and for me directed by a miracle of a director. 'Tributes for a prince, flowers for a man' David lean is a prince of cinema that deserves all the tributes he gets, a true inspiration to all that follow. Lawrence of Arabia is a film that should not be missed.",Lawrence of Arabia
278,druss44121-1,"Why this film is brilliant, and it's not because of 70mm",10,22 January 2008,"Note: I talk about scenes in the film so there are MILD spoilers.Yes, Lawrence of Arabia is remembered for desert vistas and sweeping battle scenes. The cinematography is unforgettable, the scale vast. In many ways, it defines ""epic,"" but at the center of Lawrence of Arabia there is a real historical person who was also a hero worthy of classical Greek tragedies: a man whose virtues are his downfall. A lot of people seem to miss this, and often I think fans of the movie even miss quite why there is nothing else out there like it. Every aspect of the film, from the narrative structure to the staging of shots, revolves around exploring not just what T.E. Lawrence did but why he did it, and what it cost him.The desert is a recurring image, but it's not simply a stunning landscape. Shots linger on vast emptiness, and suggest a blank canvas on which Lawrence can paint whatever he wishes. Profoundly alienated from his family and home culture, Lawrence pulls on the robes and persona of the man he might have been, if he'd been born an Arab. The deeper his insecurities reach, the farther his ambitions must go. He conquers the desert, and the desert conquers him, demanding payment for every personal triumph.The desert and the visuals of Lawrence of Arabia work in relation to the narrative, characters and themes in a way that would be impossible without 70mm film, without the long, lingering shots that make the desert itself a character. The desert shifts and changes, shimmers and conceals, as mysterious and indefinable as Lawrence himself. Peter O'Toole's performance is mirage-like, with emotions flickering and disappearing. Just as some shots linger on a vast and empty desert, others linger on his face, frozen in a moment of internal conflict.Director David Lean cuts together close-ups and wide-angle shots to reflect the dual nature of his film as vast epic and intimate portrait, as when Lawrence journeys through the furnace heat of the desert to rescue a lost man. Consider the sequence. A speck in the distance; Lawrence's eyes, lit up in relief and vindication; the man, who has expected to die, almost literally rising from the dead; they move toward each other, two specks becoming one; and finally: the impersonal specks become human beings again.Robert Bolt's screenplay is elegantly structured to show that the desert exacts a personal price for every public triumph, and that Lawrence's inner and outer identity are constantly in conflict. Lawrence captures a Turkish seaport by crossing the Nefud desert, but this success has required him to execute the very man whose life he just saved from the desert. Returning to Cairo to announce his military triumph, he helplessly watches a young friend drown in quicksand. Grieving and stunned, Lawrence approaches the Suez Canal and is seen by a British motorcyclist. To this man, Lawrence is a speck on the horizon, and when he calls, ""Who are you?"" we know this is the very question Lawrence is asking himself. The more Lawrence accomplishes, the more of a stranger he becomes to himself -- an unknown speck in the desert within.Eventually Lawrence must come in from the desert, and rejoin his own race-and-class divided culture. This time, Bolt hides the theme of identity in a way that can only be noticed when the film is seen more than once. At the end of the war, and the movie, a British officer shouts racist insults and slaps Lawrence down to the ground because he is dressed in Arab garb. A few days later, when Lawrence is wearing a British uniform, this same officer is proud to shake Lawrence's hand.Still later -- but seen at the opening of the film, at Lawrence's funeral -- this very British officer professes his great respect for Lawrence and berates a reporter, who really did spend time with Lawrence, for daring to be cynical about him. And the theme of identity comes full circle. Much as Lawrence fought for ideals his own people did not understand and against personal conflicts few would see, Lawrence of Arabia remains a film of many secrets, offering something new to discover on each viewing. It is the dual nature of Lawrence of Arabia, as an epic and as a personal exploration of the mind, that lifts it to a level of poetry made from images and dreams.Ironic that the film is like its hero: often celebrated but rarely understood.",Lawrence of Arabia
279,Hairy_Lime,"The trick, William Potter, is not MINDING that it hurts.",10,9 January 2012,"A British soldier – the titular Lawrence - and his Arab guide Tafas have stopped at a desert well to drink. Through a mirage and the shimmering heat, we see a black speck in the distance. ""Turks?"" Lawrence wonders. Slowly, with minimal cutting, the speck resolves itself into a man on a horse who rides up, lowers his weapon and shoots dead the Arab. It is a beautiful, shocking and violent entrance and given the time it takes, a surprisingly economical one. We meet the second main character and juxtapose his character with Lawrence's. We see the stupid and brutal nature of the inter-Arab feuds and squabbles – which sets up much of what happens later – and the stupid and brutal nature of life in the desert – a desert which might be as important a character as Lawrence.But as the movie plays out, it also plays off what that scene reveals. We already have some inkling that lurking under the civilized veneer Lawrence wears something darker is lurking. We know he is something of a professional risk taker – we've seen his demise, for instance, and the way his immediate reaction to learning how to drive a camel is to put spurs to it. But there is a masochistic streak running beneath it that may explain Lawrence's actions better: his trick with putting out a match with his fingers, despite the pain. It is significant that when he gets what he wants, an assignment in the desert that he thinks will be ""fun"" (""It is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun."") he blows out the match rather than snuff it with his fingers – the jump cut to the desert is not only beautiful and beautifully done, it indicates that the desert fulfills the need for pain that the lit match had poorly filled. After Lawrence leads a spectacular raid on Aqaba, he reports, ""We killed some, too many really. I'll manage it better next time."" But he also reports having to execute a man: ""There was something about it I didn't like. I enjoyed it."" In the end, Lawrence and Ali have changed places: it is Lawrence who leads and participates in the bloody massacre of Turkish troops at Tafas – now where in this review have we seen that name before? - and Ali who resists violence. But then, Prince Feisal had already previsioned what would happen with Lawrence. He tells the reporter Jackson Bentley, ""With Major Lawrence, mercy is a passion. With me, it is merely good manners. You may judge which motive is the more reliable."" And Lawrence learns that the internal squabbles of the Arabs are not the greatest problem he faces. Prince Feisal had already indicated this: ""The English have a great hunger for desolate places. I fear they hunger for Arabia."" Lawrence has been aware all along that his superiors have designs on Arabia (the historical Lawrence, by the way, had known of the agreement between England and France all along, but in the movie he learns of it only after Tafas, when the push for Damascus is planned.) and his work for the Arabs is designed to make them an English client state. Lawrence has been working all along for two goals, an independent Arabia and an Arabian client state.But then, this just scratches the surface of what is going on with Lawrence's character. We see so much more: the shameless exhibitionism, the intelligence, the possible sexual orientation – one wonders if his reaction to being raped in Deraa is similar to his explanation for the match trick – his belief in his own indestructibility, his conflicted loyalties and his love for Arabia, whatever the questionable source for that love might be. The movie needs a great performance in the central role, and boy do we get that. Peter O'Toole was a little-known Irish actor, primarily on stage, before this role. He is, if a strictly hetero man may say it, magnetically gorgeous and as perhaps our mostly naturally flamboyant actor he is a natural for the part of ""A poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior (and) also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey."" He gets the conflicts inside Lawrence and wisely never resolves them. O'Toole's performance here is perhaps the single most unfairly overlooked lead performance in AMPAS history. This man being competitive Oscarless is a crime.The movie also has perhaps the best color cinematography ever – Freddie Young gets the credit for that – and a magnificent score, from Maurice Jarre. Along side O'Toole's great performance are superb performances by Sheriff as Ali – smoldering sexuality in the love interest – the always welcome Jack Hawkins and Claude Raines as Lawrence's British handlers, Anthony Quinn as an Arab leader of questionable loyalties and clear motivation, and Jose Ferrer in a brilliant brief turn as a Turkish Bey. The only performance that too me seems off key is Alec Guinness as Feisal. Not that Guinness is not a great actor, but perhaps because for me Guinness is the most British of British actors, even when made up as an Arab or a Tantooean hermit he seems like, well, a Brit made up like an Arab or a Tantooean hermit.It is not a perfect movie. Lean's direction is overall fantastic – no one handled epics like Lean. The battle sequences are beautiful, there are images (O'Toole in flowing white robes atop a train, for instance) that are perfect and iconic. But like all epics, including Lean's, there are stretches where the pace seems to lag unnecessarily and the movie drags. The ride across the Nefud should not feel like it is in real time, no matter how gorgeously filmed. But that's a quibble. This is a great film.",Lawrence of Arabia

Several times you have to hear ""No, I didn't know him well, you know."" at his - T.E.Lawrence' - funeral and it will ring some more bells inside you, if you've read his biography. One might accuse the film here, that it missed the opportunity to show what his extraordinarity consisted of other than his control of pain and fear. But at the time, 1962, it wouldn't have made too much sense to include those things. Today though... the man is so severely against the modern grain that it would have been a delightful thing to have him privately portrayed. He is an anti-future, so to speak, a glimpse on a branch that history just didn't pursue any further.So much for Lawrence, now to the film itself. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" seems to be a monumental film, but all the wide shots do nothing to disturb its personal tone, probably because there is nothing that they capture, just the emptiness of space. Anyway, as such, as the exhibition of emptiness, they don't really work, that's better left to the imagination of the reader or the eyes of the tourist. The important thing though is that they do not disturb the personal tone, which is the quality of the whole film.That statement might surprise after my prelude, but personal isn't the same as private. In this film we see only ordinary stuff, people getting shot at, arguing, riding horses or camels and laying bombs. Yet artificial as it - as any film - is, it radiates warmth. The characters are convincing. Their dialogue is essential and sometimes, where you'd least expect it, namely in Auda, it is even philosophical, touching Lawrence' religious considerations ""It is my pleasure that you dine with me in Wadi Rum!"" This exposure of hedonistic thought illuminates a wider principle. What it means to be truly free. So free that you can even choose what you want to believe in, what you want to make the religion of your tribe. And what it means to be truly tolerant.Now, having stated all that, I still haven't even remotely begun to tell anything about the film's plot, about ""big things"" in Arabia. How ""big"" these things were in Lawrence' head, you won't be able to tell by watching the film, the term ""New Asia"" doesn't occur once, a shame, considering the influence of more recent ideas on the same subject. Still, a ""big thing"" remains essentially a ""big thing"", no matter how far you drive your fantasy. And standing against ""big things"" there'll always be the common things. Verily, both sides do their best to drive each other mad.And then, there's something more, something elusive that is never clearly mentioned in the film... o.k., enough of that parody. I missed the quote ""Preaching is victory. Fighting is illusionary."" I did miss that, because it captures the soul of this whole thing and gives the answer.",Lawrence of Arabia
285,chadlund,Not as good as everyone says,2,13 June 2016,"There are multiple historical, factual errors in this movie. I don't understand why it is so critically acclaimed. The movie rewrites history and in the end the movie Peter Otoole is the most overrated actor history. Omar is an excellent actor who deserved more recognition and praise than Otoole. But the story is too contrived and inaccurate to enjoy it, especially for a historical figure as celebrated than E.T. Lawrence. It just doesn't work. The fact that a movie so far fetched as this one is considered as one of the top #3 films ever mad leaves me very worried about the seriousness of many movie critics.",Lawrence of Arabia
286,eyecandyforu,Haunting,10,16 January 2007,"Hard to believe that after 45 years of loving movies, I finally got around to seeing Lawrence of Arabia. As with many films that make a huge impact on me, I dreamt about it that night. I dreamt of flowing white silk robes, decorated horses and sand. Lots of sand. Many have already given a synopsis and cast list, many have listed the films assets. For me, after the experience (and trust me, at 227 minutes, it's an experience) I was left feeling stunned and empty, stunned by the depiction of the desert, empty from the realization that nothing within the dark expanses of human experience really changes. Yes to one reviewer who was not sure Lawrence ever existed. He did. A very complicated man, shy yet full of an odd bravado, Lawrence reveled in the drama of a land he loved but could not be part of. He sought adventure and when it came, was overwhelmed and ultimately disappointed that his life was not like the childhood adventure tales he undoubtedly read. The film tells his story in broad strokes, very strong characters surround Lawrence, whose character is played brilliantly by O'Toole who stays quietly charismatic (as well as physically beautiful) creating an enigma that is never really understood. You're left wondering how the hell he got away with what he did, yet amazed that it happened. The futility of war is tempered with the romanticism it creates. People come together in common causes, strong relationships develop, heroes emerge. Wars are full of such scenarios and inspirational tales. But this is at heart the story of a film flam game, a bait and switch played on a grand scale with an Empirical Western giant manipulating desperate peoples using one of their flamboyant yet influential soldiers as a ploy. This con game was the undoing of T. E. Lawrence and he spent the rest of his life in guilt, trying to escape his fame, changing his name, reluctant to accept profits from his memoirs and wondering if the adventure had been worth it.",Lawrence of Arabia

288,YellowManReanimated,An Epic Journey to Nowhere,9,27 June 2021,"Whenever a filmmaker attempts to make a film in one of the most expensive, risky and yet, potentially, rewarding genres of cinema: the epic, the greatest accolade they can hope to achieve is to have their film compared with the generally accepted greatest epic of them all: Lawrence of Arabia. But what makes this film resonate so deeply? And what has allowed it to continue its relevance for so many decades?Well, the first point to mention is the film's sheer sense of scale and its visual prowess. Other classic Hollywood epics, such as Ben-Hur and Spartacus, had previously achieved a sense of the spectacular through their location shooting, mainly in Europe, but Lawrence of Arabia was the first film to actualise the full potential of the rugged and torturous conditions of the desert and to reveal its magnificent visual possibilities. There is an artistry to the film which has yet to be matched. From its magnificent widescreen desert vistas decorated with tiny human shadows, to its inspired transition shot of a lit match fading into the scorching Saudi Arabian sun, the film is a visual treat and its imagery has become part of cinematic folklore.Then there is the character of Lawrence himself. A bona-fide historical figure, the Lawrence of the film beguiles the audience; he forces us to ask ourselves: who exactly is this man and what motivates him? In the character of Lawrence, we have neither hero nor villain: what we do have is a complex, fascinating individual who appears uncomfortably flawed. And here is another way in which Lawrence of Arabia is distinct to its predecessors: up until this film, epics gave us a clear character to root for, usually it was an underdog who overcame the odds in order to achieve a moment of glory. Lawrence of Arabia seems to be following this trajectory but, ultimately, despite Lawrence's courageous, and outrageous, exploits, he is a man wracked with confusion, self-doubt, and dissatisfaction. His journey is not towards some greater good, he is inspired by no cause; he is motivated only by whim and a desire to rebel. He is a renegade, an outlier, an iconoclast. Through its protagonist, Lawrence of Arabia can be seen as a revisionist or even an existentialist epic: all of his effort, all of his military campaigning, all of his hardship, all of the slaughter and for what purpose? The fact Lawrence eventually leaves the desert and meets his end on a whimsical bike ride back in his hometown tells us something key: Lawrence's story happened, it was fascinating but, ultimately, it took him nowhere.",Lawrence of Arabia
289,Keyska2004,50 years of enjoyment and still thrilling audiences at any age!,10,24 January 2015,"How many movies in your lifetime can you really say left a mark on you? I was 9 years old when my father took me to the Michigan Theater downtown Lansing in January of 1963. I was amazed by the size of the theater let alone the opening scene of this movie with the desert sunrise. There were huge speakers in the back of the theater which enhanced the music perfectly. Peter O'Toole was the perfect choice to play the main character T.E. Lawrence. Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn and Jose Ferrer were perfectly cast for their parts throughout the movie as well as other movies that they would play in. World War I was a horrible war with so many new ways to kill each other readily available. The battle scene in the second half of the movie brings out some of those horrors. Lawrence was a visionary at the right place at the right time in history even though as time passed his vision was more skewed until he finally left Arabia. Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains played their parts perfectly as the General and diplomat who would use whomever they could to get what they wanted in the end. I have enjoyed watching this film for over 50 years and it still ranks a 10 out of 10 because of the depth of characters, scenery, script and music. I cannot say enough to advance this film as it does it on it's own.",Lawrence of Arabia
290,ruthgee,Wonderful,10,22 June 2001,"I saw this movie when it first came out and then again on our DVD, yesterday.  I think they have done a marvellous job with the reprint and thought it, so far, the best movie I have seen on our DVD. David Lean did a tremendous job telling the story of a very strange man, who was changed forever by his experience with the Turks.  This film is so beautiful and the script so literate, that I recommend it to all those who have never seen it. Lawrence came from a rather unusual family and was one of five illegitimate sons of Thomas Chapman.  The film was based on his books ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom A Triumph"" & ""Revolt in the Dessert"".  He never wanted to be a hero and remains an enigma. Make sure that you see the new and uncut print of this film. The cast did a wonderful job under very trying circumstances.  Just remember it is a long movie and be prepared.

291,ShannonAmidala,Hmm...not sure what to think about this movie,5,4 June 2001,"I saw this movie a few months ago. It wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be, and a tad confusing. Maybe I'm just not cut out for heroism, war movies. On the upside, Peter O'Toole was excellent. He showed the startling dramatic change of a man thrown into new surroundings, becoming accustomed to them, and caring for them and the people around him.I was very surprised to find Alec Guinness (who was wonderful as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars) in the credits. I really have come to respect him as an actor. Anyways, this movie wasn't anything greatly special for me. I felt it was way too long, too confusing, and at times, too boring. I didn't like the ending, either. I also felt that the concept of ""falling in love with the desert"" wasn't explored further. I give it a 5 out of 10.",Lawrence of Arabia
292,epsilon3,Magnificent,10,13 May 2002,"They don't make 'em like this anymore, that's for sure...Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies that defines the term 'epic.'Without going into the plot in too much detail, it's the story of a British army officer serving in Turkey in WWI. He's sent on a rather vague fact finding mission and ends up falling in love with the desert and it's constantly in-fighting tribal peoples. He attempts to unite them against the Turks and when doing so, embarks upon a journey of self discovery.Firstly, alongside 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the best looking film I've ever seen. The cinematography is nothing short of magnificent with some shots leaving one to ponder how they were achieved at all (the documentary on the DVD answers some of these questions.) The scene where Lawrence blows out a match and we cut to an image of the blazing sun is reminiscent of the famous scene in 2001 where the neanderthal throws the bone into the air and we cut to a similarly shaped spaceship. Yes folks - it's that good!! (The image of the sun is the only shot in the movie that's not real - they tried shooting it but it burnt holes in the film, so it's actually a painting.)The restored 220 minute version looks immaculate - it's as if it was filmed yesterday. Nick Roeg worked as second unit cameraman on this movie and it's clear where he got his inspiration from to make 'Walkabout' nine years later.The acting is superlative with Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and others putting in great performances. For me, Alec Guinness was a strange choice to play Prince Feisal and I was never fully convinced, but he still puts in a credible showing - just not his best. O'Toole does a good job of conveying Lawrence's confusion and inner turmoil - at times his eyes say far more than dialogue ever could.The scale of the film is amazing - thousands of extras, towns built from scratch and full on battle scenes. Despite what some philistines seem to think, there is no substitute for real people charging on real horses with real buildings. There's no trickery in this movie (apart from the aforementioned painting of the sun) and it shows - anyone who champions the use of CGI should watch this film and eat humble pie.As many others have said, you could easily write pages and pages about this movie. If I was a film student, It'd make a great essay. If you haven't seen it - do so. If you consider yourself to be a fan of intelligent cinema, rush out and buy the DVD as soon as possible, settle down with some munchies and watch the full 3 hours 40 mins. It never drags - It's quite simply one of the greatest movies of all time - period.",Lawrence of Arabia

Of course, Peter O'Toole was superb, but so was his supporting cast. Anthony Quinn looks more Arabic than Arabs. And Anthony Quayle always has been a favorite of mine and Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guiness, and Jose Ferrar were splendid. The latter was appropriately dissolute as the Turkish officer who captured LawrenceThe photography was spectacular, the skyline, deserts, and battle scenes. There were just enough of the fighting.

made film with an amazing story attached to it. The film
constantly hits you with exciting moments and
menacing shots of the desert, incredible music
included.The amount of extras used in this film is haunting,
some of the most spectacular scenes have hundreds of
people on camelback riding around through the
incredible landscapes of Jordan, although the last
desert bits of the movie were filmed in Spain. The
moments of suspense when you see a character
approach from afar, barely visible yet aching closer and
closer is just amazin9.Our main character is very interesting, conflicted about
his loyalty and traumatised by the violence, yet he
seems to be obsessed with the almost godlike status
he receives from the Arabs. I thought this film was
going to have this 'white saviour complex, something
you might expect when looking at the plot and the year
it was made. Luckily, this only becomes really apparent
near the end of the film, so good job on keeping it woke
for like three hours.It's only real issue here is its length. 220 minutes is just
too long. Yes, you will the story is very engaging, but I
still felt exhausted at the end. There are only so many

295,mr composer,A film well-deserving of its praise,10,18 October 2001,"This is a wonderful epic film about the account of T.E. Lawrence. I've always loved Lean's other epics: 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' and 'Doctor Zhivago.' However, this outshines them both. The grand trek across the desert is a masterpiece. For the most dramatic marriage of music and picture to ever come before 'Star Wars' pay attention to Maurice Jarre's best ever score, especially in these sequences.Maurice Jarre is an unusual example of a composing career. He composed highly original, and well orchestrated masterpieces in the 1960's. Besides 'Lawrence,' he also composed great scores for 'The Train,' 'Doctor Zhivago' among others. Yet, in the '80s he developed this fascination with cheap sounding synth scores. These scores showed only a tiny fraction of what he could do and, unfortunately, most of the time were too distracting for me in the films they are in. Now I realize I am harping on critically acclaimed scores such as 'Witness' and 'Ghost' but I'm sorry, they just don't work well. The suspense scenes work well, but then he does something that is meant to be orchestral, but it's a cheap synth version of it.Well, enough about that. The point is that there was NO better composer in 1962 than Maurice Jarre, and his own choice and opinion of the direction of music in general led to the biggest decline of quality over a 30-year period for a composer than I can ever remember.Back to the film: Whether or not you are for or against letterbox (which I am definitely for), you MUST see the widescreen version of this film. Otherwise, you miss the most fascinating desert visuals ever filmed. The cast and acting was superb once I accepted Alec Guinness as an Arabian Prince. The second half lets up quite a bit, but that's saying it goes from about a 12 (out of only 10) down to a 9. I still give it a 10!",Lawrence of Arabia
296,rtcnz,"Beautiful, brilliant, and long.",8,2 October 2012,"A few years ago, I tried to watch this on DVD on my laptop. I managed to get through about fifteen minutes before I couldn't endure it any further and gave up, but told everyone that I'd watched it but hadn't cared for it.I recently read Roger Ebert's review of the film and was struck by his insistence that this film can only be watched on the big screen, which I eventually did at the Astor Theatre in Melbourne.In the first half, I found my breath being taken away by the epic beauty of the film, and found myself delighted by the charismatic and unusual protagonist. I also laughed much more than I expected to. At the intermission, I realized how correct Ebert had been – the epic scale of this film can only be captured on a big screen. I was loving it.The film resumed for the second half. I was still held by the film but felt that there were a few false endings, when I was expecting it to (finally) wrap up – only to find it starting all over again. That is probably the only thing that detracted from me rating this film a 9 or 10. It's too long for me. I don't have anything against long films if I watch them without checking my watch – like Seven Samurai or Apocalypse Now Redux.But during this film, I did check my watch during the last forty-odd minutes – which were, I admit, every bit as stunning as the rest.",Lawrence of Arabia
297,zeedunn,As Close to Perfect as a Movie Can Get.,10,14 February 2009,"Last week, I received the awesome privilege of being able to watch Lawrence of Arabia on the big screen at a local theater. I have seen this film multiple times. In fact, I own a DVD copy, but I have never seen it magnified. And yes, it makes a difference. You can actually see the grains of sand blowing around the Nefud desert. You feel the sun burning down as Lawrence rides through the scorching Devil's Anvil. And more than once, you see those blue penetrating eyes staring straight into your heart and know how a skinny, white British soldier inspired the Arab people to almost free themselves once and for all from imperialism.This won't be so much of a review as a reflection. Truly reviewing this movie would be a daunting task which I won't attempt now.If you haven't seen Lawrence, it is an experience worth having. True, at 216 minutes, it is longer than your average film. But unlike some films of this length the viewer stays involved. In fact, at the end of this film, I am always wanting more. It seems impossible that a people group could get so close to their goal only to turn back. And I want to see Lawrence and Sheriff Ali continue their strange, endearing fellowship past what this film shows. And unlike some biopics, we don't see some long drawn out story about how painful Lawrence's childhood was or follow him past his prime to see him sighing over lost opportunities. The ending is abrupt with no sense of conclusion. The whole thing seems like a big buildup to failure, but no one ever said Lawrence of Arabia could be put into a nice, neat box.At the beginning, T.E. Lawrence is stationed in Cairo in the maps room. He is portrayed as messy, reckless, and somewhat masochistic. He enjoys letting a match burn down to his fingers and ""not minding that it hurts."" He is called to the general's quarters by Mr. Dryden, of the Arab Bureau, for his knowledge of the Bedouin people. They want to send him to look for the Bedouin people and Prince Feisal. His mission is to assess the situation. That's a somewhat nebulous task, but Lawrence is enthralled. He gets to come out of his hidey hole in the maps room, out into the desert, and away from those stodgy British military folks. Lawrence has an obvious obsession with the Arabian culture and the desert. As we watch him riding his camel, he looks around him like a kid with his first slingshot.Lawrence's initial encounters with the Arabs are mixed. He gets along well with his guide only to see the man get killed the next day by another Arab merely for drinking from a well. Lawrence sees this as somewhat barbaric, but we can see his eyes sparkle when it happens. This is a physical tell. He has been raised to be a civilized British conservative, but his heart longs for the feuding and bloodthirst of the eastern world.Lawrence finds Prince Feisal and his people in the midst of a Turkish air strike. He is invited into the tent and speak out of turn. Feisal wants to hear what he has to say. Lawrence seems to desperately want to please this man and to ""out-Arab"" the Arabs. What is his motivation? Does he truly love the Arab culture so much? Does he wish to glorify himself as the one who could make it work? Is he just suicidal? Is he out to prove an agenda? Director David Lean (genius) makes the wise choice to leave this open. He never attempts to ""explain Lawrence."" This is why people are still obsessed with this movie 40 years later. Lawrence is a mystery.Lawrence breaks with his orders by deciding to do more than assess. He decides to help the Arabs take Damascus and will stop at nothing to make this goal a reality. Not ridicule, not the impassable desert, and especially not ""what is written"" will keep this white boy from dreaming the impossible dream. He dares to hope, to dream and creates a believer out of Sharif Ali and the rest of the Bedouin peoples.The film contains moments of grandeur, such as the battle scenes and the train raids. It also includes quiet moments around the fire, like when Sheriff Ali tells Lawrence he can choose his own name. This movie is a symphony, which has dynamics of highs and lows. This is a lost art in the film world today. Above all, there is the desert, which is more than the setting of the movie, it is a living thing which invites Lawrence into its danger and secrets. The desert is the seductress which pulls Lawrence into his long arduous path from conquering hero to possible madman to a man resigned. The dessert brings out the very best in Lawrence, and the very worst.The dialogue is precise and memorable. The music is gorgeous. The acting is superb. The only problem with this film is that I will never be able to understand who Lawrence truly was. That is the maddening genius of this film. I am going to make a bold statement here. I believe this is as close to being a perfect movie as one can get.",Lawrence of Arabia

Over 200 minutes of movie but it was as if I never wanted it to get over.Based on the life of a Controversial British Officer T.E. Lawrence who helped Arabs fight Turks during World War I, this movie is a master piece in every aspect. No words can describe the brilliance of Peter O Toole, one great Shakespearean actor of our times, and his portrayal of Lawrence. His eyes said everything and the voice was just an asset which he used brilliantly as well. I can never forget the pained look in his eyes after he led the massacre of train full of turks.

301,vze3vhtf,"Visually Stunning, Yet Without Enough Structure",7,24 May 2014,"Some time back I read, ' The Uncrowned King of Arabia ', Michael Asher's BIO of T. E. Lawrence. In the book, Asher traces Lawrence's history, his sexual conflicts, his motives, as well as the geo-politics of the region, in great detail.So as visually breathtaking as Lean's film is, it is still nonetheless frustrating to watch, for me at least, because it makes little if any attempt to touch on any of the above topics.This frustration starts right at the beginning, when Lean devotes several minutes in the main title sequence, to a static shot of Lawrence's parked motorcycle (???). Then, after we are shown Lawrence crash, and his church memorial service, we are abruptly transported back in time.Now those of us with some familiarity with the story will of course know that this is WW1, in which Lawrence is serving as a young British Intelligence Officer, & where he started out as essentially a map clerk, somewhere in Arabia.Yet the uninitiated are basically just left to guess.And soon, and again abruptly, Lawrence is assigned to make contact with the nomadic Arab tribes, in order to facilitate revolt against the enemy German-allied Turks.Did Lean not believe that any back story was necessary to explain how Lawrence arrives at this point in his life? Such as:-How he came to serve in the Military? -How he came to speak Arabic? -How he came to be selected for such an esoteric assignment?Moreover, as I watched the film, it was striking to me that there was not a single subtitle or voice-over to provide the date/location/details of any of the events.Contrast this with other historical films such as, ' The Longest Day ', or, ' Raging Bull ', or even, ' Chaplin ', which provides such info, and also makes its significance clear.The absence of this info creates the effect of a circular panoramic mural: Beautiful to look at, but challenging to follow, without a clear beginning, or clear direction, or clear ending.So IF this, ' Panoramic ', effect was in fact Lean's intention, then he succeeded brilliantly, but I would have preferred more clarity.M",Lawrence of Arabia
302,b_havag,4 epic hours of being T. E. Lawrence,8,5 March 2009,"Almost 4 hours is a very long movie. Very long. So I sat down and watched with great expectations: To gain an 8.6 average from so many people, these four hours will have to seem like 2! And indeed it did. From start to intermission after 140 minutes I was very pleased. I had enjoyed Lawrences trip to and visit of the Prince, his journey through the Nefud desert, his meeting with tribe-leader Auda, his attack on Aqaba and his voyage to Sinai and back to the Brits. It was beautiful, exciting, entertaining and fascinating. I absolutely LOVED Peter O' Toole as Lawrence! Alec Guinness was excellent as Feisal and the acting was generally great. I REALLY cared for the characters. It was wonderful to really FEEL something strong for them, and it came from the marvelous acting. The scenery, the music and the storytelling was also flawless and breathtaking. The epics first 140 minutes had felt like 60.Lawrence continues his quest for the Arabs, he leads them into guerrilla war against the Turks, and everything still goes his way. But he starts losing men. The Arabs goes home to their respective tribes after having earned money and goods from robbing the Turks trains. With only twenty men left, he is caught while scouting the enemy-held city Daraa. He is severely beaten and thrown out in the street.Lawrence, now a traumatized man from this experience, just wants to be an ordinary British soldier again. And I really feel with him. It's like I just wanna go home to. Lawrence is then convinced by his superior general that he needs to go back to the Arabs to take Damascus for their cause. He succeeds in taking the city, but the Arabs are tribes, not a nation, and can't maintain administration over the city together. In the end the Arabs go back to their tribes while Lawrence goes home to Britain a defeated man.This movie's second part is harder than the first, and that can definitely be seen as negative. But in my point of view it actually SHOULD be like this. Why? Because Lawrence has it so much harder and tougher in the second part, and when it feels longer it's because we feel with him! Everything takes longer time when you're not enjoying it right? And besides the greatness I've mentioned about the first part, that is what makes this movie so great: It takes you so deeply into Lawrences situation that you feel EXACTLY as he does!

305,StoryCharts,Determination leads to the liberation of a nation,5,19 July 2013,"Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs.The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence.It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact.But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring.Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway?These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",Lawrence of Arabia
306,iam-1,See this on the big screen and you'll be left breathless and parched.,10,25 January 2000,"A wonderful evocative film, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA deserves to be see on the biggest screen you can find.  Beg, borrow, or steal a theatre, do the same with a copy of the movie, then plant yourself for 221 minutes of desert dryness (a big orange drink and a bucket of popcorn with not too much salt would be advisable).  There is an intermission; and that's good, because you may want to go and walk through some wet grass at this point just to remind yourself that there is more water in the world than sand. The story is basic - British Military Man aids Bedouin during WWI.  The rest is character development and scenery.  This may sound like belittlement, but its not. O'Toole's eyes bore through you like laser beams.  The scenery and camera work is amazing.  The action sequences are breathtaking.  The story is convoluted enough to keep you from being bored sitting in a theatre for this length of time.  Everything will simply leave you feeling exhausted from the sweeping quality of the work.",Lawrence of Arabia
307,pjpaix,A film that has always been gorgeous is now also prescient,10,20 October 2002,"Watching it for the third time (in its 2002 re-release) I experienced, along with the rest of the NY City audience, a chilling insight into the roots of our present-day wars with that part of the world. Even though Middle East history is just a background to this wonderful film, the audience was clearly moved when watching the sad irony and significance of a land being divided by the great powers of the early 20th century - the British and the French. We came to call this great stretch of desert Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon - and many other names. Yet the peoples in this story wanted nothing more than to be called by their tribal names, like ""Bedouin"".
The film, though, is really about T. E. Lawrence - and on this account alone it is a triumph. What a fascinating person - brought to life in a memorable performance by Peter O'Toole.Taken on another level, this is also cinemagraphic greatness. As you watch this film, it's such a pleasure not even thinking about how good the special effects are - because there are none. Somehow, our subconscious mind relaxes knowing that we're watching the real thing - the sun rising over the desert, a man on camel appearing like a ghost in the rippling heat of the sun, hundreds of warriors on horseback fleeing the attack of WWI-era biplanes, the relative cool of the officers' club in Cairo. And then on another level, the subtle poetry of Robert Bolt's screenplay is unsurpassed. Take, for example, the scene where Lawrence loses his compass in a sandstorm. When the weather clears and he notices that it's gone, he says, ""Well, no matter"", and pointing to the setting sun he says, ""West!"" In the context of his agony over his identity as either an Englishman or Arab, this is a beautiful way of showing his ultimate choice.If you haven't seen this film on the big screen I envy you: you're in for the most wonderful three and a half hours of your film-going life.",Lawrence of Arabia
308,JonB-2,How Can You Comment on Perfection?,9,13 February 1999,"I held out on actually seeing ""Lawrence"" until it was shown on a local big-big screen, and the wait was worth it.  This is a film that clicks on every level, and caught me from the first shot.  This is saying a lot, because I'm not normally into pseudo-war movies, and didn't know a lot about Arab history going in.  And yet, Lean and Bolt snagged me with the overture, and didn't let go...A lot of this is from Lean's amazing direction.  His prologue puts us right in Lawrence's shoes for a fatal last motorcycle ride, but his artistry is such that several characters whom we meet here but who don't show up again for another three hours are so memorable that we grok his ironies instantly.On top of that, Bolt's screenplay is a perfect example of economy; it's a good forty-five minutes into the film before we have a scene longer than two minutes; as well, we only get one expositional scene early on -- and yet, we're given character, situation, nuance... everything with very few words. The result was that, at the interval, I was blown away to find out I'd sat through two and a half hours of movie.  In objective time, it felt like about half of any typical Hollywood film.Nuance is probably the key word here.  Lean manages to educate his viewers in Arab culture, a key to the plot, without ever explaining anything.  We see it, and we understand.  In particular, I was struck by a caravan shot, in which a quartet of camels labor under strangely wobbling canopies. Nothing is  ever said about these constructs, but a mere shot of a hand and a wedding ring tells us everything -- the harem travels concealed; women are a secret here; and so Lean elucidates an entire culture in a way that's been forgotten.  Say it with me: ""cinematically...""Another lost art on display here: subtext, subtext, subtext.  The brilliance of the story is in what is not said, but is merely shown; Lean's trust in the audience is superb.  Consequently, all the minor characters come ravingly alive, and the differences between British and Arab stand out in hard relief without anyone ever making a speech about it.  (The mind boggles at how this story would have been hacked to bits by modern Hollywood thinking.  ""But, Mr. Lean -- you have to explain to the audience why they should think this way in this scene..."")  Lean never panders, and the film is all the greater for it.Add onto an excellent screenplay and amazing direction an epic story that's really rather personal, and performances from some of the greatest actors of our time -- Peter O'Toole, Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains -- and you can't go wrong.  But, my own personal caveat -- DO NOT SEE THIS FILM FOR THE FIRST TIME UNLESS YOU CAN SEE IT IN A BIG THEATRE.  Anything  less is a raving injustice to the creators.  If you get the chance, great; let your mind and heart and senses be absorbed.  Then you'll understand why this is one of the greatest movies ever made...",Lawrence of Arabia
309,xiomatic,One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made,10,14 November 2019,"Basically, this movie epitomises Hollywood at its greatest. If only Hollywood could make movies like this again. I could say today's Hollywood is so mired in self-absorption and catering to niche interests they won't make a movie like this again, but in my opinion they simply don't have the talent to do so.This movie is nearly four hours long and thankfully has a ten minute intermission just over halfway. In those days they actually thought about the audience don't you know. I actually watched the movie over two days as I do have things to do. It starts with a black screen, which is a bit disconcerting, and then some rousing band music starts up. It really sets the tone. All the actors are at their level best, Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif are standouts in a movie of standouts. Omar's entrance is iconic, one of the top three movie scenes ever made in my opinion.There's really not much more to add to what has been said over the years. If I was to use one word to describe it, it would be Magnificent.",Lawrence of Arabia

311,nixar55,One of the best films ever!,10,13 March 2004,"I was put off of watching this movie for a long time, due to its' length; but having seen all 3 Lord of the Rings movies back-to-back, well, 3 1/2 hours is a cakewalk. (And this movie even has an intermission!)This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The swelling score, the cinematography, the sound, the action sequences...everything was spot-on. The first half of the movie was most enjoyable to me. I felt like I was riding alongside Lawrence in the Nefud Desert, and I was absolutely afraid for his life (even though I knew he doesn't die in the desert). Peter O'Toole blew me away with his portrayal of a misfit who found a home in such a dangerous and beautiful place. His eyes were hypnotic, his body language was so bizarre, and spoke volumes. You could see why the sheiks and princes of Arabia liked him, and why Lawrence was so different from his English countrymen. All of the supporting actors were great, especially Alec Guiness and Omar Sharif.The scope of this movie is HUGE. When I think of how long ago this movie was made, I can only think that everything in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was REAL. All of the extras are real people, all of the animals are real, the trains were really blown up, etc. What a massive undertaking it must have been, and how sad movies nowadays will never be allowed to do that again. Why hire costly extras or destroy expensive sets when a computer can do it for much cheaper? (The only plus side of this being that real animals don't get hurt) Even in the ""Lord of the Rings"" epics, my favorite movies, there are times you can tell a blue screen is being used, and for a brief second I'm pulled out of the movie.Firstly let me say that everyone should see this movie. It was long, yes, but absolutely no scene felt unnecessary. None. Everything in this film was crucial to painting a portrait of T.E. Lawrence. Lastly, I was very thankful I have a widescreen high definition TV. I couldn't imagine watching this on a small screen. You would be missing so much. Even my set felt too small sometimes. I can only hope that this movie will be released in theaters again some day so I can see it in a format worthy of its beauty.",Lawrence of Arabia

I knew I had to buy it on Amazon prime in 4K. The desert scenes in 4K are amazing and jaw dropping; hands down, the most beautiful cinematography ever presented in cinema. The only thing I wish would be to see this on a big screen on Broadway. The Irishman from 2019 played on Broadway on the biggest screen I have ever seen - that is how Lawrence is meant to be seen. If you watch it, do it in 4K - it's worth it. A truly amazing and unique epic and one to cherish.",Lawrence of Arabia
314,kidboi,Epic.,9,6 April 2007,"Yesterday I finally saw this amazing film. Long before seeing it, I was told several times that I can gain the best experience out of this film, by viewing it with the biggest screen possible. I'm sure that's probably true, but sadly I did not have the chance to do so. Instead, I watched this film on my personal computer. I do however hope, that I will have a chance to see it again, only on a much bigger screen. But I'd like to think that I got what this film was trying to achieve(and frankly, it did). And that is to be the most epic film ever made. The cinematography, the battle scenes, the music, the mood that is created by the surroundings(particularly the desert) - it all helps to create a grand epic masterpiece.The acting is mind blowing, too. Peter O'Toole's performance is convincing and it's amazing to see how the character slowly develops and becomes obsessed with the desert and in the end becomes completely lost in it's embrace. Alec Guinness' performance was also quite amazing and he acts his character out smoothly. Omar Sharif does a great work at portraying a strong character who is forced to watch his friend slowly plunge into madness.Possibly the only problem this movie has, is the length. It comes close to four hours, if I am not mistaken. But in my opinion the length is necessary. It is slow paced, but it just couldn't be any other way. It helps the film slowly develop to a very melancholic and somewhat bittersweet ending.It's a shame I didn't have the chance to see this film in the theaters, when it was originally released. See this film. It's basically the definition of epic.",Lawrence of Arabia
315,erniemunger,Did Jesus overact?,9,4 January 2006,"Anyone foolish enough to think that this is not one of the best movies ever to have been made  embodying the very essence of what makes cinema stand out among all other cultural forms of expression  should stick to Matrix, Disneyland and Diet Coke. Pointing out its historic inaccuracy is simply redundant as it never claimed to be a documentary, and biopics generically put an emphasis on story development rather than truthfulness (cf. JFK, Patton, etc.). Lamenting the movie's pace is, at best, indicative of your dwindling attention span  you might as well ask yourself if the Bible's too long. Finally, bemoaning the over-the-top acting of the entire cast, but most notably O'Toole, is an anachronism as you're dealing with pre-method-acting Hollywood and there's no concern whatsoever with realism, let alone naturalism; besides, the film, more than anything else, is a psychological portrait meant to express (as in ""expression"") the inner turmoil of its main protagonist in the face of events bigger than life. Not to forget that O'Toole's character is ripe with homo-erotic innuendo, and subsequently his struggle against his inner demons must also be read as a self-denial of his sexuality, as is made obvious in the rape scene. Indeed, not least thanks to O'Toole's ethereal performance, T.E. Lawrence is portrayed as an outsider in every sense of the word, a pariah of both worlds whose acceptance he is desperately seeking. One of the countless merits of Lean's desert western is to make evident this struggle of the individual against society and conventions  but also its shortfalls , revealing itself in extreme situations that command extreme feelings. And rather than serving up an insipid happy end (as it would no doubt have to were it produced today), Lawrence of Arabia tells of the factual prevalence of pragmatism over ideals, of society over the individual, of tribalism over humanity, and not least, of war over peace  a gloomy message that couldn't possibly be more to the point, here served by a Homeric plot, a legendary score, sweeping photography, and immortal actors.",Lawrence of Arabia

But it's good in the way that ""Gone with the Wind"" is good--it's largely spectacle, only this movie was made for men. It makes sense that the two films sit at numbers four and five on the AFI top 100. They make a good pair. Neither quite stand the test of time. In Lawrence's case, Englishmen playing Arabs and Arabs whooping and hollering like ""Injuns"" in an old Hollywood Western seem, thankfully, to belong to a time of movie-making quite past. Another difficulty of the film is that it portrays quite a confusing character, as T.E. Lawrence the man is nearly beyond comprehension and largely an enigma. Peter O'Toole does an admirable job, but in the end, his character still has to remain an enigma--for an actor, that must be difficult. Omar Shariff, on the other hand (perhaps the only Middle Eastern actor to actually play such in the film) comes full circle, and is one of the more unforgettable characters, and performances, from the film.A good and admirable film in many respects, but it is good to see it for what it is: it's not the greatest movie ever, it's not flawless.

Lawrence' life.I have not read Lawrence' tale that sparked this film, and while I feel the film expertly told his life albeit from a skewed perspective, I don't think I need to read the book to understand the man.There is plot and there is narrative, and both are wonderfully told without any doubt to their purpose.

319,enddust,David Lean's best film,10,9 January 2003,"What more can you say about a nearly perfect movie? This is my favorite David Lean film, with Dr. Zhivago running a close second. Steven Spielberg has mentioned that this is one of the movies he watches again before he sets out to make a new movie. And one can see why. I think perhaps the test of a truly great movie is that it bears repeated viewings. The desert vistas are stunning and ""clean,"" the characters round and well-developed--even the minor ones, the soundtrack moving, the acting superlative, and the dialogue superb. While this movie may not be 100% accurate to how things really were (Lawrence was short and shy), who cares? It's not often that someone has a destiny to fulfill. This movie, better than almost any other I know, captures a man's destiny. And poor Peter O'Toole. When a film like this is your breakout role, how can you go anywhere else but down? Still, at least he had Becket and Lion in Winter as well as a part in Last Emperor.A note about the print. The special restored 2-DVD version is superb and accurate but as such it transmits some of the defects that have crept onto the print that could not be eliminated in the restoration. There are also portions of dialogue that had to be re-recorded, and it sometimes shows. We can at least be thankful that the restoration occurred when it did and not any later. Thanks God for digital.And finally, anyone who finds this movie too long or slow might want to limit their viewing to 1/2 hour sitcoms. If the shoe fits. ..Score: 10 out of 10",Lawrence of Arabia

Oh, the wave of Leftist angst that would ensue! Yet, in this film David Lean manages to weave an enchanting and historically accurate tale of adventure and struggle, of crisis and achievement, of triumph and tragedy that both informs and uplifts, without modern-day remorse over matters of race, creed or color.

""Lawrence Of Arabia"" was first shown in 1962 and after almost 40 years later, it is still beautiful.  The story of T. E. Lawrence is wonderfully brought to us by David Lean, director of another masterpiece called ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"".David Lean has shown us a man's long, yet never boring (at least for me) journey into the deserts of Arabia.  Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is an ordinary man that becomes a hero (at least in my eyes) during his extensive tenure in Arabia.  He becomes a traveler, a great man, and a leader to the people that he has associated with.  Only director David Lean could have given us a movie experience like this.An assortment of phenomenal actors are collected for this movie and what a cast!  Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guiness and so much more portray their characters with intensity and believability.  Never have I been so impressed. As Lawrence, Peter O'Toole plays the role of which his name is most associated with and is surprising for me that he made the role his own because before I got a chance to see this movie I imagined a man opposite from someone like Peter O'Toole.  Omar Sharif as Ali is one of the most charismatic characters in film history.  I will not say anymore about the cast because I'm allowed only 1,000 words to use in my comment.Will all do respect to classics such as ""Gone With The Wind"" and even ""Bridge on the River Kwai""this is without a doubt the most exciting epic of all time.

323,emeeme2003,"""Nothing is written.""",10,15 February 2021,"The Arabian desert; an absolutely brutal, pitiless, and unforgiving landscape, the ruthless, scorching daytime sun beats down on it relentlessly, as a veritable ocean's worth of sand stretches out to the horizon, seeming to go on for an eternity and beyond, creating one of the harshest, most inhospitable places on the planet. Even more endless than this desert, however, are the sheer complexities of the human soul, both in its capacity for good as well as evil, and in almost no other person were these inner depths and contradictions explored deeper and further than in Thomas Edward Lawrence, whose wartime exploits in Arabia were immortalized in David Lean's 1962 classic Lawrence Of Arabia, one of the last (and one of the best) ""hurrah!""s of the old-school Hollywood historical epic, and also just one of the best films of all time, period.The film tells the story of ""T.E. Lawrence"", a British military officer who, during World War I, was dispatched to Arabia to serve as liason between his government and the Arab rebels who, at the time, were not only struggling for their independence against the brutal dominion and oppression of the Ottoman Empire, but also against the ancient, bitter tribal divides that still threatened to tear them apart, even in the face of far greater, more urgent crises. And, if you're familiar with the history of the real ""Lawrence Of Arabia"", you already know that he was fairly successful in his quest to guide the Arab Revolt; he made alliances with various Arab tribes, leaders, and even royalty, helped lead them in numerous successful raids against the Turkish Army, and even oversaw the captures of the strategically vital outposts of Aqaba and Damascus, the capital of Syria. However, the main question that David Lean poses to us in Lawrence Of Arabia isn't whether or not Lawrence succeeded in his physical journey (although the overall fate of the Arab world post-war poses that question naturally), but rather, at what price did that success cost his soul?Over the course of Arabia's near 4-hour(!) running time, Lean compellingly tells the story of Lawrence's journey, both in a purely aural/visual sense, as well as in the inner, personal struggles of the man himself; Maurice Jarre's majestic, sweeping score still stirs the soul just as much even half a century later, while Frederick Young's breathtakingly epic cinematography fully captures the harsh, impossibly expansive beauty and majesty of Arabia, with its ugly, jagged rock formations, and disorientingly vast, incredibly parched stretches of sand that often threaten to swallow the characters whole, both visually and literally. As for Lawrence himself, Lean methodically captures every defining moment in his quest, painstakingly displaying the journey he takes from being a borderline insubordinate, restless intelligence officer stewing away in a ""nasty, dark little room"" and lusting to experience some sort of excitment in the desert, to a cynical, world-weary adventurer, disillusioned both by the bloody reality of front-lines warfare, and the self-serving, behind-the-scenes ambitions of the nations waging such wars.Peter O'Toole's star-making performance as Lawrence is still one of the all-time greats, perfectly capturing the man's initial, seemingly insatiable hunger for adventure, followed by his gradual but confident winning of the admiration of various, vitally important Arab tribesmen after they're initially suspicious of the foreign ""Englishman"", before his initial vision of an independent Arabia is dashed by the colonial ambitions of European powers, including those of his own country, and his extended exposure to the true, ugly horrors of tribalism, colonialism, and of course, war, transforms his innate self-masochism slowly but inevitably into a merciless outward bloodlust. O'Toole's portrayal here is as vivid as you could expect from any actor, past or present, with his piercing blue eyes and intensely emotional, quivering facial expressions combining to create one of the finest, most unforgettable embodiments of a historical figure on film, and one of the greatest tragic heroes in the history of cinema as well.And finally, despite having one of the longest runtimes in the history of non-experimental film, Lawrence Of Arabia still manages to feel its length in the good sense of the phrase, alternating between lengthy but (almost) never tedious physical travails across unforgiving, awe-inspiringly HUGE expanses of the Arabian desert, mixed in with scenes of strikingly personal, intimate character development and political maneuverings, not merely with Lawrence himself, but for just about every character around him as well, whether it Sherif Ali's tug-of-war between his hopes for Arab independence fighting against his innner xenophobia against Arabs of other tribes, the ""slim customer"" Mr. Dryden's naked, unashamed desire for future colonial exploitation of the Arabian peninsula, or Jackson Bentley's journalistic eagerness to find an idolistic figure to ""sell"" the war to his readers being dashed by his discovery of what kind of man Lawrence really is (or at least, the kind of man the war has turned him into), is a multitude of rich characterizations that just wouldn't be possible with a running time cut to be ""friendlier"" to general audiences. In all of this and more, Lawrence Of Arabia truly proves itself to be an epic to end all epics, and if it had to be one of the notes that the Hollywood of old was meant to go out on, what a magnificent note it was, indeed.",Lawrence of Arabia
324,Clockwork_Orange55,"""Every shot, every scene is so beautifully formulated.""",9,8 February 2016,"Once I read a book on cinema and it says that if late Peter O'Toole had been anymore charming in that dessert, then the movie would be worthy of ""Florence of Arabia"". It was his original striking blue eyes, predominant screen-charisma and surely, his knowledge and experience on acting, which made him a legendary artist of acting Hollywood. This is ""Lawrence of Arabia""; a 'totalitarian' cinema, where acting and assured filmmaking are absolute. The fact that modern filmmakers rely so much on CGI and such to produce kitschy films, cinema magic which enraptures audiences, is rarely being conjured up. Till today, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is highly regarded as one of Hollywood's greatest epics.This is a story of a young, educated British military officer named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole). Not vast to be a biographical motion picture, but greatly an account of Lawrence's exploits in the Arab Peninsula during World War One. At first he was being sent for duty to gather information of Prince Faisal's (Alec Guinness) activities on his revolt against the Turks. But not to the expectations of his superiors, he showed defiance and led the Arabs to fight their enemies. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a 'desert' film, with no major stars attached to it. If I were to live during that period of time, I would not expect success from it.Although the film is widely recognised as a Hollywood epic, it is rightfully also an excellent character-study. Lawrence, of the movie, is a multi-layered character. It is the coherent development of the mentioned character, that the film's writing actually plays a great role. Lawrence was a playful, carefree man at first. The man is slightly like a clown perhaps, but a very educated clown indeed. His personality preceding the invasion of Aqaba probably justified the idea that his fellow soldiers are actually stumped by his efforts in assisting the Arabs. The moment he was tasked to execute a man he once saved to avoid surge of conflicts between Arabian tribes, the old persona of his starts to fade away, and the new, darker one begins to evolve in him. His soul must be so well attached with love and mercy, that the abrupt killing of his friend affects him to the extent that it transforms him significantly, in spite of the action being utterly necessary. His troubled mind, and madness, are dragged till the end of his expeditions, only to develop leisurely, to its final form. But in the face of the character, his intelligence as a man of winner is not easily overlooked. Knowing that he needs more men to capture Aqaba, he successfully tricked Auda (Anthony Quinn), and his men, into joining his side. And also with regard to his other successful missions against the Turks, it clearly shows about his intellect as a military leader. Lawrence is a fearless and ambitious warrior, but it is his complex personality that intrigues me.The filmmaking of the picture is ingenious. Every shot, every scene is so beautifully formulated. Director David Lean and cinematographer Freddie Young had orchestrated cinematography to be the best out of it. The performances are superb, with Peter O'Toole leading the way, and was well supported by Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn. And yes, one shall not ignore the magical score by Maurice Jarre.It is of profound understanding that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" would melt cinema lovers with its awe-inspiring filmmaking, but again, I reiterate, the hero who is interconnected with enigmatic notions that mobilizes my love for it. The final scene of the show is interesting; Lawrence ignores the British soldiers in heavy military vehicle passing by, but shows attention when conservative Arabs catch the sight of him. This encapsulates the viewpoint that he favours the Arabs over his own people.""Lawrence of Arabia"" is David Lean's masterpiece, but shockingly it never turned out to be one of my personal favourites. But in the eyes of the world? It is one of the greatest absolutely. Released in the early 1960s, and deservedly became one of the most successful works of cinematic art of that era. The 'desert masterpiece' shines and bears upon light that coruscates from genuine movie enchantment towards audiences. I love to see the shot of a rising sun that comes in before Lawrence puts an end to fire of matchstick as the mention for that. The wonderment of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is rarely performed again, in my time.(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com) (http://letterboxd.com/Azid_AlexDeSmal/) (Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/alex.desmall) (Twitter: @Alex_DeSmall)",Lawrence of Arabia
325,thegreatshonen,Perfection,10,31 January 2013,"This is absolutely on of the best films I've watched and will probably see in my life time. This movie has the most majestic beauty I've seen on the screen and I'm so touched and in awe over watching this movie. David Lean created the greatest epic of all time by focusing on a character so complex and human, but magnificent. 1st off don't let the time put you off from watching. It's nearly 4 hours which even for me is quite frankly long. But the film flows by and you lose yourself in the world created for u. The cinematography is incredibly breathtaking. The landscapes and figures that inhabit this film hare beautifully shown with an almost halo to how good it looks. Seriously the most beautiful cinematography not by a guy named Terrence Malick. Peter O' Toole gives a commanding performance as TE Lawrence. Easily one of my favorite performances of all time, and maybe the most fleshed out pre-New Hollywood Era movie. The cast is also just as great too and highlight the movie. The soundtrack, which comes in the Delux 50th Aniversery set, is so enchanting I would be satisfied with it alone if I listened to it. (Great driving music btw) I really can't say anything bad about it. It's perfection on film. It's one of the most beautiful and inspiring movies I've seen, not from its message or ending but of what you can do on film. This is above all the best epic of all time, and possibly my favorite movie of all time (its a toss up between my top 5). Seriously something everyone that says the like movies needs to watch. And like its meta critic score its perfect. 10/10",Lawrence of Arabia
326,AHOLDER-1,He likes your lemonade.,9,28 February 2018,"Sound: Excellent orchestral score. 
100/100 Narrative: Circular narrative, with heavy fictionalization of Auda abu Tiye and some of the battles; especially the battle of Aqaba. The story is still told well though. 
80/100 Technical: Exquisitely shot, framed, and edited. Excellent use of montage and landscapes. 
100/100 Acting/Character: All parts well done. O'Toole brings out Lawrence's eccentric behavior well. Alec Guinness' King Faisal gives us a dyed in the wool politician playing against experienced Machiavelli's 
100/100 Did I like it: Yes, viewing this film on the big screen I felt like I could step out from my seat and into the scene.

327,the dude-3,Lawrence who?,10,23 June 2000,"After finishing this almost 4-hour epic, I wasn't quite sure what I thought of it.  The fact that the main character was never truly fleshed out to a distinct individual bothered me; that many of the things he did weren't really explained.  This faded quickly though as I realized he was more fleshed out than any other character I'd seen before.  He had self-doubts and flaws and was stoic at times and weak at others, hated and loved at times he couldn't explain, just like a normal human being.  My questions of why this is said to be one of the best movies of all time were soon extinguished.  T. E. Lawrence was one of the most defined characters ever brought to film simply because he was also one of the most undefined.",Lawrence of Arabia
328,Rocky-16,how can anyone call this movie over-rated!,10,25 February 1999,"Lawrence of Arabia is truly a great film. One of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest. It has everything one can ask for, terrific acting, great score and cinematography. The movie is as much an epic as a psychological profile. The main character in this film is larger than life but still normal and flawed just like all us and the mere fact that he became a hero just by chance and ended up a meglomaniac is strange. Some people say this movie is historically in- accurate which is true to a certain extent but it is really the most historically accurate movie ever made. Better than that stupid and shallow Mel Gibson film BRAVEHEART. I mean that was really a historically inaccurate film and Mel Gibson sort of re-wrote the history on Willam Wallace. Watch Lawrence of Arabia for the real experience because this truly a classic film worthy of being seen again and again. Anyone who calls this movie over-rated is missing something special.",Lawrence of Arabia
329,Rocky-16,A Film Masterpiece,10,22 December 1998,"One of the greatest films ever made with superb cinematography and a memorable score. I especially love this film because I used to live in the Middle East and know the history pretty well. I personally felt the heat,emptiness and vastness of the desert while living in the Middle East and I think this film captures that feeling perfectly. Lawrence of Arabia not only ranks right up there with great action epics such as GUNJA DIN, THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING but holds its own against such classic movies as CITIZEN KANE, THE GODFATHER AND SCHINDLER'S LIST. A terrific film and I give it an 11 out of 10",Lawrence of Arabia
330,sjmdd,An outstanding achievement - but not for modern viewers,8,26 May 2009,"I watched this movie for the first time about 2 days ago, and id like to share my thoughts on the film. first allow me to explain my summary comment. (I'm not giving away any spoilers because i don't think there are any to give away) L o A was made during a time when movies had the word 'epic' rubberstamped all over them, in 1962, only three years after ben hur, 2 years after spartacus, 6 or 7 years after bridge on the river kwai, you get my point, when movies were made not necessarily to satisfy audience cravings, when visionary directors like David lean wanted to tell a story and the studio gave them whatever they wanted in order to achieve this. the movie runs in at very nearly 4 hours long, and i wont lie here, sometimes it feels like it. the length of the movie is, however the only criticism i can find, as acting, script,and cinematography are quite frankly out of this world and the sweat will run off you as lawrence frazzles in the heat. my point is that a great deal of young people will be unaccustomed to such attention to detail in a movie, when the answers are not thrust down your throat and somebody is not slaughtered every 5 mins. i realise I'm been cynical but the days when you could whack out a four hour masterpiece and expect your audience to lap it up are long gone.. but that does explain the low ratings, obviously from youngsters who viewed (part of)the movie and were bored stiff. well what did you expect? independence day? if your over 65, this movie is probably one of your all time favourites, but if your under 25, well, just avoid.",Lawrence of Arabia
331,jacob-45,Flawless,10,1 June 2003,"Every time I watch this movie, I look for mistakes and cannot find them. It is simply along with The Seven Samurai my favourite movie. Peter O'Toole is brilliant, Omar Sharif excellent and the other player outstanding. Historically a bit wobbly, but Lawrence's essence is everywhere.",Lawrence of Arabia
332,DrunkenDeGroot,A mixed but pretty unique experience.,7,29 September 2019,"A perfect 100 on Metascore would indicate that this is indeed a perfect movie, and while I'd call a few aspects perfect, it has undeniable issues.The georgeous cinematography makes the 4 hour runtime much less unbearable, compared with the well used music compositions. All the performances are amazing, especially the main 4.All the action sequences are really well done along with the practical effects.The 4k remaster added a lot of depth.
The sunburn scene was really powerful with the image of the sun and that irritating music, and the dialogue generally was witty, and playful, and mostly cleverly written.The runtime itself is a choice that I feel like was really intentional and purposeful, this movie had to be big and monumental so that it could really make you understand the psychology of Lawrence, and I don't have a problem with that, but some scenes could've cut down. Some sequences are too long, while others are too short. And the intentions of the director aren't always clear, and sometimes it can feel like a mess. And while I think it's a completely unique, and masterful movie that I won't forget anytime soon, but the enormous runtime, sometimes unclear intentions, and cheap and really boringly done death scenes kind of bring it down for me. If you are going to do something that's 4 hours long, every single scene in it should be perfect, to keep me completely interested, but it's really not perfect.I'll watch it again 20 years from now.",Lawrence of Arabia

Epic of a movie.
Peter O'Toole dedicated acting, as protagonist was glues us to screen. Desert, more desert and man wrestling with himself and desert, unfamiliar surroundings and emerging from it. As a hero, for Arabs. Movie showcased Britishers as how they during war times, promising though with their own agendas. Made a look into how Arabs were, they were called Savages and ill disciplined by Britishers.

334,Dando83,Finally a classic worth watching,8,28 July 2005,"I should probably throw on a pair of asbestos overalls if I plan to insult the classics. It just needs to be said that the old movies are dull.I tried liking the Manchurian Candidate, but it didn't get my heart racing. Citizen Kane almost put me to sleep. Even some of the newer ""must-sees"" like Marathon Man were less than appealing.But finally, I can give an solid 8 out of 10 to a classic movie. While Lawrence's running time has put a dent in my free time, I can honestly say that the adventurous story was well worth watching. There were grand scenes and great fights. While melodramatic in some parts, most of the acting was good.Lawrence of Arabia is the best classic I've watched so far. I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the epic adventure movies.",Lawrence of Arabia
335,Lawrence-20,Best Film of all time,10,6 July 2001,"I can't say enough about this film. It's amazing. The director doesn't cop out by trying to sell the lead character as some infallible hero without flaws. Instead, he digs deep into the character, letting you see him slowly go mad. Very powerful stuff. They do not make them like this anymore. I think this is Lean's best work, better than A Bridge..  Although I usually refrain from giving this a 10 out of 10, since I'd like to think a 10 is unattainable, I gave this a 10 to get it back where it belongs in the list: in the top 3. This is as perfect a film as I can imagine.",Lawrence of Arabia
336,matthewpr06,The Best Film Ever Made,10,19 May 2008,"David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is about T.E Lawrence, an English Officer in the British Army who led the Arab Revolt against The Ottoman Turk Empire during The First World War.Lawrence of Arabia is an underrated film. Despite critical acclaim, box office success and seven Oscars, rarely does it receive the stature and acclaim that it deserves; quite simply Lawrence of Arabia is the greatest film ever made. There have been many attempts since the films release in 1962 to capture the epic scale of this production. Whether it's Ridley Scotts's ""Gladiator"" or Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy no movie or franchise has come close to achieving this goal.In modern epics (how hallow this word is in comparison) we are bombarded with images of armies and battles generated at the touch of a button by computers and the artists who operate them. Lawrence is different; indeed in the dark ages of 1962 it had to be so. Despite all the technological advancements in movie production why does Lawrence still stand head and shoulders above its peers? The answer is simple, because everything we see on the screen in Lawrence is real; watching two thousand men on horseback smash through the Turkish defences to take Aqaba is more powerful and awe inspiring than a bunch of pixels bouncing around a blue screen.The screenplay of Lawrence of Arabia is, for all intents and purposes, perfect. There is not an ounce of fat on it. Every word is measured, considered and delivered with passion and professionalism by a stellar cast of some of the generation's finest actors. Peter O'Toole as T.E Lawrence gives what is arguably the greatest central performance in a movie by any actor ever. It is a performance that, in my mind at least, surpasses that of Alec Guinness's in another David Lean classic ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". O'Toole is magical as the English soldier caught between two worlds. The depth of his performance is staggering; he presents us with a fascinating and unlikely anti-hero. O'Toole's Lawrence is a man who is tortured by the contradictions of warfare, the hypocrisy of the British perception of the Arabs at that time and a destiny that once achieved, becomes less desirable than an ordinary life. Omar Sharif as Ali also gives a truly excellent performance as does every one of the lengthy supporting cast.There are many films that blur the boundaries between art and cinema. Lawrence of Arabia transcends both. As a piece of entertainment it's engrossing, action packed and seamless. As a work of art it is a beautifully crafted and perfectly executed masterpiece. Savour every shot, love every minute, feel the excitement and enjoy the adventure of a lifetime.",Lawrence of Arabia
337,Movielistdotcom,Transforms you into a new world,10,15 June 2021,"I only had access to the directors cut so with all the unnecessary scenes and plot points I found it hard to appreciate the film until seeing many videos on the beauty of the film I remembered how utterly beautiful the cinematography (Possibly the best shot film I've seen). And while on my first viewing I did see the glory of the characters and the performance of Peter O. Toole (Who easily should've won best actor) I didn't see how well constructed the film was and how fitting and great the score was, I couldn't even think up a different score to fit the infinite dessert feel of the film. My compliant is only that the dialogue seemed somewhat simple and while it always serves a purpose it was dull and quick it was like an awkward conversion but maybes that's the point of it, it's quiet and they don't have much to say. It had a great bittersweet ending, he got what he wanted but not what he needed. The performance once again was great and I think the directing from David Lean captured the character and the film so well.

339,ethanj-41027,A Timeless Classic,10,3 April 2020,"Lawrence of Arabia (1962) - [10/10]Now this is an epic. An epic of epic proportions. To make a 3 hour and 48 minute film in the 60s, that didn't have many stars, no sort of love story, minimal action, a budget of 15 million dollars, and film it completely in the deserts of the Middle East is a feat in itself. It was shot in 285 days, won 7 Academy Awards, and has an actual intermission! Films simply aren't made like that anymore. Steven Spielberg once said that to film a similar film like this today would cost around 258 million dollars. It's extraordinary - just like T. E. Lawrence. I love this film, and so do many others, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, David Fincher, and Roger Ebert. There's a reason why we are infatuated with this film. It's timeless. This film holds up today, 58 years later, because it was filmed completely naturally. No sort of CGI backgrounds, remote location filming, or absurd action sequences; it was all real. They actually blew up trains in the desert, flew planes through rocky plateaus, and traveled across the desert on camelback. That's why it took 285 days to film! There are plenty of scenes where our characters travel across the scorching desert, and there isn't a human being in sight - let alone prior footprints (it's the small things that really tie this film together). It's spectacular.Let me begin with one of the many things this film is praised for, the cinematography. It is gorgeous. That is the reason I chose to use 17 pictures in this recommendation (and I wish I could've used more). Not a single shot isn't perfect. The cinematography, from F. A. Young, inserts us into this foreign world (and foreign story) of Arabia with the long, sweeping takes of the desert. Simply seeing the sun rise over the desert is an amazing experience. In (probably) the best shot of the film, we witness a mirage. Up to this point (I can't recall any other films with mirages), no film had ever captured this optical illusion. It's beautiful. A lot of the shots in Lawrence of Arabia (1962) are taken for granted. Just think about having to lug a Super Panavision-70 film camera (it's pretty big) out into the desert and film these complex crane shots, tracking shots, and extreme wide shots. Just the opening sequence is complex, they filmed a motorcycle POV scene. By today's standards that isn't complex at all, but can you imagine having to mount a gigantic camera on the front of a truck, operate it, and film the road in the 1960s?? Revolutionary. The average length of each shot in this film is also fairly long. That has a purpose; it cements us into the desert with our characters. Like I said, it's the small things that tie this film together. The things you may not think about. Those are the extraordinary things about Lawrence of Arabia (1962).David freaking Lean. What an amazing director. He had a vision, to tell a story that was lost in time, and to tell it with utmost respect for historical accuracies. He's the one that pushed everything to the next level. To film in the desert. To film everything real. He was able to manage all these moving parts, capture small amounts of emotion in large landscapes, and create a masterpiece of filmmaking. There are sequences (many actually) that I sat there and wondered, ""How on Earth are they doing this?"" There are countless amounts of extras, camels, horses, and sets in this film. I have never seen so many moving parts onscreen. He is a new inspiration for me as an aspiring director. He is the reason we have filmmakers like Spielberg, Scorsese, Cameron, and Fincher. And he is the reason we have this masterpiece that is Lawrence of Arabia (1962).I need to talk about the score. Maurice Jarre composed the titles that would be performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and it is beautiful. Never have I really been moved by a score like this one. The opening of the film is just a black screen for a period of about 5 minutes. In that five minutes, we hear the Overture of the film. Oh how it places you into this film. The black screen allows you just to imagine what you're going to see on screen and what you imagine is what this film ends up being. If there was ever a sound I would associate the desert with, it would be what we hear in the film. It is beyond iconic and one of the greatest scores in film history. It completely adds to the astonishment and experience that Lawrence of Arabia (1962) is. Listening to it again, I can feel the film playing in my soul. It's brilliant.The casting is beyond perfect. If you look at actual pictures of the real Lawrence of Arabia, T. E. Lawrence, and Peter O'Toole, it is uncanny. They are pretty much the same person. Alec Guinness actually plays an Arabian Prince in this film, and it is believable (times were different back then, as he was brown-faced). In fact when they were filming, some of the people that actually knew Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness' character) believed it was really him. I would say that is pretty great casting as well (regardless of whether or not it is culturally sensitive right at this time, Alec Guinness was really good in his role as Prince Faisal). Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi and Omar Sharif as Sherif Ali are spectacular. A lot of the performances are really above their time. This was Peter O'Toole's first mainstream role and he killed it. He carried the story extremely well, and was able to be the imperfect, larger-than-life, T. E. Lawrence. Whenever Alec Guinness was onscreen, you knew he was there. He had such authority in the film and really gave a great performance. The chemistry throughout the entire cast is golden. Especially O'Toole and Sharif. They work off of each other and you can't help but smile when you see them together. You can't help but smile throughout this entire film.The writing is above its time as well. Spielberg stated that this script is probably the best in film history, and I agree. It is really good. Story elements, important plot points, and key narrative ingredients are set into action within the first 30 minutes if the film. It's perfect. The dialogue is also extremely natural (probably because it was based off of T. E. Lawrence's own writings) but, at the same time expositional. You don't know you're getting these important details until they happen. At 268 pages of script, you would think the story would have moments where it slows down - you would think that. It doesn't. It just builds and builds and builds. I found that the runtime just flew by, and it wasn't a problem at all. I was so engrossed in this amazing narrative that it didn't matter. I guess time really does fly when you're having fun.The last thing I'll touch on is the editing - you do not notice it. According to Scorsese, the best editing isn't noticeable. I 1000% agree. The editing in this film isn't noticeable. It's timed perfectly. Great work by Anne V. Coates. I can't imagine having to look at all the footage that they filmed and trim it down. There are moments in this film that you can't even see the cuts. It's not noticeable, and that's how it should be.A lot is said in this film without the utterance of a single word. Be it a glance from Peter O'Toole or the heat seen radiating off of the desert floor, a lot is said. The soundtrack serves as the words to the audience's ears. The Arabian landscape serves as the structure of each soundless sentence. The actions and visuals of each character serve as the punctuation at the end of each of these sentences. All of these devices form the sentences that are spoken in Lawrence of Arabia (1962). This film is fantastic on so many levels. It is a great character study. It is a great war film. It is a once in a lifetime experience. I love this film, and I hope you will too. Lawrence of Arabia (1962) is a timeless classic that still holds up today, and in some ways is better than most films being made right now. I highly recommend - no. You need to see this film. This is a film that everyone should watch in their lifetime. This is Lawrence of Arabia (1962).",Lawrence of Arabia
340,leviot,A Masterpiece,10,25 May 2006,"This film is an absolute classic. It's an amazing story of one man's influence on an entire culture. A great cinematic portrayal of the Arabs' life in the vast expanse of the desert. It very deftly depicts the political waves of the time, how the colonizing nations of Europe tried to exploit the less civilized nations of Asia and the middle east.But the theme and crux of the film is about one man: Lawrence. A man with the guts and bravery to inspire Millions, yet a man who was psychologically tormented. Lawrence, essentially, seems to be a manic-depressive. Most of the time he has a courageous nothing-can-kill-me attitude, with unending hope and optimism. But then he falls into a pit of depression and loneliness, and even hopelessness.I found this apparent dichotomy in the man to be most fascinating, and it is portrayed very skillfully by the actor who plays Lawrence. The contrast in Lawrence is an interesting historical perspective on the man, and a great allegorical perspective on men in general.",Lawrence of Arabia

343,morgie55,"Great piece of filmmaking, but Lawrence's yo-yo behavior hard to imagine!",9,11 January 2016,"First Thoughts: Lawrence of Arabia is one of those classics I've never watched all the way through and so I picked up a 2DVD series for a song on Amazon.com. Though it's rated as one of the top films of the 20th century, I was not that impressed. Story & Plot: Love the cinematography of this film! The amazing desert sunrises, the mirages, the authentic costumes! The crazy Arab played well by Anthony Quinn! The sleek Prince played by Alec Guinness! (Yes, he did many films before Star Wars); Omar Sharif as Ali, the only character who, somewhat violent, had to keep running after Lawrence and guide him.Peter O'Toole's Lawrence is a bit crazy. I mean here you are as a British soldier who nearly ""goes native"", very independent, does his own thing, ignores warnings and crosses vast deserts and attempts the impossible.It's really sad, his character! Lawrence is one time a hero, fancies himself ready to walk on water, then next moment he wants to throw it all away, can't handle the responsibility of freeing Arabia and just go back to England to ""get a job"". I mean really now! He lets a mad lust for killing take over and mows down the Turks. Nowadays this film would push the PG rating since there's plenty of death for the even the most die-hard film fan.My DVD had a great interview with Steven Spielberg on how he was impressed by the film and how he met the director and picked his brains on the making of the film. Several documentaries and lots and lots of praise for the technical quality of the film.Final Thoughts: It's a hard film to watch, with an ending that is somewhat disappointing. How a man can rise so high and crash down so hard is tough to imagine. Excellent authentic desert scenes and a new look at Arabian culture; but the cons include Lawrence himself, a conflicted man who can't decide if he is just an ordinary guy or an extraordinary being.Worth the watch, won 7 Academy Awards, but I would not clamor for it!",Lawrence of Arabia
344,sweetlittlepie,A Masterpiece,10,26 April 2009,"This film could be considered David Lean's magnum opus, in other words his masterpiece. The late David Lean was a talented British director who made his name with films like Oliver Twist (1948) and The Bridge on the River Kwai. However in 1962 he released Lawrence of Arabia to the masses. This film was the one that won him the Oscar for best director.The film tells the story of real life British soldier, T.E. Lawrence. The movie is partially based on Lawrence's autobiographical account, Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Lawrence is sent to Arabia by his superiors to help the Arab revolt against the turks.The film has great cinematography by Freddie Young, and an epic music score by Maurice Jarre. This film swept the Oscars in 1962, and it deserved each and every one of them. This is one of the rare films that deserves the praise it gets. After you watch it you can see how it influenced other directors like Martin Scorsese, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.The film features a breakout performance by Omar Sharif. And it made Peter O'Toole a star. After this Omar went on to do the extremely successful Doctor Zhivago, also directed by David Lean, and Peter went on to do other critically acclaimed films like Becket, Lion in the Winter, and Man of La Mancha, among others.

345,maitreyee_mishra,ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE!,10,10 April 2004,"I have watched Lawrence of Arabia only twice (and I own a home video of it) and all I can say if it is one of the best movies you can ever hope to seen in your life. Perhaps this is one of those timeless, flawless movies that will have an enduring effect on you as a moviegoer. David Lean is one of my favourite directors...I have watched many of his movies and have loved them all. However, I think the two David Lean movies that have had the greatest effect on me are 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.
Based on the true story of T.E. Lawrence, the movie takes us to the depths in epic storytelling. From the beautiful Arabian deserts...and the horror of wars...to the trauma faced by the human heart and mind. The breathless cinematography is brilliant...it carries you away to Arabia with Lawrence. The story is so involving...the strategies needed to be devised, the problems needed to be faced, the fight to unite one race to battle against foreign invasion, and the greatness of a legendary man.
I think the beautiful scenic locations are not the only things that make this a great movie. What matters is the human struggle in this movie. T.E. Lawrence faces the most traumatic elements that he cannot forget; his torture in a Turkish prison, the deaths of the two young Arabian boys who admired him (and whom he had adored so much), the moment when Lawrence had to kill Gasim to keep others satisfied, and the ultimate war itself and the killings of so many people. This in now way had been easy for him and these brilliant expressions are brought to life by Peter O'Toole in a performance that deserved an Oscar but never got him one. The actors are all magnificent. O'Toole is brilliant and plays Lawrence to perfection, Sharif is so expressive and admirable as Sharif Ali and who could forget the wonderful Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal. I watched this the first time thinking that Guinness was a real Arabian! A wonderful ensemble of actors...out of whom I found none to be less deserving of praise. David Lean's talent unleashes in this grand epic tale which has all the beauty a film should have...ranging from brilliant locations to emotions and elements going far beyond that.

346,sangomiguel,"AN EXEMPLARY FILM, MODERN DIRECTORS SHOULD LEARN FROM.",10,7 April 2021,"David Lean's 65mm Lawrence of Arabia, is a fine example of cinematics, and it really shows how special effects are not the main component of a great movie.Not only did Lean opted for real cities, landscaspes and cloathings instead of scenography but also the devotion of every single actor perfectly reflects how it was, and probably is to be a man of the desert.One can see the development and evolution of the main characters and their relationship between one an other as no other movie does.The inevitabble method acting take transforms not only mentally but physically the actors and faithfully depitcs an English man defying the borders in Arabia,This film feels so large that even in 2020 one can not help but wonder, how did they do that?You've never seen anything like this and I mean it, there is no documentary out there, no recent movie, no set of pictures, that better shows the harshness, hotness, and majesty of the desert.If you don't plan on crossing 400 miles of arabian desert by foot any time soon, you won't have the chance to see what we have seen. If not from Lawrence of Arabia.I highly praise the whole cast, and appreciate them risking their lifes, going out there and showing us what no man but an arab tribe man has seen.From the very first opening scene Lawrence of Arabia demonstrates why cinema is the 7th art, every single frame of this movie deserves a spot in a museum.The Academy Award does not make enough justice to this jewell of a film.",Lawrence of Arabia

The movie show the real life story of a British military officer who rose the ranks due specially to his ambition in fighting for the cause of the Bedouin tribes against the Ottoman Empire.
The movie is filmed in separate locations, but brings the true character of the era together with great costume, and acting. The film is long at nearing 4 hours, with an intermission halfway in the style of the era the film is based on. Unfortunately the voices are a bit quiet at time during the film, but it doesn't back off the surreal story of the formation of the countries in the region specifically Jordan and Syria.",Lawrence of Arabia
348,eliasbelrhiti,A Masterpiece and still a masterpiece to this day,10,8 May 2020,"Lawrence of Arabia is a historical drama film documenting the adventures of T.E. Lawrence fighting the Turks in the Arab Revolt during the First World War during 1916-1918 directed by David Lean. The film was nominated for 10 Oscars and won 7 of them at the 35th Academy Awards in 1963, which were the Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Art Direction.The David Lean film is wonderfully and beautifully put together and edited with an outstanding image and picture (NOTE: the film was restored in 1988 and 2012), I was also stunned that the movie instead of having a typical 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio which is mostly seen these days, it had an aspect ratio of 2.20 : 1 as the film's format was originally 70mm, in addition it gave the film a more cinematic feel and made the image of the film a much more panoramic look which I loved. Not only in my opinion was the film fantastically edited and put together but the soundtrack and original score of the film was outstanding and completely matches with the film.T.E. Lawrence is played by Peter O'Toole who delivers an outstanding and seamless performance through the entire 3 hours and 45 minutes of the film, other characters of the film including Prince Faisal who was played by Alec Guinness who also delivers an outstanding performance throughout the film.Although the film included some fictional characters including the Turkish officers who T.E Lawrence, the movie wonderfully documented the adventures of T.E. Lawrence In Arabia and bringing the Arab Tribes together despite the current differences and conflicts they had against each other and then fighting together against the Turks to capture parts of Arabia including Aqaba and Damascus.Overall, even though this film is surprisingly and overwhelmingly long, this film is nonetheless a masterpiece and considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and in my opinion one of the best classic films ever made, and honestly whoever rates this film lower than 9/10 should go see a doctor as this film is nearly perfect in every single aspect from editing to the story. If you have not seen this movie yet, you must go watch it, it truly is one of the greatest films ever made.",Lawrence of Arabia

Larry of Arabia isn't about the Arab revolt or WWI as much as it's about one insignificant man who became great and then became twisted by his own glory. i am reading his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom now and this guy was amazing. i'm not done yet so i don't know how accurate the film is but who cares. this is above all a deeply pentrating and complicated character study. i really don't want to say much more than that because my meager words will cheapen a great movie.,Lawrence of Arabia
351,bsilvey,Majesty in the Desert,9,19 August 2003,"The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in ""Lawrence of Arabia.""  Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out.  Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon.  It's one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  And it's only the first of countless memorable moments in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them.  Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences.  ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has these elements too, but at heart it's a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.""Lawrence"" feels unlike other historical epics of its time.  In most ""big"" films--I'm thinking of movies like ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Cleopatra,"" all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as ""Lawrence""--one gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses.  One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot, and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction.  Everything feels static and wooden.  But in ""Lawrence,"" Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme close-ups of actor faces.  In one especially brutal scene, after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people, the action cuts to a close-up of O'Toole, looking panicked and crazed, gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he's reluctant to drop it, obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It's moments like that---not just an impressive battle scene but a character's reactions to the results of that scene---that set ""Lawrence"" apart from other standard epics.And of course, I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O'Toole.  He is perhaps my favorite actor, not one of the most prolific, but certainly one of the most unpredictable.  He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform.  He carries ""Lawrence of Arabia"" almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders.  That's not to say the supporting cast isn't great, but O'Toole towers above them all.  O'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be, and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization, leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshipped or feared, or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" again.  His later films are certainly more than watchable, and ""A Passage to India"" is even quite remarkable in its own way, but we would never get another ""Lawrence."" Even more reason to appreciate it now.My Grade: A+",Lawrence of Arabia
352,Rick_Bman,Amazing film to see on the theater screen.,10,11 September 2007,"I had been meaning to watch this film for quite sometime but the length kept me from moving it to the top of my Netflix queue. However, I kept hearing wonderful things about it so I really was looking forward to getting a chance to see it. When the AFI Silver Theatre near me decided to show a 70mm print of it, I decided I could not put it off anymore. From all the things I had heard about this film I knew I would regret it if I passed up the chance to see it in the theater. So, even though the only time they were showing it was 7pm on Sunday nights and the theater was over an hour away, I decided that I would see it. It was well worth the lack of sleep I got that Sunday night and the grogginess I was feeling all day at work Monday.Clocking in at just under 4 hours the movie is still paced extremely well and never seems to slow down or drag. The story is always intriguing and the characters always interesting. Peter O'Toole does a marvelous job as T.E. Lawrence, he makes this over-the-top character seems 100 percent real like few other actors could do. The supporting cast is just as wonderful; Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, and Anthony Quinn all do a wonderful job portraying their characters. And even though this movie is about T.E. Lawrence, the supporting characters are just as important to the story and had the supporting cast not been just as wonderful as Peter O'Toole the movie would not have held me for 4 hours. However with wonderful acting all around the movie is a pleasure to watch, even once your backside starts to go numb.The direction and cinematography of the film are some of the best I have ever seen. The desert landscapes look amazing. The battles scenes are brilliantly shot and editing together. However, the smaller, more intimate scenes are just as memorable as the larger than life battle scenes. Perhaps that is due in part to the larger than life character of T.E. Lawrence though. In fact the most memorable scene for me was the scene where Lawrence admits that what most disturbed him about killing wasn't the act itself but that he enjoyed it. Intimate scenes like this along with the huge battles scenes such as when the Arabs take Aqaba give the film its wonderful pacing that keeps the moving going.Probably one of the most memorable shots in the film is when the character of Sheriff Ali is introduce, riding his horse through a mirage in the desert. Capturing this mirage on film could not have been an easy task and it makes for such a wonderful and beautiful effect that would probably be achieved digitally these days. This one scene those is just an example of how wonderful this film looks from beginning to end. This is one of those movies that you could take almost any frame and it would be a wonderful photograph that you could hang on your wall.The musical score of this film is also simply amazing. Now, I don't really know a lot about music and I don't always take notice of the musical score for a film but you can't help but take notice of the score for this film. It always fits perfectly with the film and the overture at the beginning really puts you in the perfect frame of mind for the film.Overall this is just a very enjoyable film and definitely was a pleasure to see at a movie theater as it was meant to be seen. This movie also, most definitely gets my ""Seven Samurai Award for Excellence in Pacing in a Film Exceeding Two and a Half Hours."" Usually I am of the belief that if a film clocks in at over two and a half hours it probably could have benefited from a better editor. This is one of the few films I have seen that breaks that rule, and it is always a joy when a film is able to do that.",Lawrence of Arabia
353,wmdude1255,One of the most well known and yet historically Inaccurate film biographies of all time,9,28 April 2010,"I liked this film. Peter O'Toole did an excellent Job playing Lawrence. I did not like however all the historical inaccuracies as well as the mischaracterisations of Lawrence, Allenby, and Auda Abu Tayi. Lawrence in real life was the opposite of the way he is shown here. Also, in real life Allenby considered Lawrence ""one of his dearest friends"". What I said about Lawrence is the same for Tayi. When this movie was released, his descendants filed a lawsuit against Columbia pictures saying their father had been misrepresented. It went on for about 10 years before the lawsuit was dropped. Also, Gasim was one of four characters created for the picture. The scene where Lawrence shots him after he confesses to killing someone was put in to stir Anti-War Sentiments at the time. David Mclean was very Anti-War. It's not that I didn't like the movie. It's when characters are created, stuff added that never happened and events not included. All I'm saying is that if I watch a film biography, I want the truth and nothing but the truth! No invented characters, no misrepresentations of anybody or any of that other crap. I want to be able to look online and see that everything that was in the movie actually happened. Also, Lawrence in the movie says he doesn't know about the Sykes-Pinchot Treaty. Wrong!

Lawrence I could watch campaign across the desert for a couple hours more, at least. This is also one of those movies that seems to have gained more meaning as it ages. Take, for example, the scenes of Lawrence teaching young Arabs how to make bombs. A little more unsettling than it was originally intended to be, perhaps. But the real story of course is not one of nations and wars, but of Lawrence's struggle with his identity in the face of the horrors he witnessed, and indeed, committed. How strange that after all of the killing and plundering he experienced, he was most horrified by the lies he half-knowingly told his Arab allies. Perhaps less strange that none of those gentlemen sitting around the conference table seemed to mind.",Lawrence of Arabia

On a scale of 1 to 10,this movie is a 15.I saw a review that was critical of Peter O'Toole's acting ability,as the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket said,I don't believe you said that.I also watched this movie on the IMAX screen at Ontario Place in Toronto,if you ever want to find faults in a movie,watch it on this 5 storey screen,it shows no flaws.Today,the irony of this movie,is its historical perspective.Does everyone remember the scene after the takeover of Damascus where all the various factions of Arab Leaders were meeting to discuss the resolution of the aftermath.Does this not remind you of Iraq circa 2003? I find it chilling! Most notably was the political wrangling is only too glaringly familiar as we watch the same events unfold in the middle east Anybody who believes there is a solution for changing the mindset of that region is truly naive.Mr.Lean the world of cinema will miss your keen insight and talent.Politics of Hollywood and americana held this movie back in number of Oscars awarded.When you consider the awards given to Titanic,there is no justice.Peter O'Toole was robbed in spite of Gregory Peck's performance in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,but alas,Greg is an American.They need to create a new category for movies like Lawrence, because it is indeed,in a league by itself.

The acting was amazing though and I just don't feel like we get this same caliber in most films these days.There are some amazing visuals in the film made even more so by the fact that CGI was not a thing and all of it was done with practical effects.

365,elkabousmehdi,"""Nothing is Written...!!!''",8,7 February 2010,"I've always wanted to watch an old epic movie , because generally speaking epic movies are characterized by the enormous budget and materials rather than anything else, Well what I can really personally confirm is that LAWRENCE OF ARABIA went far beyond that.One of the main adventurous, mysterious and natural places is THE DESERT, in which most of the film is taking place occurred a story of a man named T.E Lawrence who was well educated, lofty to serve in the British army, try to convince the Arabs to become an allies in order to face the Turks and to win the war, he was excited to be chosen to achieve this mission, throughout his struggles to achieve it , it was clear that the movie was about him , a character study about someone who will find himself in a ambivalent situation where he will start to lose his head.David lean chose many good actors (Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, and Anthony Quinn) to come out with this successful movie, a movie of 4hours length which I personally think were all worth-watching. Peter O'Toole captivated our attention with his charismatic and crazy character at the same ,once in the Arabs troupes he was that leader who was going to guide them to ''FREEDOOM'' into the ''CLEAN DESERT'' ,once back in the British concentration he was back to that bewilderment feeling, incapable to settle his mind about what is happening.The desert harmony was perfectly used to support the quality of the image, David Lean PERFECTLY used the two cultural dimensions of the plot to make the film climate a mixture between Arabian with their camels, horses and their traditional outfits and also the Arabic spirit most importantly he depicted this resistance to authority that characterize the Arabs throughout the history, and the British one with the offices , politics ,modern army, buildings rather than anything else , (but certainly that was the case of most powerful countries at that time) amazed and hold our extreme attention while we are watching this master piece, even though the film was somehow short in soundtracks , I wasn't able to take my eyes off the screen.LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is one of the best epic films ever, and certainly will stand out as Peter O'Toole's best achievement.",Lawrence of Arabia

367,nferlisi,A Film of Epic Scale and Epic Proportion= One of the Greatest,8,30 June 2019,"Every once in a while there is a film that will blow you away from start to finish, in this case Lawrence of Arabia ins one of those very few films that will blow you away. For many years my grandfather enjoyed this film and suggested it to me for some time, finally being old enough to see it, I see why he and many others have enjoyed it. Epics are a kind of film that take an immense approach towards a story that needs a massive vision in order to tell such a story. David Lean took this massive vision in order to create something of epic scale and scope, which captured the extensiveness of an epic-genre film. Like most other epics, they take a great amount of time to tell their long stories, some ranging between three to five hours long which I will say may be too long for any kind of film. Lawrence of Arabia runs in at three hours and thirty-six minutes would seem like a rather long film, but this runtime feels appropriate when telling the progressional story of T.E. Lawrence building his character in great depth. Think of it like breaking the character of T.E. Lawrence into several parts such as a man, soldier, hero, leader, and advisor. In regards to the performances, Peter O'Toole brings T.E. Lawrence to life on multiple levels making us feel for his life journey and all other circumstances that he faces on that journey. All supporting and secondary performances adds a lot of good flare as well, especially from Omar Sharif's character. The direction by David Lean resonates every minute of this epic, Lean took such great care in creating a film of scale, meaning making this film both look and feel immense. Great utilization of wide lenses and shots allow the look of the film to larger than life, which in turn makes those particular shots more impactful.I would recommend this film to anyone, even if it were just one time. This film has been on many ""top films or greatest films of all times"", after seeing it I feel that this film justifies its placement on those lists.

368,saint#50,"To quote Rod Serling, ""this is one for the angels.""",10,20 September 1999,"This movie is long beyond legend and worth every frame.  Is T.E. Lawrence, the famous British officer and liberator of Saudi Arabia, serving his Queen and country or is he defecting to the Arabs?  Does he know what he's doing? Is he being driven to madness under the political strains he has accumulated, or is the bloodshed getting the better of him?  The movie poses innumerable questions about its hero, and then, quite perversely, doesn't see fit to answer them with any degree of explicitness.  What it does do is to leave many possibilities open for debate.  The film is almost four hours long (it its restored version), it features no females with speaking roles, it has a modicum of action, and the dialog is even sparse.  Yet, if ever a piece of film warranted multiple viewings it would have to be Lawrence of Arabia, the pinnacle of David Lean's career.

370,Natheer,The essence of cinema,10,15 April 2005,"One sure thing about this masterpiece it was done with great love for the subject, characters, place & the people of Arabia.David lean spent nearly 2 years in filming this picture, and the result = the greatest masterpiece in film history.The majestic landscape of the Arabian Peninsula combined with the majestic music by the genius Maurice jarred with a director vision, the combination of these three elements is a rare commodity through out the history of movie making.I believe that David Lean actually fell in love with the Arab and became another T.E. Lawrence. Practically, you can not do such marvelous work without great love and devotion. You probably saw a lot of the desert flicks, and I am sure most of them are stinkers. Because they lack a major value, respect to the natives and their way of life, I cant say that Lawrence of Arabia praised the Arabs, but he gave more than any film I can remember a wide range of characters that covers the whole human spectrum in any society, it do not have that cheap attitude towards the Arab as human beings as most of Hollywood films does.The 2 years spent in the desert played a major role in realistically studying the natural Bedouins in their natural environment and to learn their customs, manners and even their body language, this was obvious in the acting, also using real Bedouins as extras gave the film its distinguished flavor. The costumes was something I always admire in this move, the way they show the Arabic dress is dignifying, its not like those fantasy costumes that Hollywood uses frequently even in modern cinema (hidalgo for example).I think modern cinema lost its magic, although they are trying very hard not to, but they couldn't figure it out. its very simple the human factor is lost. Its not any more important like before, I can go further in saying actors became shallow, their real life is shallow and artificial and this is the human dilemma, the more technologically advanced and materially we become the less humans we became.Life is soul, and you can not pump life in a dead body.

Also, director David Lean and crew picked up more all-time top tens for this film than any other. So you might ask why it gets less sustained adulation than other top tens? As General Murray says in the film itself, the war in Arabia was ""a sideshow of a sideshow"", even at the time. Also, it has no parts for women, unless you count three seconds dragging off the mens' leftover food, and four seconds of ululating from a distant hillside. I suppose I can understand why female movie buffs are less enthralled by this all-guy war adventure than I am. Nevertheless, this all male cast put on a 'sideshow' which outshines all but (perhaps) a precious few films in all of cinematic history. The depth of character, the transcentental scope, the, well, every mystical art of film making is there for the viewer to drown in an ocean of genius, if they wish. I could wax on for an age about it all.I was only ten years of age when my mom took me to see this in 1962, and I was affected so utterly by Lawrence as David Lean and O'Toole created him, that I could not endure to see the film end after three hours. (The director's cut is longer for you lucky DVD owners). In the final reel, as Lawrence hitches a ride in a motorcar back to the port where he'll return to England, he sees a few Bedouins riding their camels and he takes a long look back once they pass. At that moment, knowing that, like Lawrence, I was about to leave the romance of war in the desert too, I felt a bond so complete that no hero would ever replace Lawrence of Arabia for me.

Lawrence, and his guide, after a long trek across the desert, stop at a well to drink. Lawrence turns around to see a distant speck in the far distance, reluctantly shimmering in the desert heat, like a mirage. The speck reluctantly approaches the camera, before materializing into what looks like a man. There is absolutely no music, only the sounds of the desert winds and the footsteps of the man approaching. What are his intentions? We do not know. But judging by the reaction of Lawrence's guide, they must not be good. The man comes closer to the camera, until the suspense becomes so unbearable that Lawrence's guide runs to the nearest weapon--only to be shot. On television, this shot doesn't work at all; nothing can be seen, nothing can be heard. In a movie theater, looking at the stark clarity projected on the screen, the sound of the desert surrounding us, we lean forward and strain to bring a detail out of the waves of heat, and for a moment we experience some of the actual vastness of the desert, and its unforgiving harshness. I myself have only experienced 4 movies in the theater: Lawrence of Arabia, which remains one of my favorite films, Shazam, which wasn't half bad, and Home, which was. My family also went to see the sequel to Percy Jackson, and quite frankly, the first one wasn't even that good. And despite the fact that these movies may not be very good, the experience of watching it in the theater was enough to make them a memorable experience. Unfortunately, despite having huge blockbusters last year, ticket sales have been going down the past few years, and, given the current circumstances, it is unlikely that new generations will be able to experience the magic of the cinema.",Lawrence of Arabia

379,MidniteRambler,Simultaneously personal and panoramic,10,23 May 2004,"Sweeping, epic and literate version of British adventurer and soldier T E Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during the First World War. Lawrence, miraculously well played by Peter O'Toole, ""went native"" when sent into the desert to find Alec Guinness's Prince Feisal. Before long he was striking out himself against the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which still held sway in the region at the beginning of the last century. Lawrence's efforts to unify the various Arab factions are particularly prescient.Lawrence became an inspirational warlord whose neutral presence amongst the Arab tribes, lead by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn, amongst others, served to glue together shifting and uneasy alliances. As well as wrestling with himself, with his own demons, and with the cruel desert environment, the Englishman was also faced with culture clashes which pitted not only the imperialists against the indigenous populations, but also the mercenary practices of the Arab guerillas against the discipline of the British army. In the end, Lawrence himself does not know which side he is on, nor which party he belongs to. Set against a backdrop of the Arabian desert, the nomadic allies under Lawrence's direction, attack and disrupt the Turks' efforts to maintain control of the territory, whilst the elephant - the British army and its heavy guns under General Jack Hawkins - pushes ever deeper into the area: not until his job is done does Lawrence learn that the French and British governments have carved up the middle-east between them and that the battle-lines for the 21st century are already being drawn.Scripted by the inimitable Robert Bolt and directed by David Lean, Lawrence of Arabia is one of those films without a weakness, despite drawing complaints for its near four hour length. The dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack and especially direction are superlative; likewise the supporting actors. But it is O'Toole at his charismatic best who steals the show in his starring debut; he never looked back. It may take an effort to watch this movie, but is well worth the ride and will, by the bye, provide some insight into the fractious and volatile world of Arab politics. One of the best films ever made.",Lawrence of Arabia

(Restored to brilliance in the 50th Anniversary BluRay edition) Gorgeous soundtrack, with its familiar, enigmatic theme. Spectacularly bravura and camp performance by eye-lined Peter O'Toole (of whom Noel Coward noted, ""If he'd been any more beautiful they'd have had to rename it 'Florence of Arabia.'"" (Omar Shariff may have had the same eye-liner clause in his contract, BTW.) I wanted to watch this with the family a) to see a movie classic and b) to see how the story of Britain's carving up of the middle-east post Ottoman empire was presented and finally c) to revisit the story of a remarkable (and controversial) man. The first thing to note is the length of the film - 3 hours and 18 minutes. Blimey! You're not gonna take this one in one sitting. The second is that you may struggle with the plot and context if you don't gen up before (or while) you're watching. e.g. Q: The Arab Bureau? A: A department of the Foreign Office responsible for overseeing the political machinations of the regional players; Turks, France, Britain, local Arab emirs, independent tribes and whose representative decides to support the maverick Lawrence. If you don't know he'd been an Academic already in Arabia for two years or more, spoke fluent Arabic, was well respected by the locals and so on, you might wonder why the Arab Bureau was keen on having him work for them. Indeed, the historical accuracy is very variable, so don't expect a well structured history lesson. There were some hefty arguments at the time about the content, and how it portrayed the film's prime antagonists. What it does very well is show the brilliant madness of a man obsessed with his own destiny and special nature. This is probably an accurate representation of Lawrence, at least it concurs with what he autobiogrpahically wrote in his 7 Pillars of Wisdom. But in watching it, you too will probably be puzzled by his motivation - why he takes many of the actions he does. Questions remain about Lawrence's sexuality and the film makes nods in this direction as well as his potential sadism, for example when we see him apparently revelling in unnecessary killing (instead of taking prisoners). Lawrence clearly was an extraordinary man and Peter O'Toole's performance was pretty darned amazing. But for me the narrative doesn't hold up. It's fragmented and sporadic and fails to give the personal or historical insight it deserves. The panoramic shots of expansive desert are indulgently long, as is the whole film.So, a ground breaking, historical film, with some outstanding performances and truly stunning photography. But it is flawed in its accuracy and proportions and is unlikely to get a great deal of attention from future generations other than film aficionados, for whom it will continue to be a classic and formative.",Lawrence of Arabia

Half of it's brilliance was that it took me by surprise by being quite an intelligent, and sometimes dark character study. It is however, first and foremost an epic and it does live up to it- it has so many visual moments- people approaching from the wide empty deserts, full scale charges, exploding trains, and of course, the stark beauty of the desert.

It's not easy to tell the story of the Arab uprising against the Turks and the Ottoman Empire, especially during this fragmented time period in World War I
The script by Robert Bolt paints an accurate and painful portrait of T.E. Lawrence, both the good and the bad. The source material is both""The Revolt in the Desert"" and ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"".
The music is a multidimensional character that enhances every scene where it is used. Maurice Jarre has given us a juggernaut of a score. He can write the major musical interludes for a Symphony Orchestra or a Military marching band. He can even write music for the ancient Arabian stringed instruments that echo the unheard sounds of the desert.
This is Peter O'Toole's first major film part. As David Lean said during his screen test, ""Stop, the boy is Lawrence!"" O'Toole doesn't disappoint.
Jack Hawkins as Allenby, Anthony Quayle as Brighton, Omar Sharif as Sherif Ali, Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tay, Arthur Kennedy as Jackson Bentley (actually Lowell Thomas and Alec Guinness as Prince Fiesel all give Oscar caliber performances. But let's talk about the Production Design, which may never be surpassed even using CGI. Lean had his staff and local Spanish labor construct the city of Aquaba, right down to the last of three hundred plaster buildings, all done in an ancient riverbed on the coast of Spain. Just for good measure, they built a complete Army camp for the Turkish army. Lawrence and his Arab army destroy the Turkish camp and army and then ""take their boots"".
As a yardstick, Steven Spielberg was asked what this picture would cost to make in today's dollars. Without missing a beat, Spielberg said $260,000,000.

386,WNYer,Simply the Best,10,16 October 2012,"Epic biography of English colonel TE Lawrence who led the Arab revolt against the Turks during World War One.My candidate for greatest movie ever made. Superbly crafted in every way; sterling performances from the cast, a literate script by Robert Bolt, dazzling camera work by Freddie Young, detailed production design by John Box and a beautiful music score by Maurice Jarre. It is all seamlessly assembled together by director David Lean in a masterwork.The story follows Lawrence's un-military like beginning as a mapmaker in Cairo at the start of the war and his subsequent mission for the Arab bureau to report on the Arab revolt in the desert. While there, he gets the factional tribes to unite and gradually assumes command leading them on a series of daring military raids against the Turks which lead to his fame and legend.Then unknown, Peter O'Toole plays the lead and carries the film in a star making performance. He is ably supported by newcomer Omar Sharif in a large supporting role and a who's who list of seasoned performers. Claude Rains as a dapper politician, Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal and Anthony Quinn as a fierce Arab warrior, Auda come off best but there is really not a false note in the entire group - everyone is solid.Leans previous editing experience is also on frequent display in the film as he composes his shots with the discerning eye of an editor and it shows in almost every scene; blowing out the match and transitioning to the rising desert sun, the dazzling motorcycle ride thru the English countryside during the opening sequence, Sheriff Ali's mirage-like emergence from the desert at the water well - its just one great scene after another.It is also a rare film that while epic in scale it never loses the intimate details of the characters or story - always holding your attention despite a length of almost four hours. The story itself still maintains relevance as it shows the factional nature of the middle east who's countryman are able to unite during war against a common enemy but can't keep it together while at peace.Anyway, watch this movie on the largest screen you can with the best sound system you can and prepare yourself for a mesmerizing journey through the desert.",Lawrence of Arabia

388,eddie_olsen,Historical epic of all time!,10,9 June 2009,"In the years of the big historical epic films, from 1957-1964, some of the most spectacular and costly films in Hollywood history were made. The creators lay much effort in an accurate depiction of the time the film was set in. A large fraction of those films where set in the Roman empire. These films, with standard features like a horse race, a gladiator combat, etc. have grown out of favor (not me!).The most of 'Lawrence of Arabia' is set in the desert, avoiding the extravagance of Roman empire epics. There is no shining marble here. When Lawrence is asked ""What is it that you find so fascinating about the desert?"", he answers ""It's clean"". The sand dunes make a clean and yet exotic backdrop to the drama. This is one of the reasons why 'Lawrence of Arabia' doesn't look dated.By any measure, the acting of Peter O'Toole is superb. His somewhat twisted and high tempered acting fits like a glove. Who can imagine any other playing the Godfather than Marlon Brando? Same thing here. Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins....who can ask for more? And of course, there is no real epic from the desert without Omar Sharif. The entire cast is rock solid! However, this is the early 60's and the movie screen was very much a theater stage in contrast to films today where the acting melts more seamlessly into the action. This may be a barrier for some.'Lawrence of Arabia' is a full night's entertainment, almost 4 hours. I love it! The story is told in a continuous time line with no flashbacks or side stories. To make a 4 hrs straight time line drama work is hard, but done right it's pure joy to watch. There is a climax every 30-45 minutes and the timing of the highs and lows are perfect.Most people will recognize the orchestral music after three tones. Avoiding fanfares and other features so typical for Roman epics, the music is grand and sweeping, but never boring. The main theme is developed through the film in various ways. Bits of oriental tunes adds the right atmosphere.Historical epics are not for everyone. 'Lawrence of Arabia' will surprise many new viewers because it doesn't fall into the same category as Ben-Hur, Spartacus and Cleopatra. If the age of the film is not an issue for you, it's a must see.",Lawrence of Arabia
389,RushRhees,Feast for lovers of complexity,9,22 July 2003,"Lawrence of Arabia is a film that takes its characters seriously. Instead of creating stable characters performing different functions during the film, David Lean has succeeded in telling a story about a complex world, with complex people dwelling in it.The protagonist, Lawrence, is a man who is forever oscillating between self-doubt and hubris. He wants to create a place in the world for himself. We see his wish for becoming accepted as an equal amongst the Bedouin people. In being a great warrior, leading the Bedouin to Aqba and Damascus, he seems to have been successful. But things are not so easy. He comes to have doubts about his identity, and his project of 'becoming an Arab'. He wants to change, but there are many questions to be asked. How is it possible to change? Is he not naive in trying to get the people around him to accept him as a full-worthy member of the group?The film reveals the dark sides of self-scrutiny and deception. Lawrence remains a very human paradox; he can be said to be both very conscious about himself, and still he somehow seems to deceive himself in striving mostly for Honor and acceptance (in opposition to e.g. friendship and love). In an magnificent way, we get to see how friendship and love between men are destroyed by the blind (but conscious) desire for Honor and position. Shall we say that Lawrence was corrupted? Or shall we say that he finally realized something about himself? I don't know.Lawrence of Arabia tells a story about the fragility of love and friendship. This is a story that opens many interesting perspectives on person-hood, identity and morality. What makes this film a masterpiece, is that it forces the viewer to think for herself.

390,addiewhiz,Simply the Best!,10,27 December 2011,"I have had the privilege of watching some of the greatest films ever made. However, of all of those films, none have been quite able to match the simply magnificent splendor of ""Lawrence of Arabia"". I strongly believe that this is the greatest film ever made. I'll begin with the dialog. Every conversation and line of dialog in this film is so precisely crafted and so memorable. The film begins by showing how the title character, Thomas Edward Lawrence dies. At his funeral, a reporter is walking around talking to various characters that will later be shown to be of significance in the story. Two of these characters are British Generals Murray and Allenby. Both of them claim to have not known him well. This scene perfectly sets the stage for the story. A story about a man who was mysterious, strange and seldom understood by those around him, particularly his peers in the British Army. The director, Sir David Lean, also does an excellent job in casting each and every one of the characters, especially the main character, T.E. Lawrence himself. Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Lawrence is absolutely spectacular, as he is able to make it such that Lawrence's behavior and actions are uniquely in tune with his circumstances, while still transcending all of it. If I were to go into how amazing the casting of the other characters is as well, this review would go well beyond the IMDb word limit. One of the most striking elements of this film is the cinematography. Not many films are this successful at immersing the audience into the environment of the story. The spectacular views of the desert in this film make the viewer feel as though they are going through this adventure with Lawrence, and make the entire experience feel so much more real.

393,Glen-5,Totally Unmoving.,6,11 November 2002,"I rate this movie 6 out of 10. This is hardly the greatest movie of all time as others have written here. I'd be hard pressed to call it one of the greats.   Of course, there is much subjectivity in any of these types of judgments.   My opinion is partly based on the fact that I am seeing this movie for the first time now in 2002.   Had I been born (and old enough) to appreciate this movie during it's 1962 release, I suspect I would have rated it higher back then.  I'm sure things that were breakthroughs and outstanding back in the 1962 release of this film would have improved my opinion of it had I seen it then.    On the same token, I suspect movies that I've seen in recent years which I've given one rating now, may change slightly (maybe even significantly) over the years. Perhaps I did get off on the wrong foot with this movie in the beginning.  I did not find it very artistic, moving, or stirring to have the interminably long period of black screen with the soundtrack playing at the beginning of this film (on DVD).   Then the very first scene set me off with a negative impression.  In this scene we see T.E. Lawrence riding his motor bike down the road at a VERY high rate of speed WITHOUT his hair being blown back, or blown about in the slightest bit, other than from the up and down motion of whatever he was sitting on when they filmed this scene.    Surely one could say that he is wearing some pretty strong hair spray, gel, grease, whatever, but nothing could be so strong as to have his hair not move at all while traveling so fast on a motorbike.   Okay so those are fairly minor flaws of which there aren't many in this film.   The main reason I didn't rate this movie higher was because this movie (the story) didn't really move me in any way.  It didn't elicit any strong emotions in me one way or another whether it be sadness, happiness, fear, intrigue, wonder, nostalgia, anything.  There was hardly even a sense of adventure (to me).   In some ways it was dryer than watching an old PBS documentary.  I also found the storyline somewhat disjointed, and the ending very dull and incomplete.  So dull, ordinary, and incomplete that it was unexpected.  If not for the words 'The End', I would not have thought the film was over. Although I must say that I was sort of glad that it was. 
Anyhow, I suppose certain people rate their movies primarily on the artistic value of how well the film was made.  I take that into consideration, but my ratings have a lot to do with how good the story is and how the movie makes me feel.  A great story poorly made will get low marks.  A boring story, nicely made will get mediocre marks from me.   This movie fits the latter. I did not come away from this movie with a sense of ""Wow, that was fantastic"", but more of a sense of ""Eh, that was okay"". 
If not for the fine acting and cinematography, I would have given this movie 4/10.   Because this movie does have merit in it's style and acting, and the breakthroughs made for its 1962 release I decided to give it 6/10.",Lawrence of Arabia

From stunning shots of Turkish by-planes attacking an Arab camp to the Arab forces sacking the Turkish controlled city of Arabak, every shot is carefully and masterfully constructed.  Steven Spielberg adds comment to the DVD version of the film. In this commentary, he raves of the editing.  In retrospect, this is what makes this film so lovely.  The shots are wonderful.  Yet, in addition, these shots are wonderfully arranged.In today's cinema, Lawrence of Arabia would have been perhaps 2 to 2 ½ hours long - had it been greenlighted at all.  Today's audiences, and moreover producers, do not have the patience for the mood of a film to be slowly captured between main plot development (notice the box office failure of Magnolia or Meet Joe Black).  Sure we can sit through a 3+-hour film - think Titanic - but there was always action, the story continued to thrust forward.  Lawrence had about 2 ½ hours of deliberate forward moving story - the other hour is mood, atmosphere, and the soul of the story.  Titanic had three hours and fifteen minutes of story to tell - or close to it.Besides our reluctance to accept the long unfolding of a story.  Lawrence of Arabia would not have been produced the way it was for technical reasons. Lean uses pan shots to capture the vast desert as seen from far away mountains.  Today much of this would have been computer generated.  The countless number of extras used in battle sequences would have also been created using digital trickery.  Now, none of this is pointed out to bash modern cinema  -- I love today's filmmaking.  No, this more of a comment on the way movies are made today. While Battleship Potemkin (1925) is a visual splendor and breakthrough of a film, it still would not be told that way today - or even in the day of Lawrence of Arabia.  Why should it be?  We have sound today.  Likewise Lawrence's grand scenes would not be told the same way anymore.  Why should they be?  We have digital animation.Lawrence of Arabia, the film and the man, is a one of a kind.  Peter O' Toole captures this stunning historical figure with much style.  Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and Omar Shariff are equally splendid in supporting roles.  Lawrence's character traits are well examined through O' Toole's portrayal and the others' reactions to him.  Apparently, the script took some liberties with history, which would have also worked against it today.  I say nonsense though.  Historical dramas are just that - drama.  Liberties will be taken and these liberties can serve as a launch point for intellectual discussion on the historical topic. Otherwise, it is the filmmaker's tale to tell.  The only time when historical inaccuracies are particularly deplorable is when the film is touted as good history.Lawrence of Arabia is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word.  A technical and visual tour de force.  It is a good story that is well told and well acted.  And like all true masterpieces of the cinema, it could not be captured again the same way.",Lawrence of Arabia
399,sdrake2-53-373531,"Overblown, overrated, and sincerely just a boring movie!",1,21 June 2011,"David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is considered a full out classic. it is widely respected everywhere, on numerous top ten best films ever made lists, and has received four star reviews everywhere. I watched this film because a friend recommended it to me. i sat down, ready and willing to watch it because of all the praise it had received. About an hour later, i was about to fall asleep. nothing was happening at all. i do enjoy many long films (Dances With Wolves, Titanic, etc.), but the fact that this film lasts about three hours and forty minutes is asinine. Why does this film about a guy that hardly anyone has heard about have to be this long/ I know why! Because all that was on the film makers minds was "" I wonder how many Oscars I can get with this film."" The Academy loves epic, and this sure was an epic. A seriously flawed epic. First of all is the length. All of this material could have been shown in a matter of 2 and a half hours, if only the script writer had cut out unnecessary dialogue. second, is how Peter O' Toole portrayed Lawrence. Apparently this character is a man who gets a rush by killing people. but, instead of giving the viewers a portrait of why this character has this issue, it instead shows shots of as much desert land as possible. Third of all, this film did not make me leave with a sort of meaning or purpose. All I left with was questions that could have been answered if only It had a better script. now, there are some aspects of the film that saved it from being a one star. That is Alec Guiness's performance as prince Feisal. He is, as always, brilliant. The rollicking score. It left me humming the theme for days. and third is the editing. my favorite is when lawrence blows out the match and it cuts straight to the red sunrise.",Lawrence of Arabia
400,dimonosads,Masterpiece,10,10 January 2012,"""Lawrence of the Arabia"" is not historically-accurate movie as one may think, judging by the title. However, it manages to prove itself as one of the greatest movie classics ever created.First of all, the movie achieves to portrait the vast landscapes, where the story takes place, in an adventurous and even romantic colors. The cinematography shots are definitely at its' peak in this movie. One may even feel like time-traveling back to those glorious events with the protagonist just to watch the beauty of the scenery that lies ahead of him or her.Second, the acting is mind-blowing, giving depth to the characters involved in the historical saga. Sometimes, it might be difficult to understand whether you see a real life person in front of you with incredibly complex character or is it just an actor portraying him. Anyone can clearly see how the values of main heroes affect every tiny bit of their difficult decisions.Third, the plot is not only perfectly executed, but is tightly connected to the scenery and personal struggle to make every single dream they have to come true. Actually, the events that take place make probably even more impact on main characters, leading to the final titles of the movie.Finally, the movie has one of the most memorable soundtracks, that will lie deeply in many hearts. Only a truly epic tale deserves to have such wonderful music.To cut the story short, this is a masterpiece created by David Lean. Forget about history for a while. Enjoy the movie.",Lawrence of Arabia
401,el_master,The Best Film of All Time,10,2 November 2003,"It is certainly, in my point of view, the best film, it is my favorite one. why?, it's simple, it has no flaws, the actors are excellent, the screenplay, everything!Sir David Lean, deserves a mention on this. I do believe that his direction and constant perfectionism, helped to make this magic film. Also I think that the edition part plays one of the major roles in the film. it was a wit editing, and sometimes influential one. Whatever else I might say about this movie, it has no need to be said.It is excellence. and excellence must be look upon always!",Lawrence of Arabia
402,iain_connell,Still my personal favourite,10,26 January 2005,"I first saw this film on its release, aged 13, and it forms an important part of my transition towards adulthood. I am pleased to see that it consistently rates 20something in the IMDb listings, even from others (whom I envy, for I can't see it with fresh eyes) who are seeing it for the first time. Pleasing too is that some of those are also teenagers, for whom a forty-three year old film must itself seem part of the past. As for the minority who are bored by intentionally slow pacing (and for whom punctuation, paragraphing and grammar are a lost art), I suggest they learn a little about the history of film-making (from which it may become apparent that much of today's fast editing techniques were invented in the 1920s: try Eisenstein's October, for example).From the universally admired cinematography of Freddie Young, the long shot of Omar Sharif's floating mirage entry, the pre-CGI battles and pan-up scene changes, to O'Toole's florid but career-defining performance and the (then) novel time-shift narrative, this film set standards not matched even by Lean himself, and, as many reviewers have commented, financially and practically unlikely to be attempted today. I too have rarely seen such clarity of image outside of Imax, and in my view the script by Robert Bolt (and I now have learnt, an uncredited Michael Wilson) is the finest in cinema. Maurice Jarre's music and some of the acting style now seem a little excessive, but repeated viewing (around 35 times in my case) does not diminish the impact and quality, and the restoration and now DVD release still, after all these years, approaches the effect of that first 1962 viewing.It is rare that repeated watching of a film (as opposed to a live performance) does this, and the reasons go beyond the photography, performances and editing. In my opinion, it is because the characterisation and storytelling encourage an appreciation of the ambiguity and inconsistency behind our motives and behaviour, and, in a wartime scenario, in the contrast between political expedience and personal morality. For a 13-year old, this opened a window into the adult world, and it explains why the story has resonance far beyond its setting. The film doesn't require an understanding of middle-east politics (though it does have some very current relevance), but it does require an ability to look, listen and understand. The fact that so many people rate it so highly says everything about its wider impact. When The Matrix and even Lord of the Rings have slipped out of the ratings (and the adolescents who inhabit these pages have grown up), I believe this film will still be in the 20s or 30s, perhaps enabling young people to once again see the world through adult eyes.Like Ali, I fear Lawrence. I fear the power of art to change us, to challenge our preconceptions. Every time I see this film I learn a little more, discover something new. When I was 13 I didn't understand much, but this film helped me to see that I wanted more, knew more, than my peers. I can't rate it more highly than that.",Lawrence of Arabia
403,Aidan_Mclaren,This movie insults my intelligence,5,7 May 2006,"Where to begin...oh yes This movie is like a piece of coal in a box covered with with beautiful wrapping. Looks great on the outside but when you open it, it is completely worthless and puts a frown on your face, exactly what I got with this movie.The director primarily decided that with movies, cinematography is best, everything else is secondary, especially dialog. There were very few lines in a movie of mammoth length, which is absolutely pathetic. I was not able to connect with either Lawrence, his friends or his enemies. The film became lazy hiding behind a beautiful shroud of desert and camels.Let me say this, movies are stories to be told. Cinematography is crucial to this, but if you add very little story to one, it becomes a hollow log that appeases to people who love vision only enjoyed by the eye. I am not from that crowd unfortunately.Here are some thing that could have made this a masterpiece:1. Less time filming treks through the desert...This got on quite a few people's nerve, despite the beautiful scenery we saw. We became bored and disconnected with Lawrence, like as if the long journey told an important story.2. Include more dialog... This is perhaps the worst part of the film, there wasn't any stuff to think about other than ""I will do this job, yes"". Through only Lawrence's actions, we could only determine that he fell in love with two Arabs going on a maverick's job to capture a Turkish hold, he killed a man who he saved earlier for murdering an Arab and was first reluctant but then enjoyed it? Never going into detail why. He gets abused by turks and...without any thought dialog other than a couple of expressions and the audience knowing he got abused, how he became so cold and angry? 3. Try to be a bit more historically accurate if you don't care about story...This film was more like an amalgam of bits than a movie or history lesson. They didn't even include captions or dates to inform the audience how Britain came to be affaired with the campaign or Lawrence's past history.And to top it all off, a cheesy ending with a bunch of soldiers driving by in a truck singing on how they miss home, obviously saying that Lawrence will miss the middle-east, but we never became connected with why he will miss it so much.A huge disappointment of a movie. Yet a good example of cinematography, how long a movie should be (movies should be very long) and a good cast selection. But other than that it was more of a pretty picture with tons of money bursting out the frames.5/10",Lawrence of Arabia
404,chunga95,Why this classic is THE classic.,10,5 January 2009,"On the IMDb discussion boards a few years ago, someone asked what made ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (LofA) such an important movie. The poster had watched the film but was left scratching his head as to why this was such a significant and revered movie. If you have seen the movie and are asking yourself the same questions, hopefully this will help.You might have wondered why this movie lasts almost four hours with an intermission. When LofA was made, going to the cinema to watch a movie was a bigger deal than it is now. It was commonplace for movies to last this long, and lengthy epics with a cast-of-a-thousand were the flavor. This is the only significant quality this movie shares with other contemporary movies of the time.Obviously, this movie takes place in the Middle East. As far as western audiences were concerned, LofA might as well have taken place on the moon for all that was understood of Arabian culture and history in 1962. LofA transports us to an alien land with strange characters and values. To help tell this story, the movie is anchored by established actors like Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, and Claude Rains. While Hawkins and Rains perform familiar characters, Guinness and Quinn paint credible portraits as Arabic royalty and tribal leader. That their characterizations still ring true today is a testament to their portrayals. Only in the last 10 years or so has western cinema begun to maturely portray Middle Eastern culture. Omar Sharif, one of the few actual Middle Easterners with a prominent role, demonstrates the complex beauty and brutality of this culture.Of course the real star was newcomer Peter O'Toole. His was a risky casting and proved to be one of the best of all time. The real genius of LofA is its simplicity. Here is the man Lawrence, here is what happened, here's how he felt about it all. This is made possible by O'Toole. At the time, campy presentational acting was still the prominent style of movie acting. O'Toole was part of the new blood of method acting, made en vogue famously by Brando and ""On the Waterfront"", that was showing the audience, not telling, the emotional fabric of a character. Watch O'Toole's eyes on his close-ups. He communicates more depth and presence than any dialog could provide. He draws the audience in, includes them in his triumphs and despairs, all the while impressing the hope and ambition of Lawrence.Steering the ship is David Lean. He makes nearly every minute of the movie matter. An important part of the story is the environment of LofA, the desert. It's such an integral part that Lean treats the desert as a character. Lean takes the audience to another world to show how the desert is a huge factor to the method of madness Lawrence finds there; why a man is killed simply for drinking from a water well, why Lawrence is the Giver of Life, why crossing the desert for gold is honorable, why it is important that Arabia be ruled by Arabians, not the British or Turks. There's a scene where Lawrence is crossing the Devil's Anvil. In that sequence Lean includes a shot of a dust devil (the tornado-looking thing) spinning fiercely on the baked ground. If this movie were made today, a CGI-artist would make this. Of course CGI didn't exist in '62, but nonetheless Lean patiently set up in the desert to capture this phenomenon and include it. It's a small color, but important the vast and vibrant world he communicates.If this movie were made today, it would be filled with snappy dialog and probably focus on big action sequences. Lean makes every minute of the movie matter because everything that happens serves the characters. The movie lasts nearly four hours, not because that was the style of movies in that era, but because it takes that long to diligently explore the characters of Lawrence, Feisal, Sheriff Ali, and abu Tayi. Lean's direction and crafting was revolutionary. The movie stills holds currency in our modern culture because the movie's direction, acting, and characterizations ARE timeless and of no particular era.There are a thousand variables that make a great movie, but if you're looking for the important qualities to latch on to, it's how this movie is timeless. This movie was a radical departure from the hammy ""epics"" of the time and set a nearly unreachable standard for every movie that follows. It was great in 1962, great today, and will be great in 50 years.",Lawrence of Arabia

406,jcjacob-37009,The GREATEST Epic Ever Made!!!,10,28 March 2017,"Lawrence of Arabia (1962), is possibly the Best Film ever made in the Epic Genre. The film is directed by David Lean (Steven Spielberg's Mentor), who has made another Best Picture and Director win in the 1957 Classic, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Lawrence of Arabia stars Peter O'Toole and Alec Guinness. Lean is very unique, especially when it comes down to the cut of a scene, rather than a fade. Lean uses these methods to make the film more engaging instead of putting the audience on hold.One thing that I love about this movie is not just the sand, desert, costumes or camels, but mostly the Cinematography. The Scope of this film is gigantic in every way. The filmmakers used a special anamorphic lens to enhance the scale of the desert, which is breath- taking to the audience. The Scenes that were filmed are all real. David Lean had to wait for the right moment for the weather to hit its' mark.The movie is 3 hrs. long, with an Intermission, but it's worth the watch. Lawrence of Arabia is the kind of film that should be made today. Definitely in my Top 5 Favorite Films List!",Lawrence of Arabia
407,Guffa,Simply a superb masterpiece,10,11 November 1999,"It truly is british from top to bottom. Well made from the beginning to the end with essential craftmanship and so utterly polished that it outshines almost any other movie in the world, grand and bombastic from overture to end-credits, beautifully filmed in Panavision 70 with lots of colossal mammoth-like scenes. Yet it is touching in a way big screen epics almost never are, or never were. For this motion picture is not just a production grande, it is also an intament tale of a human being.The character development is wonderful, the views are terrifficly awesome(as widescreen-version on a fair TV or, preferably, at the cinema), the music is as stunning as it is suggestive and the acting is rock-solid.I have no complaints about this movie, none whatsoever. It's so wonderful, you couldn't ask for anything else in a motion picture than you can find in this one(except women, of course!!!).

It is one of those few films that is an Absolute Classic.  Long as it might be, there's no fat here, and and is easily in league with the other giants of cinema; Seven Samurai, The Godfather, etc.  I prefer this film over Dr. Zhivago, that type of melodrama is absent from this film as we watch Lawrence unfold.  There's a lot of quotable material in this movie too, Auda Abu Tayi's character has many great moments and the screenplay by Robert Bolt is one that can be studied for years to come, while remaining very accessible.There's really just too much to go into here in these little columns, we got armies and armies, train wrecks, obsession, imperfection, a ton of Arabs with camels, even a couple strafing biplanes!  Not to mention Alec Guiness, and in essence a ""Birth of a Nation"" story.This is a film along the likes of classic literature: having this volume of film on your shelves is akin to Hemingway, Tolstoy, Dickens, or, you know, whatever you might like to see in a big, dusty, hardbound book on the shelf in some spooky library.",Lawrence of Arabia

Lawrence as he'd intended. The results would have been horrendous, especially the way Brando was behaving on film sets in the early 1960s.The scenery (Yes, the desert can be beautiful!), performances, & script, not to mention Maurice Jarre's magnificent, timeless score, all tie together to make a film that requires countless viewings.  However, the real star of the film is not Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, or any of the famed international cast . . . but Lawrence himself.

411,Robert R Jackson,Epics don't get any bigger.,10,8 June 2002,"David Lean was born to direct ""big"" films. His mastery of working with his DP to compose for the widescreen aspect ratio still stands as the definitive work in the idiom. Of his three most ambitious films; The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Lawrence Of Arabia (1962) and Dr. Zhivago (1965); this stands out as his most flawless accomplishment. It's a shame that all the audio tracks were lost to the ravages of time. Just two years before his death, Lean re-assembled the original cast in 1989 to replace *all* the dialogue when he set about restoring the film. That he was able to pull it off is quite a feat, but it's a shame to have lost all the original production dialogue. The restored film is a wonder, though. Almost every frame looks like a beautiful still photograph. The images that play across the screen are a wonder to behold and the skill with which the film is assembled is genius. Shots follow each other and build with a purpose and structure beyond the abilities of most filmmakers. And the story. The character of T.E. Lawrence is a misfit. He's not understood by the Arabs and he's not understood by the British. O'Toole's performance as Lawrence is powerful and poignant. Forty years after its initial release Lawrence of Arabia is more impressive than ever. It is one of the true wonders of 20th Century cinema.",Lawrence of Arabia

The acting is perfect, the script is perfect, the idea is perfect, it is basically perfection.But of everything in this film, I would like to point out one thing: Unlike other people, T. E. Lawrence doesn't like the number of people he has killed. It is acted out perfectly in this, and I'm guessing it is how T. E. Lawrence felt about killing those people.Many people have said it, and I'll say it again, as many other people will say it again and again: This is the greatest movie ever made, period.

The visuals are breathtaking, and the musical score is no less rousing.Similarly triumphant are the performances of Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, and most of all Peter O'Toole. O'Toole utterly captures the audience with his portrayal of TE Lawrence. He becomes Lawrence, complete with pomp and quirk in one of the defining performances of cinematic history. To ignore the supporting cast is neglectful however. They were all flawless.Billed as an action movie, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA far transcends such classification. The astounding depths of the many layers of this film delve into serious consideration of war, politics, history, and humanity. Each action and each spoken word hold true meaning. Each scene is laid out with an air of importance. Despite this, the movie never feels heavy, and never drags on.

414,xaleber,A miracle of a film! The true definition of an epic,9,5 January 2017,"I am not one of the guys who can sit and watch a 3 hrs epic film just like that. I have to be in a proper mood and have to be willing to get on a journey or an adventure, if you will, to another place and time. Happily, the conditions were right for me to watch an epic and I did watch Lawrence. A lot of things were intriguing about that film: The amazing cinematography, the framing of shots, the impeccable crowd control, and, you know, all the technical stuff. Although not as good as Lawrence's, these qualities are present in other epics as well. What really drew me into the film was T.E Lawrence's character in the film. Usually in epics, the characters take a back seat for the sake of the action or events. But here we see this intimate personal story of a man who, for some reason, challenges and tests himself: Burning his hand with the matchstick, standing in front of a man firing bullets towards him and almost killing him, and constantly going to dangerous battles with the Arabs. For what? He's not doing it for his country and most probably not for the Arabs. He is trying to prove something to himself about himself. He is a deeply self-destructive character and to have such small exquisite story of a man within the epic canvas of the wars and the desert is just extraordinary. I can't believe that Sam Spiegel really took a chance on this madly genius (and very risky) film. I give credit to him, to Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson for the amazing screenplay, to the terrific Peter O Toole and Omar Sharif and , of course, to the man himself, one of cinema's greatest filmmaking artists, Mr. David Lean.",Lawrence of Arabia

416,amplicqu,Deftly handled economies of scale by Lean,9,28 March 2019,"Lean handles the desert as co-star with O'Toole as Ford did Monument Valley with his Western epics and Wayne. But Lean does it better.
Lawrence goes in an idealistic innocent, a brilliant but naive man who believes he can unite long conflicted tribal societies into a single, powerful group that could work themselves out of the colonial reign of Britain.
He discovers corruption and murder in other men, as well as in himself. By the time an Arab conference fails to unite the tribes, Lawrence is a shattered man. He has personally lost close friends, learned to love killing, been debased. He'd hoped to open doors for a people and place he learned to love, but manages to ruin himself.
O Toole, Sharif, even Quinn at his hammiest before Zorba, do amazing work, with pristine supporting roles by Claude Rains and Alec Guinness.

Imagine....there are actors in front of the camera and there is nothing being spoken...sometimes for minutes on end.. the mind boggles!!!! The part at the well, when Omar Sharif first makes his appearance coming in from the desert like a mirage, is one of the most audacious pieces of filming that I have ever seen at the movies.

Some people have criticized it for being overly long.... but I was sorry when the lights came up and I had to leave the Cinema. I even went back to see it twice....I think if I were pushed to put my money on the table, I would have to say that it is the greatest big screen movie ever: and, in my (very) humble opinion, David Lean is the greatest director!!",Lawrence of Arabia
422,daniel1974nl,Moviemaking cannot become possibly any better than this,10,1 July 2002,"Absolutely amazing, perhaps thats the only thing that can be sayed about this movie. I have (thank God) seen the fully restored version of this great film, on DVD. Really great people do these things for the real filmlovers as I am. I never saw the movie, only heard of its legendary status, so I brought the DVD blind. I never regretted that, since after this one I never saw a better movie again, and I wonder if I ever will.LOA is especially beautifull in the way its so detailed, look at the sand that blowing over the ground, making the it a bit hazy, so great.
There are to many memorable moments in this film, and to discuss them all will be a good thing to write a book about since the amount of space here will be to short. Just have a look yourself, Im sure you will love it. One thing be sure you watch the longest version you can find - Here thats the 217 minutes version, what is nearly the entire film. All of the rest will be a waste of your time, cos you will miss to many beautifull cinematic highlights. If only movies like this were still be made........................!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a quaility Hollywood would deliver then.",Lawrence of Arabia

Yes, as well as Albert Finney and that made a lot more sense but it was Albert Finney who said, have you considered Peter O'Toole? Who? - Yes, I love that story. It goes to prove that certain things are meant to happen. I'm sorry if I'm going on about it. But I saw Lawrence Of Arabia for the nth time in a 70mm print in a crowded theater and what came across as the one major reason this film will be relevant forever is Peter O'Toole. His performance is timeless because it is unique. Cinematic and theatrical but always true. David Lean brilliantly created a sense of intimacy in O'Toole's eyes within the vast, arid landscape. I know the film has its detractors. I heard once director Michael Apted call it a ""silly movie"" Wow, I had Michael Apted's quote in my mind when I saw the film last and for the life of me, I don't know what he meant. I love this film.",Lawrence of Arabia
424,bogartcagney19,Lawrence of Arabia is not a classic,4,30 May 2010,"There's good acting, good cinematography, and good music, but it's just too long, boring, and painful to watch! It's nowhere near as epic as Lord of the Rings, but it's only considered ""epic"" because of the fact that there was no film like this back then, and the fact that the director was so ambitious and wanted to cram in all this crap that this movie accumulated the length of 4 hours to do so. It's also too slow that the first part (2 and a half hours!!!) felt like 5 hours. I stopped watching it right then since it drives me mad. I'd have to say, despite everyone seeming to love this, that for a modern viewer, like me, this is a tough movie to get through. Movie buffs who are into older movies will like this though.",Lawrence of Arabia

I would ask you ignore one or two people who have bemoaned the lack of a 'happy' or 'clear' ending. Sitting for 3.5 hours and missing the point completely must be frustrating. The last scene, as Lawrence is driven away, his dreams of helping to form an arab state in ruins - passing arabs on camels and with a motor bike overtaking him is a moment of regret and a hint of further doom like no other. The psycological depth of the film has few parallels and having read Seven Pillars of Wisdom it certainly reflects Lawrence's psyché well. In terms of script and cinematography there is a short analysis by Sam Yates of one scene on You Tube that brilliantly shows the genius of Lean and why almost 60 years after it was made the film is still utterly mesmeric. I am watching it again this week with my 18 year old son who is joining the military. As a guide to politics, power, individuality and regret it has no equal.",Lawrence of Arabia
426,ruxandrasilvia,"""I just want my ration of common humanity""",10,23 March 2012,"Anyone who hasn't lived under a rock has heard about this film and Peter O'Toole's legendary performance. But it's only recently that I've finally seen it. This is simply the Greatest Film ever made, a stunning work of art. What impressed me most is how SUBTLE the film is, and how personal/introspective despite its grandeur.Surprisingly, it turns out that it is possible after all to have a marvelous film about homosexuality and violence (among many other themes explored here) without characters spouting ad-nauseam words like ""fu*k"", ""fag"", ""shit"" and others like that, which are the ""hallmark"" of ""edgy"" cinema these days. Could you have imagined? I can only say, like Sheriff Ali: ""The miracle is accomplished"". No dirty talk, no gore, no obscenity, yet incredibly powerful and beautiful, a masterpiece on all accounts.Possible spoilers ahead.I was absolutely fascinated with the hero's psychology, so much that I had to watch the movie a couple of times. Those images of breath-taking magnificence and O'Toole's mesmerizing eyes lit from inside by his disconcerting turmoil never cease to amaze me. Has Lawrence ""gone native""? Does he have a Messiah complex? Is he just suicidal? It's almost as if everything he does is an attempt to affirm his (sexual) identity. But who is he? Is he masculine? Is he feminine? Is he British? Is he an Arab? Is he homosexual? Or asexual? He seems unable to find his place, not sure on how to dress and how to act, shifting from egotistic grandeur to humility and back. His narcissistic rage goes from slight irritation (""Do you think that I'm just anybody, Ali?"") to the famous ""No prisoners!"" episode. And then, there's the subtle masochistic streak throughout the movie, complicating Lawrence's contradictions even more. Never have I seen such a wonderful and subtle depiction of yearning for pain and adventure as the ""match trick"" cut to the desert sunrise. He starts his journey desperately wanting to be a desert hero, but he's acting like an enthusiastic tourist in an alien world that he's not able to fully understand (watch the sequence where going to battle, Lawrence hears for the first time the strange and haunting howling of distant Arabs).The movie has a most interesting take on free will. Lawrence's vulnerability is made clear in the opening sequence, and multiple hints on fatality-destiny are made throughout the movie, with a Schopenhauer sound: man can do what he wants, be he cannot will what he wants.The movie ends abruptly and there is no sense of conclusion, as Lawrence - used and abused, but not entirely innocent himself - is heading home. Where ""home"" is, he doesn't seem to know. The closing shot of Lawrence's face becoming indistinguishable behind the dusty windshield is incredibly frustrating, but closes the circle perfectly. I actually got closer to the TV screen, hoping to get a better look at him for an ""explanation"". A motorcycle ominously passes by, foreshadowing his sudden death... The man remains unknowable, and that is the film's maddening genius.O'Toole and Sharif have superb chemistry together. But no matter how brooding and passionate Omar Sharif is, or how delightfully over-the-top Anthony Quinn is, it's Peter O'Toole who steals the show with his beauty and intensity. His eyes reflect the desert, the vast and mysterious landscape within, because ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is above all, an exquisite exploration of the mind.",Lawrence of Arabia
427,mattloveless,"Deserves spot among its era, but best ever? I guess you had to be there.",6,15 September 2020,"I recently watched Lawrence of Arabia for the first time, as it certainly has a reputation as a classic. The film was genuinely moving and thought-provoking in parts, but altogether it's an experience akin to many movies like it: It probably watches better now if you'd already seen it decades earlier.There's an element of stage acting in many of these classics - a manner (or even volume) of conversation, dramatic, unnatural turns toward or away from an argument - that, to me, has not aged well.The pacing is slow and deliberate. There's maybe an hour of dialogue in this 3 hr, 42 minute movie, a runtime which is used mostly to explore the grandness of the scenery, though admittedly, at times, I wondered if the film was buffering when it wasn't. I don't think criticisms that it's a bit boring are unwarranted.The scale of the film, even by today's standards, is pretty outstanding. Scenes of charging camels riding to battle, the music & landscapes of the desert - all of this is as advertised. The main character? I'm not sure what we're supposed to think of T.E. Lawrence. He sort of alternated between humble solider & self-appointed deity, between altruistic and self-serving. The lack of consistency never gets us to truly understand his motives or desires, and again, like movies of old, the overacting (theatrical falls to the ground, dramatic glances, contrived shouting matches) pulled those opposing themes farther apart.Again, I feel like you just had to be there. I don't think it's unfair to suggest that Hollywood's top filmmakers have found new and innovative ways to tell great stories in the last 60 years, at least for today's audiences. If classic films aren't your cup of tea, this one may be tough to sit through.",Lawrence of Arabia

429,poofta1970,I am totally gobsmacked!,10,3 October 2004,"I am totally amazed by some of the negative responses to this film. Yes it is a long film; a very long film. Perhaps this is a symptom of the short attention spans of people today. But you know what? I wish it was 3 or 4 times longer. Every time this film finishes I compare it to the badly acted special effects laden rubbish that passes for 'epic' cinema these days and wish that T.E Lawrence had his motorcycle accident at 93 (rather than 47 as he did in 1935) so I could have had more of Peter O' Toole's electrifying performance.The cinematography is acknowledged as being some of the the best in any film ever. When Mr Lean wanted to capture a sun rise, he stood in the dark (in a REAL desert) and waited for the sun to REALLY rise (No computerized nonsense in this film). As for the reviewer who thought Lawrence looked like a homosexual because he had a 'effeminate' walk, well ... I can only hope that one day he joins the 21st century; hero's aren't all musclebound apes, leaders aren't all fluffy paragons of virtue, and so what if he did turn out to be homosexual?If you and you dad like watching a man being whipped before being violated there is, I believe, a wealth of material available to cater for your taste at your local pornography shop.In my opinion its one of the best films ever made and certainly the best film I've seen based on real events.Forget the length feel the quality.",Lawrence of Arabia
430,nisitpav,The best movie of all motion picture history,10,24 August 2005,"I first watched ""Lawrence of Arabia"" when I was about 11 years old. Being a big fan of Steven Spielberg at that time, I was sort of awed by the fact that this was his personal favorite (check the ""conversation with Steven Spielberg"" featurette in the special features disk and you'll really see Spielberg's affection for that film)Over the years, Lawrence remained among my DVD collection, and I can't say I actually watched it since that first time, when, by the way, I didn't really like it. But ""time does things to movies"", and when I watched it again last year, I found my eyes to be weeping at the end. It instantly became one of my favorite movies.Since then I learned a lot about the history of cinema, and I also learned a great deal about the movies of Sir David Lean. I found my self watching films like ""Brief Encounter"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Ryan's Daughter"", and the underrated, ""A passage to India"". Lean became one of my favorite directors, and, just a few months ago, I decided to watch Lawrence with some friends. Although I had seen it a couple of times before, this time it was a different experience altogether: from the starting credits, to the blowing of the match, the crossing of the Nefud dessert, finding Gassim and bringing him back to the camp, the invasion of Aqaba, his torture and rape (?), Lawrence's laugh after the slap by the ""outrageaous"" guy, his being left alone, to the final gaze to the motorcycle. I sensed something when I watched that film, which leaves my with the undoubted feeling that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is the greatest film ever made. For me, this is it. Ever since '62, it's been a downfall. No other film has managed to reach Lawrence in its poetic greatness. Few do come very close (Vertigo for instance).If we are to classify the two complete different cinematic styles, it would be those of Hitchcock and Ford. Hitch was a very ""confined"" director. He captured his movies from the point of view of one character. His movies took place, most of the time, in closed spaces. In a sense, Hitchcock's films were a journey in people's emotions and a study in people's characters. On the other hand, Ford was an open director. He wasn't confined to one character, or one location, his films where actual journeys. His basis was mostly on theme, and his main ability was to amaze with his imagery. Thus, these are the two different shooting styles....Well, Lean combines both.Which is basically why his best film, Lawrence, is the best film of all times. But not only in terms of style. Also, in terms of content. The intelligent script written by Robert Bolt, the powerhouse performances by O'Toole and Shariff (a shame they didn't get the statuette), but also, the ultimately heroic yet tragic figure of T.E. Lawrence, contribute in making this the most visually and emotionally sweeping film of the last 111 years.Such a shame that Lean retired for 14 years after ""Ryan's Daughter"", there's no way to know where he would have gotten.",Lawrence of Arabia

The characters are believable, and likeable, and played by incredibly gifted actors. The scenery is superb, easily replacing ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as my favorite ""desert"" movie. But most of all we aren't told what to think about T.E. Lawrence. After watching the film, I still don't know if he was a genius or a madman, a hero or a hack. It is 220 minutes long, but even though I had other, more urgent things to do, I could stop the film, I had to watch it in one sitting. The only thing that annoyed me was the poor quality of the film on DVD at times. It looks like the film they used for the transfer was in bad shape, as if it had been exposed too much to the sun.

It re-affirmed my belief that this is probably the finest film ever made. Previously to now having to put up with murky VHS prints I could never appreciate Freddie Young's photography, the level of detail is outstanding and the colour a wonder to behold. The size of the image allows you to see the real skill of the cast, as subtle expressions and movements are so easily lost on the Television screen.Although it rather dramatises the events that took place in Arabia during the Great War, the condensing (and inevitable intensifying) of events was essential in order to bring T.E. Lawrence's 700 page tome The Seven Pillars Of Wisdom to screen. Although approaching 4 hours in length is not a moment too long.

Revisiting it many times over the years, I have come to appreciate its finesse more and more, and rare it as one of my favourite films alongside The Shawshank Redemption, The Deer Hunter, 2001; A Space Odyssey and Breakfast at Tiffany's. The attention to even the minutest detail is stunning, as if a Michelin-starred chef had built the most exquisite dish whilst adding the tiniest of infusions to layer the taste. The scope of the film demands the viewer to sit back in a comfy chair, with a glass of Pimms and lemonade, and watch the spectacle in its original format; to view on anything other than letterbox view loses some of the detail that, whilst almost un-noticeable, is essential. Like a great painter, Lean laid down exquisite layers of images that make the film almost second to none in this department Iconic images abound, and ones eyes are treated to a visual feast, not only during the action sequences but also in the quieter, more reflective moments.

Maybe it was my age, but Lawrence of Arabia had a profound effect on me. I had never seen anything matching the visual images in Lawrence.  It has led to a life long hobby of collecting movie stills and posters with a large number of items from Lawrence of Arabia.  I have every version put out on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD.

443,awesomesteinberg,A Breathtaking Masterpiece,10,6 August 2014,"As many good things as I had heard about this movie, I will admit I was cautious when I recently watched it. To quote Omar Sharif, one of the stars of the film, ""If you are the man with the money and somebody comes to you and says he wants to make a film that's four hours long, with no stars, and no women, and no love story, and not much action either, and he wants to spend a huge amount of money to go film it in the desert--what would you say?"" Chances are, most people wouldn't want to watch that kind of movie. And despite that, after my first viewing, there is no doubt about it- ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a piece of cinematic perfection.This 1962 classic, directed by David Lean, tells the true story of T.E. Lawrence, a British military officer who unites Arabian desert tribes during World War I to overthrow the Turkish Empire. What ensues is a piece of film so good, it will take your breath away.This movie works on so many levels, but the most obvious, and greatest, is Peter O'Toole's performance as the title character. He is so complex, so subtle and yet so lively, that you can't take your eyes off the screen. It is his performance that makes this film what it is. If I made a list of the Top 10 Best Performances in Film, (Which would be impossible to rank) O'Toole would undoubtedly be on there, along with Brando in ""The Godfather,"" Welles in ""Citizen Kane,"" Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and Monroe in ""Some Like It Hot."" Without him, this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as good as it is, and it is hard not to be amazed, or full of fright, at how his character changes throughout the movie.Of course, that is not to say that the rest of the cast is bad, far from it. Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal and Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali are the standouts of the supporting cast, and Anthonys Quinn and Quayle are just as good.Every single technical aspect of this movie is done to perfection. The cinematography is among the best in any movie, as it brilliantly captures the beauty and size of the desert. I have not had a chance to see this in a theater, but I would gladly see it again on the biggest screen possible. The cut from the match to the sunrise is just amazing, rivaled only by the bone cut in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The battle scenes, although they are not a major part of the movie, are wonderfully put together. The score is fantastic, I could listen to the main theme for hours. And, even with a running time of almost 4 hours, every scene feels essential, even if it isn't directly important to the plot. My only complaint is that it occasionally feels slow, but the other moments are so amazing that it hardly matters.Often I will not agree with the Academy Awards, but this is one rare instance where I feel that they actually got it right. (Although that may be just that it was so good that they knew people would kill them if it didn't win) It deserved every single award it got, (And the ones it didn't, why didn't Peter O'Toole get Best Actor? Why?) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" may even be my pick for #2 Best Film of All Time. (""The Godfather"" is #1.) So, of course, it gets 10/10.

444,bwilson-308,"A very great film, excellent as both a character study and in historical insights",10,5 June 2006,"There have been some intelligent comments made on this - and the most I can do is to show why this is my favourite film. Not having been born when it was made, I have only once had the privilege of seeing it on the big screen - when the restored version went on limited release around the country.As a boy, I undoubtedly appreciated it on the level I appreciated other films about adventure and war. As I have watched it again, I have appreciated and marvelled at the film-making techniques and tricks others have drawn attention to - for example, the lighting of a match in an office leading into action in the desert heat.However, it is now as a character and historical study I most appreciate it. Reviewers have sometimes complained that the film really helps us understand nothing about Lawrence's motivations and that the desert atmosphere and action are what is paramount. However, that is precisely the point - the T.E. Lawrence of the film does not understand himself. After his early victories and his working of the 'miracle' he was told was needed he sees himself as a prophet, someone for whom 'nothing is written', someone like Moses who is 'beloved of God'. His insecurity about his identity is, however, reflected in his conversation with Ali about being born out of wedlock. And towards the end of the film, after his torture and also after his discussions with Allenby, he has changed from someone for whom mercy is 'a passion' into someone guilty of a massacre of Turks and then contemptuous of the responsibility to care medically for Turkish prisoners. He has assumed some of the barbarism the British, French and Americans have accused the Arabs of - and yet there have been his statements about how his white skin have meant Arab robes could not hide the fact he was not a true Arab! He is indeed a man who does not understand himself - who cannot settle comfortably into the role of either prophetic uniter and deliverer of the Arabs or else the ordinary soldier he sometimes aspires to be.In terms of history, I find the film interesting in reflecting the divisions between different Arab peoples. Although no expert on Middle East affairs, I wonder if that is a lesson Westerners have failed to learn about the Arab world. And I am also intrigued by the light it casts on colonial interests during World War One - on how, for example, Lawrence was also at the mercy of the politicians. And again, I suspect those are factors whose bearing remains to this day.",Lawrence of Arabia

One day, while I was on the internet, I came across information about the film. I've learned that it won best picture in 1962; I've learned about how it influenced filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg; and I learned about how it adapted the memoirs of T.E. Lawrence and made them into a feature length film. This interested me so much that I decided to head down to blockbuster and rent it. Now that I've watched it, what do I think of it? Well, to be honest, I thought it was just plain out boring. The problem I had with this movie is that not once I cared about Lawrence or his conflict. I did not see any depth in his character and I did not for once care for what he was fighting for. To me, this felt more like a boring history lecture than an actual film. There is a plot in this movie, but it doesn't really surface in an interesting way and the viewing of this film just becomes tedious.I do admit that this film was very well made, but it's only icing covering a bland, tasteless cake. There are some good scenes in this film, but why couldn't the filmmakers make Lawrence or his conflict more interesting. At least in Seven Samurai, the conflict was simple enough and the characters were well developed to keep me interested, but Lawrence doesn't have that.I can't recommend the film, but I know other film buffs will want to see it.

446,lotsofwordz,"The most over-hyped, overrated film of its generation",1,2 January 2007,"This is the film where David Lean's megalomania and pretentiousness, already evident in The Bridge on the River Kwai (a film that is just this side of bearable), spilled over into an overweening arrogance and smugness, and an unjustified belief that he can do no wrong, however absurd the casting, the story and the photography. Lean knew nothing of the Middle East and understood less. The film presents a completely false picture of it: glossy, saccharine and indeed patronising (and thus, borderline racist). The historical context is tendentious, biased and false: the centuries-old story of the Jews rebuilding their own country is barely given a supercilious nod. However great an actor Alec Guiness is, casting him as Feisal is just plain silly. Were there no actors of Middle Eastern background and appearance? He looks like an uncomfortable transplant from the East End of Charles Dickens, an Irish or Scottish princeling who took the wrong train at Holborn underground station. The notion that 'this is the best British film of all time' is as absurd as the film itself: glitziness does not equal quality. Even Lean made better films by far (for example, Great Expectations), and The Third Man is miles better, too. These films are cinematic: they understand the medium and utilise it properly. Lawrence tries to get by on sheer bombast, and fails miserably as it must.",Lawrence of Arabia
447,ZEKE-18,The Epic Cinema at age 10,10,20 March 1999,"My first large screen experience was Lawrence of Arabia.  At the age of 10 in the largest cinema in Detroit I sat in awe as the opening motorcycle scene left this young man dead.  This I could understand and relate to. The desert, the Arab culture and the prejudice of the English I could understand.  The politics eluded me, but the majesty and the splendor of the presentation had me hooked!  Many more cinematic escapades I pursued: when they re-vitalized (restoral it wasn't) Gone with the Wind and brought it out in 70mm for the first time, the first cinerama I saw was How the West was Won and then 2001.  But when they restored Lawrence, I went back and I understood it all.  The same goosebumps and cinema thrills of a 10 year old with the experience of adulthood brought the struggle and the commitment of Lawrence and his Arab bretheren to the forefront.  This was a documentary, perhaps innaccurate, but It in essence is a true story of an English gentleman giving up a life of luxury to free ""his"" people.  The dramatic license is used judiciously, with flair, and in the seductive setting that helped form the man, so be it.  In all the purpose of film is to escape and find yourself involved and intrigued.  Enjoyment is the name of the film game.  With the memories of childhood and the wisdom of age, the Lawrence epic is one of the greatest movies on record, worthy of a top ten.  I own many a disc, in Laser and now DVD, my first purchase was Lawrence.",Lawrence of Arabia
448,HAL-74,Simply Outstanding!,10,9 May 1999,"Lawrence Of Arabia is a remarkable film and paves the way for other adventure epics to come. About a man's struggle with identity, heroism, murder, and even homosexuality(the real Lawrence was a homosexual).  David Lean does a great job presenting this epic.  There are some of the finest scenes shot in the desert in this movie.  For example, the intense scene when it shows the sun then Lawrence then the other man in rotations. This movie is extremely exciting and you are always hanging on the edge of your seat to see what happens next.  It is amazing in the theater( I was lucky enough to catch it while in theaters for two days).  Lawrence has brilliant cinematography, great directing, amazing acting, and an extraordinary screenplay.  The way it shows Lawrence changing and becoming insane is remarkable. This really makes you think about how dreadful killing a man must be.  Lawrence is a great movie in every aspect and a must see for any fan of the genre.",Lawrence of Arabia

Lawrence of Arabia is one of his sweeping masterpieces. Great performances by Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and Sir Alec Guinness. Quite possibly the most amazing film to look at. Robert Bolt's screenplay captures much of the essence of T. E. Lawrence, along with historical accuracy and dramatic effect. Along with Citizen Kane and Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, this is one of three pictures that best represent excellence in every aspect of filmmaking: visually, contextually, and in the performances.",Lawrence of Arabia
450,J-ion,One of the 10 best films ever made...,10,17 January 2001,"I have watched ""Lawrence of Arabia"" more that 10 times in the last 2 years, and each time seems to be a new experience of true art. A film almost 40 years old, which hasn't lost a trace of its initial vigor and beauty. A hymn to a time, where no computer wizards or elaborated FX could 'cover' acting or directing deficiencies. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a film where the natural, wild beauty of the desert, provides the perfect set for the unfolding of T.E. Lawrence's adventures. The splendid photography, both beautiful and meaningful, revealed the life and soul of the landscape, while the unmatched music score gave the blood for the heart of the film. The actors. Peter O' Toole, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and the rest of the cast, directed superbly by David Lean, gave one of the best performances of their rich careers. Maybe the best. Each sentiment, each feeling expressed in the film, is so vivid, so genuine, that creates the impression that you're watching NOT just a film, but the real thing! The real adventure!I would rate many films with a '9'. But with a '10', very few. And ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is rightfully on of them. Certainly, one of the 10 best films ever made.",Lawrence of Arabia
451,lee-214,The greatest *some spoilers*,10,10 May 2003,"Clocking in at a little over the 4 hour mark(in the remastered director's cut), David Lean's finest film chronicles the experiences of T.E. Lawrence(Peter O' Toole) on the Arab front during WWI. After a short prologue depicting Lawrence's premature death and funeral. We are cast back in time(more than 20 years) to Cairo, where Lawrence is about to begin the greatest adventure of his career: his commanding officer instructs him to liaise with Prince Feisel(Alec Guiness) of the Bedou people, in a bid to make an 'appraisal' of the fortunes of the Arab forces in the struggle against the Ottoman Turks. A concise summary of the movie would outline five key events: i)Lawrence's journey into Bedouin territory and his meetings with Feisel and Sherif Ali Ibn El Kharish (Omar Sharif) - Omar Sharif's entrance alone has become legend in the annals of movie history ii)The ardous trek across the Nefud Desert and subsequent attack on Aqaba iii)Lawrence's torture at the hands of the sadistic Turkish Bey in Deraa iv)The massacre at Tafas. v)The final success in Damascus.Robert Bolt's screenplay stretches beyond the typical fare of historical blockbusters by offering a graphic portrayal of Lawrence's character rather than depicting the combat in detail. When we first meet Lawrence, he is 'out of place' among his peers in the army - even his uniform is ill-fitting - a desire for greatness burns within him(`I cannot fiddle but I can make a great state out of a little city') and the opportunity to leave for Arabia is welcome relief from the tedium of cartography. His encounter with Ali(Omar Sharif) and the friendship that follows is crucial to the movie in that it offers a foil to the viewers against which they should draw contrasts to gain an understanding of Lawrence's psyche. Ali and his people accept Lawrence as one of their own, effectively adopting him as their leader - he wears Arabian clothes, eats their food etc. It would appear that this 'rebirth in the desert' appears to be Lawrence's true calling......until.... his capture in Deraa where his brutal treatment and degradation, causes him to becomes a sadistic, doubtful man with an insatiabe desire for revenge. Following the capture of Damascus, Lawrence beceomes redundant and leaves for England while the politicial resolution continues.`I never knew him well you know...', the words of General Allenby,Lawrence's commanding officer, at the movies opening. By the end of the picture, one wonders whetther they have gained any insight into this remarkable character.....do we really know him? Did he even know himself? Lawrence of Arabia is, above all else, a movie concerned with identity. Lawrence was a man who never truly 'found himself'. Detached from his compatriots-he labelled them as a `fat people' and followed with the line `I'm different'. He never really found peace among the Arabs either, brief happiness perhaps, but not peace. His happiness largly resulted from delusions of grandeur that were rooted in the godlike-status in which the Arabs held him. Indeed it was a mild hypocrisy that a man who believed that he was 'destined' for greatness would boldly declare that `Nothing is written!' before attempting the impossible(there is an ambiguity in this wonderful line which hints at an underlying scorn for the beliefs of the Arab people). Lawrence deterioration following his torture is well-contrasted against the reformed Ali(who initially appeared as a savage). Ali would now like to `learn politics' andis disgusted at Lawrence's bloodlust(`You speak to me of bloodshed?!'), while Lawrence `enjoyed' his execution of Gazim and no longer believes in taking prisoners in battle. Indeed Lean's illustration of the dark side of both men as well as such scenes as the one in which a mob scramble for a pistol would indicate that Lean believes that evil is an inherent part of man's nature. Another aspect of his character which was mildly referenced(and understandably so) was the possibility that he may have been homosexual. The total absence of female characters, his relationship with the young male servants and camp exhibitionism offer the audience slight hints regarding this. Obviously it would have been impossible to directly address this in a movie of this nature - it was an era when homosexuality sneered upon and creating an overtly gay hero would have been commercial suicide. But again this reinforces Lawrence's inability to define himself. As a final note there is one scene in which a motorcyclist shouts `WHO ARE YOU?' across the Suez canal with Lawrence standing in shot....the voice is that of David Lean.As a spectacle few movies rival Lawrence of Arabia, special effects are non-existent because the set-pieces were performed for real....trains were derailed...hordes of camel riders stormed across the sand(which was kept immaculate on a minimum of takes) etc. Shot in cinemascope with a predominantly left to right camera movement the viewers get a genuine sense of a cinematic journey, added to this is Maurice Jarre's sweeping score inspires awe in the viewer for the vast desert landscapes. The glorious cinematography and spectacular set-pieces enrapture rather than overwhelm the characters on screen. And what characters they are....aside from O'Toole(whose performance is one of the greatest of all time) and Sharif, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quayle and the ever wonderful Claude Rains complete an astonishing leading cast. I could talk about this forever so I should probably shut up.Lawrence of Arabia could not be made again, a studio would not allow a blockbuster to be released without a female lead, the effects would be digitised to cut down on cost, it's running time would be butchered, an newcomer like O'Toole would probably not obtain the lead etc. etc. Shame really.",Lawrence of Arabia
452,heverett-10426,Epic of all Epics,10,3 August 2020,"Lawrence of Arabia was directed by David Lean and stars Peter O' Toole, Omar Sharif and Anthony Guiness. It is rightly regarded as a masterpiece of the epic genre. The direction and cinematography emphasize the vastness and beauty of the desert. Characters are often depicted as tiny specks on the screen to give the impression of a never-ending landscape. This movie does not have a complex plot and is not dialogue-heavy. The epic score, the beautiful landscapes and the excellent performances are what makes this movie great. O' Toole is especially good as the larger-than-life T.E. Lawrence. The result is an amazing movie with great psychological complexity.",Lawrence of Arabia
453,salfamily,An Epic Both Astounding and Subtle,10,4 August 2001,"David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is often referred to as an epic, a term usually reserved for grand and sweeping works, painted in broad strokes, in which the more subtle nuances of character and motivation are swept aside in favor of sheer sensuality. And, to an extent, Lawrence fits this bill-- few films can match it in the department of grandness. Yet the film is anything but simplistic in its approach to its characters and the themes they represent. Indeed, Peter O'Toole's Lawrence is surely one of the more complex and perplexing heroes to ever grace a movie screen. Just who is this man? What does he stand for and what makes him great? For that matter, can he really be called great at all?Viewers may be persuaded by this lack of resolution inherent in O'Toole's Lawrence to criticize the film on the grounds that it fails to adequately tell us about the person it purports to portray, the British officer of the first world war, T.E Lawrence. But they would, I think, overlook one of the most noteworthy aspects of the film. For Lean never claims to really know who this man was; he never saddles his protagonist with a pat identity or set of values from which we might glean an opinion as to his intentions.
From the outset of the movie, in which we are shown Lawrence's funeral, we are told that the subject of this film is a man about whom little can be readily agreed upon. Several men at the funeral praise Lawrence; they call him a ""great man,"" reciting phrases that sound as though they were memorized out of history books. Others are not so kind; they refer instead to his oddness and penchant for self-promotion. Still others admit to ambivalence; they never really knew Lawrence, they confess, even though they spent considerable amounts of time with him during the war.Lean proceeds throughout the rest of the film to show us the character of Lawrence from many contradictory angles. He is both Arab and Englishman, idealist and fatalist, messiah and murderer. Lawrence, the film suggests, was a man who was defined by his lack of resolution. What's more, Lawrence himself recognized this; indeed, his struggle with his own duality was central to his very being. At the end of it all we the audience are in no better position from which to judge Lawrence than were the funeral-goers from the film's beginning. That Lawrence accomplished great things cannot be denied. But the man remains a mystery.Of course, Lawrence of Arabia doesn't just examine the character of T.E. Lawrence; it also demonstrates how he affected (or failed to affect) the tribal Arab factions he attempted to unite. In doing so it asks us, What is the nature of a great man? How does he inspire himself and those around him, and to what end? Can one simply will a miracle, and if he does, will it be enough to support a revolution? Those who watch this movie will see that Lawrence did indeed will a miracle. But the end result of his efforts was perhaps not what he had originally hoped for.No discussion of Lawrence of Arabia should be without a mention of Lean's artistry as a director; the film is overflowing with extraordinary images and larger than life action. Utilizing many long shots of tiny, ant-like figures transversing great stretches of sand, Lean makes us feel the vast, brutal power of the desert in a way that no other filmmaker ever has. Additionally, the score is memorable and epic enough to match its visual accompaniment, and the performances by the cast are for the most part outstanding. O'Toole in particular turns in one of the more unique performances in movie history, and every single word uttered by Alec Guinness' Prince Faisal is positively captivating.If you can't tell, I admire this film a great deal, both for its qualities as an ""epic"" and its ability to somehow encapsulate a man who was perhaps beyond easy definition.",Lawrence of Arabia
454,ais_film_reviews,Breath Taking!,9,15 October 2006,"Lawrence of Arabia is a biographical film, directed by David Lean, of T.E. Lawrence, taken from the autobiography ""The Seven Pillars of Wisdom."" T.E. Lawrence is a British lieutenant who is stationed in Arabia. He was sent into the deserts to report about the conflicts in Arabia concerning national movements from 1916-1918, but Lawrence comes back loving the Arabs, and decides to help them fight for their freedom against the Ottoman Empire.I thought this film to be absolutely magnificent, especially in respect to the breathtaking scenery captured. Lawrence of Arabia is made in the deserts of Morocco and Jordan. The scenery is very big, most of the time the characters in the shot are tiny in comparison to the large mountains, canyons, desert sands, and etcetera. The view is great, and makes you want to jump into your TV screen.The soundtrack is also brilliant, composed by Maurice Jarre. He uses orchestra filled with very bold sounds, a lot of the time glorifying the Arabs and their victories. It really fits the mood with the film, however a lot of times the soundtrack is overwhelming, and I had to turn down the volume at certain moments. There are also a few scenes in which silence is used, in moments of uncertainty and nervousness. This technique was used very well and we really get a sense of the anxiety that is felt by the characters.The cinematography and editing was also very creative and unique. A lot of times the camera uses shots to jump further into time. For example, the dust in the desert fills the screen, and once it is blown away, we are taken to an event further in the story. There aren't many close-up shots, but the shots that are close-up are on faces, which are full of expression.The performances of the characters were captivating. Peter O'Toole, Lawrence, was actually a new actor, but his performance does not show it. His facial expressions are amazing, and very down to earth. Through his expressions and body movement, we get a feeling for his glory filled personality, as well as his confusion about who he is, and what he wants. The performance of Omar Sharif was brilliant. He portrays his character with much enthusiasm, and we really get to know his character. One scene in particular was his encounter with Lawrence for the first time. We really get a sense of his motivation to protect his well and his lands by foreigners and other tribes. However, once he is a best friend of Lawrence's, we are able to see his loyalty and bravery towards those he loves. All of the characters were very down to earth, and in a way, easy to connect to, in a sense that they seemed real.Lawrence of Arabia was pretty much a glorious movie, and should be seen by everyone. I have been studying movies, and have watched a few of David Leans films, and I believe this is one of his best. It has a lot of different aspects that could intrigue all movie lovers. It joins adventure, drama, and war all into one to try and get to know this T.E. Lawrence who is struggling with loyalty to his country and his love for a people. In my opinion, this movie should be rated at a 9.0, and I would recommend this to everyone; it is a ""must see"".",Lawrence of Arabia
455,Stalina,Intimacy behind grandness,10,13 March 2002,"What I mainly love from David Lean is his portrayal of the emotional intimacy of his characters (be it main or secondary), for which was mainly rewarded in lower-budgeted films like Summer Madness or Brief Encounter but mainly in huge projects like Doctor Zhivago or this one.Some people keep complaining of the biographical inaccuracy here and there but they seem to miss the point that this is a film about an individual, the name is actually unimportant: what we should analyse is his emotional relationship with the desert, with the Arab men around him (including permanent homosexual overtones), with his leadership status, the British authorities, the Arab ones, etc etc. This is NOT a historic film or a biopic, it explores the rise and decline of a man's faith, integrity and enthusiasm, his evil as well as his heroism, to sum up HIS MIND and HIS FEELINGS, from piety and innocence to madness and violence and on to apathy and skepticism. This also applies to all the characters that surround him, all of them superbly characterised, none of them gratuitious or one-dimensional.The cinematography, as usual in Lean's work, stands out at every stage: wonderful photography, marvellous acting (Omar Sharif was only this great when directed by Lean, and what to say of Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness and especially Peter O'Toole?) and great narration (it is this long and yet you're never bored).

Without the orchestrators, you have little of the score's impact. Imagine hearing the soaring tunes being played on a piano! And it must be said that providing a score for such a long film is a daunting task (as some of the recent collaborators in film scores have attested). However, I must declare that hearing the sprawling main theme becomes ad nausium as the film progresses, and takes away from the theme's impact and use. One only need refer to the innovative use - and the all important RESTRAINT - of musical motives by Richard Wagner to begin to understand the potency of themes in any theatrical event.",Lawrence of Arabia

459,jdm2030,Epic masterpiece of a man struggling with his identity,10,2 May 2006,"The movie begins with the overture playing over a black screen. In reality, it is an important start to the movie- we are faced with a wavy, dreamy piece full of different undertones that relate specifically to the main character of Lawrence, alluding to the different forces in his mind and allowing the viewer to imagine, if not dream, of expectations of things to come. We have a man who grapples with his identity: he has a deep interest in the desert and in the beginning tries hard to fit in with a culture and peoples he feels are his own. He has an illusion of what he would like to be, an idea already mapped out in his mind, of what the arab peoples are, and how he, too, can hopefully become one, assimilate himself where he feels at home. The rigid constructs, however, of this illusion begin to fall apart as he fails to understand or admit to certain aspects of the culture he cannot deal or cope with: constant violence, the ever-present idea of death, and the lack of the peoples to come together and progress as a nation. He slowly begins to change, as little by little he becomes frustrated with the way things are, a way completely different than what he would like to be, a way that in the end lead him to take a pessimistic view on life, a hateful anger that he turns to the world because things have failed to go the way he chooses. The open desert, the beautiful landscapes, are all the setting for the freedom to do what one dreams to do- so long as he believes he can do it. But as he soon learns, there are things that he cannot change, and his character, his own sense of self, deteriorates.He wishes at one point in the movie to be ""ordinary"". This comes about from his inability to cope with not being able to have things the way he wants them to. Ordinary people are happy because they accept the way things are, they are subservient to tradition. Lawrence is a man who believes nothing is written- he believes a man can do anything so long as he puts his mind to the task. The movie is a constant struggle between realizing things are not always as one would like them to be, his innermost desire to be something that doesn't exist- his idea of an ""arab"", is only an illusion he has created. He is an Englishman, who had wanted to be what he thought of in his mind of a man of the desert, and learns the hard way that it is not all beautiful camel rides and the people do not have the same ideas for progress as he does. After realizing he is an alien in what he felt was his home, he begins to undergo serious repercussions and isolates himself from the world, from his friends, and most importantly from himself. He treads on with the conviction that maybe things will change, but realizes every time that they will not, it is beyond his control, so he must leave.Everyone has an idea of what they would like themselves to be, or an idea of how they imagine things to turn out, but as always, one can only write his own terms so far- we must yield to forces beyond our control. Amazing film. Amazing cinematography. Amazing acting. Amazing character developments. Watch it in one sitting, on a large screen.",Lawrence of Arabia

Strange to think that this film was made more than 40 years ago and yet it still towers over a lot of much more technologically advanced films that have come out in the last 5-6 years since 'The Matrix' supposedly raised the bar on film making.In some ways LoA has lots in common with modern epics like Lord of the Rings (particularly the first half with the long journey to Aqaba), but when you consider that everything in LoA was filmed 'live' so to speak (well apart from the shoot of the sun in the desert, but that was because the real sun kept burning the celluloid film in the camera) then you begin to appreciate the mastery that went into making this film, which must count as David Lean's masterpiece imho.In todays world, where we've seen developments like Weta Digital's Massive software(for creating huge CG armies), John Gaeta's Bullet Time, or Sky Captain with its CG Sir Laurence Olivier avatar, etc. the idea that Lean went into the desert to shoot the mirage scene 'as is' or the charge into Aqaba with real horses and riders, etc is just amazing. (You also get a similar sense of this old school film making in Sergio Leone's 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' when you hear how Eli Wallach was very nearly decapitated while filming one scene near a railway line.)Easily scores 10 out of 10 just for the sheer audacity of the film-making process.",Lawrence of Arabia

From O'Toole, Sharif, Guinness to even the lowliest servant, this is a movie where the acting is lean and on point. O'Toole's Lawrence is astonishing. Boyish, idealistic and in the end, on the verge of cracking, he brings a full character to the screen. The one thing about O'Toole that you see in this picture that follows him through ""Lord Jim,"" ""The Ruling Class"" and ""Becket"" is that he is fearless. In all of his roles, he brings forth both the admirable and the less pleasant aspects of a character's emotional life.

472,whiteknight_copley,Brilliant touches,10,10 April 2016,"As well as the epic sweep of this movie, there are the enduring moments, images and transitions that remain in the memory and raise this film to the level of greatness. I mention just four that sear this film onto my consciousness: the extinguishing of the smouldering match followed by the rising desert sun (a brilliant metaphor for Lawrence, a smouldering wick caught up in his own hell fire will he be snuffed out?), the ringing of the alarm bell at Aquaba, a superimposed sound transition to the attack scene, as the camera closes in on Lawrence's agonised features following the execution that he had to carry out before the attack and to make sure it happened (again an amazing metaphor as the bell rings out like it is announcing coming doom for Lawrence as he has much more blood to spill in the coming days) And then the ship that suddenly appears on the Suez canal but as if it is sailing across the desert (a nod to the idea of camels perhaps, I don't understand if it is meant to be a metaphor but it is simply a magnificent image). Then, at the very end there is the juxtaposition of the Arab camel riders and the truck-borne Tommies singing their contrasting songs: different songs, different technologies, contrasting, conflicting cultures with Lawrence exiting history still not knowing to which culture his allegiance lies - as the driver comforts him with the thought that he is going ""home"" But is he really going home?The pivotal moment of the film follows shortly after the Ship image, when a motorcyclist appears on the far bank of the canal and cries out ""Who are you?"" and the camera closes up on Lawrence's exhausted, wondering face. This is the question that encapsulates the whole film, who exactly is Lawrence? and it is reprised at various points: The scene outside St Paul's, Faisal's question ""is he a desert loving Englishman?"", the MOs failure to see Lawrence is not a ""filthy"" Arab, The journalists treatment of him, Lawrence dressing like an Arab prince, Preston calling him a brilliant soldier etc etc etc, All the way through, it is a brilliant, intelligent screenplay. The motorcyclist was actually David Lean, putting his own signature on a magnificent canvas....There is one segment that encapsulates the touch of David Lean's direction of actors, the scene with Jose Ferrer as the Turkish Bey. Ferrer described his small part as the best acting he'd ever done while O'Toole said he learned more from Ferrer in that scene than all his years at drama school. But watch the acting of the uncredited extras, soldiers and flotsam from Deraa. With no dialogue they capture the degradation, hopelessness, (in the case of the townsmen) and the callousness and resignation (in the case of the soldiers) of the ""cattle"" who surround the Bey magnificently. Who are these unsung heroes? Two are jobbing Spanish actors but the rest are also excellent, especially the man third in line with the fez and the young soldier. They are brilliant and add so much to the intensity of this scene...",Lawrence of Arabia
473,matthewjschelle,The Legacy Of An Epic,10,27 December 2001,"After adapting a novel called The Bridge On The River Kwai and adding a Hollywood feel to it through the controls of Sam Spiegel, master film craftsman David Lean set out on another search for his next grand feat of cinema making. After garnishing 7 oscars, Lean thirsted for a new challenge. He found it in the book called, 'The Seven Pillars Of Wisdom', by Major T.E.Lawrence. An autobiographical account of his time in World War I under the command of Prince Faisal and his campaigns against the turk, the legend of Lawrence could have made for more than 20 hours of filmmaking.
Rounding up an all star cast including Academy Award Winner Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, the remarkable Omar Shariff, was a debuting actor named Peter O'Toole. Lean was wise to choose a so-called 'beginner'. For no actor of the time could play Lawrence without letting it go to their heads. But Peter O'Toole personified Lawrence to a staggering point of clarity. On film, he IS Lawrence.David Lean has the power in his films to envoke a sense of grandeur in natural landscapes, and how the environment reflects the characters. One only needs to go so far as to watch A Passage To India, Doctor Zhivago, In Which We Serve or The Bridge On The River Kwai to see such an effect.In the scene where the Arab party cross the Sun's Anvil in the mighty Nefu desert, the sweat builds up on the audience's skin. And when they finally storm Aqaba, the adrenalin builds in a panning long shot, as the Arabs sweep towards the seaside like a rollicking wave.Robert Bolt's debut screenplay is the best debut screenplay ever. The intensity of his characters on paper is staggering. Auda abu Tayi's dialogue can send shivers down anyone's spine.Made for the last generation who preferred different films than those of today's (with Titanic, Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring and Gladiator slight exceptions) and with a running length close to four hours, Lawrence Of Arabia remains one of the greatest films ever made and in my opinion, the best.Lawrence of Arabia is the story of a man changed in the desert, and in watching it, so too are we changed.",Lawrence of Arabia

Superb actors , dialogue , musical score and plot but the main star just has to be the panoramic images captured with skilful camera work and of course made long before CGI .As an aside in the 1960's I took the opportunity to visit Lawrence's cottage near Bovington and remember it as being quite small , spartan and the key feature in what must have been his main room a huge leather day bed on which he would recline .",Lawrence of Arabia

The imagery is simply amazing, so is the acting, and the story. simply splendid. Only thing that I would have to say against it is that it's slow, but the images make that an unimportant matter, now at least you can actually see the whole beauty of it.Only bad thing of the movie really, NO women. Yea some dead ones, in a village... Really, 3 hours, no women.Summary: (CONTAINS SPOILERS, well not really, but i guess to be on the safe side) The story is about an (extra)ordinary British soldier in the (I assumed) first world war, not in england, in Cairo, from there he was sent to help prince Feisal of the Arabs. He ends up with conquering Damascus and fighting for the Arabs, or the British? I'm sorry, i really can't say much without spoiling your movie :(All I can say is, when watching this movie, first of all pay good attention to the cinematographics, then, ask yourself, what's his motive (what's everyones motive for that matter), what moves him and what does he think.If you stay in that question-asking-mood, i doubt you will find this movie boring (slow....) and i think you'll very much like to spend your 3 hours on this!genre: tale music: 7/10 (old) suspense: 6/10 (old, slow) story: 9/10 cinematography: 10/10 acting: 10/10overall: 9/10",Lawrence of Arabia

Lawrence is a film of such unimaginable beauty, that one really has to see it several times before they can fully appreciate it. The first time will be simply too much and only after a while will they begin to realize just what a great film it its. Suddenly every other film just pales into insignificanceSpielberg cites it as one of his favourite films of all time, and you can easily see why. The life of TE Lawrence is bought to us in such a mind blowingly spectacular way that at first viewing, the modern viewer ~( post star wars ) might think "" humph, i've seen all this before"" and to be honest ,they have a point.But this is where it all began, all those epic scenes that are the bread and butter of modern FX ~Blockbusrters, owe almost everything to this movie. There are scenes in this movie that wouldn't look out of place in Lord of the Rings.This is before we even get to the wonderful performances of its principle cast. the sweeping score and the never equaled cinematographyLawrence of Arabia is the greatest piece of cinema ever.

It is a rare thing that a movie with running time of over 3 hours keeps you captivated all the way through it. I kept guessing and missgeussing what would happen next. The movie is wonderfully paced - Keeping the audience engrossed and intrigued all the way through it. The other thing to point out is that despite being a war, adventure and biography movie - there is never too much of action or too much of fighting - the movie is perfectly blanced. The last bit mot the least is that the desert scenes, the awesome actors make the movie beautiful and pleasant to watch - a rare occurence with the war movies.

I know epic films aren't for everyone, but I keep returning to this one time and again. The way the film is shot and edited is breathtaking. The acting is top notch and played to the hilt. What I find most fascinating about this film is the metamorphosis of T.E. Lawrence in the process. He's a man who rises to become a legend who is then repeatedly reminded that he is just a man. How does one face this? It's an interesting journey (and worth watching 100 times!).",Lawrence of Arabia

Liked it (sort of-enjoyed the battle scenes and the train blowing up), but didn't understand why my dad was so crazy about it.The next time was on laserdisc (remember those?) almost 10 years ago and I was hooked. I finally got it - the conflict, the performances, the music, the dialogue - all mesmerising.But it was only in 2002, when I saw the 40th-anniversary reissue on 70mm that I was completely blown away seeing the scale, the enormity of Lean's accomplishment. There were scenes that gave me goosepimples (the opening credits, the cut from the matchstick to the desert sunrise, ""nothing is written"" - others too numerous to mention).The point of this rather rambling review is this - a movie that can evoke such passion in its admirers stands by itself, beyond reviews or criticism.

But take everything you see with a pinch of salt: the filmmakers based the script entirely on Laurence's memoirs, and are thus guilty of perpetuating a number of myths, among them:1 the Arab revolt. Myth: the Araba as a people, rose up in revolt against their Turkish overlords. Truth: only those tribes Prince Feisal, and later, Hussein, had direct influence over rose in revolt, the myth of the Arab revolt was largely conceived and perpetuated by Laurence.2 leader of the Arab army. Myth: Laurence was the only Britisher leading Arabs. Truth: Laurence was only one of a number of British and Australian officers assigned to lead Arab forces, although he was arguably the most successful.3 Allenby. Myth: General Allenby was a demanding, unscrupulous man who used Laurence and the Arabs without a second thought. Truth: Allenby had a great deal of respect for Laurence and the Arabs, and vice-versa.4 British inaction. Myth: while the Arabs were busily fighting the Turks, the British were lazing around in Cairo, accomplishing nothing. Truth: at the time of the Film's opening, the British army had already fought the first and second battles of Gaza, and the vast majority of British and Imperial troops were up at the front, closely facing the Turks5 Damascus: The greatest myth of all, and quite libelous. Myth: Laurence and the Arab army made it to Damascus a day and a half before the British got there. Truth: The Australian Light Horse, having crossed 400 miles in 6 weeks, made it into Damascus a day ad a half before Laurence and the Arabs got there.Conclusion: This is not an historically accurate film, so don't watch this for history class, but if it's a good war movie you want, you should try this one out.I give it 8 stars(9 if they hadn't spent a quarter of the film on desert vistas)",Lawrence of Arabia

Be that as it may, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA contains one particular scene that is my favorite out of all the thousands of movies I have viewed over the past 50 years. To my mind, this scene is the most beautiful, most joyous and wonderful cinematic experience.So I would like for you to experience this scene from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA as well, but you must do the following. Watch it on the biggest and best screen available to you, turning up the sound to movie theater volume. Additionally, the scene won't be appreciated unless you watch LAWRENCE OF ARABIA from the very beginning, including ""The Overture"".The scene begins at night, just before sunrise. Lawrence and his ""army"" have succeeded in crossing the ""sun's anvil"" portion of the Nefud desert. Lawrence then notices there is a camel with no rider. It is Gassim's camel; perhaps Gassim fell asleep and fell off the camel and could not catch the camel in time to remount? Lawrence decides to turn back and rescue Gassim if that is the case.This is where the scene begins. It ends when Lawrence, completely exhausted, looks at the ground and falls onto a mat into a deep sleep. Everything that happens in between is the most enjoyable piece of cinematic art I've ever seen and is now there for you to discover and enjoy. This is all I will reveal.",Lawrence of Arabia

This movie also contains the acting by many famous actors. Most important is the film have one of the best direction a film could have. Film has some very dramatic moments such as scary Turkish torture scene and also the large build up to big battle scenes. Film also contain the stunning large amount of extras in the background. No computer gimmick like in the film today. Every person you see in scenes with thousands is actual real person! Film is as good as any film could be.

The cinematography in this movie is unbeaten by anything in its time, or our time for that matter. The film-score is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. The moment at the beginning with black screen and music playing set the mood for the film perfectly and amplified the feeling of anticipation and exhilaration.

It brings to life the war between the Arabs and the Turks, and even brings some understanding of the eternal conflicts in the Mideast.  Even more, it presents a fascinating look into the perplexing character of T.E. Lawrence.  O'Toole makes him more than any ordinary man, conveying him in an almost godlike manner.

Omar Sharif, in the film that made him a star, plays Ali brilliantly.  His raw emotion and chemistry with Lawrence is mesmerizing.  King Feisal is played by the always magnificent Alec Guiness, who shows us that great actors only get better through their movies.  And let us not forget Anthony Quinn, playing Auda abu Tayi.  Quinn has to be one of the greatest actors of his generation.  With Jack Hawkins as Brighton, a star contrast to Lawrence, and Claude Rains who plays the very dry Mr Dryden.

not about establishing peoples' freedom but are instead about making rich
individuals richer and furthering the economic and political interests of the
participating (winning) countries.This film certainly added credence to my opinion of WARS that much more.

Today, it is the disastrous conditions on the locations where David Lean discovered the tracks of trains T.E. Lawrence blew up during his campaign, exactly 100 years ago. Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson authored the script, but is was Lean's direction that created one of the greatest films of all time. The film should be honored now for its prescience. Lawrence wanted to united the Arab tribes. There is no need to remind the current viewer who might take a look at the film and make the appropriate and illuminating comparisons.",Lawrence of Arabia

When we first see Peter O' Toole (Lawrence) he is just a office boy, who is a little bit of a misfit. The higher officers want to wage war against the Turks by using the different and waring tribes of Arabia.We see Lawrence and his guide end up in the sand after an excellent switch cut, it has a great scene which introduced Omar Sheriff to the world and what introduction the mirage effect, one of the amazing scenes in move history, a few dodgy decisions not least Alec Guinness as a Arab prince seems a little misjudged in todays day and age but he is serviceable.The best performance of the whole thing is Laawrence he seems like a man finding his place but that place is just a world of violence, in one scene he admits he loves killing and one point he can't stand to look at his self.If you have not seen It see it.",Lawrence of Arabia

Scenes were from time to time boring and this film wouldn't get as good review if it was published today. Music was nice and once I had to stop watching movie to get inspiration to guitar-riffs ;). Acting was OK with these lines the actors we're given. I could get only some messy ideas of the actors feelings. Battles were cool with all those camels and horses running around.. lot's of money gone to shooting fer sure.Scenery was really nice, whirlwinds and that fusion ball rising at the edge of desert.. Most people probably gave the rating 10 stars out of nostalgia. In the 60's there was probably not many better movies than this. Movie created some interest to know about the history aspects of Middle-East in early of 2000 century. Have Arabs really being so scattered? I have no idea of what really has been.Probably in right mood and bigger screen this could be better. If you are under 35 year old and don't like slower kind of films this could be waste of your time.

511,cdleorivera,Awesometacular,10,2 September 2015,"Lawrence of Arabia stars Peter O'Toole, Alec, Guinness, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and many other stars of their time - 1962. It's about Colonel T.E. Lawrence and he's assigned by the Arab Bureau to act as an adviser to Prince Faisal, the leader of the Arab revolt against the Turks.Let's start with this - Lawrence of Arabia is my favorite movie of all time. Everything from the directing to the acting to the cinematography is stunning an worth experiencing. Everyone in the cast does their best in their roles. My favorite one, however, is Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, the leader of the Howeitat tribe, and he succumbs to the Arab revolt soon after Lawrence promises him money stolen from the Turks at Aqaba. Quinn's portrayal of a greedy yet powerful Arab chieftain is great, and makes for some of the best scenes in the movie. What's even cooler is that Quinn is almost an identical copy of Tayi. If you look up how the character looks in the movie and how he looks in real life, you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference.However, despite the acting powerhouse this movie is, the main character and the best one is the setting - Arabia itself. The stunning shots provided by cinematographer Freddie Young captivate you and make you wonder how such ambitious shots were actually taken. You actually end up feeling for the Arabs because of the development of their land. Via this movie, it's obvious why so many people fell in love with the scenery. Lawrence himself is quoted with saying that he fell in love with the desert because ""it's clean.""When I first saw this, I was fifteen and I had the bought the 25th anniversary edition Blu-ray and watched it in my room by myself. When it was over, I had a similar reaction to what Steven Spielberg had in that I didn't know exactly what I saw other than that it was a masterpiece. So I gave it some time. And within a week, it surpassed Interstellar as my favorite movie of all time. Definitely go check this one out. You'll have to have the patience of a striking tiger, as it's damn near four hours long, but every single minute was worth it. 10/10.",Lawrence of Arabia

The camera work wide desert setting pans and perfectly symbolic angles put any modern piece to utter shame. This is truly the pinnacle of fine camera work and landscape photography that is simultaneousl6 passionate yet nuanced, emotional and unprovoked. The camera work plays into the central brilliance of LOA which is the evocation of emotion. The breathtaking revolutionary score does this effortlesslyThe acting and plot
Lean captures the audiences hearts and feelings with a gut wrenching narrative that is so perfect so human and so empathetic. We believe in Lawrence trust his intentions grieve with him in his failings and celebrate uncontrollably in his victories. Peter O Toole unequivocally deserved an Oscar for this I performance as it would be an injustice not to rank this performance as one of the greatest landmarks in Hollywood acting and storytelling. It is O Tooles expression strange yet believable manners is so and unfailing charm that draw the audience in to the enigmatic eccentric character that is Lawrence of Arabia. His work is art. O Toole showcased the entire range of human emotion and did so not just convincingly but empatheticly. We understand sympathize and grow with Lawrence. The end result is a 3hr and 45min film that passes by so seamlessly and quickly that you long and yearn for more once the credits start rolling.

516,boguspomp,Excellent Movie,10,23 July 2007,"What can you say about such a great movie, that can give the reader an idea of the quality of the visuals, the acting, the story etc ? I had watched LoA before on TV; but as usual with widescreen movies on a 27 inch TV in the 80's, the film didn't leave any impression on me, except, that it's damn long. When in 1989 the remastered, means longer version, came back to the movie theater, I went with friends to see it again. What a difference. Already the prelude with the red curtains still closed beamed me back to the 50's/60's, when all big movies had music to create the right feeling before the movie really started. Great photography, wonderful music that stays with you for weeks, and of course the acting of all the great names make this movie one of the few films, that I can watch over and over again. This film made Peter O'Toole known to the world, as well introduced Omar Sharif to the western world, although he was already a big star in Egypt and other middle eastern countries. The added material - missing for the better part of 27 years - gives a whole new insight to the person of Lawrence and the circumstances of the creation of an Arabic world with united countries, in contrast to hundreds and hundreds of tribes, that were fighting each other all the time. Some critics didn't like the violence, that take place in several scenes; but I believe these scenes of murder and violence only add to the feeling, to watch actually a documentary of what was going on, instead of just watching a mainstream movie. And besides, any PG 13 movies from the last 15 years has far more violence, than any scene in this movie. If you also feel dizzy after couple of minutes, watching modern movies with their in average every 0.8 sec edits and you would love to see wide visuals, that give you the feeling you are in the desert or by the oasis etc, watch this movie and enjoy.",Lawrence of Arabia

Every time I watched I got very sad about the psychological analysis of the English Agent Lawrence. He is fond of Arabs, and he supports Sharif Hussein's rebellion against Ottoman Empire may be something as a Crusader's attitude. He is not a sadist and latent homosexual as mentioned in the film. In the cinema history Lawrence of Arabia should be mentioned as the main monument of David Lean. Charismatic Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif and Alec Guiness made the film excellent with their enormous acting.

518,Marco-7,"Defining film of twentieth century, mankind",10,14 April 1999,"The first time I saw this, I was 15 years old.  It was 12am one night and I had rented it at the library.  It was an old copy (non restoration, on video, but letterbox) yet something powerful made me stay up until 3:30am to watch the whole thing.  After that, I watched it about three more times on video.Two weeks ago, I finally saw it on the big screen, a new 70mm print, on a 70mm projector.  It reaffirmed one thing: this is the most powerful film I've ever seen.  And I can't quite put my finger on the reason why.  It's a little British, which is foreign to me, and is about a time in history I know little about.  Yet, the film makes grandiose statements about humanity, and the capabilities of one man, under the umbrella of some of the finest cinematography I've seen, next to Koyaanisqatsi.The dialogue is simplistic and terse, yet I savor every line and word that I hear.  And Peter O'Toole - man - he should have won the Oscar, just for what he can do with his eyes!  I love this movie, all 3+ hours of it (though the last half hour is my least favorite part, sadly).And even after all this time, I don't know who Lawrence of Arabia really is. This compelled me to buy his book to find out more.  If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now if it's at your theater, or rent the DVD, before you see anything else, new or old.

520,henry-51,The Greatest Film Yet..Lean's Masterpiece,10,6 July 1999,"In an era of box office giants and computer animation, it's good to know that films such as this one, were once made. The present day formula of ""animation and action"" mixed in with mindless screen-writing and assembly line acting, makes one yearn for the days when a film could be epical and yet enjoyable. What makes ""Lawrence of Arabia"" great is quite simple. The effort and endurance that was needed to film for three years, in a hostile and yet magnificent setting, is beyond the imagination of our present day era, of the ""quick"" studio release. This achievement alone, would make ""Lawrence"" one of the greatest ever made, but when one looks past all the visual accomplishments of the film, one sees the real reason it stands above the rest. The screenplay by Robert Bolt(Dr. Zhivago, The Mission) is well timed and presents a believable and yet mildly metaphorical dialogue. ""I can not speak for the place, only for myself"", Lawrence tells Ali, and we and Ali instantly believe him. The actors are all brilliantly cast, especially Omar Sharif and Claude Rains. O' Toole does a great job of making Lawrence seem as if he does indeed control his own destiny, and yet in every scene we see the vulnerability of Lawrence, and his insecurities. Excellently photographed, brilliantly written, and perfectly cast and acted, ""Lawrence of Arabia"", is a metaphor in itself for the landscapes upon which it was filmed. Flawless.",Lawrence of Arabia
521,cj4ta,...On a Level That Will Never Be Matched Again,9,10 October 2002,"I must admit I had never even heard of this movie before seeing its title as #5 on AFI's all-time list. Luckily, a few years later I was able to view this masterpiece in a theater re-release. I must tell you that if you ever get the chance, see this movie in 70mm...and sit close to the screen.The story, acting and direction we all great, but what really impressed me were the visuals. The running time (almost four hours) maybe intimidate some, but this is not a dialog heavy film. It takes its time to tell the story, in a manner which seems to relate more to the experience in Kubrick's 2001, that your typical classic epic.As soon as the first sweeping desert images appeared on screen, my thought was to wonder why they don't make movies like this today. First of all, the clarity of the 70mm picture was unbelievable, putting the `cutting edge' digital projection of Attack of the Clones to shame. In LOA, you could discern even the most minute details: from sand grains blowing over the dunes to a person walking on the horizon a mile away to the individual threads in a persons clothing. While on the other hand, in AOTC, if you sat to close, you began to see the pixels.Secondly, the locations used and unbelievable amount of extras required for some of the shots inspired much more awe in me than any shot in the recent epics like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.  The locations alone, with their otherworldly thousand-feet-high rock formations looked more impressive and fantastic than anything I've seen done up on the computer. And its all real, which is probably why it seems so impressive. I'm surprised these unique areas haven't been the setting for more films. It gave me a whole new idea of what a desert really looks like.Unfortunately, with the economics and costs of today's world, its not longer cost effective to shoot films in this manner anymore. No future movie experience will ever quite match this one.",Lawrence of Arabia
522,jaymasterfunk,Number 1,10,17 February 2006,"Ever since watching this movie for the first time at a young, impressionable age, it has remained in my top 3 of best movies ever. Oh yes, from time to time it has slipped a spot in favour of movies which managed to move me as well. But as fads and favours fade away, it manages to regain the top spot time and time again.I will not rate the overall cinematographic qualities of this extraordinary epic, nor the achievements of its actors, nor the stunning and evocative soundtrack by Maurice Jarre. Others are much more qualified than myself to do so, and they have done so in large numbers on these pages.Of course the movie is not historically accurate. How could it be? After all Lawrence spent years in the Middle East before the war. The Arab revolt was a long series of skirmishes and guerrilla actions over a period of years. To distill that into a movie of the length of this one, one must make certain adaptations and amendments. Lawrence was not the only 'western warrior' involved in the Arab Revolt. But he was - although he played down his own role - one of the most important and influential, even though many soldiers of more importance and higher rank served in the region at the same time. TEL is sometimes portrayed as a somewhat arrogant and self-important. He only became so after the war. In fact, the Lawrence of Arabia legend only broke - I'm simplifying things here - when an American journalist published his accounts of the Arab Revolt after the war and the British authorities felt it would be beneficial to play up the 'British hero in Arabia' act. Lawrence went along with the whole show because he felt it was just another way of advancing the Arab cause through other means. But once its usefulness had gone, he slipped back into anonymity, changing his name and rejoining the British army as a simple foot soldier.If you do not wish to believe everything that is portrayed in this epic movie on sight, by all means read Lawrence's own account, which he wrote down in a literary epic called ""The Seven Pillars of Wisdom"". Read how T.E. puts down the Arabs and their character in the opening chapters, only to confess - by words as well ad deeds - his undying love for them and their world in subsequent chapters. In the end, he became a man trapped between two cultures. A Beduin at heart, but knowing fully well his Western roots prohibited him of ever becoming a true Arab. A British subject by birth, but at unease with the social ambiguity and ruthless political scheming of western society (although he knew most great and influential British leaders of his time personally). A scholar, a brilliant writer, thinker, warrior and strategist. A true genius. But, troubled and unstable as true geniuses are, also just a humble man, stunned and confused at the events he helped shape as much as at the events that shaped him. The movie would have probably embarrassed him to no end. But it does him credit as well.",Lawrence of Arabia
523,vixwatts,unparalleled excellence,10,13 March 2005,"In spite of its length this remains the film I have watched in its entirety more often than any other. It's faultless. Robert Bolt's script is pristine in its economy. Every scene is composed with painterly magnificence and the main acting performances are nuanced in a way that you simply rarely see these days.It is slightly unnerving in the 21st Century to watch a movie in which white men black up to play Arab characters such as Auda and Price Feisel. However, it seems to me that for a film of its time, it remains fairly untainted by essentializing views of the Eastern 'Other'. All the main characters are portrayed with respect for their intelligence and complexity. Anyway, that point aside, this film is really a textbook example of great cinematic storytelling, and storytelling that serves a useful purpose. Current political distrust between the West and the Middle East makes a lot more sense when you know something of the seeds of European political meddling in the region.",Lawrence of Arabia

This film surpasses all other films, mainly in part for its superior screenplay and dialogue. The movie is loaded with various motiffs and symbols. The overall theme of the movie is the psychological transformation of T.E.Lawrence. The switch of personalities between Lawrence and Ali is all too apparent. Lawrence after all, suffers an identity crisis throughout the film. Lawrence first starts off as a humble soldier. Once he undergoes his mission to ""appreciate the situation"" he states that he will accomplish a ""miracle"" which he eventually does. From there he compares himself to Moses as he crosses Sinai. He eventually goes so far as to compare himself to Christ as he walks in splendor and transfigured white on top of the train. He shortly thereafter states that he will ""walk on water"". He however not only comes back down to earth, but he sinks to the bottom, covered with mud and filth after his rape by the Turks. He even goes so far as to cover himself with a filthy cloak. He however cannot cover the bloody scars on his back (this is about as close to Christ as he gets), which are a result of the Turks' torture.I will not proceed to describe the rest of the deep elements of the movie. Just bear in mind that the movie begins with a motorcycle and ends with one. The more you see the film the more you will love understand it. It is this quality which sets movies apart.

I'd never seen a film where the 'hero'was so flawed. It forced me to think that there was more to this film and its depiction of its main character than what I'd seen in movies with the usual Hollywood formula of romance.Its images are indelibly inscribed in my mind. The ""cut"" from Dryden's office to the sunrise in the desert by the simple act of Lawrence blowing out a match,  the introduction of Ali from a mirage image in the far distance, the shot of the well from inside, Lawrence acting the fool with his new robes, the attack on Acquaba, the 'drowning' of boy in the sands, the sudden image of the ship and the Suez...... etc.  Unforgettable images from a master director.",Lawrence of Arabia

Performances from Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are standouts.  Whenever I see an adventure movie today, I lament that epics like this are hardly ever attempted anymore, and when they are, directors and producers choose to substitute digital effects for storytelling.

By that standard, I believe this to be the best war film ever made. It lays out the facts & lets the viewers draw their own conclusions. Moreover, this film has one other attribute necessary for a film to be great; it is entertaining! 😎",Lawrence of Arabia

540,elldbry772,"""Well nil nisi bonum....""",10,16 April 2020,"Epic, this word has become part of modern day slang. So therefore it is often overused. It makes me laugh every time, because this movie is the standard of epic that makes everything else fall short. Big things have small beginnings, or so I'm told. Just like T.E. Lawrence map maker and obscure British army officer stationed in Arabia. He goes on an adventure to fight the Turks, while being assimilated into the Arab culture. The movie's director, David Lean, had a problem: how do you create Arabia and cast Arab actors. Don't, instead go to Arabia and make the locals part of your movie. Have the major speaking roles done by the best actors you can get and respect the characters they are playing. Also find the right man to play Lawrence. Who can show a man who is out of his element and does not fit in at all, and convince you he is part of his adopted culture. Cast Peter O'Toole. O'Toole is one of the best. His role takes him from the basement of British army headquarters to the charge at the Port City of Aqaba. Only a few men can make that journey, and only few actors can play that man. But sometimes you need one extra ingredient. Omar Sharif, who plays Sharif Ali, was to charge at Aqaba with O'Toole. Sharif was in his tent sitting at a table. O'Toole walks in and with Sharif still in costume looks like a nun with a mustache. Finally O'Toole asks 'what are you doing Omar?' Sharif 'I'm working out the odds Peter.' 'Odds?' 'Yes, the odds of the camel falling over during the charge, or me falling off the camel.' 'I see and what have you decided?' 'It is more likely for me to fall off the camel.' 'What are you going to do?' 'I'm going to tie myself to the camel.' 'Well Omar I'm going to get drunk.' 'Oh Peter I'm going to get drunk too.' So on the day of the charge where T.E. Lawrence leads his army against the Turkish stronghold at Aqaba. That made one reviewer call the look on O'Toole's and Sharif's face as 'Messiahanic zeal', the actors had no idea what was happening. The best scene in the movie and O'Toole doesn't know where the heck he is going, doing and riding or when to stop. Luckily the camel stopped at the ocean and the last thing O'Toole saw was Sharif's camel running up with Sharif tied to the camel but rolled over under the camel's belly. That is acting I suppose. The music is also epic, the sound of the desert, a great terrain that needs a soundtrack to bring out the grandeur of the desert. From violent heat to mind bending mirages the desert became another character in the movie. That character is under the rule of Prince Faisal, although he is warring with the Turks. Alec Guiness plays the prince, in one of the most respectful cross ethnicity portrayals you can get. People who knew the actual prince would say that Guiness' mannerisms, voice cadence, and demeanor were so close to the real prince they did not care that he was a Brit. Anthony Quinn plays Auda Abu Tayi, chief of a Bedouin tribe that joins Lawrence's cause. And in pure Quinn style steals the screen with his intensity and memorable lines. The film took two years to make, as long and as tough as the journey through the Nefud desert. However the legacy of Lawrence of Arabia is nearly incomparable. So many filmmakers marvel at it to the point where they think there is absolutely no way they can make a movie as good. If you wanted to remake it the way the original was made it would cost close to three hundred million dollars. And if you did it with special effects and modern techniques it would be so fake it would be unwatchable. I was able to watch it after hearing about it's grandeur and epic story, and I agree with the masses. It is one of the best with it's elements entertaining to this day. That includes me and it is one of my favorites.""...home, sir.""",Lawrence of Arabia

The filming and acting in this film show what real trained pros can do when they do real history, not fiction. I wish more movies like this could be made. Love to see Bruce Willis, as Captain Lewis.

542,adam-oshaughnessy,A Truly Remarkable Film,10,6 August 2003,"Recently bought the DVD, and took the time to really watch the film. For those who have never seen it properly before, it may seem a tad long and hard to keep up with the first time, or even the second. Watch it again, and you will know that it is one of the best films ever made. The magic element - the thing that ultimately makes this movie great - is Mr. Peter O'Toole. He portrays the legendary T.E.Lawrence, a man whose soul becomes captured by the desert and its people. He is a man who believes he can achieve the impossible, a man who believes he can unite and lead the independent Bedouin tribes to rise against tremendous odds and become a nation. Although Peter O'Toole comes across as somewhat odd in some of the pictures that I have seen him in, In Lawrence of Arabia he is simply... immense. The sort of performance that burns into the memory. In fact if all the other movies he had ever done were no good at all he could still be rightly considered one of the greatest movie stars of all time, thats how good this one is. The second magic element in this film is the desert itself. No movie before or since has captured it in nearly the same way although many have tried to emulate. Were talking leagues ahead here. The beauty of it will blow your mind. Give this movie a chance and you'll appreciate it for what I do now, a masterpiece.",Lawrence of Arabia
543,Fenwayswimmer,The Greatest War Involved Film,10,19 August 2012,"There was one time when I showed my little brother Lawrence of Arabia. We had recently watched The Bridge on the River Kwai, another Lean favorite of mine, which he didn't love, but enjoyed. Once finishing LOA, however, he just said something that many others would agree with: ""That was way too long."" Okay, he got me. At three hours and forty-two minutes, perhaps the film is too long. But not for me. The first time I watched the film, it glued me to my seat. My mother called me up to dinner, and I just canceled it out. The first time Spielberg saw it, he couldn't even comprehend the effect it had on him. That was exactly how it went for me as well. It was a film that was dull at moments, but then snuck up and floored me. There has never been better editing in any film. Ever. At one moment, Lawrence picks up a match and blows it out. The next shot is of a red sunrise. This is the greatest transition of all time. It is a film showing not only the beauty of a land, but the characterization of the human being. It is not just a biopic. It is the most important biopic ever made. T.E. Lawrence, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Don Corleone, is one of the most extraordinary characters ever put to film. The only difference is that the character was based off of a true person. But much like Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, the film version of Lawrence was very fictitious. He was changed to make the film more interesting. And boy, was it ever interesting.",Lawrence of Arabia
544,zepher_blue,A brilliant film,10,30 January 2005,"As this film ended, I sat thinking ""how could anyone make a film this great?"" For a while, I didn't think I could watch another movie after seeing Lawrence of Arabia, because no other film could compare! As I slowly came back to reality, I realized how little I knew about the history behind this movie. Of course I knew about the war, but I never really knew about the Arabs' struggle and fight as they fought to preserve their way of life. This movie made me want to learn more and read up about the Arab's side. I also became very interested in T.E. Lawrence himself. The inner struggles he has of loving a country but being unable to live there because of his race was very thought provoking. The director, David Lean, does a spectacular job, especially depicting those long desert scenes; I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. David Lean also directed another excellent film ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" (no wonder I liked it so much); however, no film can compare with Lawrence of Arabia.Peter O'toole does an EXCELLENT (for lack of a better word) performance in this movie; he is just as the ""real Lawrence"" was. I personally don't believe the quiet, intuitive Lawrence could have been played by any other person. He is a truly spectacular, hard working actor. There is no other like him. How come you no longer see great movies like Lawrence of Arabia anymore? Lawrence of Arabia is a classic example of a film that took a long time to make, took a lot of money, good actors, and just plain determination. Nowadays, no one cares about the quality of the movie, they just want to throw a bunch of scenes together and whip out the movie as fast as the producers can. All anyone cares about is the money aspect of it...they want to make a big profit. How come we can't make a good quality movie anymore? Is it because no one is capable of doing it anymore? Did we forget how to make a good film? No...it's because all the film industry cares about is money. In the few cases where someone DOES make a good movie, the theaters don't show it because they fear it will lose money. It makes me disgusted. Ugh. Thankfully, however, we can go to the video store and check out a movie like Lawrence of Arabia. If it wasn't for that, I don't know what I would do.",Lawrence of Arabia

If you decide to watch the film, you may also be interested in learning about the real T.E. There are several websites offering in-depth information about him: look for T.E. Lawrence Studies, the T.E. Lawrence Society, and Clio Visualizing History (they have a video, by Lowell Thomas, of the real Lawrence, plus a ton of photos of him, also the real Prince Feisal). I've given the film a rating of ""9"" only because I think the use of make-up was a little too heavy. I realize this was the style at the time, and it's only a tiny detraction.

This movie was supposed to be one of the greatest movies of all time, ranking somewhere near the Godfather or Shawshank Redemption. My dad said he only saw it one time when he was a kid and didnt remember it, and that he would watch it again with me.  What I saw was the biggest waste of over 3 hours of my life.  I dont understand how this movie was such a big hit.  It could have been an hour shorter and it still would have been too long. All the desert scenes were actually starting to make me thirsty. The camera tried to portray Peter O Toole as this Jesus-like character, but ended up making him look like some homosexual weakling.  Dont believe me?  Then watch how he walks.  Or the look on his face when he killed that man. I kept thinking ""Ok, maybe the good part's coming up,"" right up until the end. And then it struck me that this is the most overrated movie of all time.  When the movie was over, my dad punched me on the arm, I was like what was that for, and he said ""I would have rather seen paint dry.""  And I almost cried, not from the punch, but because I agreed with him. The only good part in the movie was when they whipped him.  I wish they would have whipped me for watching it.

547,OmegaTravis,Lawrence of Arabia is a visually stunning epic.,10,11 October 2013,"Lawrence of Arabia is a visually stunning epic from acclaimed director David Lean (The Bridge on the River Kwai) On the visual side of things, this film is made to be shown on a big screen, with it's jaw dropping desert vistas and blue skies. It also helps to have the whole home cinema experience because the dramatic score by Maurice Jarre is incredibly beautiful and really sets the mood. For those unfamiliar with the movie, i'm sure you've heard the soundtrack sampled many a times in pop culture shows such as The Simpsons. On the acting side of things it features an incredible performance from actor Peter O'Toole who portrays T.E Lawrence in the film. O'Toole gives Lawrence quite a bit of depth and humanity and his unique mannerisms make him fascinating to watch. One thing to note: Be weary, the film goes for a whopping 3 hours and 47 minutes, so clear your schedule before sitting down to watch this classic film. Of course it does have an intermission about halfway through.I recommend buying this film and blu ray.

548,mggoulden,LOTR Doesn't Come Anywhere Near Close,10,23 February 2005,"Given the recent spate of apparently excellent biographies - ""The Aviator"", ""Ray"", ""Finding Neverland"" (I'm yet to see any of these) - and also a rediscovered delight of moviegoers in watching movies on an epic scope and length, the effect of Lawrence of Arabia on any competent movie lover is even stronger. It is without doubt the best film in both of these popular categories.There are so many great things to say about this piece of brilliance: music, editing, acting are all top notch; but ultimately it is all about David Lean - one of the best directors of the 20th Century. There is never any doubt of the deserving ""epic"" tag that so many people place upon it, but is the study of character which sets ""Lawrence"" above all other pretenders. Character vs scale is a balancing act that is extraordinarily hard to pull off in a movie of this scale. Modern audiences have to compare it to recent examples: Peter Jackson tried - and failed - to do it in his brilliant LOTR adaptations, Mel Gibson butchered history in Braveheart, and Spielberg has never married the two perfectly, but David Lean shows both here and in Doctor Zhivago that he was the consummate master.Spielberg himself adores this movie (praise from a director who's movies have grossed more than any other is high praise indeed!) and it's not hard to see why. At a length of over 4 hours, ""Lawrence"" flies by, which considering there were moments in LOTR which had me fidgeting in my seat in potential boredom is testament to the brilliance of the storytelling.There has never been anything better than this - except perhaps another of David Lean's very best.

Aside from the unbelievable cast, haunting score, and superb acting (particularly O'Toole's Lawrence... even better in the director's cut which shows additional facets of O'Toole's character development), the film demonstrates the most effective tactics employed in asymmetrical warfare... hit and run strikes on soft targets like Aqaba and Turkish railroad/supply lines. These are the tactics currently being utilized in Iraq, and we could learn valuable lessons, namely that the Sykes-Picot agreement and its arbitrary national boundaries, combined with the dishonesty of the British has been a great factor in the ever-present unrest that has plagued the region since the days of Lawrence. Perhaps we would also be wise to note that a superpower has NEVER defeated a well-established insurgency.

He invited me to the opening of the restoration in Los Angeles, and I was introduced to Omar Shariff. Unfortunately, the Cineplex Odean in Centuty City has been demolished to make way for a modern office complex. The demolition of this movie house coincides with the demolition of movie making in this town.The scene of Ali coming into view on the desert is the best piece of cinematography I have ever seen. This movie prompted my wife and I to travel through Syria, Jordan and Israel, where this movie takes place. I brought with me on this trip Lawrence's autobiography, ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"". I used this book to instruct my car and guide to take me to all of the places that Lawrence visited in Syria and Jordan. I even hired a 4 wheel drive vehicle to take me into Wadi Rum, the canyon that Lawrence sung Tum Te tum Te tum. The place really echoed. My Bedu driver took me to a cave at the end of the Wadi where I was introduced to a very old Bedouin who fought with Lawrence during the ""Arab Revolt"". There was even graffiti on the wall of the cave written by Lawrence's followers.Before Lawrence involved himself in the ""Arab Revolt"" he lived among the Arabs in the land once called ""The Ottoman Empire"", which was administered out of Constantinople. His book discussed his visit to the most preserved Crusader Castle still in existence today in Syria, north of Damascus, Craque DE Chevalier, where the Crusaders held off Saladin during a great siege.That movie and my visit will never be erased from my memory.

The moments of suspense when you see a character approach from afar, barely visible yet aching closer and closer is just amazing.Our main character is very interesting, conflicted about his loyalty and traumatised by the violence, yet he seems to be obsessed with the almost godlike status he receives from the Arabs. I thought this film was going to have this 'white saviour' complex, something you might expect when looking at the plot and the year it was made. Luckily, this only becomes really apparent near the end of the film, so good job on keeping it woke for like three hours.It's only real issue here is its length. 220 minutes is just too long.

This was exposed when they had technical difficulties starting the second half.Aside from its awards for film mastery it is unique in that there is a 15-minute intermission after a couple of hours. There are five to ten minute musical preludes to each half of the production. At 222 minutes it is only a couple of minutes longer than Gone With The Wind and the longest movie to win a Best Picture Oscar.From the time I first saw it in early 1963 at the then multi-hundred seat Carlton Theatre in Toronto (next to the old Maple Leaf Gardens) it remains in my memory as the best film production I have seen over time. The amazing Super Panavision 70 cinematography, Maurice Jarré's symphonic musical accompaniment and the overall sound established new performance standards. More surprisingly is that, even today, the script is not out-dated, with its philosophical musings, innuendos and double entendres. The plot, covering and exposing the complexities and emotions of the constantly challenged soldier is still gripping and keeps you on the edge throughout (I have now seen it five or six times over the years).The scenes of Arab tribal armies on the move are epic for their coverage of hundreds of riders thundering through each such scene. With its desert panoramas and these scenes of undisciplined herds of camel and horseback riders, it is really best seen on the large screen. It was perhaps the first movie to show the full advantage of, what was then, relatively new wide screen 70 mm film technology. The sound and music is still ringing in my ears hours later. To absorb it totally on even the best of today's home theatre systems would be a challenge .For all the video and sound technology available today, Lawrence of Arabia established a new movie theatre experience that is only mildly embellished by today's technology.Bottom line: Lawrence of Arabia remains an epic and one of the greatest films ever produced, withstanding the test of time.

568,arickamarie,Lawrence of Arabia,9,12 October 2006,"Lawrence of Arabia is a biographical film, directed by David Lean, of T.E. Lawrence, taken from the autobiography ""The Seven Pillars of Wisdom."" T.E. Lawrence is a British lieutenant who is stationed in Arabia. He was sent into the deserts to report about the conflicts in Arabia concerning national movements from 1916-1918, but Lawrence comes back loving the Arabs, and decides to help them fight for their freedom against the Ottoman Empire.I thought this film to be absolutely magnificent, especially in respect to the breathtaking scenery captured. Lawrence of Arabia is made in the deserts of Morocco and Jordan. The scenery is very big, most of the time the characters in the shot are tiny in comparison to the large mountains, canyons, desert sands, and etcetera. The view is great, and makes you want to jump into your TV screen.The soundtrack is also brilliant, composed by Maurice Jarre. He uses orchestra filled with very bold sounds, a lot of the time glorifying the Arabs and their victories. It really fits the mood with the film, however a lot of times the soundtrack is overwhelming, and I had to turn down the volume at certain moments. There are also a few scenes in which silence is used, in moments of uncertainty and nervousness. This technique was used very well and we really get a sense of the anxiety that is felt by the characters.The cinematography and editing was also very creative and unique. A lot of times the camera uses shots to jump further into time. For example, the dust in the desert fills the screen, and once it is blown away, we are taken to an event further in the story. There aren't many close-up shots, but the shots that are close-up are on faces, which are full of expression.The performances of the characters were captivating. Peter O'Toole, Lawrence, was actually a new actor, but his performance does not show it. His facial expressions are amazing, and very down to earth. Through his expressions and body movement, we get a feeling for his glory filled personality, as well as his confusion about who he is, and what he wants. The performance of Omar Sharif was brilliant. He portrays his character with much enthusiasm, and we really get to know his character. One scene in particular was his encounter with Lawrence for the first time. We really get a sense of his motivation to protect his well and his lands by foreigners and other tribes. However, once he is a best friend of Lawrence's, we are able to see his loyalty and bravery towards those he loves. All of the characters were very down to earth, and in a way, easy to connect to, in a sense that they seemed real.Lawrence of Arabia was pretty much a glorious movie, and should be seen by everyone. It has a lot of different aspects that could intrigue all movie lovers. It joins adventure, drama, and war all into one to try and get to know this T.E. Lawrence who is struggling with loyalty to his country and his love for a people. In my opinion, this movie should be rated at a 9.0, and I would recommend this to everyone; it is a ""must see"".",Lawrence of Arabia
569,jkiddnrg,The Ultimate Movie,10,10 June 2020,David Lean transports you as a viewer into the middle of this epic story. I cant think of a movie that can surpass this film as far as how purely cinematic it is. It also has one of the greatest performances of all time by the screen commanding Peter O'Toole. The cinematography and score on in a league of their own. This has been my favorite movie from the first time I watched it and is the main inspiration for my love of films in general. An unforgettable epic!,Lawrence of Arabia
570,hpags,"Boring, painfully slow",3,31 January 2002,"Would have received a 1 if not for the good acting and great cinematography. This is the clearest example of the fact that great acting and great filming do not necessarily make a good movie.  However, many people don't realize that.  Do you realize there is a 4 minute-long scene of a man just walking in the desert- no music, no dialogue, nothing.  That is what America calls entertainment?",Lawrence of Arabia
571,one_and_only005,Best film ever?,10,2 April 2007,"I think Lawrence of Arabia can be not summed up, but described in one scene. A British officer, T.E. Lawrence is in Cairo, and has just been re-assigned to the Arab Biro. As he lights his friend's cigarette, he then takes the match, holding it up in front of his face, watches as it slowly burns. He then softly blows the flame out, as we cut to a dark orange horizon on a desert plain. We are first stunned by the vastness of the deep horizon. As we watch, the faintest hint of yellow sun is seen coming over what seems the edge of the world. As the masterful score quietly begins to play, the sun slowly works it's way into the world's view. As the music reaches a climax, we cut to what seems the most beautiful shot of desert land space that we could possibly imagine. Through the massive dunes and thunderous mountains, we see two riders appear in a valley of sand. And so thus begins the greatest epic of all time.After watching Lawrence of Arabia, it becomes impossible to call any other film epic. Even the modern classics such as the Lord of the Rings are no where near the shear size and scope of David Lean's masterpiece. If only every movies were this well made. The 5 month shoot that was planned spanned into a 2 year marathon of film making brilliance. In current Hollywood, if we are to be shown a massive epic army, we are given 2000 CGI soldiers on a totally made up landscape. This is not the way David Lean saw the way films are made. In Lawrence of Arabia, we a blessed with armies and extras upon the thousands, each one with a costume, makeup, most of the time horses or camels and most importantly, a character to embody.There are few words to describe Peter O'Toole as Lawrence and one of them may be ""best performance ever?"". Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and the legendary Alec Guinness, all give spell binding performances in this already massive master work. David Lean's vision is beyond epic. There is no word to describe it. There are very few films that truly stunning cinematography, with this being the very best. No film has as beautiful and stunning visuals as Lawrence. Lean's capture of the heat and vastness of the desert is simply unbelievable.This film is beyond amazing and truly something that is beyond a miracle. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 1962 and winner of 7, this is one classic that will never die. Lawrence will always be a legend.""Nothing is Written""",Lawrence of Arabia

How David Lean developed the characters in the story is part of what makes the movie great. The scenes are seamless. A documentary about David Lean's life portrayed him as a perfectionist. I am glad of that. This great movie could not have been made by any other type of person. Peter O'Tool playing the lead role was probably a double edged sword,it was his first and greatest role. Where does anyone go from the top? The ""chemistry"" between actor Alec Guiness and Sir David Lean was just as powerful as it was between Humphrey Bogart and John Huston.

So brilliant on so many levels, acting, screenplay, photography, costume design, set decoration and above all direction. David Lean is by far my favorite director and his influence can be seen in countless other films. Peter O'Toole is by far my favorite actor and this is probably his greatest performance, although The Ruling Class is equally stunning. If you would like some insight into the huge mess in the Middle East, this is one film you must watch. Martin Scorsese commented that ""Lawrence"" could never be made today. I agree but for different reasons. I do not think there is any director alive today who has the insight, the patience or the work ethic that was needed to make ""Lawrence"" Devoting millions of dollars to an intelligent historic epic would also be something that today's movie makers would never venture into. David Lean was one of the last of a dying breed of precise filmmakers (Kubrick being the other) that went to any lengths and expense to get just the right shot.",Lawrence of Arabia

Firstly-in my opinion David Lean was the greatest film director of all time. He had a superb true story,fantastic locations,a great cameraman, a totally mesmerising score and a PERFECT cast. The movie had everything except humour which was not suitable. I shed more tears in THIS movie than almost any other at the way Lawrence was used and abused(literally in one episode)for the interests? of the British and French but certainly not for the Arabs and the future of the Middle East. There were more individual memorable and moving scenes in Lawrence than I can remember in any other. The one where Daud died in a quicksand was truly heartbreaking.I have seen Lawrence four times and I would watch it again!",Lawrence of Arabia
580,rmullin,The Epic of Epics,10,23 October 2001,"Lawrence of Arabia, with apologies to ""Citizen Kane"" is simply the finest film ever made.  I was twelve when I first saw the picture; it has stood the test of time and it is the master work of a master craftsman.  David Lean made cinema history with this beautifully filmed motion picture.  He went against the odds by casting a complete unknown, Irish stage actor Peter O'Toole, who had the facial resemblance to the real Lawrence, but was close to being over a foot taller, something the historians have not overlooked. O'Toole has enjoyed a noteworthy career, garnering five Oscar nominations for Best Actor, but Lawrence was his climatic role; a role of a life time. Not to be out done, Lean cast the virtually unknown (in the West) Egyptian actor, Omar Sharif in the supporting role of Sheik Ali.  It could argued of Sharif that he might have had the greatest entrance and exit in one film in movie history.  Lean surrounded these unknown actors with a supporting cast of such excellence that there names alone are legendary; Alec Guinness (an outstanding portrayal as King Feisal), Anthony Quinn (in a starry spin as the imprudent Auda ibu Tayi), Jose Ferrer past Oscar winners all; plus the always reliable Jack Hawkins, Arthur Kennedy, Anthony Quayle along with the great Claude Rains.  To tell the story of such a complicate and enigmatic man as TE Lawrence was not a trivial feat and I will not begin to try here. But as a film biography, we can measure the end result.  With the accomplished Robert Bolt, multi-award winning John Box and the lasting musical score of the finest movie composer of his generation (Maurice Jarre), Lean left no stone unturned in his pursuit for excellence.  He used Sam Spiegal's money well.  Within the film is not one, but a number of magical scenes that never leave the memory: Lawrence blows out the match turning it into the Sun; like a mirage Ali confronts Lawrence at the water hole; at Auda's camp with Auda exclaiming ""I am but a river to my people""; the crossing of the Nefud desert and the Devil's Anvil; the spectacular attack on Akaba; the ""take no prisoners"" scene; the train derailment--all terrific stuff and all original.  Steven Spielberg has stated that he was most influenced by Lean and he, Spielberg, could not afford to make Lawrence of Arabia today, too expensive he said, it would cost over $250M or more to produce, and besides he said, ""it wouldn't be as good as the original, the best movie ever made.""  Beat that for a ultimate review!",Lawrence of Arabia
581,alexnorcott_3,The Best of the Best,10,21 September 2007,"Lawrence Of Arabia will go down as one of the greatest movies ever made - if not THE best...i can't think of a simple flaw in this movie; everything in it is just powerful and astonishing. The cinematography was highly advanced for its time (especially the sunrise clip - which, for all you people who are a fan of modern CGI cinema, was a REAL clip..not fake!) Artists are what created this masterpiece. I am extremely pleased that LOA was a huge success with the academy - especially with David Lean who deserved the Oscar immensely, as he represents the honour of the British; considering British film-makers/actors have been ripped off by the Academy (Hitchcock,Harris, Burton, Sellers, and NOW O'TOOLE!!!!). Now talking about the Academy ripping off the British; this movie is the perfect example - Peter O'Toole!!!! His performance in this is ranked 1st on many lists of ""The greatest movie performances of all time"" (above Brando's 'On the waterfront' performance) and yet he was never acknowledged properly...his performance was memorizing. He made T.E look eccentric and strange, but truly special and unique in the first five minutes on screen!...his performance developed throughout; from the moral genius and good man - to the arrogant and war-obsessed general (he basically BECAME one of the barbaric Arabs). His performance is in my opinion THE greatest ever! The supporting roles were also stunning - Omar Sharif's superior warrior presence, yet emotionally vulnerable Sheriff Ali and Anthony Quinn's bad ass Auda Abu Tayi really captured the mentality and human environment of arabia during Lawrence's campaign. Guinness and Hawkins were also excellent...The screenplay is also incredible; Spielberg said that it was ""the greatest screenplay ever written for a motion picture"".

Perhaps that was the point. I thought certain key scenes and characters were overplayed, especially those involving sheik Auda.Like all epics it has its moments of vulgarity in the mass action scenes - these are unavoidable I guess - but the beauty and harshness of the desert have never been captured more perfectly on film.All in all, a film of rare excellence and vision.",Lawrence of Arabia

The cast is amazing, especially Peter O'Toole. With one look you know how he feels, and you can see his character progress and change throughout the film. Omar Sharif gives a passionate performance that actors would kill for these days. There is not a performance in this movie that's less than perfect.And if anyone's worried about how long it is, they really shouldn't be.

588,tetonicwolf,Different version of Lawrence of Arabia,10,2 September 2009,"Movie viewers: I saw the movie Lawrence of Arabia for the first time during 1989 at the Cine Capri movie theater in Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America. During the scene where Lawrence is talking to King Faisal in the tent Faisal states the following, ""Truth and ambition, these are the traits of young men. Mistrust and suspicion, these are the traits of older men."" I am paraphrasing what was said and can not be sure of the exact verbiage that was used. Unfortunately this scene was cut from the video cassettes and DVD's I have seen. I noticed that the films original date is 1962. I believe I saw the original version and not the restored version dated 1989.I called Harkins Cinemas in Scottsdale, Arizona (the company that owned the Cine Capri movie theater) and they do not have any records to indicate what movie version was shown during 1989. Unfortunately the Cine Capri was torn down and the property where it stood is now a parking lot.I called Gail McDonald, Archivist at Sony Pictures Entertainment (owner of Columbia Pictures Corp.) and she was not able to help determine why there was a difference in the movie I saw during 1989 in Phoenix, Arizona.Can anyone explain why this scene where Lawrence and King Faisal in the tent was cut? Have you seen this version of the movie yourself? The day I saw this film it ended at 12 midnight. There was a huge crowd outside the theater waiting to see the last Indiana Jones film staring Harrison Ford which was being released for the first viewing early in the morning.

I am no plot hound or action junky, but lets speed things up shall we! Sweeping cinematography cannot carry a movie.  I can't emphasize enough how lacking this movie is in story.  We get exactly nowhere after two hours of following Peter O'Toole, and after that it gets worse!  All of those who vote on movies without seeing them, please, I challenge you, have a look at this thing again and change your vote.I believe this is the first time I've ever recommended a movie in order to prove how awful it is.  It's time we took this one off the shelf.  It's been sitting too long.  And if you need proof, just have a quick sniff before you poor it down the drain.  I guarantee you won't be able to stand it for more than a few minutes.I would also suggest the IMDB people do the same.  Times change, and good stories are what make good movies.

The movie is serious and sad but has humor and well written drama included. Omar Sharif plays a very important role as well and his acting is superb.The relationships that build across the desert will make you feel as if you are there with them. Even though this movie is long, with an intermission even, you will be sad that the movie ends. You will not want it to. It is that entertaining.I loved the Prince of Faisal also as his voice is perfect of that of a Prince of Royalty.

After seeing it recently, it's more clear than ever that this is one of the great movies ever filmed. Peter O'Toole gives one of the greatest performances ever captured on film, and the all-star cast has fit into an unparalled story which has few equal in this history of film. One of the great portrayals of a 20th century icon; a rebel who changed the face of the Middle East, but died too young. Peter O'Toole, who has, again and again, shown himself to be one of the great actors of the 20th century (Lord Jim, The Lion in Winter, Goodbye Mr. Chips, My Favorite Year, etc.). He's an amazingly accomplished actor, who can dominate the screen in whatever role he's playing. I don't know of any actor of the 20th century who has appeared in more ""four star"" films than Mr. O'Toole. He is one of the few who can be proved to be an actor who transforms a mediocre movie into a great film. I believe he's one of the best; without parallel in film. ""nuff said.",Lawrence of Arabia

But I came away amazed from this movie. The desert setting  and everything that revolves around it is a big reason, along with the story and acting. Even though a desert may seem like a barren flat open nothingness, this movie makes it into a eye dazzling, mystical place. The acting is very well done as well. Peter O'Toole who plays Lawrence gives an excellent performance, Lawrence first appears  ambitious, adventerous, and content at the beginning of the movie. But half way through after he has to kill someone that he himself saved, and loses those close to him you begin to see a multiple tiered charecter. I would definetly compare O'Toole's performance with Al Pacino in ""The Godfather"" (which is another old film thats in my top 5) in terms of complexity and brilliance.

Hollywood productions on the 50´s 60´s and almost 70´s were a high quality ones, they considered from the biggest to the smallest detail! and of course the casts were extremely well-chosen. Lawrence of Arabia is a great example of the Hollywood I miss deeply. Although I watched it at the first time in Spanish I almost felt what the director wanted to make on the audience: Feel the power of the story, the acting and the score! I think the score (made by Maurice Jarre) and the Director of photography have done a great job of course led by legendary David Lean and hardworking Sam Spiegel!Then I watched the film in English and on a high quality DVD and I just got too impressed! The union of music, photography, great crew and unforgettable and legendary cast have made this film one of the best in time, Oscar winning, and stay in every decade of our lives!

Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies (here I am not talking about child-adult joke partitioning popular among modern American full length cartoons). Up on the top you can clearly see the feat of a man alien to the local culture being able to gain respect, popularity and even loyalty among the people of the Arabia. Very well written dialogues and subtle acting deliver the deeper level containing some insights on the cultural conflict of that time between the East and the West particularly from the individual perspective. Often we hear remarks from Lawrence about the Arabian people: his dual attitude is clearly shown. The centuries old argument on why the Arab world is seemingly underdeveloped has also been discussed. There are many other things that I think I noticed but it's not worth discussing them all here. That's why I advise the viewers watch the movie very carefully so that no detail is missed because in a movie of that quality almost no detail is redundant.",Lawrence of Arabia
600,seth_mitchell,Too Long,6,24 April 2004,"I recently watched this film hoping to see a great classic.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations.Firstly, I thought the film was far too long, and could have very easily been cut down to make a shorter, more entertaining film.  The beginning was good, but by the half way point I couldn't wait for it to end.  It's not just that I don't like long films (many of my favourite films are more than three hours), but I thought that the same story could have been compressed to a much shorter length without losing anything important.Secondly, although the acting was good, I didn't think that the main character, Lawrence, was anything of a hero.  In my opinion, he seemed sadistic and insane (especially by the end), and for this reason I felt it hard to enjoy the film.Thirdly, the fact that the film opens with death of Lawrence, I think hangs over you while you're watching it.  In my opinion, this scene was unnecessary, and the way he dies seems unfit for the hero he's made out to be.I didn't enjoy this film nearly as much as I thought I would, and although there are some good parts so it (like the amazing setting, good acting and the first half), it was far too long and boring and I didn't like the story or the characters.",Lawrence of Arabia

Is Lawrence as depicted here a hero, or anti-hero? Rather than debate the politics and tribalisms and nationalisms at play in the story--many of which plague our world and its various peoples to this day--I'd rather celebrate the magnificence of this masterpiece. Film is a visual language, and no film David Lean made ever came as close to dialogue-free action as this one. Sequences like Ali's arrival at the well and the rescue of Gasim are self-contained works of art unto themselves. In our hyper-sensitive times, some casting choices may strike us as infelicitous; political correctness aside, Guinness's wordless moments as Faisal listening to Lawrence in the tent conference are exquisite examples of film acting at its finest.

602,DWengelin,"The most pompous, amazing and beautiful environment we have seen on screen",8,27 July 2013,"So, to start of, I would like to say that this is one of few movies with such amazing environment. Beautiful, and not to mention pompous. David Lean, the director of the film do deserve all the credits he have received. David Lean was able to catch the smallest particle in the desert and make it to the most extraordinary thing you have seen on screen your entire life. But, not to forget, there are two other gentlemen we got to mention and care for. Freddie Young, the photographer and Peter O'Toole himself. Freddie Young's accomplishment with using widescreen and different image compositions is beyond compare! Peter O'Toole with his sparkling blue eyes and his interpretation of T.E Lawrence is peerless. These three men each have a significant part in the work of the classic Lawrence of Arabia. What if David Lean didn't direct the movie, whom would then catch those precious views as David Lean did? Or what if David Lean had chosen Albert Finney as T.E Lawrence (as was planned)? We do not know, we'll never know. But one thing is absolutely sure. A removal of just a few people from the team of Lawrence of Arabia could have ended in an absolute disaster. Everyone had their function.",Lawrence of Arabia
603,phileo80,The transformation of Lawrence exhibits characteristics of the human lust for power and ego,10,7 January 2005,"This films impact not only extends to cinematography and the value of some of the dialogue. O'Toole's portrayal of TE Lawrence and his transformation from a man that abhors blood and violence to one that is caught up in his own image, possibly as a prophet, maybe as a general, it does not matter which. We see a man, brought up in a theoretical and educated realm. Even with his military background, from the onset, Lawrence is unprepared for warfare and death. Every person early on in the film that gets close to Lawrence ends up dead as a direct or indirect result of him. This completely changes him which manifests itself in his bloodthirsty battle cry towards the end of the film. His desire for glory (seemingly) is reminiscent of ancient myths where immortality extends to those that prove themselves on the battlefield and gain fame from it. Eventually, he realizes the terror he has become and that his power is limited. Some of this occurs when he realizes he was betrayed by his own people, leaving him empty.Lawrence ends the war in the Arabian lands a broken man emotionally. He has no people, no land, no country. He is a hero, but internally he appears to believe is unworthy because of this transformation. His ego and desire for power destroyed his character and integrity...as Alec Guinness said ""With Major Lawrence, mercy is a passion. With me, it is merely good manners. You may judge which motive is the more reliable."" We find that good manners may last, while passions change.Note: In my opinion, all of these changes are evident before Lawrence's torture at Deraa",Lawrence of Arabia
604,akim1-1,Torture/Rape sequence,10,17 August 2004,"Lawrence of Arabia is probably my all time favorite film. Right now I'm right on the cusp of finishing Seven Pillars of Wisdom written by the historical Lawrence. What I found interesting in the film was the scene in which Lawrence is captured by the Turks and whipped for punching the Officer. But in the book, Seven Pillars, the officer actually captured Lawrence in order to solicit him for sex, whereupon Lawrence kicked the officer in the groin. The enraged officer then has Lawrence whipped for not pleasuring him, and proceeds to have sex with a Turkish sergeant. I found the contrast between book and movie interesting, but rather necessary for the generic film audience of 1962.",Lawrence of Arabia

But the editing of this film is sloppy, and it could be tightened into a two hour and forty five minute to three hour movie. It drags in certain parts, shots are held too long. The character development is obviously the most extraordinary part of this film, watching you feel like you are getting to know Lawrence as if you are actually with him. However, despite the fact it is a classic, which no one argues, with great acting and wonderful cinematography, I think that older people glamorize some of the negatives of movies like this while not giving newer movies their due credit. The editing techniques that have been developed in the last twenty years are masterful and astonishing, and while some of these techniques have their roots in older masters like Eisenstein their originality and style are all their own. I am tired of hearing that everything is a copy of this or a knock off of that. While all film is influence by other film (simply because directors emulate those they admire) each director new and old (of consequence) adds a personal flair that cant be considered a ""copy"".

607,MrShedney,Luminous,10,29 September 2004,"Was ever an actor more happily cast than Peter O'Toole as Lawrence? He seems to give off light, a neurotic angel swept by desert winds to glories he half-loves, half-despises. He's perfect as Lawrence, or rather one of many Lawrences - the mythic creature of Lean's imagination, perhaps as valid as a dozen other personas crafted in the web of T.E.'s tortuous self-recreation. (Incidentally, for a facial resemblance, compare T.E. with Stan Laurel.) Every line of dialogue is at least interesting, and often beautiful, in itself, but almost every line echoes, resonates, elsewhere in the film, or in our memories of Biblical, legendary and desert things. Beautiful, delicate, glittering, harsh - many truths can be told, and this lyrical vision adds colour to more prosaic accounts of the forging of the modern Middle East.",Lawrence of Arabia
608,maxminimus,WW I Intelligence Officer attempts to unite Arab World,10,7 October 2005,"This film, which tells the story of T.E. Lawrence ('Seven Pillars of Wisdom') is a true classic of film making, especially in the magnificent blending of music and cinematography. The film tells the story of Lawrence's unsuccessful attempt to unite the Arab world according to his belief in the majesty of Arab civilization. One of the most memorable scenes in the film is also the goriest. It deals with the attack on a train full of wounded soldiers and has to be seen to be appreciated. The performances by Peter O'Toole and Alec Guinness are outstanding and the film contains many stellar examples of cinematography, most of which are stunning desert scenes. Lawrence of Arabia should definitely be on every movie buff's list of 'must sees'.",Lawrence of Arabia
609,dendodd,If you can find it on the big screen - that's the way to see it!,10,3 November 2004,"This film should be viewed in a big cinema on a big screen. That really is the only way to truly ""feel"" the desert scenes in this film beautifully photographed by Fred A. Young.This film has influenced so many - Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, etc., etc., but most of all film restorer Robert A. Harris. Mr. Harris along with Jim Painten, brought the film back to life with the magnificent 1989 restoration and director's cut watched over by Sir David Lean and Anne V. Coates, the film's original editor. It is a MUST for all film buffs.Although the film is over 40 years old, being a period piece it doesn't date. The film re-creates the stiff formality of the British Military of the First World War very nicely bringing to life the pompousness of General Murray, a type not likely to be encountered by today's generation. The odd quirkiness of Lawrence and his many hang-ups are depicted as only O'Toole could have created the character. The DVD is pretty crisp and clear infrequently revealing the age of the celluloid. It is very exciting but no television can match the awesome landscape created in a large format cinema equipped with real 70 mm projectors. If you have the chance, see it there first (and often, if possible).",Lawrence of Arabia
610,foovian,Lies,1,23 December 2004,"No real spoiler here beyond the simple fact that the whole movie is more or less a lie. Yes, the Arab revolt did happen, but most of the movie is complete fabrication or distortion of historical fact.A magnificent distortion of fact, yes, but a distortion nonetheless. T.E. Lawrence was a bigger man than O'Toole was equipped to portray. He wasn't some gut-wrenched drama queen who was magically able to walk from his Western ways into Arabic garb. The true story is a lot more believable and, at the same time, bigger than Messieurs Spiegel and Lean could have put on the screen.Check out any book on this topic, and you won't be able to look at the movie without laughing or crying at the absurdity of this ""historical"" drama. ""The book is better than the movie"" is a common and, by now, trite complaint, but ""Lawrence of Arabia"" commits an altogether different crime of making people believe things about T.E. Lawrence that were simply not true in the least.",Lawrence of Arabia
611,hardy-r,The most beautiful film I've ever seen,10,28 May 2006,"When I first saw Lawrence of Arabia, I was 16 and my teacher had loaned it to me as he suspected that I might enjoy it, much unlike students in his previous classes. I actually expected the film to be an incredibly boring four hours in the desert, but my opinion had changed almost as quickly as the movie had started. I was amazed by the characters, the graceful and witty dialog, the never-ending presentation of amazing shots, and of course, the character of T.E. Lawrence.To understand that a film crew had to go out there and film rare and beautiful desert phenomena, without the aid of modern visual effects technology or even a SINGLE matte painting presented an incredible feeling. Before watching this film, I was under the impression that beauty was better recreated in artifice than actually filmed. I thought that only the skill of a matte painter could produce such beauty. No. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the desert, by the magnificent and colossal natural structures in Wadi Rum and the seemingly infinite vacuous space covering the land. It was difficult to believe that there are actual places on earth like these.Second, the script was brilliant. I had a bit of trouble following the plot, but it mattered not; I was too busy admiring the visuals and the almost poetic dialog. On my second viewing, I had no trouble understanding the plot.In short, this is perhaps the most beautiful film I've ever seen.Though, I must warn: The movie is heavily fictionalized. The historical inaccuracies are numerous, however they don't take away from the film at all.In fact, not long after purchasing the film for myself, I've done quite a bit of reading about the Arab Revolt, T.E. Lawrence, and the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.",Lawrence of Arabia

A movie that moves the soul, both with sound and vision. A superb cast of actors, a moment in time we are fortunate to have forever. I knew nothing of homosexuality when I was 11, but I did understand love, perhaps this movie helped me become a little more tolerant.

614,ceaths2010,God of the Sands,9,27 September 2013,"The movie Lawrence of Arabia is about the Arabian tribes during the First World War as they try to reconquer land from the Turkish army. The story starts as the Arab soldiers lead by Prince Faisal retreat from Turkish forces. After the attack, a British officer decided that a group of the soldiers will travel through the Nefud desert and join forces with the Howeitat tribe in order to attack the Turkish base at Aqaba. When they capture the base, they move higher north towards Damascus, along the way sabotaging Turkish railways. They reach the capital before the British are able to take it themselves. But in the end the Arabs leave most city under British control.Although the war between the Arabs and the Turks is a major part of this film, David Lean tries to focus on the British officer T.E. Lawrence. David shows how Lawrence's character changes throughout the movie. At first he depicts him as a high spirited map painter with a curiosity for the desert. As he enters the tribes, he adopts the idea that the Arabs should rule their own country. But the further Lawrence goes into battle his attitude become more aggressive and blood thirsty. In the end he finally leaves the desert all together and heads back to Britain.One of the things that I find interesting in this movie is how in some scenes the view is drawn back, taking the viewer out of the main characters and allowing us to see the full scene as it passes through. There are many examples of this throughout the film. The first one being the entrance of Sheriff Ali to the well as he kills Lawrence's guide. It shows that while the desert is a vast and desolate place there are still feuds between the few people that live there. There is also another scene where the soldiers and Lawrence travel through the Nefud desert. Allowing us to see that the only thing besides the soldiers are there camels and the scorching sun pounding down upon them.",Lawrence of Arabia
615,christopherkwan,It was worth watching...,5,23 February 2005,"T.E. Lawrence was a lieutenant serving in Cairo for the British army. He was transfered to the Middle East during the World War I, because Britain wanted to ally with Arabia to against Turkey. Being sent to Saudi Arabia, he met Prince Feisal, a tribe leader of Mecca. Feisal let him lead fifty men across the Nefud desert to perform his mission - taking Aqaba from the Turk's hands. On the way through, he united the two rival Arab factions of Prince Feisal(The Hariths) and Auda abu Tayi(The Howeitats). After successfully completing his mission, he became a Major in the army and continued to secure Arab co-operation with Britain by stopping the Turks from gaining the control of Suez Canal. While on a spying mission in Derra, Lawrence was caught and tortured by a Turkish officer. He was depressed and wanted to resign. Finally he changed his mind because he thought he should give freedom to his Arab friends. He conquered Damascus and united the nations under the Arabs. As a colonel, he set up the Arab Council at Damascus for Prince Feisel, and he eventually went home after he had dome all the jobs in Arabia. He died in the spring of 1935, while he was riding a motor-cycle powerful enough to fulfill his appetite for speed.Perhaps this is longest movie I have ever watched. Although it made me sit for three and a half hours long, I still found that it was worth watching. Firstly, it is because of the scenes. The real scenes of deserts were captured gloriously and incredibly. I felt like I was standing in the middle of desert when I looked into the screen. It was so boundless, but inanimate. It was too hot to walk hen the sun started to rise, and it was so deadly when the sun set. I could feel the thirst of water under the boiling sun. Secondly, I think the music was fantastic. The melody exactly matched the theme of the story of a hero. At the same time, it told the cruelty of mankind. Thirdly, I admired the main character. Lawrence was a really tough man in my opinion, He was brave enough to go into the desert which most British soldiers were afraid. He made confused decisions, for example he rescued Gasim in the desert, but he executed him when he committed murder. He fought and attacked cruelly, but he loved his friends deeply. He was an extraordinary person who learned quickly and served faithfully.",Lawrence of Arabia

I had invested so much time into this, I refused to not see how it ended. The movie sets it up so that within the first hour you know that every little tiny detail of the movie will take thirty minutes to tell, so you expect a little more to the ending then our supposed hero ( but in reality a child trying to prove a point no one really gets) just riding off in the dust to go home escorted by a badly accented driver. That was all. Lawrence giggling like an idiot and prancing like a fairy in his new Arab clothes, what fun! What a movie! By the end of the first hour you really end up wondering what the hell they are going to do for the next two hours. You soon discover that it's not much.

628,uchropia,"very good, not great",7,1 January 2006,"Lawrence of Arabia was a bit spotty, IMO. There obviously were brilliant and gorgeous elements but there were those that prohibited me from being completely won over as well. Some of the latter were idiosyncrasies of many movies from that era, therefore, I tried to keep those in perspective. After the music, which was at odds with the movie and which I tolerated only so long before skipping, the early scenes were witty, absorbing and charming and everything I love about older films (especially the magnificently droll, British ones) as were many subsequent scenes. But as I grew knee deep in suspension of disbelief I found myself questioning the director. Not necessarily the people Lawrence happens upon in the desert but the way he happens upon them, the anachronistic and totally miscast Anthony Quinn (who can be such a hack and was in this movie - IMO), etc... all contributed to me finding the movie a bit too inconsistent to be considered great. It lacked a degree of internal logic. I also must admit to a prejudice against the residual self-conscious mannerism from stage and silent film that some early performers exhibited in dramatic roles. O'Toole's operatic manner toward the end made me ever conscious that he was acting and not going mad. It's like watching Parsifal. Omar Sharif, on the other hand, was BRILLIANT. His entire performance was flawless.I do believe the way Lawrence was portrayed with the two boys was a hint that he was suspected of being gay. I kept thinking of Batman and Robin and all the adolescent sidekicks superheroes have. I did not go into this movie with any preconceptions and don't think the thoughts these scenes evoked was arbitrary.Oh, and the voice Alec Guinness used for the prince was goofy, almost like a Peter Sellers spoof.All in all it was a very good movie but not a great one.",Lawrence of Arabia
