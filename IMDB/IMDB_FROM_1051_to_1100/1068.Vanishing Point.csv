0,Leofwine_draca,Solid car chase movie,6,17 January 2014,"VANISHING POINT is a mix of the classic car chase film and a more existential movie along the lines of EASY RIDER; the good news is that it's substantially better than EASY RIDER, and has a sheen of quality lacking in the more crowd-pleasing car flicks of the 1970s (like GONE IN 60 SECONDS and SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT).Barry Newman, playing it understated, is the driver who's tasked with delivering a car cross country under a strict time limit. Before long, the cops are on his tail for speeding, and what follows is an intense pursuit flick with some great filming of high speed chases. VANISHING POINT is a film that's all about the visual, and it does look lovely, the director capturing the sleekness of the vehicles and by contrast the wildness of the desert locales very well.And, of course, there's THAT ending, which is unforgettable once seen, and helps to add immeasurably to the experience. I think the story as a whole could have been a little more powerful - it's very slim, and there's barely any characterisation - but this is a classic production far above more recent Hollywood stabs at the genre (like DRIVE ANGRY).",Vanishing Point
1,SnoopyStyle,car chases galore,6,3 June 2019,"Former stock car driver, heroic military vet, and ex-police officer Kowalski delivers cars across the country. He's driving a white Dodge Challenger to San Francisco on little rest and drugs to stay awake. He has a run-in with a couple of motorcycle cops which sets off a dragnet by Colorado State police. Blind radio DJ Super Soul (Cleavon Little) follows the chase listening to police radio.This is only about the car chases. The characters aren't that engaging. Barry Newman needs something more. He doesn't have the darkness or the leading man charisma. The story needs tightening. Kowalski needs a consistent foil right from the start. As for the car stunts, they run off the road a lot and get plenty dusty. There is some interesting driving. They're not filmed quite at the excitement level of the iconic chase scene in its compatriot, The French Connection. One can see the evolution of the car chase but the filming style is a little static. There are a string of intriguing encounters from the snake man to the gay couple to the naked bike chick. They kept me interested despite not being that interested in the story. The chase never seems to be about anything deeper than a chase.",Vanishing Point
2,nogodnomasters,Clean as Kleenex,4,24 April 2020,"Kowalski (Barry Newman ) takes a bunch of speed and drives a Dodge Challenger recklessly from Denver to San Francisco. Apparently there is some sucker waiting for this car after it was driven at excessive speeds on back roads undergoing repairs. Generally, you drive such a car with kid gloves. Along the way, he has flashbacks to better times and endures listening to a blind DJ taking to him on the AM radio (static-free) the whole way. I would rather watch ""Smokey and the Bandit"" twice then watch this cult classic again. The ending was WTF?Guide: sex and nudity (Victoria Medlin, Gilda Texter )",Vanishing Point
3,kosmasp,There comes a point ...,9,18 April 2020,"How do you like your movies? And I stress out movies and not life. Though I reckon your view on life might make you accessible to this or make you feel quite appalled to it, depending on what you feel and think. This movie is raw, gritty and as bare boned as it gets. Nihilisitc, spiritual and quite the ride one can take with it (though I don't feel it advertises drugs - which is something others have blamed this movie for doing).How far are you willing to go and do the stunts and the free spirit win you over? The action/stunt sequences are quite something and it is not a surprise that French Connection came after this with the help of the same individual at work here. There are some cliches being used, but the ending itself is more likely to brake the movie for some. While there are inconsistencies (how much can a car survive/endure - suspension of disbelief is quite needed), the biggest might cripple it for you at the end: Why? Well why not asks the director .. and there is a thought behind how it all ends up too - like it or not, this is technically sound and as they say here: far out",Vanishing Point
4,classicsoncall,'End Speed Zone',7,4 June 2009,"There might have been a point (like back in the early Seventies when this film came out) when I would have considered a picture like this a monumental waste of time. I was merely twenty then, and the idea of racing across the countryside didn't present to me the kind of thing that would be worth doing, never mind watching it take place on a movie screen for an hour and a half. But just like a lot of films, this isn't so much about what's happening on screen as much as it is about what's happening inside the head of it's protagonist. Barry Newman's Kowalski wasn't a loser, he had been a part of civil society for about as long as forging a career made any sense at all. However when events in his life began to blur the edges of sanity, he decided to reverse course and turn completely the other way.Equating speed with freedom of the soul, and with a sense of the blind leading the blind (Cleavon Little as 'Super Soul'), ""Vanishing Point"" does make IT's point - a life half realized isn't worth living at all. All metaphorical of course, as suicide does have a way of removing any other options, but still, the message is in choosing how one will live. Grittily explored here with stark desert landscapes, red-neck racists and unimaginable delights riding in on a motorcycle, one can't help re-evaluating this message flick from almost forty years ago for what it's worth, a rebellious slap in the face of conformity.",Vanishing Point
5,jboothmillard,Vanishing Point,5,30 October 2017,"I had heard this movie title a number of times, reading a little into it I knew it was something to do with driving, and I had it recorded on VHS for a long time, so I finally got to watching it eventually. Basically Kowalski (Barry Newman) is a former racing driver, ex-cop and Medal of Honor Vietnam War veteran, he now works as a car delivery driver. His latest assignment is to deliver a white 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T 440 Magnum, from Denver to San Francisco, approximately 1,200 miles, in 3 days. The delivery service clerk, Sandy (Karl Swenson), urges him to get some rest, but Kowalski insists on getting started, then he has a bet with his dealer, Jake (Lee Weaver), to get the car there in less than 15 hours. Kowalski is haunted by the memories of the Vietnam war, his discharge from the police in retaliation for preventing his partner from raping a young woman, and the death of his girlfriend Vera Thornton (Victoria Medlin), he now exists on adrenaline. Driving west across Colorado, two motorcycle police officers pursue Kowalski who try to stop him for speeding, with his experience as a motorcycle racer he manages to force one off the road and eludes the other. Then a driver in a Jaguar E-Type convertible pulls up alongside Kowalski, challenging him to race, the after accepting the driver nearly runs him off the road, but Kowalski overtakes him and causes the Jaguar to crash into a river, Kowalski checks to see if the driver is okay, before taking off. The police are in hot pursuit, but are unable to catch him as Kowalski drives across Utah and into Nevada, during the pursuit he listens to hippie radio station KOW, broadcasting from Goldfield, Nevada. The show is hosted by the blind disc jockey who goes by the name Super Soul (Blazing Saddles' Cleavon Little), he listens to the police radio frequency, he encourages Kowalski to evade the police. Super Soul seems to understand Kowalski and seems to see and hear Kowalski's reactions, he calls him ""the last American hero"", Kowalski gains the interest of the news media, and people gather at the KOW studio to offer their support. Kowalski finds himself surrounded as the police chase him across Nevada, he heads into the desert, he blows the left front tire, an old Prospector (Dean Jagger), who catches snakes, helps him, gives him fuel and redirects him back to the highway. On the way Kowalski picks up two homosexual hitchhikers stranded en route to San Francisco, they are ""Just Married"", they attempt to hold him at gunpoint, but he manages to throw them out and continue his journey. On Saturday afternoon, a vengeful off-duty highway patrolman and some local racist thugs break into the KOW studio and assault Super Soul and his engineer. Approaching the California state line, hippie biker Angel (Timothy Scott) helps Kowalski, he gives him some pills to help him stay awake, Angel's girlfriend (Gilda Texter), who rides her motorcycle nude, recognises Kowalski from the various newspaper articles. Kowalski suspects that Super Soul's broadcast has been infiltrated by the police to entrap him, Angel confirms they are indeed waiting at the border, he helps Kowalski get through the roadblock. Kowalski finally reaches California by Saturday, he calls Jake the dealer from a payphone to reassure him that he still intends to deliver the car on Monday. On Sunday morning, California police have been tracking Kowalski's movements on an electronic wall-map, a roadblock using two bulldozers has been set up in the small town of Cisco, where Kowalski will be passing, a small crowd gathers there. Kowalski approaches the roadblock at high speed, he smiles as he crashes into the bulldozers in a fiery explosion, killing himself, firemen work on putting out the flames, and the crowd slowly disperses. Also starring Paul Koslo as Deputy Charlie Scott and Robert Donner as Deputy Collins. Newman is charismatic enough as the man on a drug-fuelled trip, and Little is good as the DJ who charts the anti- hero's progress, it is a simple story of a driven driver going at high speed through deserts and small towns, stopping only for fuel and rest, so there is plenty of interesting scenery along the way, a reasonable cult road movie. Worth watching!",Vanishing Point
6,Woodyanders,Almost lives up to its killer cult reputation,8,22 May 2006,"One of the all-time big deal early 70's youth cult movies, a fairly obvious, but extremely potent ""Easy Rider"" spin-off which combines the once popular, now hopelessly passé profound existential road movie parable exploring the slowly waning late 60's hippie counterculture with the terse and more straightforward chase thriller. The net result of this unusual and intriguing mixture is a generally up to par picture which for the most part lives up to its killer cult reputation.Barry Newman, all tense, tautly coiled, tight-lipped intensity and sullenly brooding attitude, gives a solid, compelling performance as Kowalski, a dour, taciturn, refractory former cop, onetime race car driver and Vietnam vet who's become a bitter, speed pill-popping nonconformist societal drop-out. Kowalski makes a bet with his bennie connection that he can drive a souped-up Dodge Challenger from Denver, Colorado to San Francisco, California in a mere fifteen hours. Kowalski tears his bound and determined way towards his targeted destination, incurring the spiteful wrath of the police in three states in the process. The pigs give dogged chase. Ultra-cool, jive-talking, rhythm and blues loving blind black disc jockey Super Soul ( a perfectly funky, shoot-the-fireworks hysterical slice of fat, juicy, scenery-scarfing ham from Cleavon Little) finds out about Kowalski and decides to help out, declaring that Kowalski represents the ""last beautiful free soul on this planet"" and subsequently making him a much admired countercultural celebrity.Director Richard Sarafian keeps this quickly paced, handsomely made oddball film nicely humming throughout, occasionally pausing for some curious flashbacks into Kowalski's troubled past (one entailing Kowalski's beachside romance with his old lady, complete with crashing waves and hideously cloying orchestral music, is embarrassingly atrocious). Alas, the dialogue tends to be horribly affected and thus hard on the ears (""speed means freedom of the soul"") and the extraneous, often disruptive flashbacks only clutter up an otherwise compact and gripping narrative. Furthermore, the insights into Kowalski's past prevent ""Vanishing Point"" from becoming more challenging and philosophical; they ground Kowalski too much in drab everyday reality -- he would have been a more effective ""*beep* the system"" anti-hero if his motives had remained obscure. Still, there's plenty of good stuff to be found and enjoyed here: a terrific rock score (the winsome flower child folk-pop duo Delaney and Bonnie, with a pig-tailed Rita Coolidge supplying background vocals, make a brief on-screen appearance while the songs themselves were written by such diverse artists as Jerry Reed and Kim Carnes), beautifully dusty and desolate desert locations, several seriously smoking car chase scenes, a suitably gritty, rough-edged look, a truly startling and quintessentially 70's uncompromising downbeat ending, and exquisite panoramic cinematography by John A. Alonzo (the grand sweeping crane pans and breathtaking overhead helicopter shots are quite sumptuous). Appearing in nifty small roles are Paul Koslo and Robert Donner as two of Kowalski's fuzzball pursuers, John Amos as Super Soul's assistant, perennial bad guy Anthony James as a slimy, effeminate homosexual highway bandit, the ever-quirky and delightful Severn Darden as a smug, phony roadside preacher, the lovely, willowy Gilda Texter in the totally ridiculous role of a cute blonde motorcycle mama who rides around the hot, sweltering desert completely naked on a motorcycle (!), and, in an especially fine, colorful bit, veteran character actor Dean Jagger as a cagey, crusty old desert rat who collects rattlesnakes. All in all, a pretty flawed, but still worthwhile flick which deserves its fervent fan following.",Vanishing Point
7,Tweekums,Can Kowalski drive from Denver to San Francisco in fifteen hours?,8,6 October 2019,"In the past Kowalski was a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, a police officer and a race car driver; now he delivers cars. His latest job is to deliver a Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco. He has plenty of time to do it but makes a bat that he can get there in fifteen hours. As he speeds across the American west he quickly attracts the attention of the police who pursue him from state to state. He also comes to the attention of the media; in particular blind DJ 'Super Soul' who reports on the chase and seems to almost have a connection to Kowalski. Along the way Kowalski meets a variety of people; a man determined to race him, two men who try to rob him, an old snake catcher and a naked woman on a motorbike. He never stops for long on his journey west.I liked the fact that the plot is so simple; our protagonist has no real need to drive as fast as he does; he does so because he wants to. His wager just a bit of fun not for a vast amount. Similarly the more we learn about Kowalski the more of an unlikely rebel he seems... which of course makes the character more interesting. The only laws he appears to break as relatively minor; speeding, leaving the scenes of accidents (but not before seeing nobody was seriously hurt), and the use of amphetamines to keep him awake. The journey is effectively one long car chase with the pursuers changing as he crosses state lines. The scenery changes as he goes but it is always fairly open in areas where few people live. It is filmed in a way that makes the land seem like another character. Barry Newman does a great job in the role of Kowalski; not because he plays him as a larger than life character but precisely the opposite; it is a very natural performance. Cleavon Little is fun as Super Soul. The rest of the cast are solid; even the somewhat bored looking people in crowd scenes seem right for the film. Overall I'd say this is one to watch if you enjoy watching cars chase across an open landscape.",Vanishing Point
8,BA_Harrison,Not the ultimate car chase movie.,4,26 May 2018,"Kowalski (Barry Newman) is a speed freak in more ways than one, popping uppers so that he drive 24/7, having bet his drug dealer that he can deliver a supercharged car to California in record time; in doing so, he becomes a wanted man by the police.The car chase is a staple of the action movie genre, but Vanishing Point, by director Richard C. Sarafian, IS a car chase - the whole damn thing! As such, the plot is virtually non-existant, the film largely reliant on the vehicular action which sadly isn't jaw-dropping enough to sustain interest for almost 100 minutes.Being a product of the hippie generation, the whole thing is given a pseudomythological, existentialist vibe, in which driver Kowalski is elevated to legendary anti-hero status by DJ Super Soul (Cleavon Little), and there are plenty of off-beat characters along the way, all of which has secured the film a cult following, but I found the whole thing highly over-rated and ultimately pretty boring.On a more positive note, the cinematography is great, while the mythical road warrior angle and much of the shots seem to have influenced George Miller's Mad Max movies (leading to Fury Road, which for me, is the ultimate car-chase movie).",Vanishing Point
9,Quinoa1984,"cool car chase picture, but more existential than you'd think",7,4 November 2007,"My impression going into Vanishing Point was that of a road-exploitation picture of the period. And thanks to movie-geek Tarantino Death Proof hyped up by having a kind of image-placement (ala yellow jump-suit in Kill Bill) that superimposed for those who hadn't seen it a sort of expectation. While I didn't quite get the mother of all car-crash pictures- there are a few, don't get it wrong- it is a pretty interesting work of its times. It doesn't get nearly deep enough with its main character as some symbolic point of a fall from grace from authority or of disillusionment with the period, but it's somehow still a cool little movie. There's a feeling that something is going on underneath, the subtext to the whole facet of speed that a person takes (uppers) going along with a kind of car ride that Dr. Gonzo would probably not attempt. At the same time Barry Newman fills in the role as enigmatically as possible; we're never totally sure what this guy's motive is to go for broke in delivering a car across states to a little s***-hole town at 100 miles an hour, which makes it part of the fun.It's a high-stakes story of daring cop-chases, detour through a desert, help from strangers, and a fatalistic ending that seems more bizarre and shocking than that of an Easy Rider. Not to say much for plot, though the writers do inject a strange co-plot (not quite sub-plot exactly) with a blind disc jockey, played by a spot-on Cleavon Little, who keeps tabs with Kowalsky as if he were an angel on his shoulder. The director also fashions out with a superb DP (who also worked on Chinatown) a good way making things not ever go too lighting paced or frenetic, but giving some level of breathing room of the open spaces, the long stretches of road, the desert, the rural towns, even Kowalski's face. And the sort of straightforward-but-not attitude to Kowalski's mission, in light of his history, adds to the thrills.If it's only a little disappointing it's that it hasn't aged as well as it should've. Maybe it's not exactly a fault- it's proud to be in the 70s, with moments of grass and that naked woman on the bicycle as indicators of a 'far-out' period- but, for example, should the rock and roll not always be a consistent point with the scenes? Some songs do stand out, and at times it's toe-tapping even, but not many. And the suddenness of the ending marks as almost a cop-out; it's just too easy a way to end the flick when it feels like a bigger climax awaits. Vanishing Point doesn't have dynamite storytelling, but it does have a dynamite attitude, positioning itself in the frame of a B-movie to make its mark with a terrific car and a bad-ass behind the wheel.",Vanishing Point
10,Coventry,They say it's the ultimate car chasing movie... They are RIGHT!,9,13 November 2007,"Kowalski's the name First, last and only. He's the silent 'Last American' anti-hero who makes up in charisma what he lacks in communicative skills. Kowalski works as a delivery driver and has to transport a car, the notoriously far-out cool white 1970 Dodge Challenger, from Denver to San Francisco. To make life somewhat more exciting and ""challenging"", he makes a bet with his local speed-supplier and claims to be able to complete the trip within 15 hours of time. Suffice to say winning this bet will require a lot of exceeding the speed limits, taking impressive shortcuts through the Nevada desert and pulling spectacular car stunts. It doesn't take too long before our hero Kowalski is chased by the highway patrol troops of no less than three states, but simultaneously he encounters a handful of people that support his ""freedom"" mission, like the blind radio DJ Super Soul and a couple of amiable (and naked) hippies. ""Vanishing Point"" was on my personal must-see list since several years already, but watching QT's ""Death Proof"" recently accelerated my purchase. That movie truly glorifies this archetypical 70's cult-treasure, and with good reason! ""Vanishing Point"" contains some of the most exhilarating chase-sequences ever captured on film (and they're purely old-fashioned stunt work, no dreadful computer animation), John A. Alonzo's exterior photography is sublime, the soundtrack is stimulating, all characters are intriguing and worth exploring and – like no other contemporary achievement – the film breathes the rebellious atmosphere of the early 70's. Quite a lot of people claim that ""Vanishing Point"", albeit being an entertaining picture, hasn't got much of a plot. Well, I beg to differ, as Kowalski's journey is much more meaningful and his character much more engaging than superficially appears. The further his Dodge takes him (* extra spoiler warning *), the more you begin to realize Kowalski is an embittered person and his silly bet might even by an easy excuse to cover up a grotesque suicide attempt. Multiple flashbacks enlighten us regarding Kowalski's past: he was sent on a tour of Duty in 'Nam, he failed as a police officer because he was too honest, he lost a girlfriend in a surfing accident and survived a couple of harsh crashes on racing circuits. He definitely isn't an empty-headed macho prick in an astonishingly awesome car, but a true cult-movie anti hero. ""Vanishing Point"" righteously ranks among the greatest cult movies ever made and it's one of those cases where you really want to BE the lead character. If I'd be struggling through a midlife-crisis right now, I'd go out and buy myself a genuine Dodge Challenger.",Vanishing Point
11,hitchcockthelegend,The last American hero to whom speed means freedom of the soul.,8,2 June 2019,"Vanishing Point is directed by Richard Sarafian and written by Guillermo Cain. It stars Barry Newman, Cleavon Little and Dean. Jagger.Car delivery driver Kowalski (Newman) tasks himself to get a Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco in a seemingly impossible time. His journey will see him constantly pursued by the police and come into contact with a number of interesting characters.By definition a cult film, Vanishing Point baffled many a critic upon its release but continues to gain fans as each decade passes. It operates out of the counterculture sphere of film making that surfaced in the late 60s and early 70s. On the surface it's a very simple picture, the speedster aspect of the car chases appear to render it as purely a car junkie thrill piece. Yet much conjecture and analysis has occurred over the years to give it mythical status, with some maintaining it's a masterpiece of a message movie. It certainly has an ethereal quality about it, to the point where those invested in more than just the brilliant car stunts et al will find themselves beguiled by Sarafian's tantalising piece.Kowalski doesn't say much, even as he meets odd people and ends up in odd situations, this positions him as a true cinematic anti hero. His backstory is revealed to us in flashbacks, so we do get to know about him, understand where his skills came from and why his psychological make up is the way it is. His contact with the real world as it were, is via a blind radio DJ known as Super Soul (Cleavon Little excellent), who Sarafian has smartly put up as an almost physic companion during Kowalski's journey, with him crucially warning of policeman perils. It's one of a number of intriguing shards in a fascinating movie. The makers have remained vague as to exactly what everything in the film means, which is fine, for this is a picture that each individual viewer should decipher as they see fit.More than just a thrilling car chase movie? You bet. 8/10",Vanishing Point
12,Scarecrow-88,The Vanishing Point,10,28 December 2006,"You know I can not really answer the question that is posed to cross-country car deliverer, Kowalski(Barry Newman)towards the end of the film by a man he made a daring, ridiculous bet with stating he could take a car from Colorado to California in 15 hours, but there's no doubt in my mind, he knew the answer as he drives his car into certain death in the final climactic scene. You might wish to wring my neck for just tossing the climax to you in such a forward way, but I don't think most viewers will expect Kowalski to make that deadline after committing the felonies he breaks along the way. There's a look on Kowalski's face that shows peace with this smile of almost gratitude for having made his long journey. Or, at least that's the way I gaged his reaction at the end as he knew his time was up.The question is..Why even bother trying to make an exhausting trip so far in such a short time to begin with? I have my opinion as I'm sure others do. Perhaps, the film offers to each individual a chance to make their own mind up regarding why our hero decides he must try and achieve the impossible task he sets out for. I felt it was a way of proving to himself he could achieve something to fulfill an unsatisfied existence that has been, for the most part(I'm speaking in regards to the flashback sequences offered us sprinkled throughout the film), full of tragedy and sadness. I think the film appears at the start to be just a racing-against-time chase film with cops in hot pursuit, but it takes on a greater meaning to me anyways. Cleavon Little has an interesting role as Super Soul(an interesting name, isn't it?). He's a deejay who almost becomes K's spiritual guide along the way. K represents something to different people. Some look at him as the ""last American dream"", others as nutty as a fruitcake. I think he's only on this journey for himself--this calm exterior hides loneliness I think and loss(the young lover who dies in a surfing mishap;seeing a young druggie almost raped by a cop-partner he had on the force). I think the loneliness part is briefly fulfilled by Charlotte Rampling's mysterious hitchhiker(her scenes were cut in the American version, but I watched the European one)towards the end.I love the film for what it shows..the American landscape allowing a car and it's driver room to navigate and live. In the time-span available, K does just that.",Vanishing Point

14,zardoz-13,Kowalski's Last Ride,8,16 June 2012,"Director Richard C. Sarafian's rampaging road epic ""Vanishing Point"" qualifies as one of the seminal counterculture melodramas of the early 1970s. This careening car chase between a car delivery driver in a creamy white Dodge Challenger and the authorities in three states constitutes an existential commentary about race relations, morality, and freedom. ""Vanishing Point"" amounts to ""Easy Rider"" on four wheels. Basically, Kowalski makes a wager with his African-American speed dealer that he can take a car from Denver, Colorado, to San Francisco, California, in 15 hours. This deceptively simple saga scrutinizes the life of our hero in flashback as he sets out to deliver a car and emerges as a media superstar before he dies in an explosive crash in the middle of nowhere. Between the time that he shows up to take delivery of the Challenger and he dies on the symbolic horns of two earth-moving bulldozers, Kowalski emerges as a patron saint of lost causes. He served in the U.S. Army, fought in Vietnam, and received a Medal of Honor. After the war, he became a cop, witnessed corruption first-hand, and got drummed out of the ranks because he refused to countenance corruption. He channeled his energies into racing motorcycles and automobiles until he took up delivering car and crunching on speed. Barry Newman plays Kowalski as a sympathetic but enigmatic character who refuses to take advantage of anybody, especially nubile women who throw themselves at him and offer him the both sex and drugs. He attracts all kinds of folks to his cause. An African-American radio disc jockey named 'Super Soul' at a remote radio station with call letters that could be interpreted as an abbreviation of its last name, free-spirited hippies with ample supplies of narcotics, and elderly adventurers flock to his side in supreme defiance of the law. Kowalski has a polarizing effect on the law. The good authorities realize that they can only cite him for recklessness driver. When they try to persuade two homosexuals who tried to rob him to swear out complaints against him, they refuse. Sarafian has called ""Vanishing Point"" a western about a lone rider, a champion of justice who refuses to knuckle under to an oppressive regime, literally a man heading west. Sarafian stages the story out in the wide open spaces of the sprawling American southwest and tells the story in flashbacks when our hero isn't barreling down one road or another, evening in the middle of the desert with cops on bikes, prowl cars, and helicopters in fast pursuit. Clearly, ""Vanishing Point"" provided the inspiration for ""Two-Lane Blacktop,"" ""The Sugarland Express,"" and ""Smoky and the Bandit."" What it lacks in depth, it makes up for with adrenaline.",Vanishing Point
15,grantss,"Great anti-authoritarian, pro-freedom movie",9,3 November 2014,"Very good, and surprisingly so. I only watched this because it gets many reverential references in Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". Expected it to be nothing more than a revhead movie, but it is far better than that.More like Easy Rider on four wheels. A movie about freedom and individuality. Good script, but it is the direction and the setting that makes this movie great. Richard Sarafian sketches Kowalski's character through flashbacks and delivered information, showing you why he is doing what he is doing. The ending is perfect.Barry Newman hardly had much dialogue, but in playing Kowalski he defined anti-authoritarian freedom-loving figures forever.",Vanishing Point
16,evanston_dad,A Film That Never Sits Still,9,12 March 2009,"""Vanishing Point"" is the counter culture movie to end all counter culture movies. It's got it all -- the grizzled, moody anti-hero; the rebellion against authority; the naked hippies; the criticism of racial oppression; the bleak, ""what's the point of it all?"" existential angst. But first and foremost, ""Vanishing Point"" is one hell of a kick-ass movie.It's clear why Quentin Tarantino, an obvious cinephile, fell in love with this movie and decided to pay homage to it with his car chase film ""Death Proof."" Because ""Vanishing Point"" above all else is supremely cinematic. It's a film about movement -- our protagonist is never content to stand still, lest the demons chasing him catch up to him. And like him, the film never stands still either. It's kinetic and full of an angry and restless energy, and it's always compelling even if it doesn't always make sense.Barry Newman plays the tortured hero, Kowalski, looking like a cross between Mike Brady and Tim Roth. Cleavon Little is the blind d.j. who becomes a sort of guardian angel to Kowalski. And old-time character actor Dean Jagger has an unsettling cameo as a hermit living out in the desert wilds.Grade: A",Vanishing Point
17,AlsExGal,Mediocre counterculture film from the early 70s,5,1 August 2020,"Barry Newman drives a car from Denver to San Francisco, something that according to Google Maps should probably take about 20 hours. (The interstates are better now, but there was probably less traffic in 1971, so I'd call it a wash). However, Barry makes a bet with his amphetamine pusher that he'll make the trip in 15:30, which leads to him getting chased by the police in directions that won't get him to San Francisco. (Seriously, why does he end up in Joshua Tree National Monument?)Along the way, Barry meets a bunch of people similarly on the fringes of society like him, such as prospector Dean Jagger and two carjackers -- I'm not certain whether the two characters were actually in love with each other, or pretending to be as their MO to distract their mark. And there's a blind DJ who listens to the police radio and sends Barry messages over the AM radio.I suppose there's a story to be made about people on the edges of normal society, but this isn't it, as it's a mess both in terms of geography and in not caring about the characters.",Vanishing Point
18,Wuchakk,"Inscrutable, existential early 70's car-chase flick",6,19 July 2015,"Released in 1971, ""Vanishing Point"" stars Barry Newman as Kowalski, a pill-popping former racer and police officer, who bets that he can deliver a supercharged car from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours. The police in four states try to apprehend him as a DJ (Cleavon Little) supports him on the airwaves. Dean Jagger plays a geezer Kowalski runs into in the desert.This is a cult flick about the adventures of a rebel without a cause. While it has similarities to 1969's ""Easy Rider,"" it's not as compelling and the subtext isn't as good (see my review of ""Easy Rider"").The story is a big middle finger to what was called ""the establishment"" at a time when the Vietnam War was making a wreck of America's social cohesion. Kowalski was part of that establishment when he was a cop, but became disillusioned after he exposed corruption and was punished for it, but heralded by the counterculture. Kowalski had seen the underbelly of the ""pig"" and didn't want to be part of it. At the beginning he drives off the road and you see him looking at some derelict vehicles. He increasingly realizes HE is a derelict on the side of the road with nowhere to go. What better next stop than oblivion? The climax is his *beep* off moment to go out on HIS terms. Three years later ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"" sorta ripped it off. While that movie lacks the interesting (and ambiguous) subtext of ""Vanishing Point,"" it's a more compelling watch. Despite the many car chases, ""Vanishing Point"" is surreal and even languid, embellished by a listless score (e.g the opening) and acid rock tracks throughout; while I don't like the former, most of the latter tracks are good and fit the ambiance of the movie.Then there's the naked blond on the motorcycle sequence. Someone incredulously asked: ""How could he possibly turn down a sexy naked blonde? What's his problem?!"" I guess sexiness is in the eye of the beholder because I didn't find her all that sexy. Sure, she has a pretty face, but her body is nearly as un-curvy as a 12 year-old girl. But some guys prefer thinner women and that's cool; to each his own. In addition, Kowalski was still grieving over his true love. Moreover, the naked blond didn't play the game of seduction, which takes time and imagination. Instead she prematurely throws her entire hand on the table and it simply doesn't turn Kowalski on. Lastly, despite it being the ""free love"" era (1970), Kowalski was much older (and arguably nobler) than the average hippie; as such, he didn't feel it proper to take advantage of the mate of the guy who was selflessly helping him (at least not without his clear permission).The movie runs 99 minutes and was shot in Colorado, Utah, Nevada and Arizona.GRADE: B- COMMENTARY ON THE MEANING ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie) In an interview Barry Newman very seriously explained Kowalski's actions at the end: ""He thought he could make it through; and that was the reason for the smile just prior to the impact."" I don't question this since the actor himself would have more insights about the movie than the viewer, but even his answer is ambiguous. It could mean (and probably does) that Kowalski thought he could make it through to the other side, i.e. leave the physical plane for the spiritual one and the (possible) freedom thereof. After all, he sees ""the light"" between the blades of the bulldozers while approaching. Keep in mind that Kowalski was hopped up on a lot of drugs. As such, he doesn't commit suicide in the sense he wants to die, but rather kills himself in the accident because he BELIEVES he'll make it through; physically or spiritually, it doesn't matter. He believed.",Vanishing Point
19,The_Void,Interesting seventies cult film,6,29 April 2007,"Well, I have to admit that Vanishing Point didn't do as much for me as it evidently did for other people, but I can see why this film does have a cult following. The film is pretty much your 'classic' seventies car film, as it features plenty of car chases as well as the standard backdrop of desert and open road. The film obviously takes a lot of influence from the sixties classic Easy Rider in that we follow the fortunes of a central character that exists outside of the society norm. Kowalski is the man in question, and he is given the task of taking a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Colorado to the California. He then takes a bet that he can get the car to it's destination in just fifteen minutes. It later transpires that Kowalski is both an ace driver and wanted by the police, and soon his journey across America is being interrupted by various parties, including the cops, who seem very keen on chasing him around the country. His plight soon gets a lot of media attention, and his only allay is a blind radio DJ with a police scanner...This film wasn't really what I was expecting. I was hoping that Vanishing Point would be more comparable to seventies car flicks such as The Driver, but the film unfortunately is nowhere near that entertaining. That's not to say that Vanishing Point is by any means boring; it certainly does have a lot going for it, although I do have to say that certain parts really drag and since there aren't many characters that are easy to care for, the film becomes very easy to turn yourself off to. The style and feel of the film is it's strongest asset, and director Richard C. Sarafian does a good job of capturing the classic seventies tone. I have to say I wasn't all that impressed with the central performance from Barry Newman. The lead actor lacks charisma and since this movie isn't exactly plot heavy, that does become a problem. However, there are a lot of pluses for the film; chief among them being the car chases, which tend to be the star of any film involving cars, and this one is no different. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone; but if you're a fan of seventies cult, you might find something to like about it.",Vanishing Point
20,trashgang,pure cult,8,3 March 2015,"To be honest, I never came across this flick until a friend of my dropped in a few weeks ago telling me to see this flick if you do love muscle cars because the main lead is a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T. Do loving muscle cars I thought to give it a try but after a few minutes I knew that this was a must see.Just watch how this was shot and just listen to the music, only that makes it worth watching. The story itself isn't really that important. Bring a car from point A to B. We do learn a bit about the driver Kowalski (Barry Newman) and his past but it's really the car that makes the movie. Naturally being made early 70's it were the heydays of the muscle cars and you will see a lot of them. Maybe one reason that this flick isn't that much spoken of is the fact that it doesn't include a Ford Mustang but don't worry, the sound and power of the Dodge will deliver.What you see throughout this flick are teams that can't be done nowadays. The racism used towards the end is what really happened back then but nowadays you watch it with open mouth. But it was also the moment of the hippies and free sex and you will see nudity here and there. Naturally drugs are involved too. It will remind you of the other classic Easy Rider (1969) only here we don't have that much of deep story. It shows America as it was back then. I've seen it on restored Blu Ray and it looked stunning with excellent 5.1, you can here the car all over your room. This is pure cult and did stand time, only to wish for that those cars were still here with all their character and sound in stead of the trash being made nowadays.

The whole movie is nothing else then that. I can imagine that in 1971 this movie would have score high rankings but we are in 2016 now so I watched it with my mind being in 2016. And so my ratings are not good for Vanishing Point. I was going to score it a five, but because of the end that I didn't like it dropped a point. If you are a fan of American muscle cars, or more specifically a Dodge Challenger in this case then you might like Vanishing Point. Or if you are a fan of the music from that time then you might like it as well. But for the rest, the story is just weak and quite ridiculous. Maybe in that time the driver would not have been caught for so long, but in 2016 he would not make it for more then 50 miles. It's like the police in the seventies are retarded.

It's blissfully uncomplicated yet still exciting to see Barry Newman tearing ass through the southwest. He's not even the star of this; the real headlines here is the 1970 Dodge Challenger. And man, did they know how to make it look good. Part of the reason I so enjoy watching this is to hear the roar of that engine; and I'm not even a gearhead (hell, I wouldn't have any clue how to handle that beast). But this is one of those mutual car/film relationships you just don't see every day. OO7 had the DB5, Bullitt had the fastback, and Kowalski has that Challenger. There's something appealing about his trip across the desert; a cry for freedom, a journey without a destination. It's dated in the best sense of the word and still resonant four decades later.

23,christopher-underwood,a diminishing perspective suggesting some shimmering and elusive vanishing point.,9,27 April 2020,"Never sounded too appealing to me, a film about someone racing a car across the US. But hey, this is really something. More a product of the time than of the director, perhaps though the cinematography is stunning. From the first few static shots of a small town, the signage, the people and the sky you just know this is going to be good. And it is, sure it is basically Barry Newman racing a sleek white car across the states, except most of the hard work is done by his stunt and this is no ordinary car. Fabulous landscapes and exciting incidents abound and it is only with the appearance of Charlotte Rampling (cut from the American prints) towards the end that things turn a bit weird even mystical for the delirious ending. Rampling is great as the stoned seductress even if we are still wondering about the naked girl motorcyclist from the previous scene and special mention must go to the blind DJ who takes it upon himself to befriend the driver over the airwaves. Cleavon Little is that man and would be seen again to further great effect in Blazing Saddles a couple of years later. So breathless is the early pace that there is little chance to pause for thought but as the ending looms an opportunity for introspection arises and we are eventually left wondering if this marks the end of an American dream, that surely now lost, open road and a diminishing perspective suggesting some shimmering and elusive vanishing point.",Vanishing Point
24,siderite,"Interesting metaphor, but ultimately pretty boring to me",7,4 June 2010,"The movie is about a guy in a white car chasing through the desert parts of America while being chased by the police for speeding (or better said, not stopping for patrol cars). That's it. The scenery and the background 70's music is all that fills the movie.Of course, it is also more than that, a metaphor of a man's journey through life. The ending was at the same time as I had expected it, although I really wanted it to have more meaning. Charlotte Rampling, back then young and terribly beautiful, makes an episodic appearance as the hitchhiker that knows our hero by name and says she had been waiting for him for forever. That's his absolution, the forgiveness, the abandonment of the real world and the acceptance of self. Or at least this is how I saw it.Bottom line: if you are in a pensive mood you might appreciate both the allegory and the beautiful scenery, maybe even the hippy open road feel. Otherwise, you might be sadly disappointed. Myself, while I can't say I regret seeing ""a cult movie"", I also can't say it is a movie I really wanted to see.",Vanishing Point
25,bensonmum2,"""Hey Kowalski, you out there?""",8,17 February 2008,"Kowalski is a driver. It's all he's known whether from his former life as stock car driver or a policeman. Driving is in his blood. His new job is delivering cars across the country. His assignment is to take a Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco. And Kowalski intends to do it in record time. It's not long before Kowalski has the police from four states hot on his trail.There's really not a lot you can write about Vanishing Point without first discussing the film's finale. And, it's almost impossible to discuss the ending of Vanishing Point without giving it away. I'll try not to give too much away, but it will be difficult. Vanishing Point is as nihilistic a movie as I've seen. Why did Kowalski do what he did? And why does Kowalski even have to get to San Francisco in such a hurry? The way I see it, the two are related in Kowalski's desire for freedom. He does what he does at the end of the movie to express the ultimate freedom. Also, in Kowalski world view, driving represents freedom. He is driving from Denver to San Francisco because that's what he does  he drives. It may not be the way you or I see the world, but it's Kowalski's way. Beyond the ending, Vanishing Point is a fascinating movie. If you don't think you would find scene after scene of a 1970 Alpine White Dodge Challenger going down the highway exciting, Vanishing Point might not be a good choice for you. I'll admit, however, that once he reached the vast, limitless desert, I began to worry that I might also lose interest. But it's these seemingly endless scenes interrupted by Kowalski's flashbacks or a chance meeting with a stranger that make the ending so powerful. There's no predicting what's about to come. It's an awesome experience!",Vanishing Point
26,lost-in-limbo,You have yourself a bet.,7,4 May 2007,"Car delivery driver Kowalski is handed the job of driving a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Colorado to California, but he also accepts a bet that he'd reach his destination in no less than 15 hours. After popping some pills, the trip begins and soon enough he encounters the highway patrol after not pulling over for some motorcycle officers. Now the police are in hot pursuit for their man, but Kowalski gets help from Supersoul; a blind DJ who's using his police scanner to inform his man of what's going on and by turning this free spirit into a modern day hero. On his journey he also finds himself meeting a wide range of characters.Over-hyped or under-hyped, I'm caught in two minds. To tell the truth, I didn't mind it and it's hard to keep your eyes off it. I guess that's all that matters. Even though I still question its reputation. However this product of the times is one unusual character odyssey through America's sprawling desert backyard of friends and foes that this laconically seldom figure comes by on his simple goal from a to b. What we get is unique and fascinating escapism road dash, with it all slowly unravelling, but there's not much mystic drawn off the protagonist, because of some odd, if unfulfilled flashbacks interwoven into the minimal plot, which don't equal much and are only there to give us the usual complexities in an extended car chase. Not much is clearly explained, but we watch how he's basically a vacant shell to his life (thanks to past flashbacks we know what triggers it) and surroundings, well that's up until this speeding journey, which triggers a mind-set that this might be a good way to go out. Of course, it's all about your interpretation of what's unfolding. On the other hand looking too deep within it, might just show-up how silly the whole thing is. I guess that depends what you're looking for. Dialogue is pretty light-weight and sparse. Really, it's director Michael Pearson's stylishly credible and dazzlingly gravel-charged car chase scenes that makes it a real hoot and it's backed up by John Alonzo's crisply, all-embracing scenic photography of the fetching locations and authentically gritty action. Pearson's direction holds a neat rhythm to it, but he can get spontaneously creative when he uses camera angles and a spiced-up, soul-filled soundtrack to depict and balance out the right tone and feel. The blood does get a good workout. When this begins, something is always happening (plenty of separate episodes make up the narrative) and it doesn't take too long to get into it. The performances are particularly sound with most of the interesting arising from the lesser support roles. Barry Newman's gives a acceptably moody lead performance as Kowalski. He doesn't shine, but it's workable. Cleavon Little's energy-delivered turn as DJ Supersoul is a nice touch and he could have been seen as some sort of guardian angel looking over him or maybe a voice in Kowalski's head that he hasn't encountered in quite a while. Popping up in minor, but quite interesting or bizarre character roles are Paul Koslo, Robert Donner, Dean Jagger, John Amos, Anthony James and a eye-opening bike-riding nude Gilda Texter.It's flawed and lacks the force to make a huge imprint, but this trendy slice of the times is easy on the eyes and pure machismo fun in its bang-up car stunts. Worthy of its cult appeal.",Vanishing Point
27,paul2001sw-1,Vanishingly Little Point,3,29 August 2004,"'Vanishing Point', a chase movie from the early 1970s, can be easily related to other films of the same (or similar) genres. From its predecessor 'Easy Rider' it takes the bleak beauty of western America, a rollicking soundtrack and a structure whereby the continuum of life on the road is punctuated by emblematic, but vague, encounters. Like Spielberg's 'Duel', it is minimalistic in form. But it's outlaw philosophy has more in common with later, sillier films like 'Smokey and the Bandit' and 'The Cannonball Run' (in 'Easy Rider', the heroes simply want to mind their own business; but in 'Vanishing Point', beating the system is the end in itself). This might make the film seem more political, except for the complete vapidness of its central concept: that ""freedom"" can be defined as the right to burn enormous quantities of oil at life-endangering speeds (indeed, it appears that one of the ways in which the mainstream has persecuted our hero is to attempt to prevent him from driving when drunk). One could say that this film proceeds under the false cloak of counter culturalism, while selling us the same macho dreams as any mainstream Hollywood product. Yet without the pseudo-philosophical justification, this is a movie without point or purpose, whose central character acts without any rational motivation.For all that, the chase itself is gripping, though it's strange (especially for a European) to see what qualified as a sports car in America 30 years ago: this one has huge front and rear overhangs and ridiculously soft suspension. But the worst thing about this movie are its bizarre diversions from the main plot, which include: the cheesiest love scene I can remember; a strange, homophobia-tinged encounter with a couple of gay would-be car-hijackers; a racist attack, apropos of nothing; and, most oddly of all, a meeting with a motorcycling, naked blonde in the middle of the desert. The surprise ending which follows all this might have had an impact if the film that had preceded it had anything to say. The only real reason for watching this film today is as a period piece, a strange mix of reactionary and hippie values that clearly mark it a product of its time. But freedom does not mean irresponsibility; nor does irresponsibility in itself bring freedom, however oppressive we find may the life we are expected to live. Watch 'Five Easy Pieces', a timeless classic from the same era, for a real exploration of these themes.",Vanishing Point
28,gbill-74877,Highly watchable,7,17 July 2019,"It's cool that Vanishing Point works as both a testosterone-fueled car chase, with the 1970 Dodge Challenger muscle car barreling through magnificent wide open spaces on and off the road, and as a metaphor for so many of the things youth was seeking freedom from over the 1960's. The little snippets and references to Vietnam, the memory of a policeman assaulting a young woman, and the white mob attacking the African-American DJ and his producer are all fantastic. The car stunts and artistry of how the images along the road and in the desert are captured make the film highly watchable.There is something existential about the meaninglessness of what he's doing and his backstory that is gradually revealed, but unfortunately the film wants to have it both ways, and it doesn't always work. The idea that the guy drives like a maniac endangering everyone around him, and yet then gets out of his car to ensure they're (miraculously) ok after they crash is silly. The film also veers at times a little too much into macho male fantasy, e.g. the naked woman on the motorcycle in the desert, even if that may represent the sexual liberation of the day, and it's a decidedly heterosexual male fantasy. It was great to find that the couple of guys picked up along the road were actually just married, and I thought, wow, pretty nice for 1971, but then we see them act stereotypically and get the crap kicked out of them. I also thought the amount of Christian rock in the soundtrack was a little excessive.The film has a wonderful ending though, and you could really see it resonating with the counter culture, pushed to the limit and seeing the idealistic dreams of the 60's vanishing.",Vanishing Point
29,A_Different_Drummer,"Iconic, classic, and a ""gift"" for Mopar",9,22 November 2013,"When Chrysler was first approached for this film, the executive who eventually green-lighted their participation could not believe that anyone would ever watch it.

This 90 minute ad became such a cult hit that an attempt was made to redo it (kindly notice my selection of the word ""attempt"" and we will discuss the remake no more in this life). Barry Newman had proved a reliable TV actor to that point, but no one had guessed that he would infuse the character of Kowolski with such (pardon the pun) drive. Don't want to give too much away on the off chance you have not seen this film yet, but other reviewers who have opined that this film is a metaphor for the demise of America (from the freedom of the open road, to a police state, with rules and penalties for breaking those rules) may not be far off the mark.

30,atlasmb,A 1970s Classic,9,21 April 2014,"A few years before ""Smokey and the Bandit"" would present a confusing mixture of messages about the joys of traveling the road, came ""Vanishing Point"", a superb film about which so much could be written. I saw this film when it first came out--a nineteen year old who could really identify with the film's point of view.Yes, this film owes a debt to ""Easy Rider"" (1969) and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967), but the anti-heroes of ""Easy Rider"" were looking for truth. Kowalski, the anti-hero of ""Vanishing Point"" is looking for freedom.This film should be classified under ""fantasy"". It is a libertarian fantasy, a dream of escaping the control and corruption of the establishment (as it was then called). In the early 70s, a great turmoil enveloped this country. Those who fought for peace (in the shadow of the Vietnam conflict), racial equality, a redefining of gender roles, and the freedom of the individual to do or become whatever he desires (as long as it does not violate the freedom of others) became the counterculture, a massive challenge to the status quo and those who wished to maintain traditional values.Kowalski (Barry Newman) is a man who's background and history is revealed throughout the film. From a man who merely drives for a living, he becomes a man who is trying to cope with the tragedies and inequalities of his past. Eventually, he becomes a hero to the people on the fringe of society who recognize his fight as their own. He battles the ""blue meanies"" (a reference to The Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine""). There are various clues that this is a fantasy. No one gets hurt despite some dangerous activities. This is important because Kowalski is not out to hurt others. There are also some scenes that, though ""real"", seem almost to be dreams.As he drives his Challenger (of course) down western highways that disappear in the infinite at that vanishing point on the horizon, we begin to see that this is one man's rebellion, as assertion that he will no longer be controlled. This man of few words has nothing left to lose, perhaps.Accompanied by some great tunes and the encouragement of a blind DJ, Kowalski meets some interesting characters. Watch for Dean Jagger in a small, choice role as a snake hunter. ""Vanishing Point"" has a great cast of credited and uncredited actors and musicians.Will Kowalski (like Moses) lose his way in the desert, but eventually emerge to find a promised land? Will he become invincible and larger than life? Will he become a martyr, either by intention or by accident?One could write pages about this film and its messages. It helps to have seen it in 1971, to experience it as part of the milieu of its time. But this film is a metaphor for principles that are timeless.",Vanishing Point
31,Rodrigo_Amaro,It's fine but it's not all that great.,6,10 February 2018,"""Vanishing Point"" is one of the hailed movies that didn't lived up to my expectations. Might have been the ""Drive"" of its era (silent hero/car chases/improbable tasks) 
but it's difficult to form some sort of engage or find it exciting or appealing. I liked for plenty of good reasons, it's quite simple and reflects a lot about its era, one of 
those babies from the 1960's-1970's counter-culture that came after ""Easy Rider"" - guess you can say this is an ""Easy Rider"" on four wheels, with its rejection of conservative 
values and living like to the maximum on the fastlane. But it's not so much of a great film. It's just good and have some fun on the way.  Our hero is Kowalski (Barry Newman) and his mission is to deliver a beautiful white car (the film's actual lead) an 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T crossing a few states in a 
matter of days, a bet he makes with a friend. He's a qualified driver and will break all of the speeding limits, rules and get the police chasing him all the way, and he'll 
also face some other obstacles and some good company on the way, such as a snake charmer (Dean Jagger, great) and his oniscient guardian angel, a blind radio host who'll guide 
through the roads telling him about possible problems to come and to which ways he must lead (brilliantly played by Cleavon Little). He's rooting for Kowalski just as much as 
many other simple folks from the many towns he crosses. His only enemy is really the establishment, the authorities following his steps and getting lots of dirt thrown at 
their faces.  The pros about ""Vanishing"": the car chases and the stunts are excellent, first rate with great editing work and a fantastic cinematography by the always brilliant 
John A. Alonzo; the action sequences are of the most pure quality - the moments in between sometimes work, other times are just a snooze fest that had kept me rewinding to 
see what I had missed. The pacing is strange, it flows almost like a silent film (a nice touch and very unusal at the time - except the long chase in the classic ""The French 
Connection"" where all you hear and the sound of the car engine); the memorable lead character is beautiful to look at it, and I mean the car. It's a killing machine.
The movie feels as being just an action with no political context but there are plenty of them hidden there and I liked them all because their were real, relevant for its time, 
not to mention about a certain premonition of thrilling things to come. It's a lot more about the counter-culture or challenging the anti-establishment; it's also about 
giving a message. ""Vanishing Point"" tells about racial tension, it's very politically incorrect when it comes to that issue (and also the gay robbers - ""The Celluloid Closet"" took 
that scene way out of context) but it's all good because of that. Let's take Kowalski and his actions being praised and getting support from everyone, after all the only crime of his 
is breaking speeding limits and making some cops fall from their bikes. That's the law he's breaking, yet people like him, calling the last American hero when his real mission was 
just conquering the impossible with almost no harm done and winning his bet. He has to use of wrongful acts to do his job but he does it. I think of him being a prescient 
of Daniel Ellsberg and the leaking of the Pentagon Papers (not sure which came first: movie or leaking). Unconventional methods but had to be done in order to defy what was wrong with the Nixon administration and the previous ones 
concerning Vietnam War. To the American public he could be a hero or an anti-hero, when his name wasn't revealed to the public and the papers were getting published all around. 
Both Kowalski and Ellsberg were noble silent man with causes they considered important; not to mention both were part of the establishment and later on became the opposite (though 
delivering a car to whom we never know is kinda strange. At least gives us some urgency on why that car is important and to whom it is important). That's just my reading of this film.  Since the movie isn't perfect here comes the blows. Newman isn't an interesting lead, a more established name would benefit the movie in several ways.
He doesn't have charisma, only a bit of cool presence and knows how to keep the character's mystery going on. I never found that Kowalski had a true
 motive for all the running. The movie fails in giving us urgency about his mission, it's all about racing against time, run away from the cops and we don't even have a good antagonist sheriff or police officer (I picture Bruce Dern or some veteran actor 
playing some of those roles to make us view both sides of the duel). Therefore, the drama is quite shallow, lacking in power and losing in effectiveness. 
All I can say is that had it been a comedy, it'd be hilarious and far more interesting (I only have the ending in mind). And the ending we've got 
disappointed big time but it's something that was common during Nixon era (counter-culture must not conquer all).  Weighing down in the balance, there's merits but they're far from reaching their ultimate potential. Fun to watch but it's not that brilliant. Slightly overrated. A cool movie to watch with your friends, specially the ones who love speed, car chases, crazy situations or a naked woman riding on a bike. 6/10P.S.: Though not a fan, Audioslave's clip ""Show me How to Live"" was a perfect homage to the film.",Vanishing Point
32,funkyfry,"oh boy, it's *that* type of movie",3,4 August 2008,"About halfway through the movie I realized that I was watching a truly bad movie, one of the ones that's interesting enough and bad enough to be unintentionally funny. It takes a little while to get that, because the photography is very good and some of the action is decent, but the horribly cheesy flashbacks pretty much point where the movie is ultimately going -- to the point where quality itself vanishes. The hero of the movie, Kowalski, is supposed to be some sort of nihilist hero. I guess nihilism is all you have left after you've admitted that your whole grasp of 60s idealism was rooted in free love and free drugs, which this movie seems pretty unabashed to admit. My girlfriend came in about half an hour from the end of the movie, and as it was ending she was saying ""this doesn't make any sense!"" I said, ""oh yeah it makes total sense, you just missed all the important stuff. You see, his girlfriend was killed in a tragic surfing accident...."". Oh yes, it's *that* kind of movie too, the kind of movie that's painfully self-serious and consciously tragic.I suppose there was some kind of attempt to be deep there. He was a cop, a good representative of 60s morality, he even could have been one of the Beach Party kids. But then his girlfriend was killed in the tragic surfing accident and he got in a car crash or something. Oh yeah and he witnessed another cop abusing a suspect, that was pretty life changing for him apparently. All of this is told to us in painfully intrusive flashbacks. There's a confused attempt to tie the whole thing in to the ""Easy Rider"" biker genre as well.Basically this movie was like ""Billy Jack"" with cars, except that unlike ""Billy Jack"" there's no sincerity in the movie, and the professionalism of the whole package seems to dull any edge of ""anti-establishment"" that might have been mined from the screenplay. It's like the TV version of ""Easy Rider"", which makes sense since the director is the same guy who later made the TV versions of ""African Queen"" and ""Splendor in the Grass."" At one point we're supposed to be all worked up because an annoying black DJ gets beat up by racist cops (I was just hoping it would mean we wouldn't have to listen to him anymore). It's all too poorly done to even feel manipulative in its stupid, obvious way. But then to make things infinitely worse, there's the obligatory scene where he picks up two gay hitch-hikers and beats them up (of course it was ""justified"", because they tried to rob him). So the movie wallows in ignorance and stereotypes while at the same time it tries to lay claim to 60s styled idealism that must have seemed a bit passé in 1971 when the film was released. The hero is a guy who refuses weed but loves popping amphetamines. This is exactly the stuff that destroyed the ""hippie"" movement, but this film glorifies it. Basically this is a movie that would have made you feel really embarrassed if you were actually part of the peace movement; it's just exploiting some of the tropes for nudity and so forth without having any of the soul of real revolution. This movie posits empty destructive nihilism as the same thing or perhaps more glamorous than actual liberalism.There's a nice strange bit where he meets an old man in the desert played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger. By the time you get to the hippie biker in the desert, you can't help cracking up when you see his naked girlfriend riding a motorcycle in circles in the desert, stark naked. That hot bike seat must really burn her butt! Why would someone do something like that? Would it be fun? No, it would just look ""cool"" in a stupid movie like this.I give the movie a few points for unintentional comedy and for a very cool soundtrack including an appearance by the legendary flower gospel group ""Delaney and Bonnie and Friends."" Basically I would recommend people watch better films with a more sincere point in the same vein that followed after ""Easy Rider,"" like ""Electra Glide in Blue"" and ""Two-Lane Blacktop."" This one is truly half-baked.",Vanishing Point
33,RodrigAndrisan,Unique road movie!,8,4 January 2018,"I do not agree with suicide, however tough and ugly, however depressing and struck by your fate, life is worth living! That said as a principle, I do not quite understand the end of the movie, why Kowalski chooses to commit suicide, after all the attempts he is passing through and out of which he went so well. He was not depressed, he had a strong moral, very tough guy, he had no reason to choose that stupid death, entering with his high-speed car into the dam on the road. Barry Newman, Cleavon Little, Dean Jagger and Paul Koslo are all OK in their roles. A very nice and original appearance by Gilda Texter in the role of Nude Rider. Cool music in the soundtrack, many songs, Mountain with ""Mississippi Queen"", Kim Carnes, etc. A film that enjoyed my teens and whom I had been happy to review, except for the final, which I had forgotten, which is unjustified and disappointing. Richard C. Sarafian has many exciting movies under his belt.",Vanishing Point
34,Chris_Docker,Iconic film,9,8 September 2007,"Maybe some films are easier to appreciate with the knowledge of hindsight. I only watched Vanishing Point after my curiosity was aroused by Tarantino's Death Proof. In Death Proof, one of the leading characters repeatedly hero-worships and refers to Vanishing Point's protagonist, Kowalski, who is a car delivery driver.The film was the inspiration for a number of rock music projects (such as an album by Primal Scream also called Vanishing Point). Its iconic status is also underlined by several remakes and references in film culture.My first objective was simply to experience the movie, the headlong rush, the adrenalin it created (or deficiency thereof). But I knew that afterwards I would want to ask why it had achieved a cult status. Our attitude of mind probably influences our film experience. In this case, prior knowledge maybe even opened me up to regarding it with a certain respect. Although I can think of other films where that has been the case and I have simply disagreed with the mainstream opinion. In the case of Vanishing Point, I feel my optimism was justified.Vanishing Point, which positions itself as a car chase involving ""the maximum trip at the maximum speed,"" follows Kowalski across several state lines. He is trying to deliver a supercharged 1970 white Dodge Challenger from Denver, Colorado, to California. He takes some benzedrine and makes a bet with a local drug dealer on how fast he can reach his destination.Kowalski is able to outrun police cars. Not only is he driving a powerful car, but small flashbacks (augmenting largely minimalist dialogue) show that Kowalski has a professional racing background. What begins as a small pursuit over minor traffic violations becomes an interstate hunt out of all proportion.Flashbacks also pay testament to Kowalski's upright character - the very opposite of how is soon being portrayed by the police. An African-American DJ called Super Soul - Kowalski tunes to his radio station almost throughout - also builds our portrait of Kowalski. Super Soul, by tuning in to police broadcasts, is also able to give our intrepid driver tips to avoid capture.As verbal exchanges involving Kowalski - a man on a sort of mission - are so few, the image built by Super Soul is paramount. The DJ refers to car and driver with phrases like, ""soul mobile"" and ""soul challenger"" and says the cops are gonna, ""rape the last beautiful free soul on this planet."" Just hip talk from a fast-talking DJ? But whether we later choose to consider the building blocks that lead to this film's influence, the characters-as-archetypes factor has a force that also works on a subconscious level. Bear in mind this movie is set in 70s, post-Vietnam, post-Woodstock America. Amid growing disillusionment of government, advances in civil rights, and an atmosphere where many radical ideas of the 60's gain wider acceptance in mainstream life and culture.Characterisation of minor players is so vivid that there would be every tendency to interpret them symbolically. But they are always entertaining. From our almost psychic DJ, to a desert hobo who seems half-crazed, gay hitchhiker hoodlums, a biker who fashions Kowalski a 'pig pass (to fool a roadblock), or to the caring girlfriend - with blonde hair streaking behind her - as she traverses the desert nude on her motorbike.So how does Kowalski achieve an almost demi-god defining status? The use of language that is at once casual and symbolic is nothing new. But the substance has to come from the story itself. He has to become the archetype, much as god-kings of legend. His life has to become a symbol of all that he stands for. The beginning and ending of the film, when compared, provide these defining moments.The mystically inclined might like to ponder a phrase by the great philosopher Kant: ""The transcendental subject is not an entity to be found or recognized within experience, but neither is it transcendent, altogether independent of experience; rather, it is like the vanishing point of a perspectival painting."" Kant is referring to identity, personality, or 'soul'. Something that we know is actually there but which we can only define by what's around it.Our 'last American hero' has been clearly defined in the shape of Kowalski. He stands for himself - rather than country as suggested by the authority of the state. He is pitted against the hubris of a society that 'stood' for all the right things and then lost its way. Vanishing Point not only lauds great American values, it gives voice to the frustration of decent, freedom-loving citizens. Rebel-Without-A-Cause for grown-ups comes to mind! And the story is set in those memorable - symbolic if you will- open spaces and open roads of the American Golden West.Director Richard C. Sarafian said he wanted to make Kowalski appear outerworldly, and that the world within the film was a temporary existence. But the film doesn't force this on its audience. It can be enjoyed at a purely visceral level. It is an all-time great in terms of car pursuits, unencumbered by being the 'chase' add-on to another story. If the idea of rebellion doesn't appeal to you, it may seem a bit empty. But even then you may enjoy pondering the various meanings of the title.A totally different (if misleadingly appropriate) interpretation of the common phrase 'vanishing point' is given in a police rider-safety guide: ""Find a good bend, it doesn't matter if it is to the right or to the left, and look for the point where the two verges appear to meet. This is the vanishing, or limit, point. If you enter a curve and you seem to be catching up to this point then you are travelling too fast.""",Vanishing Point

36,TdSmth5,I expected more,5,7 December 2013,"A guy driving a white Dodge Challenger is being chased by helicopters and cop cars. Further down the road, at a town's entrance, cops are setting up a road block with dozers no less.We then start at the beginning. The driver is to deliver the gorgeous Challenger in San Francisco, he takes some speed as he offers to be there sooner than anyone expects. At first it looks like he's driving leisurely but cops on motorcycles ask him to pull over and he drives them off the road. The chase is on, spanning Colorado, Nevada, and California. On the way he meets a guy who collects snakes in the middle of the desert and exchanges them for food with snakecharming Christians. He further meets a pretty gas station attendant, a biker and his pretty nude girl, two homosexuals who are actually out to grab him for the police, a pretty hitchhiker in the night. Wherever he goes he asks for drugs, and all the women he meets have a thing for him, even though he doesn't have a lot to say about anything.While this is going on we meet a black radio dj who is blind, has an affinity for the driver's ""cause"" (whatever that may be) and has a special talent/connection with the driver. He knows what the cops are up to, he engages in a ""conversation"" with the driver hearing what he answers to his questions.Little by little we also learn about the driver's past in flashbacks. He used to be a moral cop who stopped a colleague from raping a girl they arrested. He was a good race car driver. He had a surfer girlfriend who died.None of this changes his inevitable path, and he doesn't seem to care. Perhaps it's the drugs, the endless driving in the desert, but he acts as if wherever he goes there will be a way out, a shortcut, a dirt road he can take.Vanishing Point is a surprisingly empty movie. The driving scenes are OK for the time I guess, although something tells me the stunts could have been better. There's not a whole lot of accidents and mayhem, just a lot of driving and scenes of the guy's empty expression. To make this tolerable we get a whole lot of loud music instead of various genres. I would like to have seen more of the small towns and their people- we just get short glances.What surprised me was how little Hollywood has changes over the decades. In a way this movie has everything that Hollywood is criticized for- it portrays easy drug use, gratuitous (but welcome) nudity, white evil racist cops, stereotypical blacks, superficiality. Given how famous this movie is, I sure expected more depth, more meaning.",Vanishing Point

There was obviously an appetite for road movies at this time of social change and counter-culture. Vanishing Point encompasses the best that Hollywood has to reflect on the subject. There is a very 'ordinary America' feel about this movie, as it shows multiple points of view without taking any particular stance. I loved the many, many shots of ordinary Americans throughout the movie, giving an almost documentary edge. It's brilliant, but the cinematographer is much, much better than just that. This is one movie that should be required viewing for any aspiring film student. There are just so many techniques used, all are spot on, and they all blend perfectly. Add to this a very unusual collection of characters, and some brilliant locations, and you have what can only be described as 'road candy'.

Not much of a plot really, an ex cop (and racing driver), scores some benzedrine pills and then makes a fun bet with his drug dealer (called Jake), that he can race across the states to San Francisco, by 3pm the next day (driving across Colorado, Utah and Nevada). Basically it's just one thrilling car chase after another, involving police cars and choppers. The hero stops halfway across, when he encounters a lovely girl riding a motorcycle and for some reason without wearing any clothing (maybe feeling too hot, lol) but once again is soon behind the wheel of his supercharged white Dodge Challenger.",Vanishing Point

Turned out the car chases only happen in the beginning of the film, good stuff with the main character – () and his – teaching some driving lessons to every cop that tries to stop them (and also to every driver that challenge them!), but, and I don't want to sound disrespectful, the last car chase in DEATH PROOF is much more intense and more cool. The surprises began when I didn't see the very best car chases ever (obviously not very good news but I can't use ""bad news"" since those scenes are darn good, only not very impressive) and continued as the movie advanced, which is good news.",Vanishing Point

Anyway, it's hard to believe now that the hitchhiker is a 25 year old Charlotte Rampling, eho is still acting almost 50 years later.

I recall the dodge challenger, the scene with the corrupt police and the cool music. Barry Newman in the leading role, was a film star who never was in a sense. He seemed destined for fairly big things but after a few routine movies, his career was knocked off course and he was soon forgotten. His character gives the distinct impression of being rather a troubled soul who doesn't belong any longer. His only aim in life, is to drive and to deliver fast cars for a living. He is a restless spirit but is also tormented by his past. We are given glimpses of his life via some great flashback scenes. Barry Newman is OK, he fits the bill without being very heavyweight as an actor. Cleavon Little is outstanding as the blind radio D.J who guides Barry Newman past police traps. The photography and the music are the main assests from ""Vanishing Point."" The stunt driving is easily on a par with the car chase scenes from ""Bullitt"" or ""The French Connection.""

45,chrichtonsworld,Don't understand the hype,5,22 June 2007,"Born in the mid seventies, I always have some special memories from this period. I know a lot of movies were made in this era that are classics. I never heard of Vanishing Point until I saw Death Proof, second movie from Grindhouse were the same car is being featured. And since someone referred to this film I had to check it out for myself.I must admit that were some great stunts in this one. If you encounter a lunatic like Kowalski on the road how would you react? It is then funny to witness that the main character in the white dodge is perceived as a hero. Apparently it seems that everybody from that period who took a stand against authority was a hero. But Kowalski isn't a hero he (Barry Newman) was just dangerous. And for a former cop and a professional race driver he sure drove like a madman. He didn't seem in control of the steering wheel. Maybe Kowalski was tired and and he had enough but the path he chose wasn't heroic at all. It could very well be that there were some reasons and motivations for driving like he does. But we never get to know them so why should I care. I was hoping for some great chase sequences and truly dazzling stunts. Or why else would so many people be praising this film. But apart from a few nice stunts these aren't present. The whole film is basically about a man driving from point A to point B without offering much else. Many fans of this film will have let you believe that so much more is going on. That it is meaningful and deep. Why does every film where drugs play a large role in events is being claimed as the second coming? Just because drugs can alter and warp the way you think does not always mean it's good or enlightening. I am not anti drugs or anything but we do have to be real and admit why most people resort to drugs and alcohol. Apart from making them feel good these substances offer an escape from reality. From time to time that can help you deal with things if it gets too much for you. However don't pretend that using will give you the answers you seek. Most of the time it won't. But here you have fans who claim otherwise and try to preach the non existent gospel of the film like in text beneath. "" So maybe this has been covered already. But since this movie is basically a flashback, he is already dead, that part is not disputable. However, I think, his journey, through the desert, is actually his trip through purgatory. Everyone he meets is basically a lost soul, but they are helping him on his destination. His wife was already dead from the surfing accident. Like Dante, he is traveling through purgatory to find his love. He is constantly tempted to be untrue, the gas station attendant and the nude girl, but he refuses. At the end, he see the light, between the bulldozers, like a tunnel into heaven, he knows on the other end is his lost love."" Extracted from wikipedia: Actor Barry Newman (Kowalski) also thought that the entire film was an essay on existentialism. Kowalski drives to drive, with no real purpose for doing what he's doing. He decides to give his life its definition and meaning, with complete freedom over his actions. Director Sarafian explained that he wanted to make Kowalski appear otherworldly and that the world within the film was a temporary existence that he was just making a stop in. At the end of the film, he was ascending from this existence into another. The lyrics of the end song underscore this interpretation: ""Nobody knows, nobody sees, till the light of life stops burning, till another soul goes free.""Even if above comments are true and director Sarafian wanted to convey this he did a poor job of it. How convenient it is that most of the story and characterization is so abstract that you can make out of it whatever you want without having to prove much. It is this kind of pretension that bothers me. Because it is very easy to be vague and abstract. How often don't we hear that some epic moments in films have been unintentional. And usually have been caused by mistakes like running out of film. How can we be sure that in this case something happened and prevented to film that next scene that would have put everything in perspective? Or perhaps that scene was filmed but that the director decided not to put it in since it would give a too good of explanation that simply might not have been as exciting or mind blowing. How do we know for sure that what eventually is shown in the film has been intentional? Vanishing Point didn't struck a cord with me at all. I am all for substance but then you have to offer something real and nothing something you have to imagine yourself. I know my imagination is huge. However that does not mean storytellers always can get away with excluding their answer to the problems raised. If you want to challenge me then you need to do better than that. Give your answer. I will give mine. And then we can debate it. It is here where we truly learn from each other. In the end Vanishing point is a film about a man driving from point A to point B. Nothing to get excited about.",Vanishing Point

Once Newman is detected speeding, a lengthy car chase ensues that covers several states.  Nice photography of the Open West;  great, understated performance by Newman.

47,blott2319-1,A film as dry as the desert they drive through.,4,17 September 2020,"There isn't much story to Vanishing Point. It's a movie about a guy who is delivering a car 3 states away and he's determined to get it there on time, despite the fact that police are trying to chase him down for reckless driving. The way he puts so many lives at risk doesn't exactly make him endearing for me, even though they always make a point of showing that he hasn't actually hurt anyone. There are some interesting elements to his journey, but in general I found Vanishing Point to be flat and dull. All the little stops along the way feel like a time capsule of what was going on in the nation back in the mid-to-late 1970s, which I suppose is worthwhile for some people but it never developed his character any further which was something I needed in order to care more about the story.I'm not a big car guy, so watching a 90 minute car chase doesn't do much to intrigue me. I liked some of the stunts, but when they spent long stretches of time just driving down the road I was bored. To be honest, I was more interested in Cleavon Little as the DJ who was trying to help the protagonist on his journey. The way he latches onto this story and creates a sort of folk hero out of this lone man on the run was the best part of Vanishing Point. Barry Newman was quite cold and distant, so it was hard to connect with him as a protagonist anyways. There were a few fun characters that he met along the way, but in general Vanishing Point was nothing more than a decent snapshot of the 1970s, and otherwise it felt like a lackluster movie.",Vanishing Point
48,Joxerlives,An arguably superior reworking of Easy Rider,8,9 March 2013,"Very, very interesting film, you really can't watch it and not seriously consider buying a Dodge Challenger and taking off across the western US afterwards (certainly Top Gear's Richard Hammond does). In Easy Rider we had the bikers who were still open to the future and all its' possibilities. Vanishing Point is a much more cynical film, its' hero is actually an establishment figure, a decorated war veteran (presumably he must have been an adviser to the South Vietnamese military in the early 60s as regular US forces weren't deployed until 1965), a cop, a surfer and professional racer. But he seems to have become disillusioned with it and arguably with the 60s counter-culture as well. In some ways this is the longest suicide note in history (and arguably one of the failings of the film is it is slightly too long). We never know WHY he makes his epic drive, perhaps he is haunted by his inner demons and cannot simply bare to sit still any more, as long as he keeps moving they cannot catch him. It seems a little trite that he causes all this damage but never actually harms anyone. That the police are chasing him purely for his speeding but they're still right to do so, the law must be enforced for the good of all and perhaps that's what both Kowalksi and Soul Superstar realise at the last. Some interesting touches, the warning sign saying 'Stop' as he tears out of Denver, the fact that when his drug dealer asks him what he wants he just replies 'Speed'.An entertaining film which defines its' era.",Vanishing Point

In his way he was helped by a gay and a naked woman as well as by radio communication with some of his friends. At certain point when he was already reaching California he was advised to stop by his friend but he continued to a final crash. The film probably wanted to show a person who was looking for a kind of freedom, he personally was a good man, experienced in Vietman war and also as a decent policeman.

It makes me want to purchase a white 2008 Challenger. Cleavon Little's ""Super Soul"" DJ was a nice addition and served to tie everything together. He and Kowalski were kindred souls in that they somehow didn't fit in.They were both tortured souls.The movie was bookended with the bulldozer scene. Very thought-provoking, beautiful cinematography. One blooper - a cop is reviewing Kowalski's history - he was a Vietnam Vet. He was decorated for his combat action in the Mekong Delta in 1964.

It is a very engaging road movie, in which former decorated soldier, policeman and car racer Kowalski (Newman) is chased by police across the USA, and duing the course of which he meets interesting men, beautiful women, and has recollections of war, of his time in the police force, relations with women, and other unusual characters.VANISHING POINT is also a credible 1970s time capsule: the trends, changing relations, and other signs of that decade are present.Photography is splendid, action sequences likewise, Sarafian's direction memorable, and acting very good across the board, all very natural and simple.The weakness is the inclusion of oracle-like high falutin' Super Soul (Cleavon Little) as a radio man who communicates with Kowalski, and the ending. I could not be believe that highly experienced racing driver Kowalski did not see the caterpillars on the road to block him off, after spotting, and surmounting all other dangers during the journey. What is more, at the beginning you see him spot the caterpillars, turn around, and flee.I also did not understand the racist attack on the radio station, only for it to continue operating. It just seemed like some statement that Sarafian wished to make. It might even be significant, but it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.All told, VANISHING POINT is well worth watching. 8/10",Vanishing Point
54,mgd_m,Hollow,2,15 June 2019,"Vanishing Point is a B-movie with some good moments, but no characters, no dialogues, and a thin plot. I guess all of its cult value came from the hippie rhetoric that spills throughout the movie, and that frankly is quite annoying. The whole movie is based on a huge trick, the vanishing of the car at 10:02 AM at the start, that literally means nothing. The editing is very poor.",Vanishing Point
55,OldAle1,self-conscious mysticism doesn't quite gel with this cross-country chase film,5,21 April 2008,"I finally got around to this after six months of being reminded that it was a primary influence on Tarantino when he was making ""Death Proof"". Well, I hated the Tarantino film, but I did like the car chase sequences in it; heck, I've always liked car chases, who doesn't like car chases? So it was with a mixture of trepidation and excitement that I popped this baby in the DVD player.I needn't have bothered, actually. Sure, the white Charger is cool and there are several good sequences of the ""hero"", Kowalski (Barry Newman) evading cops, off-roading through the desert, etc, but the film's would-be mysticism and self-conscious attempts to hit the hippie/druggie audience wear thin pretty quickly, and there just isn't enough reality to any of the characters to take the thing straight even if we were intended to.Cleavon Little's turn as blind (and apparently visionary) disk jockey Super Soul, broadcasting black music in the middle of nowhere in the Southwest (THAT calls for a suspension of disbelief for sure) is nice, but the scene where he and his engineer (John Amos in a thankless role) are beaten up by a mob seems completely pointless and geared towards a political agenda that is otherwise resolutely unclear in this weird mess of a film. Dean Jagger is his usual reliable self as the desert-dwelling prospector who helps Kowalski on his way towards his destiny with.....who cares. Nice double-sided DVD transfer; I watched the shorter American cut first, but the 2nd side British version wasn't viewable. And it didn't much bug me.",Vanishing Point
56,Eddie_weinbauer,Interesting piece of movie,4,26 April 2015,"With a lot of nice landscape scenery.But the movie is rather poorly put together,but you can see where Walter hill got his radio idea to the warriors from.This is a road movie if I ever seen one.Not sure if it's the first nor the greatest,but a road movie none the less. But cause of the way its put together, it's sadly only mildly entertaining. I dunno if the importance of the backstory on kowalski ended on the cutting room floor, or it was put together this way on purpose. But The back story comes in minor flashback sequences, and I think they are suppose to be relevant in terms of getting to know the background of our antihero.For me it just doesn't work,cause they have skipped too much on how he got be where he is, when you meet him.Some of the scenes in the movie are really confusing at times. For instance when he could have avoided a roadblock by simply going around them,he flee from them instead.While other times he simply do just that,drive around them And you never know why it was so important to get the car to Sand Francisco.There are a lot of hinting or implying that girls he meet have some sort of connection to he's past,but they never really clarify it.Is it just that they remind him of someone he once had a connection with,or are they the girls from the past he sees in he's flashback?",Vanishing Point
57,j-lacerra,Drive On,6,31 March 2007,"This is kind of an odd little movie, featuring the relatively obscure Barry Newman as the driver of a 1970 Dodge Challenger, who has made a bet that he can deliver this vehicle from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours. Naturally, the various local highway patrols take exception to him accomplishing this feat, and ... the chase is on! We have a little bit of Easy Rider and a little bit of Sugarland Express mixed here with a sprinkle of Bullit and 'Bandit' for seasoning.Flashbacks that are way too short are inserted to give us some insight into the character of Kowalski (Newman), and they serve to explain little. Newman displays the acting skill of a stick, and encounters characters who are all stereotypes: 'Cranky Old Wilderness Guy' (see Jeremiah Johnson), sexually liberated naked flower child, white racist country music types, sympathetic blind black guy, bumbling cops, etc. Particularly annoying is the usually enjoyable Cleavon Little as the blind DJ trying to help Kowalski.In the end, in the UK version, Charlotte Rampling is employed to play a cadaverous hitch hiker (Death?), who Kowalski makes love to and then, of course, must race to a blazing suicidal crash.Is this movie harmful? No. It passes its 97 minutes (UK) mildly entertaining. But the let down at the end has you asking, ""What was that all about?""",Vanishing Point

I laughed many times, because it is just plain crazy. Nothing makes any sense. The guy is a hero just for driving fast. Hilarious! The police is obsessed with making him drive slower. Why would anybody order a car that has to be brought from so far away? The guy is driving so fast, and on top of that through the desert, that he is slowly destroying the car he is supposed to deliver. Hilarious, just hilarious!",Vanishing Point
59,headly66,Could have been great...,4,23 December 2009,"Vanishing Point seems to be one of those films on the cusp between the 60's era psychedelia and the 70's tough guy cop chase movies. It has elements of both and could have been so much more had it focused more on the main character and less on the nonsense. In so many films of this type the lead meets up with the strangest people just to be strange and it adds little to the overall story. I recall the scene in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot where they encounter that crazy guy who shoots rabbits from his trunk and funnels the exhaust into the cars interior, why, we don't know and never find out. In Vanishing Point we have to two weird gay bandits in one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever watched and a revival meeting in the desert that seems just thrown in and pointless.The Dodge Challenger obviously is just incredible and is a star in it's own right and the shots of it screaming across the desert highways are just fantastic. I'm not sure of the whole delivery premise to begin with, he doesn't seem to care if the car is damaged, so why is he in a hurry to deliver it and didn't they have Dodge dealerships in CA in 1970???. Is it a death wish from the start? It's hard to see this now and realize that car was brand new and one of the true monsters of the road at the time. The movie is dated like most older films but I don't rate movies based on that, you have to take into account the time and not compare it to today.Clevon Little's role is just incredibly stupid with him feeling the drivers moves or whatever and the music they choose does not fit the scenario at all, you would of expected a much harder soundtrack. I'm still not sure why there is a soul station in the middle of nowhere, and it must have one powerful signal to reach such a long distance. In fact the music here is so bad and forgettable I can't imagine anyone listing it as part of the reason they like this film. A lot of movies from this era used groups they thought were going to be popular or are friends of the producer, there is not one hit from the 60's or 70's here except ""Mississippi Queen"" which is used for ten seconds and in the wrong place.More weird to be weird is the naked chick but I guess there is a running theme of wispy blonds in his past, but how in the hell would she have a collage of his history?The ending is so disconnected from the rest of the movie, the crowd awaiting his arrival don't even seem to be in the same scene and it ends so anticlimactically. Why did they suddenly use a Camaro to blow up instead of the Dodge, you can even see the letters on the side nameplate. The beginning had a good feel to it and I can't imaging how great this would have been had it been more structured and been a straight action film instead of trying to become some religious message wrapped in a Challenger.",Vanishing Point
60,FeverDog,Too much an artifact of its time... *SPOILER*,3,19 May 2001,"Ok, I just rented Vanishing Point based on my roommate's constant raves about it.  Well, I'll be the first to admit that I just don't get it.I've read other comments alluding to its allegorical Christian and post-60s subtexts.  Fine.  But for a film to work metaphorically, it needs to work on a literal level.  What we have here are details that don't make much sense. Does Kowalski really hear Cleavon Little in his mind, or the radio?  (It's hard to believe that a Denver radio station's output can reach all the way to Nevada.)  What's with the racist attack on Little at the station?  (The bluntedly obvious irony of the attack juxtaposed with a ""Love Everyone"" tune aside, the purpose of the scene failed to enlighten me or propel the story.) What's with the choir in the desert?  What's with the naked chick???  And all the flashbacks and police reports didn't tell me a whole lot about what makes this guy tick.  What is the point of this movie???  That men desire the open desert road with no societal restrictions???  Don't stop the presses...Anyway, like I said, I'm probably not tuned in to its message (I never cared for Easy Rider, either.)  Vanishing Point was made three years before I was born, and perhaps I needed to have experienced the era to appreciate something like this (this may be why I adore Almost Famous, Dazed and Confused, and Woodstock so much for their nostalgia purposes - jeez, how much do I wish my parents conceived me twenty years earlier!)  I do, however, admire the filmmaking techniques of this time, especially the downbeat endings (I'm a big fan of They Shoot Horses, Don't They), which is why I saw the crash coming from so far away, I had time to trim my nails and read my EW.  Cool car, though.So, if somebody can clue me in, drop me a line.  In the meantime, I'll just keep spinning my Zeppelin and Who CDs, and remember a past for which I wasn't present. 3/10",Vanishing Point
61,chucknorrisfacts,Great movie!,10,6 August 2012,"Kowalski is the epitome of disillusionment. Everything he's ever tried doing in life has ended in failure, from attempted careers in stock/bike racing and law enforcement to even his love life, as evidenced when he isn't there to save his girlfriend from drowning.Kowalski's been relegated to taking a position as a driver for Argo's Car Delivery service in Denver, Colorado, where he takes possession of a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T that must be delivered to San Francisco, California in four days time. On his way out of town, Kowalski stops at a biker bar seeking to obtain some ""bennies"", slang for Benzedrine, a stimulant similar to methamphetamine. He makes a bet with his dealer Jake (for the price of drugs) that he can make it from Denver to Frisco in just fifteen hours (considerably sooner than his actual deadline). Jake initially thinks Kowalski is putting him on, to which Kowalski replies ""I wish to God I was..."" Now, that's an interesting response considering we, the audience, know that Kowalski doesn't actually have to be there that fast. So, why say it? It seems rather obvious that he's got more of a stake in getting to Frisco than he's willing to admit...but what's in Frisco? This is just speculation on my part, but I don't believe anything is waiting for him in the ""City by the Bay"". I think he sets up a seemingly low-stakes bet for drugs in the same way a childhood friend might have dared you to dare him to throw a rock through a window. It was something he wanted to do anyway, but if you dared him to do it -- he had to do it, or he was ""chicken"". I think Kowalski did very much the same thing by telling Jake he had to be to San Fran in an almost impossible amount of time. He could've just set out across the American Southwest all his own sans bet and still tried to make it as quickly as possible, but by getting Jake to bet him, he was now accountable to someone other than himself to succeed, or die trying.He wants to make it from Denver to San Francisco in fifteen hours to ""redeem"" himself for his past failures. He's isn't suicidal, he's just reckless, The harder the authorities give chase, the harder he flees.Sandy, Kowalski's boss at Argo's Car Delivery, gives an interview to a newsman later in the movie that suggests the reason Kowalski never ""made the grade"" as a stock/bike racer was not because he didn't have the goods, but rather because he never really cared about winning. This would certainly suggest a nihilistic mindset, for which Kowalski simply didn't see the point in winning, or at least he didn't at that time.I think by the time Kowalski decides to take his fateful trip, he's taken a more existential approach and decided his trip is a way through which he can give his own life meaning. In the grand scheme of things, do Kowalski's life or his chase really matter? Maybe not, but it helped to give him a purpose. It also provided us with probably the only existential car chase movie in existence and one hell of a good time!",Vanishing Point
62,jwpeel-1,The Nixon years in a chase movie metaphor.,9,16 May 2005,"The plot. Simple. A man who tried to fit in (Kowalski played enigmatically by underrated actor Barry Newman) finally has it and decides to just point a social finger at ""the man"" and race his car cross country for some speed. (Talk about your obvious metaphors, but hey, the point is made.) This can be viewed as a chase movie but then you would most likely be as unsatisfied as some of the people who thought this movie sucked. Well, I have said countless times, ""it sucks"" can never be construed as ""constructive criticism."" Anyway, add a blind D.J. named Super Soul (another underrated actor, Cleavon Little) making a point to the consternation of some redneck yahoos, a naked blonde in the desert, assorted counterculture types (I always hated that term, but I use it here just for the sake of clarity and not having to type too much) and you have a quirky movie that works on many levels IF YOU LIVED THROUGH THE SIXTIES or at the very least, have a ""guide"" of sorts who did.Okay. Time for a brief history lesson.The Nixon metaphor. If you know about the 1960s, you know that there were many student protests against the war and against forms of corporate racism, sexism and just about anything that the Nixon ""Silent Majority"" detested. Most of us did not have the power of the vote because then, you had to be 21 to use that power then. (In my own case, having a December birthday, it wouldn't have mattered anyway since I would not be 18 until AFTER the presidential election. But I digress) We young folkies had no real say, and Nixon beat us into the ground, which culminated, albeit indirectly, with the Kent State killings, the death of some Black Panthers and basically shutting us the hell up to disco our butts into the ground. What a waste! But we had movies like this to make us think, or, at the very least, to have discussions and write our own damn movies in our heads, or just in our b.s. We had an outlet, small though it may have been. But, film is forever, and this one, with its trappings of sex, drugs and rock and roll, gave us a good time all around.So, for those of you who say, ""Hey! Leave the analyzing out of this,"" you can't. If you do that, this movie has nothing. Yes, enjoy it by all means, but see what it says or make your own judgments as to what Kowalski was all about and who represented what.Now, there are some serious car guys talking about this flick, and I confess that I know nothing about cars except that they have tires and motors and take you from point A to point B. Hell, I didn't even drive until well after I got out of the military, but I did do a helluva lot of hitchhiking, and never tried to hurt a driver like the guys in this flick. Still, I am grateful to the intense info on automotives given by so many of you reviewers here.And just for the record, don't waste time with the pathetic remake of this one. If you can't even have the decency of a naked blonde on screen (Yeah, I know the other one was a TV flick and they couldn't do that. All the more reason not to remake the thing on the small screen.) ""Vanishing Point"" is a vital record of a time gone by and we seem to be reliving in some small way now under the current regime...I mean...administration.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Kowalski, our speeding hero in the cool white car smiles as he ""vanishes"" but actually crashes and burns into the barricades while several of his new fans look on. I was confused by the vanishing when I first saw this film at age 20, but it's really simple if you use your gray matter. The man wanted to vanish and escape a worthless existence and in his mind, at least, that's what he did. Vanished! Similar endings have been done in films like ""Thelma And Louise"" and they made just as much sense - or nonsense. I didn't always like such endings, but here it is the only way to go. It worked!

63,duraflex,Great car - mediocre movie,3,9 August 2008,"I owned a Dodge Challenger of that era and that is the only reason I watched ""Vanishing Point"". The car is the star of this very weak movie.Why the great urgency to deliver the car? Who would knowingly hire a drug-dependent driver to deliver cars from one locale to another? Kowalski is determined to win a bet based on a small drug deal. Forget the condition the car might arrive in - if it arrives at all, which it doesn't.The premise of the story is preposterous and silly.The script, the characterizations, the dialog are all lame. The direction is one step above amateur. The driving and camera work are good but that's about it.Newman has looks and charm but the character he plays is almost a cartoon.The continuity errors are numerous - ie: the car suffers apparent damage that disappears in subsequent scenes.Save your time or watch it with the sound off. At the very least, spare yourself the director's wacky running commentary - which only proves that drugs really do damage your mind.",Vanishing Point
64,BoomerDT,"Exciting, But More Illogical Than ""Gilligan's Island""",6,31 July 2015,"I can remember reading a review for ""VP"" when it was released that said something to the effect of ""I wouldn't want to be driving down the street of a drive-in movie after this ends and the kids in their cars are leaving"" Being 16 years old at the time-the reviewer was absolutely correct. VP packed them in at the drive-ins, this was still the era of big engines and cheap gas. In a few years the Arab oil embargo, sky rocketing insurance rates, and pollution regulations would cripple the Detroit's muscle car industry, but Hollywood in the early 70's still made car chase movies like ""VP,"" ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"" and ""Smoky & the Bandit"" in the tradition of Bob Mitchum's 1950's epic, ""Thunder Road"" that featured about 90 minutes of car chases weaved through a thin plot line.VP has a minuscule plot that logic totally escapes any logic:1) Kowalski is supposed to be driving this Dodge Challenger from Denver to SF for a car delivery service, presumably to someone who will take possession of a muscle car in mint condition. Kowalski completely drives the complete crap out of it, on and off road.2) Kowalski leaves Denver around midnight, but we see him driving in daylight along the breathtaking stretch of I-70 adjacent to the Colorado River in Glenwood Springs, which is only 156 mi. from Denver. Where has Kowalski been all evening? (come to think of it, the only time we see him drive at night is leaving Denver)3) We only see him stop once for gasoline. I would imagine that the 440 Magnum Dodge engine being driven at 120 mph might get 8mpg. So with a 20 gallon tank Kowalski is going to have to stop at least every hour & half. Speaking of which, why don't the police, instead of chasing him with cars, choppers and setting up roadblocks, just wait for him at the few gas stations that are few and far between in the remote sections of Ut & Nv?4) the AM radio station, KOW that has the DJ ""Supersoul"" that aids Kowalski looks like it is in a tiny town in western Nv, I would guess 100 watts, yet Kowalski is able to pick this station up quite clearly all the way from Colorado.Enough logic. great car chases. hot looking naked chick on a motorcycle shows up later for no reason. not a bad way to spend 90 minutes.",Vanishing Point
65,krdement,3 Perspectives from 1 Reviewer,7,30 August 2008,"This is the most difficult film of the dozens that I have rated on IMDb.First Perspective: I first saw this film on its initial release when I was an incipient hippie- wannabe of 17. My first car had been a Chevelle SS 396, and my second was a Firebird 400. I was accustomed to driving long distances across the arid southwest at high rates of speed. Just something you did... So, on first viewing, I loved this film and its celebration of the anti- violent, anti-racist, anti-establishment milieu of the 60's counter-culture. I loved the soundtrack. I loved the familiar scenery. I loved the car and the adrenaline rush that it provided. I loved the anti-hero, Kowalski, and I expected Barry Newman to become a big star. (He starred in a short-lived TV drama, ""Petrocelli,"" but portrayed minor characters for most of his film career.) No doubt, I also loved the rather extensive nudity.Years later, I still remembered Newman, the title of the film, and the basic theme of pursuit, but beyond that I could not recall why I had such a fond memory of this film.Second Perspective: I watched it for only the second time last night when I stumbled across it on one of the movie channels. So, I sat down and became a passenger on a personal road-trip of nostalgic curiosity. Mostly, I thought, ""I don't really get it, but it is kind of interesting"" - primarily for making me aware of a personal milieu that I had so internalized that I had long since stopped regarding it as very distinctive in any way. The anti-racism and anti-violence themes seemed pretty stereotypical and obligatory in a film of this kind. It was never clear to me why so many (mostly impassive) people would gather around the radio station and continue to hang out for a couple of days. I sat through the whole movie with a sense of how preposterous it was that Super Soul just turned the radio station into his own personal CB to talk to Kowalski. When it ended, I thought, ""I wonder what the point was - an extended car chase movie? If a point had ever been in mind, surely it had vanished... Oh, I get it... Boy, a long way to go to make a non-point!""Third Perspective: A day after seeing the movie for the second time, I turned to IMDb to see what others thought. I was quite surprised by the high rating and the number of reviews. I began to read them. Many of the positive comments I read, drug me out of my middle-aged literalistic perspective and restored my appreciation for this film and the kind of film-making it represents. It is a quest movie - the quest for freedom - and we see that in multiple characters. It is not literal, but metaphorical - symbolic to some degree, stereotypical to some degree. (But, one man's stereotype is another man's symbol.) In the context of surrealism, a car radio that talks to its driver is actually rather interesting. During the era of ""Vanishing Point,"" Hollywood made a number of very self-conscious, pseudo-intellectual attempts at depicting the contemporary culture. Most of these attempts that I have revisited in recent years are at best, laughable, and at worst, painful to watch. But this one is neither. It avoids striking that pretentious, consciously ""hip"" tone that caused its contemporaries to age so poorly.In the end, the movie achieves a curious balance. Did I like Kowalski? Yes. Was I saddened when he crashed? No. Despite the character-developing flash-backs, Kowalski was transformed from a real person with whom I might identify into some metaphor or symbol about whom I was quite dispassionate. I was merely along for an exciting ride, the end of which did not cause me the slightest bit of anticipation or suspense. Kind of like a carnival ride...My values have changed a lot since I first saw this film. I cannot accept the existentialism and nihilism that are the film's main themes. Despite the fact that these are the themes of the film, however, Vanishing Point never seems really dark or oppressive or depressing or polemical. The soundtrack is terrific and lively, providing a counterbalance to the dark themes. The racial violence is disturbing. But most of the nudity actually seemed quite ""innocent"" - even if the nude rider was an obvious symbol of freedom (or the pursuit of freedom). (Interestingly, a kind of denial of existentialism and the ethos of the era comes about when Newman declines the nude rider's implicit invitation to sex and her offer of marijuana.) Vanishing Point is absolutely remarkable for the almost complete absence of offensive language. None of the commentators I read seem to have grasped that. Almost every Hollywood film that ever portrayed the milieu portrayed in Vanishing Point (or, in fact, any anti-hero film since the release of this film) has relied on heavy doses of profanity. I submit this film as powerful evidence that such language is, indeed, gratuitous and unnecessary.After my first viewing of this film, I might have rated it higher than a 7. Immediately after my last viewing, I probably would have rated this film somewhat lower. After reading some other comments, I think it's overall rating on IMDb is about right.",Vanishing Point
66,rioplaydrum,Who Doesn't Like This Movie?,9,8 January 2017,"A stupid plot, fast cars, cops being wrecked in their own cars and motorcycles, a very cool driver, and oh,...A gorgeous naked chick on a Honda motorcycle in the middle of the desert.You can't think this stuff up! Throw in a hip black radio host and you've got it all.This is the archetypical 70's rebel movie. A Vietnam Vet and disgraced cop racing across the United States in a bad-ass car against all odds.What can go wrong? ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING!

Will always love it.",Vanishing Point
67,eyesour,Also Ran,6,14 February 2011,"Valid judgements demand constructive comparison. Like: is Anton Chigurh better or worse than the Bubonic Plague? In the case of Vanishing Point the ideal comparison is with Two-Lane Blacktop. These two films seem to have been produced at just about the same time in 1971, and they both describe an episodic road journey from somewhere to somewhere else. The road trip is actually the most ancient form of story-telling, stretching back to the Epic of Gilgamesh, about five thousand years ago. Gilgamesh and his buddy Enkidu set off in search of immortality, but don't find it.Here we see that voting on the IMDb site rates VP at 7.1 stars, and 2LBT at 7.3 stars. I submit that the gap between these two productions is infinitely greater than 0.2 stars. More like 3.5 or 4 stars. VP is not an uninteresting film, but 2LBT is an all-time great. VP features Barry Newman, hailed by the Los Angeles Times as the ""Spencer Tracy of the 80's."" Is that an enviable accolade? Barry isn't too bad in his role as a car driver. 2LBT, on the other hand, features Warren Oates, who can simply be hailed as the peerless actor, Warren Oates. Period.The episodes in VP are silly, but in 2LBT they are not. Super Soul and the undressed crumpet riding a motorbike in VP are positively Monty Python silly. The trashing of Super Soul's radio station comes out of nowhere, and is virtually inexplicable: in any case, it's not well explained. The stick-up by the queers in VP is just ridiculous; whereas the queer cowboy in 2LBT is sad and pathetic. On the other hand there's a lot of humour in 2LBT, but virtually none in VP. There are a lot of driving stunts in VP, but, in a way, when you've seen one stunt, you've seen them all. My disc omits the episode with Charlotte Rampling, but this doesn't seem to matter much. Not that I'd know.Vanishing Point is worth watching more than once, if only to help puzzle out what its pointless point is. However, unlike 2LBT, it does not improve with repeated viewings. The point seems to be that not only is life a bitch, but also a bore, and then you die. So what, precisely, is its point? Skip Easy Rider (1969). Try Five Easy Pieces (1970).",Vanishing Point
68,penseur,The car and the scenery are the stars,9,16 March 2005,"When I first saw this as a teenager in the 1970s I thought it was a great commercial for a Challenger R/T and it still is - Dodge must have been pleased. The movie owes a lot to ""Easy Rider"" and a little to ""Bullitt"" which preceded it, but it set a new benchmark for the road movie genre, one which hasn't been surpassed, although many of the elements have been copied since. The cinematography is simply beautiful, and even if you're not into cars it should be watched for its presentation of the great wide open desert areas of America. It isn't all about speed thrills, there are occasions where Kowalski slows or stops to appreciate forgotten still life and tranquility. From a social perspective it was made at the transition from the 1960s to the 1970s and captures this phase well; the idealism of the ""love, peace and good vibes"" period was being replaced with something else. I give the movie a 9 overall, it doesn't quite get a 10 because of a few elements - such as the gay robbers - which could have been dropped in favor of developing other aspects more.",Vanishing Point

From the psychopathic road-raging protagonist without a cause and without a single brain cell, to the pseudo-moralizing about the crooked cops who molest a 16-year old hitchhiker, because you know - cops are BAD (which parallels to the current anti-police and anti-policing culture) and all those Ted Bundy and Jeff Dahmer were so kind and nice to hitchhikers... to the strange radio DJ who's got ... a cut of a delivery deal, or maybe a raging hard-on for getting even with society, by proxy of the brainless driver. I'm halfway through the movie, and there's not a single redeeming character...Good gracious, if this movie represents a vicarious experience of reality many in America of the seventies wanted, and if indeed the road-rage protagonist appealed and appeared to many as ""a rebel against vacuity"" (with an even bigger vacuity in his head) then the Soviet longing for the western way of life in that time was an empty idiotic dream of delusional morons... and the modern US nostalgia for those times is very definitely NOT a good thing.",Vanishing Point
70,DaRick89,Vanishing Point is quite a flawed movie in conventional terms - but it is interesting and intriguing partially for that reason,7,1 July 2012,"Vanishing Point is a difficult film to assess in many ways. As a movie, it is quite flawed. The plot is obvious but ultimately quite shallow - centering around Kowalski trying to deliver a car across the country in record time. Kowalski's back story is hinted at, which makes the film a bit more interesting, but his back story takes up only a few minutes of the film. The characters and performances are often vacuous, failing to leave an impression. Barry Newman is the chief culprit, turning in a most colourless, emotionless performance where he personally offers little insight into his character. The exception is Cleavon Little as the hyperactive DJ Super-Soul; his interplay with Newman is novel, some of his dialogue is memorable (indeed, his rambling about Kowalski and the 'police Nazis' was quoted by Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses twenty years later) and his input gives the film some badly needed impetus. Luckily though, Vanishing Point works better on other levels. For instance, it has that early 1970's style that makes the film more compelling than it should be. Newman is chiefly responsible for this; he is certainly emotionless, but that allows him to develop an air of 'cool' that suits the film. The white Dodge Challenger is a very nice touch. The early 70's style also allows it to work as a period piece; Kowalski encounters counter-culture hippies, religious fanatics in the desert and the police. The fractious state of race relations between blacks and whites at that time is also highlighted. On the downside, it does substantially date the film. It's a cult classic for a reason; as the failed 1997 remake demonstrated, a movie like Vanishing Point would not work nearly as well in another era.It also works reasonably well as a straight driving film. The film is punctuated with enough car crashes and chases to move the film forward.However, the film's real saving grace is in its many allegories. The largely empty plot does ironically enable this, because you can read whatever you want into the film. I therefore understand why the plot is so empty, because the many allegories punctuated within the film make it intriguing to watch. For instance, why did Kowalski's face shine towards the end? Why were there so many STOP signs? Was Super-Soul a spiritual guide to Kowalski? You can also have fun inventing allegories that weren't even intended - why was the Dodge Challenger white, for example?Ultimately, Vanishing Point is not the easiest film to assess. In conventional terms, I would not rank the film particularly highly because the plot, characters, acting and dialogue are often unimpressive. As such, the casual movie viewer may not particularly identify with it. However, Vanishing Point is not a particularly conventional film; like most good films it moves itself forward well, but it is the film's style and allegorical nature that largely keeps the interest and pushes the film above the ruck of many other driving movies. I also admit that the film could not have been as effective as an allegory if the plot wasn't so insubstantial. With this in mind, I have decided to give it:3.5/5 stars",Vanishing Point
71,eti55,"Fast Cars, Misfits and Freedom",7,23 October 2013,"This is a revised review.I'll admit I wasn't sure quite what to make of this one when I first saw it. What drew me to Vanishing Point in the first place was that it was a road flick featuring a fast car..and I LOVE movies with fast cars.The premise at the beginning seems simple enough. Kowalski (Barry Newman) is a speed freak (as in drugs AND driving) who makes his living delivering cars. He's just arrived back in Denver, to the place that employs him, after a delivery, and wants to head right back out on the road again to deliver a Dodge Challenger to San Francisco. His boss pleads with him to get some rest, as does his drug dealer, but Kowalski is determined. He bets his dealer the price of the speed he just bought that he can deliver the car in 15 hours (I figured it up..he would have to average 84.5 MPH with NO stops if he drove in a straight line).Where the movie gets interesting..and disturbing..is when it gets into WHY Kowalski is so determined to go on this ride. While he's tearing down the roadway in that waaay cool white Challenger, with police hot on his tail, we see flashes of his past, including his time as a war hero in Vietnam, his stint as a police officer who stops his partner from raping a teenage girl they'd picked up (and getting kicked off the force for it); also we see that for a time he raced cars and motorcycles (crashing more than once), and he even spent a period of time as a hippie/counterculture type (where he watched his girlfriend drown in the ocean).Two dynamics emerge: First, and this was brought up in another review, Kowalski is a guy who couldn't fit in anywhere, be it the ""establishment"" or the ""counterculture."" Second, and more important, in the flashbacks we see one bad thing after another happen to him, regardless of what he was doing or who he was with. This is what his life has come down to, and it's as if this pedal-to-the-metal trip to SF, come hell or high water, is all he has left.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the other main player in this, a blind disc jockey who goes by ""Super Soul"" (Cleavon Little in what may be the finest performance of his career). Super Soul feels an instant connection with Kowalski..calling him ""the last American hero"" as he races from police on his trek. In between songs he talks to Kowalski over the airwaves as if he can sense what the doomed driver is thinking. In the midst of this a bunch of redneck bullies break into the radio station and give Super Soul a horrific beating, and the movie doesn't really explain why. Maybe it's because they didn't like what Kowalski was doing and Super Soul being sympathetic to him, aggravated by the fact that they already hated Super Soul because he was black.Vanishing Point has been compared, erroneously in my opinion, to Easy Rider. Whereas the latter is clearly a movie centering on 60s counterculture, Vanishing Point is a character study, both of Kowalski and Super Soul, two misfits..yet both honorable and decent men (perhaps that's what makes them misfits)..who seem doomed to never really belong anywhere. I guess I always kind of knew what the central theme to Vanishing Point was, and the initial review I wrote a few years back does hint at it, but doesn't say it flat out. The underlying theme to Vanishing Point is, in a word, freedom. As screwed up as Kowalski's life has been, he's living whatever he has left of it on his own terms (this is why Super Soul called Kowalski the last American hero). It's also a sort of requiem for the days gone by for fast cars and open roads in America. This is not a pleasant movie..it's dark, depressing and surreal (very 70s)..but interesting. And Kowalski drives one VERY cool..and fast..car.",Vanishing Point
72,michaeljharvey,Great chase movie and character study,8,1 September 2008,"Vanishing Point gives us the story of Kowalski, a former professional race driver now working as a driver delivering cars across the desert of the American west. He makes a bet with his friend he can deliver his latest car to San Francisco in a ridiculously short amount of time and hits the road at a breakneck pace. When the cops first try to pull him over for speeding, he refuses, and an epic chase is on.At first the film seems to be a mindless action flick with our hero using spectacular driving to elude his pursuers. However, as the movie progresses, we begin to get details about Kowalski's life. He's a Vietnam vet and presumably saw some terrible things in combat during the war. At one time he was a police officer, only to be disgraced in a public scandal. The only woman he ever loved, perhaps the only person who gave him a reason to go on, drowned in a surfing accident. His career as a racer was a dismal failure.He's lead a difficult life and we begin to question his motivations for taking the bet. Why risk everything, even his life, to win a ridiculous wager with a friend? What's the point in delivering a car if it's practically destroyed? It becomes clear that Kowalski doesn't really care if he destroys the car, or even himself, during his journey. He's a man who's reached the end of his rope. He's lived life on the edge of society and it has taken a terrible toll on him. His fiery, suicidal crash at the conclusion of the film is not all that surprising. He knew all along this would be his final drive.The simplistic plot of the film is bolstered by the many quirky characters he meets along the way. There's a blind DJ, an eccentric old man wandering the desert, gay highway robbers, a naked motorcycle girl, a Christian snake-handling cult... These characters all add texture to an already rich story. Given the minimal dialog he had to work with, Barry Newman gives a great understated performance as Kowalski. This is the story of one man's death, but it is also a story about a dying part of America. Wide-open roads in the West, unlimited possibilities and idealism, the dream of making it to California... all of these things disappeared decades ago.This is a great 70's cult classic. While some aspects of the film seem dated, Vanishing Point is still more creative and progressive than many movies being produced now.",Vanishing Point
73,tom-darwin,Can you ever build enough speed on the road to escape your past & your pain?,7,7 April 2006,"""Vanishing Point"" asks the question and, like other films of this kind before ""Smokey & the Bandit"" brought the genre to an end, lets us ponder the answer on our own. Other than that, there's no point to this film except to demonstrate that the Challenger is one of the best-looking muscle/sports cars ever made. Get too far into this movie & you'll want to sell your children to have one. Kowalski is a '70s knight-errant, or a Greek mythological hero, just as you please. He rides his Hemi-powered steed on a quest to San Francisco, not for a ""what,"" or a ""why,"" or even for a lady fair, but only for ""how fast."" Does he seek redemption? Escape? Self-forgiveness? To stick it to the Man? Who cares? Knavish cops close in on him, lotus-eaters like Hovah (Darden) shun him, sirens (especially the stark-naked Texter, who would've stopped Burt Reynolds's Bandit faster than Sally Field ever did) want him to dally. Sharp-featured, Western character actor Anthony James has a hilarious, uncharacteristic turn as a gay hitchhiker. Humble, noble souls come forth to guide Kowalski like angels, including a scruffy snake-hunter (Jagger), chopper jockey & drug dealer Angel (Scott), and the blind deejay Super Soul (Little, who should've been a contender for the part of Howard Beal in ""Network""). The Man's attempts to explain Kowalski are annoying distractions, so hit the ""mute"" button when you see scenes of cops in offices. And stop wondering why Kowalski, on his quest for speed, is always being overtaken & passed by other vehicles. Just put your brain in neutral, put your popcorn where it's handy, and buckle up.",Vanishing Point
74,rspress,Great Cult Flick!,8,31 March 2006,"If there is one thing about the film Vanishing Point it is that people have always tried to read a lot of meaning as to what it is really about. This is one of the great things about the film. One might say it is a blank canvas that you can paint your own meaning into. That said, I will try to give you what I think the film is about. More than anything I think it is about the death of the sixties. Where the 60's were about peace, love and understanding this films shows that these are pretty much dead in the 70's. In fact you could say that this film was way ahead of its time and was pretty much right on the money. This film really gave birth to the 70's car flicks. Just about all 70's car flicks owe it to this film for really setting the standard that they never lived up to. Do yourself a favor and stay away from the lame remake of this film. It is not worth the film it was shot on and it was like they never saw the original movie. If they did they never got it.",Vanishing Point
75,djensen1,Not just motor pulp,7,10 December 2007,"What may seem at first to be just so much car stunt schlock turns out actually to be a rather fascinating meditation on motivation. Barry Newman is great as Kowalski, a sketchy character who drives cars cross-country. We learn little about him, and only slowly and in jumbled bits, as he tries to deliver a white Challenger from Denver to San Francisco. Starting out Friday at nearly midnight, Kowalski tries to do the run by Saturday at 3 o'clock for unspecified reasonsthe car doesn't have to be there until Monday, and we're given to understand that Kowalski is really running away from his screwed-up life. Newman looks right as the present-day, haggard Kowalski, yet is perfect as the fresh-faced uniformed cop he was in his youth and the car and motorcycle racer he was after he fell from grace.What could have been monotonous driving-and-thinking or mind-numbing crash after crash is deftly handled by director Sarafian in a balanced mix of stunts and interludes. Cleavon Little does most of Kowalski's talking for him as the exuberant DJ Super Soul, but Newman owns the screen, reacting subtly to the lunatic world he's passing thru and barely a part of anymore. Some of the music is pretty lame 70s hippie rock, which is too bad, since a great soundtrack probably would have elevated this to true classic status.The DVD includes both the US and UK releases, the difference being a brief sequence in which Kowalski picks up Charlotte Rampling as a mysterious hitchhiker. This is a little too on-the-nose for my taste and seems to be aping Ingmar Bergman, but the movie plays fine with or without it.",Vanishing Point
76,epsilon3,Almost....,7,9 December 2002,"As a fan of 70's movies I was really looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I was let down by a few things.The acting is reasonable, but with so little script, there's little characterisation to latch onto. I understand that the main character Kowalski is supposed to be a loner and doesn't say much, but if this is the case, the supporting characters need to bring something more to proceedings. As it stands, the only other character worthy of note is Super Soul and and although he does an adequate job of playing the stereotypical soulman, it's not enough.I like films with a plot. I don't mind if it's drawn out or confusing as long as it's there and it makes me think. This movie so wants to be deep, and yet it fails. The idea that Kowalski is a symbol of freedom is all well and good, but since what he's doing is pointless and benefits nobody, how is he free? Because he decides to drive dangerously fast so he can get a better deal on some drugs when he gets home? I don't have a problem with the pro-drugs nature of the movie, but as for a statement of freedom, I don't see it. Lets say he runs over someone and kills them - how is he free?
In reading the reviews here, many people seem to have misinterpreted the meaning of this film. To me, it's more of a statement of a man's reaction against his despair at the downturn in his life. He feels so isolated and ruined - his previous jobs were ace racing driver and top cop and now he's a lowly car delivery man. He goes on one final pointless race, but this time it's against the world (hence his last self destructive act.)
It's one final act of defiance against a life with a rapidly vanishing point (hence the title in case you're not paying attention.) If it is to do with freedom, it's only in that he frees himself from his miserable life.Even if this is the meaning behind it (if there is one at all) the film doesn't deal with it very well.Likewise, the characters he meets along the way are woefully underused. The religious cult has little point (apart from perhaps symbolising the breakdown of traditional religious beliefs) and only just makes it onto the screen before its gone again. The two homosexuals he picks up on the road are disposed of before we know anything about them. The police officers are just stupid planks for him to run off the road a la Smokie and the Bandit. The traveling dude who collects snakes - he barely even had a chance to establish a character before he's gone again. The nude motorcycle rider - let's face it - she was just there for us guys to look at (not that I mind, but why not give her a reason to be there rather than some contrived idea that Kowalski rescued her when she was a kid?)On the plus side, I did enjoy the car chases, although considering they're the main focus of the film, they weren't even as good as those in other movies (Bullitt, French Connection etc.) Likewise, the music was good, but not great. What I did like a lot was the fact that this is a period piece - it personifies a time when the hippy movement was breaking down and society was in a state of flux. It's stylised in a way that I really enjoyed and at times reminded me of Duel or more applicably Easy Rider.To sum up, if you're a fan of 70's movies - this one could be for you. If you enjoyed Easy Rider, this isn't anywhere near as good but is well worth a look. Not a classic, but very interesting.",Vanishing Point

It certainly made an impression on my 15 y.o. mind! Being that young, I could not grasp all the symbolism of the movie, although I certainly ""got"" the young lady on the motorcycle! At the time, the speed and power of the Dodge Challenger R/T was really something to see, and it is still as enjoyable today, as it was back then. This movie is The Mother of all Chase Movies.

The only thing that kept me awake was the naked girl on motorcycle. Even the car chase sequences were bland. If you're looking for a car chase movie from that era, try Bullit or The French Connection. Maybe I'm missing the whole 'Lone Wolf/Rebel' bit, I dunno.

81,Apollyon_Crash,Look back on your life torn asunder...then throw it into third gear and floor it.,10,2 April 2004,"Barry Newman is ""Kowalski"", an enigmatic figure who has tried everything in his life from stock car racing to the military, and failed at every one of his endeavors. Working as an auto delivery man, he gets an order to transport a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T to San Francisco, and makes a bet with a few friends that it can be done in an impossibly short time. After loading up on ""ups"" and throttling the car westward, he is soon pursued vigorously by the police and embraced by the public as something of a hero. During a time when national speed limits were all controversy, this film provides a compelling argument against them: A fast car in the hands of a capable driver is not dangerous. Even the police, so caught up in their own system, don't realize that they are the only ones causing accidents and endangering the public while blindly trying to keep up with and capture Kowalski.While the film sounds at first to be a simple action film, it's really much more than that. Kowalksi's past is revealed little by little through flashbacks, making the film something of a character study. Kowalski's trip becomes a road trip of existentialism as he runs across various strange characters: Solitary hippies, gay bandits, a boogie-woogie snake handling Christian cult, and the blind soul station DJ (brilliantly played by Cleavon Little) who is attempting to guide him on his journey from within the car's radio.Topping it off is a great soundtrack, breathtaking cinematography and direction, and automotive action that has seen no equal.

It is not supposed to make sense and I have often wondered if it were not meant to be someone's psychedelic dream. Nudity when nudity would not seem to fit; bad cops; beaten people out of sync with plot line. Sounds like a trip. The cast is excellent and this is one of Cleavon Little's last main roles as well as the last main role for the early love interest. John Amos is so underplayed he is almost unrecognizable, I'd love to see his commentary on the movie. And one guy is so ripping off James Dean (though as a racist) that it is unintentionally funny.

84,tehck,It was just cool,6,19 March 2010,"When I was in high school back in 1971, my friends and I spent many of our Friday and Saturday nights at the drive-in theater, which is where and when I first saw Vanishing Point. We saw it once, and then we went to see it again a couple of weeks later and probably again when it came back the next year (as movies did at the drive-in). We weren't interested in probing its symbolism or considering how it reflected the tensions in American society or represented the quest for individual freedom. We just thought it was cool as hell, no doubt because we unconsciously responded to all its symbolic and ideological underpinnings, superficial and obvious as they may be. Back then, I had a fairly powerful emotional response to Vanishing Point but not so much now. I've seen it a couple of times in the last ten or twelve years, and I was much more aware of its weaknesses. I still enjoyed it, but its only real emotional or intellectual impact on me was one of nostalgia. However, I saw it again tonight in HD (March 2010), and the thing that really stood out was just how bad-ass that Challenger still looks. In the midst of all those other boxy, awkward, top-heavy early 70s American cars was this incredibly lithe and stylish vehicle that appears futuristic even today. Indeed, I think it looks better and more ""modern"" than the brand new retro-challenger currently in production. That beautiful muscle car and those all-natural naked hippie chicks have held up pretty damned well. Now if we could just bring back the drive-ins . . .",Vanishing Point
85,saketrick,Wow.,8,28 February 2007,"This is the best $5 I will ever spend. Thank you, Wal Mart.The disc I purchased has both US and UK versions. The UK version is the only one I've seen (it's about 6 minutes longer.) I'm a huge fan of movies coming from the late sixties and early seventies. Cool Hand Luke, for instance - is probably my favorite movie of all time.This is a movie about an ex-cop turned speedracer who gets washed up, and ends up working for a car delivery service. His best friend is his 'up' dealer, and his name is Kowolski, first last and only.Vanishing Point doesn't take very long to jump into its plot as Kowolski is given the task of delivering a 'Challenger' to Frisco (San Francisco), and then buys a handful of ups/speed from his buddy, making a bet that he can make it to Frisco by the very next day in the process.Although Kowolski is in fact a very 'cool' and clever guy who's fun to watch, the drive of this movie essentially comes from the music, and a blind African American DJ named Super Soul. Just about every word that comes out of this characters mouth is pure greatness. ""The question is not where he'll be stopped, but who will stop him."" - This quote (which may not be exact) in relationship with the ending of this movie, and the look on Super Souls face in reaction to it .. is profound.Kowolski is being chased by the law. Helicopters, camped cruisers, and a whole office of people working to track his very location. ""And there goes the Challenger"" shouts Super, ""being chased by the blue, blue meanies on wheels! The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver, the last American hero, the electric centaur, the, the demi-god, the super driver of the golden west!"" - This is a movie about someone who once lived their dream, and then lost that life .. who finds himself one day trying desperately to get it back. On his journey, he encounters a thrill-seeking porsche, a self-actualized snake-catching prospector, and a couple of hippie's, one of whom is a naked chick on a motorcycle.Does he win the bet, or is he stopped in his tracks?

That's not what this movie is about.This movie is about emotion. It's about being able to live the fantasy - for an hour and a half - of what you wish you could have done every time those damn flashing blue lights appeared in your mirror. (Note that some say that this movie served as the inspiration for the great Cannonball open-road races.)It's also about a lot of other things, like choices we make, freedom, the clash of subcultures, what constitutes good and evil - and how they can get confused, especially in a period of deep cultural change. It's about the sixties, and the question of good and bad, and how did drugs go from being the symbol and instrument of love and liberation to the destructive force they are today. It's about love, and striving, and desperation, and loss.It's a celebration of the muscle car, and the open road, and at the same time it's about social issues of the time and of all time: it juxtaposes racism and hypocrisy in religion against gorgeous music (including gospel), compassion, integrity, and vision. It even touches on homophobia.But mostly this is a movie about the joy of the open road and the ecstasy of a wide open throttle and the music of a big block at full song - and about a society that offered those joys with one hand and reached out with the other to try to destroy those who couldn't, or wouldn't, resist those temptations.It's a movie about rebellion.

Besides, after watching the original Inglorious Bastards I left any hope of figuring what the guy was made of.) But it was Tarantino's words so I was obsessed, even possessed by the idea of watching this movie. And OMG! I couldn't believe it! It's amazing, I felt myself behind that wheel, driving, driving, driving the he*l out of the car, the road, everything! It is so breathtaking just to drive pass all the barriers and lines. I hate being stopped by traffic lights, by speed limits, by some slow-ass upfront, by idiots crossing the street where they feel like, not where are supposed to according to the law, it is so unbelievable to drive beyond all that!!! I remember when I first drove in town, I couldn't believe this new feeling, the feeling of going fast, the feeling of being FREE, of being ALIVE. I really felt that I had never lived before. The instructor told me not to floor the gas, but I didn't feel like flooring it, so I told him so, after a couple of times he gave up and said: ""Ok, FLOOR IT!!!"". I took it as a licence to kill. After the ride there was all the lectures and shouts about security and other boring stuff, but then I just was FREE!!! The cops stopped someone and were checking him, the instructor went pale and informed me that he washed his hands and if anything happened I should talk to the cops myself. We flew right past them, they didn't even notice. I was too happy to care! I figure had something happened then, like an accident, I'd have died happy.I loved watching that movie, I loved that Kowalski had that feeling for the entire ride, for hours, the feeling of true happiness and joy. Outdriving and outsmarting the cops and anybody else who tried to challenge his skills and FREEDOM. He didn't really hurt anyone, but the society (the cops) tried to bring him down. Just being a free individual you're committing a crime against society. He's a true hero.I so much loved the ending, even though I cried, I know that Kowalski at that moment was the happiest man in the world!!! A free soul.

The sound it makes is unbelievable, and the car is slipping and sliding all over the road (and sometimes offroad).The movie in itself isn't bad either. In the beginning you see a part of the end of the movie, but you don't see the ending of that sequence.

91,AdamKey,A Dirge For A Dying America,10,21 February 2004,"Richard Sarafian's 1971 film ""Vanishing Point"" is, for starters, a fascinating study of those persons anthropologists sometimes term ""marginal men""--individuals caught between two powerful and competing cultures, sharing some important aspects of both but not a true part of either, and, as such, remain tragically confined to an often-painful existential loneliness. Inhabiting a sort of twilight zone between ""here"" and ""there,"" a sort of peculiar purgatory, these restless specters cannot find any peace or place, so they instead instinctively press madly on to some obscure and unknown destination, the relentless journey itself being the only reason and justification. Disc jockey Super Soul (Cleavon Little) and delivery driver Kowalski (Barry Newman) are two of these specters, marginal but decent, intelligent men who can't or won't live in burgeoning competing cultures which in reality have offered them very little of worth or substance, despite their own personal sacrifices. Kowalski himself had tried to ""fit in"" with the Establishment as a soldier and police officer and later, attempted to do the same with the blossoming 1960s counterculture, but soon disappointingly found that they both were ridden with their own various forms of dishonesty and insincerity. Personal honor, self-reliance and genuine respect--Kowalski's stock in trade--were tragically valued very little by either, despite each one's shrill and haughty claims to the contrary. Moreover, it's no accident Newman's character has a Polish surname; the Poles throughout their history have created a very rich and unique Slavic culture largely based upon just such a ""marginality""--being geographically jammed between powerful historic enemies, Germany and Russia, and never being able to fully identify with either one, at often great cost to themselves. It's also no accident Little's character is blind and black, the only one of his kind in a small, all-Caucasian western desert town--his sightlessness enhancing his persuasiveness and his ability to read Kowalski's mind, the radio microphone his voice, his race being the focus of long simmering and later suddenly explosive disdain--all of the characteristics of a far-seeing prophet unjustly (but typically) dishonored in his own land. The desert environment also plays a key role in cementing the personal relationship between and respective fates of these two men--to paraphrase British novelist J.G. Ballard, prophets throughout our history have emerged from deserts of some sort since deserts have, in a sense, exhausted their own futures (like Kowalski himself had already done) and thus are free of the concepts of time and existence as we have conventionally known them (as Super Soul instinctively knew, thus creating his own psychic link to the doomed driver.) Everything is somehow possible, and yet, somehow nothing is. Finally, VP is also a ""fin de siecle"" story, a unique requiem for a quickly dying age- a now all-but-disappeared one of truly open roads, endless speed for the joy of speed's sake, of big, solid no-nonsense muscle cars, of taking radical chances, of living on the edge in a colorful world of endless possibility, seasoned with a large number and wide variety of all sorts of unusual characters, all of which had long made the USA a wonderful place--and sadly is no longer, having been supplanted by today's swarms of sadistic, military-weaponed cop-thugs, obsessive and intrusive safety freaks, soulless toll plazas, smug yuppie SUV drivers, tedious carbon-copy latte towns, and a childish craving for perfect, high-fuel-efficiency safety and security. The just-issued DVD contains both the US and UK releases of the film; the UK release, I believe, is a much more satisfying film, as it has the original scenes deleted from the US version. As an aside, Super Soul's radio station call letters, KOW, are in fact the ones for a country & western station in San Diego.",Vanishing Point
92,nj2,Maybe I just don't get it..,4,27 June 2011,"Maybe I just don't get it, but from my point of view this sorry effort managed to match the stupidity of today's Hollywood CGI fests, which is quite rare for an early 70s film.Nothing of it made much sense. You see some slightly strange looking guy driving around, meeting characters seemingly taken straight from a bad comic book with totally artificial and unbelievable dialog, plus whacked out sequences apparently written while being high on heaven knows what. Worst of all was the black DJ - incredibly annoying.And the car chases weren't that impressive either, especially compared to other movies of that era. Most of the time the cars were going pretty slow with the impression of speed achieved through various tricks. This is common today but it wasn't back then. I would've expected at least a few short scenes with the Dodge going 100-150 mph, speeds I regularly drive on the Autobahn.

100,MBCD,"An interesting ""film"" disguised as a crappy 70s ""movie""",9,28 September 2005,"VP is basically the product of a high-concept existential art film getting hastily re-cut into a crappy B-movie at the last minute. The results, strangely enough, are maybe better than either one of them intended.If VP had been allowed to finish as a full-blown ""artsy"" film, it would probably have been a little cheesy & clumsy by modern standards. There are enough heavy-handed moments in it to make me wonder about how much better the creators' lost original version would really have been if it was seen through modern eyes. But with the studio trying to silence the deeper aspects of VP in the editing room, it takes on a whole new feeling that may have helped it age better than most of the other similar works from the time period. It never reveals any specific message/meaning that you could categorize & describe, but you always get the strong feeling that you didn't get it all. It's maybe not as obvious as scenes being cut in half or anything . . . but it sort of feels like they shot several different versions of each dialog scene during production, and this version you're watching is always the ""short, B-movie"" one. It makes you wonder what else might be in a can somewhere in a vault at 20th Century-Fox. And like a lot of art forms, it can be a lot more fun to wonder about what's missing than just watching what's there to see.VP is much more memorable than the sum of its parts.",Vanishing Point
101,rkbyers,The Point Beyond Existence,10,11 March 2006,"Others have suggested that the only symbolism worth mentioning, in this movie, is in the title. What is the point beyond which it is pointless to exist? Our hero, Kowalski, is trying to find out. He makes piecemeal efforts at existing and only succeeds in self-destructing. Clearly, his life once had promise and meaning, but the death of his girlfriend haunts him. Kowalski asks the question of God: ""Why?"" The response is like a Samuel Beckett play. Kowalski is just existing, biding his time, waiting for life to give him one more thing to which he can react. He has lost his will to be pro-active. He has lost his will to live. Each time I watch this movie I am stunned with the degree of nihilism and anti-authoritarianism it represents. Freedom is almost described as ""doing one's own thing"" as opposed to selling out to the establishment. In truth, freedom is a good deal more difficult and a great deal quieter. It isn't the person who goes down in a blaze of glory who is the hero as much as it is the one who has the courage to carry on in life.The thrill of speed was unparalleled in those days, but that requires some explanation. No one who drove quickly in the 60's and 70's could fail to remember the sound of the big 440 Mopar when the secondaries kicked in. The 440 was such a torque monster that it was difficult to run away from it, even in those big boxy sedan bodies. Cars didn't handle nearly as well as they do now and the tires were considerably worse. If you were traveling 125 mph in a street car, you were traveling very quickly. In fact, most times, it bordered on insanity.The 440 cop cars, by the way, could top out at around 140. The light bar added a lot of drag on the top end and you could pull away slightly above 100, if your car was so disposed. The Challenger had an advantage, to be sure being smaller, lighter and more aerodynamic, but not nearly as much as one would think. Even the vaunted 426 Hemi wouldn't have made a lot of difference in this case. Despite what one might suspect would be a tremendous speed advantage, on an open and straight road, it's doubtful that a better engine and better car would run away from a cop. The tricks from this movie usually resulted in someone turning his car over. The State Highway Patrol, at very least, knew how to handle those cars pretty well. I am impressed at how well the movie turns Kowalski into a hero and the law into Nazis. We all like Kowalski: he is a decent guy, even helping the queers when their car broke down. (By the way, at the time, that scene served as great comic relief.) But the larger question is this: who pushed Kowalski into this corner? In reality, how would you like your son or daughter killed because some guy was racing his car on the street just on a bet?He is a likable character for whom life has gone very wrong. Kowalski doesn't like that life is as hard and apparently nasty as it is. I hope we all share that with him. However, Benzedrine isn't a way of seeing clearly: it's a way of obscuring the reality with a rush. It really does give one the feeling of invincibility and superiority. It exacts a terrible price on the body and mind. The ""Vanishing Point"" is that point at which life ceases to be of value to oneself. One might argue that Kowalski had already reached that point before the chase began. Suicide isn't the lack of options in one's life as much as it is the failure to recognize that there are viable options. God might have had something else in mind for the Kowalskis in this life, but they may choose not to listen, or, worse, no longer be able to listen. The Christian symbolism throughout the movie seems anti-climactic in some ways. In several ways, it is man's involvement with God's word that gets in the way of God's own message. The humans who call themselves Christians in this movie don't seem much better of than Kowalski is and maybe even a bit worse. It looks like Christianity is in opposition to what people find pleasing in this world. Mark Twain made roughly the same point in Letters from the Earth. When God does not make life the way we want it, then we aren't going to play by His rules. Each of has this choice, as Camus said in the opening lines of The Stranger. Kowalski gives up because he is hurt. Each of us has been there. Dealing with things our own way usually leads us to ruin. Kowalski is hurting too much to see any other options. The pain is too great for him to stand. Giving in to God seems like giving in to everything else, like giving up. He sees that going out in the blaze of glory as the only honest thing left to do. Frankly, I hope viewers see that as a drug-infused (excuse the pun) cop out. It's a lot harder to live than it is to die.",Vanishing Point
102,Spanky-43,"Not just a film, a life experience",8,10 September 1999,"I once drove from Albany to Niagara Falls in a day, on roads that just kept on going, seemingly without end - not something we get a lot of in the UK - and I was changed by the experience of driving in this massive country, knowing that it didn't have to stop there, I could have kept on going.Watching Vanishing Point I got a similar feeling, driving in isolation, the call of the open road. Of course, you end up having too much time to think about life and past regrets when you are driving for that long, and that for me is the attraction of this film. Kowalski is driving to escape his past, but no matter how fast he drives his past continues to haunt him - listen to the conversation he has about driving to San Francisco - no-one can drive that distance in that short a time.By choosing to have no companion for Kowalski, the director avoids useless banter, the engine noise is the dialogue. Of course, a film with just a guy driving down a road would be quite dull, so we are given some interludes of Kowalski meeting other people as real life interrupts his introspection, but in the end he decides his own destiny.P.S. The car chases are cool too!!",Vanishing Point
103,supersixman,"I think I only ""got"" half of it...",4,23 February 2005,"I'd often heard about this movie from the muscle car fan world. And when it comes to muscle cars, a lot of this film lives up to its billing as a spectacular car chase movie. This film delivers cubic inches of muscle car action, as Kowalski (Barry Newman) jumps his '70 Dodge Challenger across washouts, dices with a trashy looking Jaguar, and battles the police on and off the road, all the while wearing a rather disturbed expression. Great stuff. Unfortunately, the film uses up most of its gas and rubber in the first hour, and the rest seems to be about Kowalski's interaction with the various characters he meets on the road.Unfortunately, this is where I don't really get the movie. Some of the characters are pretty straightforward, but most of the people Kowalski meets are mid-bogglingly weird. People show up, say their part, and disappear for the rest of the movie, leaving the viewer to try and make sense of the things they've said. The movie's sense of pacing doesn't help much - it seems to be a bit off many times, and often there is no sense of tension where there ought to be. And sometimes the film suggested something terrible was going to happen... and then nothing occurred. To its credit, though, the very unpredictability of the supporting cast can really keep you on your toes. There were quite a few times when the action took a twist that there was no way I could have expected.I guess I don't really get all the existentialism behind this film. The chase scenes do get the adrenaline flowing, but I found a lot of the film could sometimes border on the unwatchable.",Vanishing Point
104,EbrosTheMonk,More than just a car chase flick.,10,22 May 2003,"This movie held me spellbound the first time I saw it and is still capable of this after countless viewings.  This is more than just a car chase movie, it actually has depth and a story to tell.  The scenery of the great American West is also first rate and the soundtrack never fails to set the mood.**THIS PARAGRAGH MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS** The story of the main character, an auto delivery driver named Kowalski unfolds as he takes delivery of a white '70 Dodge Challenger which is as he puts it `souped up to 160' and proceeds to drive it from Denver to San Francisco.  His plan, however is to do this in 15 hours to win a bet.  As Kowalski makes his journey his life is revealed to us through flashbacks and recollections which are usually triggered by what is currently happening to him in real time.  Through these the viewer learns that despite his apparent lawless behavior, Kowalski is a man of good character.  One of the big things that drew me into this movie is that it doesn't hand you the explanations on a silver platter. Instead it allows you to think about it and draw your own conclusions long after you've seen it.  Certain other reviewers here have already done a great job of touching on the philosophies of freedom and individualism prevalent in this movie, so I won't waste the time trying to top those.  I'll add that I feel this is a type of an expressionist film.  Kowalski is kind of an `Everyman' (I think people can relate to him) who is on a journey to find his place in the grand scheme of things.  Along his path he encounters various characters that watch over him and help him along, but there are also those who wish to shut him down.  Whether you think the conclusion of Kowalski's journey is successful or not is up to you.Another big plus is the realism in the driving scenes, where the drivers are actually driving their machines and occasionally things happen like tires going flat or the car needs fuel.  Most modern car chase sequences leave me wanting with all of the computer generated car moves and general lack of realism (no, you can't shoot a car repeatedly with a .50 calibre machine gun without harming the occupants or engine).  I know they sometimes got it wrong back then too, doing things like obviously speeding the film up. In this one though, they got it right.  The driving here brings us into that realm of manhandling 4000 lbs. of American Iron, in all the glory of big-block V8 roar, screaming smoking tires, and hands flying over the steering wheel.Another thing that's cool to me about this type of movie is the appearance of the car.  At the beginning, the car is resplendent in gleaming chrome and white paint.  As the story moves along, the car gradually gets a more dusty battered countenance.  I won't spoil the end, but those who've seen it know.The final things that tie this whole thing together are the soundtrack and scenery.  They seem to go hand in hand, from the upbeat rock & roll as Kowalski starts out to the stirring guitar strains during the thoughtful moments.  I also cannot say enough about the scenery, which really sucks the viewer in.  It ranges from the mountains of Colorado, across Utah and into the searing Nevada desert.In closing, I'll say that this is one of my favorite movies.  It won't be understood by everyone, but those of us who fantasize about getting in a classic car and blasting down an open two-lane highway devoid of SUV's, sport sedans and minivans will likely get it.",Vanishing Point

However, somehow, I got it. Not the 'religious"" symbolism, but the fact that I was seeing - no - experiencing a counter-culture film. As an 8 yr. old, it FELT like what I later found out it was supposed to be; a cool, hip, statement on the after-effects of the late '60's turmoil.Throughout the next 30 years, because the movie did not raise a fuss, I felt like it was MY cool secret - just me and my Dad. I could vividly remember many scenes in my head (in my 20's and 30's) without ever seeing the movie again.A film that enters your head off and on for 30+ years after seeing it once as a small child, is a testament to the power of a great film.

Films that raise questions and make you think. Based in the exciting 70s, this is about a car driver who, on a whim, bets that he can make it from Denver to San Fransisco in 15 hours. He loads up on speed and heads west. In the raging spirit of the 70s, the same spirit that accompanied Easy Rider and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, he races against the law for what is right; what this reviewer believes is the American Dream. He is helped along the way by an apparently psychic radio DJ, a naked girl on a motorcycle (one of the most beautiful and purely free images I have ever seen), a hippie, along with several other miscreants that the society at the time considered bad. The story is as much about the rebellion and the characters he meets on the way as it is the chase itself. The film manages to beautifully capture every facet of the experience, from the monotony of the drive to the excitement of the chase to the fear of defeat.So, for those looking for what is perhaps the ultimate chase movie, this is it.

That stretch of highway was two-lane then, but now is superslabbed throughout the canyon.Also note an appearance by longtime Denver TV newsman Bob Palmer, who interviews Sandy about ""the Kowalski saga.""

He's a Vietnam War vet – from a very disillusioned early 70's perspective anyone involved in that conflict is a loser. He's a failed police officer (incidentally it says he was a detective – does a detective wear a uniform? He does if he's loser). He's a failure in love – his girlfriend dies in a bizarre surfing accident while he rests on the shore. He's a failed racing driver although his friend would have the world believe he was the best only he never won anything. He's a failed gambler – can't even win his bet to drive his car to San Francisco due to an unfortunate bulldozer incident. He's a failure in friendship and morality. His best friend (the one he makes his last telephone call to) is a drug dealer. Remember Kowalski used to be a constable. He knows the damage drugs can do. So we see him at one point protecting a girl from rape and in the next discussing girls with his drug dealer mate.

Sure, there's a lot of depth and all that jazz, but I won't go into it right now. I think the viewer's should make of it what they want... all in all, this is a great movie with great production and great acting is is great on the whole. And that car- how can anyone not love the sound and fury of a 440ci V8 under the twin-scooped hood?",Vanishing Point
120,qshipaz,You can't be inspired by the end... or can you?,9,8 May 2007,"It's predictable, the way VP ends... you can't find it cheery to see how he finally got to the end. Doesn't somehow mean it is not inspirational.I like the Charlotte Rampling scenes; I think that's actually some of the best parts in the film. I've heard her described as symbolizing Death itself- it fits. Her on screen presence is chilling. Weirdest part: Kowalski wakes up, presumably in a dawn weed hangover, and he is alone. Where did she go? His bet is lost. What is the hurry? Nonetheless, he's off like a cannon shot, again.And that, simple minded as it is, is how one feels inspired by watching the movie. Speed, for its own sake, has a peculiar draw. I know the morning after i watched this, I had to go to work on a Saturday morning. This is unusual for me, I typically face a M-F grind. I got to ride on ten miles of highway which is usually clogged with commuters. It was wide open road, 75 degrees, sunny. I made a joyful noise with my exhausts and went up the road at warp speed. FREEEEDOM! One doesn't have to be morose and death-obsessed to want to attain a simply absurd rate of speed. I once ran into an old acquaintance who I had not seen in ten years; he quoted, verbatim, a challenge I suggested in the middle '90s. Start in Tucson, aim for the Tempe city limits; after you start your engine, switch on the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street. If you make it before the album's done, you're doing well.The distance is 97 miles; the album is 67:17. Good luck.How is this different from betting a handful of pills against a (very real) threat of death as in VP? It's exactly the same. Yet the fact that I suggested it forever stuck in this guy's mind; this film has a similar singularity. I really think it's a better take on the Easy Rider idea.",Vanishing Point
121,everyonedoesit-1,Kowalski and the Challenger,9,22 July 2006,"Having a dull day? Rent Vanishing Point. This movie takes you on a ridiculous trip through Denver, Utah, Nevada and California from behind the wheel of a 1970 Dodge Challenger, definitely one of the iconic muscle cars from the era. The driver, Kowalski, although very quiet forms a very strong relationship with the viewer as he careens us through twisty canyon and dead straight desert roads, all the while being pursued by southern police, who don't seem to enjoy this speed demon flailing through their territory. Super Soul is the local radio DJ who pretty much gives the energy the movie needs to not be a sole-car-chase film. His hippity-hop music gives a continuing relationship to the chases and scenes in the film, and gives it a kinda folky (almost 1970s...suprise!) feel. Definitely worth buying/renting, especially if you're the kind of person who likes hurtling metal down roads.",Vanishing Point
122,Nostrom,A lost generation drives very fast,10,12 February 2003,"Vanishing Point and Dirty Harry both focus on the place for traditional male roles in society in the face of a cultural revolution which lashed out at the traditional white male. dirty Harry strikes out at what he considers the perverions of society including sexual freedom and the cowardice of the peace movement.Kowalski, the hero of Vanishing Point, merely buys alot of Metha-amphetamine and picks up a super-charged 440 Chrysler to drive from Denver to San Francisco non-stop. A feat which he is told is impossible. In the thinnest story line ever his reason for doing this is because ""He must be back by three."" That's it for the story so nothing has been lost by telling you.
It's the journey in which Kowalski stumbles across his past, which is important. It seems that Kowaski has never failed to be the hero. He has done all the things that should be considered good in society and followed his own morals, but finds that his morals are left behind by society's ethics. In the end, Kowalski comes to the realization that he lost himself through irrelevance and he ceases to be. (The Camaro which slams into the highway scraper, I think is supposed to be the Challenger.) All in all, it's a great film. It has great bit parts, and it's sense of listlessness sums up a generation lost by change, whose story was then and is now, was and is considered irrelevant.",Vanishing Point

125,cherlynnb,Anyone else see this,10,26 September 2007,I first saw this movie in early 1970's It was the second flick following American Grifitti. I could almost swear that I saw a different ending at that time than the one that is now on the film. The one I saw was as Newman is approaching the town and bulldozer road block he just suddenly disappear. They wait for him to come up the road but it never happens. the cops and copters just can't find him. He goes into a different dimension. Thus the title of the film Vanishing Point. He just reaches it finally. Did anyone else see that version. Or did my husband and I dream it up.

126,frankdenet,More than just an exciting car chase movie,8,6 October 2013,"I saw Vanishing Point when it was first released in the seventies. It is in re-play now on Sundance possibly because of the recent death of it's director. When first released it was an immediate counter-culture hit. Yes, the chase sequences are exciting and well-done, but the context may be difficult for younger viewers to get. It is shown in flashbacks that the anti-hero Kowalski is a decorated but disaffected Vietnam vet and former cop, who prevents another policeman from raping a suspect, a beautiful young girl, and is then discharged from the force. He then becomes a stunt driver and high- speed car delivery driver. He is part of a generation of people who felt betrayed by a corrupt system and were angry, very angry. He is protesting against the system with his 'I don't give a f**k' attitude despite his cool demeanor. That's what resonated with young film-goers in the seventies and why it remains a cult classic. /Frank",Vanishing Point
127,vike3,A Timeless Classic Period Flick- Have always loved it.,10,8 January 2003,"You need to have experienced the 70's to garner the full appreciation for how this movie captured the essence of those times.  The plot is that there really is no plot.Kowalski's character and his interactions with the people he came into contact with is what makes this film.(along with 500 hp of white Mopar thunder)When you take a second look (or as in my case a 20th look), this film essentially shows us a series of everyday salt of the earth people who lived during those times.  It doesn't compel the viewer to try to picture themselves as some far reaching superhero or high ranking police detective. Kowalski is just your average joe, with a trivial job, who really just doesn't have a whole lot going for him nor does he give a damn.This movie is for the rural, mechanically inclined gear heads out there who often wondered what would happen if instead of stopping for the cops I just put the foot to the floor and kept on running. Screw them, catch me if you can baby ! You'll also find that many of the same themes from the film are prevalent today: drugs,religious cults,racism, music,same-sex marriages,man's preoccupation with the automobile, police corruption, suicide. Sure there are a lot of differences between the ways things were back then and today, but this movie shows you that the more things change, the more they stay the same.",Vanishing Point
128,hochmeister,"Good film, albeit with flaws",7,1 August 2009,"Vanishing Point is a film that combines the sprawling south-western landscapes and late 60's/ early 70s counter-culture backdrop of Easy Rider with the visceral car chase sequences of Bullitt and The French Connection. The Film follows Kowalski(Barry Newman), a 30-something ex-cop turned road racer/car delivery man, in his cross country quest to drive a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Denver to a customer in San Fransisco. Fueled by Benzedrine, Kowalski leads police on a car chase of epic proportions in his quest to archive total freedom behind the wheel.This 1971 cult classic Delivers on thrills along with providing the viewer stunning shots of the American southwest that are sure to stick with you long after watching the film. Baby-boomer's will be sure to find the films grungy hippie aesthetics and groovy soundtrack a nostalgic reminder of their adolescence. Younger viewers will be able to appreciate the film as a period piece reflecting the clash of free loving 60's ideology with that of the conservative law enforcement in the south's rural areas.The movie, however, is defiantly not for everyone. Sarafian chooses to tell the story of his counter culture hero in a very visual style, leaving dialogue sequences few and far between. Kowalski himself is only engaging in dialogue a few times over the course of the entire film, including a memorable scene in which Kowalski carries on a conversation involving a blind disk jockey with whom he seems to share an almost telepathic link. At times this leaves the film feeling a little bit slow for modern viewer tastes.Overall, movie lovers will find Vanishing Point to be visually appealing, albeit with an at times slow pace and generally sparse dialogue. Flaws that if you can get past will leave you with an entertaining diamond in the rough from the early 70's.",Vanishing Point
129,austin_tayla,Favorite movie of all time,10,14 September 2009,"I first saw this movie when i was in second grade. I was watching the speed channel with my dad and this had come on after American muscle car. I instantly liked it as soon as i'd seen that 426 challenger. Most people talk about the symbolism of this movie, it definitely has some, but i only caught on to that aspect when my dad bought the VHS for me and i watched it almost once a week and began to notice these things. All that aside i just loved the sound of the car, the music, his love for being on the open road and being a free man. This movie is what cemented my love for cars, and my whole lifestyle as a car crazy s.o.b. I thought the scene where he left the bar where he bought all that speed and stomped on it past that fence and you just get immersed into the whole movie. From there on i was hooked, and it only gets better as the movie progresses. The wild cop chase, the race with the jaguar, super soul, and finally winds down to the dozers. If you ever get a chance to see this movie and love cars take your opportunity and enjoy it, because this movie may change your whole life as it did mine. And if your seeing viggo mortensen driving that white challenger you are watching the wrong version but don't turn it off because you still get tho see and hear that challenger as well as a nice black 69 charger taking part in the chasing action. I hope you enjoy the move as much as i did if any of you ever see it.",Vanishing Point

To me, this is a Christian movie through and through. Maybe not right for everybody, and just subtle enough (I guess) that most wouldn't get it. But that's what it is. He is working through his own mortal struggle as his destiny draws close. That's why Jake Kowalski half heartedly waves off such worldly factors such as police tickets, friendship, and even at times, drugs. Notice the disinterest or distraction in his face to something unseen outwardly. He has one foot in our world, and one foot in the next, the kingdom of Jesus.

It has so many identities, a car chase movie simply being one of them. It both deconstructs and pays tribute to the American love affair with the automobile and cinema. It's also a love letter to the 60s, playing up themes of freedom and escaping oppression. Most importantly, it's a classic heroes journey. Kowalski, the hero has a mission, a romantically Americana mission, and he let's nothing get in his way. Movies like Vanishing Point aren't duplicated, because they cannot be.

We can see an unstoppable quest of liberty from the hero, but the acting is really poor and the background story of the main character seem to have been forgotten to the profit of car chase scenes.If you like action movies, you better go for big blockbusters rather than go for this one. The other characters are basic stereotypes of Hippies or cops and don't come with anything interesting to add to the movie.The story in itself is far from original, you better pass your way on this movie.",Vanishing Point

Kowalski's character is very much representative of the concept of freedom and openness.The same qualities that led to the creation of a great nation but the deterioration of which is beautifully portrayed in subtle ways.The crash seen could be seen as the ultimate protest of free soul against the oppressive and over powering bureaucracy.The chase sequences have been carefully taken.The white car is symbolic of white horse since horse could be considered as the correct representation of wild west.It also denotes freedom of both expressions and actions.The character riding the white car could be equated to a knight riding white horse ie a medieval times take over.The idea is the dark forces which existed during the medieval times are still relevant.Even though ultimate victory cannot be said to be fully with either good or bad forces the director has clearly portrayed that such bold fight against establishments are bound to happen throughout history of mankind ; one such as of Kowalski's.The brave fight put up by kowalski , the refusal to accept defeat,considering death more noble than surrendering oneself to evil forces are typical behavior and values which contributed to the creation of one of the greatest nations of the world.The deterioration of these characters is painfully portrayed by the director.A must see movie ......",Vanishing Point

136,sp_m_h,An epitaph to the Muscle car era.....,10,31 December 2013,"Much has been written about this movie, so the story is well known. The main character is a man known as Kowalski who delivers cars for a living. He has done other things though. He was a Vietnam veteran, a former car and bike racing driver and an ex cop, but in the film he collects a car on a Friday night in Colorado to drive it back to San Francisco, California, in 15 hours. ( a journey of some 1200 miles ).Given the car he is driving, a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T 440ci V8 with a 4 speed manual transmission, which is also allegedly "" hopped up to over 160 "", it is technically achievable, however, as he will be driving mainly on the back roads, no one seems to think he can do it. To help him, he visits a friend at the start and take a supply of speed and then gets on his way. And then the fun begins.So what is the movie really about?....Well, if you read all the other comments, and I recommend you do, you will see the main points of the plot and events, etc, so I wont be repeating these here, but to me, none of them get to the real raison d'etre of Kowalski and the movie.You first have to look at the time period in the US in 1970/71. The Vietnam war was still ongoing and by then the protest against it was very wide spread. In addition, there was still a very strong racism element and the US was in effect a Police state, only much more so than today.Then there was the Muscle care era which was at its peak in 1970/71, but by 1973, it was all but dead as emission laws made many of the big block engines illegal. The 70 Dodge Challenger R/T 440 ci V8 was one of the fastest in its day and with a 4 speed manual transmission was good for around 375 bhp in stock form, however, we are told that it is hopped up to do over 160 mph, ( standard was around 140 mph ) although no details of how it is tuned are given other than a couple of cops saying it is allegedly supercharged.Then he have Kowalski himself. On face value it would seem he has been a failure throughout his life ( well the bits we get to see in flash back ), but is he really?....No. The way he drives the Dodge shows you that he is in a different league to the cops and like all racing drivers, instead of slowing down, he changes down and accelerates to even faster speeds, so he isn't simply a good driver, he is a great driver. One of the very best.He doesn't just drive the car, he becomes part of it and it becomes part of him. He knows that whenever he changes down a gear or two, he has rocket like acceleration that will get him out of trouble and when the roads get closed off, he simply takes it out into the desert. As Super soul says, Kowalski is one of the last great American hero's and that is what the movie is really about.It is an epitaph to the last of the real hero's, Kowalski, the last of the real muscle cars and the last blast of a freedom that the police are trying to destroy. Kowalski knows that, just like the muscle car, his time has come and gone, so he pushes himself on an almost impossible journey that he knows will end in his death. After all, what is there to live for. Nothing except the speed and the race, and so at the end we see him smash into two bulldozers rather than surrender.On face value, this seems madness. He could easily stop and although he might be imprisoned for a while ( or maybe not as he hadn't really done anything wrong ), he would get to drive again, but for Kowalski its not so simplistic. He is on a one way journey and this is evident by the flash backs to the past events in his life. We see him as a racing car driver, a bike racer, when he was a cop and the death of his beloved. He whole life story is laid out along the road, so it is obvious that death is the only destination. This is further confirmed when we see the naked chick shows him all the news stories she has collected about him long before this journey. Its like she is an Angel saying, this was your life Kowalski.There is also the scene not in the US versions ), where he picks up a female hitchhiker ( death ) who spends the night with him and then mysteriously disappears before he wakes. Kowalski knows its coming, but rather than fear it, he drives into the next world at maximum speed, smiling and with him dies the last of the great muscle cars.Whether you agree with my synopsis or not, this is one of the great movies of all time and if you do nothing else in your life, you have to see this film and preferably on a big screen with surround sound.",Vanishing Point

Cleavon Little who is one of the most underrated actors and a great loss to the movies has delivered a great role. The film is a cross-country car chase with the cops in pursuit of a lone anti-establishment ex racer played by Barry Newman. Cleavon little plays a radio DJ who is commentating the chase to listeners and which soon captures media attention, catapulting Newman into a celebrity who is defying the law, gaining much respect with the public, especially Little.

There were so many gaps in the plot, it was hugely open to personal interpretation. Kowalski had no first name, he had no reason to rush the delivery journey, he had no reason to die! I can remember the elation of seeing the chase scenes for the first time and remember the fact that NO special effects were used, the car did exactly what it said on the box ! Excellent film (sad and pointless, but excellent) oh yes , and music to take you right back when. To this day, the 1970/71 Dodge Challenger R/T is THE coolest car on the roads (sorry, Bullitt fans). This film Is dated ,but thats not a bad thing, For all the advances of film technology, they couldn't better this when they made the 1997? remake, it was TOO user friendly, all the gaps where filled in, (name, motive,etc)and it became just another chase movie.

The '70 Challenger rocks and makes this film. It just looks so good doing those stunts. And I can rest easy knowing that the car destroyed at the end of the film wasn't a '70 Challenger, but a cheaper, more abundant '69 Camaro. Barry Newman's performance is great, and Cleavon Little is also brilliant. Not to sure about the rest of the cast though. people always seem to ask why he's driving like that in the fist place, and why crash? Well, hes bet his dealer that he can make the distance in the time for the value of his tab, so a valid reason to do it. And the flashbacks on Kowolski's life shows how bad it's been for him, so suicide would seem reasonable. Or perhaps he was just to stoned to realise what he's doing? Anyway, as everyone knows, the film was remade for TV in '97, and has recently been released on DVD. The remake was obviously made on a lower budget, and has received bad reviews. I disagree, and will be reviewing the remake soon. This is regularly classed as a cult film, and rightly so. Not to everyones taste, but you should really check it out.",Vanishing Point

I think rating this film as a road film or a car film is severely underestimating its value as a legend of ""freedom"", what 70s were all about. I first saw this film in my early thirties. I was fascinated by the simple yet powerful expression of the will to reach freedom. All the reactions of Kowalsky, the naked rider, the blind DJ, the store owner, etc, they were all after ""freedom"". And the possibility of being deprived of freedom is the reason why Kowalsky commits suicide at the end. I will remember it as a perfect legend of freedom, and, despite its simplicity, one of the best films ever made.",Vanishing Point
