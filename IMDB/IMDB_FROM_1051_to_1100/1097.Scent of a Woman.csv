0,TheLittleSongbird,Lengthy but very impressive- Pacino makes the film as good as it is,9,13 February 2011,"Scent of a Woman may be very lengthy, but it is also a very impressive film. The film looks beautiful, Martin Brest's direction is quite excellent, the script avoids being too melodramatic or soapy it is actually quite poignant when it needs to be and the story while very loosely based on the 1974 Italian film is always believable.The acting is top-drawer. Chris O'Donnell is surprisingly impressive, I've known him to be bland before but he is quiet and understated here, and Gabrielle Anwar is lovely. But it is Al Pacino that makes the film as good as it is, he is just extraordinary. Whether tangoing with Anwar, berating O'Donnell's cowardly schoolmates or uttering his infamous laugh, Pacino whatever he's doing on screen gives one of his greatest performances.In conclusion, very impressive elevated more so by Pacino. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Scent of a Woman
1,bkoganbing,A Generation Gap Of Values,9,20 March 2008,"In Scent of a Woman Young Chris O'Donnell at the Baird Prep School on a scholarship, has to earn the money he needs for a round-trip back to Oregon to see his family at Christmas break. He takes a job posting off a bulletin board at school advertising for a companion to a blind man. The blind man turns out to be Al Pacino whose sister and her family want to unload him so they can go away for Thanksgiving.Pacino is no helpless invalid however. He's a former lieutenant colonel in the army and used to being obeyed on command. But he's facing a crisis in his life, he's just tired of being an invalid and dependent on people. O'Donnell's having a crisis too. Headmaster James Rebhorn feels he and another student, Philip Seymour Hoffman, saw an act of vandalism committed on the school grounds. It goes against O'Donnell's grain to be an informant. But these other kids, Hoffman included come from old money and can buy their way out of most things. If the ax has to fall as Pacino tells him, it's going to fall his way.The film is a touching story involving a generation gap of values that is bridged when Pacino and O'Donnell discover a genuine respect and affection for each other. Pacino's iconoclastic retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade finally won for him an Oscar for Best Actor that his peers had not voted him, despite being nominated 7 previous times in both the lead and supporting categories. In fact that same year Pacino was also up in the Supporting Actor category for Glengarry Glen Ross.Chris O'Donnell had a breakout performance as the young preppie who has far more integrity than his richer and more privileged classmates. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as the kid who rats under the financial umbrella of daddy's millions.Scent of a Woman is a great part for Al Pacino, not my favorite role for him. That one for me is ....And Justice For All. Still this award like the one given to Paul Newman for The Color of Money is more for Pacino's lifetime of artistic achievement in the cinema. And that's one artistic life anyone could envy.",Scent of a Woman
2,SnoopyStyle,some memorable iconic moments,6,15 February 2016,"Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) is a poor scholarship student attending an exclusive prep school filled with wealthy kids. He takes a job babysitting angry blind hard-drinking retired Army Ranger Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) over the Thanksgiving weekend. He needs the money to go home to Oregon for Christmas. He witnesses with George Willis, Jr. (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a prank being prepared by some students on Dean Trask (James Rebhorn). Trask pushes Charlie for the names promising to expel them both at a special assembly. Trask also promises a guarantee admission to Harvard for Charlie. Frank convinces Charlie to go on a trip to NYC. Finally Frank reveals his plan to have a blow out and then kill himself.I am not a Chris O'Donnell fan during his early years. He is too weak and too bland. I hate it when movies make him the lead. He's not compelling enough to be the lead. Al Pacino is acting big and overshadows everything. His antics leave the movie with some very memorable iconic moments. I just don't care enough about the limp weak Charlie. The movie is also too long by half hour or more.",Scent of a Woman
3,kosmasp,Al taking it to a whole new level,9,18 April 2018,"Al Pacino does not even need all the senses to make us feel great. Seriously though while the movie itself might have been rated an 7 or 8, Pacino makes it really worth while. And while a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman is also a sight to be seen (I did imagine him playing the second lead a couple of times and it might have elevated this movie too), it's Chris O'Donell and his babyface and innocence we get served here.And his performance is good too, playing the gullible pupil to Als mentor and teacher. But of course there is so much more to it. Even if the life lesson might feel a bit too ""preachy"" and even if some reactions by Chris may not be as subtle as you wish they were, this really is gripping and when Al starts to talk .. every bet is off. This could be used as masterclass in acting, not that it's something new when it comes to Al. There is some swearing (if you mind) and there are also some flaws - which can be overlooked easily in the presence of greatness ...",Scent of a Woman
4,classicsoncall,"""Say hello to the potluck party from New York City!""",9,30 September 2018,"There's not too much doubt Al Pacino earned his Best Actor award against some pretty stiff competition. His portrayal of Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade requires him to be cynical, ill tempered, spontaneous and overbearing, and he pulls it off with animal intensity. Personally, I don't think I would have hung around too long after an initial introduction to the Colonel. Not that I couldn't take it, but why willingly put up with the abuse? Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) needed the money, so I guess you can't blame him there, but he sure did have to earn it.It's kind of difficult to know if Charlie made the right decision on not ratting out his merry prankster classmates. Slade's impassioned speech at the disciplinary hearing made it sound all right and good, but I kind of wonder if Charlie wouldn't have shown another kind of integrity in upholding the honor of the school. Tough call there, and in a way, he made it through without violating anyone's trust, but the path was greased by George Willis (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) getting grilled first. His old man's big bucks never really got a chance to help him.The story's narrative weaves in and out of the title's puzzling riddle, as the blind Colonel Slade's heightened senses take over in identifying and characterizing the women he meets. The tango scene in the movie was my favorite, eliciting applause from the bystanders who witnessed Slade's confident movements on the dance floor. What works against the film's credibility was that insane Ferrari ride through the streets of New York City at seventy five miles an hour, all without a hitch while proclaiming loudly that something like that would have been entirely impossible. Heck, even Dustin Hoffman got blindsided by a taxi on a closed off city street for a scene in ""Midnight Cowboy"". And he wasn't blind!",Scent of a Woman
5,lee_eisenberg,"Nowadays, it's hard to believe that this was directed by the same guy who did ""Gigli"".",8,11 October 2005,"After twenty years as an A-list star, Al Pacino took home an Oscar for his role in ""Scent of a Woman"". He plays blind Lt. Col. Frank Slade, who talks like he's ready to tear your throat apart, but has a heart of gold. Sound like a cliché? Well it's not. ""Scent of a Woman"" succeeds where so many movies have failed, probably because Al Pacino is in the lead role (almost anyone else very likely would have turned the character into a maudlin dweeb).Anyway, the story has college student Charlie Sims (Chris O'Donnell) agreeing to be a caretaker for Col. Slade, and the colonel takes Charlie on an adventure that he'll never forget. Along the way, a rather unusual event happens at Charlie's college (that scene will most likely make you at least giggle if not break out into laughter), and the colonel sees no choice but to get involved.Among other things, this movie has a number of people who weren't yet famous but would make their marks in later years: Philip Seymour Hoffman as Charlie's friend George, James Rebhorn as the dean, and even Frances Conroy several years before ""Six Feet Under"". ""Scent of a Woman"" is like a breath of fresh air in the stench of so many lousy movies. Which brings us to the question: why did director Martin Brest have to direct that god-awful ""Gigli""?",Scent of a Woman
6,jboothmillard,Scent of a Woman,8,12 May 2009,"From Oscar nominated director Martin Brest (Beverly Hills Cop, Meet Joe Black), I had heard and seen bits and pieces of this film and the lead actor, I just had to see it. Basically Charlie Simms (Golden Globe nominated Chris O'Donnell) attending Baird School, and classmate George Willis, Jr. (young Philip Seymour Hoffman) are witnesses to a prank on headmaster Mr. Trask (Independence Day's James Rebhorn), who secretly bribes Charlie for the culprits identities. Charlie, yearning for money to return to his family in Oregon, has accepted a job looking after blind, eccentric and retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Al Pacino) over the Thanksgiving weekend. Slade however plans a trip to New York, to supple all the pleasures, such as luxury hotel comfort, fine eating and drinking (wines), dancing, an escort, and after all this he plans to ""blow his brains out"". Over the time they spend together, Charlie sees what an interesting character Frank is, but of course it is when he is holding a gun that his conscience truly comes to a head. Thankfully Frank doesn't commit suicide, and they both return to New Hampshire, where Charlie faces his courtroom style assembly to find and punish the prank culprits. Frank surprisingly shows up, in place of Charlie's parents, and he shouts his opinions of all events Charlie has explained to him, and Frank manages to get him off the hook. Also starring Gabrielle Anwar as Donna, Richard Venture as W.R. Slade, Bradley Whitford as Randy, Ron Eldard as Officer Gore, Frances Conroy as Christine Downes, Sally Murphy as Karen Rossi and Nicholas Sadler as Harry Havemeyer. It may be almost two and half hors long, but I can't imagine any of the material being taken out. O'Donnell is very good as the unworldly teenage escort, but it is of course Pacino that steals the entire film with his brilliant eccentricity, avoiding too much sentimentality, he thoroughly deserved his Academy Award. His finest moments include recognising womens' perfumes (as the title suggests), the tango dance with Anwar, driving a rented Ferrari at high speed with a terrified O'Donnell, obviously the assembly, and every time he barks his famous ""hoo-ha"" cough. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Al Pacino was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro) on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Scent of a Woman
7,ccthemovieman-1,A Speech Everyone Likes,7,21 July 2006,"This was a different type of story with excellent acting by Al Pacino, who makes a speech at the end of the film that many people think is one of the coolest speeches they've ever heard on film.Pacino's character, ""Lt. Cl. Frank Slade,"" is a turnoff for awhile because he's so gruff, but he grows on you and becomes fascinating to watch as a blind man who doesn't act like a blind man. Chris O'Donnell, as ""Charlie Simms,"" plays the opposite: a nice, young college kid whom Pacino winds up taking under wing. The only part I didn't care for was the beginning with Charlie's obnoxious friends, but that ties in later with Pacino's memorable speech.A different kind of story, marred only by a little too much profanity. If you haven't seen it, I recommend checking it out. You'll enjoy it",Scent of a Woman
8,rmax304823,I Got A Loaded .45 Here -- You Got Pimples.,7,14 December 2011,"It's hokey and predictable but I enjoyed it. You need a feel good movie once in a while. It's cheaper than Xanax.Pacino won an Oscor for his portrayal of a blind and hopeless retired Army colonel, intent on one last expensive fling in New York before offing himself, and he deserved it. Unlike some other actors of his age who showed equal skill in their careers -- Jack Nicholson, for instance -- he hasn't settled into a well-worn and familiar groove. He seems to bring something a little fresh to every role. I think he was nominated seven times for an Academy Award before finally getting this one, for whatever such an award is worth.His best-known scene is the tango he does in the ballroom of the Pierre Hotel with Gabriel Anwar. She's had dance training but you couldn't tell from this scene. Pacino isn't much of a dancer but he doesn't have to be. Like the other guests in the room, Anwar and Pacino are swept up in the dramatic rhythm of the Argentine tune, which I think is called ""Por una cabeza,"" something about a horse race. Anyone who wants to see the dance done expertly, which is quite a sight, should check out Carlos Saura's ""Tango."" Gabriel Anwar is beautiful, elegant, exotic -- and she can act too. It's a small but memorable role and a rather complicated one, but she manages it exquisitely. It's the kind of part for which Jane Alexander won a Supporting Actress award for ""All the President's Men."" Too bad Anwar didn't get more prominence on the screen.The story itself -- preppie in a quandary takes a temporary job as Pacino's guide on his last fling -- is corny and familiar. If it had been made anywhere outside of Hollywood Pacino might have succeeded in blowing his brains out in the Waldorf Astoria. As it is, he is rescued and restored to his spiritual life by Chris O'Donnell as the troubled preppie.Back at the prestigious prep school, in an anticlimax, Pacino gets to save O'Donnell's hide by making the kind of unrelentingly brutal and honest speech about the meaning of ""honor"" that is usually reserved for the summations of heroic defense counsels. He bellows and waves his hands. The student body gives him a standing ovation and the stern headmaster, James Rebhorn, slumps in frustration. I felt a little sorry for Rebhorn. After all, it was he and his shiny new car that were under the giant balloon full of white paint when it was popped. He hadn't done anything to deserve it, and it was a trick dirty enough to pee off the Pope.O'Donnell hasn't been seen that much since this movie was released. He's the perfect prep school kid though. He looks just right, and wardrobe has given him a big help. And his voice has the high, piping quality of a boy just out of adolescence. As his, squeamish friend, Philip Seymoure Hoffman is inventive, if at times obvious. He's become a fine actor though.In the most tense scene, Pacino dons his dress uniform preparatory to shooting himself. It's a Lieutenant Colonel's uniform. I have a suggestion for the United States Army. Stop handing out so many campaign ribbons, badges, medals, name plates, and the other junk that festoons his chest. It's beginning to look a little Latin American, fellas.",Scent of a Woman
9,moonspinner55,Overcharged...,4,18 February 2007,"Prep school lad takes weekend job looking after blind, hard-bitten former Army colonel, who is on a personal mission of self-destruction. Adapted from the Giovanni Arpino novel and 1974 Italian film ""Profumo Di Donna"", this overlong picture directed by Martin Brest is unrestrained, overreaching and ham-fisted. Filmed in autumnal colors (brackish reds and browns), it doesn't even look good. Oscar winner Al Pacino chews the scenery in inelegant fashion--there are few real highlights to his performance because Brest encourages Pacino to treat every scene as a show shopper. Chris O'Donnell is easier to take as his teenage charge, yet the screenplay is obnoxious and continually prods us for a response with 'darkly comic' histrionics. *1/2 from ****",Scent of a Woman
10,Quinoa1984,"Longish, overrated, but watchable",5,3 April 2001,"Scent of the Woman has a story, but luckily (mainly since it's not the greatest), it sticks to it's dialog and actors. Brief plot summary goes as this: a prep kid needs money so he takes a job looking after a blind old guy who lives in a cottage with his family. If that was it, this movie wouldn't have even gotten off the ground, but then something interesting happens: the old guy is quite the classic (bleep).And this Lieutenant Colonel is played by Al Pacino in the 'bravado' style of his abilities, his abilities being of his instincts, even if it is not at all one of his best performances. Too much of it is over-emphasis, close to being not even a complete person, even in the strongest moments. It's almost as if the Oscar to Pacino was more for his career up till then, not even for this film necessarily. Slade leads the young man (Chris O'Donnel) on a coming of age odyssey in NYC. If you take this part of the film (like taking the entire 90 minutes of Tom Hanks on Cast Away island and sea), you have something quite intriguing at times, but the film also has some un-needed stuff left over from preppie-school message-movie land, and it doesn't work at all. Still, Pacino does what he can, and some supporting actors are good.",Scent of a Woman
11,sunwarrior13,Pacino Finally Wins An Oscar For Scent Of A Woman,9,6 March 2012,"Scent of a Woman is a drama film directed by Martin Brest that tells the story of a preparatory school student who takes a job as an assistant to an irascible, blind, medically retired Army officer. It stars Al Pacino, Chris O'Donnell, James Rebhorn, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Gabrielle Anwar.Driven by an extravagant, tour-de-force performance by Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman is the story of Frank Slade, a blind, retired army colonel who hires Charlie Simms, a poor college student on the verge of expulsion, to take care of him over Thanksgiving weekend. At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mismatched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. By the end of the film, we have arrived at the usual conclusion of the coming-of-age movie, and the usual conclusion of the prep school movie. But rarely have we been taken there with so much intelligence and skill.Also,the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award.It might soar on Al Pacino's performance more than the drama itself, but what a performance it is -- big, bold, occasionally over- the-top.",Scent of a Woman

13,hitchcockthelegend,"Please? I mean, you're just in a slump right now.",8,27 July 2009,"Al Pacino plays Frank Slade, a former Lieutenant Colonel who lost his career and his sight due to a stupid accident. Living in New Hampshire with tolerant relatives, Frank has become bitter and angry with the world, so much so he plans to peg out of it after one last hurrah in New York City. Enter Charlie Simms {Chris O'Donnell}, a hard up student from Baird College who is trying to earn $300 just to baby-sit the volatile Frank over the Thanksgiving weekend. Originally oblivious to Frank's plans, Charlie unwittingly becomes an accomplice to what Frank has in mind, yet both of them have no idea just how life defining the weekend could prove to be.In the main, Scent Of A Woman survives its obvious creaks because of Pacino's Oscar winning, barn storming show. The film itself is engaging and ever watchable, if perhaps a touch too long. Pacino as Slade is plunged into implausible set pieces, driving a Ferrari, dancing the tango with the petite Donna {Gabrielle Anwar} and bluffing traffic cops with care free abandon. But such is the gusto and conviction that Pacino puts into the role, it scarcely matters about improbability since we are having too much of a good time with him. Ably supported by O'Donnell, who sadly after this film wouldn't go on to a better level of acting, Pacino manages to off set the short comings in the piece.....There is no real drama to speak of in Scent Of A Woman. Some tight coiled spring like moments such as a family dinner and the point of Frank's journey aside, it's a pretty basic and safely written screenplay-with an ending that has divided many across the globe. It's an ending that to me, sits perfectly within the story, in fact it was apparent to me that it would go that way. This is not just Frank's journey, this is Charlie's as well, the ending just brings it all together as regards two polar opposites meeting in the middle at a differing, but crucial, point in their lives. Hell!, I beat my chest and shout Hoo-Hah! upon every viewing, and that's the impact, and the result, that director Martin Brest and his team were hinting at all thru the film.Sometimes safe and ham can be real enjoyable, especially when backed by a certain soft eyed Italian American actor from the Bronx. 8/10",Scent of a Woman
14,Theo Robertson,Drags A Bit ...,6,28 February 2005,"... Or perhaps I should say drags a big bit The problem I have with SCENT OF A WOMEN is that it resembles a few other feel good movies at the time . Following on from the success of DEAD POETS SOCIETY studio producers only seemed to be interested in making movies that were in danger of giving audiences diabetes , that's when they weren't making movies featuring a cop /a lodger/a babysitter/a flat mate /etc bringing murder and mayhem to an all American couple Despite Al Pacino featuring in every poster and trailer clip SCENT OF A WOMAN revolves around much of its ( Far too long ) running time on the character of Charlie Simms who keeps getting into trouble at his private school and I was so reminded of DEAD POETS SOCIETY that when Charlie takes on a job to look after a blind man I kept expecting Robin Williams to turn up . Fortunately the man who Charlie is to look after Colonel Frank Slade isn't played by Williams but by Al Pacino . When I say "" fortunately "" I'm not dissing Robin Williams in any way but we get the opportunity to see Pacino cast against type in a blackly comic role . Colonel Slade is something of a pathetic figure and as you expect Pacino plays him with typical intensity and makes the whole movie more enjoyable than it possibly deserves to be , but he only comes to the fore a lengthy way into the movie which as I've stated is too long to be truly successful . Would a Hollywood studio consider an unsolicted script 180 pages long ? Of course not Apart from the overblown running time the other flaw can be summed up by the score by Thomas Newman . As far as film scores go it's very good , but again it resembles work from other movies . The two note piano tune that features on the soundtrack is haunting but it's almost identical to the one that featured in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION where Red leaves prison . But I've already mentioned that SCENT OF A WOMAN reminded me of other movies",Scent of a Woman
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"It lingers, in the good way",8,7 April 2011,"Charlie spends Thanksgiving weekend taking care of a blind, retired officer to earn money to get home from his all-boy boarding school for Christmas. The latter unexpectedly takes them both to New York to live for one more time, and the two bond and get through to each other, in spite of how different they are. This is about integrity and earning what you get, as opposed to having anything handed to you. While it has moments of Hollywood, it's a timeless message and this ought not to be forgotten... and certainly needs no remaking(and no, I have not watched the original, nor read the novel), lest generations pass and something vital to this changes between then and now. The acting is great for all concerned. O'Donnell goes beyond the naive youthful vibe that comes natural to him and comes off as someone with strength of character. There are no big parts for women in this, and Pacino's role is, ahem, focused on them, and yet he is always respectful towards them(...well, other than the ones he's related to) and there is nothing exploitative in the presentation of them. They are classical beauties, stunning and natural, and they don't invite subjugation, nor do they experience any. This is filmed and edited well. There is tension, and for not manipulating us, this manages to make us empathize with the leads. Because we understand them, and because they are real. They and their actions are not perfect, and they never claim that to be the case. Both of them admit who they are. This is well-paced, and the two and a half hours go by smoothly, with no excess. There is a little strong language in this, none of it gratuitous. I recommend this to everyone mature enough for it(audiences should be at least in their teens). 8/10",Scent of a Woman
16,view_and_review,Woo Haa,8,5 October 2015,"I'm at the age where the movies I watched in my youth have been reduced to flashes: a scene here, a quote there, or maybe even just a mood. In my efforts to re-watch/re-experience some of the movies of yesteryear Scent of a Woman crossed my desk. Or should I say, Scent of a Woman was being offered on Amazon Prime which made it free to view. In any case, I was pleased to watch it again with new eyes to really understand the movie.First of all, I never knew Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in the movie. Granted, he did play a small yet significant role and he wasn't the actor he was when he died, but it was still good to see him and have that, ""OMG I didn't know he was in this!"" moment. My God did he play such a good rich snobby a-hole. I couldn't help but disdain him in this movie.Secondly, I'd forgotten that the oft sampled ""Woo Haa"" from Al Pacino was from this movie. Somehow I thought it was from a lot later movie like ""Every Given Sunday"" or something in that date range.As for the movie, it was a classic. Al Pacino plays Frank Slade, a surly old retired military man that became blind. He ended up at his nieces home for care because he annoys or outright angers everyone and she was the only one that would put up with him. He has no regard for social etiquette or the feelings of others, especially when it comes to his own family. Chris O'Donnell is Charlie Simms, a poor teenager attending Baird private school on a scholarship 3000 miles from home. To earn money he agrees to look after Colonel Frank Slade during Thanksgiving break.The movie hinged upon Al Pacino's performance as most of the movie was just him and Chris. Al Pacino certainly delivered. Not two minutes after Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade was introduced did I find myself wanting poor Charlie to tell him to jump off a bridge and leave him by his blind, lonesome self. Of course there would have been no movie then but there would have been a small bit of satisfaction.What the movie showed was that everyone has some good and everyone has at least a small part to play in improving the lives of others. Frank Slade, as embittered and abrasive as he was still had some endearing qualities and could still serve a purpose in bettering someone. The tenuous and patronizing relationship between Frank and Charlie grew in only the fashion that a Frank Slade relationship could develop; it was forged in the fires of Frank's drill sergeant tongue and his crusted still-beating heart.Really, if I enjoyed the movie for anything it was Frank Slade's speech at the end. Many a movie--especially dramas of a certain type--end with an impassioned and portentous speech, but not many of them are good or hit the mark. Scent of a Woman was the exception. Frank entered into a ""I'll tell you"" tirade in Frank Slade fashion that was only made more striking because of how it was given and the situation in which it was given. It was a wonderful way to end the movie although it didn't end exactly there. Yes, two-and-a-half hours of viewing was worth the three to five minutes of Frank Slade v. Baird School.",Scent of a Woman
17,evanston_dad,Pacino's Oscar Bait,5,6 January 2009,"You can tell that Al Pacino was determined not to let the 8th chance of an Oscar pass him by, so he throws everything he's got at the Academy voters in this hammy performance as a cranky, blind veteran.Chris O'Donnell gives a blank-faced performance as the preppy college student who's paid to care for the blind dude for the day, but boy doesn't he get more than he bargained for, and isn't Pacino's irascible geezer a hoot as he shows O'Donnell a good time? Why director Martin Brest needed two-and-a-half-hours to tell a story that could have made a half-hour sitcom is beyond me.Oh and guess what.....Pacino won his Oscar. Michael Corleone is turning over in his grave....Grade: C",Scent of a Woman
18,HotToastyRag,It makes you like it despite your best efforts,7,18 December 2018,"If you're an Al Pacino fan, you've probably already seen Scent of a Woman. If you're a youngster and just ""discovering"" his talent, you'll definitely want to add this one to your list. Not only is it a cute, heartwarming, relatively light flick-given his usual movies-but he won his Oscar for it! While I prefer Frankie and Johnny for an ""isn't Al Pacino adorable?"" movie, you do need to see this one if you like him.A remake of the 1974 Italian flick, Profumo di donna, a blind man decides to have a perfect day before committing suicide. Isn't that premise so European? Now, since you know this movie is hailed as being sweet and inspiring, and you know that Al Pacino takes a young kid under his wing, do you think he's going to go through with his initial plan and become a negative role model for schoolboy Chris O'Donnell? Well, you'll have to watch the movie to find out, and when you do, you'll see Al Pacino ballroom dance, crack jokes, drive a sports car, and shout out ""Hoo-ah!"" about a hundred times. And, no matter how annoying that sounds, I guarantee you'll chuckle every time he says it.For me, this is one of those movies that makes me like it despite my best efforts not to. It's not my favorite, but it really is sweet and inspiring, just like everyone says it is. How many movies can you find where Al Pacino is the lovable good guy? Not very many, so catch them when you can.",Scent of a Woman
19,gradyharp,Performances to Remember and Treasure,10,8 February 2006,"Now and then it is refreshing to turn back time and elect to watch older films of substance, a reminder that there are certain cinematic characters that have become indelible. SCENT OF A WOMAN provided Al Pacino a stage on which to perform a true character, unlike any he had played before, and make it one of those creations that still, 15 years later, evoke a smile and applause.Blind, acerbic, loudmouthed, irascible Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino) hires preppy, in need of money, Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) to escort him to New York for a 'final fling'. Charlie has his own issues that depress him, but the two end up having such a grand time in New York that they bond strongly - until Slade dresses for his final moment. The tearful Charlie convinces Slade not to off himself, Charlie's innate character wins Slade's gruff heart, and Slade ends up defending Charlie in an unforgettable prep school 'mock trial'.The complete manner in which Pacino inhabits this role is a stroke of studied genius: as a blind man his every physical and verbal movements are wholly convincing. There are many fine moments in this film, not the least of which is the famous Tango scene, or the confrontation between Charlie and Slade regarding a suicide plan. Pacino won Best Actor for his role and it is richly deserved. This is a film to cherish. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",Scent of a Woman
20,The_Void,"Very energetic, corny and enjoyable",7,25 September 2005,"Scent of a Woman may well the corniest film ever made. For that reason alone, I should hate it; but I cant because, despite the ever-present layer of cheese; this is just a damn good movie. The film allows it's characters to develop throughout, and through a series of silly and unlikely sequences, we actually see them do that right before our eyes. Scenes that see Al Pacino dance the tango with Gabrielle Anwar, or Pacino visit his long lost brother are priceless and although almost every moment of this film is extremely unlikely and is drenched in corny music; you can forgive it because it's so much fun to watch. We follow a young man named Charlie. Charlie is in trouble at school as he witnessed a prank and, if he doesn't name the perpetrators in public - he'll be expelled. He's also taken a summer job as a babysitter for a blind man, which spirals out of control as this cantankerous old man bungles his babysitter onto a plane and takes him to New York for one final weekend of luxury before ending it all.Al Pacino's character in this film is resoundingly different to any other character I've seen him play in any other film. It must be great for a thespian like Pacino to get a role like this, and he clearly enjoys himself playing it. Maybe even a little bit too much at times, as his constant shouts of 'Hoo-Hah!' would suggest; but the energy and talent that Pacino exudes onto the screen mean that you can forgive even when his mannerisms step over onto the wrong side of annoying. Pacino's co-star is then young Chris O'Donnell, who brilliantly offsets his ham with a restrained and understated performance. He often blends into the background, which isn't normally what you want for a lead; but the way he stands back and lets Pacino do all the work may be the only truly realistic thing in the entire film - as that's clearly how a quiet seventeen year old would react in this situation. The characters are an important element of the film, so it's lucky that director Martin Brest was able to recruit performers of this calibre. Scent of a Woman sometimes loses it's way where reality is concerned, but it's constant stream of entertainment offsets this brilliantly and what we are left with is a highly energetic and enjoyable film that is really hard not to go along with.",Scent of a Woman

22,namashi_1,Hoo-Haa... Pacino rules!,9,30 March 2010,"Adapted by Bo Goldman from the novel Il buio e il miele (Italian: Darkness and Honey) by Giovanni Arpino and from the 1974 screenplay for the movie Profumo di donna by Ruggero Maccari and Dino Risi, Martin Brest's 'Scent Of A Woman' is evergreen classic from the early 90's. Ho-Haa all the way man! 'Scent Of A Woman' tells the story of a young kid and his weekend boss, a blind retired Colonel. The film works big time, mainly because it has it's heart the right place. With a running time of over 156 minutes, here's a film that holds your attention from start to end. Pacino is a legend and rightly so. He's incredible, 'Scent Of A Woman' works because he really lets you down. He won the Academy-Award for Best Actor, and Ho-Haa he deserved it! Chris O'Donnell also pitches in a very mature performance, this is his best work as an actor. Philip Seymour Hoffman is efficient, as always.On the whole, 'Scent Of A Woman' is a winner all the way, a marvelous film. Two Big Thumbs Up! Ho-Haa!!",Scent of a Woman
23,StevePulaski,Oscar bait that was caught,6,25 March 2014,"The fact that Martin Brest's Scent of a Woman awarded Al Pacino his first and only Oscar to date is a fact that satisfies and infuriates simultaneously. It's nice to see an immensely talented actor finally get his due from Hollywood, however, it's upsetting to see it's for a film that largely pales in comparison to Pacino's other pictures such as The Godfather trilogy and Scarface and a performance that doesn't hold a candle to the ones he gave in the aforementioned films.It's bizarre out of the library of terrific Pacino performances we've been so grateful to see over the years, the Academy recognizes one that is good at the same time all over the place and inconsistent, even though it's one of the best inconsistent performances I have yet to see. The film centers around Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a student at a prestigious New England prep school who is assigned to look after a retired Army Ranger Lieutenant Colonel named Frank Slade (Al Pacino). Frank is a blind man, often loud, frequently outspoken, loves his drinks, and feels completely entitled to speak his mind whenever he feels like it. It is only a screen writing obligation that these two will embark on some life-altering adventures and find ways to open up to each other in ways they never foresaw.Scent of a Woman's writer Bo Goldman pulls no punches whatsoever, for this is a straight-forward drama about companionship and loss with little to no presence of deeper meaning or multilayered storytelling. Not every film needs to be heavy on symbology or even multilayered, but when a story is a sometimes merciless one-hundred and fifty-three minutes, one hopes that at some point a line is drawn and deeper, rawer human emotions surface or some other facet pops up to reveal another layer.But sadly there isn't one, and because of that, Scent of a Woman flounders because of how basic it is. We see young Charlie leave a lasting impact on Frank and Frank leave an impact on Charlie, which as cute as it is sometimes, can also be dreadfully boring, especially for such a lengthy amount of time. This is one-hundred and five minutes of material stretched out forty-eight minutes longer and occasionally finds itself going in circles over material and events it has just covered.When it comes down to the chemistry between Pacino and O'Donnell, it's uniformly solid. Both actors have a believable sense of friendship in the film, especially during scenes like the one at the dinner table, the one when Charlie allows Frank to drive a Ferrari down an unpopulated alleyway, or when Frank sticks up for Charlie in the end of the film. Both men are believable as friends and work well as an on-screen duo.With that being said, Pacino's performance still finds itself registering all over the place and having issues setting up a clear tone throughout the film. Frank will be calm and collective on some occasions mirroring the likes of mentally unstable on other occasions. Some scenes, Frank will be shouting at the top of his lungs, others, he'll be barely cracking a whisper. This is the performance that won Pacino the Oscar, mind you - not the subtleties he presented as Michael Corleone, not the brash assertiveness he exerted as Tony Montana, but the up-and-down tendencies he brought to the table in Scent of a Woman. While this is by no means a bad performance (and definitely shows its effectiveness by the end, with Frank in the courtroom scene), it still isn't the kind of performance one would see Pacino winning, especially with his already exceptional résumé.Furthermore, it's worth noting that the presence of Thomas Newman's turgid score that needs to emphasize every emotional instance in the film gets to be insufferable to say the least. Newman's score chimes in and plays precisely the kind of tune you expect to hear during scenes of conflict, happiness, joy, and sorrow with absolutely no subtly whatsoever. Then there's the courtroom scene that concludes the film, which feels extracted from a completely separate film.When you have a film that already overextends itself in its groggy runtime, presents a performance that is, for the lack of a better term, all over the place, and a score that leaves no ambiguity, Scent of a Woman almost seems down and out accept for the fact that it does present a well-orchestrated human interest story and how companionship is one of the fundamentals to a good life. Regardless of how long, occasionally tiresome, and overblown the film can be, it still possesses a delightful focus on character over plot, which I always admire.The film comes from Martin Brest, an underrated director known for his action comedies such as the exciting Beverly Hills Cop, the hilarious and too-often enthralling Midnight Run, and the unfairly bashed Gigli, which ostensibly crippled his career (Brest hasn't directed since its release in 2003). Brest's usual investment with character relationships is present but absent this time around are his action set pieces, which provide a nice addition of variety in Brest's short but sweet filmography.Scent of a Woman reminds me quite a bit of Dead Poets Society for more reasons than it deals with a prep school. Both films have a cloying obviousness to their writing and directing, making their themes completely heavy, and staging their emotional sequences as if they were the most powerful to ever exist. The film works best when it is underplaying its central ideas, focusing on more abstract scenes like the key scene here, which involves Frank on a plane fondly recalling the beautiful qualities of a woman, detailing the scent of her hair, the feel of her lips, the texture of her breasts, etc. It's a beautiful scene - Scent of a Woman needed more of those.",Scent of a Woman
24,blanbrn,Long drama of friendship and connection and a standout bold turn from Pacino,8,12 September 2019,"""Scent of a Woman"" is one drama that doesn't so much entertain it tries to give a message of connection and friendship showing that those things are often uncommon and unexpected. It's a brash and bold watch seeing Al(in which he has won his only Oscar so far to date) in top notch all pro form as retired Lt. Col Frank Slade who's stubborn set in his ways still despite being blind gets thru life. Enter Charlie(Chris O' Donnell) a young prep student who takes a job on a holiday break in which he takes care and babysits Frank. The scenes and chemistry on screen between Chris and Pacino is often intense with words and actions, still thru it all the drama and differences lead to respect and caring is earned. Also look for an early appearance from the now late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Overall not the greatest film still it's a journey of connection and friendship and it's made watchable by Al's tough stubborn performance.",Scent of a Woman
25,MovieAddict2016,Overrated and tedious,9,28 April 2005,"Al Pacino won his first and only Oscar for ""Scent of a Woman"" in 1992 and he deserved it far more for ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" released the same year. Although he yells a lot in both pictures, the over-the-top screaming was justified by the character in ""Glengarry Glen Ross""; in ""Scent of a Woman,"" his Lt. Col. Frank Slade comes across as a gross caricature, sort of like Robert De Niro in ""This Boy's Life."" Both terrific actors made some mistakes in the 1990s: This was Pacino's largest in my opinion.First of all, like De Niro in ""This Boy's Life,"" Pacino's fake accent is constantly varying from scene to scene. He's supposed to be from the south and has that southern twang in his voice, and pronounces words ""lak dis, y'know."" (In fact, he says ""y'know"" a lot in this movie.) The problem is that the accent comes and goes; sometimes Pacino's got it down-pat, and at other times we feel as though he's playing another character. The end speech in particular careens from Louisiana speech patterns to New York City, y'know.The movie starts off fair enough but it's so sappy and oozing with cheesy sentimentality that, by its finale, I felt as if I'd seen enough and wanted to turn on something else.Because basically I've seen something just like this before. It was called ""Dead Poet's Society"" and it followed the same formula, and carried the same sentimental goo as ""Scent of a Woman."" Chris O'Donnell delivers the best performance of his career, and outstages Pacino. But the movie -- clocking in at nearly three hours! -- really falls apart in the last act.Yes, it's nice to feel refreshed by cinema. Frank Capra got away with this endless times - just look at the final speech by Jimmy Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" The problem is that it's out of place, awkward and unrealistic in ""Scent of a Woman,"" a movie that otherwise proposes it is very real. Pacino rants for about five minutes straight, as if he's reading his lines from ""Witty Catchphrases People Will Remember for Years to Come: For Dummies."" Overall, Martin Brest has made far better character pieces (just look at ""Midnight Run,"" and that was a comedy!) and although ""Scent of a Woman"" is NOT a horrible film by any means, I do believe it's quite overrated and too sappy at times to be altogether memorable. It's okay, and worth watching now and again if it happens to come on television, but don't expect the masterpiece some people have made it out to be. It's really quite average, and follows a formula that's been followed far too many times over the years.",Scent of a Woman
26,thesar-2,Scent of a Winner,10,11 May 2013,"Scent of a Woman is one of those rare movies that I will spend years apart from viewings and fall all over in love with it once it begins again.This beautiful – no, creation – film had so many attributes, it's hard to sum them all up in one review. So many, that this film could be studied as part of a film class's curriculum. It would be easy to just compliment the cinematography, score, dialogue, originality, deep comedy that holds up more than 20 years from its original release, suspense, dramatic themes, depth and character spot on interactions. And while all of those were absolutely astonishing in this fantastic film and each could be dissected in said film class, my favorite aspects of this film are Pacino's iconic role, the remaining acting and the big finale.I used to think that the Oscar Pacino won for this role was a ""pity"" one since both he's had plenty (more than, actually) of extremely fine performances prior and the Academy does, in fact, do that, which is a wrong move. But, taking aside all his previous excellence, he was above and beyond great here as recently blinded Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.While he had me both cracking up and witnessing greatness, the rest of the cast was also very good, namely Chris O'Donnell's quiet, but deep teen role and a just-noticed-by-me Phillip Seymour Hoffman.And finally of my favorites, and one I hope to completely memorize one day – I have about 80% of it down, is the big, climatic showdown. I've already listened to it so many dozens of timesthat it's hard not to shout out at the screen line by line of what Frank is preaching. (I did, this time too. I had to reverse back to enjoy it without my own interrupting.) Now, I don't 100% agree with Frank, or Charlie's stance – if you hadn't seen this by now, I will not spoil it – but Frank's passion and drive and Charlie's uncompromising ethics made me stand behind them one hundred percent.Besides all that, it was a fantastically written scene of heart, humor and depth. It ranks up there with Jack Nicholson's A Few Good Men courtroom scene and Pacino's own The Devil's Advocate's Devilish finale speech.The movie breaks into two separate story lines: One involves angry ex-military Frank Slade and his free spirit bucket list in NYC and prep-school on a scholarship teen Charlie Simms's dilemma on whether or not to rat out fellow students.Charlie reluctantly accepts a ""babysitting"" job of caring for Frank over Thanksgiving so he can earn the plane fare to see his parents over Christmas. Only, he didn't know the ""easy money"" would require chasing blind Frank all over New York City and beyond.The movie's hilarious, touching and makes me emotional every time I watch it. I laugh hard on the lines, marvel on how imperfect Frank is but we still believe in everything he says and enjoy the crisp scenery and movement of the story. Truly, this is one of my all-time favorites.",Scent of a Woman
27,theowinthrop,"I don't know who went here - William Howard Taft, William Jennings Bryan, WilliamTell - It doesn't matter, Their spirit is dead here!",8,14 April 2009,"I will not try to determine what is the best film performance in Al Pacino's career, which included Donnie Brasso and Michael Corleone and Serpico. But his performance as Lt. Col. Frank Slade in SCENT OF A WOMAN must rank among his top ten performances. It was a surprise film performance that captured his second Oscar, and gave new impetus to his career. It is also an interesting view on the importance of character, and how it can be intentionally smashed by those supposed to be building it up.Chris O'Donnell is Charley Simms, a teenager on a scholarship to one of the most elite prep schools in America. He works in the library. One day he and another student are the last two locking up the library, and they see three students (one is Bradley Whitford) trashing an expensive new automobile belonging to the pompous and unlikeable new headmaster Mr. Trask (James Rebhorn). Trask sees the activities and runs to his car, but the three boys scatter. He is pretty certain who they are, but he did not see them clearly. He does stop Charley and the other boy and demands to know what they saw. And here the problem begins that will mushroom until the film ends.Trask is a petty little snot-nose, and wants the heads of the three boys not so much because they did a wrong, but because they held him up to ridicule before the school body. Soon he is pressuring his two ""witnesses"" to cooperate, or face serious consequences (expulsion and probable social ruin). The other boy, your typical rich kid party animal, is weak and under additional pressure from his father (who'll ship him to the military if he does not knuckle under). Charlie is poor, and can be easily swatted, but Trask is willing that if Charlie cooperates there is nothing the school won't do for him when he heads for a high university career.It is Thanksgiving weekend, and Charley is not going home to Oregon. He sees that there is a blind officer who wants to go to New York City for the holiday, and needs an assistant. It is Lt. Col. Slade, and Charley goes to offer his services, only to find Slade a bitter and prickly man. He was once a promising military figure (he was an aide to President Lyndon Johnson) but he lost his eyesight in a stupid trick he was playing, and was retired from the military. Although he has a good pension he feels his life is in tatters.The two go to Manhattan, checking into a first rate hotel, and enjoying the sites (as much as Slade can enjoy it, or Charley for that matter due to the crisis back at the school). But the two click, and Slade begins seeing in Charley the son that he would always have liked to have. Highlights of the trip include a wonderful moment when Charley and Slade (who can pretend he can see) test a magnificent convertible on a deserted twelfth avenue in Manhattan on Sunday morning with Slade driving while Charley keeps an eye on potential dangers. Slade also is still quite the lady's man, the title being a reference to his enhanced sense of smell of women's perfumes.In the end Slade learns what the situation is for Charley, who cannot depend on anyone to help him (his father is long gone from his life, and his step-father could not care less about him). Slade ends up with Charlie at the conclusion - a hearing where Trask is going to break both his witnesses to get at the three guilty parties. And while the other boy somewhat caves in, Charley just can't bring himself to say anything.SPOILER COMING UP: Slade is the one who humiliates Trask. He announces that whatever Charley failed to do to satisfy the little headmaster he was not a snitch, and that the ideals of the school are dying in the hands of the headmaster who'd break the spirit of the boys there for his own pettiness. The quote in the Summary Line is part of Slade's speech, in answer to Trask commenting about the great men who came out of the prep school. What good of having these great men to talk of if the very character building blocks that are sought are demolished by the likes of Trask? Slade points out to the students and teachers that if they leadership they should stick to Charley who won't snitch as opposed to the other fellow and the three idiots who caused the prank but lack the spirit to confess and face punishment. Slade's speech does the trick, and Charley is not punished.In the end one senses the two men will remain close. It seems right that they should.Oh, I kept referring to the other witness without telling who he is. It was a surprise when I watched the film recently. The character, George Wills Jr., is a party animal type - not really bright and his father has paved his way in with money and donations. I knew someone like that in my college - he was a nice guy but a heavy drinker. He died prematurely (before his own father) in 1989, from the results of his heavy drinking. The character of George Wills, Jr., helpless in the hands of his dad and Trask (though he tries to limit the damage of his ""testimony"") was played by the young Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's interesting to see a budding personality of the screen in an early performance of promise. Within fifteen years Hoffman too would have his best acting Oscar.As for my old college acquaintance, this is dedicated to the unfortunate Donald.",Scent of a Woman
28,ElMaruecan82,"The ""City Lights"" of the 90's ... with friendship and integrity as the key messages ...",9,4 July 2011,"My first remembrance of an Academy Award ceremony concurred with my favorite actor winning the Oscar ... but the movie for which he won seemed too serious for the 11-year old boy I was. And with the passing of years, I discovered Al Pacino's glorious filmography, through ""Scarface"", ""The Godfather"" trilogy, ""Carlito's Way"", ""Heat"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Serpico""  and ""Scent of a Woman"" for a mysterious reason was a movie that I wasn't in a hurry to watch. How wrong I was : as soon as I finally finished the film, I knew I just saw Al Pacino's role that cut straight into my heart the most directly, after Michael Corleone.""Scent of a Woman"" is a two-hour and half movie that never seems too long because it absolutely knows where it goes. The slow pacing is important as it provides enough time to be familiar with the two main characters : Chris O'Donnell as Charlie Simms, a shy young 17-year old boy who studies on aid in Baird, a prestigious prep school and Al Pacino as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, a flamboyant, crude and rude war veteran blind since an accidental drunk game. They couldn't have been more opposite but as we expect in a script whose intelligence emanates from the first minutes, we'll get to know more beyond these archetypal facades and each character will learn about and from the other. It's a coming of age story lead by one of the most memorable and inspiring characters of the last decade : Colonel Slade, with his priceless onomatopoeic motto : ""Hoo-ah!"".Charlie Simms is an insecure student whose modest background impacted his personality. He's surrounded by arrogant daddy's boys, among them, George Willis, a young scene-stealing Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Charlie's financial situation makes him an obvious outcast in the prestigious Baird School, forced to accept a weekend job, to earn money. His job would be to nurse a grumpy and totally obnoxious old man, unknowing that he's just about to live the most important days in his life, with New York as the setting. Meanwhile, he and George happen to be the unintentional witnesses of the setting of what would be a humiliating prank. The victim is played by the ultimate character actor of the 90's, James Rebhorn as Trask, the school's headmaster. Charlie and George have all the weekend to think about the eventuality of denouncing their friends under the threat of exclusion, an unbearable ethic dilemma for Charlie. And we quite understand the incertitude and anguish he'll display all through his trip with Colonel Slade.The movie literally takes off when Charlie and Slade move to New York, and we get to know more about the Colonel and understand the fascination he inspires us. He's a man whose blindness developed other sensory powers that target one specific category of persons : women. No other character spoke of women like Colonel Slade, who developed a particular ability to identify any feminine fragrance. The trip to New York will be the opportunity for Charlie to have a small taste of all the pleasures that can govern our lives : eating, drinking, dancing a tango with a beautiful girl like Donna, a name that resonates as a probable homage to the original Italian movie, Dino Risi's ""Profumo di Donna"" and speaking of Italians, there is also riding a Ferrari, and trying an awkward but sincere reconciliation with the family, and ultimately fighting the inner demons. Beyond the whole mentor-disciple relationship, darker undertones are hidden : Slade's eagerness to seize each hour, each moment of the precious weekend, are the morbid allegory of the last meal before execution. Slade basically savors some last pleasures before shooting himself to death. And then it's time for Charlie to overcome his passive nature before it's too late.This is the aspect that definitely marks the movie's greatness. Slade learns that we never have nothing to lose for suicide is the ultimate failure, and a total waste because nothing is never worth to be enjoyed just because we're blind, crippled, or have no money. Simms mirrors Slade's condition during a heartbreaking climactic moment that will consolidate their friendship, when both of them are in dead-ends. Simms learns that George's father will probably interfere and that he might defend his case alone but how could Slade be in a dead end, with all he taught to Charlie during a memorable weekend. These scenes are realistically handled, avoiding what could have been cinematic stereotypical sappiness. And at these moments, you understand that no other actor could have played the character with such fierce intensity in his lifeless eyes.The movie concludes with the resolution of the Baird case where Slade, as a moral debt, decided to defend his protégé and new friend Charlie. In one hell of a speech like only Al Pacino, with his volcanic voice, could have delivered, he spits on the hypocrisy of a system that condemns the high morality of a boy who refuses to snitch, and spare the one who talked, under the control of daddy. It's Kirkland, Wortzik and Serpico resurrecting in a histrionic virtuosity and metamorphosing a bunch of puppets-students into wannabe men. The movie's inspirational message of integrity rewards two hours of a patient character study as finally, Charlie Simms also opened the eyes of Colonel Slade during that weekend.And as many noticed, there's the beautiful melody of ""City lights"" that inhabits the film. I think this is also a nice touch that reminded us of the true universal message that I mentioned in my review of Chaplin's masterpiece, quoting the French writer Antoine de Saint Exupery : ""it is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye"", that's what Charlie's initiation, a lesson even Colonel Slade was about to forget, but fortunately, did not.

The performance he delivered in Scent of a Woman would have blown his other performances into outer space. That's how good he was in this movie. If it wasn't for Al, this movie would probably not be very good.This film is about a prep school kid who needs money. He decides to get a job that deals with caring for a blind man. But what happens was not the job description the kid had in mind...Of course, Al Pacino is the star of this movie and he essentially carried this movie. His speech at the end of the film certainly got him the Oscar. He really took a risky part and it played off. I didn't like Chris O'Donnell too much.

It does undermine you by trying to manipulate your emotions by having a blind man as a lead character. It's easy to feel sympathy for a blind man, and for that it does manage to be manipulating. But it's so adroit with how it is executed I didn't care in the long run. Despite its manipulative nature, you can't help but feel sympathy for Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) and Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) because of their predicaments. I've seen a few reviewers compare this a bit to Dead Poets Society. That is true to a certain extent. It does resemble it a little bit, but like Dead Poets Society, Scent of A Woman manages to trigger major emotions out of you. Despite a couple of gripes, Al Pacino deserved his Oscar. He nails it 95% of the time, and gives a powerful performance, which is unforgettable. His gruff character is very memorable, and his great chemistry with the young Chris O'Donnell was vital. Their journey was a joy to watch. My favorite scene with the two of them was the Ferrari scene. I didn't see the need for the ""Hoo-Hah"" from Pacino, or some of the incessant yelling he would do at times. Some scenes called for it, and others didn't. His performance as a blind man is thoroughly impressive. He looked like a blind man, and I didn't think it was Al Pacino. He also has some classic monologue in the ending. It's a very powerful speech to say the least. I always felt The Godfather was overrated, so his Oscar here was deserved, and I felt he was better here, which is most likely a very unpopular opinion, but oh well. Chris O'Donnell is pretty good for the most part. He does have too much of a stupid, bewildered look on his face at times, but he has many good scenes that make up for it. I'm not a fan of his at all, ever since he was a nuisance as Robin in Batman, but he was good here. Bradley Whitford does what he does in a lot of roles, play a jerk, whilst Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a vital part in one of his early roles.

I can't say with certainty, but I think this is one of those instances where the film transcends the book, as it has remained in my living memory for decades, while the impressions of reading the novel have long faded. A high school student is taking the job of accompanying a blind retired officer over the weekend, unaware that this seemingly harmless task will turn into an adventure that will change both of their lives.As a kid I was thrilled with the Ferrari scene, as a teenager I was enthralled by Pacino's tango with Gabrielle Anwar, and now I was blown away by Pacino's frightening plausibility in the role of a blind man (no dark glasses), and by that I mean not just facial expression, but the whole range of emotions that he handled with incredible ease. The story itself and the message it carries are nothing special, and the technical aspects of the film are not particularly impressive, but besides Pacino's performance, you will not pay attention to anything else anyway.8/10",Scent of a Woman
34,Dr_Coulardeau,"Poignant, sensitive, emotional, heart raking",10,30 September 2009,"This one is a masterpiece. First of all because Al Pacino cuts a character he is in no way close to being in real life. He plays a retired lieutenant-colonel which is nothing, but a blind one. His blindness is the symbol, and result, of both a heroic career and a sad end because he was passed over for general. This mixture of so many emotions and feelings and frustrations is marvelously conveyed by the actor. His tone, his behavior, his general stand, his unpredictable reactions, his decision to leave this world and his second decision to stay can be read in the way he speaks, the words he uses, the expressions his blind face carries, his attitudes toward other people, etc. He is a millionaire in emotions. But it is a masterpiece for so many other reasons that I am only going to quote a few. First it is a journey, the journey of a prep school teenager, a student on a scholarship mind you, from Oregon to Cambridge, Massachusetts, then to New York, a round trip with the colonel he is taking care of for the Thanksgiving long week end. This journey, and particularly the lap to New York and the subsequent events, are an initiation. The young chap is to learn what principles are in life and that you have to stand by them, especially if you are poor and fragile in body and social status: then be strong in soul and mind and spirit. Your ethics are your only asset and power in life. He also has to learn how to understand his colonel companion and feel when he has decided to send him buy cigars while he is putting an end to his life and the gun loaded with his bullets are an impressive key to the solitary tower of growing up with death in front of you. He saves that man with a crazy idea of a ride, for a blind man, to drive a Ferrari in the Bronx or somewhere under the Brooklyn Bridge, and with all the frills of such a ride including the cop who catches him speeding but does not realize he is talking to a blind man. But this film is also a film about the elite education these Ivy League prep schools provide the young men of today with to prepare them to be the leaders of tomorrow. There I will not hint too much at that side of the story. Let's say an act of vandalism which is a student prank and nothing more, leads the headmaster into menacing the two student witnesses (our poor one and a rich kid) with the worst punishment going as far as trying to buy the cooperation of the poor student. The final disciplinary hearing is absurd in its logic. The three culprits go through because there is no clear cut witness, the rich one, with his father, pretends he did not have his contacts on but gives the three names with a maybe, and the poor one, Charlie by the way, refuses point blank to be a fink, a stool pigeon. And there the intervention of his would-be-and-could-have-been-suicidee colonel saves the day. That you will have to find out by yourself. In many ways it is a lot stronger than the Dead Poets Society and the drama is avoided. It is better because it is the vision of a poor scholarship student and not the vision of one rich kid, in recent society and not in the 1920s or so. The point of view makes it a lot more powerful about society and courage, even if less dramatic as for the relations between the rich kid and his father. The loser all along is the headmaster who did not know how to recognize a prank and over-estimated it into an act of vandalism. Yes that kind of repressive attitude produces soul cripples and there is no prosthesis for that type of amputation.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Scent of a Woman
35,eddie_baggins,Melodramatic but affecting,7,3 July 2016,"Made famous by the fact it featured a grandstanding Oscar winning Al Pacino performance and the career making turns of future Robin Chris O'Donnell and future Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run director Martin Brest's Scent of a Woman is a film that by today's standards is a tad too over the top and melodramatic to be highly praised but it's an at times affecting and emotionally powerful portrait of friendship and finding ones place in the world.Drawing out a seemingly simple set up of odd couple pair in the form of Pacino's blind and disgraced former Army Colonel Frank Slade and O'Donnell's baby faced and non-worldly wise prep school student/makeshift babysitter Charlie Simms going on a life changing weekend trip into a 2 and a half hour meditation on living, loving and tango dancing, Brest struggles to maintain a consistent momentum to the flow of the movie and after a lengthy lead up and a downright cheesy finale, Scent of a Woman stays afloat and becomes something more than it perhaps deserves to be thanks to Pacino and O'Donnell's intriguing partnering.In what's the very incarnation of an award baiting role, Pacino walks the very fine line of parody and an acting masterclass as the cantankerous and feisty Slade and while he walked away with the golden statue at the1993 Oscars it's hard to say how his performance would be regarded had it come to fruition in today's climate but one suspects a golden statue would not have fallen in his direction.It's a committed performance by Pacino but his over reliance on yelling of the phrase ""hoo-wah"" is nicely counteracted by O'Donnell's dialled down (sometimes too much so) turn as the well-meaning Charlie. Between the two actors they find a nice middle ground and make the hard to believe central premise of Scent work despite the fact it's never far away from being purely fanciful in terms of character decisions and the aforementioned over staged finale involving a college court of law.For all committed Pacino fans Scent of a Woman is must watch as it features the actors most flashy performance outside of Scarface and acts as a reminder as to just how dominate the now sporadically entertaining actor could be as well as a showcase for O'Donnell, who just never quite went on with the talent he showed in his early career.As for director Martin Brest whose career story is now Hollywood lore, Scent of a Woman marked the last noteworthy entry into the filmmaker's short filmography that was put to a swift and sad end by the one two double pronged attack of cinematic stinkers Meet Joe Black and notorious movie crime that was the 2003 Bennifer led Gigli.3 ½ intense tango's out of 5",Scent of a Woman
36,filipemanuelneto,An uplifting and emotional film,8,22 November 2016,"This film is very interesting and does not only have an analysis or a possible reading. It focuses on the experience of a young student (Chris O'Donnell) who accepts the job of taking care of a blind old man to earn some extra money. He reluctantly accepts the job after verifying that the old man is an army veteran, lieutenant colonel, and that his abrupt and rude manners would be difficult to bear. It gets worse when colonel decides to travel with his new ""recruit"" without care about his thoughts in these matter. However, they are not so different. Both show a tremendous sense of honor, duty, and dignity that permeates throughout the film at various times. This feeling, in a way, will allow both to understand each other better and establish a friendship. Another strong feature in the film is the enormous taste that the old colonel has for feminine companionship, and that is the origin of some of the most memorable phrases of the dialogues of the film.Chris O'Donnell and Al Pacino worked very well together, but Al Pacino dominates the film completely, with a delivery, a professionalism, a talent difficult to match. It is not surprising because he is already an established actor and with evidence given in the artistic world. However, in this film, he certainly got one of the most significant works of his career, along with the films of ""The Godfather"" trilogy. On a technical level, the film is fairly regular, but I would highlight cinematography, with a discreet but competent use of light and color, giving the film an elegant look that values ​​without distracting the audience from the story itself. And here is the story, the script, what counts and what matters. An edifying story, where values ​​and honor are at the heart of the plot.",Scent of a Woman

About Al's blindness, I will just say that sometimes, he overplays his hands but from start to finish, he's exceptional with his eyes: he really seems to see nothing.Beyond, this movie combines two themes that are special to me: boarding school and NYC. It's not often that you can have a movie that excels in those categories simultaneously: It's as much about a student's life as a trip in uptown NYC. As a lot of Al's late movie, he embodies a fatherly figure for a young disoriented. But, here, the cards are a bit different: Al can be as supportive as he is stern and very difficult. If he speaks not very clearly, you can guess that he has a great life behind and you understand that Al is in a fight against time that he can't win. In front of him, O'Donnell is perfect as the All-American boy. Thus, it's the delicate meeting of courage and integrity and it's really moving to see the two characters taking each other's influence.

38,SAMTHEBESTEST,Classy Al Pacino in mainstream beautiful tango tale of life.,7,21 September 2020,"Scent Of A Woman (1992) :
Brief Review -Classy Al Pacino in mainstream beautiful tango tale of life. I knew Al Pacino for Classy performances in Dog Day Afternoon, The Godfather and Heat but Scent Of A Woman eventually showed me his new colours. The man who can be a deadly don and a funky robber can also be a great arrogant fella with disciplinary actions is proved here. I might not remember this film for it's mainstream storyline and genuine methods but Al Pacino definitely made a difference here to look forward and to recall. Scent Of A Woman is about a Blind man who hates his boring life and the so called civilised people around him and he meets a young confused and quite less confident lad to take care of him for the weekend. The journey to New York sums up some problems of thier lives and individually they both return with some different thoughts about life. There is nothing wrong in the life theories but there is nothing special too. It's just another favourable genuine Storyline dealing with same problems set in different places and situations. The overall narrative does the justice to the context of the script and the screenplay doesn't fall flat despite having long runtime of over 150 minutes. This could be a problem if I have to watch the film again, i might not stay constant for 156 minutes because the flow seems slow sometimes and over the top occassionally. Performance wise Al Pacino shows his Class, Chris O'Donnell stands best after him and rest of the cast is so so. Martin Brest could have brought more intelligence if wanted and the same narrative would have became memorable stuff but for now it is something less to it's real potential. It has a few nasty and tango moments but it just disappear quickly. Overall, Scent Of A Woman is a great watch anyway but Al Pacino adds something to remember.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",Scent of a Woman
39,matthewssilverhammer,Old Blind Men Be Horny,5,27 November 2017,"I always heard that Pacino's Oscar win for this role was mostly a lifetime achievement award, but I actually think he's pretty incredible here, as are all of the performances (LITTLE BABY SEYMOUR Hoffman!). Otherwise, the movie is clichéd and corny. Other than a couple of effective moments (Thanksgiving dinner), this is mostly an abundantly false (gun-hotel scene) 90's drama that was just begging for (and getting) awards with every hoo-wah.",Scent of a Woman
40,insomniac_rod,A lesson of life. An Extraordinary film.,10,21 November 2004,"This is an extraordinary film. I can't think of enough adjectives to praise ""Scent of a Woman"". You can watch it with high expectations and you will feel pleased.*SPOILERS Col. Lt. Slade is a man angered with life and has infinite bitterness towards his pyyiscal disability. The man knows how to give himself a good life but it seems that it just doesn't fills him. In an exquisite way, Lt. Slade reveals that his passions are traveling, Tango, women, and cars. It may sound superficial that life's about that (in fact it's not) but Frank Slade displays a feeling of tenderness and liberation when doing them. The Tango scene speaks by itself and it's one of the most wonderful moments in the film. Also check the Porsche action sequence. It's fun and intense.His depression is very deep that he even considers committing suicide.After Lt. Slade meets Charlie his point of view towards life changes as the young man teaches him that life is worth to live even if you are physically disabled. Lt. Slade realizes that he is a man blessed with many gifts and he can see through people's feelings. In my opinion, the best moment in the movie is the powerful scene where Lt. Slade comes in defense of Charlie against Bert's directors and the honorable table. Obviously Charlie is a victim of bourgeoisy; unfairness is against him because he's a loyal, honest, and humild school mate. Mr. Trask and George Willis's father take advantage on the naive student and when Mr. Trask is about to recommend Charlie's expel from Bert, Frank Slade enters aided by Manny and sits next to Charlie as his tutor. Slade gives a powerful, intense, and moving speech. When Mr. Trask yells to Lt. Slade that ""he's out of order"", Frank starts his memorable speech. Let me refresh your mind by writing it:""Out of order, I show you out of order. You don't know what out of order is, Mr. Trask. I'd show you, but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too f***in' blind. If I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a FLAMETHROWER to this place! Out of order? Who the hell do you think you're talking' to? I've been around, you know? There was a time I could see. And I have seen. Boys like these, younger than these, their arms torn out, their legs ripped off. But there isn't nothing' like the sight of an amputated spirit. There is no prosthetic for that. You think you're merely sending this splendid foot soldier back home to Oregon with his tail between his legs, but I say you are... executin' his soul! And why? Because he's not a Bairdman. Bairdmen. You hurt this boy, you're gonna be Baird bums, the lot of ya. And Harry, Jimmy, Trent, wherever you are out there, F**YOU TOO! "" (IMDB - Memorable quotes).You need to watch the movie to feel the whole experience. ""Scent of a Woman"" is a movie that masterfully displays drama, comedy, sadness, and makes you feel positive towards everything for a moment.ACTING. Pacino's performance is WONDERFUL. No wonder why he got the Oscar for Best Actor. He has the charm to make the audience laugh, cry, and really feel his pain. You either love or get annoyed by his character at the beginning as he's very sarcastic, cold, and mean sometimes. As the movie evolves you totally feel symphaty for him and you can't help but ask for more of the character's personality. A delightful performance, period. Hands down to Mr. Al Pacino.Chris O'Donnell (Charlie Simms) gives also a wonderful performance. The young man looked mature for a role of this difficulty. His innocence and decision were totally believed. When his dramatic abilities are required he delivers perfectly. When he has to deliver a decent performance when Mr. Pacino steals the scene because of his huge acting capacity; he delivers and never gets opaqued or dulled by Pacino. In my opinion, it's O'Donnell's best role to date.DIRECTION. Martin Brest's direction is very stylish with the Hollywoodesque technique but it has a feeling. The movie looks beautiful and it's cinematography makes the movie look attractive for the eye. Brest knew how to create a powerful drama with the necessary touch of comedy. ""Scent of a Woman"" is an easy watch that will active all your emotions. Great job Mr. Brest. Check out also Gabrielle Anwar's brief appearance. She surely enlightens the screen with her extreme beautiness. Wow, what a woman. The ending will also leave you satisfied.This is one of those movies that you can watch 1000 times and you don't get bored. There's always something new to find on it.10/10. An important and sometimes overlooked (by the Gen. X) film. Recommended FOR EVERYONE. It will move and provoke on you an internal reflexion of how you act towards life and it's burdens.",Scent of a Woman
41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Thrives on Pacino's iconic Col. Frank Slade,7,8 February 2010,"Squarely on the shoulders of Al Pacino rests ""Scent of a Woman,"" a film of unlikely friendship and moral education spanning an epic 187 minutes. It is film built on memorable quotes and moments from Oscar-winning ""One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest"" adapter Bo Goldman as well as one unforgettable performance.Though its length deflates a lot of its punch, there's a great humor driving ""Scent of a Woman."" Pacino's portrayal is magnetizing and reckless -- the master of on-camera shouting perfecting his craft. You laugh because he makes you uncomfortable, he's blind and his dialogue is, well, frank. He speaks his mind because he's not afraid of the consequences. He enjoys the pleasures of life, particularly women, he drinks without abandon and yet there's an uncanny wisdom in everything he says or does. Sometimes an exceptional character study can make a movie and Pacino's Col. Slade certainly does.The film is about how a young man at a prestigious east-coast boarding school (Chris O'Donnell) ends up taking a random babysitting job to earn some cash during Thanksgiving break as opposed to forking out for the plane ticket back to Oregon. His assignment is of course Uncle Frank, who flips the weekend upside down when he swoops off with him to New York City where Frank has some plans to live it up -- and teach the young Charlie a thing or two.Unlikely friendships are the stuff of many great films and although ""Scent of a Woman"" really pushes these two clashing personalities together, it's not without the best of intent. Charlie's subplot is that he's leaving a big scandal behind at school during the break in which he has was interrogated by the headmaster as to who pulled a big prank. (The other witness is his friend George, played by a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman.) The headmaster has hung the threat of rescinding Charlie's recommendation to Harvard over Charlie's head and it his decision of whether to snitch becomes the moral dilemma that Frank will eventually assist him with.There are great scenes in ""Scent of a Woman"" from the ruckus at Thanksgiving dinner when Frank takes Charlie, both uninvited, to his brother's house where the relatives don't think much of him to Frank teaching a young woman to tango or at one point driving a Ferrari despite being blind. Memorable moments they are, but all relevant and all worthy of every second being drawn out? No. Director Martin Brest (""Beverly Hills Cop"") could've cut at least a half hour from this film. Each scene concludes after the audience has already figured out what will happen.The things that Frank teaches Charlie (and of course vice-versa) are lessons of great moral significance. There's no denying you could quote this film over and over again whether it's Frank shouting ""Hoo-ah!"" or his ""there are two kinds of people in this world"" speech. At the same time, scripted wisdom is not what makes a film great and that's why greatness eludes ""Scent of a Woman."" What we learn from the film we do not learn through empathy or in an organic or home-grown manner. It doesn't make the pearls any less valuable or interesting, they're just deprived of a blossoming epiphany.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Scent of a Woman

43,jzappa,The Al Pacino Show,7,1 January 2007,"The reason this film is so well liked is because of Al Pacino's performance, and the reason his performance is so well liked is because he plays that sort of character that's loud, rude, uninhibited, and crassly funny, the type of person that makes a scene in a place and doesn't seem to realize it. Audiences love this type of character, even when this character is in a supporting role or even a bit part, over the entire rest of the cast, which they will end up almost completely overlooking, because there's something about such a fiery individual with no manners and provokes looks from other tables in fancy restaurants and other things like that that they find upliftingly funny. The problem is that the writers, not to mention Pacino, know this about audiences and almost go a little too far with the likable, rebellious older guy. Making multiple efficient high-speed turns in downtown New York City would be impossible for a blind man to perform without crashing, even with a young man accustomed to the car coaching him. But it's a cool notion that even if Pacino is blind, he can still rock a Ferrari. It would be highly unlikely that Headmaster Trask would need to rely on witness testimony to find out who was responsible for the paint-balloon gag. It would be more efficient to get to the perpetrators by means of the person(s) responsible for the loud speaker. But it's better to have a reason for Pacino showing up and sticking it to the man.Al Pacino is one of the contemporary classic scene stealers, up there with Brando, De Niro, Malkovich, Hoffman, Depp, and Nicholson, and because of his naturally entertaining performance in a two-and-a-half-hour movie playing the likable, rebellious older guy, Scent of a Woman isn't really Scent of a Woman. It's really The Al Pacino Show. Every other actor and actress in the film seems difficult to comment on, because when all we're supposed to focus on is Al, it's as if everyone else is a stick figure.Scent of a Woman is actually a very good film, a good-spirited character piece, a drama with its even sprinkles of wry Pacino humor, and Pacino's character is actually quite a realistic man in a realistic situation. It's really not deeply felt. Martin Brest has never been a good enough director to make something very deep, but he's very good at making highly satisfactory Hollywood schlock entertainment. Scent of a Woman is above average schlock, possibly a fine holiday season film.",Scent of a Woman

What hurts, is just now, I've learnt this was a remake, but I'm gonna let that slide. What you'll love about this movie is the acting. Pacino is magnificent, showing us what an Oscar winning performance, as a legendary, grouchy retired colonel, who I guess played with one too many hand grenades, which led to his blindness. Accompanying him on a trip, at Pacino's request, is a handsome college kid (Chris O Donnell) an actor who couldn't be more perfect for the role. He needs the money, and applies for the job of looking after the Colonel, unaware of him being grouch and irascible. The other take note performance, was that of a younger Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who with O'Donnell, are put on a stand near the end, as witnesses to a vandalism of their college Dean, where they are caught between lagging and accepting consequences, where for O'Donnell, it's a short cut to ending his promising career. Pacino steps in beautifully with this, backing Charlie (O Donnell) his new friend. This film is an adventure and teaches the value of life, and the aspect of not taking it for granted too, while being in Pacino's blind shoes. Of course the real beauty of this film, was the woman with the beautiful scent, Anwar, halfway through the peace, Pacino's lines here, magnificent, in what is a great script.

Everything doesn't have to be childish and stupid and ADHD, children will understand things with a bit of a head on it.Rant aside, what the heck happened here? Chris O'Donnell can act. He can hold his ground against old Al in one of his most celebrated roles. Why isn't he getting better roles? He deserves them, he's got talent.And he's kind of a local boy so...I have to support him. Winnetka is close enough and it's nice to see people from the neighborhood and around the neighborhood make it big.Moving on....Folks argue about Al's role, but he was brilliant. You even got to hear him scream and yell in an angry diatribe at the end of the flick and, regardless of his talent...that IS what you want to see when you shell out for one of his movies.He can do the old bard...but you want to see him do the angry man.And then, moving beyond this....it is beautiful.

O'Donnell only wants to earn a few extra bucks, but his ward has other ideas, using the boy as a human guide dog for one final fling of high living before falling on his sword, so to speak. The usually reliable Al Pacino gives a disappointing, one-note performance as lieutenant colonel Frank Slade, but there isn't much he could have done with a character whose craving for double whiskeys, tough talk, and (in his words) 'pussy' is meant to be a romantic attachment to wine, women, and song. Bo Goldman's masochistic screenplay is likewise a big letdown, packed full of maudlin self-pity and ending not in suicide, of course, but in a self-congratulatory standing ovation by the entire student body of O'Donnell's school, after which everyone goes home to presumably wait for their Oscar nominations.

As a good part of this film depicts school life without resorting to caricatures, one learns that it is the poor and weak students who are destroyed because of their integrity. This film also features an ""American style philosophy"" about honesty and integrity in the form of a brilliant speech delivered by Al Pacino who depicts all kinds of emotions ranging from anger, desperation and frustration. His performances are as meaningful and pertinent in 2014 as they were in 1993 when he won best actor Oscar for this film.

50,jimbo-53-186511,"Al Pacino puts in another tour-de-force performance in a flawed, but very impressive film",7,27 September 2015,"A cash-strapped student Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) takes a weekend job babysitting blind retired lieutenant-colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino). However, Charlie wasn't expecting Frank to decide to up and leave to New York albeit with a spare ticket for Charlie. Being the dutiful minder, Charlie tags along with Frank to New York which ultimately turns out to be a journey that Charlie is unlikely to forget.The story itself is rather predictable and is something we've seen time and time again; a buddy film where one party is naive and wet behind the ears and the other party is a hard-assed tough as nails individual whereby a personality clash immediately ensues. Of course the two individuals gradually bond and find some common ground (the narrative has to swing this way otherwise there wouldn't be much of a film). Despite the clichéd storyline, Scent From A Woman rises above these clichés and is a very good film for several reasons...I've no idea what the novel is like, but I thought that Bo Goldman's screenplay was pretty good and what I liked about it is that for the most part it is free from schmaltz and cheese. With Frank being blind, it would have been very easy to have turned this into a pity piece which not only would have made it a weaker film, but it probably would have made the film a waste of Al Pacino's talents. The film essentially has two strands to its story; 1) There is Frank's desire to live life to the full and 2) The various life-lessons that are experienced and shared between Charlie and Frank. Point 1 is quite fun, but doesn't offer enough to carry the film, but point 2 is really where the film is at its strongest. Although its heavily suggested that Frank is giving Charlie the life-lessons I believe that Charlie also gave Frank some valuable life-lessons too. For me, Frank was like a father-figure to Charlie and helped toughen him up and helped him to see things from a different perspective. Whereas Charlie made Frank realise that he had more to live for than he'd initially assumed - his excellent dancing skills, his gift of the gab etc. I think the question that is being asked here is would Charlie and Frank's lives have been different had they never met? Have they come away from their weekend together as better people? My answer to that question is Yes, but I realise this is purely subjective.Pacino's performance was amazing here and I always feel that portraying a blind person convincingly is a very difficult thing to pull off, but Pacino does it effortlessly. He shouts a lot here, but unlike his cartoonish performance in Scarface it works here (firstly because he is a retired lieutenant-colonel who is used to barking orders at people and more importantly because he's blind - he doesn't know how far people are away from him when he's speaking to them). O'Donnell does his best, but he is no match for Pacino - although he is good in the scene where he's talking Frank out of killing himself.As much as I enjoyed this film, I feel I need to draw your attention to some flaws with this picture; although Frank isn't necessarily painted as a pity figure here, I did find him to be somewhat of a martyr and not the most likable of individuals - this is made worse when we learn that he's always been an asshole which sometimes made his character a difficult person to care about. The Kangaroo Court scene at the end of the film was quite enjoyable, but was a little too Hollywood for my liking.Still this film gets a lot more right than wrong and although it isn't the most uplifting of films, it's a film that is funny, chilling, and heartfelt at various stages and is a film that is worthy of your time.",Scent of a Woman
51,Cristi_Ciopron,Charming and bland,6,13 September 2012,"Heartwarming cheap cinema, an artless remake of an Italian rather merciless comedy, 'Scent ' is standard Hollywood fare, undistinguished as artistry—and immensely charming, rousing, engrossing—yeah, I mean that tango scene, and Pacino in one of his maniacal dispositions.'Scent ' boasts worthy leftovers from the original script, and a lead doing a role that is, to Gassman's original, what Pacino's villain in 'Dick Tracy' is to Jago—or even to Richard III.Everything shocking in the Gassman original was tamed, the point of that movie was missed, perhaps deliberately, or failing to interest the American filmmakers, and the Pacino remake's tone is bland; the Gassman movie was fun, the Pacino one is charming and enjoyable, though bland. Masturbation jokes are a trademark of the Italian movies—they are still in 'Maléna'. Nothing left in the American rendering. The Italian original is a bitter comedy, breathtakingly reasonable and grounded, good—sensed, intensely sad, and benefiting from a somewhat better actor—anyway, one from a wholly different acting tradition or school. The Hollywoodian remake is a bit stained by blandness, a certain childishness.My writing on this site has become somewhat loose and careless—not to mention unduly self—referential—for which there's no better apology than improvement, the restoration of a more impersonal shape, and of a tauter style.",Scent of a Woman

53,drystyx,poor movie all around,2,29 January 2007,"This is just a poor movie all across the board, in writing, acting, directing, everything. It starts with a poor plot and poor writing. Don't look for a plot. There isn't one. The best summary would be that a lot of bratty college kids make life miserable for a half way decent one. One of the two leads proclaims about the other (in the finale) ""He isn't a snitch!"" It's obviously supposed to be some great moment, but it isn't. The moral being not to snitch in any circumstance. In this circumstance, the snitchery would indeed be just unexplainably rotten snitchery, but the proclamation seems to want to justify not telling about any crime. The entire script is concocted as if to make a comraderie, but it doesn't work. And the situation of a blind man driving a car is stupid at best. That leads to the poor acting. Pacino only wants to be a pretty boy (even in ""Scarface"" he was just a pretty boy). His handling of the proclamation, the blind driving, the other situations where he is always angry, just don't ring true. They don't work. Maybe a great actor could make this work. Maybe Cary Grant, Robert Duvall, Robert de Niro, or others past and present. I doubt it, but they might have made the character at least 10% plausible. Pacino doesn't. He fails miserably. Of course the material is some of the worst. That also shows bad editing and directing. They must have taken the worst cuts from each scene. The characters are mostly stereotypes.",Scent of a Woman

Marty Brest hasn't lost his flair for comedy, and Thomas Newman's score is effective, however the film fails simply because we can't feel compassion for the obnoxious Colonel, rather we end up feeling sorry for young Charlie, who has to put up with him.

He's a legendary actor and they give him the biggest of pity Oscars for this mess of generic storytelling and cringey Pacino performances. Scent of a Woman follows as O'Donnell and Pacino become close and Pacino helps O'Donnell find a new lease and understanding on life. There's nothing new or original here, nothing spectacular about it. There is a lot of creepy dialogue from Pacino about women and other things he relates to woman. I mean he plays one horny dude in this. Also, not sure if this is the birth of the 'Hoo-ah!' But lord is it all over this movie.I'm mad about Scent of a Woman. I'm mad because Pacino won the Oscar here. I'm mad because people who aren't familiar with his better work, like myself not too long ago, might think to visit his Oscar winning performance first and that would be a shame. The man is a legendary actor and this is a slap in the face of a win and the whole time I'm watching it I couldn't get that out of my head. It's a generic movie with a lot of baggage and I think the only reason to actually watch it is so you can have a true example of how ridiculous the academy is and has been for so long now.",Scent of a Woman

57,nycritic,Without a Scent,7,15 June 2006,"American cinema, in its quest to rip off Foreign classics, re-packages them in neat little heart-shaped boxes containing chocolate bon-bons ready to be eaten by the public in delectable, saccharine-sweet flavors. It's a practice that by the time of this writing has gone past the European sensibility and zeroed in on Asian horror movies. However, it was only time before it would turn its copy machine's sick-green light unto itself and remake everything on the face of the (American) Earth ranging from here-to-fore untouchable classics to the worst television show.SCENT OF A WOMAN is (surprise, surprise) a remake of an Italian film from 1974 called PROFUMO DI DONNA which translates as ""The Perfume of a Woman"" or basically the same American title. That film was up for the Academy Award for Best Fcreign Language film (it lost to Kurosawa's DERZU UZALA). This film was up for a little more, including acting nods for Al Pacino, into his eighth nomination for Best Actor, and who's best work has been left behind in the Seventies. It promoted the appearance of Gabrielle Anwar, possibly as a way to lure audiences into the theatres, a sure sign a movie by itself can't stand on its own.It sounds like I don't like this movie. I don't, but I don't dislike it either. The problem with such a film as this is that any real essence has been sucked dry and it looks like an exercise in artificiality peppered with an actor's overpowering persona vying one last time for a golden statuette. It's too bad Pacino won for this movie; if the Academy had wanted to honor him they should have been paying more attention to his acting in any film of the Seventies (take your pick) or GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS.

He means to spend a weekend on the town, having just about what the hell he likes from good food and fast cars to loose women. We wants it all; because in the end he means to shoot himself.Al Pacino plays Colonel Slade. Some time in the recent past, in an excess of recklessness, he played a game with hand-grenades and it all went terribly wrong. Now he is blind. And he's in a blind fury. A proud man of action is doomed to creep about with a white stick and he just can't bear it any more. He is still young - late 30's to early 40's - and the prospect of a life of blindness is too much to face.He lives in a kind of annexe to a house in the suburbs with some family. Unaware of his plans, they are going away for the weekend and advertise for a student on the local campus to keep him company for a fee. Luckless Charlie Simms draws the short straw.Pacino delivers a performance of such over-the-top methodology that if you sit too close to the screen you risk being knocked out of your chair. It has all of the explosive unpredictability of 'Goodfellas' or 'Resevoir Dogs'. He is almost a hand-grenade in his own right. Charlie Simms, on the other hand, is his complete opposite. Superbly played by Chris O'Donnell; he's quiet, polite, sensitive and propitiatory - almost a sucker, given the wrong company. Each is a perfect foil for the other, but connect in the one quality that most matters to them both: honour.In other ways Slade has adjusted to blindness very well. He is good at detecting body language. His hearing is extremely acute. And his sense of smell is almost supernatural - especially in regard to women's perfume.Together this odd couple barge through the weekend in a wonderful mutual learning-curve. Most of Slade's family despise him. If he was an arrogant cuss before, blindness has made him a bitter one. Now he's pretty much insufferable. We follow him and his protégé on a series of mostly hilarious adventures during which Slade's terminal intentions gradually become clear.At the same time, Charlie Simms has issues of his own. He witnessed a prank at college of which a despised member of staff was the butt. Those who did the prank have rich fathers who can pull strings. He, on the other hand, has no-one. It seems highly likely that he will be the scapegoat. There's even a chance he might be expelled.That sounds like a job for the colonel.You can hardly fail to like this movie. It's a little disjointed in parts, but from the pleasant theme music, and all of the other technical elements, down to the quality of acting and subtle resolution of the story, it wins you over with its completeness and its human empathy. Some charming little cameos from the likes of Gabrielle Anwar perfectly complement the two lead roles.Though I only give it 8 stars it is still one of my favourites.",Scent of a Woman

Frank Slade with Donna and the meeting in the college where Lt.Col. Slade defends his friend Charlie Simms !! And recently I saw ""Profumo di donna"" with Vittorio Gassman.Both fils are oinspired by a novel of Giovanni Arpino: two officers have lost the sight in an accident: they were used to give orders, they were socially important and now they depend on other persons: they show bitterness, aggressiveness and a tendency to depression and suicide.Both officers willmake a travel and will have as companion a young man (aa student in Scent of a woman and a young soldier in Profumo di donna.From there we have two different story, because the Italian film was made in 1974, the time of the Italian comedy (commedia all'italiana) : his director is the famous Dino Risi and the main actor actor is Vittorio Gassman.On the other side Martin Best is the director of Scent of a woman (1992) and the main actor is Al Pacino (we don't need to present him because he became famous for Scarface and the Godfather) and he won the academy Award for best Actor in 1992 (the other nominees were Robert Downey Jr,Clint Eatswood, Stephen Rea and Denzel Washington).

65,mattymatt4ever,One of Pacino's best!,8,13 May 2001,"Thank God!  Pacino FINALLY received the Oscar statue he so rightfully deserved in all the years he was in the acting business.  It's nice to know the Academy finally came to their senses, and awarded him a Best Actor Oscar for this landmark role.  This is one of his most memorable performances, and I'm sure when people think Pacino they think about his portrayal of the blind Colonel Slade.  Hoo ha!The movie itself is not, technically, great.  Very good, but not great.  The plot is quite predictable and driven via patented Hollywood devices.  The courtroom climax contains one of Pacino's most powerful monologues. However, its outcome is melodramatic.Personally, I thought the whole idea of Pacino being more perceptive of the world than any man or woman with perfect eyesight was far-fetched and sometimes more implausible than stunning.  I'm sure there are blind men in the world who ARE in fact very perceptive to what goes on in the world, but few--if any--who can recall a whole history triggered simply by the sound of one's voice.  How is he able to tell Chris O'Donnell has pimples?  He's not handicapped by blindness; this guy has psychic powers!  He doesn't need sight!  I do have to say that some of the most memorable lines come from this movie. Pacino says some original and wildly funny monologues involving subject matter I cannot discuss in this message.  And of course there's the timeless quote:  ""Hoo ha!""  Which later became a Pacino trademark.""Scent of a Woman"" is a somewhat flawed, but effective and entertaining film.  It's a must-see for Pacino fans everywhere!  It's not everyday you can catch a performance this powerful!My score:  8 (out of 10)",Scent of a Woman
66,hnt_dnl,GREAT film!,10,22 April 2011,"Don't care what anyone says, I form MY OWN opinions about movies. And SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992) is an outstanding piece of work. This is actually one of the few Oscar honored films from that decade that I find myself watching repeatedly. The legendary Al Pacino FINALLY took home the coveted Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant work in this film and he shouldn't have to apologize for it. Yes, he should have won for his work in THE GODFATHER and DOG DAY AFTERNOON, but too many actors to be named have been sadly overlooked for their best work. But if you don't think this is a great performance, then I don't know what film you're watching. Instead of worrying about who everyone else THINKS should have won, I say show some real objectivity and really watch the movie! Pacino perfectly essays the role of retired Colonel Frank Slade, who was compelled to retirement being blinded during duty. Stuck living with his niece and her family in their guest house and drawing monthly stipends from the government, Col. Slade is an embittered man of late middle age. Slade's niece has hired local boys' school student Charlie Simms (young Chris O'Donnell in a very underrated, genuine performance) to take care of Frank for the weekend during the Thanksgiving holidays. Slade opts to take Charlie with him on a weekend of luxury and reckless abandon in New York. Meanwhile, Charlie must wrestle with the moral dilemma of ""should he or shouldn't he"" squeal on his fellow classmates, who he along with another student saw commit a punishable act prior to the holidays. Charlie is to go before the disciplinary board upon his return.The thing that I love about the great Pacino is that his acting seems to raise other actors' games to another level. Contrary to all too popular opinion, Pacino in his later years is NOT an overactor! The character he is playing here calls for him being bombastic, ornary, and mean-spirited. This is who Frank Slade IS! And the fact that Mr. Pacino is truly a great actor makes him all the more believable. Not to mention that throughout the entire film, every time I watch it, not once do I feel like Pacino is PLAYING a blind man. I really think he is blind! Awesome performance.I think other actors just naturally react to Pacino's flawlessness and that is a huge reason this film still holds up because I actually like most of the minor roles in this movie. I wouldn't love it near as much if there were weak points, and, pardon the pun, ""frankly"", there are really none! The big lesson from SCENT OF A WOMAN is about the true meaning of honor. I like the dichotomy of Slade's situation with Charlie's and how Charlie, the student, inadvertently teaches Slade a valuable life lesson, that through the toughest of times and situations, it is the human SPIRIT that must remain intact if one is to truly LIVE! The supporting cast is golden, too....Gabrielle Anwar (charming as the beautiful young lady that Slade gets to tango with!), the always reliable James Rebhorn (pitch perfect as the stern headmaster of the boys' school), a young-looking Phillip Seymour Hoffman (terrific as Charlie's shifty ""best friend"" at the boy's school, who was his fellow witness), Richard Venture (as Frank's older brother W.R. Slade), a young Bradley Whitford (wonderful as Frank's resentful nephew Randy in my favorite scene of the film!), Ron Eldard (winning as the NY cop who stops Slade and Charlie for speeding), and a young and vibrant Frances Conroy (as an English teacher at Charlie's school who I always imagine that Frank ends up with!). Nominated for Best Picture, directed by Oscar nominated director Martin Brest (MIDNIGHT RUN, BEVERLY HILLS COP) and starring the one and only Al Pacino in his Oscar-winning role, SCENT OF A WOMAN is a film to enjoy over and over!",Scent of a Woman

69,tbills2,Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman! Whoo-ah!,8,8 June 2013,"Scent of a Woman is a character film study of the very finest. Al Pacino is the ideal man to play Lt. Col. Frank Slade. Pacino's perfect for Slade as Slade's perfect for Pacino. What would this movie have been with any other actor playing the part? Well, not as good, for starters. Al Pacino won his well-earned Oscar for this role. Pacino pours out passion as Col. Slade displaying a deep grief buried beneath his combustible fervor. Pacino exceptionally conveys moods, a master at conjuring emotion only with his presence, no spoken words being necessary. You feel Pacino's all-around performance in Scent of a Woman near as strong as any performance you can think of. Allow me to state that Chris O'Donnell is also perfect to play Charlie; I do believe it to be his only role where this statement is applicable. He stays back, sitting quiet letting Pacino lead, until he is needed and then O'Donnell is brilliant. Chris O'Donnell was impressive and he is a true star. Gabrielle Anwar was very well cast as well. Her role required a lesser known, fresh-faced actress and Anwar is beautiful for the part, she stars, and everybody should be familiar with her name. I love how Scent of a Woman's story is presented. Early on you're made aware that Charlie is to meet in front of the disciplinary committee at his boarding school on whether or not he witnessed his schoolmates pulling a prank on the headmaster who seeks to bribe Charlie with a trip to an Ivy League University for his testimony. But this won't come into play until the very last, thus, allowing us the entire movie to spend focusing on getting to know the blind Col. Slade in he and Charlie's growing relationship. Originally derived and excellently given story. Scent of a Woman messes about in painful drama the whole way through to the end when it then begins hitting heavily with compelling intrigue while during the fabulous courtroom scene. Slade gives a forever memorable, powerful speech on conduct and merit. Scent of a Woman is the lens into a beautiful life, the beautiful life of Lt. Col. Frank Slade. If every movie were as good as Scent of a Woman is, there wouldn't be so many damn bad movies.",Scent of a Woman

71,TheNorthernMonkee,Does anybody want to tango?,8,18 January 2004,"SPOILERSOK, how does someone comment on this film? I must admit I must have seen it way over a dozen times and I still love it. Truthfully though, without big Al Pacino, it'd be awful.In ""Scent Of A Woman"", Chris O'Donnell's Charlie Simms is placed in an awkward situation at school whilst simultaneously agreeing to spend Thanksgiving with an obnoxious bitter blind ex-soldier. The soldier, Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, is played with mouth dropping beauty by Al Pacino. I confess when British TV created their top 100 actors ever and Al Pacino was number one, I felt kinda cheated as for the films they suggested, I didn't feel it was anything special. If you watch the guy in this film though, it must go down as one of the finest performances of all time. At the 1993 Oscars, to give him the best acting award was fair, and truthfully, to not award it best film was equally right. I won't comment on Clint Eastwood gaining most of the awards for ""Unforgiven"", but irrelevant of what did win, I question if this film deserved the award. You ask me why? It's because it's a bit too variable.The one problem in my view with this film is that aside from Al Pacino, little else is really added to the show. Pacino is God like in his abilities, I cannot speak more highly of him, but the ultimate flaw is that you kinda feel the film runs out of direction and just filters off. I admit to not being an enormous fan of the end. This could possibly be though because probably the best cinematic scene of all time is featured earlier when Pacino tango's with Gabrielle Anwar. The scene is breathtakingly beautiful. Aided with stunning music and spot on execution, you finish that scene with the real physical need to be in that scene yourself. This scene is the films high point, and ultimately the problem. The reasoning is simply, that how do you improve on such a brilliant bit of film? The sad but true answer is that you don't. This film drops towards the end, not as much due to the creators fault, but due to natural inability to keep up a majestic pace.Ultimately, what can be said about ""Scent Of A Woman""? Well put it this way. One of my closest friends is ridiculously strict on his film tastes. His favourite films are ""American Beauty"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"". I don't know anybody who adores excellent cinematography and hates average cinematography as much as him. His view ten minutes after the Tango scene? He loved it. Take that as a hint. For the one key scene alone, this film must be watched.

74,Ben_Cheshire,A very moving piece.,8,27 November 2003,"The sentiment in ""Scent of a Woman"" does not feel false or forced - it is yearned for. This is the first movie in a long time where i've not found myself looking at how long there is left about half way through. I didn't want it to end, and now its over i have this lingering affection for it. I knew this would be a beautiful movie, no matter the outcome, when Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino) lets his newly hired assistant Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnel) know, as they sit at a lush meal, in an expensive restaurant, where they came from their hotel, the Walforf-Astoria, that while they are in New York, Slade plans to drive a ferrari, sleep with a beautiful woman, and lay down on his bed and blow his brains out.This is a movie about what there is to love in life - what reasons there are to live. And for Colonel Slade, above all things, that is making love to a woman - and a distant second, driving a ferrari.Feminists may find themselves uncomfortable when seeing this movie - because it indulges in a traditional stereotype of women, putting them up on a pedestal, so that they're so special they can not even be spoken to as a man can speak to a man. In many ways (contrary to what you might think) this is a man's picture. Its about the brotherhood between men, where the highest virtue is integrity; and its about man's love of women. In fact, women only pop up in this picture to serve the needs of the male characters, and the male scriptwriters. The most memorable of these cameos, of course, is Gabrielle Anwar, in the magestic (and famous) tango sequence. It surprised me that Anwar didn't return, until i realised that she was only there to dance with Slade, and what was important was the relationship between Slade and Simms.So although this movie is very much about men, and is very old-fashioned in its value system, it is these things in an affectionate way.

77,khatcher-2,Delicious high-class drama,8,26 July 2001,"I do not tend to go along with Hollywood-created cult figures, that kind of hero-worship, idol-making, whatever: you can have your Julia Roberts and such like making endless and mindless blockbuster hits with such insipid nonsense as `Pretty Woman', `Notting Hill' and so on, but it has to be something more serious like Joel Schumacher's `Dying Young' or even Steven Soderbergh's `Erin Brockovich' to convince me that Ms Roberts can/might be a good actress. The same goes for Al Pacino. Until the arrival of `Scent of a Woman' he was just merely another actor of those who come out of the Hollywood mass-manufacturing industry. `Scent of a Woman' changed all that: here Pacino shows he is a grand master, a brilliant actor.  It is not important that this film is a redoing of an Italian original, or even whether this film won him an Oscar: the film stands up for its own merits, and Pacino reaches colossal heights in this well-directed drama, ably and willingly aided by a refreshing Chris O'Donnell. Very much a two-man film as the characterisation centres masterfully on these two leading characters, Pacino had to carry out a truly theatre-like interpretation of a blind retired colonel; Bo Goldman's dialogues are up to the challenge, creating some magnificent monologues which Pacino so superbly enacted.My rating is somewhat higher than the surprisingly low IMDb user rating: a memorable and classic piece of serious cinema which puts Pacino into a very high category.",Scent of a Woman

He agrees to ""babysit"" a blind man by the name of Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, but the job is not all what he anticipated. This is an excellent film of 1992 that boosted Chris O' Donnell's career up for his performance of Charlie Simms. But the one actor who stole pretty much every scene in the movie, was that of Al Pacino as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, which later on granted him an Oscar for his role. The screenplay written by Bo Goldman and the direction by Martin Brest were very good and I don't think any other writer or director could've handled this film more carefully than these two. Overall, this a terrific film of 92 and an amazing performance from Pacino that made this one of my favorite films of the 90's. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+",Scent of a Woman
80,caa821,Pacino impressive as usual,9,28 October 2006,"Even the greatest and most prominent actors proceed ""over the top"" more often than seems appropriate at times. For example, despite the challenged nature of his character in ""Forrest Gump,"" I felt if Tom Hanks said in a whiny, nasal, drawn-out voice, ""My Jennnnny,"" one more time I'd scream. Ditto for Brando's mumbling in ""On the Waterfront"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" and Harrison Ford's droll, quiet, dour musings in the Clancy flicks and much of his other work. Hanks and Ford are great actors, Brando one of the great icons, with numerous fine, 8-figure performances among them. But all have been noticeably, and sometimes annoyingly, ""over-the top,"" often.On the other hand, Al Pacino is an actor who can be ""over-the-top,"" and it not only seems natural, but even necessary - and makes his character and performance come to life more effectively, making the film better than it would have been otherwise.""Scent of a Woman"" is a prime example. The part of the film with him driving the sports car speedily through Manhattan (albeit it on a weekend day with no competing traffic) is positively ludicrous, with no trace of real possibility - yet adds to the proceedings. (Certainly a blind person with a ""co-pilot"" could drive in some fashion, but never as depicted.)Pacino's mannerisms, speech and entire performance were on the one hand, overdrawn and exaggerated - but on the other, would have suffered with anything less.In real life, Pacino is not tall of stature, but like his predecessor, Alan Ladd, seems like he is 6-feet-tall or more on-screen, both physically and in the magnitude of his performances.",Scent of a Woman

So seeing Al Blind and he can tell if people are doing in front of him and such it is so true. I meet fully Blind men and women and bye smells and such they can make out a lot of things about people. Also in Sports Wrestling its crazy on how many times they WIN. That is with people that can see. My brother and his Blind Team use to WIN MOST OF THE TIME.

But it's a strong drama with a little bit of comedy thrown in. Al Pacino does a great performance as usual and he's the main (only?) reason to watch this.Overall I think the first half was better and it was building for something great but all the potential wasn't fully used. Seemed to me like the story was going somewhere but then decided not to go there. Something about the ending bothered me a bit.

85,roghache,Amazing bonding tale of blind retired officer and teenage companion,8,22 March 2006,"Apart from one objection (noted later), this is an incredible movie, memorable primarily for Al Pacino's brilliant portrayal of a rather nasty, blind retired army colonel, and for the developing relationship between said officer with a teenage boy hired as his temporary companion. Al Pacino is riveting, portraying with equal skill his character's bossy, sarcastic exterior and his hopeless, despairing interior. Not to mention...is Al Pacino blind himself? He plays the part so consistently, it's hard to believe that he's not.The plot revolves around a boarding school student named Charlie (Chris O'Donnell), who is hired (by the officer's niece) as a weekend companion to look after blind ex Colonel Frank Slade, while the niece's family go off on a Thanksgiving vacation. This doesn't turn out to be quite the easy, uneventful money making job the not very affluent young Charlie has anticipated, as he is caught up in Frank's plans for a whirlwind fast and fun trip to New York. And also, alas, in Frank's suicidal intent.The plot moves along quite sprightly, with the New York weekend involving limousines, a ritzy hotel, fancy dining, an assignation with a prostitute (for Frank), a wild Ferrari drive with a blind man at the wheel, and an incredible tango demonstration. Pacino deserved his Best Actor Oscar for that tango alone. Definitely one of the most immortal dance scenes in cinematic history. Enrollment in tango classes must have increased dramatically right after this movie's release. My only complaint is a sexual situation the movie might have done without (though the R rating gives ample warning), in the form of some remarks made by Frank at a relative's dinner table, though I suppose this did serve to dramatically highlight his crude nastiness. As for the hooker, it's made pretty clear that for Frank, this is merely second best sex, not the sort of relationship for which he truly longs but believes to be unattainable.Frank's world weariness is well conveyed, having lost his sight as the result of a stupid accident. The suicide attempt scene is gripping, especially as it highlights the relationship that has emerged in such a short period of time between the blind colonel and his young student companion. By the way, Chris O'Donnell is also excellent in his role here.As a tremendous fan of Dead Poets Society, I especially liked the whole boarding school plot line, which reminds me somewhat of that film. Charlie finds himself in trouble with school officials for not snitching on his rich, snobbish, despicable, cowardly, disloyal classmates. Personally, like many other reviewers, I see no reason why Charlie should not have tattled to start with on these creeps (in truth, no friends of his), but I guess the point is well taken that Charlie refuses to sell out his own ideals, whether we agree with them or not, for the sake of a scholarship.Fabulous movie, especially this unusual relationship between Frank and Charlie, that begins with Frank bellowing orders at his paid escort and ends with such a touching friendship, each party needing the other. And a wonderful ending with Frank going to bat for his young friend at the school's hearing, and putting those creepy classmates in their place with his dramatic speech. Also, a potentially interesting woman for him to pursue! But best of all, Frank's endearing and touching thaw in the closing scene toward the two children, his niece's kids, to whom he has previously acted so bearlike. Some have complained that the end ruined the movie, but sometimes it's nice to see such a moving and hopeful personal transformation. Drama need not necessarily end gloomily to be effective, and Scent of a Woman shows it.",Scent of a Woman

Would definitely recommend it to drama lovers.",Scent of a Woman
89,Okonh0wp,What chemistry,9,22 October 2005,"I saw Scent of a Woman last night on TV and I've watched this film once before about a decade ago. It's a typical ""young man meets older man and he guides him through a coming of age"" trial that's in the tradition of Dead Poet's Society, Goodbye Mr. Chips, and Good Will Hunting (although technically Good Will Hunting came after this). It stars Al Pacino as Colonel Slade, the old man who in this version has a pretty nasty exterior to get past, and Chris O'Donnell as the poor prep school student who must look after Pacino's character for a weekend so he can raise enough money to go home for Thanksgiving break.I started out having three main problems with this movie. First of all, Charlie (O'Donnell's character) is pretty asexual. Now, I think you're aloud to be asexual, and I don't think every protagonist in a movie has to be involved with a girl or something, but contrasted with so much talk about sex from the Colonel's character and the fact that Charlie who's in late adolescence when his hormones should be in full bloom, I found it rather curious. I wish he got to at least have danced with that pretty girl, rather than guided Al Pacino to dance with her in the tango scene. Nevertheless, it's still refreshing in the wake of some of the more oversexualized movies of the late 90s like American Pie and Cruel Intentions. My second problem lies in Al Pacino's character arc was from his impossible to get along with stage to his genuine self. I know it's necessary to create a certain progression for him, so he could've been so much more effective in his stubbornly likable personality, but still it was overdone and stretched out. My biggest beef, however, is that the boys who Charlie refuses to squeal on, have absolutely no likable traits whatsoever. They're ugly, uncharismatic, they rub it in how they're richer than him, and they're cowards. The pressure that one guy, George, exerts on him is cruel. It is true that the other headmaster is a jerk too, for picking on him, but I wasn't necessarily sure which was the lesser of two evils. However, these three things were what lingered in my memory about the movie from the last time I saw it 10 years ago, but by the movie's end, I was left exuberated and moved, because those problems are more than cancelled out by what the film has going for it, which is the immeasurable chemistry between Pacino and O'Donnell's characters in this film. O'Donnell plays his part with a wide-eyed innocence and a guarded sense of caution that has the added effect of keeping the movie from being too corny, and Pacino is mesmerizing. The two create magic with every conversation they have. Also, the movie plays out, like a series of short episodes, and some of them like the car driving scene and the tango lesson are a lot of fun. What I also came to appreciate is that the film is a little harder to grasp because it doesn't follow conventional methods of storytelling. True, it would be easier for Charlie's peers to be worth standing up to, but the story never took the easy route.",Scent of a Woman
90,nickmesafilms,Scent of a Woman (1992) - Whoo-Ah! Whoo-Ah!,9,8 May 2012,"Adapted from the Italian film version from Giovanni Arpino, ""Scent of a Woman"" tells the story of Chris O'Donnell as a preparatory student, who takes a weekend job, taking care of a blind, medically retired Army officer, portrayed brilliantly by Al Pacino, scoring his first ever Oscar win for Best Actor. Director Martin Brest and screenwriter Bo Goldman has perfectly made a visionary portrait of life, hope, friendship, and honesty. When I first started watching, I immediately realized that this movie was better than I thought it would be. I was drawn into the clever well-written dialogue from Bo Goldman, and the stand-out performances from the entire cast. But the shining cast member is Al Pacino, delivering one of the greatest performances of his career, that rightfully deserves his Best Actor Oscar. Although sadly, this is the only award he has won in his entire career, his award win will finally make others realize how excellent an actor Pacino is. But besides Pacino and O'Donnell, James Rebhorn, Gabrielle Anwar, and a young Philip Seymour Hoffman, round up the supporting cast with some clever, if necessary, performances. Delivered with some powerful sequences, provided with some beautiful directing, wonderful writing, and insanely wonderful music, ""Scent of a Woman"" is one of the many masterpieces of Al Pacino's career. Although the 157-minute run time seemed to drag a bit, with some scenes that needed to be in the movie or not, that were just sort of stuck, that didn't ruin the movie's true potential, luckily. Since 1992 was considered the year of the woman, ""Scent of a Woman"" might not have been a movie that was all about women, but it does share a wonderful and beautifully made tale, through the case of an insanely enjoyable motion picture.

Colorless collegiate Chris O'Donnell gets stuck babysitting volatile,loud-mouthed blind veteran Al Pacino on a trip to NYC. This minimal storyline is unbearably expanded into a meandering, pointless 3-hour dirge of epic proportions. There is a frightfully uninteresting subplot, which provides the film's coda concerning whether O'Donnell should rat out the privileged obnoxious students responsible for vandalizing a snooty professor's car, but given that the students are worthless, the professor boorish and O'Donnell so vacant, it is hard to develop much interest. Instead, the wonder lies in watching Al Pacino (in his worst and only Oscar-winning performance) scream, sputter, gesticulate, cuss, yell ""Hooha"" after every other line, chew huge chunks out of the NYC scenery and basically provide an atrocious performance that contains no traces of subtlety or introspection for the entire running time. The actor responsible in giving us some of the best acting of the 70s in The Godfather films, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico, etc., gets rewarded for his most execrable work? That's Hollywood for you! As the only other cast member of note, O'Donnell lowers his eyes to floor, mumbles his lines and basically allows Pacino to trod all over him. By the climax, when Pacino takes to the stage at O'Donnell's Ivy League School to defend his honor (over a ludicrous issue) and starts cussing and threatening to burn the place down with a flame-thrower, you know the film is utterly worthless because in reality security would have immediately escorted him to a padded cell somewhere.

I have the tape and have watched it a bazillion times. I have seen many other actors playing a blind man but Pacino outwits them all. I have watched it closely just to watch his eyes. He is terrific!  Every time we watch the movie we spend at least two days going: ""Oo-rah!"" I like prep school movies and I have two movies where Chris O'Donnell (Circle of Friends) Charlie Simms is in a prep school. I guess it goes with his type. I like the part of  Charlie who is doing the best he can with the weekend he has to face. One of the most difficult things for people is to feel is useless. That is how Lt. Co. Frank Slade feels. He also has a cynicism about life that in a sense is funny because of its irony.  He meets Charlie and has everything planned out.  The Colonel has extremely good taste.  Meeting young Charlie, who is in a very difficult situation, the outspoken Lt. Col. found a reason to live and to feel useful again, even enjoying the smell of the perfume of Charlie's teacher.  I did not see the 1974 Italian film ""PROFUMO DI DONNA,"" but would love to see the performance of the late Vittorio Gassman, one of the most well known actor of the Italian Theater and Cinema.

There is a lot of bytes of internet space consumed criticising this movie for its Best Actor Oscar, and I can see some justification for it. But I decided it was vital to watch it with an open mind.Scent of a Woman is a great deal of fun to watch, with fine performances, a witty screenplay and a fun atmosphere permeating the whole thing. As weekend/roadtrip movies go, its right up there. The premise is established from the get-go - Frank Slade is going to have one last good weekend before he commits suicide, and its down to the out-of-his-depth Charles Simms to help him with that battle. Its pretty predictable, but still a heap of fun.It is very difficult to gage Al Pacino in this movie. The first impression that he gives is of an overacted caricature, who behaves like no real person ever would. That will leave a sour taste in your mouth instantly. He shouts every other line and snaps the rest. However, just like the character grows on Charlie, Pacino's performance grows on the viewer. He is effortlessly charming and charismatic and yet completely obnoxious and difficult. He's a burden or a blessing on everyone around him, depending on what he wants. And Pacino is supremely convincing as a blind man - in the scene where he drives the Ferrari, I was almost paralysed in fear. In the end, Pacino has done better work, but I have decided that to call this the least deserving Best Actor of all time is a dramatic overstatement.The rest of the cast slots around Pacino best they can, and a fair few of them get some good moments. O'Donnell is not a bad actor, but he's out of his depth with Pacino, and that suits the film's atmosphere perfectly. Two late acting talents also shine in their smaller roles - James Rebhorn as the uptight and pompous Principal, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's George Willis Jr gives a superb indicator of the magnificent career to come. The screenplay is great fun, full of wit, insults and memorable moments. The tango scene between Donna and Slade is going down as one of my favourites. There are a few sickly sweet and predictable clichés tucked here and there, but we forgive them through satisfaction with the finished product. The pacing is good for the most part - although I feel 20 minutes could have easily been trimmed from the third act. Ultimately, I feel the worst thing that could ever have happened to Scent of a Woman is that it was the film that finally won Pacino his Oscar.

The plot of the film itself was interesting and engaging, but ""great"" is not a word I'd use to describe this movie.  In fact, I'd barely even use the word ""good.""  Decent entertainment with likeable characters is more like it, but the film ultimately has nothing new to say that hasn't been said a thousand times already (unless the ""deep message"" here is ""great men and leaders don't snitch on their friends"").  5/10, and if you see anything 'deep' in it then you just need to get out more.",Scent of a Woman

102,MrPupkin,"Pacino's performance is that rare kind that captivates all on its own, stealing every scene away from everyone else in it.",10,29 May 2021,"Scent Of A Woman is one of them films that really blows you away if you're not expecting it. Like The Place Beyond The Pines, I got so much more than I was expecting. Al Pacino has never had a better role since Godfather 1 & 2. He just BLOWS YOU AWAY, he is on top form. It's funny this is Chris O'Donnells best performance to date and yet it was one of his first! The running time is 150mins which scared me but I was gripped the whole time. I had to stop half an hour in due to the time but I just wanted to carry on so much. The story is amazing and even carries a moral message. It follows a young college student who goes to earn money by looking after a knowledgable blind war veteran while dealing with a big problem at school. It's captivating from start to finish. As I said early, and I cannot stress this enough, Al Pacino has hardly ever been better, he is breathtaking in every scene he is in. The whole mentor, student relationship is interesting throughout & Chris wasn't even a hinderance. There are so many amazing scenes in this movie. It is a classic for sure. It is the only film Al Pacino has ever won an oscar for, and you definitely see why. He is one of the greatest American actors who has ever lived. Overall, Al Pacino brings out an AMAZING performance, the supporting cast are excellent, the story and it's progression are amazing, a great score and a definite classic.",Scent of a Woman
103,PetarNeo,Whoo-ah hah,9,28 September 2016,"After two decades of acting and providing us with magnificent performances Pacino did one hell of a job it this one and you just can't forget anything about movie. It's tale of student that needs money and blind veteran that seems to be arrogant and bold but actually is just dealing with life in different kind cause of everything that has experienced. You can feel his anger and disappointment with a lot of things, so he tends to push student to the limits with his behavior and also to show him how to be impressive even if you can't see. Pacino character brings the new light and view to a lot of things and you can't help but to feel empathy in some moments as he does some of very great things and changes his mind about killing himself. There are some times when you feel like movie ends but it still keeps going with plot. 3.5/4",Scent of a Woman

Scent of a Woman sounded kinda boring, but it wasn't. It's a great movie. Though without Al Pacino it would be much worse, but still I liked the plot and characters of this movie, so there was no boring moments, even when Al Pacino wasn't on the screen. It quickly became my favorite Al Pacino's performance, it's even better that his performance at Scarface. He as always was very energetic in this film.

106,mr_popcorn,Hoo-ah,8,16 November 2008,"Scent of a Woman tackles life important issues like values, principles and integrity and is done in such a way that it brings power and sensitivity at the same time. Director Martin Brest didn't rely on ""tried and tested"" Hollywood tearjerker formula but instead takes it deep from the heart and just overwhelms you with great emotions. If this film haven't touched you at the very least, then I don't know what will. What tops off this mesmerizing film is the intensity that the actors brought to the table most especially Al Pacino in one of his career defining roles as Lt. Col. Frank Slade.In what is possibly one of the finest showcase of acting I have ever seen, Al Pacino disappears completely and minute by minute a new sentient being emerges, that of a blind man whose sarcastic wit and rip roaring voice demands attention and believe you me, you cannot help but get carried away by Pacino's superb performance. One shining moment is most definitely the speech that his character gave at the end. It is undoubtedly one of the finest monologues I have ever seen in the history of cinema. Great delivery by Pacino. Nothing more can be said, it is powerful, deep, grand, heart-wrenching and majestic. It is a testament as to why Al Pacino can almost be compared to a god, a living, breathing god. Chris O' Donnell, not to say he underperformed but he delivers as well playing school boy Charlie Simms. One might say he was completely overshadowed by an acting god which is not entirely true. He had some defining moments throughout the film and is overall fantastic.Scent of a Woman is a must-see.",Scent of a Woman
107,johnny-08,Pacino makes a difference,9,26 October 2007,"Every few weeks on TV in Croatia you can watch four movies with same actors in it. This week on TV were Al Pacino's movies: ""S1m0ne"", ""The Merchant of Venice"", ""Cruising"" and finally ""Scent of a Woman"". Of those four movies ""Scent of a Woman"" probably isn't the best choice but for Pacino fans answer is definitely positive. And not only for his fans. I just don't understand those people who cannot recognize great acting when they see it. Can you imagine how hard it must be to act a blind man? His performance as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade is so powerful that this is one my favorite performances I have ever seen (along with Brando, Nicholson, Dean and Depp). Pacino simply blown me off. My favorite scene is in a hotel room when he's trying to kill himself and when he says: ""I'm in a dark here."" For a while I didn't breathe at all, that effect Pacino left on me. I'm his big fan and the Academy gave him Oscar for this role but I dare to say that he should have won the golden statue long before that (""Godfather"", ""Serpico"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Scarface"" ...). But good things comes to those who wait. I don't even won't to talk about the movie, only about Pacino. I'll only say that I didn't like the last scene when everybody applause him in the school (so American happy ending). Also lots of people aren't familiar with the fact that this is remake of Dino Risi's ""Profumo di donna"" which is excellent film. And also I will explain my grade of the whole movie. 8 for the movie, 10 for the Pacino = 9/10.",Scent of a Woman
108,MF210,A very enjoyable film that only drags at the end,8,15 February 2004,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Scent of a Woman was a very successful film when it came out. It was called a ""crowd pleaser"" and it earned four Oscar Nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay). It took home Best Actor for none other than the masterful Al Pacino. If there is any reason Scent of a Woman will be come a classic it is because it was the only time Pacino won an oscar. That is not to say there is not anything good about the film but Pacino is the commanding force.For the most part, Scent of a Woman is an enjoyable film and even though it is long it will not feel like it. A lot of things are done right in the film. The chemistry between the two main actors is excellent and the pacing is just right. The first time I saw Pacino's performance I was not impressed. I thought he was way over the top. This time I fully appreciated the performance. It was magnificent. Frank Slade is not exactly a subtle character, so Pacino's performance is a bit over the top but that is because it calls for it. Pacino makes Frank Slade into an extremely memorable character. I do not know if I would call this the best performance of his career but it is certainly Oscar Worthy. Chris O'Donnell is excellent a Charlie. He is not as commanding as Pacino but that is because Charlie is a less showy character. O'Donnell's approach is understated but his performance is memorable. The chemistry between him and Pacino is excellent.Unfortunately, the ending for Scent of a Woman is weak. It is over the top and it seems to go on forever. It seems to be for those people who just want a happy ending all the time. However, Scent of a Woman has enough strong points to make it worth seeing.",Scent of a Woman

110,Semisonic,Masculinity lessons from a violent drunkard,5,21 March 2016,"It's curious how deceiving movie titles can be. My sister once told me that she refused to watch Scent of a Woman when her boyfriend suggested it because she expected that movie to be a type of cinema that people jerk off to. Well, can't say i blame her, because the title does seem intriguing and suggesting a deep erotic undertone.But, as it's often the case with sensationalized material, the risqué name is given to something quite irrelevant. And instead of a racy romance Scent of a Woman tells us a story of a blind ex-military man and a prep school student hired for a few days to look after him. But, despite his handicap, the retired colonel still has a lot of vigor within, and what seemed like an easy job for a poor kid turns into a series of life lessons and dramatic revelations.One good thing about this film is Al Pacino's acting. He's more or less the same as usual, always trying to steal every scene he's in, but it's nevertheless entertaining to watch him portray a blind man whose taste for life refuses to be diminished and restricted by his incapabilities.But the problems arise when it turns out that Al Pacino is the only good thing this film has to offer. As his character's guide and partner we are given Charlie Simms, a 17 year old Baird student, a poor kid from Oregon who's struggling to establish his status among the much more privileged peers. Charlie is supposed to be a smart guy, a national scholarship winner, but instead we see a mumbling wide-eyed dumbo with literally no self-respect or brains to behave reasonably in his predicament. The movie tries to show his voyage to New York City with Colonel Slade as some sort of a rite of initiation, a compensation for a lack of a strong male role model in his life. However, it's hard to see Charlie as a man in the making, because, despite being yelled at, tossed around and ridiculed, he fails to make a single defining stand or at least demand to be reckoned with. Instead, he's hardly more than an obedient marionette in Colonel Slade's hands. And when placed against someone so submissive and meek (and weak and bleak), Al Pacino's character, despite all his attempts to be charming and charismatic, looks more like a grumpy old alcoholic, albeit dressed like a dandy, with attitude issues and an ego way beyond his merit.The whole film revolves around a moral dilemma Charlie is forced to face, and, in an inevitable happy ending, Colonel praises the kid for a certain integrity of character, warming up to him and, by some twist of fate, to everyone else who surrounds him. The problem is that despite the movie trying to pass Charlie's position for an integrity tested and hardened by the severe trials resulted from that unlikely bond of two people, the truth is that Charlie is no more self-aware at the end than he was at the beginning, and the only integrity he has is the one that other people want to see in him. A virtue not earned but granted from above. And just as Charlie receives an overwhelming praise for basically doing nothing, this film is more of an exercise in self-admiration than a showcase of the genuinely good things we could appreciate it for.",Scent of a Woman

112,sandnair87,"Thanks to Al Pacino's Bravura Performance, This One Bears The Sweet 'Scent' of Success!",9,20 December 2015,"In order to make an extra buck, prep-school teen Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) takes a job caring for Colonel Frank Slade, an embittered blind war veteran, over Thanksgiving holiday. Charlie wants to back out of the job as soon as he meets the cantankerous man, but he's too nice to say no to the colonel's harried niece who obviously needs a vacation. A tough, aging ex-military man, the colonel no longer has control of his life due to blindness. Charlie has his own problems - for one, he's a small-town teen attending a fancy prep school on scholarship. He's also witnessed his bratty ""friends"" committing a crime, and after the holidays he'll be forced to rat on them or be expelled. Charlie thinks the weekend will be spent in the colonel's grim little cottage, watching the old guy drink and listening to his insults. The colonel however, has other ideas - more than Charlie can even begin to guess. Charlie's life-changing adventure begins when the irritable, outspoken, whiskey-guzzling colonel drags him to New York City for a weekend of indulgences, before ""blowing his brains out"". As the weekend wears on, Charlie grows to care about Frank, discovering the sensitive man behind the gruff exterior as the two slowly come to understand each other.Director/Producer Martin Brest knows how to blend humor with drama to good effect. His mix is nearly flawless, and he manages to do almost (and I emphasize almost) the entire film without resorting to manipulative tricks. Bo Goldman's screenplay is witty but far from perfect. The script loses its edge near the end, when the film loses its sharp-tongued humor and becomes maudlin and slightly melodramatic. But what salvages the screenplay is the vastly interesting and original character of Frank – a character so flawed that he is never boring. And a large part of the credit for that goes to Al Pacino! For two hours, he brings Frank Slade to life in a way that few others can. As portrayed by Pacino, there's far more to this man than a rancorous outlook on life and a couple of hearty ""hoo-ha""s. His convincing work here is another testament to his incredible talent and versatility. Chris O'Donnell is solid, if somewhat obscured in the more experienced man's shadow. Although the role of Charlie is understated by O'Donnell, he nevertheless manages to fashion a rapport with the audience.A funny, impassioned, and all-around enjoyable film, Scent of a Woman bears the sweet scent of success!",Scent of a Woman

114,quinimdb,Scent of a Woman,8,13 July 2016,"Our first introduction to Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade is behind a thick wall of smoke, sitting next to a bottle of Jack Daniels. He yells at Charlie Simms a lot, the kid who will be taking care of him in order to earn money to spend for his trip to his family during Christmas. He also seems to be stuck in the past, in the days when he was in the army. Oh, and he's blind. Charlie is instantly scared, and is in a lot of trouble in school. He goes to a (fictional) prep school for college, and was seen near the people that were setting up a prank as they were setting it up. However, only him and George Willis Jr were there to see exactly who it was that did it, but George is in the group of people that set up the prank. These kids are spoiled and ridicule Charlie for being poor, as well as ridiculing the headmaster for thinking he is above them thanks to a Jaguar car that he was recently gifted, while also pretty much thinking they are above everyone else. Despite Charlie thinking he is only going to stay a day with the Colonel, once they go to New York (unexpectedly) and he doesn't make it in time for his train. He soon learns Colonel Frank is planning on spending all of his money on a night with his family, a nice night and a nice woman (one of the two things he says he loves, the second being Ferraris). The fact that Colonel has lost his sense of sight and the thing he loves most is women shows how much he has lost, since the only thing he has to go on is their voice, and, well... their scent. Frank learns that George is in trouble and his advice is to ""take cover"" rather than to face the consequences, as that is what Frank has always done. George doesn't even like these guys, but something is telling him not to do it.George naturally grows closer to the Colonel, especially after one revealing (and incredibly tense) dinner with his family that shows that not even his family loves him. And it ends with the Colonel choking his niece for several seconds for calling Charlie ""Chuck"". The most important part of this scene however is when he admits he is a bad person at the end of the scene, showing that he is aware of his flaws. The next day Charlie and Frank go to eat, and end up meeting a girl in a bad relationship who Frank ends up dancing with and Frank is reminded of why he is still living. He is reminded of the pleasures of life, and how the tango, unlike life, ""doesn't get tangled for good, you just keep on tangoing"". That night George takes the bullets away from Frank to make sure that he won't kill himself. Frank even gives him the last one. The next day, however, Frank doesn't look well. Then George finally gets Frank to drive a Ferrari and it is both terrifying and somewhat funny. He goes way faster than he should and almost crashes a multitude of times, but afterwards, the thrill is gone. Frank goes back to the hotel room, asks George to go get him cigars and liquor and suits up to kill himself. When George gets back however he simply won't let him do it, and from here, Frank points the gun at him. He can't stand to see him sell out to his principles life and go on living a boring and unfulfilled life, because George has too much integrity for that and that's rare. But George still won't give up. As Frank says, he's always stood up to people because it makes him feel important. George stands up to them simply because he has integrity. So that's what George does to him. He reminds him of the great moments of life, like the Ferrari and the tango, and how his life could be those moments. Eventually Frank decides not to do it (but very nearly does) and the scene is both heart-rending and incredibly tense, and Pacinos performance in this scene, no, this movie (specifically this scene, the final scene, and the dinner scene) rival that of the greatest of all time and I mean that. The next courtroom scene show Frank's change in character as well as George's decision to take the right path in life. George doesn't even like the people that he is not snitching on, yet he will not sell out their lives to make his own better, and THAT is integrity. Frank knows many of the men who died in battle who were with him are better men than him, he knows facing the consequences of leading a good life are hard, which is why he has always chosen the easy way out. But being with George has made him realize, as proved by the final scene when Frank is playing with the children he was yelling at in the beginning, that life is only as good as you make it. If you try to have integrity and spread happiness and well being to those around you, even in the toughest situations, you will be happy in the long run. And even though that courtroom scene where Frank delivers his great monologue, and everyone starts clapping sounds a little cheesy, I feel it is earned by the film, because the journey that the characters had been on led them to that defining moment, and the message that comes with it is an important one.",Scent of a Woman
115,kergillian,Might have been half decent if it wasn't so LOOOOOONG!!,5,23 March 2001,"I can count on both hands how many films clock in past 2h30 and actually succeed. And believe me this is no Godfather. How Al Pacino could have won an Oscar for this film and missed out on the two Godfather films still has me puzzled. This film has a few clever scenes, particularly the tango scene in the restaurant, but they're surrounded by terribly long, dreary scenes that seem to neither go nowhere nor have anything to do in terms of plot value. And that's the main problem with this film; there's very little in the way of plot value. You could cut an hour from this film and trim some of the repetitive Pacino monologues and you'd have a decent film. But some scenes, which could be good, just drag on far too much. The driving scene, for example. Cut half of the driving scene off and you have a strong scene. As it is, it's just plain boring. Same goes for the great final monologue, cut the intro to shreds and ease up on the speech, and it would be a very powerful scene. As well, Chris O'Donnell simply can't act. I've yet to see a film he's in where I was impressed with his acting. I can think of half a dozen actors who could've done two hundred percent better...like Ethan Hawke or Ed Norton...or even River Phoenix (bless him!). There were a few bright spots, one being Gabrielle Anwar. A very small role, but she was charming and had a wonderful presence. Her charisma played beautifully off of Pacino's forward character. As well, Phillip Seymour Hoffman had a too small role, but he played it perfectly, especially in the awkward final scene. Wasn't up to his fabulous role in Boogie Nights, or his stand-out performance in State and Main, but it was strength where there was little else. Overall: wasted talent and a waste of film. The strong potential is ruined by the yawn-filled monotony. If it was 1h45 I'd probably rate it a seven or eight, but as it stands: 5/10.",Scent of a Woman

Chris O'Donnell's acting style seems to be ""I'm going to try and be as white bread and annoying as possible."" Al Pacino is what makes this movie fun and funny to watch. Pacino's Lt.Col. Frank Slade (Ret), is one of the most colorful characters that he has ever played and has a lot of fun with Frank's biting dialogue. The end scene is quite a fire breather.

So... I really was moved by Al Pacino's acting performance. The story and the setting is relatively straightforward, so the movie gains mostly through the performances. Pacino really digs into his character and the way he portrays the lost, blind, experienced man with his strengths and weaknesses gets to your heart.
In my opinion, a great actor is someone who makes you forget his real name, even IF he is a star in his league. And that is what Al Pacino did: he went so deep into the role that maybe even he forgot who he was behind the scenes?Enjoyed it: very deep and emotional film about strength, survival, honor, joy - and what makes life worth living.",Scent of a Woman

His acting is grand, superb, majestic, heart-wrenching, deep, emotional, so forth. His portrayal of a blind man dangling in the rope of his life, is not only credible but immensely touching.

119,lucasversantvoort,Where Pacino finally got his Oscar,7,6 May 2015,"Scent of a Woman, a film mostly remembered for two things: ""Hoo-Ah"" and where Pacino finally got his Oscar. The film itself is quite well-made however. Two lost souls, both with difficulties communicating with the people around them, finding and helping each other sounds like the foundation for a wonderful movie if done right. This film does it mostly right.Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) is a prep school student. He witnesses a prank on his school's headmaster. He knows his friends did it and the headmaster asks Charlie to divulge the names of those responsible. If he does, he'll get a free ticket into Harvard. Sounds like a dilemma that will be solved by the film's end. To pay for a trip to spend Christmas time with his parents, he agrees to look after Frank, a blind, retired Lt. Colonel. Once Frank's family leaves, Frank reveals his plane is to go to New York. Charlie panics, but doesn't see any option but to go with the stubborn Frank. Once there and they check into the Waldorf-Astoria, Frank reveals his plan: to bask in certain luxurious pleasures before committing suicide. Needless to say, the emerging relationship between Charlie and Frank will be life-changing for both of them.And therein lies the true appeal of this film. Yes, it's formulaic and predictable, but when done right, these stories can still warm the heart. And this film does it mostly right. It combines drama and humor in a balanced way that easily enables us to sympathize with these characters: Charlie with his desire to get into Harvard and fear of being called a snitch, Frank with his regrets in life regarding his family, etc. The great acting by Pacino and O'Donnell also helps a great deal in lending the (sometimes sappy) drama an air of credibility. Despite the parodies that've surfaced online, make no mistake: this is a pretty good film.There are two things that hold it back however: the length and the ending. At 2,5 hours, this film is just way too long. The drama is too 'thin' to support such a timespan and the film suffers for it. The ending is also a tad cringe-worthy. It features a 'trial' at Charlie's school where he's compelled to give up the identities of the pranksters (his friends). Frank, of course, makes an unexpected appearance and has a big speech in which he defends Charlie and accuses the system and Charlie's friends. The disciplinary committee has seen the light and excuse Charlie. The students present rejoice and all's well that ends well. As if that's not enough, there's also a suggestion of a future romance between Frank and one of the teachers. If all this feels way too sappy, then you are a master of understatement. While there's a lot of truth in Frank's Big Speech, the lack of subtlety undermines the quality of the rest of the film. If this and the overall length were altered, Scent of a Woman would've been a truly great achievement.",Scent of a Woman
120,teh_mode,"Al Pacino rocks, Chris O'Donnell flounders and I really enjoyed myself.",7,24 February 2006,"Scent Of Woman starts with us meeting Charlie Simms, a young Baird School attendee, who seeks the affection of his fellow classmates, despite their indifference towards him. He soon finds himself in contact with blind, former army Colonal Frank Slade, heavy drinking and constantly goading his young friend. Charlie has accepted a job to aid Frank as his assistant. Little did he know that this would involve travelling with him to New York on a $24 hamburger-munching, tango-dancing, Ferrari-flashing glamour-fest. Slade also takes him to meet his brother, and then wishes he hadn't. Is Slade a really a basket case, who prays on others to sooth his own pain? Or is he really as proud as he proclaims? The truth is he's both.The film's plot is fairly irrelevant, as the screenplay is almost entirely engaged with it's two leads. At almost three hours long this was obviously a big risk, but the reason it works is because Al Pacino is on absolutely barnstorming form. It's obviously not his best performances. The chances to covet those roles have unfortunately well and truly past. But Colonal Slade is the epitome of his screen persona. He is ferocious, candor and flamboyant. But it is easy to underestimated Pacino. He may be a tower of fire in most of his movies but to dismiss him as a showy character actor is to undermine the breathtaking subtlety (and believe me, he IS a subtle actor) that he adds to his roles. The problem with the film is his young understudy, played by Chris O'Donnell, is about as engaging as a wet towel. The similarly themed ""Rain Man"" had a wonderfully vivid performance from Dustin Hoffman which was matched by an underplayed turn from Tom Cruise. Chris O'Donell is always unsure of himself. He never reacts the way he's supposed to and constantly looks bored. So the film has the paradoxical effect of benefiting from Al Pacino's scenery chewing.Aside from Pacino, the other thing I loved about this film was it's score. Thomas Newman, who went on to do similar music for American Beauty and Six Feet Under adds real feeling to some of the film's most tender scenes. Whilst Pacino adds true insight into the anguish and loneliness of Colonal Slade, we get this wonderfully quiet and moody chorus that plays whilst Slade bears the truth of his soul to young Charlie Simms. Slade puts on a forthright front of snide sarcasm that cuts in between romantic charm. At his most bare, he is a bitter, self-loathing masochist, who wants to end his life in a blaze of dollar-dispensing glory, with the aid of young Simms. And I think the score is used very neatly wit those scenes.There are other films that deal with these similar themes. The story about two opposites meeting and having a love/hate relationship intertwined with a coming-of-age story about pubescent young boy standing up for what he believes in is certainly touching and affecting, but I don't think it is quite as good as it could have been, largely because of the weakness of casting Chris O'Donnell. At 152 minutes it's a pretty long ride. But aside from this it is very entertaining, and certainly shows what Martin Brest was capable of before he went off and made riffraff like Meet Joe Black (1998) and the infamous Gigli (2003). A treat.",Scent of a Woman

I could watch it every day and never get tired of it.One thing that is incredibly impressive about this movie is how well it ages. Not many movies are like that, most will really start showing their age within a few years from their original release date, especially now that every movie seems to make references to current pop culture trends that won't stand the test of time and lines referring to such trends won't be understood by future audiences because of their topical nature.Al Pacino gives a powerhouse performance as Lt.

123,kylehodgdon,Very Good With A Unique Character,8,18 December 2009,"I really did not know what to think coming into this film. The title, ""Scent of a Woman"", certainly does not really give the viewer much idea of what this film is all about. The audience immediately feels for Charlie who honestly does the best he can to do what is right, but luck does not usually shine in his direction. So he meets up with Frank who certainly does not give him any leniency from the get-go. After a while, Frank becomes a father figure to Charlie and the two learn from, and help each other out.The plot does not sound extremely original, that is until you factor in the fact that Frank is blind and ready to give up on life. Al Pacino really makes this film with his over-the-top portrayal of the colonel. He is a very interesting character and it is neat to see him interact with different people.One little problem I had with the movie was the courtroom scene. I know in some private schools they have these mock courtroom situations to deal with disciplinary actions, but this one seemed a bit too far fetched.This is a great movie to work and has the unique variable of someone who cannot see to make it stand out more than others.",Scent of a Woman

Like Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", give 'em a disability to work with..and they start printing your name on the gold guy.
Don't get me wrong. This is a quality flick with quality performances. But it's not ""Godfather II"". So 20 years later, your friends at AMPAS decided to reward a career. No problem. However, I suggest that you go back and take a look at ""Scarecrow"" to do some comparison shopping on Pacino's approach to a character with heavy duty inner turmoil.Chris O'Donnell gets to reap the benefits of working alongside the master.

That is the most beautiful scene I ever watched. I have to remind you if you have not watched it, Al was blind. I was deeply touched by the scene. Every time I remind of the scene, I feel that I am so lucky to live in the world (though the present world is not so good).As to the performance, Al is perfect. He absolutely deserved the Oscar award. You cannot imagine he brought us so many unforgettable roles. Just take a few examples here. A cold blood mafia in Godfather, a fearless cop in Heat, a righteous reporter in The insider. Frankly speaking, if I was the Oscar judge, I will award him more little gold men.I always think that what we can get from a movie is not just entertainment.

I'm not going to say ""Scent of a woman"" is one of Pacino's best movies because he just has made too many great movies (The Godfather Trilogy, Dog Day Afternoon,...), but he certainly is brilliant! Pacino deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role but it's a shame he had to wait such a long time to win his first Academy Award, it shouldn't be his only! I think he should definitely had won for Supporting Role for ""The Godfather"" and Leading Role for ""Dog Day Afternoon"".I have seen ""Scent of a woman"" several times and I just can't say something bad about this movie. The story, based on the novel of the Italian writer Giovanni Arpino is excellent. You really see Frank Slade changing during the movie. If you compare the Frank Slade at the beginning of the movie with the one who gets out of the limo at the very end, you'll see he is a completely different person. In the beginning, Slade had planned the trip to New York as the last highlight of his miserable life. That's why he wanted to commit suicide in his hotel room.Because he was blind, he didn't felt alive anymore. He said it too: ""The day we stop looking, is the day we die"". Frank Slade had died a long time ago, inside he was already dead for a long time. But in New York, with Chris O'Donnel in his neighbourhood, he started feeling alive again. The ride with the Ferrari, the visit to the prostitute and of course...the wonderful tango with Gabrielle Anwar who gives a touching performance. All this makes Frank Slade start feeling alive again. Although he isn't able to see, he has noticed some light at the end of his blind tunnel.Touching story, amazing acting... All of this makes ""Scent of a woman"" a must see for everyone. Also the scene where the speech is given by Pacino at O'Donnel's school is breathtaking. Al Pacino gives the performance of he lifetime. I love De Niro but Pacino is definitely the best actor of his generation. **** out of ****",Scent of a Woman
129,margulanabutrlov,The Scent of a Woman Review,10,23 March 2019,"In order to make some money for a Christmas trip home, impoverished college-student Charlie agrees to look after Frank, a blind retired Colonel for Thanksgiving. Babysitting takes on a whole new dimension when Frank decides he wants to spent the weekend living it up in New York City.
As Lt. Col. Frank Slade, a lonely bitter soldier blinded - literally - by his own obnoxious foolishness, Al Pacino roars his way through a role that might have been generated by a Going For Oscar computer programme. He is loud, crusty but lovable, wisecracking, physically-challenged and, in a denouement that crosses Dead Poets Society with courtroom drama, even affects a sudden, inexplicably Southern accent.
Indeed, Pacino rampant is just about the whole show in this contrived, overlong, deceptively titled generation gap buddy picture. Sweet, sincere Chris O'Donnell is Charlie, a poor scholarship boy at a snooty New England prep school who nervously accepts the job of babysitting irascible, acid Col. Frank for the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend. As soon as the relations are out of the way, young Charlie finds himself Frank's captive sidekick, shanghaied for a wild fling in New York City, where Frank indulges his tastes for Jack Daniels, fragrant women, tango dancing and gallows humour. He even has a catchword - ""Hoo-wah!"" - to indicate pleasure, amazement or danger at regular intervals.
Bo Goldman's script is primarily notable for the relentless stream of poisonous, filthy, funny quips given to Pacino, most of them directed at O'Donnell's nicely ingenuous straight man foil. Yet it doesn't take a genius to realise that when Charlie's employer innocently suggests ""By Sunday night you'll be best friends,"" so they will.
With its echoes of Rain Man and Poets (in the unnecessarily protracted schoolboys-and-honour guff), this is little more than an entertaining show-off routine for Pacino, with little apparent intervention from the director. And it is one he does with such knowing relish that when he concludes a heartstring-tugging monologue with the aside ""Was that cornball enough?"" one has to applaud in enthusiastic agreement.",Scent of a Woman

131,CinefanR,Al Pacino's Slade is heart-wrenchingly real. Amazing,10,9 May 2012,"Al Pacino's eyes and voice- there's nothing better than that in cinema. At least that's my impression after finally having seen Scent of a Woman"". Al Pacino's Slade is heartbreaking, there's no embarrassment in saying it. There is a tremendous amount of sadness in his eyes, it's the sheer desperation of a passionate man trapped inside by his disability. He delivers his speeches with such incredible strength, heart-wrenching vulnerability and irresistible charm... And the whole thing will never descend into cheap melodrama. Pacino's eyes, as I was saying, make the entire movie, and it's amazing how he can display such subtle nuances despite not focusing on anything. Slade is a tragic figure and one of the most complex, memorable personalities ever created in film.Chris O'Donnell also deserves credit for his portrayal of another lost soul. It's hard to imagine someone else doing this part, that's how well he inhabits the role. The only problem is with the Hollywood style"" unrealistically optimistic ending. On the other hand, the entire movie is so emotionally devastating up until the final scene, that I'm actually thankful it ended on a positive note.The moral lesson (Slade's courtroom speech) might be unfashionable these days, but I find it commendable, especially because it has become something of a rarity in cinema. No ending and no flaws in the script could possibly diminish Pacino's performance, which remains amazingly real and touching.",Scent of a Woman
132,thomas-hardcastle-2,My Favourite Al Pacino Film...,8,2 June 2008,"I thought Scarfatchay was boring. I thought the Godfather was very good. I thought Any Given Sunday was boring. I thought The Devil's Advocate was good. I thought Heat was one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I thought Scent of a Woman was very good. As you can see, I think some of Pacino's films are terrific, and others are mind-numbingly boring.Scent of a Woman is a touching film, with comedic moments, mixed with tragedy. The two protagonists go on a journey (one willing, the other merely dragged along for the ride), and the climax to the film is a conclusion to what they have learned along the course of the weekend (film).I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending to the film is one of my favourite scenes in any film. Pacino deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frank Slade, and it is a shame that Chris O'Donnell appears to have fizzled away, because he showed a lot of promise in these early years.",Scent of a Woman

I have no clue how he ever got an opportunity to ever act again after this wretched pitiful performance.,Scent of a Woman
134,fred-houpt,One of Pacino's very best,9,13 April 2007,"If you like or admire actors, there is so much to love in Al Pacino. Having consistently given 100% of his talent over a long career, he is among a very small group of actors in any language who evoke epithets that verge on hero worship. He takes us to places in human experience that we often are too timid to explore on our own and we gratefully acknowledge the courage, we are thankful for having it portrayed for us. Unlike Brando, who hated what he was best at, Pacino continues to shine on, using his demons to craft and create penetrating and powerful re-creations of humanity, often on a large scale.The premise of this film is quite believable. Pacino's character is so burnt out that at any moment we expect him to either shoot at someone (a version of a blind mans 'road rage') or else see him destroy himself. And, this is the thread that runs through his character until the very end - but I won't spoil that. Pacino's character is meaty, deep, troubled, worldly, street wise, tough, bitter, frustrated. In short, many facets that sound a lot like Pacino. Would it then surprise us so much that his performance is so volcanic, cutting, as it probably does, closer to his own soul than we know? A true mensch of the ""method school"", he has dug into his own essence and what comes pouring out is so hot that Pacino just overwhelms the picture with his presence. There is in his character so much potential, but did you notice that we do not know all that much about him? He was a tough ass army man, attached to waiting on Lyndon Johnson. He relates the story several times in the movie but I get the impression that he hated this type of army service. He also reveals that he had first hand knowledge of the gory mess of war, perhaps in Vietnam. Again, we are not given too many details and we do not learn all that much about him. What we do know is that because of a foolish act (perhaps in a drunken state) he ended up blinding himself in an accident. The more we watch Pacino's character unwind, the more we (can) assume that this event might have much more to do with his incipient self-destructive (perhaps self-loathing) demons, than merely an accident. Did he want to blind himself, having just seen enough and having taken in enough pain for one lifetime? It's worth considering. Again, we do know that he is embittered and that his vision went from partial vision to total blindness over the last half year. So, when his young student shows up to take ""care"" of him over a weekend, he has arrived when the earthquakes have already been coming on and the full volcano is now erupting. Pacino's character has tipped over the edge and is ready to exit his pain. That he comes to change his mind is a surprise both to us and to him. Chris O'Donnell as Charlie Simms both irritated and then satisfied me. I was at first put off by how weak he seemed. Sure he had to face a furnace and his lines were not confrontational. He was supposed to be young, fresh, inexperienced, naive, etc. What I found a bit disappointing is that O'Donnell was either too young an actor or too shallow for the role. He just wilted under the withering storms that Pacino kept expelling. Pacino had little trouble mopping the floor with this young guy and after a while we just wished that some spine would be found to stand up and push back. Nothing. Later in the film I decided that to accept that Simms was just that: young, tender and just not blackened by the torment that inhabited Pacino's character. The contrast is a weakness in the film and it could have been even finer had the director urged O'Donnell to put up some resistance and thrown a few left hooks. Leaving this weakness aside, the story as it is keeps you glued to your chair. The thanksgiving dinner Pacino suckers O'Donnell into taking him to adds layers of self-loathing to his character. Had he gone ahead with his original plans, he would have left his family with the iron clad conviction that this was one bad dude, one hateful shell of a man that thankfully was no longer in their lives to dirty their shadows with. As he leaves the dinner, having upset everyone as much as possible, he pauses to admit to his brother ""I'm no good, never was"". Later in the film when he shouts out ""I'm in the dark here"" we now know it's a very lonely and hateful darkness and in this space almost anything can come about. Just like you can say ""...there was a lot of love to share"", this was a man with a lot of rage to share and share it he insisted on. The school-court scene is of course where Pacino makes a surprise visit. His speech, quoted by everyone, just about burns the house down, as he laments he would have done five years earlier. The beauty of this film takes place at that moment; he has clearly saved much more than Charlie Simms. He has saved his own soul, which was so much convinced that a final leap into the dark hole of death was the only answer left in a life turned cancerous. That moment is the catharsis we hoped for and we leave the film feeling sure that two good men will not take the road to oblivion. The road to perdition was transformed to the road to salvation. What a film. Pacino so deserved the Oscar. May he gain more.",Scent of a Woman

138,Sanou_san,Wonderfully moving film,10,20 October 2009,"I've always got interested watching Al Pacino on screen. I got used to his character playing the crime boss thing, but this movie had to be different. I didn't quite fully understand the background of Lt. Frank Slade's (Pacino) character in this movie (I need to watch it one more time), but in any case I appreciated the structure of story. You can see that Charlie Simms' (Chris O'Donnell) character is not that striking. He's a working student in a prestigious school, who got drawn in with his carefree wealthy ""friends"". Engaging himself in a thanksgiving job, because he ""doesn't have home to return"", and I meant it differently—his father was dysfunctional (and I surmise no mention of his mother). Nevertheless he's character is still interesting in some matters, especially at the final part of the movie. Though he seems weak and lame, he got integrity and loyalty to his friends (which is a shame because their not even his friends!) that made his character unyielding. Frank Slade on the other hand was more complex. But I learn to understand why he acted the way he had to in the film. He's alone, asserting he has no life because darkness only fills his eyes and dread to wish of dying some other time. But Charlie's character has something to do how Pacino's acted the role. Their characters get into mix and we saw a beautiful relationship build. Frank Slade was more of a true father (or uncle at least) to Chris more than anyone else.I loved the film because of the story itself. It's a good thing that we witness numerous stories with firm construction, got materialized into a movie, and got appreciated by many. I was even misled by the title, where what it was all about was not in the heading at all. I thought Scent of Woman has something to do with explicit portrayal of man to woman relationship, but this film got it different. I've been a keen follower of Al Pacino's career. And this movie has its legacy of showing his greatness in acting. Another one is that it amplified well Pacino's trademark voice, that distinct smoke-burnished voice (which honestly made me squirm because my uncle has the same feature as his).",Scent of a Woman

Al Pacino is a very interesting actor who plays a lot of roles.
I thought this film is one of the most unusual ones. He plays it very well.
The scene that becomes the turning point was very good. I think an incompetent director would have put a close-up of a body part in that scene, but this director didn't do that. The scene was very emotionally directed and the music was wonderful and moving.
By the way, the striking actress who came out in the middle of the film, Gabrielle Anwar, is super sexy.I've definitely seen this actress before, so I had to look her up. But I couldn't find any movies that I remember seeing. Maybe some of the movies I looked up was the one, but for the life of me, I can't remember which ones I saw. It's strange, isn't it, that I've completely forgotten the movies I've seen, but I can remember the faces of the actresses. A good woman is a really good thing.

142,bulleetz37235,Pretty Woman,9,9 September 2005,"This is a rather underrated film. I personally believe that if a film sets out to be as unrealistic as possible and achieves it, then it should be praised, and I reckon this film attempts to do this. With that established, you can now give this film all the respect it deserves, which in my opinion is nine stars worth. First of all the acting is brilliant. Al Pacino is fantastic as the arrogant, blind and slightly lovable ex-Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade. Chris O Donnell plays Charlie Simms. A shy somewhat naive student, with a problem at school, and his repulsive friends are played very well, especially George Willis Jr, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The story is totally unbelievable, as at first there is the school dilemma, in which Charlie saw a prank being played on the dean, who insists on expelling him if he doesn't fess up. Of course Charlie is the poor guy who can't afford to be expelled, whereas his other companion (George) who saw it, so we have a battle of classes. Of course by the end of the film, the poor and unfortunate succeeds to beckon the happy ending. Between the starting dilemma and the happy ending is the thanksgiving holiday, in which Charlie takes up the job of caring for 'an old relative' Frank. What starts off as a relationship where Charlie is scared of Frank, and Frank contemptuous of Charlie, but of course they make friends later on. The film watches these two com padres go to New York City, wine and dine in luxury, drive a Ferrari, and yep even the blind man has a go. They dance, and Frank teaches Charlie the facts of life. Yep it's a bag full of totally unbelievable story lines and events, yet the whole thing is well directed, acted and the overall feel-good factor is through the roof.

149,benighted2005,FANTASTIC ACTING BY PACINO.,10,13 September 2021,"This is Al Pacino's most memorable performance because his character is very cynical, most untrusting, extremely in-your face and overall Scent of a Woman is such a fun ride because he is there in almost every scene. The finesse with which the story explodes and presents itself is something that will make you yearn for more such films. The dialogues, oh my word, they are written so well. I saw this for the second time last night and I had to write a review. My favourite scene is one where Pacino decides to take his ""help"" to New York and the 20 or so minutes of fun and unpredictability that follow. Pacino is a very disturbed alcoholic in this film but beyond that there is a competitive grudge he surrounds himself with. He is a marvellous character and one that is so much fun to watch. I think he was more ""himself"" in this role than any other he has done. A 10/10 is obligatory.",Scent of a Woman

151,spenrh,"Great movie, Al Pacino's performance was very moving",9,18 December 2018,"A great coming of age film combined with good prep school movie dramedy. The whole movie is a dramedy, combined drama and comedy. Al Pacino, like in the Godfather films, gives another intense and colorful performance here, but his role as Colonel Slade is unique even to the Godfather due to him being blind on top of having alot of wit, emotion, and intelligent insight about life in general. He's got alot of bitterness also due to, as he yells at one point ""What life!? I have no life!! I'm in the dark here!!!"" to Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) after he tells him ""just get on with your life"". Other great lines include Slade saying ""conscience is dead"" to Charlie after telling Slade he has a conscience over him not wanting him to kill himself, and Slade responds ""that's right, you have the Charlie conscience, 'do we tell or not tell, do we follow the rich prep school boys' code or not, do we let this blind mo********* die or not'"". Slade shocks Charlie with his revelation about wanting to do himself in, but we see as the movie progresses the lengths Charlie will go to keep Slade from doing so. Charlie's revealing actions during the grimmest scene in the movie gained Slade a newfound respect for him which he wasn't previously holding, which was one of the ingredients which helped make Slade's very Oscar worthy 5 minutes during the point of the film when Charlie's future was on the line. It goes to show the new friendship they embraced, Charlie put in emense energy when Slade's life was on the line, then Slade returned the favor when Charlie's was.I do understand alot of Slade's points to Headmaster Mr Trask (James Coburn) after he tells Charlie straight out that his future will be jeopardized if he doesn't inform on who pulled a prank on him and his new Jaguar. It was a prank which Trask took very sorely. That's what Slade saying ""do we tell or not tell"" was related to. I understand Slade saying that it was a crock of **** that Charlie should be expelled and lose his chance at an Ivy league university over him not snitching on who's behind the prank.Seymour Phillip Hoffman had a few good scenes as one of the school's privileged rich kids who'll spend Thanksgiving with skiing and a fancy dinner in Vermont, and then Christmas in Switzerland. Charlie clearly had no interest in joining them in all their swanky (and expensive) excitement, he just wanted the weekend job with Al so he could pay for his plane ticket home to Oregon to spend Christmas with his mother (I'm just saying mother because Charlie revealed he didn't get along with his step-dad). This was the second prep school movie I've seen with Chris O'Donnell, he was also one of the prep school students in ""School ties"", but he was much more of a supporting character and had a much less pivotal role there than he had in this movie. But like in this movie, Chris still played a more quiet, good natured character in ""School ties"" who was one of the few characters who stood up for Brendan Frazier's Jewish character while many of the other students were being total bigots towards him.Slade had a couple of little parts in the movie which weren't as good as the rest. Like in the scene on the airplane, the way he was talking to Charlie about women, describing in detail their different body parts, that was a little embarrassing. And then him telling Charlie he was giving him pearls there. However, many of Slade's other scenes were fabulous and still made his role in this film overall outstanding.Other great scenes here was the entire Ferrari section of the movie and the part with Slade dancing the tango with beautiful Gabriel Anwar, the latter which really brought out his smooth and romantic side, then him showing great wit (with the Ferrari dealer), and him being intelligent enough throughout this movie that the scene of him driving the Farrari blind was actually believable. His comment while doing the tango, ""if you slip up, just tango on"" did a great job with fitting into other parts of the movie. Scent of a woman is a great movie.",Scent of a Woman

In this case, however, I am proud to admit it. You must watch the entire movie before that scene to get its real impact. But that's a pleasant task, indeed. I will never tire of that scene. It is truly beautiful on every level, from the first sighting of that lovely young woman, through the tour-de-force blind-dancing performance by Al Pacino, until she is spirited away by her boyfriend, the one who thinks the tango is ""hilarious"". Watch this movie! Watch this scene! There are other scenes which rate close to tops: The Ferrari Test Drive... And, of course, The Pseudo-Courtroom ""Speech"" by Frank Slade, Lt. Col., U.S. Army (Retired). But, to me, that amazing Tango scene rates absolute first place.The entire movie is wonderfully understated, in the sense that one can so easily imagine neat additional dialog: rejoinders, exposition, wise-cracks, ""score-one-for-me"" stuff that was so intelligently never added, or perhaps eliminated before the final release. That one characteristic makes the movie excellent, above all else. Kudos for everyone involved in its production. This movie really is one of the great ones.

The story is interesting and engrossing, the acting powerful and the sentiments spot on. Considerateness and sincerity win over cynicism in a superbly crafted school hall scene at the end.  Pacino is at his very best.  The title seems to me to mislead somewhat, since the response to blindness is not the first thing to enter one's head on hearing it.  Yet it is a very romantic film.  Except for a very brief interlude with the sweet Miss Anwar, it is without a leading lady.  I do enjoy the work of these very meticulous directors. Highly recommended.",Scent of a Woman

His expressions, movement, dialogue delivery and acting is flawless in the movie and sometimes you forget that he is actually acting. Chris O'Donnell does a good supporting job as a school student who is need of some money and agrees to take care or babysit of this fiery character.The Director does a good job with the other things of the film. The Screenwriter did a superb job with the screenplay and wrote some excellent dialogues which were perfectly delivered by Pacino.

This movie (which in my opinion displays one of Pacino's finest acting work) is a realistic ride of a depressing man ""I'm in the dark here!"" that finds himself at one of the most difficult crossroads in his life.Desperation; rudeness; honesty; anger and love are so intense and passionately displayed by Pacino that everyone can sense them, and as viewers we have no option but to sympathise with his Frank Slade and immerse ourselves in the story of this blind man that apparently everyone hates, but in reality everyone wants to love and understand.The side story of the Baird student is well put together by Chris O'Donnell but Al Pacino steals the show, as he portrays a blind man so perfectly that we easily forget that he is Al Pacino and we start to think of him as a harsh Lieutenant Colonel.Truth and honesty are not usual synonyms that one can say about a Hollywood movie but Al Pacino turns himself into his characters, and this movie should be presented in every acting school as the finest example of truth in acting.I don't know how many times I've seen this movie but every time I do I enjoy it, and appreciate the hard work that was done throughout it.

Pacino's character is a blind ex-colonel who is a bitter and unwilling man. But a turning point is brought by a student hired temporarily as his assistant. Colonel goes with the assistant to New York on a trip that is supposed to be his last. On the way we see a memorable tango scene between colonel and a young beautiful woman. Eventually the assistant manages to change colonel's mind and they make friends. A final scene at assistant's school is very impressive.
Al Pacino is impressive. This is absutely one of his best role works in his career. But other actors do their jobs very well too. Scent of a Woman is the best drama movie I have seen for now.

This movie showed how you can overcome obstacles despite a certain condition you may have in this case blindness. I think this movie had a fantastic plot because it can inspire so many people who have disabilities and people who don't. I was certainly inspired from this movie. The complete manner in which Pacino inhabits this role is a stroke of studied genius: as a blind man his every physical and verbal movements are wholly convincing. There are many fine moments in this film, not the least of which is the famous Tango scene, or the confrontation between Charlie and Slade regarding a suicide plan.

This would be laughed off the stage in Argentina. However I thought that Pacino and the young lady did it well. I counted the length of the shots in the dance and the camera changed shots every six or seven seconds. This means that they did the dance in very short segments, or they did it complete, and it was edited in short clips. I don't know how it was shot, but if they did it in one take I applaud them.If I heard correctly, Slade's blindness was due to juggling hand grenades. Well don't hand grenades that close tear your head off, or, at the very least, horribly disfigure one. Or maybe Col. Slade ""ducked"" just in time.The best moments for me, were Bradley Whitford of ""The West Wing"" telling Slade what a bastard he was at the Thanksgiving dinner and, the then unknown Seymour Phillip Hoffman as the campus wise guy. Hoffman, as befits a great actor, got into the business, to meet a girl in his school drama club.

Nevertheless, this movie, despite being a little dull and boring, is worth watching, mostly so because of the marvelous acting by Al Pacino.I usually don't like to watch long movies, especially the ones above 150 minutes. (Mostly, because I can't find time enough to watch them in one sitting.) If this movie was made 10 years later, it would've been cut down at least by half an hour. And that would've been okay because this movie can get really boring... really fast.Now, Al Pacino's acting is really top notch. So is Chris O'Donnell's. And that is the only thing that holds this movie together. Because, all in all, many such movies have been made by now.

182,rah604,'Scent of a Woman',9,23 April 2004,"Al Pacino gives one of his best performances as Lt. Colonel Frank Slade. This blind and retired colonel is certainly a bitter and disagreeable man. Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a college student, realizes this immediately after taking a thanksgiving weekend job to look after the colonel. Simms, being a non-financially secure student, reluctantly accepts the job. What Simms doesn't know is that the colonel plans to go to New York, where he plans to live the high life, make love to a beautiful woman and blow his brains out.All of the performances in the film are of the excellent variety. O'Donnell, giving a charming and heartfelt performance that matches up well with the Slade's harsh and amusing antics and provides stability to the film. But this is Pacino's show, he is definitely at the top of his game in this fiery and touching performance.  In the best scene of the film, a tango dance between Slade and a gorgeous woman (Gabrielle Anwar), we see the colonel's compassionate side that Pacino plays with much tenderness.Even though the subplot involving Charlie facing a dilemma with regards to snitching on his classmates is definitely weak and things are tied up to cleanly at the end of the film, it is still a fine piece of filmmaking. It's great to watch Pacino work his acting chops in creating something so memorable.Rating: (9/10)",Scent of a Woman

Right on this page is a link to an article about Oscars that were ""mistakes""and that includes this one. I just saw this again for the first time since I saw it in the theatre in 1992. It still moved me. This was not a sympathy Oscar. It was fully deserved. Pacino was brilliant and I am so fed up when I come across this kind of reassessment which implies that the entire Academy voted in some temporary trance. No. I am so tired of people saying this movie is only known for the ""hu-ah."" Hardly. How about actually watching it to the end. It's about morality and the human spirit. A blind, broken vet finding a common humanity and bonding with a young student who is hired to look after him. They both have something vital to offer to each other through the course of the few days they spend together. No, it's not a shoot-em-up western or a violent mafia bloodbath or a sci-fi CGI blockbuster. It's an old style human drama and you can't help loving the characters.

Likewise the Baird gang: Rebhorn, Seymour Hoffman, and even Conroy.Memorable scenes include the Ferrari test-drive, the Thanks Giving family event, the final gun scene, and the disciplinary committee hearing. But the film history die was struck hard, with the tango scene. Pacino and Anwar play their roles to the full, a confident blind aficionado dance lead and a young, stunningly beautiful but humble, sophisticated ""amateur"" follow.Thomas Newman graces the film with an original music score worthy of his reputation par excellance.

With a unique and strange blend of boldness, emotion, cars, booze, women, etc, this movie seems to pull it off perfectly, effectively and with a hint of class. Both Al Pacino and Chris O'Donnell do an excellent job of performing as the roles of Lt. Col. Frank Slade and Charles Simms. As if they were born to take those roles, they both seem to slip into the character with complete accuracy. Not only do we see a great blend of fascinating material; but we also see a large amount of versatility in Pacino. We see a person who is both bold and sensitive, angry and supportive, etc, etc. As for O'Donnell, we see a character who's naive and understanding, smart and gentle. What I'm getting at is that ""Scent of a woman"" is a movie of great excellence and would probably be enjoy by anyone.",Scent of a Woman
187,marianajb,Whoo-ah,9,24 October 2016,"It is definitely a great movie, and personal favorite! With no doubt Al Pacino's performance got me speechless; once someone told me: ""When you see a good movie, performance, screenplay, etc; you cry because it is really good."" At first I took it as a metaphor, but then it actually happened, it happened while I was watching his performance in this movie. Besides that, I love the passion and romance that appears in this movie, and it is all reflected in Al's character, he may seem stubborn at first but then you realize what a beautiful ""human spirit"" he has and worships those spirits of the ones he loves. Taking Charlie to an adventure he will never forget, but what he doesn't know is that Coronel's life changed too.

188,zhongzl-kelley2014,People like it less when time flows by,6,23 August 2015,"Maybe you can detect the downward sloping trend in the reviews from 1999 to 2007 here. A few years later, people will view this piece as a relic and open it only for academic purposes. That's right, this is a classic, but time can easily wash away the cheap spirit embodied in this film. Therefore I might be the last one to comment on this outdated film here. But to pay my respect for the wealth and effort that was squandered on this production, and my laborious 2 hours straining myself from smashing the screen, I'll write something anyway.The reviews render Al Pacino's acting worthy of an Oscar, but I have to argue otherwise. Sometimes the stress of the sentence sounds strange, like he suddenly remembered the next word is the point he roared, so he jumped abruptly from a chastising to a explosion, leaving the audience perplexed and uncomfortable. Someone says he is passionate, sometimes he forget the boundary between Lt. Slade and himself. That is a highest accolade invented for actors, because only the VIP class actors can walk in and out characters' inner world with ease. And I won't deny the sense of sincerity that sometimes drifts out casually, Al Pacino should take the credit for this, but he doesn't deserve the Oscar because his talent is blocked by a braggart screenplay writer. The movie was a product of 1992, we should respect flaws in the technique of camera angles and editing the way we respect a old man for walking slow and saying gibberish. But the huge paragraphs in the scene in which Lt. Slade contradicts the headmaster about his decision to expel Charles, I think the whole paragraph about right path wrong path can be spared, because it sounds like an old men's annoyingly didactic speech. His fury suits perfectly in the plot, but the effect will definitely be more stunning if he didn't go on and on for 1500 words. I wanted to cry in my palm, because according to a ancient movie theory, it you take out all the fantastic lines, the movie is still tasty, then it's a good movie. A Scent of Woman without all the breath-drawing lines is more barren than a dessert, which is why it deserves to be left in the dust and wither in time.I'll recommend this movie to my uncle who is going through a mid-life crisis, but definitely not to anyone who still believe in hope, love, future and dream. If you are a shallow person that has faith in lust and pompous bragging and empty shell of wealth, this is the movie to go. I believe it's your fault if all your family hate you and seem embarrassed when you show up, Lieutenant, and I believe it's your fault if you are trying to shoot yourself knowing it will jeopardize a sweet boy that pity you and take care of you all the way. The police will doubt if Charles murder you for your wealth, and that still can't explain why you has a grasp on so huge amount of money to enjoy such luxury. A good man would give the money to the Rosie's for they live such a humble life with you sitting on hundreds of bucks and Mrs, Rosie still firmly believe that you are ""sweet in the heart."" Shame on you, Lieutenant.It's not a good movie for Saturday night's fun, but it's a great movie to gnaw your fingers at because it's your weekend assignment, and scratch a few words about and get it over with. I must mourn for my precious 2 hours, for I could have watched Schindler's List with it.",Scent of a Woman
189,critical-escapist,A pleasurable Thanksgiving weekend in New York,9,11 August 2006,"The first time I watched Scent of a Woman, I was alone in my room and it was nearing around midnight. I had borrowed the DVD from the local library and had very low expectations for it and knew little of the film's plot other than what the DVD box had offered. I was still wide-awake so I popped the DVD into the player just to get some entertainment. Scent of a Woman would then become one of my personal favorites. For the next 2hrs and 37min I will be pleasantly surprised by this dramatic but also lightly comedic film that I felt sad when it ended.Al Pacino, who is one of the prolific actors of his time breaks out of his usual gangster persona to play Lt. Col. Frank Slade, a blind man who meets his complete opposite and most unlikely friend. Prep school student Charlie Simms (a pre-Robin Chris O'Donnell), desperate for a job during the Thanksgiving weekends so he can earn enough money to spend Christmas back at his home in Oregon, is hired to ""babysit"" Frank while the family goes on a trip that Frank refused to go along with. Little did Charlie know, Frank already has already purchased tickets to New York where he will eventually enjoy himself with expensive restaurants, big hotels, and a beautiful woman. At the end of his trip, he plans to commit suicide because he simply cannot tolerate his blindness anymore.There is a subplot involving Charlie's fiasco at his prep school. After witnessing a prank on the school headmaster's beloved car, Charlie is asked to spill the names of the members behind the prank in order to be bribed for a chance to enter Harvard University, or find himself in great trouble. The other student who also witnessed the prank is a rich-snob-type, George (a pre-Capote Philip Seymour Hoffman), who may have been behind the prank as well. We can think Charlie is ridiculously naive, but Frank takes note of Charlie's integrity and admires him for it, and for some reason, we should too. The subplot is a bit silly if you really think about it, but then again, without this subplot, one of the best speeches I have ever seen in film will never exist -- and that is the speech that earned Pacino his first Oscar, twenty years and seven nominations later.What is so great about Pacino's performance is not just because he plays a blind man, but he makes a very unlikable character into an object of sympathy. We hate him because we can't stand him, but we like him because he respects Charlie's integrity like no one else does. In a way, Pacino IS the film because without his performance, this film wouldn't have the same greatness. And even the ""Hoo-ah!"" would sound different if it was performed by another actor -- and we won't want that to happen! Another strong point is that Pacino never makes O'Donnell into his walking shadow and this gives a chance for his co-star to shine as well. Maybe O'Donnell didn't deliver a performance as heartbreaking and wonderful as Pacino, but the two actors were able to produce perfect chemistry and their absurd friendship seemed truly believable.There is a scene in this movie where Frank visits his family. We watch as everyone in the house looks at him with their unwelcoming eyes. Frank can sense it, but he tries to make the best of it since he still has his planned suicide in mind. He tries to have a Thanksgiving meal with his family, only to fall into an argument with his nephew (Bradley Whitford). That was the moment that I really sympathized Frank because it felt like he was someone who had finally come to terms with his blindness but regrets his past, but he isn't ready to be nice about it.Even with its long runtime, the film manages to be very entertaining as the audience watches Frank dancing the tango with a young woman (Gabrielle Anwar, in one of the film's most memorable moments) to Frank driving the Ferrari at full-speed. Even in the most dramatic moments, I didn't find one boring second to this film. As Frank shouts to Charlie, ""I'm in the dark, here!"" I felt a strong chill going through me as if I finally understood Frank.After seeing this film, you would be surprised that this film was directed by Martin Brest, the same guy who gave us -- you guessed it -- Gigli. He does such a superb job in this film even when the script (written by Bo Goldman, who adapted the 1974 Italian film, Profumo di donna) is attached with the standard Hollywood formula. What lead the audience overlook the formula was the marvelous character-driven plot and the lively, humorous, and quotable dialogue. The film is about friendship between two very different people who were able to help each other in their time of need. Scent of a Woman also contains one of the best feel-good endings ever (maybe because it actually felt good) as both men discovers a new purpose to life and a new will to live.",Scent of a Woman

Two equally matched spirits operating on opposite ends of the spectrum find a balance and symbiosis that is difficult to create. Amid a seemingly one dimensional bucket list formula, this film delivers strong character development, superior acting and several wonderful surprises. Little bits of spice are added throughout to maintain audience engagement. The conclusion is a well written wrap up that pulls it all together in a way that leaves the experience feeling complete.

193,prateak09,Probably one of the finest movies of all time...Al Pacino is the life of the movie...,9,1 June 2011,"Adapted by Bo Goldman from the novel Il buio e il miele (Italian: Darkness and Honey) by Giovanni Arpino and from the 1974 screenplay for the movie Profumo di donna by Ruggero Maccari and Dino Risi, Martin Brest's 'Scent Of A Woman' is evergreen classic from the early 90′s. Movies often have lines that become part of our culture. The line from this one is hoo-ha!This film may look plain but it isn't: it's a very strong one, showing us how someone who lost all faith in life (Frank – Al Pacino) can learn from someone whose life may end by doing something right (Charlie – Chris O'Donnell): not selling himself for his future. At the same time, Charlie will learn that sometimes you shouldn't trust everything people tell you: usually it is easier to speak the right thing than actually DO the right thing. It is a beautiful film, to be watched peacefully: believe me, if in the beginning you will wonder how it is possible that someone like Colonel Frank Slade, by the end you will like him more that you thought possible.SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992) is an outstanding piece of work! The legendary Al Pacino FINALLY took home the coveted Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant work in this film and he shouldn't have to apologize for it. Yes, he should have won for his work in THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE, but too many actors to be named have been sadly overlooked for their best work.Pacino perfectly essays the role of retired Colonel Frank Slade, who was compelled to retirement being blinded during duty(due to his own stupidity and drinking habit). Stuck living with his niece and her family in their guest house and drawing monthly stipends from the government, Col. Slade is an embittered man of late middle age. Slade's niece has hired local boys' school student Charlie Simms (young Chris O'Donnell in a very underrated, genuine performance) to take care of Frank for the weekend during the Thanksgiving holidays. Slade opts to take Charlie with him on a weekend of luxury and reckless abandon in New York. Meanwhile, Charlie must wrestle with the moral dilemma of ""should he or shouldn't he"" squeal on his fellow classmates, who he along with another student saw commit a punishable act prior to the holidays. Charlie is to go before the disciplinary board upon his return. Charlie and Frank are two extraordinary actors in the film, ""Scent of a Woman."" They are a perfect pair, one who has always stood firmly for what he believes in and the other one who is learning how to do just that.Still of Al Pacino and Gabrielle Anwar in Scent Of A WomanAl Pacino is extraordinary, he steals every scene he is in, truly crafting a superb and incredible performance. One of his greatest performances ever and in the history of cinema. Chris O'Donnell is marvelous, a great performance. It's absolutely unforgettable and flawless. The supporting cast is golden, too .Gabrielle Anwar (charming as the beautiful young lady that Slade gets to tango with!), the always reliable James Rebhorn (pitch perfect as the stern headmaster of the boys' school), a young-looking Phillip Seymour Hoffman (terrific as Charlie's shifty ""best friend"" at the boy's school, who was his fellow witness), Richard Venture (as Frank's older brother W.R. Slade), a young Bradley Whitford (wonderful as Frank's resentful nephew Randy in my favorite scene of the film!), Ron Eldard (winning as the NY cop who stops Slade and Charlie for speeding), and a young and vibrant Frances Conroy (as an English teacher at Charlie's school who I always imagine that Frank ends up with!).There are great scenes in ""Scent of a Woman"" from the ruckus at Thanksgiving dinner when Frank takes Charlie, both uninvited, to his brother's house where the relatives don't think much of him to at one point driving a Ferrari despite being blind. But the most wonderful moments are the few on the dance floor. The scene of Frank(Al) and Donna(Gabrielle) doesn't get out of my thoughts. From the moment he catches her perfume, through the introduction, till the sweetest tango dance ever. Of course, the choice for Donna – Gabrielle Anwar, is perfect, she plays the shy (very) pretty woman very good. The scene when the colonel wants to shoot himself and suddenly decides to shoot the boy,too is brilliant. The fight between the two men -as well as Charlie's attempt to convince the colonel give up his plan- is full of suspense and very well structured, so it's impossible to anticipate how the things will work out. The climax scene in the disciplinary meeting, though a bit clichéd, is wonderful. Pacino's speech is absolutely amazing. He delivers it with a panache.The big lesson from SCENT OF A WOMAN is about the true meaning of honor. I like the dichotomy of Slade's situation with Charlie's and how Charlie, the student, inadvertently teaches Slade a valuable life lesson, that through the toughest of times and situations, it is the human SPIRIT that must remain intact if one is to truly LIVE!Riveting, electrifying and satisfying. A magnificent film. A heartfelt, funny and outstanding experience. Powerful and very touching throughout. An excellent movie in every way. Superb storytelling and stunningly crafted. A towering and masterful drama. Wickedly funny and spectacular. A film you cant turn away from. You cant stop but smile when you think of this movie. A two and a half hour pleasure from start to finish.Nominated for Best Picture, directed by Oscar nominated director Martin Brest (MIDNIGHT RUN, BEVERLY HILLS COP) and starring the one and only Al Pacino in his Oscar-winning role, SCENT OF A WOMAN is a film to enjoy over and over! I refer it to everyone, everyone who want to watch a beautiful movie with great performances. I rate it 9 out of 10.",Scent of a Woman
194,rt-ingram,A very good character drama,7,10 November 2016,"Scent of a Woman is one of those films with a not so terribly exciting plot, but once you get past that, is actually very good. The story is rather downbeat - with the main character wanting to do several things before ending his life – but the film is helped strongly by the performances of the cast.Al Pacino is simply excellent as Frank Slade and you can see why he won the Oscar; he is quite aggressive when we first see him, but we soon realise there is more to him than what we first think. Chris O'Donnell is very good as Charlie, and the rapport between both characters is entirely believable. This is what's needed for the film to succeed, and it does. The supporting cast are all on fine form, and there isn't one character you dislike.The highlight is, without a doubt, the tango scene, however, there are other noteworthy scenes, including the highly amusing part where Slade drives the Ferrari, the school prank on the headmaster and the dramatic showdown in the hotel where Slade very nearly kills himself.The only part that lets it down is the last half hour in the school. It drags on for too long and doesn't fit in with the story. It's a shame, because all that happened before was excellent. Despite this preventing me giving out full marks, I quite like Scent of a Woman.",Scent of a Woman

198,petersaarloos,Hard to rate,6,1 January 2021,"How do you go about rating a film? It is mostly mediocre, if not downright bad, but it is saved by two important things.What's bad? Well for starters, the dialogue of this piece is strange and wooden. At first, you are inclined to think it is a gimmick of Al Pacino's character, until you find yourself cringing at some horrible lines. The film is either trying too hard to force tension between characters (such as the dinner scene, where all the characters are weirdly okay with their uncle's, ahem, rather violent behavior) or the 'public hearing' in which the whole school is brought to witness something surely most students have no need to care about, but cheer as though they're at a rock concert.The interaction that works reasonably well is that between Chris O'Donnell and Al Pacino, mostly because the latter does all the heavy lifting. A special mention should be made for Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who manages to give his character colour despite having been giving little on the pallet. Chris O'Donnells portrayal of a meek schoolboy is adequate but forgettable.The plot is also flawed and unhinged. The matters occurring at the school are so detached from Frank and Charlie's adventure in New York, it feels stitched in just to get some tension going in Charlie's life. In fact, the trip to New York in itself doesn't make much sense.All these flaws seem best explained by the interpretation that a script was written around an idea for a character for Al Pacino to play. This, as you'd expect, is the redeeming quality of the film. Not only does Al Pacino deliver an outstanding performance as Colonel Frank Slade, it also breathes life into the theme of a strange, lonely man, so used to being powerful and potent that he cannot bear any compromise to his stature. Al Pacino is so good, in fact, that it almost seems as though this theme was intended.I would not recommend watching this before any of Al Pacino's better works, because you're really just watching this for Al Pacino, but if you're a fan of his than this is worth a watch.",Scent of a Woman
199,yuenw003,The Odor of Indoctrination,10,15 December 2017,"Al Pacino's brilliance is in his ""closing arguments performances, i.e And Justice for All, Devil's Advocate. If Pacino didn't become an actor, he would have made a great criminal trial lawyer. Most of The Scent of a Woman runs through little incidentals to establish character and a relationship between student Charlie Simms who is hired as retired Lt Col Frank's (who is blind) ""guide dog"" through a ""live it up"" outing in New York during the holidays. The real meat of this movie comes in the climatic monologue when Lt. Col. Frank Slade,, Al Pacino defends Charlie Simms, Chis O'Donnel against charges of misconduct in a school hearing. Pacino's brilliant testimony is a harsh critque on our current school system and how it discourages instead of encourages the growth of character and morality in our youths.",Scent of a Woman

204,deetya,Frank Slade is a wuss,3,25 April 2012,"To say Frank Slade is scum would be an insult to scums everywhere ^_^ He is supposed to be this rough and tough guy, but the Thanksgiving dinner scene reveals his cowardice. It's not intended to show his cowardice, of course, the scene is supposed to show how Slade is still a man of action, a dangerous man able to kill, even when blind. But a little thinking shows just how much of a coward he is.We find that he's been insulting his family for years now. He seems to especially reserve his venom towards Randy and his wife. Now, what kind of a man insults a woman? A coward, I would think.Then Randy turns the table and starts giving him a rough time. Just 10 seconds, and suddenly Slade had Randy at the throat. Wow, macho man can't stand even 10 seconds of ribbing? What a wimp! Of course, it has to be said, that though blind, Slade is a military man, well trained to kill. Randy, on the other hand, is just a soft civilian. It's no contest really. Again, this shows what a pansy Slade is, using his lethal training against unarmed and unwarned civilians.Randy's story of how Slade got blind also shows Slade's gutlessness. He talked tough, but when push came to shove, he chickened-out and basically caused his own blindness. Hail the gutless hero! What a yellow-bellied spineless wimp.Al Pacino played him with gusto, and his performance salvaged the film. His performance is so good that viewers everywhere basically overlooked his spine jelly.

O'Donnell is weak in his performance, lacking the necessary resolve to face off with someone like Lt. Col. Frank Slade).There's joy in this movie, if you want it. There's a wonderful glee that can be obtained from lines such as, ""Outta order? I SHOW you outta order! You don't know what outta order IS, Mister Trask. I'd show ya, but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too f------ blind. If I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a FLAMETHROWER to this place!""And there is case in point of way Pacino deserves the hype he gets. That flamethrower thing--that's a bad line. But Pacino, God that he is, makes it convincing and severely threatening. He has the intensity to turn bad lines like that into good lines. That is genius, and it makes for enjoyable films.""How's that for corn ball?""",Scent of a Woman
207,monkeyface_si,Pretentious and abusive,3,7 July 2001,"I adore Al Pacino.  He deserved the Oscar for his performances in Serpico, Godfather II, and Dog Day Afternoon.  What a shame that the movie he finally won it for is so poorly written and that his character is so one-note.  He is angry because he is blind.  He is abusive because he is blind.  He curses because he's blind.  Chris O'Donnell is cute as a button but clueless as to his motivation in the role.  The supporting cast is amateurish and without direction.  Overall this is one of the most pretentious films I have ever seen.",Scent of a Woman

Chris O'Donnel plays Charlie Simms, the poor, innocent college student, looking to make a few dollars to pay for plane fare home for Christmas by baby sitting Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino), a difficult blind man. Well, the minute Simms and Slade are alone, Slade is running the show, taking Simms on a wild and luxurious trip to New York that is all about fun, fun, fun.Lieutenant Slade is tremendously proud yet so alone, he shows up uninvited at his brothers house for Thanksgiving, and the family members can only offer a few weak and fake smiles, as Slade begins to dominate through tirade. But these family members do not find him amusing, in fact, one relative tells Simms that the Lieutenant was always an a__hole, long before he went blind.Simms and Slade each have their own compelling dramas unfolding as they battle and bond with each other, and they discover how much they need each other.I really feel Pacino took average dialogue and made it sizzle. Chris O'Donnel sounds a lot like Toby McGuire, and it was fun to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing a young college kid.",Scent of a Woman

That said, I'd suggest that readers try finding a copy of the film ""Scent of a Woman"" was based on: the Italian-made ""Profumo di Donna,"" starring Vittorio Gassman. Gassman's interpretation is much different, and the film -- though a comedy in the universal sense -- more serious. Gassman's character is an unlikeable failure, with little to recommend him. The intrusive prep school subplot in Pacino's version makes no appearance in the Italian.Unfortunately ""Profumo di Donna"" has yet to be released on DVD, only on VHS.

I notice a new riff every time I watch it - tonight it was when Chris O'Donnell asks for Pacino's gun, he tells him it's a ""weapon"" or ""piece"", never a ""gun"", then a minute later, exasperated, tells him ""I'm not givin' you my f***in' gun!""  (yes, they did that on purpose, you fools!)  Stuff like that cracks me up and Pacino works a great script and a great character.Lest you think this is a comedy or something, let me assure you the movie does have a message. In fact, it's got two or three, but it's never heavy-handed about it, which I appreciated as well.

Not one of his better roles, IMHO.(*spoilers*) The whole thing was a bit too heart warming all in, for my taste.

His performance would be on my top 10 best male performances of all time, next to PS Hoffman in Capote since that was a brilliant performance. When an actor plays a blind character, there are ways to tell if he is really looking at things or if he is just faking. With Pacino, you really believed he was blind because he never appears to look at anything, and he is extremely perceptive. Blind people rely on their already heightened other 4 senses anyway.The movie also has some great lines from Pacino as well. It's a serious drama, but there is a lot of comedy too.

I realize that most find this movie to be a bit long, but I always find myself wishing that it wouldn't end.  Maybe I'm a sap, but I adore this film from beginning to end.

When I spotted that old style clothes and hair I immediately decided the film was terrible. But still I kept watching it and, by the end, I had regretted my decision.This is probably my favorite film of all times: until the tango scene I was convinced the guy playing Lt. Colonel Frank Slade was, indeed, blind - only later I found out he was Al Pacino, the actor I have heard so much off but hat never seen before in any film. Also, at first I thought Chris O'Donnell was a little bit too zen, but then I realized: it's exactly how the character is supposed to be. More, since Colonel is such an imposing and, sometimes, impertinent character, he was exactly what was necessary in the film.This film may look plain but it isn't: it's a very strong one, showing us how someone who lost all faith in life (Frank - Al Pacino) can learn from someone whose life may end by doing something right (Charlie - Chris O'Donnell): not selling himself for his future. At the same time, Charlie will learn that sometimes you shouldn't trust everything people tell you: usually it is easier to speak the right thing than actually DO the right thing.It is a beautiful film, to be watched peacefully: believe me, if in the beginning you will wonder how it is possible that someone like Colonel Frank Slade, by the end you will like him more that you thought possible.",Scent of a Woman
223,alice_imk2005,Wonderful,9,17 July 2010,"The film presents the compelling story of the friendship between a teenager and a blind, old man. The sense of justice the boy possesses conquers the former colonel, who up to him, no longer believed he has any reason to live. He had lost the respect for humanity and no longer hoped there are still just people left in this world. But the boy proves him wrong by standing besides him when no one else cared. He risks his life to save an old man he has only known for 2 days. Thus, a babysitting job turns into a friendship-reasoned help. The film captures the weekend the two of them spend in New York, which was supposed to constitute the last days of the colonel. But with Charlie's help and encouragement, these two days turn out to be the labor of a new life for colonel Slade.The climax is the scene when the colonel wants to shoot himself and suddenly decides to shoot the boy,too. The fight between the two men -as well as Charlie's attempt to convince the colonel give up his plan- is full of suspense and very well structured, so it's impossible to anticipate how the things will work out.After all this tension, the film's ending emanates hope and puts a smile on anyone's face.

226,filmaniacist,One of Pacino's greatest,10,15 December 2016,"This movie is all about the acting and the immerse message by the end. Al Pacino delivers an Academy Award winning performance without exception and captures us as his character Lt. Colonel Frank Slade. Al Pacino went lengths to prove his 'blindness' to us (taught by the infamous Lee Strasberg), by being helped by a school to prep, was in character off screen and by not allowing his eyes to focus on anything. While nursing his self-pity and arrogance with alcohol, Slade finds new meaning (as he is blind and was 'passed over for promotion' during his time in the military) in the young Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) who becomes his caretaker during the weekends. We are compelled under the mean, angry and sarcastic man Slade is and we sense that somehow he's always been like that, but that it will change by the interaction and creation of friendship with Charles. Causing the blindness by his own stupidity, yet there's no pity you feel for him as he's abrasive and seeks every possible way to insult you. However, two traits motivate us to like him, his romantic side and his humor. And the compassion grows.Charlie is the shy, hardworking poor young man that we relate to. Coming from West, he's studying at the exclusive local prep school on a scholarship with no money to spare and enjoys watching over Slade for a dollar or two. What is captivating is the way Slade wants him under his wings to educate Charlie through his experiences. The way Slade tells Charlie that women are God's greatest creation, the dancing scene with Donna (Gabrielle Anwar) tells us how much he misses and how he realized what he's lost being a soldier. Finally he doesn't seem as negative and destructive, he seems happy as he dances gracefully with Donna. And gradually through the movie, we learn and grow fond of Slade's state and find compassion for his attitude and faults. Bo Goldman, who wrote the screenplay, is more interested in conveying an active chemistry between the actors, than focusing on the plot. The collaboration between Slade and Charlie is immaculate. The problem occurring is when Charlie witnesses three of his fellow students pulling a prank that damaged the headmasters Jaguar. But Charlie didn't want to be the snitch everyone loathes, so he remain silenced, even though the consequence is being expelled from the school. This is where one of the greatest speeches in movie history enters the picture (the relativity of it is another story) when Slade sees the great, potential, young man Charles is for not ratting out his 'friends' while the other accused one is hiding behind 'big daddy's pocket'. To stand up for what's right and moral, through his speech, Slade reminisces about his past while explaining that having integrity and courage is what creates leaders. Everything he said in that speech is accurate. Inspirational. Meaningful.If it was anyone else playing the character Al Pacino plays, I'm confident it wouldn't have the same weight on the speech. By showing his anger, by presenting the facts, by conveying the message to the disciplinary commitment successfully, Al Pacino reached his peak of acting and had us all mistaken by the character. The versatility of Slade's character and strong performance of Al Pacino is what makes this movie a great movie, even though the plot was rather shallow. Scent of a Woman is an exceptional movie, especially for young minds.",Scent of a Woman

Al Pacino delivers both dialogue and monologue in an involving method which the viewer will never forget.  The first meeting of Charlie and Frank is spellbinding as Frank is ""looking for a brain"".
The flaw in this movie is ironically its finest point, the final scene.  It is the resolution of both Charlie's conflict, and Frank's search for a purpose in life, as Frank uses intimidation tactics to trick everyone into forgeting basic ethics.  Yes, ""snitching"" is annoying and lousy, (who can forget the playground tatle-tale of their youth?), but lying is even worse. True integrity would have been to ID the bums to whom he  had no true loyalty, but not accept any reward for it.  Indeed he should have exposed the Headmaster's bribery attempt.  The ""prank"" would not have been a success without the Headmaster's pride and arrogance.

237,harvbenn,May the next version be the best one yet,7,27 January 2016,"The story concerns an old man and a young man. The old man was once formidable. He saw and achieved much. Then, at the height of his powers, he was struck down by an accident that left him disabled and dependent on others. He takes refuge in cynicism, bigotry, and bullying the few people who can still stand to be around him. The young man, as the story opens, is just a kid. He has promise of a sort. He studies hard, takes jobs at school and on the outside for extra cash, and knows how to obey authority. He may be destined to be just a cog, but he's going to be a cog in a classy wheel somewhere. One long weekend, the old warrior needs a substitute caretaker, and the young man needs an extra job for money to see his family. They meet, to their mutual dismay. The old man considers the boy a scrub-faced wimp and tells him so, between gulps of whiskey, puffs of cigar smoke, and ghastly war stories. The shocked young man looks frantically for a fire exit. The man decides he's going to see some old stomping grounds and make the weekend an adventure, with his temporary valet in tow. The boy feels obligated to go. After all, his default mode is obedience, even if the boss is a raving, obnoxious nut case.This wonderful plot idea has yielded first, a 1969 novel by Italian author Giovanni Arpino (who also wrote the book on which ""Divorce Italian Style"" is based); and two movies - Dino Risi's Profumo di Donna in 1974, with Vittorio Gassman, and Martin Brest's 1992 work, Scent of a Woman, which earned Al Pacino an Academy Award for Best Actor (yes, it should have been Denzel Washington for ""Malcolm X,"" but that wasn't Pacino's fault).Bo Goldman's 1992 screenplay builds on the first two works. Here, the old warrior plunges into his last wild foray into a world that was once his, bent on showing goody two-shoes what it's all about. The young caretaker finds himself overwhelmed and unable to break away. Beyond that, our young man has just landed, the Friday before the crazy weekend during which the film takes place, by bad luck and no fault of his own, he has landed in deep, career-threatening trouble back at school. So for both members of this mismatched pair, it is a last weekend of sorts -- and a time to consider the problems the other person is facing.The Italian versions of this story are very European -- touching, troubling, realistic. Life isn't always fair, and Italian cinema doesn't kid about that. There are many movie lovers who feel the Italian approach is artistically, intellectually, and morally superior (see several comments here for example). They decry the Hollywoodization of this poignant story. And what they say is absolutely correct. But it is also true that to Hollywoodize this story into a more positive direction yields more opportunity to develop the plot, and this, to an extent, we get in Scent of a Woman. It may be film school heresy to say this, but in some ways, the 1992 film is the better version, because it adds interplay and drama between the two characters. They both have to face the world. The new ground broken here isn't quite credible but it's interesting in the evolution of this tale. Maybe the story on which Scent of a Woman is based is one of those plots that will be retold and improved again and again. It seems too good to end here. May the next version be the best one yet.",Scent of a Woman

He is abrasive and vulnerable.As a matter of fact Pacino looks like a blind person in other movies since his eyes don't focus in any object or person. Frank Caliendo in his stand up "" All Over the Place"" makes a very funny impersonation of Pacino and how he never looks at the other actor's eyes.Don't get me wrong. I think Pacino had good movies, Serpico and other performances that I enjoyed but this movie got 7.8 either because people haven't seen the original or saw this one first and never realized that Gasman made this character real and probably inspired Pacino's performance.One good movie to appreciate Gasman's talent is "" The easy life"" (Il sorpasso in Italian) and he has many others that I don't remember the title but watched them in Havana and made a lasting impression until today.",Scent of a Woman

242,Deleauvive,He wants to blow his head out but he might as well blow yours first !,7,23 April 2006,"7 ? well 6.5 actually. An entertaining and funny movie about a blind and retired lieutenant who has a plan, and what a plan ! When a college student comes in to assist him for the week-end, he executes his project by picking up the boy to New York, and there he realises some of his dreams in his company, sleeping in the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, driving a Ferrari with his assistance, ... He quickly establishes a close relationship with Charlie Sims, but at the same time he challenges him, because his behaviour contrasts so much with what we expect from a blind man.On Charlie's side, we learn that he witnessed some stupid joke some that some of his pals made on the Dean and that he hesitates to tell what he saw or to shut his mouth.First the flaws : First may be Chris O'Donnell is an improbable mate for Al Pacino, he gives on the emotional level what he misses in character.Then, I don't feel that being such an intransigent and sometimes arrogant person is a real lesson in life and the much debated ending seems to indicate that the Lieutenant has high moral standards. Come on, I know it's only a movie but where have you seen a blind man so interested in women, cigars, and so on... To me it was often like Al Pacino playing his usual nervous and macho male just wearing black glasses, rather than the role of an humble and aging blind man, like the one we imagine living in the backyard of the ""Flinstones"" house (his niece's).The good : Al Pacino takes so much pleasure in his role, that we enjoy the improbable situations, and that even makes us understand somehow his nasty playing with Charlie's nerves.All the fuss about the joke in the College yard may be an excuse for the Lieutenant to get involve in the process and make his radical but brilliant speech in front of the Disciplinary Comitee. Well, that's OK for me, but my advice is to focus on the moving moments of the interplay between him and the student, and of course all the amusing tricks he pulls and the surprises he creates, and yes, he must be a great Tango dancer in real life too.",Scent of a Woman

There's the old war veteran who suffers from what you'd call geriatric depression. And then there's Charlie, a young and just chap who is there to offer his young expertise.Interesting how many different perspectives the film presents. Justice, friendship, glory and suicide are no strangers to this film. Myriad different themes, yet what remains is a lovely, simple piece of the film industry.Al Pacino thrives as the likeable but somewhat conceited Lieutenant Colonel Slade who acts as a father figure to the young prep student. Chris O'Donnell perfectly captures the nature of young and sweet Charlie who doesn't always know what's what. They complement each other well and learn valuable lessons from one another.A lovely outlook on life and friendship in its many forms. Would most definitely recommend to watch.

247,hcandersonliu,Al Pacino at his best!,7,5 May 2002,"""The Godfather"" series, ""Carlito's Way"", ""The Dog Day Afternoon""... surely Al has always been known for those famous films and roles. However, of all his works, even though I am not an Al Pacino fan, I would raise both my thumbs for this work, which he won Academy Award for - Scent of a Woman. A truly heartwarming story with marvelous acting, righteousness and friendship. The speech at the end of thie film is most enjoyable and meaningful! I am especially touched when he said ""Integrity, courage, are the stuff leaders should be made of"" and felt his strong courage and a heart for truth when he criticizes Mr. Trask and the meeting. Yes, he's blind. But he sees much clearly than anyone does; yes, he may seem violent, but through conflicts and togetherness with Charles Simms, their friendship reveals. Like Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, Al succesfully interpret a blind man and his heart for righteousness and his friend Charles Simms.
However, there is something I don't understand. The story doesn't seem to have to do with the title. But the greatness about this film is not to be doubted and questioned. This is Al Pacino's best work!",Scent of a Woman

The bonding of Chris O'Donnell firm performance makes this movie an unforgettable classic.I can't forget the timeless quote that I stuck to in the movie: ""Hoo-ha!""

It's a movie that grows on you, and teaches you something new everytime to watch it.  Al Pacino is absolutely stunning, in the best performance of his career, and though he had never won an Oscar before he made this movie, the Oscar he receieved for his performance was well worth it. It is impossible to tell anything about the storyline without really giving away the story.  All that can be said is that the end is one of the best testaments to hope ever made for a motion picture, even though it isn't the ending that is expected. The language does get a little tiring though, and there are parts where the language is just crude, but if it is possible to look past that, the movie is a wonderful testament to what the human spirit can do.

256,Tenenbaum21,Al Pacino's and Chris O'Donnell's best film.,10,22 September 2002,"Scent Of A Woman is an extremely different film than we have ever seen in film cinema before. It tells the story of a ""town drunk"" who is blind and also had a great service in the United States. Al Pacino plays the blind man and Chris O'Donnell plays the part of Charley, who is hired to take care of Pacino for a weekend. I found this film humorous in some areas because of the way Pacino's character acts. Al Pacino has never played a character like this before and he executed the part very well! Pacino's eyes are always pointed in the opposite direction he would be looking if he weren't blind, which is brilliant. Scent Of A Woman's mood and setting made this film enchanting in a sense. It took place in a white and gray sky Autumn mood during Thanksgiving weekend. O'Donnell attends an Ivy League school and may or may not have witnessed a scheme that took place that involved humiliating a teacher in front of many students. Pacino's character is more complex than anything else and his character still holds a United States Military mood. Pacino constructs a list of things he wants to do and at the bottom of the list is killing himself. Scent Of A Woman did well at the Academy Awards, FINALLY giving Al Pacino an Oscar. I was very thankful for the ""Academy"" awarding Pacino an Oscar, but he should have received one a long time ago for The Godfather, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, or Glengarry Glen Ross. Hopefully he will receive another one later on in his career. However, it did not recognize Chris O'Donnell for his fantastic acting in this film, which disappointed me very much. This movie is somewhat emotional as well. I would recommend that you rent this film during Thanksgiving or in the fall. Scent Of A Woman was a very unique,entertaining, wonderful film.",Scent of a Woman

258,ruxandrasilvia,Al Pacino is splendid,10,10 May 2012,"Few characters in cinema history are so well defined, so memorable and fascinating as Col. Frank Slade, miraculously played by Al Pacino. Slade broke my heart, I'm not ashamed to admit it. I hate ""three-hankys"" and overly sentimental ""chick flicks"", so I kept avoiding ""Scent of a Woman"". When I've finally watched it recently, it didn't strike me as a ""chick flick"" though. Pacino's performance really moved me. He never lets the story slip into cheap sentimentalism, because his character is heart-wrenchingly real.C. O'Donnel is bland and uninteresting, but that's the way it was meant for his character to be. He's only a catalyst for Slade, a blank book waiting to be written. After all, he's just a 17 year-old. I love it when Hollywood is sending out a positive, moral message, even if the delivery is flawed. The ending of ""Scent of a Woman"" kinda spoils the story's realism, but nothing can diminish Pacino's brilliant performance.",Scent of a Woman

An acting to be thought and maybe repeated (or should we say, imitated?) at drama schools for eternity.
P.S.: I'm still trying to decide if I'll give it a 10 or 9. For now I'm sticking with 9 to possibily elevate it to 10 when I see the movie again at a later age. There were just a thing or two that I couldn't fully grasp with the Lt Colonel, which I think I will in time.",Scent of a Woman

The other message is that no matter how bad things go, there is a glimmer of hope.The processing of messages takes place with a simple event cycle and as expected. While this slows down the flow of the movie, Pacino's Oscar-winning acting re-enacts the flow that is about to fall every second.When the film is viewed from an artistic point of view, it does not seem remarkable. Nevertheless, a catchy scene is formed with the birth of the tango scene and its continuation with ""Por una Cabeza"" by Carlos Gardel.With Al Pacino's excellent performance and simple but effective messages, ""Scent of a Woman"" is definitely a movie worth watching.",Scent of a Woman

Remember the Seinfeld episode where Mr. Bookman is the library cop who does a hilarious straight-face parody of a serious Jack Webb of Dragnet? Pacino's character is acted like a smart-ass Lt. Kojak doing a serious impersonation of Mr. Bookman. There were about ten times more ""hoo-haw"" belches from Pacino that the average viewer should have to endure.

272,movie-monster,A token gesture for Pacino.,6,22 May 2014,"Al Pacino is undoubtedly one of the finest actors of his generation and his performance as retired Army Colonel Frank Slade in Scent of a Woman, finally earned him his long overdue Academy Award for Best Actor, however, in my opinion, it is far from his greatest role, though it is certainly a memorable one.My problem with this film is that for me it's an example of Pacino's dominating screen presence preserving a movie that would otherwise have been mediocre at best. The basic premise of the film is fairly dull. A young prep student called Charlie takes a job aiding a blind, lonely, retired colonel over thanksgiving weekend. The weekend turns out to be considerably more eventful than he anticipated, with the Colonel taking him first class to New York for one final bourbon-soaked hurrah, before intending to end his own life. When they head out to the city I expected there to be some good and perhaps amusing scenes where these two completely mismatched characters, one bitter, world weary and cynical, the other innocent, and naive, really get at one another and, to be fair, there are a couple of excellent moments. The tango scene, in which the Colonel dances with a complete stranger, in a classy New York restaurant is truly captivating, and another where he and Charlie test drive a Ferrari around some Brooklyn back-streets is also entertaining, however if a blind man were to drive and drift a Ferrari at over 70mph in real life, there would likely be some very severe consequences. These moments are few and far between however, and with a runtime of 2 ½ hours, the film does begin to drag.Al Pacino has faced up to, and bettered, some outstanding actors in his career (think Johnny Depp in Donnie Brasco, or even De Niro in Heat), but casting him alongside Chris O'Donnell was a big mistake. It's the cinematic equivalent of feeding a lamb to a T-Rex. Pacino simply devours him in every scene; he literally walks all over him. O'Donnell's (non) performance as Charlie is just flat, bland, empty, clichéd and tepid to the point of irritation, and pretty much undermines everything good Pacino brings to the film.Visually, Pacino does an excellent impression of a blind man, to the point where many characters in the film understandably, and believably, don't even notice. Admittedly, he isn't given the best script to work with but he still manages a couple of excellent monologues, most notably in one of the final scenes of the film, which brings me on to another failing of this picture.The subplot, which involves Charlie facing expulsion, as a result of refusing to grass up his peers over a particularly spectacular prank involving the headmaster, just seemed trivial and insignificant, and completely undeserving of Pacino's glorious tirade about integrity, and 'facing the music' which should have really been a highlight of the film. You watch this scene, admire it, and realise there was far too little of it in the preceding 2 hours.In conclusion, had Pacino not received the Oscar for Best Actor at some point in his career it would have been a travesty and an outrage, it's just unfortunate he received it for this role. He was so much better as Michael Corleone in The Godfather, or as ex-con anti-hero Carlito Brigante in Carlito's Way, or even as the overbearing, scenery- chewing, crack snorting gangster icon Tony Montana in Scarface. These are the roles I remember him by, and more importantly, they are vastly superior pieces of Cinema. Scent of a Woman, by comparison, is a mess. The plot is uninspired and boring, the script weak, the characters stereotypical. I've often felt that Al Pacino has an uncanny ability to make poor films average, and average films brilliant, and the former is certainly the case here. The film Two for the Money is another great example of this. A film about sports bettors with Matthew McConaughey that would have certainly been diabolical, and possibly never even released, were it not for Pacino's participation. His somehow makes it watchable... perhaps even.......interesting. Those who are new to his work (I envy you); please watch the other great films I mentioned above, before resorting to this. Disregard the Oscar. His ability to draw you into a scene and light up a film, or even just one casual line of dialogue, makes him the greatest actor of his generation, and consequently, my favourite actor of all time. It's for this reason ONLY that I give this film the 6 stars that it probably doesn't deserve.",Scent of a Woman
273,ovidjus,Only this and nothing more,10,8 January 2013,"I rated other movies that were cinematically better with a lower rate. I believe that this film has some flaws, not to be denied.

Yes, that's right, makes you want to fight, against injustice, against cowardice, against...and that made me remember instantly about Mr. Smith goes to Washington. The supreme idealist, the child we should all be like.I feel this movie is one that should be somewhere in the universal patrimony of humanity because it contains and explains in one story all the themes of humanity, all our fears and ideals: death, idealism vs materialism, honesty, richness vs. poorness, the mysterious course of life, illness, frustration, war, child innocence, sincerity, vulgarity vs academy and I could go on with this...It seems to me that all acting was great, except maybe the principal of the school that looked like a cartoon character.

275,Billy the Kid,Al Pacino is excellent in this otherwise unremarkable film,7,12 February 2002,"For the most part, ""Scent of a Woman"" is standard Hollywood fare, featuring a ""heartwarming"" and ""uplifting"" story about personal growth, the strength of friendship, and the discovery that life really isn't so bad after all. The plot involves a young student (Chris O'Donnell), who agrees to watch over a blind and embittered ex-colonel (Al Pacino) for Thanksgiving weekend. He then goes on to teach the older man a few lessons about life, while learning just as much himself. If this sort of relationship sounds familiar, it is because it has been the subject of countless other films (think ""Finding Forrester,"" for instance). ""Scent of a Woman"" is at least partially redeemed by the presence a few memorable moments, such as the scenes involving the Tango and the Ferrari.What really sets this film apart, though, is Al Pacino's brilliant performance. Although he tends to overact on occasion (as in some of his other post-1970s films, such as ""Scarface""), he still manages to reveal the complexities of his character in a way that no other actor could have managed. While Chris O'Donnell and James Rebhorn are fine in their roles, it is Al Pacino who gives us a reason to watch this otherwise unremarkable film.",Scent of a Woman

""Scent of a Woman"" is very profound and full of beautiful scenes. For example when Al Pacino is dancing the tango with a gorgeous girl or driving Ferrari in the New York. The blind man needs a guide in life like a teenager needs support in his school. Amazing speech about a twisted reality where we live, where we must choose our destiny. This movie is truly worth watching and it will give you hope. It also gives me a strength to live on, not give up and just be myself. I love movies.

The story or the plot is simple. This movie goes its length not because of the story or the plot, but its acting and screen presence of Pacino. This movie tries to teach the viewers about life.

I liked the overall idea behind the story, but the plot itself left much to be desired. I felt the movie was way too long at 2 1/2 hours. It really dragged especially toward the end. Also, in my opinion it lacked sufficient character development particular with ""Charley"" (O'Donnell). I did not have a good sense of who he really was, what he was about, and why I should even care anyway. His character had very little depth and no personality save for a shy, timid student who is intimidated by the Colonel (Pacino). I did not see how their characters really complimented one another even with the well-written monologues delivered by Pacino. And Charley's storyline seemed dull and his plight insignificant. He witnesses a prank on the headmaster by some classmates and is conflicted on whether or not he should blab - so what?
All in all, I felt ""Scent of a Woman"" was rather overrated but Al Pacino fans should definitely check it out because he definitely delivered an Oscar-worthy performance in my opinion. Besides that, you're not missing much.",Scent of a Woman
283,quentin_breman,The good with the bad,7,25 November 2020,Probably the best performance from Al Pacino I've ever seen. A level of acting we rarely see these days.

285,alimoyeth,Classic!,10,24 June 2020,"Two lost souls, both with difficulties communicating with the people around them, finding and helping each other sounds like the foundation for a wonderful movie if done right. This film does it right. The story concerns the friendship between an old man & a young man. In order to make some extra money, a young scholarship student takes a job of caring for a colonel, a blind war veteran. Charlie wants to back out of the job as soon as he meets the cantankerous man, but he's too nice to say no. Charlie's life-changing adventure begins when the irritable, outspoken, whiskey-guzzling colonel drags him to New York City for a weekend of indulgences, before blowing his brains out!This movie provokes a lot of strong emotions. It is a film that truly focuses on the hidden pains and conflicts within the characters mind. It also shows the harsh reality of our current education system and how it discourages instead of encourages the growth of a character and morality in youths. This movie also has the ability to make you think about life and how you should live to it's fullest.Al Pacino, being one of my favorite actors, is one of the reasons I loved this movie. This film is one of the reasons why Al Pacino is bad-ass. His performance moves mountains. In this film, he just blows you away, trust me. He was on his top form back at that time.

The basic scenario was good and would have made a great believable story but Pacino's regular philosophical diatribes started getting on my nerves after a while. Not 20 minutes before the end of the movie I told my wife that I just couldn't take any more so I went to bed, not even caring how the story ended.

290,lilsuburbboy,Two Too Contrasting Personalities,7,6 June 2004,"Scent of a Woman is a movie that aims to please all audiences. On the one hand, it satisfies those seeking meaning and heart in a movie, yet on the other, it provides off-kilter humor from a known rough and tough actor, Al Pacino (Godfathers, Devil's Advocate). This film is the tale of a weekend spent between a crass, retired Lt. Col. (Pacino) who because of his individualism and disregard for personal safety was rendered blind late in his life, and a poor and timid prep high school student in O'Donnell, who agrees to ""babysit"" the retired war hero over Thanksgiving weekend. What Charlie (O'Donnell) doesn't know is that the colonel has planned a rambunctious trip which is set to end rather abruptly. The movie contains funny scenes with a blind Pacino driving a Ferrari and dancing the tango.A subplot exists, where Charlie is grappling with a moral dilemma at school, where he battles between snitching out a classmate, or keeping his ""honor."" Predictably, Col. Slade gets involved and offers his two cents, which provides for an adequate finish, with a gut-wrenching and heartwarming performance by Pacino securing him his first Best Actor Oscar.Pacino's acting as a blind man, though not perfect, is sufficient given the circumstances in the movie. He offers up kindness and ""pearls of wisdom"" by barking out orders. Many who saw this movie, had expected a pure mushy drama, and for those who sought this sort of medium, were most likely disappointed. The movie displays great balance in each individual's character, and successfully strays away from either being too mushy, or too crass.Where the film lacks overall balance is in the performance by O'Donnell. I know director Martin Brest wanted to achieve a sense of Pacino's and O'Donnell's being opposites, but this was taken too far it seems. Charlie (O'Donnell) releases too many ""duhs"" and ""aaahs"" among other various verbal fumblings to make his character believable. And although he doesn't stand anywhere close to Pacino in the actor's pyramid, this film does not do him justice; because, as his fans know, he does obtain a few nuggets of good acting.Otherwise, the movie is funny, and even at times tear-jerking, long yes, but well worth it. As being one of the ""pioneering"" DVDs available to the public (released in such form in August of 1997), this DVD contains essentially no extras... but the film itself is a minor gem.",Scent of a Woman

And i believe such a point comes in everyone's life ,so its a movie for everyone .And the way Al Pacino played such a complicated character , you can easily identify with it and fall in love with it. 4. Chris O'Donnell and other actors did a fantastic job too. 5. the movie is very famous for its incredible dialogues and the ending speech that Al Pacino delivers to the committee which is one of my favorite part too. now ,comes the hard part ,why you shouldn't watch this movie and probably the reasons why critics did not like this movie: 1.the story and the fact that a blind retired colonel took a 17 yr old boy on a surprise trip to New York against his interest uses him as a guide , might not sound convincing and reality related to some people(critics i mean). 2.the way Charlie( Chris O'Donnell ) convinced colonel frank(Al Pacino) to not kill himself was not good enough .That i felt too and completely agree with the disappointment of critics.

Sometimes the seeing are more blind than those who really are...Charlie just happens to open up his eyes a bit more than many of the colonel's family members.

Pacino's lectures on the beauty of women, an incredible tango sequence with the beautiful Gabrielle Anwar, and a painful but humorous intra-family fight over Thanksgiving dinner are just a few of the great scenes this movie has to offer.

While the film was long, I didn't want it to end. The school ""trial"" allowed Pacino to give another sterling performance. I found myself even applauding the chauffeur for his limited performance.

This is a touching story of two people from different background and how they discover a new life after sharing few days together. Al Pacino gives best performance as blind Ret. Lt. Col. Frank Slade. After watching the movie I thought about the character played by Pacino and it really created an long lasting impact on my mind by its attitude , voice , dialogues and specially the way he does ""Who-ah"" I think no one else could have played this role as excellent as he did. Along with Pacino you get to see a good supportive performance by Chris O'Donnell who plays a young bright student in prep school, who is going through difficult phase about making certain decision in his life. The ""Tango girl"" Donna played by Gabrielle Anwar looks gorgeous and sweet in the small role. Also I did notice George Willis Jr. portrayed good by Phillip S. Hoffman in his early days.

The character of a retired colonel, who's still able to control everybody around him despite his blindness, is played in such a manner, I almost saluted every time he got focus on screen. But the most wonderful moments are the few on the dance floor. The scene of Frank(Al) and Donna(Gabrielle) doesn't get out of my thoughts. From the moment he catches her perfume, through the introduction, till the sweetest tango dance I can remember. Of course, the choice for Donna - Gabrielle Anwar, is perfect, she plays the shy (very) pretty woman very good.The only slightly tiny bad thing here is Simms's (Chris O'Donnell) part.

310,rshrawat,Al Pacino at his best,8,10 November 2012,"Al Pacino couldn't have asked for a better role than this and he couldn't have done more justice to it. A blind retired eccentric US Lt. colonel with all the wisdom in the world but an unproductive mindset. This movie takes you through a journey that Lt. Colonel Frank Slade takes with young Charlie (who's 'babysitting' him for the weekend) for a couple of days in New York; much to Charlie's disapproval, but without a choice. As Charlie develops a bond with the handicapped ex-army man, he discovers how entertaining, wise and interestingly instinctive Frank is, but at the same time overtly dominating, stubborn and frustrating to deal with. Charlie senses early on that something is constantly eating away at Frank from the inside and the money that Frank is splurging on a hired limo, expensive wines and hotels is just akin to a final list of 'things to do before you die'. Impossible to get along with, it was only something decisive that could make Frank appreciate the gem of a person Charlie was. That defining moment came when blind Frank, finally fed up of 'living in the dark' turns suicidal, but Charlie refuses to let him kill himself, even putting his own life on the line. What stood out in this scene was how Charlie finally refuses to be 'dismissed' as always by Frank and in an innocent and immature way (young as he is) stands up to Frank for the first time for the blind colonel's own good.But the best is saved for the last, when Frank realising that Charlie pulled him out of the dark, stands by him in Charlie's potentially career-derailing disciplinary committee at his school. Al Pacino delivers one of the best speeches in the history of cinema in this scene. His unconventional but highly moving and firm monologue directed to the headmaster attacks the deep-lying principles the school is built upon and the fallacy in its path of creating leaders for the future and preparing the students for manhood.This is a movie that does not depend on a brilliant plot ( some parts are predictable and could have been shortened), but thrives on a powerful ending and a breathtaking Academy Award winning ""Hoo-Ha!"" performance by Al Pacino !",Scent of a Woman

But what if soldiers rape and murder innocent civilians (hullo, it has happened as has even worse); does loyalty trump morality? The film says it does. One line Pacino says during his A FEW GOOD MEN speech was muffled and it may be, ""Some cornball crap"" or something like that. In that case, I rescind what I wrote. If he said that, then he realized that what he said was bs and it's all a stupid game.Also, the fluctuations in Pacino's accent are unnerving.

In the movie, Al Pacino is a blind man who at first, looks like a stubborn man who seem to dislike everyone and everything around him. It was until the trip he had with Charlie that he showed his true self. He may look ignorant and arrogant on the outside but on the inside, he is one who stands by his principles and what he thinks is right, as seen in the movie when he stood up for Charlie against the majority of the school. Another scene that moved me in the movie is his sense of smell. Perhaps due to his loss of vision, he is able to pick up scents easily - especially that of women fragrance. The scene that he danced with the woman in the restaurant left a deep impression within me because of how he seemed to have given hope to a woman he barely knows, by dancing with her a dance that she's longed to learn, in a space he doesn't know. Their dance was beautiful, and I'm sure that in the show, that was a turning point for that woman.

Pacino is undoubtedly one of the finest American screen actors of any generation, let alone his own, which is why his performance in this picture is an entirely frustrating experience. Why was is necessary for Pacino to shout every last word? The man is intimidating enough without him having to burst your ear drums.

Yes, the character was intended to come across as overbearing... but why at the risk of serious and lasting damage to the viewer?How could this character, who could dance a perfect Tango, drive a Ferrari, dismantle a hand-gun and repeatedly pre-empt and outwit the actions of all supporting characters despite his blindness, manage to make pouring a whiskey such a difficult task? Do we really need to be reminded that this man can't see in such an obvious way? Apparently we are incapable of remembering this for more than five minutes, so continuous are his fumblings! During many scenes I felt manipulated, I could feel the director tugging at my feelings rather than gently manipulating them or moulding them beyond my awareness. Especially when Al visits his brother and receives abuse from his nephew, who displays such contempt and wicked spitefulness, that your forced to begin your transition from loathing to empathising with him. On a plus, note the film was beautifully captured, especially the scenes in and around New Hampshire. Its just shame that the undoubted quality of the cast and crew could not shine through, blinded as they were by Pacino's attempts to deafen.",Scent of a Woman

This is definitely one of those films that has the ability to push and pull your emotions in so many directions during the course of the film, at least thats how I felt.  Chris O'Donnell is perfectly cast as Charlie, a quiet, underpriveledged yet intelligent young man who was awarded a scholarship at Baird.  He takes up the offer of a job looking after Lt Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) left blind after a party trick involving a hand grenade and alcohol went wrong.  The job is simple, to look after the Lt while his family go away for thanksgiving, sounds easy well this is where the fun starts.  No sooner have the family gone, Frank announces his plan to go away for the weekend and Charlie is along for the ride.From here the fun really starts as Charlies ""education"" in life begins and Franks intentions become clear.  I can't really say too much without spoiling the film but I can say it involves The Tango, fine food, fine wine, a one way ticket and a loaded 45.All in all a wonderful film with great acting and a great script, this is definitely Al Pacino at his best, Hoo Hah.",Scent of a Woman

Pacino gives Slade authority, humour, stuborness and a sense of class few could manage.O'Donnell pulls off the 'wet-behind-the-ears' role of Charlie Simms very well considering the presence of Pacino, giving the role exactly what it needed, somebody to take Pacino's crap and look completely out of his depth (the character not the actor).The scene in the hotel room where Slade tells Simms to pass him over a few bottles of that 'John Daniels' and Simms responds 'don't you mean Jack Daniels' the next line is my one of my favourite ever...'When you've known him as long as i have kid, you can call him John'Love the character, love the film, for once the Oscars got it right 1993s best actor in a leading role deserved it fully.",Scent of a Woman

Not because he's blind, but because he's never been able to rise above the blindness and still find peace with himself and with the world. One of the great tragic characters of recent years. His story is much like Hickey's in ""Iceman Cometh"" or Howard Beale's in ""Network."" They never think they do good in the world with what they have, so they find themselves in this dark hole and they stay there. No one can help them out. No one looks after them. No one feels what they feel. As years go on and opportunities are lost, the dark hole gets filled with a lot anger, sorrow and possibly regret. Can they be healed? Do they want to be healed? In ""Scent of a Woman,"" Pacino presents this dark, gloomy character perfectly in his Oscar winning performance. He overwhelms you with his constant bellowing and ordering of O'Donnell's Charlie. He's a man who never left the Military. My guess is that you can never take the military of out the man, only the man out of the military. He doesn't blame anyone or anything for his blindness.

Then when Pacino dances tango (NOT A SPOILER!), all hell breaks loose, all the magic is gone. O'donell, well, he plays the poor Irish boy. Kind of like in the Departed.

It's heartwarming, yet heartbreaking at the same time, all its contradictions are what makes it a great film.Frank Slade, the old, clumsy, self-centered, rude and blind man is a person we all know and have dealt with (perhaps he's not blind at all cases) and to see him on screen portrayed to absolute perfection was great to see. That complicated, philosophical man with the pessimistic view of life yet he can come up with stuff like ""No mistake in the tango, Donna, not like life. Simple. That what makes the tango so great. If you make a mistake, get all tangled up, just tango on!"". he couldn't be more right. And Charlie Simms, the awkward, timid young man that I suppose we can all identify with. The poor college student that feels threatened continuously due to his lack of ""support"". The support that he later gains. I saw in these two the father-son relationship that they both lacked and craved, they found it in each other. And because it was chosen by both of them, and wasn't inevitable, it was stronger and more truthful than any other father-son relationship. They absolutely loved each other. They looked tailor-made for each other, and they indeed were.And Al Pacino. What can you honestly say about him. One of the greatest actors ever. It came as a shock to me when I knew that he didn't win but one academy award. They should be given to him left right and center whether or not he makes a movie, that's how good he is! He absolutely executed the role to absolute perfection, in fact he ejaculated all over the role's Hoo-ah if you will! Frank Slade was a blind man. A blindness that he was compensated for by his remarkable sense of smell, he could indeed identify a woman's scent effortlessly in a blink of an eye.

His decision to snitch on them would save his place in school and his only motivation not to do it is to look ""integrous"" in eyes of other people, because he doesn't care about guilty. My first thought was about Charlie learning from colonel's strong character to make strong decisions, accepting circumstances you have no affect on (would be a good idea according to colonel's blindness, sometimes you just have to accept a situation, do what you need to and to move on). I think that a strong decision would be a leaving people you don't need behind, you'll never suit everyone, you need to choose by yourself what is important for you in exact situation and don't be afraid of what someone thinks about you.",Scent of a Woman

Enter Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a prep school student, with ambitions of going to university; ambitions that are on the verge of collapse when he is summoned to a disciplinary hearing for a prank that he was not part of. Charlie agrees to babysit Col.Slade for the weekend. Unbeknownst to him, the Colonel has grand plans of spending the weekend in New York; and he doesn't plan on returning. Col. Slade takes Charlie along and during the course of the weekend, both men learn a little bit more about life.This is probably not the best movie you will ever see, with the ending quite obvious and plenty of clichés thrown in. But if you watch it just for Al Pacino then you're not going to be disappointed. Pacino delivers another brilliant performance as the blind, retired Lt. Colonel with a brash exterior and a heart of gold, and he rightly won the Best Actor Oscar for this performance. It does make one wonder why he didn't win for his portrayals in other movies such as Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and The Godfather II where his performances were equally, if not more, powerful. Be that as it may, Pacino is riveting from his first scene to the last. Chris O'Donnell is nowhere near the class of Pacino, but to his credit, he tries hard and manages to deliver a fairly solid performance as the prep school student who is trying to decide on his course of action for the disciplinary hearing.The interaction between Frank and Charlie is very believable, and you can see that they're both teaching each other valuable lessons for their respective lives.There are some slightly far-fetched moments(Ferrari scene) but they are more than balanced out by moments of sheer beauty (tango scene).

These two people are both in their own dilemma. Blind retired lieutenant Frank knows how to live a good life but are unable to do it, so he prepared to kill himself after one last tasting of this delicious world( world of women, booze, cigar, dinner, tango and fararri). The other character is a naive, timid, poor prep school student who has to face the question: selling friends for his own future or close mouth to protect them. How these two people in great differences meet each other? The writer let the blind man' s sister offer a job of looking after him because she has to go home for Thanksgiving Day, and the teenager has to ""babysit"" the blind guy for money to go home. That is a coincidence in real life but a necessity in a movie.This movie was captured in 1992 so it is a little hard to understand for guys in my generation. The directer want to show a picture of black or white, integrity or immoral, energetic or depressed, but where we live now is more a grey world where the boundaries of standards and values are not that clear the way in the year the movie was made. But a good thing certainly exists some shining parts beyond time and space: Human natures and the ever-lasting conflicts come after that. Because of that people from all over the world, speaking various languages, living in ancient or modern times laugh or cry for a movie or a book. People feel what the character feels in his situation.So, what do you anticipate would happen when they met? They will fight and then shoot each other or they fall in love after experiencing so many things? No, they just compared with each other for a Thanksgiving weekend and supported each other to through their life crisis. The young preppy did two things to save the old suicidal man' life. One, in the boy's encouragement, the man found that what he need actually is a woman who understand and love with acceptance of his incapacity(she will wrapped me with her arms and legs, and until morning she still is there), but all his precious preoccupation of lust for women or forms of tasted high-end world is just a hypercorrection for his inferiority as a disable. Finding his merits and knowing what he really want keep him from suicide. Two, the integrity and morals the boy showed fill his hole in the heart and this become the power to support him in the rest of his life.( Though I do feel awkward for Frank' so called touching speech in Charlies's court.)In the same time, Frank with all of his great money, extraordinary taste of the VIP class, and mature values of this world, not only help this little naive youngster out of his dilemma, but also gave him a memorable lesson in his life.Forget to say, this old man is childless and the younger has a stepfather whom he doesn't get alone with very well. In the short but profound two days' company, they fulfilled what each other's missed- (the father-son relationship).

I feel this movie moves along with the person watching it...today, tomorrow...and so on, and so on...",Scent of a Woman
364,falcon50c,Maybe the greatest performance of all time.,10,16 September 2002,This movie is far and away my favorite of all time. I've watched it practically once a week for the last 5 years and it keeps getting better. Pacino's performance is maybe the greatest i've seen and anyone who gives this movie less than a 9 should watch it again and realize the error in their ways.,Scent of a Woman
365,Srbo,A beautiful film,8,18 February 2009,"Truly amazing acting by Al Pacino and a long overdue Oscar finally received. Also, O'Donell had a very fine performance. It is incredibly hard to act like Al did, specifically given his condition, but he did a master work in my opinion. Truly recommended for everyone. A masterpiece. Kudos to the director as well. And some scenes, like the dancing are just amazing. The passport to heaven, he says. Isn't that a wonderful statement? I wish there were more films like this made. And a great comeback for Al. If he had to come back from anything, that is. Movies like this are pure inspiration. To fight. And never give up. And thats what Al did. He never gave up.",Scent of a Woman
366,fungicord,A terrible movie with pretty good acting.,2,6 September 2002,"I went into this movie with a completely open mind.  I never saw any previews and didn't know what it was about.  It was terrible.  I was shocked to find out that this movie was a remake.  I can't believe anyone would make it the first time, let alone copy the script.  The plot is boring as can be. The character of Charlie is unrealistically naive.  The star actors deliver great performances, so if you're in the business of hiring actors, this would be good to watch.  The movie isn't tear-jerking or exciting.  It doesn't offer suspense or substantial drama.  I never connected with any of the characters to either cheer for them or hate them.  It's the telling of a dreary tale about building character.  This movie is for die-hard Pacino fans only.",Scent of a Woman
367,cristina-mosneag,Al Pacino - one of his best performances,10,15 February 2011,"I am fascinated with Al Pacino in this movie, although he is my favorite actor of all times, he can always surprise me more. From my point of view this movie is perfect: I love the actors, Chris O'Donnell is great, the dialogs, New York, the guys at the prestigious school. I first saw this film a few years ago, but from time to time I feel the need to see it again, it is very close to my heart. What I enjoy most in the story is the connection between Colonel Frank Slade and Charlie, how it develops along the 2 days. I think Chris O'Donnell had a very difficult part, to act such a shy guy and in the same time a good guide and a life savior for Frank. Al Pacino is making one of his legendary roles (along Michael Corleone,Sony or Tony Montana), you just can feel his passion, his pain, his regrets. So, go and see the movie, you will have a great experience! :)",Scent of a Woman
368,gidtkatly,Fantastic film,9,22 May 2010,"When people think of Al Pacino, his role in the magnificent Godfather series is the first that comes to mind. I must admit that I always believed that his Oscar reward was actually given to him for that series. As it turned out, I was wrong. Pacino's acting in ""Scent of a Woman"" is in my belief his all-time best. Playing the role of a blind person seems hard enough- but he plays as though he's actually blind. While that alone may not be too hard, what makes his performance outstanding is, as always, his acting in the dramatic scenes. While Pacino's acting is what makes this movie ""work"", other factors help as well. The screenwriter did a terrific job, making what seems to be an instant classic. The dialogs are occasionally hilarious, mostly due to the lead character dry wits. To sum things up, this is a fantastic film. There's at least one classic scene here, but I'll not even hint at it due to fears of spoilers.",Scent of a Woman

Al deserve this Oscar. His performance was the best for 1992 and one of the best of all time. Colonel Slade showed to us the destination from a man with no hope to a man with power and courage. We agree that this happens to everyone in his whole life. Everyone through centuries will know who is the legend Al Pacino and remember his performance in ''Scent of a Woman''.

I'm saying this because I'm not much of a drama watcher. I mean, drama is all about drama. Most of the time it's pretty boring. No feel, excitement, or passion inside.But this movie here, is entirely different. It brings the actual drama meaning and its capability to amaze audiences. We won't be forced to decide who's the good guy or the bad guy in the end. It's just a simple story which I'm sure happen around us all the time.There is school, student, blind old man (not your average blind old man though), women (this, we never got bored), part time job, conflict in the family and school. Imagine all of those things combine.Even if you're not much of a drama fans, I'll suggest you to watch it.

The Character Charles Sims, played by Chris O'Donnel was also another character that caught my attention as well, to be able to question the decision in which he must make, a decision in which you think; ""What would i do in his shoe's?""

Powerful dialogues and outstandingly delivered by Al-pacino. He won Oscar for that and he deserved. THE STORY IS NOT EXTRA-ORDINARY BUT AL-PACINO'S PERFORMANCE MADE IT Lovable MOVIE.

375,ladyonyekonwu,Scent OF A WOman,10,29 April 2011,"Al Pacino (Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade) is a retired from the US army. He's blind and mad at the world, making him hard to get along with. Chris O'Donnell (Charlie Simms) is a boy from Oregon who attends Baird School which is a boys boarding school. Charlie is not wealthy like most of his peers; he is there on a scholarship. Charlie and his friend Baxter Harris (George Willis Sr.) witness a couple peers setting up a prank on the head principal James Robinson (Mr. Trask) who finds out that they can identify who did the prank. Neither Charlie nor George is willing to tell him who the peers are. He gives both of them until after Thanksgiving to decide what they will do because, if they do not talk, they will have other consequences to deal with. Charlie is faced with a bribe from Mr. Trask that could make it possible for him to attend an Ivy League College. For Charlie, it is a struggle between standing up for what is right or doing what is best for his future. While dealing with all of that drama, he needs to make some money so that he can help pay for a trip home for Christmas. He does a brief interview with Gabrielle Anwar (Donna) who is Frank's niece. He agrees to look after Frank over Thanksgiving. When taking the job, he is not aware of the trip to New You with Frank and his agenda while they are there. While in New York, Charlie make a couple calls to George and finds out the type of friend he really is. Once again, Charlie is faced with some really difficult decisions that are a matter of life and death. Charlie and Frank are two extraordinary actors in the film, ""Scent of a Woman."" They are a perfect pair, one who has always stood firmly for what he believes in and the other one who is learning how to do just that. The prep school setting, and Charlie learning to stand up for what he believe is a cut out of one of the prep school movies. Like, in the movie, ""Dead Poet Society,"" there is the coming of age and learning to stand up for what is believed. I feel that the lighting contributed to the film. There was a mixture of high and low key lighting throughout the film. The direction of the lighting that was used in the film only added to the images. There was the use of natural lighting and artificial lighting. The lighting emphasized the characters and suggest some of their inner qualities.",Scent of a Woman

But there is this movie which stir you from inside, makes you emotional, makes you one with the character of Colonel. Probably the best acting performance I have watched by far. Al Pacino is now my all time favourite. He just single handedly drives the whole movie with his sheer and brilliant. Oscar was much better to wait for such a long time to grant him his best acting award. And that sarcastic and ironical at the same time hoo--ha specially when he was abused in the Thanksgiving and at the final scene when the committee excused the boy can just blow anyone away.

378,Cinema_Lover_Egypt,A Great Actor,9,20 February 2004,This is a fantastic movie which shows the life of many people in the world who are blind and try to end their lives.

379,poppyzp,"If you're tangled up, just tangle on. -- Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade",9,13 May 2012,"Having watched Scent of a Woman for a second time, I'm still impressed by the final speech made by Al Pacino, who played the blind Colonel Frank Slade. Frank Slade is a retired lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. army. He lost his eyesight to some stupidities a few years ago as he became cranky and gruff. Although he can't see, he really got a gift in telling the perfume of women's. Chalie Simms played by Chris O' Donnel is a prep school student who comes to Slade's house to earn some extras by ""babysitting"" him. Slade then takes Charlie to New York city where he plans to kill himself after fulfilling his last few wishes. Hence their adventure begins.Basically, it's a two-man movie centered on Colonel Slade and preppy Charlie. But the two really did a great job in the movie, especially the acting of Al Pacino as Colonel Slade. Al Pacino's interpretation of the cranky but perceptive blind Colonel is totally believable. He looks as natural as a blind man in the movie, and he draws a fine line between well-performing to overacting. People grows on the gruff Colonel quickly, and personally, all that left to me at the end of the movie is an original, funny and respectful man that I wish to make friends with.There are also some funny lines in the movie and Colonel Slade's words are always thought-provoking especially the final speech!! Needless to say, Al Pacino's Oscar of Best Actor is well-deserved for his excellent performance in this movie. Hoo-ha, thumbs up.",Scent of a Woman

On the surface, Scent of a Woman is a cult classic about a blind man (Frank) who has lost all hope in his life and plans to kill himself but only after fulfilling his last few dreams. The story comes to life when a student Charlie visits Frank seeking a winter job and the voyage they together overtook after that.Al Pacino, a prolific actor, once again gives a commanding performance in this captivating movie with witticism embedded in his serious demeanor and was aptly assisted by Charlie. Both had their own set of problems and were in a dilemma whether to stand their ground or run for cover and give up.The crux of the movie comes at the end (apart from the scene where Charlie saves Frank from killing himself), when Charlie was about to be fired from his B-School on the ground of not being an informer to his Dean, Frank takes the center-stage and gives a scintillating speech which astounded not only the audience inside the scene but outside it as well and the stand out performance of Al Pacino helped him in winning many prestigious awards.The movie emphasize on the integrity and courage a man must possess in order to be leader and he should walk the path of principles and character only if his soul is non-negotiable.",Scent of a Woman
381,texasrosecafe,Ocar performance by Pacino almost ruined by excruciatingly insipid Hollywood ending. [SPOILER],7,26 July 2004,"[ ** spoilers follow **]This movie is about the Pacino character, and especially the tango scene. It is intense, dark, and will resonate with the 30+ crowd. The movies should end when the kid talks Pacino down, and perhaps could have been at least nominated for P's incredible performance. Until then, the whole cynical-wisdom meets wide-eyed idealism is poignant and bittersweet and works. Then there's the absurd, tacked-on ending which you may inspire you if you're under 20 and in school, but coming after the rest of the movie and all the work they did building up P's exquisitely noble-tragic-raunchy character it is painfully sophomoric and trite. In short, by the time you're been through these intense scenes and dialog (tango, Ferrari, the ""two syllables"" monologue, and the attempted suicide) you couldn't give a rats *ss about whether the kid gets expelled from school and the hyperbolic, trite, cheesy, gratuitous last scene.

You know I used to believe that to know someone you should listen to their silence rather than their words; it's scientific! You see Light is much faster than sound, so to see things for what they really are you should abandon all your senses but the sight. I admit sometimes you hear someone talk and change your mind about the whole idea...The movie reminds me the few times in life when you find yourself standing at a precipice of a decision.

Personally I really like it, since it visualizes the essence of sensuality in an otherwise gruff and arrogant man. Many may miss the fact that Pacino plays a man (Frank) who loved life and the beauty that is woman, but has had most of it denied to him through his blindness. While the boy, Charlie, is not visually impaired, he IS blind to what Frank can see, until he learns to see with his heart, mind and all of his senses.

388,shattered_looking_glass,Depression and John Daniels,7,22 September 2005,"A captivating illustration of major depression in action, Scent of a Woman follows one man's last journey through his favorite pleasures in life. It is apparent upon introduction that Frank is not a man content with his situation, but the complexity of his anger makes it difficult to separate personality characteristics from actual symptoms of depression. While alcohol abuse is not a necessary component for depression, it accompanies it well if the individual is looking for a way to distance himself from emotions or thoughts. Indeed, Frank seems to consider Jack Daniels to be his only worthwhile companion. His favorite drink receives more respect than most of his family; even the pet name John is an indication of just how familiar alcohol has become to Frank. ""He may be Jack to you son, but when you've known him as long as I have"" is supposed to be a joke, but the truth behind his humor is hard to deny. We are watching a man drink himself into a state of consciousness that he's come to regard as suitably bearable. Any more, he could not function well enough to carry out his plans. Any less and he wouldn't be able to cope with what those plans are really about. The general lack of interest in typical social activities is common in people suffering from depression. In Frank's case it is juxtaposed with his incredible effort to squelch those true emotions with grandiosity and excessive indulgence. While seemingly excited about his grand plan for a last whoo-ah, Frank is very disconnected from his surroundings at home. Impatient with his niece and nephew, and highly critical of his caregivers, Frank makes a point of interacting a little as possible with his family. Indeed part of his aggressive and abusive behavior towards Charlie is an attempt to drive him away. ""You back?"" Frank says after sensing Charlie has returned a second time. Frank seems impressed to have found someone that would choose to put up with him, even if it is only for the $300. Upon their arrival in New York, it would seem that Frank has lightened up, even found enjoyment. But for all his lavish expenditures, the pleasure is always fleeting and never fully alleviates his sadness, his sense of worthlessness. The days always end the same, with Frank's face fading from a smile into the familiar dull pain and deep loneliness. Overall, this film does an adequate job of portraying major depression but makes it difficult to distinguish characteristics of Frank's personality from concrete symptoms. While anger, tenacity, and fierce independence shape our view of this tragically self-flawed character, they are not offered as a means of explaining his deep depression away. To the contrary, they are the very reasons we are able to see clearly Frank's seemingly lost battle to find a sense of self-worth, to recall the joys of living.",Scent of a Woman

First we get an inside look at an old military man about to make a last farewell in a most extravagant way. (This is Mr. Pacino at his best.) We see his disdain for the ""green"" cadet and his ignorance of the military core values such as honor. We see his compassion for the boy and his attempts to instill in this civilian those deeply rooted values.We also see the same story from the perspective of the young cadet, who begins the film as a rather naive boy but by the end of the movie, has shown he does possess those character traits valued by military men of honor.As the story progresses, we see that the hard shell of the military man hides a very soft inner persona, one who is completely hidden from plain view. You feel a certain sympathy for this blind person once you meet him but by the end of the movie, you no longer feel sympathy, but instead an understanding of his perspective based on critical events in his past.All in all, a great story well told.

The most prominent one is, of course, Al Pacino's Col. Frank Slade - a man blinded by his irresponsibility a few decades before the film even starts, coping with his pain using alcohol and obscene, foul language. Although the actor's manner of speech is rather annoying, he makes up for that by acting just like a blind, rugged war veteran would. The supporting cast is great as well - especially Seymour Hoffman, who, as he usually does, steals every scrap of screentime given to him. The cinematography and music are rather bland, but they fit the film well enough to not be off-putting. I didn't really like the main character, though - maybe it was because he was nearly always with Hoffman or Pacino, but I don't really remember him being either interesting or well-acted.To summarize, ""Scent of a Woman"" is a nice film, and it utilizes it's 2,5 hour runtime rather well, although after 25 years it seems filled to the brim with cliches.

400,El_Chinito,"Scent of A Woman, Stinker of A Movie",1,23 January 2007,"The Scent of A Woman is a turgid, tedious and wholly predictable piece of formula hack work. Al Pacino gives a masterclass in overacting, while never for a second convincing as a blind man. His accent veers all over the southern United States, and he's in practically every scene in a movie that's easily 45 minutes longer than it should be. Worse, we're meant to believe that he can accurately guess an airline stewardess's name simply from her accent and her perfume. Please.As for Chris O'Donnell, his character Charlie is so nauseatingly anemic, naive and goody- goody that you just want to slap him. Pacino shouts and barks incessantly and interjects 'Hoo-hah!' at the end of O'Donnell's lines throughout. Really, the sheer egotism on display here is staggering: Pacino clearly believes that not only is his obnoxious characterization credible, but that he's also witty, charming and ultimately lovable for his fierce pride, patriotism and independence. The few attempts at humor are toe-curling in their ineptitude. At one point he tells O'Donnell to call room service and order 'a large John Daniels on the rocks'. When O'Donnell says, 'Don't you mean Jack Daniels?' Pacino responds, 'When you've known him as long as me, you call him John... That's a joke.' (Well Al, technically it's not, because a joke is a witty rejoinder that stands some chance of making you laugh.)In fact, Pacino's overbearing, scenery-chewing cartoon character invokes nothing but irritation and revulsion. That he won a Best Actor Oscar for this role demeans every other Oscar winning actor in history. That's how goddamn awful this movie really is. A turd, there's no other word for it.",Scent of a Woman

It is always something deserving to keep and fight, something called principle. just be the man you should be, and do the right things. this is the second time i watch this movie, it's actually another kind of feeling. the colonel , behalf of the old and rotten person, with Chile, and young principle man, are a interesting association. and the performance of the gold father really shocked me.",Scent of a Woman
403,EnglishWT,Scent of a what?,2,5 February 2018,"I've been taking notes on the ""rare"" sexist scenes of the movie - turns out I now have notes on the whole damn film. Sure, the movie is one of its kind - it touches upon almost every aspect from the characters, plot, scene and lines to meticulously illustrate the story of a misanthropic, sexist, alcoholic fogey who takes a young student (who he'd just met) for his final days of debauchery before planning a poorly executed suicide in a luxury hotel room - and fails. Wait, what?I won't ignore the only good part of the film - Al Pacino's acting. Declared a masterpiece himself, Al Pacino succeeds in giving his character, Frank Slade a poorly deserved breath of life (he honestly shouldn't have). In fact, Al Pacino's acting is so exceptional that Chris O'Donnell (Charlie Simms) might as well have been replaced by a walking stick to whom Pacino can give his womanizer advices to whenever he wishes. At least then would he influence, with his biased opinion, an object not a growing child. Spoilers from here*The movie feels desperate, trying to connect me to Frank Slade's companionship with O'Donnell. In the process, I'm disgusted by their ""man to man"" conversations about women. Women are literally a device in the movie - an object that is lovely, smells good and is physically pleasing, a way for him to be happy in his old and helpless age.General Slade and Charlie's conversation on the plane says it all - ""Women, who made em? God must've been a fu**ing genius."" To this moment I'm screaming internally of this portrayal of women as a man-made object. In fact, women made you, so maybe you shouldn't talk about their ""Tits"" or ""What's in between their legs,"" as a ""passport to heaven,"" Frank. And come on, we're really supposed to accept that he guesses an stewardess's name and features simply from her accent and scent? Just in case Frank Slade doesn't realize, the number of different women in the world doesn't correlate to the number of perfumes there are. And worse, I'm not sure how any of these lines take part in making meaning out of the movie. ANY.Hoo-ah, the infamous tango scene. First of all, why does he come up to the girl with Charlie and expects her to be pleased with Charlie's appearance? And second of all, if General Slade is there to help Charlie talk to the girl in the first place, why does he look more desperate to have a dance with her? Maybe I'm overthinking this scene, but with the conversation about ""pu**y"" and ""t*ts"" the scene before this, the tango feels as if the two (Charlie and Slade) already has come to a consensus that women are sex objects, making the dance seem lustful. Even without considering all of this, Frank Slade is clearly making an ""offer"" that the girl cannot decline. The lines considered beautiful in the film would be considered annoying and forceful in real life. I would be calling my assumptions an opinion until here, but when the film shows Frank asking his driver to call for him a sex worker, the ""finest of their kind,"" and later walks into the house to get his business as ""a man"" done, I am utterly, and horribly disgusted. It's very much solid evidence that the movie generalises women as sex objects and isolates them. Has anyone noticed that every time a female character appears on screen, Frank has something to say about them? If not, please never watch the movie ever again. Even with its film quality, scent of a woman never arouses an actual interest - the endless dialogues and Frank's loud presence bores me in the first hour. Crippling is its lack of rhythm, as the shots are linear in direction and the scenes are unnecessarily long and draining. The movie is highly predictable, and doesn't give many possible routes to where the story can go. Even the most important, climax of the film is elongated with half the audience already knowing that Slade is not going to shoot himself (although the same half of the audience would have gladly done it for him). Moreover, the movie hardly shows any efforts to make its melodrama interesting, not showing any emotional connections between the main protagonists. It turns out to be more counter-productive in its portrayal of sincerity as evident through its corny, happy ending. I guarantee you that you'll enjoy this movie as much as you love bumping into a sharp corner or punching yourself in the face. I'll introduce the film to my two sons, as a bible to what they should never say and do - although I doubt they would even want to. Romanticizing discrimination is not part of their interests. So If you're someone who is already a sexist, hard-headed, emotional excuse for a human being, sure, go watch the film. If not, go refresh yourself with a speech on equality and an actual ideal, educated world. Have fun!",Scent of a Woman

406,loridrum73,The original is much better,5,21 March 2006,"The original Italian movie featuring the greatest Vittorio Gassman and Paolo Villaggio, well, THAT IS a masterpiece of pure outstanding acting and screen writing. It is a great deal better than this poor American version. Why do second versions of anything in movie history are usually poor in some way, either wrong casting or direction..? There is always something lacking off somewhere. I repeat: if you have seen the original Italian one this US Scent of A Woman will be ridiculous to your eyes. Vision of the original Italian one is strongly recommended. You may have a hard time finding it though... Al Pacino delivers and he is believable, no doubt about it... but it is not enough and his co-fellow O'Donnel reaches level of weakness in his interpretation you would think his coat is actually more expressive than him. One last time: the Italian one is the one and only.",Scent of a Woman
