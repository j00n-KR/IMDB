0,TheLittleSongbird,Too many horror maniacs spoil the excessive froth,3,1 January 2018,"The idea to have two horror character icons, Freddy Krueger from the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' films and Jason Voorhees from the 'Friday the 13th' films, in the same film was an intriguing one and had a lot of potential to work. Unfortunately, 'Freddy vs. Jason' was an example of a film that executed this intriguing idea poorly and it really does not live up to its rather misleading title. 'Freddy vs. Jason' is not a complete disaster, then again this is coming from somebody who always tries to find something of worth in bad films. It has a visual eeriness (at times, when it's not looking like it was made on the cheap) and the music looms ominously and tries to give the film some kind of mood. The film also boasts one good performance, that of Robert Englund showing why Freddy's iconic status in the horror film genre is justified. When it comes to the acting stakes however, Englund is the only one who seemed to be trying. Ken Kirzinger never looks comfortable as Jason, which immediately dissipates any kind of menace. Regardless of how out of his depth Kirzinger was he is nothing compared to the dreadful, a very rare adjective for me these days when it comes to film critiquing, performances from everyone else, with a big dishonourable mention going to a catastrophically bad Kelly Rowland. Not that it is entirely their fault, though mostly it is. The characters that aren't Freddy and Jason are incredibly irritating and don't actually serve much point to the story other than having a subplot that induces unintentional laughter and feels really thrown in in a barely relevant way. Some of it is done to the writing and some of it is also to do with that the acting is as bad as it is. With its excessive froth, even more excessive cheese, stilted flow and over-reliance on clunky and useless exposition the dialogue is an embarrassment.'Freddy vs. Jason' even manages to foul up Freddy and Jason themselves. The myths, back-stories and development of both characters are muddled and ludicrous. There is a complete lack of scares, chills or suspense, thanks to pointless gore and a story that overdoses on daftness and relies far too much on the dreams within nightmares concept that was tired well before this film was made. Mostly it feels cheap and Ronny Yu's direction never rises above the half-hearted (most of the time he fails to reach even that). Overall, with an interesting idea going for it there was a decent film somewhere in 'Freddy vs. Jason'. It's just so frustrating that it turned out to be the mess that it is, with the huge (in number and size) flaws fighting the few good points every step of the way. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Freddy vs. Jason
1,Leofwine_draca,A gruesome cartoon put on film,7,19 July 2016,"Now there's a novel idea: pit two iconic horror movie villains against each other in a modern, up-to-date slasher movie (refreshingly free of the annoying self-awareness that ruined the films that followed Scream) and throw in tons of gore and violence to appease jaded audiences. The result? A jokey, reference-filled epic that will entertain fans of both sets of films. Although not exactly adding any new ground to the mythos generated by twenty-odd movies, this one goes back to the basics and has plenty of inventive dream sequences to recommend it. The plot is fairly full, too, with plenty of killing going on, with unpredictable victims for a change. The helmer is BRIDE OF CHUCKY's Ronny Yu, and he makes a damned good attempt at things.The teenage crowd that provides the focus of the film are the usual unknown bunch of intellectual bimbos, brainless jocks and topless starlets. Robert Englund returns, having a ball as a particularly vicious Freddy, although sadly Kane Hodder has been replaced by another hulking menace behind the hockey mask. The death sequences are frequent and extremely gruesome, with bodies cut in two, decapitations and impalings galore. Other deaths, like the fold-up bed scene, are particularly ingenious and raise schlocky gore to new, obscene levels. As for the scare factor, well Freddy is quite OTT this time, not particularly frightening (but was he ever, except in the very first film?) whilst Jason, as the immobile stalker, actually succeeds in terms of sheer menace – I loved the scenes of him stalking in the cornfield. The final showdown between the two movie monsters is well worth the wait, with extreme, cartoonish violence being the order of the day. Bring on the next in the series",Freddy vs. Jason
2,SnoopyStyle,clash of horror icons,5,24 June 2015,"Freddy Krueger is powerless without his children. He revives Jason Voorhees to go attack 1428 Elm Street. Lori Campbell (Monica Keena) lives there with her widowed father. She and her friends Kia (Kelly Rowland), Gibb (Katharine Isabelle), Trey, and Blake are attacked by Jason. Meanwhile Lori's ex-boyfriend Will (Jason Ritter) escapes from the mental hospital. He tells Lori that his father was the one who killed her mother and put him in the hospital. The teens joined by Charlie (Chris Marquette) and deputy Scott Stubbs (Lochlyn Munro) are individually slaughtered by both Freddy and Jason.I'm not sure what I was expecting from this killer mash-up. It doesn't start out well. It's yet another bunch of twenty somethings playing high school teens getting slaughter. Kelly Rowland is definitely a mistake. Jason Ritter's character and the father is too complicated. Of course, it still has the great Robert Englund acting up a villainy storm. It does what is probably the most important thing for horror fans. It gets the two icons in some good fights. For most other movie goers, this is rather boring exercise because none of the teen characters are actually interesting.",Freddy vs. Jason
3,claudio_carvalho,A Good Entertainment for Fans of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees,7,2 May 2004,"Freddy Krueger is very weak, since he has been forgotten in Elm Street for four years, having his records completely erased and hidden from the population. Freddy wakes Jason Voorhees up from the grave to terrify the population of the Elm Street and make them remember Freddy Krueger and make him stronger again. However, Jason does not stop killing the children of Freedy' and Freddy decides to fight against Jason and eliminate him. I am a great fan of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. This story is silly as most of the others, the dialogs are near ridiculous, but I found it very funny and a good entertainment for fans of these characters. There is not much to comment about this movie: stop thinking and have a great time. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `Freddy Vs. Jason'",Freddy vs. Jason
4,kosmasp,Alright,6,2 April 2007,"The movie itself is alright. It's exactly what it says! Freddy vs. Jason. And while we might never see my favorite movie be made (Ash vs. Freddy vs. Jason), there might be another movie around the corner, maybe involving M. Myers.But back to this film. It delivers what it promises, the battle of the titans. Wrapped up in a nice story. And while all is good, I can't stop wondering, if there wasn't any way to make more of that particular premise ... The movie is fine, but it's just not excellent.And one thing is for sure: Kelly Rowland plays one of the most annoying characters that I have seen in a long time. Now either she is a good actress and played that really well ... or she is a bad actress and that showed on screen (I personally think it's the latter).A nice teen horror movie, with two of the most recognised horror characters out there!",Freddy vs. Jason
5,Sleepin_Dragon,It's still pretty good.,7,2 September 2020,"The clash of The Titans, The Evil Titans, Freddy returns from the forgotten recesses of the mind to once again cause havoc, this time he has company, Jason Voorhees.It's not to be taken too seriously, it really is everything you'd expect from the title. It's brash, over the top, a typical early 2000's slasher movie.Englund steals it, some of the acting is a bit dodgy to say the least.It shouldn't work, but somehow it does, it's fun, 7/10.",Freddy vs. Jason
6,lee_eisenberg,next should have the guys meet Michael Myers,7,3 July 2010,"Two of cinema's most famous slashers meet at last. Ronny Yu's ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is definitely an excuse to have fun, as claw-fingered Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) uses hockey-masked Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) to carry out his deeds. Yes, it's got a number of the typical slasher clichés, but this isn't intended as the next ""Citizen Kane"". It seems like in that one scene, Freddy uses Jason as a pinball machine! It's definitely a good time whenever disfigured/masked maniacs butcher horny kids, and it's really cool when said maniacs finally face off. This is truly one to remember.I would like to see Freddy and Jason get to face off against Michael Myers.",Freddy vs. Jason
7,jboothmillard,Freddy vs. Jason,4,14 January 2012,"For many horror fans this must have been a dream come true, like creatures Alien and Predator afterwards, two of the most renowned movie psycho killers who have both equalled a good amount of sequels and franchises are brought together, because of their connection with never dying, and you we see them fight to the death, from director Ronny Yu (The 51st State, Seed of Chucky). Basically killer and child molester Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) (from the Nightmare on Elm Street series) is stuck living in Hell because no children remember him, and he can't enter people's dreams, therefore he acts as the mother (Paula Shaw) of killer and deformed Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) (from the Friday the 13th series) so that he can rise from his own Hell. On earth Jason will commit murders of various teenagers in the town of Springwood, back on Elm Street where Freddy has attacked before, and the deaths will be blamed on Krueger so that his memory will return to people and he can escape Hell and invade dreams again. Eventually enough people know about Freddy again and he devises his plan to get rid of Jason, who is indeed going on a killing spree and will not stop, and this turns into a bloody battle when they come face to face with each other. Stuck in the middle of this killers' battle are surviving teenagers trying to get out of the town, and also heading for Camp Crystal Lake, alive by trying to find a way to stop Freddy and Jason equally. They manage to get Freddy out of the dream world into reality, and this only makes him more keen to kill Jason in any way he can, and vice versa, but they both end up killed by the teenagers, although not permanently. Also starring Monica Keena as Lori Campbell, Jason Ritter as Will Rollins, Kelly Rowland as Kia Waterson, Chris George Marquette as Charlie Linderman, Brendan Fletcher as Mark Davis, Katharine Isabelle as Gibb, Scary Movie's Lochlyn Munro as Deputy Scott Stubbs and look out for Lost's Evangeline Lilly as School Student - Next to Locker. Englund may have a more gravelly voice that is not his own, and Kirzinger's character (previously Kane Hodder) never speaks, but together they are still very fearsome as the undead and supremely violent monsters that can never die, and the human actors are fine, I wasn't expecting to see ex Destiny's Child singer Rowland, I was glad to see her being feisty to one of the killers, but her death could have been better. To be honest, that is all this film delivers, some good, highly violent, blood filled and often inventive deaths, both Freddy and Jason deliver equally vicious kills to their victims, and fighting each other they are very brutal too, so while the story is not much to be bothered about, the confrontation and savagery is, an alright horror. Okay!",Freddy vs. Jason
8,ma-cortes,Shocker movie with an impressive and bloody duel of the two terror titans,6,26 July 2005,"The picture deals upon the resurrection of Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and Freddy (final movie in which Robert Englund plays the role of Freddy Krueger) who are lurking and killing a young band (Monica Keena , Kelly Rowland, , Brendan Fletcher and special mention for Katharine Isabelle of cult-film Ginger Snaps (2000) a Canadian werewolf film) afflicted of demented nightmares in Elm Street , a deputy (Lochlyn Munro) will investigate with fateful consequences .The film takes accent as the entertainment as the guts and blood .The grisly murders are creepy and scary, they are realized by means of subjective camera in the stabbing shots , becoming the viewer the murderer. In the movie there are shocks , horror , tense , suspense , screams and great loads of blood and gore . This scary picture blends the events developed in Crystal Lake where emerged the killer Jason and happenings from Elm Street which came out Freddy . The lake at Camp Crystal Lake was also being used to film the final scenes for X-Men 2 (2003) at the same time this movie was being filmed. , in fact the two film casts even stayed at the same hotel. During lasting the film , Freddy and Jason carry out an extreme slaughter and gory massacre of adolescents and being used in the nauseating and gruesome assassinations al kinds of tools : axes , knife, saw ,and cleaver ; until the final confrontation that results to be spectacular, violent and spooky . From the start to finish the terror action and dark humor are continued and that's why it is amusing . It stars the terror idol Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger standing at 6'5"" -1.96 meters- tall, is the tallest actor to date to play Jason Voorhees . According to Robert Englund, his Freddy make-up was so thick that he couldn't tell how hot it was from the fires during shooting . When he got in to have his make-up removed, it had bonded itself to his face. The motion picture is rated ¨R¨ for crude and cruel killings and scabrous violence which tends to revolt and disgust and the stomach churns , it is only apt + 18 , isn't for squeamish . The film turn out to be entertaining as well as fast- moving . And the horror pace was well directed by Ronnie Yu . The flick will appeal to Freddy and Jason saga fans and terror cinema enthusiastic.",Freddy vs. Jason
9,BA_Harrison,Laydeeez 'n' gennlemen! Welcome to the main event of the night...,8,12 November 2009,"In this enjoyably silly movie-maniac mash-up from director Ronny Yu, the adults of Springfield have taken extreme measures to ensure that dream-demon Freddy Krueger has all but been forgotten; with no-one to fear him, poor old Freddy is rendered powerless to kill. The ever resourceful 'bastard son of a hundred maniacs' isn't giving up without a fight, however, and enlists the help of indestructible, hockey-mask wearing Jason Vorhees to once again strike terror into the hearts of Elm Street's residents.As the relentless, machete wielding monster goes on a bloody killing spree, Freddy sits back to take all the credit, and the frightened locals once more begin to whisper his name in fear. But Jason is having so much fun that he doesn't want to stop, and so Freddy must take matters in hand...The merging of the Friday and Nightmare franchises was first hinted at in the closing moments of Jason Goes To Hell, and in Freddy vs. Jason, it finally becomes a reality: Mr. Krueger and Mr. Vorhees, arguably horror cinema's most iconic maniacs, go head-to-head in a battle to see who is the ultimate king of slice and dice.Unsurprisingly, with such a daft premise, the makers Freddy vs. Jason make no real attempts at scaring their audience, and instead offer viewers a camp, tongue-in-cheek popcorn horror packed with busty teenage girls, horny drunken blokes, CGI special effects, OTT gore, Krueger's jokey one-liners, and even more gore. The cast—well aware of the preposterous nature of the film—pitch their performances accordingly: Monica Keena makes a likable heroine (nice rack, too!), Kelly Rowland is thoroughly annoying and deserving of a nasty death, Chris Marquette does his nerd routine to perfection, Englund hams it up to eleven, and a couple of assorted bimbos get their thruppenies out. It ain't Shakespeare, but it sure is loads of fun.Ronny Yu, the man responsible for the equally entertaining Bride of Chucky, keeps the action moving at a brisk pace and provides plenty of slick, crowd-pleasing moments for fans of mindless sex and violence (the man used to work in the Hong Kong film industry, so it's not surprising that the action is well orchestrated madness): Jason crushes a victim in his fold-up bed, crashes a rave, hacks off a head, and cuts one poor guy completely in half, whilst Freddy saves most of his energy for an excellent final smack-down with Jason, which rounds off the film in great style.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Freddy vs. Jason
10,paul_haakonsen,A clash of icons long awaited...,7,16 December 2015,"This New Line Cinema crossover was long awaited and even longer to see the light of day. And when it came out it was a mixed ride for me. Why? Well, I was thrilled that the movie came into being and that I would finally get to see two iconic slashers go head to head. And it had Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and... wait, but no, it didn't have Kane Hodder as Jason, and that was the biggest disappointment in the movie.Without going too much into the details of the storyline, then Freddy and Jason are back to do what they do best, kill and spread terror. But the witty dream killer comes face to face with the hockey masked slasher.""Freddy vs. Jason"" of course has Robert Englund to carry it, but alongside him were talents such as Brendan Fletcher and Zack Ward. Ken Kirzinger had some massive shoes to fill out in the role as Jason Voorhees after Kane Hodder, and while he is no Hodder, he still did a good job.This movie was a good result of a long awaited crossover between the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"" movies. And I guarantee that the ending will prove equally fulfilling to fans of either of these two iconic slashers.",Freddy vs. Jason
11,Quinoa1984,"You know the words by heart, now here's a change in the music",6,16 August 2003,"That's what I felt after seeing this film, Freddy Vs. Jason.  Right when they introduced the characters I knew them so well, their personalities, emotions, motives and all, that not one human character could have (or would have tried to) surprise me with ingenuity in their performances.  So, that's the downside to Freddy Vs. Jason, a downside that will either poke the viewer harshly in the ribs, or will just remain as the typical, expectedly lame backdrop for the match-up.  I felt a little of both, though I tried to be confident that the main show would be worth the Hollywood-ish mish-mash.The main show, however, is the only reason to see the movie:  Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund), the old gent from Elm Street, is down in hell wanting another grab at 'his' children, so he implements a sort of decoy in the form of lake-boy Jason Voorhees, who begins slaying far more than Freddy could want to see for someone other than himself.  So, he decides that it's time to kick some a**, and that's when the fun begins.  To die-hards of both series (I like a few from each series, and personally, I'm more for Freddy than Jason in the genre because at least Freddy can give some funny dialog in terrifying moments while Jason stares blankly, except for when his mother calls him) this is like seeing two legends standing up in the ring for a prizefight.  Each one has their weaknesses, but they each know who to throw their punches with style, and (we hope) that they can stay invincible until the last round.  I won't reveal who wins (they're enough skeeves on the message boards doing that), but what I can say is that if it only wasn't for the people in the movie (I'll exclude the Jay rip-off since he garnered the most laughs) acting so blandly, strategically like how they're told to do in such a piece, this would've been a near excellent horror movie.  Never-the-less, that could be considered moot, since that's what's to ALWAYS be expected for these gobledy-gook slasher pieces.  The point is, I didn't leave the theater feeling swindled by the hype of the matching (unlike how I would if they ever, EVER decide to make a Superman vs. Batman piece of drek).  C+",Freddy vs. Jason
12,BandSAboutMovies,So much promise,6,13 April 2018,"Finally, after years of development stops and starts, arguably the two biggest horror icons of the 1980's would fight. Helmed by The Bride with White Hair director Ronny Yu, this would be the last film in both villain's series before they were rebooted.Freddy is stuck in Hell, powerless because the children of Springwood have forgotten about him. He disguises himself as Pamela Vorhees and sends a message to Jason, begging him to kill the teens he can no longer reach.The adults cover it up, just as they have for years. They don't want Freddy ever coming back, so they even send his victims to a sanitarium and give them Hypnocil to suppress their dreams. Freddy starts coming back with each kill, but then he realizes that Jason cannot be contained and that his mayhem will only cost him victims. Our protagonists try to pull Freddy from the dream world into our world, but Freddy catches Jason in his dream world, using his fear over drowning to defeat him. At the last moment, Jason actually saves everyone by returning to our world.By the end, Freddy is decapitated and Jason is dead. Or is he? Of course, he raises from the lake, holding his machete and Freddy's head as the bastard son of a thousand maniacs winks to the audience.Sadly, Kane Hodder was replaced by the even larger Ken Kirzinger. The director wanted a bigger, bulkier Jason. Oh well. Also, Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child is in this.While sequels were planned (rumored battles were to include Ash from Evil Dead, Pinhead from Hellraiser and Michael Myers from Halloween), nothing ever happened. There was a comic series that did this - more on that later.The movie figures out a nice way to connect the characters, but they went even further in the original script. One idea was that Freddy either raped or had a consensual sexual encounter with Jason's mother, and as a result, was Jason's dad. Or maybe Freddy had worked at Camp Crystal Lake and was the reason behind Jason's death. These ideas felt too contrived and were dropped.",Freddy vs. Jason
13,Coventry,They made the best movie possible considering the lame idea...,7,16 November 2003,"As long as I've been a horror fan, ( which is about 12 years now ) the rumors about these two undeniable icons meeting each other in one movie were never far away. There were always possible plots going around for a huge battle between Freddy Krueger ( Nightmare on Elm Street - 6 sequels so far ) and Jason Vorhees ( Friday the 13th - 9 sequels so far ). But until Ronny Yu said he would finally make a movie of it, there never was any confirmation. Mister Yu  seems to make a point out of messing up solid horror franchises. He's the same guy that brought us Bride of Chucky as well, although that wasn't such a bad movie as everybody says...BIG SPOILER WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!And neither is Freddy Vs. Jason a bad movie ... Heck, I even enjoyed it a lot. That is to say...as long as it really is about FREDDY and JASON !! The sequences were Jason is slashing up teenagers and Freddy makes diabolical plans are fun, good and even scary from time to time. It were all the side characters and their performances that spoiled the movie, I think.  I admit that the girl are very beautiful but they sure can't act and have some of the most retarded dialogues I've ever heard. For example: ""Wait a minute...Freddy died through fire and Jason through water. How can we use that??"" ...um...sure honey, why don't you show some more of that gorgeous cleavage and shut up, okay ? There's also this goofy potsmoking kid walking through the screen and he's clearly based on Jay's character in the Kevin Smith movies. I'm not quite sure what the meaning behind that is. And finally, Ronny Yu knows all the typical clichés and he's not afraid to use them...We have the dorky kid who suffers from asthma and the bitchy beauty who picks on him all the time. Obviously they start to like each other near the end. Ugh...luckily Jason is there to slaughter them brutally before they have the chance to kiss. In case you haven't found out yet...I'm a huge Jason Vorhees fan myself. I like his primitive personality which fits much better for horror icon I think. While Freddy builds up a whole illusion and nightmarish world before killing his victims, Jason just wipes them away. During the many pointless scenes when the teenagers are thinking up theories, you can amuse yourself by searching for the many references to earlier sequels or completely other horror milestones. The trivia elements are really numerous and an extra value for horror buffs. Many of the killings and battles were far over the top ( I didn't realize there was so much blood in a man's body when you slice them ) but what the heck. Maybe I felt like a young teenager again because brutal horror was back on the big screen or maybe I was just in a violent mood but I really enjoyed watching Freddy VS. Jason and I think I'll even buy it on DVD when it gets released...Vote Jason !!!!",Freddy vs. Jason

15,hitchcockthelegend,"Welcome to my world, bitch.",7,8 August 2010,"Freddy vs. Jason is directed by Ronny Yu (Bride Of Chucky) and stars Monica Keena, Kelly Rowland, Jason Ritter, Chris Marquette & Robert Englund. The film pitches against each other the two villains of the A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th franchises. It is set after Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare & Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. The plot sees the terror of Elm Street, Freddy Krueger, suffering in nowhere land on account that the kids of Elm Street have forgotten all about him. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare & Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. The plot sees the terror of Elm Street, Freddy Krueger, suffering in nowhere land on account that the kids of Elm Street have forgotten all about him. However, he hatches a plan to bring the unkillable Jason Vorhees into the lives of the Springwood children and get the nightmares started again to bring him back into play. What he didn't bargain for was that Jason is a force all by himself and quickly steals Freddy's territorial thunder..and he doesn't like it.It was a project first mooted back in 1987, the idea of pairing two of modern horror's most fondly thought of icons was never far away. After a considerably troubled path thru the years (it's believed that up to 18 scripts had been written for the idea) the bogeyman smack down finally arrived in 2003. Tho receiving the expected mixed reviews from professional critics, the film was embraced by the horror faithful and was a box office success (made for $30 million it grossed almost $112 million Worldwide). The film does exactly what the title suggest it will, namely loads of blood and horror fisticuffs. The plot of course is as daft as it gets and the dialogue often cheesy, but the action and humour more than make up for the pitfalls of both franchises. While some of the stunt work and fight set pieces are of such a high standard; they wouldn't be out of place in a bigger budgeted summer popcorner.Great for fans of the two titular icons, not so for those looking for Val Lewton atmospherics or a Corman like Poe adaptation. The clue is in the title folks. 7/10",Freddy vs. Jason
16,Theo Robertson,About Ten Years Too Late,2,27 February 2005,"Someone decides to make a movie featuring two horror icons ! Possibly not a bad idea . Someone decides to make a horror film about two horror icons from the 1980s ! I'm starting to think this might be a bad idea . Someone decides to make a horror movie about two horror icons from the 1980s and release it into cinemas in 2003 . Bad idea dude No seriously it's a really bad idea . Think about it - The audience for horror movies are those cinema goers in their late teens and early twenties and the last film featuring Freddy Kruger was released in 1991 with much of the target audience not being born until after the first NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST . You know that bit in the first movie where the teenager sinks into the bed ? Well the actor playing that hapless youth is Johnny Depp . I'm sure even Johnny Depp can't remember what his character in the movie was called which shows you how long the series was made . Do you remember the scene in the first Friday THE 13TH movie where the guy is lying in bed and he gets a knife through him . Can you remember the actor's name ? It's Kevin Bacon ( Yes that one ) and again I doubt if Bacon can recall what his character was called Can you see the point I'm making ? Both franchise are mostly forgotten in an era that needs gimmicks in horror movies . THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT had a gimmick ( A very poor one ) and so does this movie , again a very poor one which holds up the story . In order to remind people who Freddy ( Freddy is centre stage ) and Jason ( Jason gets a raw deal just like the Frankenstien monster in the Universal monster mash movies of the 1940s ) are there's reams of script going over old ground and boy is it old , in fact I almost thought the characters were going to refer to the Dead Sea as "" The sprightly sea that is in very good health "" , that's how old it is . As for the characters they're composed of one dimensional cyphers with the girls having very large breasts and the boys having very small brains I was going to award this needless pile of crap one out of ten but gave it a two simply because Ronny Yu makes an explosive ending ( I mean that in a literal sense ) with the final scene being well photographed and atmospheric , but apart from that I have little good things to say about a movie that should have been made ten years earlier or not at all , with not all being the more preferable option",Freddy vs. Jason
17,Scarecrow-88,Freddy vs Jason,6,4 May 2009,"Freddy has been forgotten and uses zombie Jason Voorhies as his tool to reawaken his name to a new generation who do not know of his existence thanks to the shelter of an experimental drug known as Hypnocil which keeps you from dreaming. Elm Street is a thriving suburban community with plenty of fresh teenage victims for Freddy to slice and dice, but he must compete with the undead psycho he brought back from the grave. Using Lori Campbell(Monice Keena)as his guide, Freddy will once again emerge from his slumber hoping to re-establish his menacing prominence once again..but soon his adversary will be the hockey-masked butcher, Jason, in a tug-of-war for dominance and there's only room enough, it seems, for one supreme killing machine. Soon Lori will join forces with her boyfriend, Will(Jason Ritter)who has returned from an institution along with fellow ""inmate"" Mark(Brendan Fletcher), her best friend, Kia(Kelly Rowland), nerdy Charlie Linderman(Chris Marquette)and pothead Freeburg(Kyle Labine). Newly appointed deputy, Scott Stubbs(Lochlyn Munro)doesn't know about Krueger, and is told by his commanding officer, Sheriff Williams(Gary Chalk)to hush his mouth about how the series of murders plaguing the town could relate to a copycat of Jason Voorhies. Lori will soon discover that her mom was actually murdered by Freddy and she plots to drag him from his place of power, the nightmare-world, into reality, hoping that Jason will eliminate him once and for all. The ultimate showdown will take place in Camp Crystal Lake and neither will play for keeps with the poor teens caught right in the middle.I can just imagine what critics were thinking when word got out that a film pitting two franchises they all hate would be coming together with notable slasher icons Jason and Freddy duking out for supremacy. There's no doubt that if you pry too deep into the screenplay obvious holes will be arise, but FREDDY VS JASON is a movie made specifically for the fans, a dream match up of two formidable creatures who have preyed upon many victims throughout the 80's. It's clear that Robert Englund was having a blast as Krueger, but FREDDY VS JASON is an exercise in special effects and grue. What sets this ""clash of the titans"" apart from the films that spawned this film is the ability of the director(..the style and look of the film are great)and a decent cast of young stars(..compared to casts in the past of these two franchises, they are . And, Yu has the benefits of CGI unlike his predecessors(..if that's a good or bad benefit, you decide). It was nice seeing the film address Krueger's antics before becoming the dream-killer, and this gave fans a chance to see into the memories of Jason, summoning up the psychological damage caused by past trauma and how vital Pamela was in his role as a teen-exterminator. In their battle, both fight each other on their own turf, Freddy in his world and Jason at Camp Crystal Lake. I understand if people have an issue with Jason's fear of the water because he has walked through it in the past. And some of the hip dialogue is a bit heavy-handed(..such as Rowland's insults towards Freddy's attire and manhood), but, if anything, fans of Friday series will be certain to enjoy the carnage left by Jason's machete.I have a beef with Yu over turning Kane Hodder away from the role of Jason, but Kirk Kirzinger appropriately fills the role, quite intimidating with a towering presence. I'm just the kind of guy who thinks you ought to be loyal to the man who made the role of Jason his own. I was quite happy with the casting of Keena because she's equal parts eye candy(..gotta love that impressive bust)and expressive, with a range excelling other final girls from the past. Katharine Isabelle is always a welcome sight as far as I'm concerned, quite a sex kitten, but she barely registers as a victim, a friend of Lori's whose boyfriend was crushed in half by Jason while waiting for her in bed. Weird use of a worm, with Freddy's face, forcing it's way into the throat of Freeburg. Nifty sequence where Freddy announces his return by burning it into the back of a victim. Don't look for high art or a perfectly realized story because the film is built simply as a method of bringing Freddy and Jason together with the obvious number of teens and adults getting slaughtered in the process. My favorite scene was Jason's attack on a party held within a cornfield, after being set on fire. Lots of blood squirting from wounds. The main fight is grisly to say the least, and I wouldn't want it any other way.",Freddy vs. Jason
18,Doylenf,Should please horror fans but runs out of thrills halfway through...,6,28 October 2008,"ROBERT ENGLUND is back as Freddy (you can't keep a good killer down, at least in a popular horror series), but the script gets stuck halfway through and becomes more and more preposterous as the story goes toward a fiery conclusion.No doubt about it, it's a well photographed film from start to finish and the special effects are fine. The color photography is effective, especially when dealing with a couple of standout fire scenes, including one where Jason walks through a cornfield on fire and spreads the blaze behind him. For the climax, another fiery confrontation on a pier makes a dazzling impression.MONICA KEENA and JASON RITTER carry the main leads capably enough, although Keener's performance consists mostly of screaming on cue. JESSE HUTCH as Trey, the first victim, has the most gruesome death scene which is staged for maximum effect. Of all the cast members, he's the one to watch as future star potential.All in all, it's standard Freddy/Jason material given a lift by some awesome special effects.Summing up: Horror fans who don't demand too much credibility in the way of a script will easily get their money's worth.",Freddy vs. Jason
19,preppy-3,Surprisingly good,8,22 August 2003,"Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) isn't happy.  He's still around but can't kill anybody.  The kids who have dealt with him, and survived, in the past are drugged so they can't dream.  No dreams, no Freddy.  He convinces Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) to visit his town and start killing kids to enpower Freddy (or something like that).  Jason does, Freddy gets stronger but Jason won't stop, and Freddy gets upset...I've seen all the Jason films (even the 2001 debacle ""Jason X"") and all the Freddy films (the last one was in 1994) so I was expecting the worst. Let's face it--with the exceptions of the first ones none of those films were good.  The Freddy films did have inventive murders but the plots made no sense--the Jason films were just one boring murder after another and had continuity that changed from film to film.But this works.  The story makes sense, it's never dull, has a likable cast of characters (especially Jason Ritter--John's son), and has some of the most graphic gore I've seen since the 1980s--the ratings board must of slept through this one (not that I'm complaining)!  Also it's great to see Englund back in good form as Freddy--he's clearly enjoying himself and it rubs off on the audience. Even Kirzinger is good as Jason--he has no dialogue but does convey his thoughts through body language.  The teens (as I said) are likable and (for the first time) talk like teenagers.  It all ends up with a half-hour long battle between Jason and Freddy.  It's gory with gallons of blood, very violent and LOTS of fun!Director Ronny Yu deserves a lot of credit--he did this and ""Bride of Chucky""--another great horror film.  Let's hope he does more!  Highly recommended.  I'm only giving it an 8 because I was never really scared--it IS a horror film you know.Trivia note:  Yu worked with John Ritter on ""Bride..."" and his son Jason this.Best line: After an attack from Jason one teen says, ""That goalie was p***ed over something!""",Freddy vs. Jason
20,poolandrews,Entertaining comic book type horror film featuring two of horror's greatest icons.,9,20 August 2005,"Freddy Vs. Jason starts with Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) bemoaning the fact that the children of Elm Street have forgotten about him & the fear that he feeds off is no longer there, because of this Freddy is currently dead. However Freddy has devised a plan that involves raising notorious indestructible serial killer Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) from the dead & making him carry his killing spree on in Elm Street & there by the fear will return... Cut to 1428 Elm Street, Springfield where it's a dark night & is lashing with rain as three friends Lori Campbell (Monica Keena), Kia Waterson (Kelly Rowland) & Gibb (Katherine Isabelle) are having a night in when two lads arrive Trey (Jesse Hutch) & Blake (David Kopp). Trey & Gibb head off upstairs to have sex, afterwards while in the shower Gibb hears a noise & discovers Trey murdered. In no time the local police are everywhere & Lori overhears Sheriff Williams (Gary Chalk) mention the name Freddy Krueger. Meanwhile Lori's old boyfriend Will Rollins (Jason Ritter) hears about the murder on the news & together with his friend Mark Davis (Brendan Fletcher) escape the mental hospital where they are currently institutionalised. Blake is the next victim as Freddy's name is spread through the local high-school, shortly after Freddy is strong enough to terrorise the children of Elm Street again but he has competition in the form of the seemingly unstoppable Jason. The residents of Springfield are not safe either awake or asleep...Directed by Ronny Yu I though Freddy Vs. Jason was terrific fun, especially if your a die hard horror buff like myself! The script by Damian Shannon & Mark Swift is incredibly silly & not to be taken seriously but makes for good fun & entertainment. Freddy Vs. Jason moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring, something is always happening & it's a nice tight well paced film. There are plenty of film homages & it has a definite sense of fun. While the characters aren't particularly original or well developed they are likable & have just enough about them to care for. There are plenty of one liners & quips & the dialogue isn't exactly absorbing but it suits the comic book feel of the film very well. Between them Freddy & Jason have starred in no less than 17 films (I have seen them all) before Freddy Vs. Jason (plus Freddy got his own TV series) & are perhaps two of my favourite & greatest horror icons ever to grace the silver screen, well I think so anyway so I got a big kick out of seeing these characters that I grew up with in the same film. Director Yu treats them with respect & are instantly familiar & still look pretty imposing even in 2003 some 20 odd years after they first appeared. Director Yu treats us to some serious over-the-top violence which by the end becomes very comic book like, there are plenty of machete violence, stabbings, decapitations, someone is cut in half, arms are ripped off & gory fights galore. Some of the CGI effects are a little fake looking but the make-up effects are a lot better with plenty of spurting blood. There is a strong action element to Freddy Vs. Jason & Yu brings his experience to create some great choreographed fights between Freddy & Jason which become more & more outrageous as the film goes on. The acting is about as good as you would expect from a film such as this but I thought everyone did OK & no one was trying to win an Oscar were they? Even singer Kelly Rowlan didn't annoy me which was a surprise as 'hip' singers don't usually make for good actors. Technically the film is impressive & with a fairly healthy budget of about $25,000,000 that's the least I'd expect. The music mixes familiar tunes & cues from both series of films which helped get me in the mood although I didn't like the annoying rock tracks that much. I liked Freddy Vs. Jason a lot, the filmmakers did a much better job than I could have hoped for. The idea is ridiculous & if you are not into horror then forget it but since I am & I am a definite fan of these two characters I found myself enjoying every overblown, silly but hugely entertaining minute of it! Watch it as soon as possible.",Freddy vs. Jason
21,utgard14,Watchable But Mostly Crap,5,11 May 2014,"Children of the '80s longed for the day when we'd get a movie like this. Too bad when we finally got it, it was steeped in the flaws of horror films from the late '90s onward. The characters are obnoxious on a level that was undreamed of before the late '90s. There's the added elements of high school crap and raves and every cliché you could shake a stick at. The actors are all terrible. Monica Keena goes through the whole movie seemingly on the verge of tears. She's part of the movie's retarded Romeo & Juliet subplot. Also, nearly every girl in the movie has breast implants. The whole thing has more in common with movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer than anything from the '80s. The only saving grace is that the last half-hour or so, when the actual Freddy vs Jason stuff starts, is enjoyable. So, is it good? Well, not really but it is watchable. Although the ""Jason is afraid of water"" stuff is submoronic. It's certainly better than the last few Friday and Elm St. sequels that preceded it.",Freddy vs. Jason
22,Boba_Fett1138,When evil collides.,7,19 November 2009,"This movie brings together the best of two worlds. On the one side we have Freddy Krueger from the A Nightmare on Elm Street-franchise and on the other Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th-series. Both had done their killing throughout the years and are part of a long running successful franchise. This movie had always been sort of coming ever since the '90's. When this movie got released in 2003 it was perhaps a bit too late, for not all people were really waiting for a movie featuring two classic horror-icons that hadn't really appeared in anything ever since the '90's, not counting in ""Jason X"" that had just very little to do with the Friday the 13th-franchise. Perhaps because of this the movie also never truly got the recognition it truly deserves.This movie did certainly not disappoint. To be honest I wasn't expecting much good from it but what it did was having the best elements from the A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th-series in it and it combined it all perfectly, like it was always meant to be for both series to blend in with each other.The movie is definitely not as ridicules as its concept might make it sound like. As far as the genre and both of the series goes, it has a quite plausible story.What the movie does well is that if focuses very well on the two evil characters of the movie; Freddy Kreuger and Jason Voorhees. It explains their history as well, something that never truly got done well enough, or at least not to my satisfaction, in neither the A Nightmare on Elm Street-series or the Friday the 13th one. Especially Jason's fatal day as a kid gets shown well.Both evil's eventually clash in this movie, which in itself is quite interesting fight, since both seem to know each others weaknesses and both are invulnerable till some extend, which means they can really bash in to each other. It's sort of too bad though that once the two characters start to battle each other the movie also becomes more messy to watch. The story is suddenly all over the place, while the movie began so well and promising with its story in its first halve.of course the movie build heavily on its two main iconic characters. Fans of Jason and/or Freddy will not be disappointed by this movie, since both get to do their things. It's not a movie that is holding back with its horror and violence and the movie features quite some gore in it.A nearly perfect and certainly entertaining and satisfying crossover of two legendary horror-series and its iconic characters.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Freddy vs. Jason
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Go in with realistic expectations,7,26 January 2011,"Freddy(having lost his power as the parents of Springwood no longer speak of him to keep their kids ignorant of his existence and thus safe; he gets to do a sexually charged assault) searches the bowels of Hell(PS: it smells down there) to find Jason(who suddenly seems to follow what his mother says, though he's never had specific motives before, only hints of them), and he then sends him to kill teens to regain his ability(...you'd think he'd ponder if they'd maybe think ""hey, that big, hulking dude didn't look like that Krueger dude""). Three(!) slaughters later or so, he tires of it(ADD much?) and plans a revenge(man, don't ever take a job under him, he's a lousy boss). The two(whom we fear considerably) get to do their individual thing(if the focus is shifted a bit towards Elm Street), terrorizing attractive teens(including two mental patients who deliver exposition like there's no tomorrow) and once they get to the climactic battle(no, it isn't the whole movie... that'd get boring), it is brutal(no quick-cutting like in recent action), dense with moves(some of them from pro wrestling), it has an impact(you almost feel the blows yourself), set to heavy metal and they do toss in things that befit them both. The slow, strong goalie towers over the lean, swift predator, and the duel is worth it for fans. There are many references to both franchises sprinkled through this, and the mythology and continuity is somewhat respected. If you don't let yourself get too hyped up, this should do the trick. There is tension and suspense, and this sometimes slips into the dream world like it should: without us realizing until we're there. This is visually appealing(except for the at times extreme lighting) and the atmosphere is great. Most of the deaths are creative and memorable. The pace is nice, this isn't really dull at any point. Other than the lower shutter speed(when the picture looks like it's lagging), Yu knew what he was doing(it's definitely superior to Bride of Chucky). The characters are basically just there, but no one came to this for them. Acting is poor. This keeps you watching attentively the majority of the time, for the 87 minutes sans credits. There is a ton of bloody, gory violence, and a little nudity in this. The DVD comes with an interesting and funny commentary track by director Ronny, Robert Englund(who drops a ton of cinematic references and is the most fun to listen to of the three) and Ken Kirzinger(he doesn't talk that much in it), two hours(!) of well-done, informational featurettes, a music video, a theatrical trailer and the old Jump to a Death. I recommend this to anyone who loves at least one of these series. 7/10",Freddy vs. Jason

In fact, everything outside of the showdown between Freddy and Jason was forgettable. The story, action, dialogue, etc. up until Freddy and Jason faced each other was just filler as far as I was concerned. Fortunatley for teenagers everywhere, Freddy and Jason chose to unleash their fury on each other. The town wasn't big enough for the both of them and apparently Freddy didn't like sharing victims with other rival killers. It's hard to know what Jason thought about Freddy considering Jason doesn't talk. The inevitable battle was great and the scenes leading up to their pairing off were good too. To avoid putting spoilers in this review, I'll just say: you have to watch to find out who wins.",Freddy vs. Jason

To that end, with what little power he has left he manages to reawaken the body of ""Jason Voorhees"" (Ken Kirzinger) which had been submerged under Crystal Lake and sends him to Springwood knowing that he will begin a deadly rampage which might confuse people and thereby reignite the fear of his return that Freddy so desperately needs. Sure enough, at first everything goes according to plan as the townspeople begin to consider that Freddy has indeed returned--and the more they talk about it the stronger he becomes. Unfortunately, Freddy soon begins to realize that Springwood isn't big enough for two serial killers-and this begins a battle to the death between them with a multitude of innocent victims all around. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film due in large part to the fascinating concept of having two super-human psychotics like Freddy and Jason sharing the same spotlight along with excellent special effects highlighting everything. On the flip side, however, I didn't quite care for the extended fight sequence involving the two main antagonists as it seemed to drag on just a bit too long. Even so, I enjoyed this film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Freddy vs. Jason
26,anaconda-40658,Hockey vs Steak Knifes.,5,3 September 2015,"Freddy vs. Jason (2003): Dir: Ronny Yu / Cast: Kelly Rowland, Jason Ritter, Monica Keena, Chris Marquette, Katharine Isabelle: Horror film fanatics know that Freddy Krueger was the child killer in the Nightmare on Elm Street films who was burned by enraged parents. He has since terrorized the children of Elm Street through their dreams using a razor claw glove. Jason Voorhees is the hockey mask killer of the Friday the 13th films who drown as a boy at Camp Crystal Lake. Effective setup regards Freddy losing his power to infect dreams so he poises as Jason's mother and orders him to Elm Street. Then Jason slices and dices a bunch of airheads while Kruger grows frustrated at his loss of notoriety. It promises a showdown between the two killers arranged by a group of teenagers in hopes that Jason with slay Freddy. Directed by Runny Yu who previous made an attempt at the Child's Play franchise with Bride of Chucky. He is accompanied by the expected superb visual elements as well as horrid acting from Destiny's Child pop star Kelly Rowland as well as Jason Ritter, Monica Keena, etc. they are just numbers for the slaughter and nothing more. Even Katharine Isabelle who was cast in the gory yet bizarre Ginger Snaps cannot provide the same magic here.

27,kannibalcorpsegrinder,A lot of fun and gets a lot right between the two,10,23 July 2012,"When a series of attacks are reminiscent of a famous, supposedly- deceased killer, a group of friends comes to the horrifying conclusion there's more than one killer amongst them and try to find a way of dealing with both killers before falling victim to their blood-soaked rampage.This here turned out to be an incredibly fun, immensely enjoyable effort with a lot to like about it. One of the main things in this one is the absolutely impressive story, which is far more clever and well-written than anything like this should be. This one not only manages to make the seemingly-realistic films interact with the more supernatural-in-tone series but throws enough nods to the past that it feels like it fits in with the universe's depicted. It develops a great touch with the forced forgetfulness brought about once again by the introduction of story lines from the other series that really ties it all together which is great on its own but also manages to feature enough to make the few surprises come about logically and convincingly. This storyline flourish is handled with such shock that it could've easily managed to cram even more into the story since there are enough pieces left lying around unexplored to make it enjoyable enough without mentioning the cartoonish fighting here. This is a part of the film for a vast majority of the time as this gives the film so many engaging moments, including the thrilling rampage through the house during their party, a rave crashed by both killers which provides the highlight sight of a burning killer slashing up the party in a full-on massacre and the great action in the mental hospital where not only do they learn the true nature of the town's past but come across the series of fine stalking deep into the hallways leading to some great action. It's also readily shown here in the film's final half-hour, a carnage-splattered showdown that ranks as one of the greater fights in cinema history, with the lead-in including the fantastic flashback to the past drowning in the lake to the dream-world fighting and the battle to get them to the main camp once again as the real big brawl is unleashed. It's stylish, exciting and action-packed, giving each one numerous turns at the upper-hand as both Jason and Freddy have the chance to win and giving it a great feel without being too drawn-out or dull in pacing. Add in a huge body count, enough jokes to relieve the tension and a great feel and this one manages to be enormously enjoyable overall even with a few minor, barely detrimental issues. The main one is that it's all too obvious how Freddy is lower on the kills as he spends too much time taunting rather than going for the kills which somewhat lowers his intensity. It's a little uneven and does stick out here, as does the series of decision-making bringing them together which is really suspect. These here hold it back.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, a sex scene and heavy drug use.",Freddy vs. Jason

Of course, a film like this was always going to disappoint someone, as the title is easily the best thing about it, but you have to love it.If you are a fan of the titular characters, you will find many references to previous movies, and funnily enough, you may find yourself cheering for Jason during the last act, he appears to be the sympathetic one of the two.All in all it's fun, forgettable, and if you watch it now, one cannot help but think that this was intended for a 3D release.",Freddy vs. Jason
29,Wuchakk,"Worthy new millennium entry in the Friday & Nightmare franchises, until they clash, that is",7,23 August 2014,"To be expected, 2003's ""Freddy vs. Jason"" mixes together elements of the ""Nightmare"" and ""Friday"" franchises. Both franchises had essentially ran out of gas in the early 90s -- the last conventional ""Friday"" movie, before 2001's ""Jason X,"" came out a decade earlier and the last ""Nightmare"" movie almost as long. So mixing up the formats was a great way to introduce these modern monsters to a new generation as well as re-introduce them to the old.THE PLOT: Freddy Krueger, the wicked spirit of a child molester/serial killer, is trapped in hell and unable to wreak havoc on the youths of Springwood, Ohio, because they have forgotten him and therefore no longer believe. Krueger's diabolical plan is to lure Jason from Crystal Lake, NJ, to Springwood and inspire him to go on a killing spree, which would naturally be blamed on Kruger, thus giving him the power to return.Some say ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is more of a ""Nightmare"" film than a ""Friday"" film, and I can see why, but it's really an equal parts crossover. Once Jason is led to Springwood it essentially becomes a ""Nightmare"" movie with Jason as the antagonist until Freddy gains enough power; by that time the story switches to Crystal Lake for the finale and even provides an insightful flashback (via a dream sequence) of Jason's youth and abuse.One of the highlights takes place early in the second act: Jason's flaming attack at a teen party in a cornfield; it's a dynamic sequence and features great opticals.As with all the Friday films, ""FvJ"" features a nice assortment of women, beginning with the cameo of Heather (Odessa Munroe) in the opening reel. She's pretty much on par with the cameo of Agent Marcus (Julie Michaels) at the beginning of ""Jason Goes to Hell."" From there we have cutie Katharine Isabelle as a secondary protagonist and Monica Keena as the heroine. It took me about half the movie to warm up to Monica but she ultimately won me over.""Freddy vs. Jason"" is a noticeably more technically sophisticated than the first nine ""Friday"" movies. Don't get me wrong, it's very cartoony and hardly scary (except for jump scares and gore), but it LOOKS so much better and has more oomph. The story's also way more involved than the first eight entries and ""Jason X,"" which makes the film play better on repeat viewings.The fight between the two monsters in the closing act is a cinematic tradition going back earlier than 1945's ""The Wolf Man vs. Dracula"" (aka ""House of Dracula""), but it's the weak point of the movie for me because it's just too cartoony. The film works as horror with either Jason or Freddy attacking the youths, but when they finally clash in the action-packed climax it's just too comic booky.The film runs 97 minutes and was shot mostly in British Columbia, Canada (e.g. Buntzen Lake, Anmore), but also Toronto.GRADE: B",Freddy vs. Jason
30,Aaron1375,Freddy pretty much is the focus of this one.,8,15 August 2003,"I liked this movie, but I couldn't help notice that Freddy seemed to be the focus of this one.  Jason was basically in this as another means for the teens to try and get rid of Freddy.  Freddy gets the opening as scenes from previous movies are shown of his while Jason gets less time devoted to his origins...except for a rather good scene that shows how he drowned in the first place.  I am guessing New Line wasn't allowed to show any of Jason's previous movies, as I don't think they had the rights to any of his movies except for the tenth one.  This movie has Freddy with basically no power because he is all but forgotten.  He uses Jason to kill on Elm Street to get people talking about him again.  Why Freddy picks Jason is never really known, you would think any psycho would have done and been more cooperative. Well Jason gets the people talking about Freddy again, but he doesn't just go away, but rather he sticks around and continues to kill.  This irks Freddy and this sets up the showdown between the two.  There are a couple of subplots in this one that really don't add anything to the film, like the father killing the mother and the cover-up of that murder.  That one seemed rather pointless as the dad just disappears after awhile.  The fight though is what you paid to see and you get plenty of gory action.  In fact the whole movie is rather gory for any movie these days, when I saw the nude scene at the beginning I was worried and thought they wasted the R rating on that and not gore, but there is plenty of bloodshed.  Jason gets most of the kills, as there is one cool party scene where he goes hacking away, but Freddy still seems the forefront.  Though at times you seem to be watching Friday the 13th, then you seem to shift over to Nightmare on Elm St. Freddy first gets Jason in the dream world and lets just say Jason does not fare to well here as Freddy literally reduces Jason to tears.  The battle, however, shifts to the real world at Crystal Lake no less where Jason fares better and the fight is more equal.  All in all a pretty good movie, just wish they had come up with better ways to introduce Jason and had better subplots.",Freddy vs. Jason
31,zetes,The movie that fans have been waiting for forever,8,17 August 2003,"And we were going to see it no matter how badly it sucked. Fortunately, it doesn't suck, not at all. I promise that all fans will be more than a little impressed. It represents the best of both movie series, with plenty of goofy, crazy, murderous dreams, a lot of slow walking, ch-ch-ch-ing, machete action, and hot teens in tight clothing. Freddy Kreuger has been forgotten by the children, and he can no longer terrorize them. To solve his problems, he resurrects Jason Voorhees to remind the people of the horrific events of the past. Soon Freddy Kreuger's long unspoken name is beginning to resurface, and he's gaining his power back. But Jason isn't about to stop his rampage. When he steals Freddy's victims, the two begin to tussle. Their battles are the best part of the movie, though. They're everything and more than I could have hoped for. But the teen victims are a little better this time around than they have been in the past. Well, the Nightmare on Elm Street movies always had mostly decent characters, while Jason's victims were little more than fodder. The story has some holes, but who cares? The concept works so well because of the well thought out combination of the series. We never have time to get bored with Nightmare's surreal dreamscape or Freddy's cheesy one liners, and Friday's natural repetitiveness is completely solved by the juxtaposition. I'm sure most won't care to see it, but, as a fan, I've got to say it really satisfied my bloodlust.",Freddy vs. Jason
32,trashgang,the one the fans were waiting for,5,3 February 2011,"It took ten years before the clash of the titans became real. Once this flick was finally out the fans were shocked, hated it or loved it. I think for myself that those kind of flicks never work. Look what they did with Alien and the Predator flicks. But it is out there so to end the franchise I must watch it. Did I regret it, no. It was way better than Jason X. There is also like in X a lot of CGI used but it was used for the dream sequences when Freddy appears. The blood do flows but as I said earlier in other reviews, the Friday flicks aren't really known for the gore. But having Ronny Yu coming from Hong Kong as a director you can see easily the effect used on the effects with the blood squirting out of bodies, typical eastern style. Of course there is nudity but not that much. You got some full frontal nudity in the first 5 minutes and a shower scene were I guess it was a stand-in, you don't see her face and seeing the girl before she surely hadn't those kind of breasts. I will spoil something by telling that they both aren't losers or winners but they are tortured by the machete and the glove. I didn't have any problems with the new Jason played by Ken Kirzinger, I had more problems with Freddy's voice. And Monica Keena gives the best she can. It is still weird to see them both collide and by so far it was the end of the franchise, if you don't count the remake with it.",Freddy vs. Jason

If his IQ is 70 that's about it; Freddy can talk, and articulate a plan.  This is why the movie focused around Freddy. Freddy gets the worst at the end of the movie, but the not too bright Jason gets the brunt of it throughout. In this matter the film is comical, like Bugs and Road runner. (all they needed was the anvil and hot air balloon) The story is original with Freddy needing Jason in order to create fear on Elm Street; and I never knew Elm Street was so close to camp Crystal.

We had our slutty girl, the smart but always sexy girl who's a virgin, the funny stereotype black girl, a geek, a stoner, the sensitive boyfriend, and two of the coolest boogeymen of all horror cinema.The plot, at first I had questioned how they'd do it. I mean, we got a killer from Camp Crystal Lake and a killer who haunts your dreams. But they made Freddy loose his powers and he needed the kids to be afraid so he could be strong again while feeding on their fear, but how can he do that when he's not that effective in his nightmares? Of course! Jason! Jason is like his bubble wrap, he assumes Jason will probably go away or he'll be easy to throw away after the job is done. But he surprises Freddy by staying and for the ultimate battle of who's victims are who.This was just such a blast to watch. Classic horror cliché's and the best battle of the ultimate boogeymen were just too cool. The ending is a cliff hanger, but you have too many votes going towards both sides. We could never decide who is the best at the gore... Freddy! :D Sorry, I just needed to say that. But I think all horror fans will enjoy the battle scenes and the gore. It's just a great tribute to our favorite killers!9/10",Freddy vs. Jason
36,Rainey-Dawn,"Kids Killed, Freddy & Jason After Each Other",6,18 January 2017,"So bloody awful it's pretty good just for the final battle. Comical, fun battle between Freddy and Jason. People die by Freddy and Jason. I guess Michael Myers is at home watching the action, most likely giggling to himself.It's all about Freddy taking over Jason so Jason can kill the Elm Street kids. All this will free Freddy from limbo and everyone will remember the name Freddy Krueger. Kids are killed. Freddy and Jason battle it out in The End.I like this one fairly well, it does have a little bit of the vibes of the original Elm Street film mixed with the 13th franchise. This one takes a little bit of time to get going good, about 20 minutes, but once it gets going it's kinda fun to watch. No it's not a great movie but it is fun in it's way.6/10",Freddy vs. Jason
37,disdressed12,some good funny moments,5,4 February 2008,"well this is an interesting concept,and one that had been rumoured for years.i enjoyed it for its entertainment value,if nothing else.it's got some moments of camp and outright comedy,and it's not scary or anything.it's no more gruesome than any of the movie featuring these two characters,but it's no less either. i mostly enjoyed it for its camp and comedy bits.the rest of it is old hat,you know,people getting hacked and slashed.though i did like the final showdown between Freddy and Jason.this won't come as a surprise to fans of these two series,but there could possibly be a follow up,although the ending is ambiguous,so it's hard to say.anyway,for me Freddy vs.Jason is a 5/10",Freddy vs. Jason
38,OllieSuave-007,One final bout for two menaces (so far).,6,27 August 2014,"In the only film, so far, to feature both Freddy and Jason, Freddy wants to get back to Elm Street and uses Jason to do people in so that he (Freddy) will become stronger. However, Jason manages to anger Freddy, resulting the two in hating on each other and, to the teenagers' advantage, they hope the two demons will kill each other off.It's not the best movie out of both the Nightmare and Friday the 13th franchises, but it's not that bad of a movie to watch for a little fun and entertainment. It is quite intriguing seeing two of the horror genre's most notorious maniac killers duke it out, with the usual screaming teens getting caught in the crossfires.The violence and gore level was a little excessive and the overly-sexual materials has gotten old in the series. The acting was OK for the most part and the action scenes weren't that bad, so, it is a serviceable horror flick to keep you occupied for 97 minutes.Grade C",Freddy vs. Jason
39,thesar-2,"How Sweet, Dark Meat",9,20 January 2009,"As a devoted fan of both series  probably more so 'Nightmare' than 'Friday' (saw 'Nightmare 4' 5x in the theater)  I can honestly say: I loved 'Freddy Vs. Jason.' Loved it. The fact that they had two Goliaths in one film (a smaller scale 'King Kong Vs. Godzilla') and still made time to reintroduce the 80s killers to a new audience, was amazing. In fact, they hit every major plot point from both film franchises while building a new one and if this were the first exposure to a viewer who's never even heard of the ""child killer"" or the ""camp counselor killer,"" they did their job. Having just watched the entire 'Friday the 13th' series in preparation for the 'Friday' reboot coming soon, I can say this one contains probably the most kills, the best acting, the funniest lines and the perfect homage to those of us that grew up with 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' on 'Friday the 13th.' That being said, it wasn't flat out perfect: it was one of the weakest and least scary Jason, editing was off a bit, the ""fear"" Jason had of the water didn't make any sense  he was in/out of Crystal Lake dozens of times in the series and he seemed to know how to swim just fine, and on a personal note: I didn't find the gay slur Kia spits out at Freddy relevant (or necessary) and why did they have to kill off the 2 cutest characters up front? So, it wasn't perfect, but it was darn near it. Freddy was hilarious, as usual, the actors Keena, Fletcher, Rowland, Marquette and Labine were all hilarious and great in their roles, and when we finally get to the showdown, we're not let down. Pinball. ""Tilt!"" ""Give me a break!"" Awesome.",Freddy vs. Jason
40,bensonmum2,Insulting,2,23 August 2005,"I finally got around to watching Freddy vs. Jason last night. My immediate reaction: I don't understand how anyone who considers themselves fans of Freddy, Jason, or horror movies in general could enjoy this piece of garbage. The movie is an insult to the intelligence of any thinking fan of horror. I could almost feel my IQ dropping while the movie played. Freddy and Jason have become parodies of themselves and are no long in the slightest frightening. Their final epic battle is little more than a poorly done video game. The CGI is terrible and completely unrealistic. I can understand a large man such as Jason being able to sink a heavy ax into someone's head, but punching someone so hard they fly through the air? Come on! This is superhero comic book stuff, not horror.And whatever happened to character development? Sure, the older movies in both series featured characters that weren't much more than stereotypes, but at least we were given a chance to get to know something about them before they died. Freddy vs. Jason doesn't even give the viewer the opportunity to determine who the jock, slut, dork, and good girl are before they are butchered.Say what you will about the older movies in both series, but they come off like horror masterpieces compared with this thing. Unless you're a 13-year-old fanboy who has only seen one horror movie, I'll never fathom how anyone could place this movie at the top of a horror list or give it a rating of 10/10. And to top it off, there are actually people hoping for a sequel! Count me out.",Freddy vs. Jason
41,Robert_duder,The terrific meeting of two iconic slashers,8,12 January 2012,"This is one of those movies that was in the works for a decade, rumours and whispers but this time they finally got around to making it. It isn't easy bringing together two huge movie characters but horror characters like Freddy and Jason seem primed to be put up against each other. However, it doesn't hurt that this actually has a solid great horror story, and the two horror giants together is just amazing guilty cult fun! Actually I think the film makers were pretty clever in making this and they do focus more on Jason being he was the more popular at this moment. Best of all the way the writers brought together the two characters was actually really well written and fits into both characters story lines.Robert Englund is as twisted and disturbed as ever playing his iconic killer Freddy Kreuger. There's only so much you can say about his performance as, at this point, he's been doing it for over ten years and he does it very well. Prolific Stuntman Ken Kirzinger picks up the hockey mask to play Jason Voorhees and he does a great job. He's hulking and has the motion down perfectly. Its a shame he didn't continue in the role. The supporting cast really don't stand out in the film. They don't get a lot of depth and they are really just casualties in the way of Jason and Freddy's battle. Monica Keena does well as Lori and Jason Ritter also does a decent job as Will Rollins. The rest of them are just sort of there.Ronny Yu might seem to not have a lot of experience in this genre but he did Bride of Chucky which is a great precursor to this sort of film. Gory, bloody, funny, cheesy, good story, iconic character(s)...and Yu does all of that quite well. Why they didn't serialize this particular take on the series I will never know. I think they could have milked this and I personally would have gone back many times. Unfortunately this is all we have and its fun and outrageous and worthy of any horror fan's collection. 8.5/10",Freddy vs. Jason
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Dumb but fun.,7,31 August 2021,"Essentially, 'Freddy Vs. Jason (2003)' is the eighth entry in the 'A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984)' franchise and the eleventh (though tenth canonically) entry in the 'Friday The 13th (1980)' franchise, picking up a little while after the events of both 'Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991)' and 'Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday (1993)'. I expected it to be more of a spin-off than a sequel, which is why I watched it without having seen 'Friday' five through ten and 'Nightmare' two through seven. Thankfully, there's a quick recap at the start and the links to the previous films are more like references, really. As such, I was never lost. I also expected the picture not to be all that good. Imagine my surprise, then, when the opposite turned out to be true. Perhaps because of my low expectations, I actually had a blast with this and I'm not ashamed to admit it. Sure, it's not great - in fact, it might not even be all that good - but it's fun and that's all that really matters. It's the sort of film that I might call a 'guilty pleasure' if I believed in such a thing (there's generally no reason to feel guilty about liking a movie), and it's actually rather well made in some respects. Its effects work, in particular, is a highlight; most of it is practical and lends real weight to the bloodshed. The problems with the piece lie mainly in its screenplay, which actually does a reasonably good job of getting its two horror icons onto the same playing field so that the eponymous battle can take place. The issues come mainly from the fact that it's generally quite generic and equally as messy. At a certain point, it transitions from a relatively serious slasher that sees both its killers terrorise Elm Street to a pretty goofy series of bouts between those same murderers. It's a subtle but distinct tonal shift that's a bit distracting, even if both sides of the equation are relatively enjoyable. It's like two films mashed into one and not in the way you'd expect. Another problem is the fact that Jason really is relegated to a mindless slasher. I mean, he's never been much more than that but he somehow seems even less interesting here. He has no proper motivation, aside from that which Freddy gives him, and he doesn't really have much to do until the final movement. Freddy is presented a bit better - allowed to be the mastermind, as it were - and he has several entertainingly creepy scenes. Even then, though, he doesn't have any really inventive nightmarish set-pieces, even if a few of his appearances are certainly creative. Still, these issues - among others I haven't touched on here - don't ruin the overall affair. It's dumb but fun and I'd be doing it (and myself) a disservice if I didn't admit how genuinely enjoyable it is. When the eponymous pair finally do go at it, it's sure to make fans of both franchises happy. It's ridiculous - I mean, Freddy's out there fighting like a mix between a burnt-up Bruce Lee and a wretched Rey Mysterio - but, again, it's pure entertainment. The whole movie is almost exactly what it needs to be, warts and all. It's fun; that's all there is to it. 7/10.",Freddy vs. Jason
43,bowmanblue,"Better than Shakespeare... well, maybe",7,14 June 2014,"Freddy vs Jason - arguably the two biggest villains in the teen-slasher genre, at last get to square off against each other. The plot... oh, who really cares about the plot - oversexed, annoying teenagers get killed - that's all you need to know - admit it... you're not watching this for the story, right? And there isn't much of one: Freddy brings Jason back to life to kill people so that, in turn, he too can come back and kill people. And he succeeds. The body count starts to rise, but can the two of them be stopped? I hoped not.Perhaps the biggest problem with this film is that the most 'appealing' characters are both homicidal baddies. We know that we're supposed to be rooting for the teens (well, the virginal blonde one anyway), but they're just so bland compared to the villains. Freddy rocks! He's creepy, nasty, deliciously over-the-top and evil. Jason is dark, brooding and emits seethingness at all times. The kids... well, they're mainly there to die, so who cares about them? If you like slasher movies, this one should appeal to you, but don't watch it for the story or the characters, just watch it for the baddies - they're a million times better than anyone else in the film. Although, if you read reviews online, you'll see the majority of people felt the film favours Jason over Freddy. I didn't see it that way - I thought they both shone (for what they were). I'd love to see a sequel (possibly with 'Pin-head' from the Hellraiser saga), but, seeing as both Nightmare and Friday franchises have been rebooted, it doesn't look like that's about to happen.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Freddy vs. Jason
44,lesleyharris30,"Ridiculous, but that's what makes it so Enjoyable,",5,4 July 2015,"Freddy vs. Jason is a mediocre movie with a fun, albeit very stupid, storyline and an average cast. There's no doubt that it's a ridiculous movie, but that's why I enjoyed, it was so bad that it was actually good, not a single scene sent a shiver down my spine or made me scared, but watching two horror icons, Freddy Krueger and Jason, battle it out to the death, was very simple, mindless fun and it's probably better that it didn't take itself too seriously, and Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger were very confident in their roles. It's obviously a very weak movie in general and it certainly wasn't critically acclaimed. my biggest issue is that there is way too much build up, too much scenes between regular people, it really should have gotten straight to the point, the scenes without Freddy or Jason simply bored me. The other actors in the movie are brutal, they are all very amateur teenage actors, they seemed to be struggling to deliver their lines, and there is certainly no one the audience will be upset in seeing get killed. Freddy vs. Jason is dumb, simple fun, it's great to watch with friends and mock, but if you're looking for an actual horror, I wouldn't recommend it. After Freddy Krueger resurrects Jason Voorhees, he then becomes forced to take him down himself. Best Performance: Robert Englund Worst Performance: Jason Ritter",Freddy vs. Jason
45,A_Different_Drummer,IMDb score too low..,8,27 April 2014,"Are you a fan of ""versus"" films? They have a long history in Hollywood. FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN in 1943 wasn't the first, but it was a blockbuster at the time and the idea has been beaten death both in comedies and horror ever since. Usually but not always this is the last desperate gasp before the entire franchise burns out, but you never know. One of my personal favorites, for example, is AVP, or Alien Vs. Predator. The original was bloody brilliant and the sequel (yes these things have sequels) terrible beyond description. This film, FVJ, looks like it got a raw deal from the reviewers. First look at the awards section on the IMDb main page -- nominations and wins both. Next look at the number of reviews. As I have said before, bad movies don't generate this much passion. The story is clever, allowing the ""sacrificial teens"" so common to these stories to have prominence at the top of the script, and then letting them fade to the sidelines just as the two REAL stars, Freddy and Jason, grasp that (just like in Highlander) ""there can be only one."" Overall, rollicking good fun.",Freddy vs. Jason
46,CuriosityKilledShawn,In retrospect...not that great.,7,29 April 2004,"It was never going to be an easy film to make, considering how many years and changes it suffered in development hell. When it first came out my review was kind of biased as I was really excited at seeing Freddy and the J-Man finally do battle. But now, some months after its release, I can see some BIG faults in the script and direction. First of all, there is simply far, far, FAR too much set-up and exposition. There is scene after scene after scene of dull characters talking and some truly awful and awkward dialogue. There are long periods of virtually nothing happening in which the film seriously threatens to keel over and die! The acting is abysmal (with the exception of the Linderman character) and I've never seen a worse actor than Jason Ritter. He's completely wrong for the part and only James Marsden rivals him in terms of absolute expressionlessness.For a film called Freddy vs Jason we shouldn't be given a sub-sub-Scooby Doo plot and the same-old, same-old story. This film features yet another, endless 'Freddy's Boiler Room' sequence. Honestly, we have had ENOUGH of these! Freddy vs Jason was a chance to give us something new and exciting and dynamic. But a lot of this opportunity was thrown away.
Harry Manfredini (who's score was rejected) is replaced by Graeme Revell). Now, I've liked some of Revell's stuff (his music to Bride of Chucky was great) but here he passes on the chance to give us something incredible. Instead he has cranked out a generic and homogenised 'horror' score, complete with crashing noises and horrid sound-effects. Only in a few places does it prove how cool it could have been with a few moments of inspiration.
Ronny Yu's direction is stylish and he brings a sophisticated look to the film. But he simply fails to bring any life to it. Only in the last 10 minutes (when Freddy and Jason FINALLY do battle) does the film live up to its name. It's no surprise that I only watch these 10 minutes whenever it goes into my DVD player. And another thing. One character being harmlessly startled by another to a sudden burst of noise on the soundtrack in order to cheaply scare the audience is NOT cool. It was done to absolute stone-cold death in the (thankfully) brief slasher-revival of the late-90's. How on earth Ronny Yu thought it was acceptable to have this terribly dated and pathetic mechanism worked into the movie is a huge insult to intelligent movie-goers. It only proves Freddy vs Jason is an absolute no-brainer, designed to appeal to the masses. Strange considering only fans of the franchises will tolerate the boring plot.There are good points tho. Jason Voorhees is now played by a new guy, Ken Kirzinger (replacing the once great but now dreadful Kane Hodder), who brings a whole new level of power and coolness to the character. And Robert Englund is, once again, very energetic and irreplaceable as Freddy Krueger. But these dudes are only onscreen together for a few minutes (rendering the title and the film almost completely redundant). I blame the script. There were literally dozens of reject ideas for this movie and I reckon they chose the wrong one. Very, very little happens in this film and suffering 90 minutes of coma-inducing set-up is hardly worth the wait to anyone outside of Freddy and Jason fans.The DVD looks great. The 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is immaculate and really shows off what a DVD is capable off. The sound only comes in Dolby 5.1 EX. The DTS option was dropped in favor of a fullscreen version of the movie (honestly, what intelligent movie fan actually WATCHES these). Thankfully, the Dolby track is very strong, with many uses of the surround channels and.1 LFE. The Region 3 (which I also have) edition comes with a DTS track and it's even better. There are an abundance of features but only some of them are interesting. The deleted scenes are slightly interesting but there are still some cuts scenes not featured.A good DVD of a shockingly average movie. If the sequel ditches the moronic plot and cuts down on the lifeless characters then it has a better chance of being the movie we really want. Please Ronny Yu, next time less Scooby-Doo story and more ACTUAL Freddy vs Jason.",Freddy vs. Jason

48,Bored_Dragon,Nightmare the 13th,6,19 August 2018,"Being dead is not a big problem to Freddy Krueger. The trouble is that he's forgotten. He awakens Jason and sends him to Elm Street to kill a couple of teenagers, so that people think that Freddy has returned and that, fed by their fear, he could really come back. A good plan, but there's a catch. Once he starts his killing spree, Jason can not be stopped, and Krueger must personally get rid of the competition.After ten ""Friday the 13th"" movies and seven ""Nightmares on Elm Street"", Jason and Freddy are finally face to face, and I think that was a really excellent idea. Unfortunately, its realization is nowhere near that excellent. Although the idea had really great potential, the result is just another in the row of mediocre Jason/Freddy slashers. The only thing that makes this film stand out from its predecessors is an incomparably higher budget, the consequences of which are more than obvious. Good camera and directing, and the effects and production are far ahead of all its prequels. As far as the story and acting are concerned, there is no improvement. But nobody watches these franchises in search of quality cinema anyway, but for a good entertainment. Although I think it could have been much more fun, and it's not even close to ""Jason X"", it's certainly better than the most of ""Friday the 13th"" franchise.6/10",Freddy vs. Jason
49,jacobjohntaylor1,a horror masterpiece,9,16 June 2015,This is a very scary movie. I can think of scarier movie. A nightmare on elm street 3 the dream warriors is scarier. A nightmare 4 dream master is also scarier. A nightmare on elm street 5 is also scarier. Freddy's dead the final nightmare is also scarier. W.e.s Craven's new nightmare is also scarier. Friday the 13th III is also scarier. Friday the 13th the final chapter is also scarier. Friday the 13th VI Jason lives is also scarier. Friday the 13th VII the new blood is also scarier. Friday the 13th VIII Jason takes Manhattan is also scarier. Jason goes to hell the final Friday is also scarier. Jason X is also scarier. But still this a true horror masterpiece. I can think of some early A nightmare on elm street movie and some early Friday the 13th movie that this movie is scarier then. Mind you I would not call these movie terrible. I know some of then are favorites for a lot of people. I can understand that these are good just not as good as this one. This movie is scarier then A nightmare on elm street (1984). It is also scarier then A nightmare on elm street 2 Freddy's revenge. It also scarier then Friday the 13th (1980). This movie is also scarier then Friday the 13th 2. This movie is also scarier then Friday the 13th V a new beginning. This is a great movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. Freddy is a ghost and Jason is zombie. So I consider this a horror fantasy. This movie is very intense. 2 horror icons battling each other. This movie is a most see.,Freddy vs. Jason

Jason!,7,3 March 2004,"After as many as 10 films in the Friday the 13th franchise with the unstoppable monster known as Jason Voorhees and after several A Nightmare on Elm Street films with Freddy Krueger it was only a matter time that these two horror icons would clash against each other!Freddy vs. Jason is a good movie. I say its about average. It has very good acting from Robert Englund! Ken Kirzinger was very good as the famous slasher! Good music by Graeme Revell! Fantastic action and really incredible battles between the two maniacs! The film has just about what every fan wants like horror, fighting, and blood. Though I could do without the small nudity and sex scenes in this and just about in any film for that matter. I say its about average because I didn't think it was scary and yet it was gory but I feel the blood and stuff didn't look as realistic due to it being CGI and not like the old days. I'm not saying I have something against CGI which it is great for movies especially monster film but in this movie's case the effects just wasn't realistic but then again this could make the film even more watchable for the ones who are not gore fans. Well, I think most fans of both Jason and Freddy will love this one especially since they really fight hard! Recommended for the fans of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees!",Freddy vs. Jason
51,johnnyboyz,Thoroughly disappointing as a horror film and not much better as an action film either.,3,25 June 2007,"Having only seen the first Nightmare on Elm Street but, admittedly, none of the Friday the 13th films; I remained adamant I'd be able to make some sense of Freddy vs. Jason. As it turned out, I couldn't make any sense of it anyway but I wasn't confused in the way I had predicted.Freddy vs. Jason really is the pits in terms of film-making. I know there's a lot of bashing going on aimed at the state of the horror genre these days but I find it oddly ironic that the re-inventor of the 'slasher' horror film (Wes Craven following 'Scream') has had one of his and cinemas most original filmic creations (Freddy Kruger) absolutely butchered in a film that asks very few questions yet demands so many answers.The film likes excess; the film likes excess a lot. Blood, gore and insides of human beings being a reoccurring element but it also likes excess amounts of other things: rain, male characters yelling, female characters screaming in fact there are just so many instances of these things happening that I actually found myself laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it all. I mean, there are only so many ways to stab and kill someone.After an, quite literally, opening thirty minutes of hack 'n' slash where some sexually active teens get to see what some of their lower body organs look like, the film attempts to settle down into a nice groove of detective/who dun it: the only thing is, the police think they know who has done it (since the murders took place on Elm Street) and the teens have a go at cracking it themselves when the police refuse to give them any information who they think it is. Needless to say, it isn't long until the kid's dreams give them all the clues they need and this is where Freddy vs. Jason dangerously comes close to playing out like the first Nightmare on Elm Street film.Thankfully, instead of going down that route  it veers off and focuses on a character whom goes by the name of Jason Vorheers; the very same Jason from the Friday the 13th films. Now, even though I am oblivious to these films and this character; I was given a little introduction and half way through; a dream flashback sequence telling me how Jason became the way he is. There's also the inclusion of his mother which makes me immediately think of Norman Bates from Psycho and the influence his mother had on him so I can understand at a primitive level where the filmmakers are coming from with this character.Another thing about the character of Jason I liked are his traits. Any scene in which Jason appears is a good scene; not only because the action and violent set pieces are kind of fun but he resembles a strong, silent, deadly psycho sort of a killer whereas Freddy is just full of inane, un funny dialogue that he spouts when he's doing his evil act  a far cry from the Kruger we knew in A Nightmare on Elm Street. This made me want to 'root' for Jason as he was also especially good at eliminating annoying sexually active, pot smoking, American teenagers  if you're going to be good at one thing in a film; be good at that.The film may have all these characters in it, jumping around and yelling at the prospect of getting decapitated but at least they got Jason right  however one character out of about twenty one isn't good enough. The film's climax is more akin to that of a B-movie: there are over the top fight scenes, cheesy dialogue, horrid rock music spewing out as each titan clashes swords with one another and of course our old friend Mr. Excess has shown up and he's bearing all the blood and guts he's able to.I was told after seeing this that it was a film 'for the fans'; a film that was made for fans of the two films whom 'just wanted to see who would win' which is probably why there is no definitive ending just like in 'Aliens vs. Predator' but if we're using this idea of 'just to see who would win' for a film then I hope Hollywood are reading as in the next film, I'd like: Terminator vs. Robocop vs. Alien vs. Judge Dread vs. Predator vs..................",Freddy vs. Jason
52,filipemanuelneto,The Swan Song,1,29 June 2018,"This film is the eleventh sequel to ""Friday the 13th,"" a franchise that has long been held only thanks to the stubbornness of the studios, producers and directors, as well as the good amount of money it usually collects at the box office.Directed by Ronny Yu, the film has a script from Damian Shannon and Mark Swift. I am sure that these gentlemen will have little to be proud of, since this script is no more than a shame. The main idea is basically a crossing between ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" that is, face-to-face, in tight rivalry, Jason and Freddy Krueger.

This film at least delivers what it advertised: mindless murder, hyperbolic guts and gore, little sense of logic, poor scripting, nude girls, and a big match-up between the two monsters. Yawn! Panning the film is just too easy for me to go on too much longer. As a fan of the horror genre from silents to today, it always bothers me when people call these ""monsters"" the classics. Far from it. These monsters are nothing more than carbon copies of each other with different surroundings and each with a string of sequels that degenerate into even worst uses of celluloid. The film's one saving grace is that it does not try to take itself too terribly serious at all, and Robert Englund does have some witty thrust and perry here and there. What's next?

55,Fella_shibby,"Freddy's boiler room wrestling match with Jason is epic, specially the scene where Freddy hits Jason's traps with his elbows.",8,21 May 2020,"I first saw this years back on a dvd which I own.
Revisited this recently since I am on a FT13 marathon.
The events of this film takes place aft Jason goes to Hell aka The Final Friday n we r supposed to omit Jason X.
Seeing Jason in hell, Freddy takes this as an opportunity.
Since he is rendered powerless n not able to harm any kids in Springwood cos nobody remembers or utters his name, he disguises himself as Jason's mother n orders him to kill teens of Springwood so that he regains his power.
This film has lots of body count n it is full of action.",Freddy vs. Jason

Sure, the titular fight & some of the dreams provide some fun, but it takes way too long to get to it. Until then, we're bombarded with horror clichés (closed medicine cabinet reveal), mysterious rules that the dumb kids figure out ridiculously easily, & dated offensiveness (homophobia, sexism, racism).",Freddy vs. Jason
57,insomniac_rod,"It's excellent for fans, but it's just another Horror movie.",10,1 August 2006,"I've been waiting three long years to review this movie. I've been a fan of the series since the 80's and I was very, very excited when in 1997 and t.v. news there was a rumor about an upcoming fight between Jason and Freddy. When this came out I bought tickets for the premiere, I watched my VHS Friday the 13th movies, I even burned a CD with Friday the 13th movies related music. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie in all the world. Sadly, I was blind enough not to notice that my favorite movie character was involved in a PG-13 movie disguised as R with the post ""Scream"" influence that I hate the most. But let me finish my experience. I was very excited and my dream finally came true. Jason was fighting Freddy Krueger in Elm Street! There was blood, the machete, the mask, the claw, etc. It was like one of the most important moments in my life as breathed Friday the 13th movies for years. Now, without the anxiety and adrenaline, I have to be objective with the movie. The movie feels like ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" sequel with the Jason character. We all know about the issues between Paramount and New Line but it's obvious how New Line had preferences for Freddy. Anyways, the plot is the best they could think of. I mean, they thought about the possible ways to show a connection path between both characters. I can't blame the writers; they did what they could. The acting is decent but I sincerely miss the dumb teens from the 80's. The f/x and gore is pure brilliance. This movie has tons of blood and violence as we , the Friday fans love. The fights between Jason and Freddy are really great but that's where the producers took advantage of the naive fans like me. Even if the fights were minimal I'd still love them just for the fact that Jason and Freddy would be fighting! I mean, they could've just put both characters without doing anything and still I'd be pleased. Not only me but thousands of fans. The producers put little effort in the movie but it was enough to please the die hard fans of both franchises. This is in fact a dream come true for die hard fans of the series, but face it, it's far from being a good Horror movie. This movie is dedicated only for fans!I gave it 10 out of 10 because I can't deny my fanaticism towards the Friday the 13th and ANOES movies. Damn execs. at New Line they found their gold mine with this movie and they know that we will spend on the future sequels. This is a piece of pop culture whether you like it or not.",Freddy vs. Jason

Meanwhile, Will (Ritter) and his friend escape from a psychiatric hospital and learn that Freddy is up to his old tricks. Will tries to help his girlfriend, Lori (Keena) who starts having nightmares of Freddy and they try to stop him. As the body count grows, Freddy and Jason go at odds with each other since there's not enough room for the both of them.

It's certainly not to be missed by any die hard ""Friday The Thirteenth"" or ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" fans but I think while they'll enjoy it they'll be slightly disappointed at the same time. Robert Englund (Freddy) returned for this film and was as outstanding as ever, as was the case with Ken Kirzinger (Jason). Kelly Rowland was surprisingly good in her role of Kia Waterson and so was her co-star Monica Kenna playing Lori Campbell.

Who would ever thought that these two super-serial killers would ever face each other off on the silver screen? It would take a great director to pull this one off. The producers found one, underrated film maker Ronnie Yu. He has the directing and visual style that it would take to make a watchable movie when these two movie giants go at it one on one.Freddy is tired of living in his own personal hell. He decides to come back and terrorize a whole new generation of children. But he needs someone to do it. After searching for the right candidate he finds one. A sleeping Jason who's finally found a resting place. But his feeble mind is twisted by the fiendish Freddy who needs someone like him to pull off his demonic scheme. Will he be able to pull this one off? Can Jason keep Freddy at bay. What will happen when these two finally square off? Who will win? To find out you'll have to watch the ultimate show down, Freddy vs. Jason!!A wild film that will either entertain you you leave you scratching your head. This film is for fans only. If you don't care about either character then you wont enjoy this films. But Ronnie Yu not only manages to keep the movie following but he creates an atmosphere for these movie monsters.

63,kevin_robbins,It leaves you wanting more and feeling a bit unfulfilled,6,8 May 2021,"Freddy vs Jason (2003) is another movie I watched for the first time in a long time from my personal collection. The storyline focuses on Freddy being too weak to return to Earth so he leverages his powers to awaken Jason and do his killing for him. Freddy plans to return to Earth, dispose of Jason, and start another killing spree of his own. This movie is directed by Ronny Yu (Bride of Chucky) and stars Robert Englund (A Nightmare on Elm Street), Monica Keena (Dawson's Creek), Kelly Rowland (American Soul), Jason Ritter (W.), Paula Shaw (Reindeer Games) and Zack Ward (Transformers). I remember seeing this in the movies when it first came out and watching it again I had a lot of the same emotions as I did when I watched this in 2003. The storyline for this is a bit long for the amount of action it has. There are long lulls in the movie with a lot of high school dialogue and it takes way too long for Jason to face Freddy (which happens at the very end and then the movie is over). There were some cool kill scenes, I loved when Kelly Rowland was talking smack to Freddy only to have Jason standing right behind her. There was definitely some moments that make you cheer (cornfield scene as an example); but overall, it leaves you wanting more and feeling a bit unfulfilled. Is it a fun movie to watch? Sure. Should it have been better? Definitely. I'd score this a 5.5/10.",Freddy vs. Jason
64,atinder,I for one had fun watching this movie.,7,21 December 2009,"I for one had fun watching this movie.The plot Two of the most remembered eighties slasher film icons finally clash together, film fans have long been awaiting. Trapped in Hell when the authorities of Springwood manage to erase all evidence of his existence (and thus the fear that gives him his power), nightmare spirit Freddy Krueger comes across the soul of the equally infamous Camp Crystal Lake mad slasher, Jason Voorhees. Taking the guise of Jason's mother, Freddy resurrects him and commands him to start terrorising Springwood, hoping to instill enough fear that the name Freddy Krueger gets out again so that the ensuing panic makes Freddy strong enough to return a seventh time. The plan works, but Freddy soon discovers that Jason, true to his nature in the past, will not stop killing, and is taking each of his victims. Determined to retake his position as the most feared killer in Springwood, Freddy devises a plan to sedate Jason into unconsciousness in order to battle him to the death. In the meantime, a small band of survivors who learn what's happening make their own efforts to not only ensure Jason's victory, but to return him to Camp Crystal Lake. The most of the movie is good but Some scenes were bit over the top.like when Jason was getting tossed like a rag doll which I did not like the ending was a little disappointed.I did like Jason Kills in this movie was really good gory deaths scenes (4ponit for that).Freddy Dreams had some really Creppy moments (3 Ponits for this).Acting from everyone was really good.

65,JoeB131,A Monster Mash (UP),5,10 January 2013,"Not since Frankenstein was forced to team up with the Wolfman has there been a more naked attempt to cash in on two waning horror franchises.The problem with this movie is that these two monsters really don't belong in the same universe. Freddie was a smart monster who killed smart, likable kids. Jason was a dumb monster who killed dumb, horny kids.So the plot is that the town of Springwood, which was much closer to Crystal Lake then we ever thought, has beaten Freddie by erasing all record of him and committing all the kids who knew about him to an asylum. A weakened Freddie resurrects Jason to go kill some teenagers so everyone remembers who Freddie was.Everything else in the plot is to get the two monsters in a battle royal at Camp Crystal Lake, which had some decent fight choreography.But since we know after a combined 17 movies, neither of these monsters can actually be ""killed"", it' kind of hard to get excited over the outcome.Additional problem.

66,drqshadow-reviews,A Shaky Bridge Between the Two Franchises: Spiritually Fitting but Generally Underwhelming,4,31 October 2016,"At this point, who really cares about continuity, I guess. Jason's survived being blown to bits by a SWAT team, boiled in toxic waste, drug to hell by demons and disintegrated in the atmosphere. Freddy's been crushed, impaled, pipe bombed, stripped of his powers and forgotten. It isn't the first time we've set aside preceding stories for the sake of the next one, and in this case it's given a pass for the sake of a titular clash of legends. Only they don't actually clash until the final twenty minutes, and even then it's a bit underwhelming. Their heavyweight brawls deliver a few brief moments of awesome, but there's always something restraining these monsters, holding them back from really cutting loose, and the big climax is predictably open-ended. In keeping with both franchises, most of our story revolves around a tribe of empty-minded teens. Slowly, prophetically unraveling the plot, their numbers are whittled down until a pair of strong-willed survivors finally decide to fight back. The greater saga is a bit over-reaching, introducing and abandoning several pointless subplots, but it does a fair enough job of intertwining two distinct franchises and granting legitimate reasons for Freddy and Jason to cooperate and, later, throw down. It's trashy fun, loaded up with fan service and gruesome killings. Big and dumb and cringe-worthy, spiritually compatible with both legacies, and basically all it needed to be. I've seen much worse.",Freddy vs. Jason

68,parry_na,Mild Spoilers ...,6,7 March 2016,"Very much in the spirit of early team-ups that begun with 'Frankenstein meets the Wolfman (1942)' (with Jason as the lumbering Monster and Freddy Krueger as the more lithe, even sinewy Wolfman – and it maybe coincidental, but their fiery 'demise' on a boardwalk is reminiscent of the Monster's final death in the Universal films, namely 1948's 'Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein') 'Freddy vs Jason' is enjoyable very much as a 'romp', which makes it surprising to me that we are reminded quite graphically of Freddy's penchant for juveniles. (""Freddie's coming. He loves children, especially little girls."") Firstly however, we are introduced to the usual array of teens, vile in every way except cosmetic – after all, this is a 'celebration' of Freddy/Jason films, so it wouldn't do to miss out on this particular staple. Some have returned from a previous entry, others are a new breed of laconic vacuousness; more ghastly than either of the titular monsters, it isn't long before they are despatched, one by one, to the relief of much of the viewers.Considering Freddy had assumed increasingly jocular and bizarre brief alter-egoes over the many sequels, he is, if anything, comparatively restrained here; apart from outsized shadows, he appears as a drug induced caterpillar, but that is the only concession to his wilder, younger days.Of course, we really want to see the two Big Names fight. And fight they do, in a series of terrific set-pieces. Krueger is frustrated by Jason killing Freddy's victims before Freddy does, and violence erupts between them, first in the dream world where Freddy resides, and then in reality. The self-mocking tone of earlier scenes is replaced with good old fashioned (or new fashioned, as there are plenty of CGI enhancements) fisticuffs. After many scripts were rejected for this, it seems the producers were more than happy with a thin, straight-forward knock-about instead of the more spectacular, intricate ideas originally discussed.Neither Jason nor Freddy are victors, and yet perversely they both are – however, this is their last throw of the dice to date. It would be seven years before another Freddy film was attempted, but this was a spineless remake of the 1984 original and offered nothing new.",Freddy vs. Jason
69,Chris_Docker,welcome back Freddy - all is (almost) forgiven - at least for this above average sequel,7,16 August 2003,"Horror films went through something of a decline with overly self-referential comedy, over-use of CGIs, and a determination to mark the rating certificate down to ensure a teenage audience. What resulted was a lack of shocks and real gore, reduced nakedness and predictable pulp. Freddy vs Jason goes some way to reversing that trend and even pays tribute to old horror classics where two super-evils battled it out. Don't expect a serious movie  don't go and see it if you are not up for gratuitous nakedness to get the adrenalin up just before the killer strikes, or prolonged flesh-gouging, or senseless violence, or snappy editing designed to get you jumping like there's electric shocks in the cinema seat.  If you're ok with that  read on. Freddy (Nightmare on Elm Street) has lost his power as no-one remembers him and consequently no-one dreams about him (his power over people is through their dreams). So the evil Powers that Be bring Jason (Friday the 13th super-slasher guy) back to life so he can work up a little fear in the neighbourhood. It works a treat, except Jason doesn't know when to stop and Freddy gets a little jealous. An interwoven plot draws some threads together and is substantial enough to maintain the interest necessary for suspension of disbelief. The final showdown is classic and well worth the wait. Not a major milestone, but a cut above most of the Elm Street' and Friday' sequels.",Freddy vs. Jason

71,drownnnsoda,Ridiculous Fun.,7,30 July 2006,"""Freddy Vs. Jason"" is a sequel to both the ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series. In this installment that ties two movie together, razor-clawed Freddy Krueger becomes powerless in his slaughter rampage because the Elm Street kids are on a drug that keeps him from entering their dreams. So, he consults hockey-masked killer Jason Voorhees to do the killing for him until Freddy can get back in control. But Jason is just as blood thirsty as Freddy, and won't stop killing the innocent teens. Now it seems a battle is about to rise, between two of the most maniacal murderers in movie history, and a group of teenagers on Elm Street are caught up in the middle of this bloody battle.It's obvious that any true fan of the ""Nightmare"" or ""Friday"" series will see this, regardless if it's a good movie or a piece of garbage. Ronny Yu (director of ""Bride of Chucky"") gives a fresh direction to the picture, but the ridiculous storyline overpowers any of the strong points in the movie. I mean what were they thinking? Freddy versus Jason? It's a little bit ridiculous if you ask me, they should have left the killers in their own series instead of creating a ""battle"". But despite that, the movie does have some okay performances and enough violence to please all of the gore-fans. But even still, this really is just your chop and slash horror flick and really isn't that special. While it may be entertaining, it is far from perfect and the idea of having two serial killers from completely different movies battle each other - eh.Bottom line - die-hard fans of either series should surely see this, just because they are fans of the series, that's why I saw it (although I'm a bigger fan of the Friday series than I am of Nightmare).

The performances are pretty run of the mill typical horror flick teen performances, not anything award winning here but I wouldn't say it's exactly it's Razzie worthy either. The gore and violence is pretty strong, then again what did you expect? It is Freddy Kruger and Jason Vorhees. So gore fans will be pleased, the issue here is that the blood factor takes higher precedent over the actual story, I'm not asking for a best picture Oscar winning film, but I feel like they didn't take full advantage of the opportunity they had. I think the movie could've been a lot more interesting than what it turned out to be. This movie is really just very iffy in many ways, there is nothing to set it apart from other horror movie entries. I don't know, maybe hardcore Freddy and Jason movie fans will like this, but I think some part of them will be kinda disappointed. It's not awful, but it's not great or really entertaining. 5/10, could've been a good bit better.",Freddy vs. Jason

75,JoeKarlosi,Freddy vs. Jason (2003) ***,7,11 February 2013,"It has taken me a long time to settle in and write down my feelings about the values of this long-anticipated Monster Mash. I am in the Jason Camp, a longtime ""Friday the 13th"" follower. When New Line Cinema finally acquired the rights to Jason in 1993 and I saw Freddy Krueger's gloved hand make a cameo appearance in JASON GOES TO HELL, I literally screamed out an ecstatic ""YEAAHHH!!!"" in my theater seat! AT LAST, after so many years of Paramount and New Line stalling on this project, Jason and Freddy were going to be starring in a movie together! My excitement also was an extension of my lifelong love for the old classic movie monster of bygone eras, and I had always loved FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN and KING KONG VS. GODZILLA. I sooooo wanted a 1990s equivalent of such a historically monstrous match-up! But little did I know in 1993 that my joy was going to be very short-lived. For while both movie bogeymen were now owned by the same studio, trying to come up with a feasible story was another issue entirely, as things would pan out. How do you take ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and pair it up with ""Friday the 13th""? Both franchises seemed so very different. FREDDY VS. JASON would be stuck seemingly eternally in ""Development Hell"" for TEN LONG YEARS. All sorts of desperate and silly story lines were proposed and rejected. But then along came director Ronny Yu and writers Damian Shannon and Marc Swift, who I think, came up with a highly workable scenario that was a smart way to have both characters figure into the plot line:As FREDDY VS. JASON opens, Freddy Krueger is enraged that the kids of Elm Street have forgotten all about him. Their parents keep them dependent on a drug called ""Hypnocil"", which prevents them from having bad nightmares and - consequently - keeps Freddy powerless to infect them. But then a brainstorm hits Freddy: he decides to search the bowels of hell itself and find someone scary enough who'll strike fear into their hearts again and force those kids to remember! And his search leads him to none other than one recently admitted inhabitant called Jason Voorhees. Freddy unleashes Jason back into the world, and the hockey-masked killer briskly slaughters enough people to make the Elm street kids panicky so that Krueger can now resume his reign of terror... the only faux pas Freddy encounters is, once Jason starts killing he can't stop -- and thus Freddy finds himself faced with his own monster which he has created -- and there's only room for one maniac killer in this town. The film functions more within a ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" framework, but even as a Friday the 13th Fan that's okay with me because it's the only real way to make it work. The mythology of both characters is respected, and the resulting match- up is better than it probably had any chance of being. When I first saw the finished product in 2003 I loved it; I initially even gave it a full four out of four stars. However, I've come down to Earth just a little with subsequent home viewings, and now I'd rate it ""Good"" (not ""Great""). Sure, the movie has got some poor acting from most of its teenaged cast. But the whole point of an exercise like this is mainly to concentrate on an excuse to get Freddy and Jason together in the same film for fans of either series, and beating the tar out of one another... and as such, it succeeds mightily in scratching that fanboy itch. The battle of the titans is very satisfying and there is enough dedication paid to both characters along with nods to both their origins that are interwoven into the story. Finally, the ending sequence -- which I shall not spoil here -- was just ingeniously ambiguous. *** out of ****",Freddy vs. Jason
76,TOMNEL,One of the best Nightmare and Friday the 13th films.,7,16 December 2007,"It's hard to know what to expect from these two horror series. Both have had mostly stinkers in their line of movies, but it seems some effort was put into this one. Any Freddy induced nightmare was well done, and scenes with Jason were very graphically gory, which fits with the series. It's better than I expected.Freddy tries to get Jason to kill the children of Springwood (home of Elm Street), and Jason goes bananas with the killing. Freddy gets angry when he tries killing kids and Jason beats him to the punch. Freddy and Jason have a battle to the death (though I believe both of them have died numerous times). It seems they really wanted these two villains to be menacing, because they are a lot scarier here than in any of the sequels. Freddy, has ditched most of his comedic ways, and instead of killing kids in ironic, humorous dreams, kills them in morbid, scary dreams. Jason goes around stabbing people with his machete...end of story. Jason, being a villain who doesn't talk, has to be extremely violent to keep the audiences attention, and Jason's kills are very bloody. A great positive about this movie, which is not true for most of the other Nightmare/Friday films is that the main characters are likable. Along with rooting for Freddy and Jason to tear each other limb from limb, you'll also be biting your nails hoping your favorite teen isn't massacred or caught in the crossfire.After watching this, I almost wish they'd make some more sequels to these two series, because this was a fun, tense, albeit somewhat stupid, way to spend an hour and a half.My rating: *** out of ****. 92 mins.

None of us knew then that one day, the powers to be in Hollywood would answer the question for the thousands of horror fans in the world. If you are looking for an edge of your seat, suspenseful horror film, this isn't it. Then again, if you want a horror film that you can laugh at, yell at the screen for being stupid, and just sit back and watch the pretty colors, this is the one! Don't think you're going to get a story driven movie. If you want to be wowed at the simple storyline and good special effects, Freddy Vs. Jason is the flick for you. And is it just me, or did every actor in this movie look like they could be some other (famous) actors stand in? I kept seeing moments of Jack Black, Jason Mewes, Britney Murphy, and John Saxson in here. Maybe they spent all the money in the budget on special effects, they couldn't hire a big name cast.",Freddy vs. Jason
78,Agent10,A step back in the horror genre,1,2 September 2003,"Nothing new. Nothing different. Just a bunch of blood and random teen stupidity dished out over a span of an hour and a half. Thus, this is what Freddy Vs. Jason is all about. Never mind the cliches and crummy acting, this film was just a travesty to the fact that is was ever made. People's dreams should really be haunted by the fact that this piece of crap somehow made it to the big screen, then made money in the process. I guess there is no hope for the human race when they willingly shell out money for something this boring and ridiculous. Well, here's looking forward to yet another stupid line of horror films.",Freddy vs. Jason
79,aidanratesmovies,What did you expect?,7,27 November 2020,"A solidly entertaining, and enjoyable little horror flick- Freddy vs. Jason can never decide if it is more of a parody or if it wants to actually take itself seriously, but in the end, it still provides for a decent viewing or at least what you could come to expect. The film is led in performances by the talent Robert Englund, his portrayal of Freddy more charismatic than ever. Ken Kirzinger also provides a decent performance as Jason, but obviously there is less to work with considering his circumstances, however he still manages to make it quite fun- although at times some of the things he does can be a bit ridiculous. The pacing is rather good throughout, I was decently entertained throughout the whole film, and although the look of the film isn't anything grand- the fight scenes between Jason and Freddy are quite fun to watch, and easily the best parts of the movie. The acting besides its two leads is pretty awful, there are either completely over the top, stupid, or incredibly cliche. There are several plot holes throughout, as well as some things that just plainly make no sense. But if you are able to turn your mind off for a little while and just try to enjoy it, the film can be pretty entertaining, and pretty fun for any horror fan to enjoy.

80,truemythmedia,Exactly As Advertised,4,30 October 2019,"Finally, a horror movie I can get behind! Enough with the artsy crap like ""Hereditary"" or ""The Witch"". I like my horror movies to be brainless, soulless slaughter-fests with more bodies piled up at the end than can fit in a county morgue.
Just kidding.
This movie is hot garbage, but I must admit I did enjoy it far more than I actually expected to. I think the reason that this movie partially worked for me (I still only gave this 2/5 stars) was because of the tone it took. This movie has an absolutely ludicrous plot, and it takes full advantage of it. This movie was never going to win any awards, nor was it trying to do so. What this film was trying to do was entertain a loyal fanbase; both Freddy (""A Nightmare on Elm Street"") and Jason (""Friday the 13th"") have spawned their fair share of horror sequels (Freddy currently has eight films, and Jason has twelve). I, personally, have actually enjoyed some of the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Again, none of them are award winning, but as Freddy uses nightmares to kill people, those films have a kind of pseudo-fantastical element to them that sometimes produces bizarre (and oftentimes humorous) results.",Freddy vs. Jason

I don't like it, but I will have to be precise.I saw Freddy vs Jason four times, which is the most times I ever saw a Jason movie. but that doesn't mean it's a good film. it BEEPs so bad, the performances are weak, the story BEEPs, the battle is unfair (Jason and Freddy? come on! that's no match), the soundtrack is poor. yes, I can say without a doubt this movie brought me more misery than joy or fear.",Freddy vs. Jason
82,Samiam3,"When the gore gets tough, the tough gets gory",7,13 June 2009,"Whatever the intention of Freddy Vs Jason is (making money, entertaining fans), It works somehow. Of course there is nothing scary about watching the two horror legends continuously stabbing and slashing at each other gushing fountains of blood, but it's fun. It has been four years since Freddy Krueger has made headline news. A police cover up has caused a reduce in nightmares, which has subsequently drained him of his power. In order to recover, he must strike fear into people, so he tricks Jason Voorhees into doing his dirty work, which he will then take credit for. The plan backfires, and Freddy then goes after Jason. In the middle of the chaos are a handful of traumatized teenagers who are trying to save themselves and the neighborhood, by orchestrating a battle between the two in the hope that they will destroy each other.The movie is silly, but well shot, with some striking images, like Jason coming out of a cornfield ablaze with the flames tinting the sky pink, or the fire from an explosion lighting up Crystal Lake blood red. I have to admit that Freddy and Jason are an excellent match. Freddy has got speed, agility and supernatural powers while Jason has super strengh and a body that cannot be bruised or broken. Freddy vs. Jason is not as bad as the critics say it is. Sure it's dumb, but there is guilty pleasure to be had here.",Freddy vs. Jason

So if you're going into it expecting to see Gone with the Wind or whatever, then you need to get a new freaking brain transplanted inside your little head. I have no idea why this movie is ranking under a 6 on this website. People are just dumb, that is all I'm going to say. This movie is entertaining, scary in the right places with a touch of humor and a ton of action. The first ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie is universally loved masterpiece. Then all the other Nightmare movies came out and Freddy became a clown. This movie gives him back his self respect and people have a problem with it? Whatever. Jason is awesome too. I think the hardcore Jason fans have a problem with them changing the actor. The director needed a bigger guy, get over it. The director was smart enough to change something to make the movie work, to give us a better movie. Anyway, this movie is a great way to introduce people to Freddy or Jason. More than worth a watch. Check it out.",Freddy vs. Jason
85,rosscinema,Just as bloody and just as dumb!,3,23 September 2003,"The idea was intriguing enough like ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" and in that film the makers kept to the original story. Here, they stick to the usual bloodletting from the sequels and only rarely strayed to the original stories. Story starts out with Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) sitting in hell and he can't get out because the teenagers of Elm street don't dream about him anymore. So Freddy has the idea of tricking Jason (Ken Kirzinger) into sending him back and starting trouble all over again. Once Freddy's name starts getting mentioned again he will grow stronger and return on his own. Jason does come back and starts killing everyone that comes into his path, especially teenagers! After Jason kills a few kids the friends of the dead start talking about who may have done it and Freddy's name starts to come up. Two teenage boys escape from the psychiatric ward and when they go back to their friends they find out that the drug they were forced to take prevents them from dreaming and that they were sent there on purpose. One girl named Lori (Monica Keena) finds out the mystery of her mothers death and now all suppressed dreams are out. Jason keeps killing and Freddy wants him to go away but that seems to be harder than originally planned. The film was directed by Ronny Yu who directed the fairly decent ""Bride of Chucky"" and while there are some scenes of camp value this pretty much resembles your typical slasher flick. The teenagers are portrayed as so stupid and uncaring that when it's their turn to die you feel like suppressing a cheer. Their is more blood in this film than 3 Jason or Freddy movies. It flows in buckets. John Ritter's son Jason plays Will and it's impossible to tell if he has any talent. These films were not made to showcase any acting talents! Just ask Johnny Depp, Kevin Bacon and Patricia Arquette. Monica Keena does come off the best and she does exhibit screen presence. She's a complete look alike for Brittany Murphy only with much bigger breasts. It is fun to watch these two fight it out but the characters are so damn stupid and of course the grown-ups are mean and even more stupid. I had the feeling while watching this that a real camp classic could have been made but the makers missed the opportunity. I won't tell you the end but don't be surprised if they make another one. Is Michael available?",Freddy vs. Jason

The casting and direction of this movie is pure cinema classicness. Robert Englund is the best Freddy ever, and Kelly Rowland shows her movie star power.",Freddy vs. Jason
87,eric262003,Epic Battle To Determine The Best Slasher Film Icons,8,22 October 2019,"It was a long time coming that we never thought we would would never see, but thankfully that moment had arrived. The battle between the most iconic slasher film monsters that took over the cinemas during the Halloween season during the 1980's finally will clash in a battle for monster supremacy while killing naive kids along the way. The Elm Street dream stalking demon sporting those terrorizing claws Freddy Kruger and the terrorizing fiend from Camp Crystal Lake with the mask who carries a machete will go to great depth to outdo one another and then clash for bragging rights to be crowned king of the monsters. Under the direction from Ronny Yu who in 1998 directed ""Bride of ""Chucky"" seems to be an admirer of 1980's slasher films as we slasher fanatics are treated to a double feature rolled into one package before the climax proceeds. And sure there's some origin stories for the younger audience who weren't allowed to the watch these movies back then, there is really little needed introduction for them anyway. They both do their familiar routine of killing teenagers. But the vast majority of attendees who'll see this movie are older fans of 1980's slasher films for the purpose of nostalgia over getting the spooks, but surprisingly, the graphic bloodbaths are twice as gruesome than the spook fests we see today.For those who like to see killings by the numbers will not be disappointed as the body count is quite impressive. The protagonist in the middle of the carnage is a young blonde girl named Lori Campbell (Monica Keena) who becomes the catalyst for uniting these two villains together. The idea of a town gathering its citizens to destroy this evil being has great creepy intentions to the likes of Freddy killing his victims in their sleep and telling wisecracks while doing it. It's a shame that the script could've been fleshed out a bit more as a plethora of ideas were right there in front of us. Instead we get the age old stalk and stab routine and then in last half hour comes the ultimate showdown of these evil icons.With his working expertise in the Hong Kong filming industry, Yu is able to make their climactic showdown filled with fantasy, plenty of macabre, but most of all full of entertainment. As surreal as it is, we couldn't care less. It was fun seeing Freddy beating around Jason in the boiler-room headquarters or Jason dismembering Freddy's limbs. The visual and special effects are handled with great precision and it truly makes up for the formulaic two thirds of the movie. And even though the motives behind Freddy and Jason will no longer generate shock value like they did in the 1980's, because as long as there's currency in their value, Hollywood will likely make another sequel, remake or reboot to their respective names. Who knows maybe a triple threat could be in the works with Robert Shaye founder of New Line Cinema we might see Michael Myers join the party and that will make people's heads spin. For Jason fans it's a step better than that awful ""Jason X"" and for the Freddy fanatics, it's at the same level as ""Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master"". Even though Wes Craven is not with us anymore, his creation could still make big bucks at the box office, but the dastardly duos best years are behind them.",Freddy vs. Jason
88,Sandcooler,Pretty awkward all in all,4,25 January 2008,"Back in the old days my nerdier friends would repeatedly state how cool it would be if Freddy and Jason, or in some alternative versions Jason and Michael would end up fighting each other. I'd usually say that it was pretty obvious why they weren't studio executives. I mean come on, this is not an idea or a script, this is just bad fan fiction. These two guys do not live in the same world. Seeing Jason at Elm Street is just really, really wrong. There's also way too much plot, and it feels like a chore getting through all this build-up you've already read about in the synopsis. I mean, everywhere I ended up reading this beast of a summary which pretty much describes the whole movie except for the ending, which I could deduce myself thank you. Throughout a thoroughly disappointing ninety minutes, we really just get a summary of what both series are about, only with actors that somehow got to be even worse than the original ones. Good Lord, is there anything Kelly Rowland can do better than Beyoncé? Was that really the most famous name they could get by the way, the other one from Destiny's Child? Not that the main actress is any better, but at least she's fun to look at. The killings are unimaginative and quite few in number. Well, a lot of people get killed, but few kills really stick. The most bothersome about the experience is probably just that the whole history behind our two main characters is told once again until you start yelling at the screen that you know all this crap, get to mindless slashing! The fight the title promised is pretty good though, only they don't really seem that evenly matched whether they're in dream world or in regular. At least it was messy.However, I'm pretty much missing the basic picture. Freddy and Jason are icons from the eighties, and there's no point in drowning them in the wave of redundant mass production teen horror we're getting these days. When done right they can still be of value to horror cinema(there are worse movies than ""Jason X"")but don't have them be around these ""Dawson's Creek""-rejects.",Freddy vs. Jason
89,Matt_Layden,"""Neither Freddy, Jason, or the Audience Win In This Film""",5,10 October 2005,"Two of the most notable slasher film icons finally clash together on film. Trapped in Hell and powerless because no kid fears him, Freddy Krueger comes across the equally infamous Camp Crystal Lake slasher, Jason Voorhees. Tricking him into killing the residents of Springwood, in hopes for the name of Krueger spreading, so that he can become the feared dream killer again. When plans go wrong and Jason starts killing all Freddy's victims, it becomes a showdown of horror icons as they battle for the championship of horror.Fans of each slasher genre have been waiting for this showdown ever since the claws of Freddy burst out through the ground and dragged Jason's mask into hell with him. That was ten years ago, so can a film with hype lasting over ten years be able to please both fans of Nightmare and Friday? Much like any versus movie, you have to please both fans of the genre. So when you go into this movie you get the feeling that there will be no clear cut winner, you don't want to get thousands of hate mail from all the Nightmare fans, or vice versa. So the ending will be a cop-out and have the fans debate over the real winner until the sequel comes out. Much like Aliens Versus Predator, we the audience get cheated as the two main characters, Freddy and Jason have to put up with stupid pointless characters...everyone else in the film.In reality Freddy Versus Jason is only a ten minute film, those ten minutes come at the very end of the movie, where it is actually Freddy fighting Jason. We unfortunately have to sit through the same old clichéd horror crap that we've been fed years and years before. In hopes for something new in this film, having two different horror icons battle it out, we get 80 minutes of boring, clichéd, crap and ten minutes of kick ass, edge of your seat cheering at the screen fun. My advice, see it with a friend and as them to wake you up when they are in the burning cabin.What is it with the new wave of horror films that must have a singer in it for no apparent reason, it started off with LL COOL J in H20 and Busta Rhymes in Halloween Resurrection, now the Myers virus has infect both Freddy and Jason as we get Kelly Rowland, who gives her first and let's hope, only performance on the big screen. I also believe that Kevin Smith should sue, for stealing the character of Jay, it seems that they are stretching for comic relief now. A tip for the sequel, more screen time for the icons, and less of the victims, we all know how it's going to end, so just give us what we want.To me it felt like they tried to make Jason are hero in this movie, more sympathy went his way, even the victims of the movie joined his side, to me that shows weakness in his character, he needed help to ""win"" the fight...and I use that term very loosely. Krueger on the other hand is more sadistic in his killings and this movie is more about him. When you walk into this movie, you obviously will pick a side in the battle, but at the end, both sides will feel the same, disappointment. Are the boring useless 80 minutes worth the money for the great ten minutes at the end? Well, I'll let you be the judge of that.",Freddy vs. Jason

91,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"70% Nightmare on Elm Street, 30% Friday the 13th, 80% dull",5,19 April 2014,"Basically just a Nightmare On Elm Street with Jason added into the mix, and I'm not a fan of Nightmare on Elm Street, sooooo, ....Far too polished for a slasher movie, far too much CGI, and far too much Nightmare On Elm Street, not enough Friday The 13th for me; this is probably at least 70% Nightmare on Elm Street, and 30% Friday the 13th.In a most convenient explanatory opening scene, we learn that Elm Street residents have been given drugs for years to make them forget about Freddy Krueger, so he resurrects Jason to remind them, knowing the killings will be blamed on Freddy, and hoping that will make the adults stop giving the teenagers the drugs to make them forget Freddy. But Freddy cannot control this Frankenstein's monster he has created, and Mr. Hockey Mask begins to kill whomever he wishes, in this long delayed crossover film, which, incidentally, was about as scary and frightening as stale popcorn at the cinema.Jason's makeup is incredibly lame, he's clad in what appears to be a burlap sack slung over his shoulders, and what is visible of his head looks like a basketball which has been turned inside out and painted black. Ken Kirzinger is completely lacking in any style or character as Jason, he's just a big guy in a hockey mask, standing around on his mark. During Jason's massacre in the cornfield, Kirzinger basically just walks around swinging his machete at random, while background extras run in front of the camera, only fall over, and CGI blood splatters. Not exactly inspired. Nor was the obligatory stoner guy (I'm so tired of this stereotype) Inconclusive, nearly pointless ending, coming off what feels like a 20- minutes long wrestling match between Jason and Freddy- (director Ronny Yu just simply didn't come up with a clear winner, instead putting it off onto us, the audience, to make sense out of his inconclusive, nearly pointless ending) only makes the entire effort feel worthless.Usually I don't comment about things which happened AFTER the film I'm commenting on was released, but I'll make an exception here: in the 2013 film, Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th, this film's director, Ron Yu, says, ""My philosophy is everything in the movie should set up for (sic) the ending"", alluding to the theory of Chekov's Gun - but nothing in Yu's movie set up the ending. It is largely just A Nightmare on Elm Street formula, with Jason in a co- starring role, leading up to a glorified wrestling match between the two. The producers hired this director who had never seen any of the previous films in either series, allegedly to get a new perspective on this film, but that only resulting in the hiring of a director who didn't know what to do with the material, and an actor is in the role of Jason who doesn't do much of anything in the role. Ritter does well, Keena is cute, but the material just isn't there.",Freddy vs. Jason
92,brando647,Whose side are YOU on?,7,27 April 2008,"Me? I chose Freddy Kreuger...Another fan-boy dream comes true: horror legends Freddy Kreuger and Jason Voorhees together in one film. Surprisingly, this one isn't too bad. Of course, it has it's flaws but the cons don't heavily outweigh the pros. I wouldn't say this was a ""great"" movie, but it was still fun to watch. I imagine it was a challenge for the filmmakers to create a storyline that encompasses both characters, but they did a decent job. The story finds Freddy Kreuger desperate to cause more mayhem on Elm Street but the residents have forgotten about him and, therefore, he is powerless. So, he enlists the help of Jason Voorhees to slay some hapless teens and bring the fear back to Elm Street. Unfortunately for Freddy, when Jason gets started, it's almost impossible to stop him.I will go so far as to say this is probably my favorite character crossover film so far. While the first 'Alien Vs Predator' film was ignorant and didn't build of the strong points of the individual franchises, it appears the filmmakers here actually seemed to know what they're doing. We're treated to some great kills (though not enough from Freddy, in my opinion) and a couple cool battles between the movie's headliners. We're given the opportunity to see them fight it out in each of their home environments, Freddy's nightmare-scape and Camp Crystal Lake. One of my favorite parts: in battling Freddy Kreuger, we are given a brief glimpse into the mind of Jason, which I thought was a cool addition. The fights are brutal and the kills are bloody. So, in essence, they got the feel of the movie right.The movie's weaknesses are the same you'll find in most horror/slasher films. The dialogue suffers from a good amount of corniness (i.e. ""That goalie was p***ed about something.""). The lame writing and weak acting from the victims were the only major annoyance. Kelly Rowland (formerly of the R&B group Destiny's Child) is almost painful to watch in her first major film role and Kyle Labine's performance as the stoner Bill Freeburg seemed like a terrible attempt at ripping off Jay from Kevin Smith's movies. In fact, the only actors that didn't grate on my nerves at some point were Robert Englund (of course), Ken Kirzinger, and Brendan Fletcher. The main protagonists, played by Monica Keena and Jason Ritter, had spouted enough lame dialogue that I was hoping Freddy or Jason would do me a favor and take them down.The film's effects were pretty impressive throughout with one exception...the ""Freddypillar"". There's a scene in which Freddy takes the form of a caterpillar, reminiscent of the caterpillar from 'Alice in Wonderland', and the CGI is blatantly obvious. Honestly, I feel they would've been better off using practical effects in that case. Fortunately, that's the only bit that didn't work. The rest of the visual effects in the film are great.It's by no means great cinema, but it still entertains. Fans of both franchises should walk away satisfied and, if they're anything like me, they're hoping for a sequel. I wouldn't mind seeing Ash from the 'Evil Dead' trilogy brought in to tackle them both.",Freddy vs. Jason

This is until, Freddy realizes that Jason isn't going to step aside easily, and must be taken down himself.So, this movie has everything. It plays every rule in the book, bad dialog, horrible story, unknown actors (apart from Robert Englund), a lot of gore, some sex and nudity, persuasive violence, and a lot of funny scenes! No wonder it was so fun to watch! When coming into this movie, don't expect any logical sense.So what can people expect? Well, there is certainly a great showdown of the two famous horror icons in the end. The special effects in here are done well, as well as the action. The laughs in here are funny but nothing too special. The violence and gore is painful, in a good way. It was all raw to the bone.The unknown actors do a good job in here as the dumb teens with ridiculous and sometimes tedious dialog. What else can I say?

Something entitled Freddy vs. Jason in which two of horror's retro titans go head to head is not going to be aiming high. That being said in the hands of Ronny Yu (Bride of Chucky) the movie is a creative, campy, fun party fest of a flick. It also does a commendable if unnecessary job of bringing their two universes together. But like other modern reboots it has trouble creating a likable base of victims. Monica Keena (Dawson's Creek) is pretty awful as our mostly useless final girl. Only Kelly Rowland (Destiny's Child) and Chris Marquette (Barry)manage to make a memorable impression. As for the big boys Robert Englund is dependably charasmatic as Krueger but Ken Kirzinger really adds nothing to the role of Jason except for an aggressive stature. The movie also stars Lochlyn Munroe (Scary Movie), cutie Jason Ritter (Raise your voice), Brendan Fletcher (RV), Kathryn Issabelle (Ginger Snaps) and sexy stud muffin Zack Ward (Christmas Story) star.

Freddy vs. Jason was the best film of the summer and based on it's opening of 36 million dollars and a final tally of more than 80 mill, it is safe to say that it delivered the goods.For anyone who doesn't know by now, the basic premise of the film is that Freddy Krueger can no longer invade the minds of Elm Street kids.  They have been taking a new anti dream pill and this prevents them from dreaming about anything, including Freddy.  Without their dreams, Freddy is powerless to live.  So he has to scour the depths of Hell to find something that will shake them up, something that will get them having nightmares again.  And of course that ""something"" is Jason Voorhees.  Now there is no explanation as to how Jason comes back to life, only that Freddy brought him back.  And he immediately starts to kill.  If you are looking for a plot in this film, you have come to the wrong place because they don't even pretend that there is one.  What we get instead, is blood, boobs, hysterically absurd characters and lots of fun.  In fact, I cannot remember having this much fun in the theater since I don't know when. Characters are introduced so the can die in this film.  We see plenty of sex scenes and the ensuing death scenes are violent, bloody and final.  This reminds me of an 80's slasher film.  Ronny Yu has given us all a subliminal wink wink as he delivers all the goods.  You have your standard stupid teens that party, get high and have sex before they die.  And this is just the first 45 minutes of the film.  The last 30-45 minutes of the film is all Jason and Freddy battling it out, icon vs. icon.  And when they meet for the second time, all frikking hell breaks loose and it is one of the most adrenaline induced scenes in any film of recent memory.  Freddy vs. Jason is truly a masterful film.  This is everything you could want in a movie like this.  One final note and that is the debate about the ending.  You would think that because Freddy helped build New Line into the powerhouse that it is today, Freddy would get preferential treatment over Jason.  Wrong you are. The very end of this film is perfect.  It ends on the note that it should and it just goes to show us once again how much Ronny Yu and New Line wanted to give the fans what we wanted.  I can't wait for the two disk DVD!!10 out of 10!!",Freddy vs. Jason
101,brchthethird,Delivers what you would expect and nothing more,6,14 November 2014,"This is mostly for fans of the Friday THE 13TH and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchises, and in that respect it does a serviceable job. It's not really scary, and there was only a couple of moments that made me cringe because of how gross they were (both thanks to Jason). It's filled with the requisite unlikeable, horny teenage characters and the adults who don't listen to them. That's what people have come to expect from these movies anyway: creative kills, and the movie does deliver there. What it doesn't really live up to is the promise of the title. I would have liked for more interaction between the two titular characters. Instead, we have to wait until the final act to see them duke it out. I guess the movie is a little bit of a disappointment, but it's entertaining enough to warrant seeing at least once.",Freddy vs. Jason
102,mentalcritic,"Mediocrity, incorporated...",5,27 July 2004,"Being the eighth episode for one series and the eleventh for another, you don't normally expect an ounce of creativity in a film like this. But it seems as though the people at New Line actually sat down and thought about how they'd tell a story. The second scene, in which Jason is brought back from the dead, gives one the frightful impression that we're in for a load of climax with no setup. Not so here. In fact, this is the first episode in either series since the originals that has any trace of creativity or proper exposition at all.In case you like surprises, consider this fair warning.The bad things first. Ken Kirzinger is totally wrong for the part of Jason. Granted, the role is played entirely silent, and his only requirement is to stand there and look menacing, but Ken doesn't accomplish that much. Any frontal shot of Jason played by Ken can be easily compared to one of Jason played by Kane Hodder, and the conclusion that this is one of the worst casting decisions made by the powers at New Line rings out like an alarm. One has to wonder whether Kane asked for too much money, because everything about Ken's performance screams ""low-rent"".The character of Kia was also a bad choice. In the film's quest to be ""hip"" or something, they should have realised that the only people who don't yawn and go scratch themselves when some young black actor tells the world how brilliant they think they are happen to be they themselves. Thankfully, the film acquits itself nicely in the end when Jason does what everyone who can read above a fourth-grade level wishes they could do when they are confronted by this self-satisfied idiocy. I stood up and cheered when this sequence was over. I would have paid good money to see Jason rip her head off and put it on a spike, in fact.The angle of teens being imprisoned and shot full of drugs would have been an excellent one to pursue. In the last two decades, psychiatry has gone mad, with any and all tendencies that someone doesn't like being labelled an illness, and the people displaying them pumped full of drugs or put behind bars. As a survivor of many sanctioned abuses, I would have loved to have seen this explored a little. Unfortunately, this plot element becomes almost completely incidental, and only serves to motivate the characters. Even worse is when Lori forgives her father for the Nazi-like abuses he has perpetrated simply because he was ""protecting"" her. I'm sure the comatose teen who your dad put on that table, and whose feet you're sitting at, would be touched, Lori.In the end, the film really should have been called Freddy, because the film is almost entirely about him. Not that we can blame the makers for this. The Jason we are shown here is about as charismatic and powerful as a dead rabbit. The ridiculous justification they ended up using for not casting Hodder was that they wanted Jason to look more ""human"". Excuse me? The inhumanity, or über-humanity, of the character is what defines him. He's supposed to look like he ate a lead football and passed a hail of bullets, New Line.In the end, this film gets a median five out of ten. All five points are awarded for one of the most satisfying on-screen slayings since Clarence was killed by RoboCop. The rest is just there. Next time, New Line, bring something new to the table. After all, that is what your name used to imply.",Freddy vs. Jason
103,jeremycrimsonfox,Good Crossover Between Two Horror Icons,7,9 April 2019,"Anyone who knows horror knows that Friday The 13th and Nightmare On Elm Street are two of the legendary horror franchises of all time. Freddy Vs. Jason is a crossover of the two films, and their last one before both received reboots, which were not well received (but made a lot of money in the box office, proving the series are still loved).In this film. Freddy Krueger is now powerless due to the people of Springwood forgetting him and erasing him from their memory, so to make them remember so he can regain his power, he revives Jason Voorhees to kill for him. While this starts off as a good idea, as it restores Freddy back to his full strength, he soon finds out that it won't stop Jason's killing spree, as this leads a group of teens on a mission to stop him, which involves discovering a police cover up involving past victims of Freddy being sent to a psychiatric hospital to be drugged as the reason the dream killer has revived the undead slasher of Camp Crystal Lake.So, yeah, it's a good crossover between two horror icons that has been in development hell since the 1980's. And yeah, while the kills are basically predictable, it's the suspense that made them good. The fight scene between the two are good, and the story is good. The only problem I have is the police cover-up subplot being used to strip Freddy of power, as I felt it took too much of the film's time. But still, it's a good film that is an improvement over Jason X.",Freddy vs. Jason
104,hnt_dnl,"Needed more actual ""Freddy versus Jason""!",5,21 August 2012,"I guess it had to come to this! The 2 most iconic ""teen horror-slasher"" killers of all time finally come face to face. In one corner, you have Freddy Krueger (from the Nightmare on Elm Street movies) and in the other, there's Jason Voorhies(from the Friday the 13th movies). The popular characters converge in this movie Freddy vs Jason (2003). While I always thought that Nightmare on Elm Street was the better series overall with the clever concept of a dream-killer, the Friday the 13th movies are still enjoyable as ""80s camp"". Hollywood has very recently churned out two terrible remakes of the original films, that don't even come close to measuring up.The meat of both franchises was made in the 80s, where the best and most memorable of these movies occurred. Both begrudgingly tried to drag the franchises into the early 90s, with little success. The movie world had tired of the teen slasher flick, until Scream in the mid-90s ushered in a new generation of stylistic, modern takes on the genre. There simply wasn't any room for more Jason and Freddy....Until this movie! The best parts of this movie are the battles between Freddy and Jason, which are few and far in between. But when they do converge for the first time, it is absolutely thrilling! The verbose, silver-tongued, playful Freddy against the mute, go-for-the-jugular, hockey-mask-wearing Jason. Robert Englund is as great as ever as Freddy, and Ken Kirzinger is appropriately malevolent as Jason.Unfortunately, the other parts are lacking. The other characters literally serve as glorified narrators/storytellers, as they all sound like the writers who made up this movie! The acting overall is pretty poor...not even a good comic relief character! It's hard to root for this group of teens as there's no real distinguishable personality to any of them. The 2 main stars Monica Keena (as the lead scream queen character Lori) and Kelly Rowland (of Destiny's Child fame and plays Lori's sidekick Kia) seem very out of their element; they try, but too hard. Jason Ritter (as Lori's institutionalized boyfriend Will), Chris Marquette (as Lori's admirer, the nerdy Charlie), and Brendan Fletcher (as Will's fellow mental ward escapee, the high-strung Mark) fare better and have character potential, but unfortunately, they are there just to support the female leads. Lochlyn Munro has a totally thankless role as Deputy Stubbs.Other than character, the movie had a real problem with editing, continuity, and logic. I know it's a teen slasher movie, but still! You'd think in a 21st century movie, they'd avoid mistakes in prior such movies. I don't even think some of the worst 80s movies had such editing snafus! There are way too many coincidences that seem literally thrown in just to forward the plot, but not to be logical. A character would be in one place one minute, then a few seconds later magically be in a new location in the same scene. A police car just randomly shows up at the exact house where there's been a killing. There's a really bad crash in the movie that defies all logic. It looks so bad, there shouldn't have been any survivors. No one was even shaken and there was nary a scratch on anyone! And how did these people cover so much ground (from the town Elm St is in to the mental institution to Camp Crystal Lake) in such a short time span? The dream sequences left something to be desired. The ones in the 80s movies still have a charm and creepiness with their old-school effects. The action scenes are the best, though, especially when the 2 true protagonists Freddy and Jason clash! Thus, the reasoning for me giving the movie a 5 out of 10. I just wish that I got to see more...you know?...FREDDY VERSUS JASON!",Freddy vs. Jason
105,Victor Field,"The movie may have the bodies, but no one seems to have the brains.",5,5 July 2005,"""You're crazy! You're both crazy! Jason just chops your head off and that's it, but Freddy makes you suffer first."" (American teenage girl arguing with two of her friends about which screen psycho they'd rather be killed by, with the other two plumping for the guy in the fedora and the Dennis the Menace sweater.) I've only seen one of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies, but I've seen all of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies; this eleventh Jason/eighth Freddy experience may well be one of the better of the former, but ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" is the most lacklustre screen escapade of Freddy Krueger since ""A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge."" Crossing over movie characters is even more problematic than doing it on TV shows (or doing it WITH TV shows - ""Rugrats Go Wild,"" anyone?); the stakes are higher and the success or failure is more public. This meeting of two horror icons isn't a total washout - we do at least get a face off between F. Krueger and J. Voorhees (although the movie wimps out in declaring an overall winner, obviously needing to leave the door open for yet another movie, or another pair of movies) - but while this shows conclusively that the man in the hat and the razors beats the man in the mask for inventive killings and wit, with Robert Englund excelling for the eighth time as Fred, the movie falls down with its plotting and human characters.The movie's need to wedge in both series' mythologies while at the same time giving it a story all its own makes it heavy on plottiness but light on scares, and one of the biggest strengths of the series (strong and likable female heroes... well, there was that useless guy Jesse in the second movie...) goes awry, thanks in part to Monica Keena never quite convincing as the imperilled girl with a secret; her big ""I want to see him die"" speech is especially bad. Giving better value are Katharine Isabelle as her sexy friend (who sadly, but still in one of the better moments, gets killed by Jason before Freddy can get her) and Kelly Rowland, who acts better in this movie than Beyonce Knowles has in everything she's ever been in; but it still basically becomes high concept with little or no follow-through - it comes over like a movie made because they could.Writers Damien Shannon and Mark Swift, director Ronny Yu and producer Sean ""Friday the 13th"" S. Cunningham should have heeded the counsel of writer L.M. Kit Carson; when ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part II"" was released he told USA TODAY that these kind of all-star team ups tend to not work because they cancel each other out. Shame that New Line Cinema had to prove him right.Best exchange: between new police officer Lochlyn Munro and Miss Isabelle after the first murder; ""You need some assistance?""

106,Fernando-Rodrigues,Easy-to-diggest movie for teenagers,6,27 January 2021,"It has clichés, stereotyped characters, plot holes (Jason is afraid of water? How come two kids escape the mental hospital, without nobody going after them? And they even return there, but it seems empty?! and many other details...), but the big deal here is that we get to see Freddy X Jason. Iconic, but this concept could've been better explored in another script.",Freddy vs. Jason
107,ODDBear,A good partnership,7,14 August 2005,"This teaming of two horror icons was an idea I found insanely silly when I heard about it, but to my complete surprise I actually enjoyed it. I'm more of a Jason fan rather than Freddy and I was pleasantly surprised to see the amount of screen time Jason was awarded, given that the Freddy Krueger films were all the more popular in the States.Of course the story here is paper thin, with completely disposable characters and some hilarious dialogue thrown in for good measure but this film has plenty of what counts the most; blood and gore. I particularly liked the way Jason returned to form, even nastier than before (that sequence by the bed, YIKES). Freddy is the wittier and gets some great lines to deliver, and Robert Englund is..., well, he just plain and simple IS Freddy and he doesn't disappoint.What also surprised me was the element of genuine old fashioned suspense that popped up at times. Some scenes here were downright creepy and very well played out. Respect goes to director Yu also for appearing to genuinely care for this subject matter, giving the fans exactly what they want, and more, I think. But of course the film does go a bit over the top in the end and sadly I thought the conclusion was a bit too silly.But overall I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, much more than I thought I ever would.",Freddy vs. Jason
108,phubbs,Freddy vs. Jason,7,30 January 2014,"Well it had to happen at some point and I was always game for it, finally the two supernatural death dealers clash. The only thing that instantly springs to mind when writing about this is when will I see 'Michael Myers' 'Pinhead' 'Ash' 'Leatherface' or 'Chucky' join in on this horror icon mash?.You'd think the plot behind this would be silly but it actually kinda works in my opinion. Freddy seems unable to get it up anymore, he can't scare kids because everyone has forgotten about him. So he hatches a plan that involves raising Jason from the dead to bring terror back into kids lives hoping they will assume its him. Unfortunately for Freddy, Jason gets carried away and is killing way too many and spoiling Freddy's catch, thusly a fight ensues.So yes just like 'AvP' this is merely an excuse to see two iconic characters fight, the only difference is this film sticks to its trusted formula and delivers plenty of carnage. Now I'm not saying this carnage is worthy of praise, lets be frank we've seen it all before, but at least you get what you expect with no beating around the bush.Its all about the kills, Freddy does what he does best with his creepy dreamy imagery whilst Jason stomps around and hacks teenagers up. There isn't anything particularly ingenious or original going on here, the teen kills aren't exactly new and fresh and the adults running around trying to solve the issue do exactly the same thing they always do. I guess the fun part is seeing Jason upset Freddy by taking fresh kills away from him and causing tension between the two, inevitably this does result in small touches of dark humour which is cool.Its definitely a much better looking flick than most of the previous incarnations, the productions values are clearly quite high as its all very glossy. My only concern was maybe a bit too glossy, could of done with a hint of grit or that classic low budget feel perhaps. For shame on the decision to use CGI blood spurts in a few places, that's not cool at all and a worrying modern trend. Also one or two moments in the heat of battle do become a bit too farcical for my liking, just loses its edge...not that it was overly scary in the first place of course.End of the day if you're not a fan of gory slasher flicks or you don't follow them much then this isn't gonna change your mind. On the other hand if you're a fanboy or like me you simply like the two franchises then I think you'll like this a lot. Bottom line all this is really is fan service, but surprisingly its much better than you'd think. Silly thing is both of these characters are basically invincible and can't be killed, you can do virtually anything to either of them and they will still come back. So in theory it can keep going forever which does make the whole premise kinda daft really, at no point was I ever thinking that one of them would actually win. We all know and accept this to a degree but it just makes the whole battle a bit pointless really, at least Jason didn't team up with the kids against Freddy, which it was slightly hinting towards near the end.For lack of a better term...it does exactly what it says on the tin, and that's deliver a tidal wave of stereotypical killings and setups but with the huge added bonus of seeing both Freddy and Jason slug it out. OK I admit it...its pretty much completely for the fanboys, but if you're a fanboy then get that handcream ready cos its geekgasm time!.7/10",Freddy vs. Jason
109,stamper,Wacko weekend part 3: Duel of the legends,6,24 October 2004,"Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger in one movie, well who would have thought that 15 years ago, but in 2003 it happened. Is there a way to combine 2 huge horror franchises like that? Of course, if the money is right!!! But can it be done in a way that does not seem utterly preposterous? Well apparently. I must say that I had my doubts when I saw the commercials for this one and I decided to just rent it someday. My main concerns were, that the story would be stupid and that Kelly Rowland (a.k.a. the chick that swings her besides Beyonce) would utterly suck as an actress. As it turned out both of these concerns were unfounded. The story is pretty good and I must admit that Rowland actually does OK. There were however some negative sides to this films. First of all the heroine (Monica Keena) couldn't act if her life depended on it (I'd rather seen her killed than the people that became the last 2 'living' dead of the film) and second of all the directing is pretty bad. I think someone ought to give Mr. Yu some pointers on directing. First of all he should refrain from using so much slow motion when it clearly adds nothing to the film, second of all he should learn when and how loud to put in a piece of music (especially when it is very hard rock music), third of all he should think about making a few scenes shorter (to pace the film up) and last BUT NOT least he should consider NOT using hard rock music in his films.Concluding I'd like to mention, that although I've been known to moan about cliché endings in horror films, I did not get annoyed by this one. The reason for that is that many other films regarded as horror flicks (like Wrong Turn, Urban Legend, Scream and I know what you did last summer) are indeed slashers meant to be taken seriously, whereas this one (and all other Freddy films) are more like a science fiction comedy. Therefore I do not take it seriously and therefore I can take the 'pun' ending.6,45 out of 10 (with a 6 given upon voting)",Freddy vs. Jason
110,ivo-cobra8,Evil vs Evil - awesome slasher movie about Freddy and Jason my all time favorite decent horror film!,10,24 October 2016,"Evil vs Evil two favorite slasher icons goes on each other Freddy vs Jason an epic battle fight. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. Two titans of terror enter into a horrifying and gruesome showdown -- Winner kills all! This is the last good film and underrated gem in the horror genre franchise and it is my favorite slasher film I love it to death! This the last good Freddy and Jason film in which both the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street franchises were both rebooted. This is the last Freddy movie in which Robert Englund performed the last time his character Freddy Krueger. I watched making off this film in 2003 and I saw an interview with Robert Englund reprising his role as Freddy for this film. I know Robert is old so his stuntman was doing the stunts for him. I rented VHS Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare in the video store that summer in 2003 because I am the biggest Freddy fan I always loved Freddy Krueger in all his movies except part 5 and the remake I still own Part 5 on DVD and Blu-ray collection. I am getting this movie on Blu-ray after new year that it is missing in my collection. I am a fan of Jason Voorhees the best movie that I really love to death is Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986) the best one in the franchise apart from Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, Friday the 13th Part III, Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood and the original movie of course I love them so much to death.Plot: The two biggest icons of the slasher genre finally meet in ""Freddy vs. Jason"" in a frightening showdown in hell! Banished there for eternity, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) devises a plan to manipulate Jason into continuing his work, hacking up the teenagers of Elm Street. All goes well at first until Jason realizes he's been duped by 'the dream master' and is none too pleased. Coaxed by surviving teenagers Will (Jason Ritter), Lori (Monica Keena), and Kia (Kelly Rowland), Jason and Freddy descend up Crystal Lake for a battle royale! I love this movie and cast did an excellent job. Chinese director Ronny Yu directed perfectly this short horror flick that I absolutely loved it. Robert Englund was excellent in his last role as horror icon Freddy. Ken Kirzinger as Jason Voorhees did a wonderful job. Ken even played Rusty Nail in Joy Ride 3, honestly he did a wonderful job and I like him. Monica Keena as Lori Campbell was great heroine in this movie and she was a great sole survivor. There was also Brendan Fletcher in this movie I remember him from Anatomy of a Hate Crime (2000), as Mark Davis a prisoner who escaped from jail and Jason Ritter as Will Rollins they both did great. Kelly Rowland as Kia Waterson was also good.This movie is not like any old crossover. The link between Freddy and Jason is really amazing and the whole concept of Freddy vs Jason is really cool. A great movie overall. This is no ordinary clash between to classic characters. At first it might seem that Freddy and Jason are working together but you are sorely mistaken, this quickly turns into a fight to the death. These enemies fight and travel all the way from Elm Street to Crystal Lake. If you like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th or any horror/thriller for that matter then this movie is definitely for you. It is possibly one of the best horrors I've seen.I am a huge fan of Friday the 13th for the reason it's more gory classic horror movie franchise than jump and A Nightmare on Elm Street. So this made for the one of the best movies ever with the perfect mix of gore and jumpiness. Have a spare pair on underwear when you watch:) Things I love about this movie: Freddy cuts Jason's fingers off, gouges his eyes out, and then proceeds to whack the hell out of him with his Own machete bad-ass scene! Even though, not ""completely"" a Freddy movie, this one still deserves to be in the A Nightmare Elm Street favorite horror movies franchise. I enjoyed it. And I don't care what anyone says, Freddy kicked the living **** out of Jason.I liked the practical special Effects and special FX makeup for Freddy and Jason they were pretty good and I love them.The rest of the cast and the director does a really great job.Overall: I am giving a 10/10 -- an outstanding score, this is the final Freddy movie in the franchise that I consider the last good Freddy movie. Here we got a killer from Camp Crystal Lake and a killer who haunts in your dreams. But they made Freddy loose his powers and he needed the kids to be afraid so he could be strong again while feeding on their fear, but how can he do that when he's not that effective in his nightmares? Of course! Jason! I love this movie to death!",Freddy vs. Jason
111,eminkl,I've seen much worse,4,18 April 2020,"At this point, who really cares about continuity, I guess. Jason's survived being blown to bits by a SWAT team, boiled in toxic waste, drug to hell by demons and disintegrated in the atmosphere. Freddy's been crushed, impaled, pipe bombed, stripped of his powers and forgotten. It isn't the first time we've set aside preceding stories for the sake of the next one, and in this case it's given a pass for the sake of a titular clash of legends. Only they don't actually clash until the final twenty minutes, and even then it's a bit underwhelming. Their heavyweight brawls deliver a few brief moments of awesome, but there's always something restraining these monsters, holding them back from really cutting loose, and the big climax is predictably open-ended. In keeping with both franchises, most of our story revolves around a tribe of empty-minded teens. Slowly, prophetically unraveling the plot, their numbers are whittled down until a pair of strong-willed survivors finally decide to fight back. The greater saga is a bit over-reaching, introducing and abandoning several pointless subplots, but it does a fair enough job of intertwining two distinct franchises and granting legitimate reasons for Freddy and Jason to cooperate and, later, throw down. It's trashy fun, loaded up with fan service and gruesome killings. Big and dumb and cringe-worthy, spiritually compatible with both legacies, and basically all it needed to be. I've seen much worse.",Freddy vs. Jason
112,gregsrants,All depends on what you are looking for.,6,10 January 2004,"Hollywood has never been known for its creativity.  Talk to some movie enthusiasts and they will say that there are only a handful of stories out there and Hollywood is able to manipulate them into hundreds of movies each year. Hollywood's latest re-invention is the teaming familiar people or groups together for purposes of defeating a common foe.  Blade II saw both the good and bad team towards the defeat of a bigger bad.  X-Men 2 did the same.  And movie posters and trailers at your local multiplex are parading Alien vs. Predator as one of 2004's big events.  So, it came as no surprise when Ronny Yu (Bride of Chucky), got the to ahead to direct two of the most notorious names in film history and pit them against each other in the apt titled Freddy vs. Jason.For anyone living on the planet Mars, Freddy is Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) who has terrorized the children of Elm Street for no less than six sequels.  Jason is Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzingerr), who every year on Friday the 13th, goes on a killing spree at Camp Crystal Lake.  Like Freddy, Jason has been at his trade for many a year and his sequels have gone as far as to represent the Roman numeral X after the title.  Together, these two behemoths have racked up more than a hundred dead bodies and provided millions of movie goers many thrills and chills since 1980.
Horror movies never have much of story, and Freddy vs. Jason is no different.  Here is all you need to know: Freddy has lost almost all his power as the children of Elm Street have all been put on dream suppressant drugs.  So, Freddy conjures from the grave one Mr. Voorhees to help scare the youngens and give him back his terrorizing powers.  But all is not well in the world of the mass murders.  Jason begins a killing rampage that takes from Freddy's murder wish list, and enraged, Freddy squares off with his counterpart in a battle for monster supremacy.Plot points are not abundant, but you never seem to mind, for there is everything that a horror film is suppose to deliver.  There are naked women, a shower scene, teenage sex, patronizing humor and, oh yeah, lots and lots of dead bodies.  In fact, a moment set at a cornfield rave probably offered the most blood and largest body count that Jason has had the pleasure in one scene.  But where Jason prances around town relentlessly killing with his trademark machete, Freddy is the artiste of the two and terrorizes his prey with inventive style such as burning messages into the back of victims and offering free nose jobs a la his razor knife glove.But, soon all the victims play second fiddle to the battle of the two stars, and battle they must.  Since both are seemingly immortal the two go toe to toe (or should I say machete to razors) in an endless battle of stabbing, slicing, tearing, impaling and there is even a few Tyson punches thrown in for effect.It's easy to criticize a movie such as Freddy vs. Jason.  There are no actors really of note (sorry Robert), and besides an incredible body count, there is not much substance either.  There is blood, and plenty of it.  In fact, I couldn't help but wonder what someone who works in a blood bank would think as they see gallons and gallons of blood being spewed at incredible regularity from all the severed limbs and twitching torsos.
So this film was made for those that will enjoy it the most, and that is the Fangoria reading horror mongers. If you don't like this genre, you will be incredibly turned off by the randomness of the killings and the complete disregard for human life.  For those that like blood and the thrill that these two beasts have given us over the years, you will be sitting in your seat salivating like a Pavlovian dog.  And for those of you like me that sit somewhere in-between, you will be happy you saw it, but glad that it ended. Or did it...",Freddy vs. Jason
113,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"More of an action movie than horror, but has some redeeming qualities",5,21 June 2006,"Freddy, after years of dormancy wants to get back to doing his favorite thing: slicing and dicing teenagers. Unfortunately for him, the new generation on Elm Street is not aware of him and that means he cannot kill them. For those of you new to Freddy, he can only kill people who are afraid of him as he feeds of off their fear in dreams. Not giving up so easily, Freddy goes wakes up Jason Voorhees so he can wreck mayhem on Elm Street and get people to believe that Freddy is back and then Freddy can get busy killing. This results in - get this - movie serial killer rivalry.That may sound pretty funny and I must say that that is the highlight of this highly gory action film dressed as horror. The scares are all cliché and the film isn't really scary, especially for fans that have seen films from both franchises. The films strength, if there is one, is the action and darkly toned humor. And there is a lot of it. Jason and Freddy manage to rack up a lot of inventive carnage in the form of mainly teenagers before clashing themselves.Avid fans of Freddy and Jason were probably on the lookout for a possible clash between the two monsters since a previous film in one of the franchises heavily hinted at it. The result is similar to Aliens vs. Predator (or any other 'vs' movie that you can think of) in that you have to like like at least one of the franchises to enjoy this film, but seeing that each franchise has a multitude of sequels that shouldn't really be a problem. Also is pays to know a little of the back story (from previous films) about Freddy and Jason to know what the heck is really going on here.So, fans of Freddy and Jason be ready for some fun but other should steer clear. 5/10Rated R for outrageously gory violence, drugs, and profanity.",Freddy vs. Jason
114,mario_c,Jason! Jason! Jason! I support Jason,7,16 October 2007,"This film is pure old 80's fun! It's good to see again these two ""old friends"" from the 80's horror movies I used to watch when I was a young teenager! As many other people of my age (28 years old) I was introduced to horror movies watching ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday, the 13th"" series. And, at that time, they were the best I could get! It was great renting those movies in VHS to watch them with my friends! Good old times! And now they are back, to fight with each other I support Jason! I think they are both ""cool"", but Jason is a ""myth""! Jason is the ""Living Legend"" of the horror scene! He's definitely a ""master slasher""... But Freddy got his trumps too! That little song is unforgettable, and the way he's always changing his body forms is really nice too! They're both great, but I support Jason anyway. Though, the most important thing that we all shall know is: Freddy and Jason NEVER DIE!",Freddy vs. Jason
115,deatman9,mindless entertainment...THATS IT!!,6,19 October 2012,I am only giving this movie a six for the sole reason I went into it knowing it was going to be bad. I went in with the mindset just laugh and have a goodtime and thats exactly what happened. With lots of boobs and fun kills this definitely holds your attention if you look past that though it cant hold up.This movie is about serial killer Freddy Kruger who needs people to believe in him so he gets power to enter their dreams and kill them. So he rises Jason Vorhees from the dead so the people think its freddy killing people. But when Jason starts taking all the credit Freddy gets angry and the fight between them is on.As you can tell by my description the movie is pretty silly thats why Im saying you have to go into this movie just looking to enjoy the ride. If you want Oscar performances you wont get it because the actors are all terrible,Freddy vs. Jason
116,Superunknovvn,A dream come true! (EXCLAMATION MARK),8,28 November 2003,"I think I had never felt like this before when I walked into the cinema. It was an absolute dream come true for me. I had prepared over a year for this film, this once in a lifetime-event. I had chased every picture, every piece of scoop I could find about this movie on the internet. It was very painful when ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" was finally released in June in the U.S. and I still had to wait until November until the film saw its theatrical release in Vienna where I live. Yesterday, the big day had come. Is there a way that a movie that's been so hyped by myself can still live up to my expectations? Abso-friggin-lutely!WOW! ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is unbelievable. What sounds like a loony's idea (to be honest, die hard-Freddy & Jason-fans like myself are mostly loonies) was made into a kick-ass flick for a wide audience. Bring along your kids, bring along your grandparents and enjoy the roller coaster ride that is ""Freddy vs. Jason"".When I heard that Ronny Yu was going to be the director for this project I checked out two of his previous movies (""51st State"" & ""Bride of Chucky"") and wasn't exactly blown away. These movies were okay but nowhere near as good as I wanted ""Freddy vs. Jason"" to be. Well, I have to apologize to Mr. Yu. Not only did he revive both franchises like no one would have expected it to be possible, he also managed to COMBINE the two and not make it absolutely ridiculous.Of course, the horror that made the original ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" so scary and the first ""Friday The 13th"" so, hmm... dark is gone by now, but it has been gone for more than ten years. Get over it, people! A movie called ""Freddy vs. Jason"" HAS TO BE campy. No wonder the dialog is incredibly bad at times (""Freddy is afraid of fire, Jason is afraid of water... how can we use that?""), no wonder the actors are no Academy Award winners. The right things are deliberately hammed up and self-ironic (like a boobie-goddess playing the main character, who is supposed to be a 14 year old virgin. Come on, nobody is really supposed to take that seriously!)Let's get to the main attraction, Freddy & Jason. I have to admit I was rooting for Freddy. I adored this character since he first scared the crap out of me as a child. I had trouble falling asleep for days and although I don't find Freddy scary anymore I still love his story, his attitude and his one-liners. ""Freddy vs. Jason"" did him justice and that's also and mostly due to the great Robert Englund. I was down on the floor laughing my ass off as this man put up yet another great show with merciless jokes and dark comedy. Let's hope he never retires. As for Jason, he's better than ever. Sure, it would have been nice to have long time-Jason-actor Kane Hodder in this movie, but Ken Kirzinger did a very good job. Ronny Yu wasn't afraid of showing gore and Jason got some pretty original kills. (Just why is he afraid of water all of a sudden?)Another plus for Ronny Yu is the use of colors. Preview pics of ""Freddy vs. Jason"" showed that this movie was going to be very colorful, which made me skeptic at first. Nightmare 4 & 5 had been red, green and blue all over and it looked very cheap and comic like. Not so with ""Freddy vs. Jason"". The colors look atmospheric here. The rain looked a little fake but that's probably just me.The story is simple, which is good compared to the far fetched rejected drafts that are spread across the Internet. Maybe there were a little too many subplots in the final version, which made the movie slow in the middle. I could have done without the character that was like a copy of Kevin Smith's Jay, too. Apart from these little flaws there's no need to be nitpicky.The box office success of ""Freddy vs. Jason"" was just as exciting as the film itself. It helped bring back classic 80's horror. Studios considered and made sequels/remakes to movies such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacres"" & ""Halloween"" again. The commercial success of ""Freddy vs. Jason"" also proved that there's still enough life in both of these characters to justify more sequels. Freddy was killed off way too soon anyway. Only 6 sequels? Come on, I want to see more of him, but make the movies original for Christ's sake! I'd rather see Freddy die than going to straight-to-video-hell. That's why I hope a ""Nightmare""-prequel will never be made and why I beg producers not to make a ""Freddy vs. Jason 2"" or any other obscure vs.-movies. ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is the fulfillment of every fans dream and that is that.Phew... have I said everything? Have I expressed my euphoria enough? Let me just say this at the end: A lot of people had eagerly waited for this project to be realized. Thanks Ronny Yu, Robert Englund and New Line for making it come true!",Freddy vs. Jason
117,Movie-Misfit,A Lot Of Fun!!,8,5 November 2019,"I'm a huge fan of Ronny Yu's Hong Kong films so when I heard he was going to be directing this, I was pretty excited!!And he does not disappoint!Bringing two of our most loved modern-horror icons for a battle to the death was just brilliant. And while we may get treated to the usual scream-teen-on-screen nonsense that helped make the 80s slasher flicks what they are, it is the sight and actions of having these two monsters sharing the scene that really makes this amazing.Yes the storyline might be so outrageous, it shouldn't work - but it does because of the tongue-in-cheek direction in how Yu handled it. Freddy looks the meanest he has ever looked, and while more humorous than his last role in Wes Craven's New Nightmare - he's not as cartoonish as he was in Freddy's Dead. This adds some genuine laughs, especially when they are fighting each other!And fight they do! With some Hong Kong styled action thrown into the mix (not to mention cinematography), I was reminded of Yu's own Bride With White Hair and others such as Saviour of the Soul, Heroic Trio, etc.Freddy vs Jason is not perfect, but its damn good fun and definitely one of my favourites!I just wish we could have seen its sequel - or one of the many rumoured to follow... Well, here's hoping!!",Freddy vs. Jason
118,TheOtherFool,Some good pulp,5,14 September 2004,"So far, I've seen six of the Elm Street movies and just one (the original) of Friday the 13th. Adding Freddy vs Jason, this one sure isn't the worst of the bunch (as one would expect).Freddy needs Jason to bring back fear in the Elm Street area, so that the kids will dream about him again. His scheme works, but then he has to deal with Jason once more...A nice catch, and although the movie needs a little time to really pick up then offers a lot of fun. The makers meanwhile made sure on what demographic to aim; lots of blood and cleavage, it's what the kids like these days!As Freddy vs. Jason is part of the more enjoyable pulp, as it gives you a good night of laughs.5/10.",Freddy vs. Jason
119,acidburn-10,Dream Come true,8,23 February 2013,"I remember when they first announced that this movie was gonna get made and then it didn't happen for many years and then all of sudden it got released in 2003 and I was thrilled and couldn't wait to see this as being a massive fan of both Freddy and Jason. With all the anticipation ""Freddy Vs Jason"" has a lot to live up to and I can gladly say that this movie was a dream come true, I don't what other reviewers say, I found that this movie lived up to expectations in almost every single way and definitely lived up to all the hype.I mean come on its Freddy and Jason, I was instantly hooked from the opening credits right through to the epic battle at the end. Okay this movie isn't perfect but its pure fun through and through, it has plenty of bloodshed and mayhem that kept me satisfied and of course Robert England is on red hot fire as Freddy as always. But the acting from the main cast wasn't all that great, Monica Keena and Jason Ritter were okay I guess but they just lacked chemistry for me, but they were kind of likable and how did Kelly Rowland get a part in this, she just looked out of place as a teenager and can't act to save her life (well it doesn't) but she has a cool death scene though one of the many highlights of this movie. But Ken Kirzinger does a bang up job as Jason and does display menace.This movie is definitely better than the previous later sequels churned out by both franchises as they were starting to get a bit stale and this movie definitely breathed new life into each franchise giving them both the boost that they needed. I liked how we get to see inside Jason's head for a change and show him as a child which was rather interesting and we also get to see a bit more of Freddy before he got torched and the death scenes are definitely top notch like when Jason interrupts a corn field rave and starts hacking people up is pure class and the final fight between the two icons is a definite must see as we get plenty of blood eye gouging, heads rolling and even a little bit of comedy from Freddy which didn't seem out of place.All in all ""Freddy Vs Jason"" definitely didn't disappoint but does have some small flaws but nothing that spoils this amount of fun and especially if you're a fan of both these maniacs.",Freddy vs. Jason
120,jp_91,Two horror icons in one film!,10,15 January 2020,"Ronny Yu brought back the horror crossovers with two 80's horror icons: Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. ""Freddy vs. Jason"" was a nostalgic film in 2003, back then the slasher films were not like in the 80's, that magic was over but this film brought a bit of that touch. The script is funny with a creepy cinematohraphy, good performances, of course a great Robert Englund. Known as ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 8"" and ""Friday the 13th Part 11"", ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is the goriest film of these franchises. Not a masterpiece but a good film!",Freddy vs. Jason

The movie is called Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy from A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13th. I did enjoy this movie as i thought it turned out to be a blast horror movie for the year 2003. I did like the idea of what the creators came up with, creating a film with 2 serial killers from different horror movies, Besides making freddy vs jason as a movie with 2 characters, there is yet another freddy vs jason movie to be made, freddy vs jason 2 is to be confirmed and to be made. I give this movie 10 out of 10 because i thought it was a fantastic movie and i thought it turned out to be a very good one after all the other horror movies based on the characters over the years.",Freddy vs. Jason
122,TalesfromTheCryptfan,A treat for fans of both franchises including me!,10,31 October 2010,"10 years after the events of ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare"" and 3 years after ""Jason Goes to Hell The Final Friday"", it seems Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) has been stuck in hell for the longest time and everyone in Springwood has rejoiced over the years with re-population. He wants to be free from hell as he decides to use Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) as a puppet as he lures him out of hell to be reborn again so he can head away from Camp Crystal Lake to Springwood to terrorize the teenagers on Elm Street. A group of teenagers like Lori (Monica Keena), Kia (Kelly Rowland), Will (Jason Ritter) and more are being terrorized by Jason Voorhees as he cuts some teens into bloody sushi for Freddy as however Jason can't stop killing making Freddy very angry leaving a battle of evil vs. evil in the dreamworld and Crystal lake in the real world.An excellent crossover movie and wonderful sequel to both franchises! it took 18 years in the making in development hell. Originally this concept of having the two together started in 1986 when Paramount wanted to join with New Line Cinema to do a Jason meets Freddy movie but both companies couldn't agree to do the film, by 1989 Paramount decided that the Friday The 13th movies were no more as they disowned Jason Voorhees but until 1991 when New Line cinema decided to kill off Freddy Krueger they bought the rights for the character Jason from Paramount. New Line Cinema made their first Jason adventure called ""Jason Goes to Hell"" as at the end of the movie Freddy's glove appeared making it a teaser to this movie thus it took 11 years in development hell since then with different directors and ideas. ""Jason X"" was made but made fans upset since it bombed in theaters as New Line decided to greenlight the idea with Ronny Yu who did the excellent ""Bride of Chucky"" as director.I say it's one of the most satisfying movies of either franchises as it's a fanboy's dream come true after all these years. Monica Keena is sizzling hot in this movie as usual including Kathrina Isabella to give eye-candy to us guys as there is plenty of action, gore, comedy, mayhem and hot nude girls. This movie delivers the goods to fans of both franchises like myself including me as it is Englund's last role for Freddy.",Freddy vs. Jason
123,LoneWolfAndCub,Great Merging Of Two Horror Icons,6,5 July 2005,"Many critics didn't like it. Many viewers thought it was pure crap.DON'T LISTEN.Freddy Vs Jason, directed by Ronny Yu is actually a good film. This film is just a no-brainer horror flick. It has boobs, drugs and a whole lot of blood.The plot is fairly simple. Freddy can't kill anymore so he resurrects Jason to kill for him and give him his power back. Things go wrong when Jason won't stop killing, so Freddy takes things into his own hands. Leading up to a great final battle.The acting is mediocre but it's a slasher with a teen cast hired for their looks over acting abilities, what would you expect?There is no CGI in this movie which makes it even better to watch. The gore isn't cut back and as always Jason and Freddy are great.Don't be deterred from this movie, it may be crap, but it's great crap. 3/5.",Freddy vs. Jason
124,OriginalMovieBuff21,What a waste,3,17 October 2004,"Freddy vs. Jason is by golly one of the worst films of 2003. It's not in the bottom 3 but it is maybe in the bottom 5. Don't directors see their films and just look back on it and say, ""Will audiences enjoy these two characters after the classics."" Gosh, can't they tell that the movie sucks. It's all stupid action with bad acting and pointless film-making. It's just a waste of time. I mean you want to make money right, well you might make a lot of money for this film but after all your stupid directing and stuff, you won't make another because they know your films are stupid. Just forget about this film and don't ever see a movie that has versus in it with your favorite characters in it because the director will ruin it.Hedeen's outlook: 3/10 No Stars F",Freddy vs. Jason
125,EmperorNortonII,Freddy + Jason = Overkill,7,1 September 2003,"""Freddy Vs. Jason"" seems to be the movie that millions of slasher film devotees have been praying for.  It's the sort of pop culture summit that follows the spirit of ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" or ""King Kong Vs. Godzilla.""  However, only a slasher film devotee can truly appreciate it. Anyone else probably won't be able to enjoy it.  Bring together two legendary bloodthirsty characters, and you're bound to see a lot of blood and gore, which is just what happens here.  And the idea that Camp Crystal Lake is so close to the town of Springwood does seem like a stretch.  The film has a few moments, however.  Like when it delves into Jason's past to learn his fears.  And I thought Freddy as the Caterpillar from ""Alice In Wonderland"" was an interesting vision.  But on the whole, I can't recommend ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" to anyone who's not into slasher movies.",Freddy vs. Jason
126,asda-man,Never marry an icon (just watch them hack each other to pieces!),7,29 March 2011,"This film is definitely one for the fans of the 80's horror. It may seem obvious, but if you don't like ""A Nightmare On Elm St."" or ""Friday The 13th"" or the characters Freddy and Jason, you will hate this! However, if you do really like the films (like me!) and you do really like the characters (like me again!) Then this really will be an absolute dream come true. I can't think of anything better than watching two horror icons battling it out together. When Freddy takes Jason's machete and Jason rips off Freddy's famous knife hand, I did really rub eyes to see if this monumental moment was actually happening before me.Some fans could be quite p****d off though, if you are after a truly great 80's horror film, because this plays on the old clichés which is great in my opinion, because it means it's playing homage and makes it fun to watch. This film isn't to be taken seriously, ""ooh it's daft"" is what some people have said to me, well yeah, it's meant to be unbelievable that's why it's so fun to watch. You don't watch ""Brain Dead"" and think ""oof this is silly!"" (well you might, but if you do you need to get a life!) you just watch the carnage and have a ball! Same prinicipals go for this.Let's dig into the story a bit. It does seem like a sorry excuse to have two horror icons starring in the same film, but who cares! The idea is their so it could be worse, it could be just completely randomn, but it's not. It's thought out and satisfying. The gore is also brilliant! If you're into all the decapitations and blood then this is right up your street! It's great and just plain fun! (I've said fun too much now) Anyways, this is great fun (stop it!) and if you are a horror fan and willing to go with it, you're in for a treat, rather than a trick!",Freddy vs. Jason
127,departed07,A long delayed project that is a waste of time,1,26 July 2005,"Another crappy horror film has come and about in our life; in 2002 we had Halloween: Resurrection, the sequel to the movie franchise of Michael Myers in which the film was original suppose to come out in 2001, but was delayed because the director wanted a real setting. What is different about this horror flick is that the director and New Line Cinema wanted to get the infamous villains, the retarded Jason Voorhees and the razor-clawed burned freak, Freddy Krugger after fans of ""Friday the 13th"" saw the claw of Fred Kruger grabbing the hockey mask.The storyline: Whoever wins, we die! That's right, not only must these two villains fight each other, but kill anybody that gets in their way.Freddy Vs. Jason is a bloodbath film in which we don't care about what goes on except mutilated body parts hanging from left to right. I was never a fan of ""Friday the 13th"" because it was too gruesome and that Jason needs to be blown in the head with a rocket launcher, while ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" had a purposed because we had a bogeyman invading our nightmares in the most gruesome way.If I had to choose a winner in this fight, maybe Michael Myers might interfere since he has some better sequels than the ones Freddy or Jason made.",Freddy vs. Jason
128,Spanner-2,For the fans,8,25 August 2003,"The battle fans have been clamoring for years to take place finaly occurs in a cinema near you. Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund, who can by now play this role in his sleep) uses Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger, replacing Kane Hodder for no apparent reason) to scare the kids of Elm Street into remembering him, and then he gets jealous and they have a couple of knock down fights. The fights are impressive, Englund is in fine camp form and they throw in some nice touches for the fans. Problems do exist in the casting of the human characters, who are so anoying and poorly written that they become just cannon fodder.. the best chapters in these two series all had interesting people to kill.. Stll, fans will probably enjoy it. GRADE: B",Freddy vs. Jason
129,t_atzmueller,"Fans of the original films will be disappointed, but, hey, you'll get Freddy vs Jason",5,15 February 2012,"I admit it: I'm a sucker for 80's and 90's fantasy-, science fiction- and horror-franchises. I have been a fan since the very first hour, ceremoniously watching every sequel to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"", despite each sequel becoming more of a farce. I watched ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" turn into a kid-compatible show and ""Friday the 13th"" eating away on its own legacy, each following episode being lamer imitations of the original.Still, fans are devout and one would continue to buy the ticket, buy the VHS, not to mention the merchandise. And of course the fans rooted for that inevitable event, when both super-serial-killers would meet in a crossover-movie. Expectation was fervent but not all too high and so, the disappointment in the end-result was milder than had we expected a great movie.The film has many faults, where to start? Let's go with the director: Ronny Yu may well be an accomplished martial arts director, but what qualifies him for ""Freddy vs Jason"", fails me. Had this been directed by Wes Craven, Sam Raimi or even a young hopeful like Rob Zombie but there couldn't have been a worst choice then Ronny Yu. Talking of martial arts, director Yu sees it fit to have the cult-monsters slug it out  with KUNG FU! Despite the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Halloween""-franchises being on a similar decline, we have yet to witness a kickboxing Michael Myers.Another problem that plagues the early fans is that this film was clearly made for a 21st century audience, rooting for a decisively younger audience. This also implies the use of CGI instead of traditional special-effects and CGI-blood is thinner than water. There is a ""who cares""-effect, whenever one of the faceless teen-characters is killed off with the aid of computer animation.As for the actors: most of the cast should be unknowns to Freddy- / Jason-fans and rather B-movie-like - let's just say, you won't find a future Kevin Bacon or Johnny Depp among the cast. Robert Englund goes through the Freddy-routine, along the lines of the ""Freddy's Nightmares""-ham-acting. Ken Kirzinger plays Jason as a lumbering hulk, which, although technically is what Jason is, but has none of the charm of Ken Hodders rendition.Too modern for fans of the originals, too camp and comic-like for fans of 'real' horror films, there's really no reason to watch this film apart from seeing Jason Voorhees slug it out with Freddy Krueger. And that's all you'll get.5 out of 10 points.That said, ""Freddy vs Jason"" is still better than the recent remakes.",Freddy vs. Jason

131,FilmFanInTheHouse,Two Horror Icons Clash In An Epic Battle!,7,22 December 2007,"Freddy vs. Jason (2003, Dir. Ronny Yu)It's been nearly ten years since Freddy Krueger terrorised people in the dreams, and the towns folk want to keep him erased from their memory. Freddy still has one more plan on getting back to Elm Street. He resurrects Jason Vorhees and sends him off to kill. The more bodies which fall to the ground, the stronger in which Freddy becomes. This is until, Freddy realises that Jason isn't going to step aside easily, and must be taken down himself.I am a fan of two of the biggest horror franchises. Just like many of viewers around the world. Having Freddy Krueger from the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series and Jason Vorhees from the 'Friday the 13th' series battle each other to the death would be like a dream come true on film. Question is: Can they fight enough to entertain us? The story is quite basic and easy to understand. They go back to the start of the film franchises and make it very dark, with the qualities of both killers seen in their first films appearing. Robert Englund is back as Freddy Krueger and proves once again, that no one can play Freddy other than him. The rest of the cast aren't the most well known stars, but do their job effectively. Kelly Rowland is surprisingly good. The characters range from interesting (Chris Marquette's lovable nerd role) to the quite dull characters (Jason Ritter's tag along boyfriend). The fight is incredible and bloody, that it really does feel like a battle of the Gods. Some critics don't seem to enjoy it that great, but you watch it and make a decision. My personal opinion, is that it's definitely a lot better than most of the Freddy and Jason sequels.""Oh, $hit."" - Linderman (Chris Marquette) ""LINDERMAN!"" - Shack (Chris Gauthier) ""Err guys. I don't drink."" - Linderman (Chris Marquette)",Freddy vs. Jason
132,baileycrawly,Not as Bad as I Remember,6,26 October 2019,"For years, the world had been waiting for Freddy to go up against someone in the slasher world. Who it would be was a mystery, with literally dozens of scripts floating around the internet of varying stages of completion and legitimacy, but the fans knew that something was up for a long time.
Finally, we got to see Freddy vs. Jason. Directed by Ronny Yu of Bride of Chucky fame (a film I personally love), everybody was expecting this to be a fantastic showdown of villains.
What we got definitely could've been a lot better. But, it also could've been a lot worse. Being that this would be the last time (thus far) that Robert Englund would don the Freddy character for a feature film, I think they should've made it a little better. Nevertheless, we got what we got.
The storyline they created to weave these two franchises together was one I thought was quite interesting. I had never been enchanted by the Friday the 13th series, so I was watching almost exclusively for Freddy's portion, and I found myself rooting for both villains by the end. It was a fun slasher movie and it brought two icons together, but beyond that I don't think it offered very much. In the grand scheme of things, it's really irrelevant.

Jason, the silent killer who wears a hockey mask and will never die.Who would you say has the upper hand? Is it Freddy because he's the one with the brains? Or is it Jason because he's the one with the muscles and endurance? I think Jason is better than Freddy because I like the 'Friday the 13th' films better than the 'Nightmare On Elm Street' movies.That's not to say that I don't like Freddy Krueger.He's actually one of the cinema's most clever and funny serial killers.But since Jason can withstand almost any kind of damage, I think that he really has the advantage against Freddy.He's only weak when he's fighting Freddy in his dreams.In this latest installment in the Friday and Nightmare films, Freddy Krueger plans to awaken Jason from his grave to kill people on Elm Street in order to install enough fear to make Freddy more powerful.How genius of him.I thought this was a very well made horror movie that delivered plenty of violence and some laughter.What the movie really lacked was horror.Despite it not being scary, 'Freddy Vs. Jason' unleashes the 2 most powerful Cinema serial killers in 1 movie that never lets up for a minute and delivers lots of blood and violence.Winner kills all.My overall score is an 8.5.""Welcome to my world, Bi*ch""",Freddy vs. Jason

Although the concept of them going head-to-head was fairly decent. The characters were well played and all of that. But only one problem...NOT ENOUGH FREDDY FIGHTING JASON! I mean, don't get me wrong, this was a decent movie, but like Friday the 13th Part VII (Jason Goes to Manhattan), the title got me hyped up and I was quite disappointed. The characters seemed to steal the movie at times. Jason was NOT played by Kane Hodder! Whats up with that? He walked too much like a robot in this. He was played by Ken Kirzinger (Who played the big chef in F13 Part 8 who confronts Jason in the diner). He just didn't play Jason that well. The producers picked him to play Jason because they wanted Jason to look big when next to Freddy, and Kane Hodder wasn't all that huge. But still... 6/10",Freddy vs. Jason
135,supertom-3,Top grade Gore-fest!!,6,18 August 2003,"This is an extremely enjoyable romp starring horrors two biggest icons, Freddy Kruger and Jason Vorhees. While the film may have every single horror cliche imaginable, and is about as scary as the Tweenies, the film has a real sense of fun about it and takes delight in poking fun at the horror genre.Horror fans will adore this film, particularly fans of the two central characters. Ronny Yu's take on these legends is a visually arresting, in your face, no holds barred, gore fest. This film has everything in gratuity. The violence, the bad taste, the female nudity, I love it! Of course at the same time the film is about as brainless and moronic as they come and the story about how these two come together is laughable but who cares? Just sit bag and watch the carnage as dozens of teenagers die in blood soaked and imaginative ways.  The film looks great, possibly the best looking of all and the high production values also help, not to mention a good score from Graeme Revell.A key aspect of this films success is the humour, the film is funny, particularly Robert Englund as Freddy who has a ball. Of course Jason is about as funny as thrush but the way many characters play off him brings humour and there is a usual array of comical stoners, and geeks who all end up dying horribly. Also in the cast is Destiny Child's Kelly Rowland (my personal favourite from the band) she makes a pretty good debut.All in all this is a fun film, the battles between Freddy and Jason are superb and you cannot help but admire the childishness of the film and the gallons of gore. ***",Freddy vs. Jason
136,skybrick736,Freddy vs Jason (7/10),7,10 May 2015,"Every horror fan was waiting for a clash between two giant slasher icons to battle it out, finally in 2003, Freddy vs. Jason hit theaters. What impressed me most about the highly sought after Freddy vs. Jason crossover was the coherent story the writers managed to string together. Freddy's story was obviously a lot stronger, bringing Jason back to life to murder kids, in order for Springwood to remember him. Jason basically had a little feeble side story but it gave room for him to get most of the kills. The story managed to succeed but the acting, not so much. There was some really awful lines throughout the film which were pretty cringy. Monica Keena and Jason Ritter as the main protagonist didn't really shine either, shockingly the supporting cast was much better. Robert Englund might have had one of his better performances in this too, having some great one liners and kick ass kung-fu scenes. I thought Ronny Yu put out a decent film and didn't disappoint with the action and kills in this highly anticipated horror installment of A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th.",Freddy vs. Jason
137,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,19 April 2005,"After years of legal disputes and fans' wailing, two of the horror genres most loved bad guys finally got the chance to meet and fight. Managing to mix the trademarks of both the Elm street and Friday 13th franchises, Freddy vs Jason knows exactly what it is, and delivers- gory, violent fun with the right balance between scares and jokes. Ronny Yu gives the fans what they want to see, buckets of teenage blood from elaborate deaths, and of course Krueger and Voorhees facing off.The hideous past of Elm street has been forgotten, pasted over by the current council and the old folks in charge. Along the kids who died have been put in the past as if they never existed, as well as the creature who killed them- Freddy. Scientists created some new drug which stops kids from dreaming, therefore preventing Krueger from ever coming back-if no-one knows about him he cannot hurt anyone. Those kids who remember though are locked up in a local asylum so that they cannot infect the rest of their town. Freddy though still exists, waiting in Hell for his chance. He finally comes up with a cunning plan involving another notorious teen killer, Jason who has issues with his mother. Freddy, in the guise of Mrs Voorhees wakens Jason and tells him he needs to escape from Hell because their are a new bunch of naughty kids at Crystal Lake who need to be taught a lesson they'll never forget, or remember. Freddy thinks that once Jason is let loose on Elm Street and starts killing, the teens will get scared giving Freddy power, and that they will eventually find out who Freddy was, giving him the power to return as they will think he is causing the deaths. This goes according to plan at first with Jason killing anyone in sight, but Freddy begins to get annoyed that Jason is having all the fun and doesn't appreciate being sidelined. So he plans to take down Jason himself leading to a final confrontation. Meanwhile, the kids of Elm street are trying to destroy both maniacs, trying to find their weaknesses and exploit the fact that they are fighting each other.To mix two films was always going to be a difficult process, so the writers must be greatly commended for coming up with a good idea and good script. Admittedly once the premise is established all that is left is the usual-kids try to find out who is killing them, and find a way to stop them. There are plenty of homages to past entries in both series, and more importantly there is a lot of blood and plenty of inventive deaths. The films moves at a great pace, doesn't, to its credit, try to be clever by over-complicating matters. Englund is very good again, and Kirzinger is OK as Jason, and the rest of the cast of teens are fine, as most of them are there to be killed. Keena is likable as the heroine, but is nothing like the strong figure of Nancy. Ritter as the hero locked away because of his past with Freddy is also good, and the obligatory love story between them does not slow down the plot or killings. The more interesting relationship is between Kia and Linderman, the feisty friend of the heroine, and the nerd who falls for her. Its always good to see a Destiny's Child reject get slaughtered on film, though to her credit she is good in the role. For violent, silly horror movies, this is definitely one of the best recent efforts as it does not take itself seriously and features some good death scenes and plenty of gore and excitement.8 out of 10.",Freddy vs. Jason
138,Finfrosk86,I'd call this a classic. Close to perfection.,9,11 July 2017,"The low rating on this movie is just utter idiocy. It simply shows that WAY to many people only care about having an extreme opinion. Well, isn't my opinion kind of extreme too, you may ask? Well, I super rarely rate movies this high, actually, but this one is just that good.I'm not going to get all into the long, long time it took for this movie to be made, but let's just say: thank goodness it was.This is pretty much as close to perfect as this movie could have been. It doesn't take itself that seriously, but still serious enough. It's got a great Jason (one of the best, I think) the real deal Freddy, likable characters, lot's of good gore, a pretty good story, good effects. Overall it is really, really well made. Sure, there are some stuff that could be better, but that is always the case. Take a moment and think of all the stuff they could have messed up. Just think about it.It's a real shame that Ronny Yu has directed so few movies after this one. Because he really did an excellent job. Think of the expectations? How many years in the making? How many scripts? Taking on this project at all, deserves big respect.I am a huge horror fan, I love Friday, Freddy, Halloween, all of em, pretty much. Just wanted that said. I'm not clueless when it comes to horror.For me this is very close to a perfect horror/slasher movie. It has the awesome dream-stuff from Elm, and the awesome Jason and slashing from Friday. This should have like a 7-rating on here, at least. But well, for a lot of people having an extreme opinion, mostly negative, is the most important thing. And that is a damn shame.Freddy vs Jason is such a fantastic popcorn horror teen slasher movie, and I love it.",Freddy vs. Jason
139,theshadow908,Surprisingly entertaining!,7,15 May 2006,"Freddy Vs. Jason is more of a sequel to the Nightmare on Elm St. series with Jason as a guest star. All the children on Elm St. have forgotten Freddy, so they don't dream about him. Freddy resurrects Jason and sends him to Elm St. to kill a few kids so Freddy gets credit. Unfortunately, Jason can't stop, so Freddy sets out to stop him. This movie is creative and entertaining, and totally picks up the slump of the two declining series.The writing and the plot of the film are pretty good. A lot of references to the older Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St. films are made which makes it even better. The fight scenes are well played out and they gave both of the killers a chance to show off their talents. I loved the addition of pre-dead Jason and Freddy scenes. They really added to the picture. Also, this is one of the goriest slasher movies you'll ever see. Blood just sprays everywhere through the whole movie.This movie has better slasher film acting than most, aside from Monica Keena who really hams it up. Robert Englund is back as Freddy and as good as ever. He even cracks off a few of his famous Freddy jokes. Ken Kirzinger has taken over for the great Kane Hodder in the role of Jason Voorhees and he does a really good job. Jason Ritter does the best acting job in the movie, but you can't expect any less from the son of John Ritter.Obviously there are flaws. Some of the fight scenes are a bit over the top. I didn't know that Freddy Krueger was a master at kung fu! Anyways, you're obviously not getting the perfect film here, but it's better than any Friday the 13th film, and better than most Nightmare on Elm St. films.7/10",Freddy vs. Jason
140,bh_tafe3,A Faithful Merging of Two Classics,7,5 February 2009,"Upon seeing this for the first time, every Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street let out a huge sigh of relief. This was a good movie. Everything we hoped it could be.The effects are good. The story makes sense and is well paced. The acting is fine. The ending is fine. They did everything well.Freddy Krueger has been erased from history. His name has been blacked out from news and police reports, his crimes forgotten, any knowledge of him hidden away from the minds of young children and teenagers, rendering him powerless and ineffective. So he gets a plan, set Jason Vorhees loose on Elm Street, the people will assume it's Freddy back again and start talking about him again and he can get back his powers.But Jason proves too effective, getting too much of the credit and so Freddy, who's powers are returning slower than he would like decides to target Jason. The teenagers caught in the middle side with Jason as the lesser of two evils and the two big evils have a huge confrontation at Camp Crystal Lake, with Jason winning the battle for slasher supremacy.The Jason kills in this are proper Friday the 13th style kills, the Freddy kills in this are proper Nightmare on Elm Street kills. The two anti heroes are exactly who they are in their own series. The continuity is perfect.A film that could have been a disaster turns out to be a well made, entertaining and faithful merging of two horror classics. Well done to all involved.Contains sex scenes and nudity for those who are wondering.",Freddy vs. Jason
141,Li_85,"Fast, funny and fantastic",10,12 June 2006,"Freddy Vs Jason is a roller coaster ride of Thrills. Plenty of Great Violence as the death toll rise. Firstly, it was a wonderful idea to bring Two of Horrors Greatest Icons in one movie. Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street series. Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th series. I have seen all Freddy and Jason movies already, so i was very excited to see this. They are both the right choice for a horror battle. I don't think Micheal Myers, Pinhead, Candyman or any other boogeyman would of looked good as Freddy and Jason. It has many Enjoyable scenes and entertains through out. This movie didn't do great business, but if you are a horror fan, you must love this movie. Jason looks far better then Freddy.",Freddy vs. Jason
142,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Entertaining And Memorable Horror Film With The Two Horror Icons.",10,5 May 2015,"Freddy VS Jason is an excellent,entertaining and memorable Horror film that combines great direction,wonderful performances by Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger,a fine score and good special effects. All of those elements Freddy vs Jason a fantastic genre film that Freddy and Jason at their best.Freddy vs Jason tells the story about Freddy Kruger(Robert Englund),the sadistic killer and nightmare invader who has been sitting in the depths of Hell and has no power because teenagers have forgotten about him. Wanting to get his powers back and for Teens to remember him he hires Jason Voorhees(Ken Kirzinger)to do the killing for him but when Jason starts claiming victims that Freddy wants for himself,Freddy decides to get rid of Jason which leads to a bloody battle between the two which will leave one man standing.Released in 2003,Freddy Vs Jason is a terrific and entertaining Horror film that after a combined 17 movies in the 1980s and 90s and almost 20 different unproduced screenplays finally crossed over the two Horror icons in A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Kruger and Friday The 13th's Jason Voorhees in a once in a lifetime meeting and showdown between these two legends of Horror cinema that was a big Box Office success for Freddy and Jason and lives up to fan expectations. While the movie isn't a Horror Classic or Masterpiece in any way shape or form and is far from perfect Freddy Vs Jason is a movie that is a complete thrill ride from beginning to end and is a film that was made for fans of both Freddy and Jason. The plot isn't important,the story won't be thought-provoking or serious this is all about seeing Freddy and Jason fighting it out to the death and to see who wins and who losses. All of the known elements of both the Elm Street and Friday The 13th movies are in here such as blood,gore and a high body count of dead teenagers. When you watch this film you will see references to the two characters back stories and elements of their previous movies as well Jason going into Freddy's domain on Elm Street and Freddy on Jason's turf at Crystal Lake. As a fan of both characters and franchises this was just fun and exciting to see. The blood and gore in this film comes a plenty and by the gallons coming off the screen in some of the main scenes making FvJ one of the bloodiest and goriest movies in either series. As for the two main characters Freddy and Jason both of them are in top form in this one. Despite being in Hell for a long time and not having much power Freddy is still evil and diabolical as ever while at the same time cracking jokes in his typical mean spirited style. Freddy in this one is almost a mixture of the scary and dark sandman he was in Nightmare's 1,2,3 and 7 and the funny clown he was in 4,5 and 6. Freddy might not have a big body count in this one but he is still at his very best here. As for Jason he is still the same silent Hockey mask,Machete-welding mass murdering maniac we've all come to know and watch and in FvJ Jason is a non-stop force of nature in this one cause in the Friday films he kills anyone who gets in his way. Jason breaks bones as well as slices and dices his way through victims and he just keeps on going leaving a large body count in the process. If brutality had a face Jason would be it. The fight scenes between Freddy and Jason are intense,fierce and gory and is done in such a way you feel like either one of them could win or lose. You will be cheering during this no holds barred smack down. While the title characters are memorable the supporting characters are nothing to write home about and are basically filler for the movie and are just not memorable like the characters in the Elm Street films or even the characters Friday The 13ths. The ending of Freddy vs Jason is fantastic and memorable with some surprises and thrills that will have you cheering. A great conclusion.The cast is good. Robert Englund is excellent once again as Freddy Kruger,with Englund being evil and funny at the same time. Ken Kirzinger is brilliant as Jason Voorhees,with Kirzinger being intimidating and menacing. Monica Keena is good as Lori,the heroine of the film. Jason Ritter is fine as Will,Lori's boyfriend. Kelly Rowland(of Destiny's Child fame)is surprisingly alright as Kia,Lori's friend. Chris Marquette(Linderman),Brendan Flecher(Mark),Katharine Isabelle(Gibb),Lochlyn Munro(Deputy Stubbs),Kyle Labine(Freeburg),Tom Butler(Dr. Campbell),Garry Chalk(Sheriff Williams)and Paula Shaw(Mrs Voorhees)give good performances as well.The direction by Ronny Yu is wonderful and stylish,with Yu giving the film a visually stunning look with different colors,camera angles and keeping the film moving at a tight pace. Great direction,Yu.The score by Graeme Revell is fantastic,big and matches the tone of the movie. Fine score,Revell.The Special and Practical Make-up effects are impressive especially with Freddy and Jason's make-up. Wonderful effects.In final word,if you love Horror films,Slasher movies,Freddy or Jason or both characters and their franchises,I highly suggest you see Freddy vs Jason,an excellent,entertaining and memorable Horror film that will thrill you and keep you entertained. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.",Freddy vs. Jason
143,PeterRoeder,"Welcome to my world, bitch!",7,7 November 2003,"I saw this movie today. It was very entertaining. I loved the ""Friday"" movies when I was a kid. As a teenager I was impressed by the ""Elm Street"" movies as well. This movie is certainly much better than the entirely parodic ""Jason X"". In every way, Freddy Vs. Jason is an extremely good movie, which I recommend. However, it does have a ""fatal"" (if I may be so free to use that expression!) flaw. It is not scary. It has no real horror atmosphere. It is essentially an ACTION MOVIE with a few chilly stuff, maybe two or three scary scenes. Those scenes are, I think, entirely related to the Elm Street side of the story. Remember ""Camp Crystal"". It has always astonishes me that the camp has never been closed down although many people are killed there every year. In the original movies it has atmosphere. It was NATURE. You know, guys, NATURE. Woods, forests, the lake, cabins. It was like going on that trip yourselves. You felt like you were there at the lake by the forest. This movie makes some extremely clever twists at the end, where we go to back to ""Camp Crystal"". However, as I am hinting at, the place no longer has any natural atmosphere. Now it´s just a set. The ""Friday"" movies of the 80s were, and still are, extremely scary. They are not action movies. They are genuine horror movies. When Jason as a kid jumps out of the lake towards the end of the first ""Friday"" it is very shocking. There is no such shocks at all, in Freddy vs. Jason. It is as if the producers have no interest in real horror, but want to make a very good action picture in the style of, say, ""Die Hard"". That really sucks for us horror fans, that has to see real horror elsewhere, for example, in the Japanese version of ""The Ring"". 7/10 user ratingPeter, Copenhagen",Freddy vs. Jason

Characters, plot lines & legends you love always end up getting butchered by some ill-conceived money-hungry idiot billionaire-- ""Short Circuit 2,"" ""Halloween 43,"" and ""Batman & Robin"" just being the examples that come to mind.""F vs. J"" did not suck.  It didn't have an incredible style to it, really, or anything special (save for Freddy's ""I'm Really Angry"" scene, or as it's known in the trailer, ""Where Freddy jumps 40 feet in the air.""), but I didn't roll my eyes more than twice, and the title characters are still the same nasty dudes that made them famous.  Robert Englund doesn't get enough credit... he can ACT.  Even if his writers can't WRITE.Stupid things to say for a horror movie, I know.  But Freddy was a wiseguy, and Jason was a hulking, non-hesitating butchering machine, and that's what we expect.  Personally, I think they dropped the ball on not showing how Freddy found Jason, or how either of them got out of Hell.  But whatever.Breasts, blood and bad acting.  It didn't exceed my expectations as I would have hoped, but it did meet them more or less dead-on.  I give it a ""B."" (8/10)p.s. Somebody get me Gibb's phone number?  Hot damn...

145,flingebunt,Just who are the good guys,6,9 March 2005,"The problem with ""vs"" movies is that the 2 people fighting each other are bad guys. In Alien vs Predator this is a big problem. The humans are irrelevant and do you really care who wins, do you care about the Alien or the Predator.In the mummy returns the mummy must fight the scorpion king and so they make him a sympathetic character.In Freddy vs Jason they do something similar. The question then is, who of these two spawn of hell deserve to win. Also the ordinary human characters matter to the story. They must are faced with these 2 horrors and must think of a way of destroying them both.There is nothing new here really, teenagers getting killed for obvious reasons in gruesome ways. Good old fashioned blood soaked fun.Watch it with a group of friends, take bets on who will win the battle (and of course you can other betting systems too, who dies, when they die, how they die, what order and so on).",Freddy vs. Jason
146,Donatien3,Freddy Saves this Underwhelming Slasher,6,14 November 2020,"This anticipated team up between two of 80s/90s horror's biggest names could have been a gory good time. It is for a while, but it takes three-quarters of the movie to get to the titular Freddy vs Jason fights.The first hour is devoted to too much exposition (explaining the backstories of Freddy and Jason) and generic slasher victims who we don't really care about.The good news is the Freddy v Jason fights make up for it: there's lots of blood and gore, and they take turns fighting each other in Freddy's dreamworld and Camp Crystal Lake (where Freddy has to get inventive with his surroundings).If nothing else, this movie proves that Robert Englund is the one true Freddy. Ten years after ""New Nightmare"", Englund clearly has a ball playing Freddy again: while he's not as ridiculous or slapstick-y as he was in some of the later Elm St sequels, he still cracks a few joke as he tries to take down Jason. All of this carnage is backed by a brilliant metal/hard rock soundtrack.",Freddy vs. Jason
147,Rendanlovell,Needs polish,4,26 July 2020,"Really wish I could say this was better. Compared to the majority of the Friday the 13th movies this one has a lot more personality. That is in large part thanks to Freddy. Robert englund is back and as tongue in cheek as ever. However there is a lot of style here as well, which gives it more watchability then what I'm used to seeing in these. The camera whips about like a wild animal and characters are frequently thrown around on wires like an over the top anime.This team up between Freddy and Jason is actually a lot of fun. They have completely opposite styles of killing which gives each kill a little more diversity. Jason uses brute force and is very blunt, whereas Freddy toys with his victims using fear tactics to prey them. Their polar opposite means of dispatch gives the kills in this a lot of fun variety.And boy is the body count in this high. Person after person is butchered by Jason or used to give some slapstick levity when Freddy takes care of them. People get sliced in half, electrocuted, and even folded in half Part 6 style. It's a supremely goofy ride that culminates in a scene where Jason is thrown around Freddy's boiler room like a cgi ping pong ball. Complete with classic pin ball sound effects.That's the good stuff really, and the only real entertainment in this. In terms of a Freddy Vs Jason movie, you get exactly what you'd expect. Freddy and Jason action with Freddy carrying the film on his scrawny shoulders, sending one liners towards the audience at a hundred miles an hour. It knows how goofy it is and plays it up to absurdity.However, this is an unfortunately rough movie for the most part. For having a 25 million dollar budget there are parts that look utterly unfinished. Not to mention the constant, unflattering slow motion. This came out the same year as Return of The King which still looks good today. This features some of the worst visual effects I've seen in a mintue. Any and all visual effects are horrifically dated. Like the slug monster that smokes with the stoner dude. That looks like an SNES game.Speaking of rough elements the dialogue is pretty bad. Aside from Freddy, who is chewing the scenery, these wet blankets can't deliver anything convincingly. But honestly, that may come with the early 2000s territory, where everything was terrible. Fashion, music, slow motion, and especially CG. Which is all on full display in this.There's quite a bit of entertainment to be had in this though. Yes, it's dated and filled with nonsense but I'm here for the goofiness at the end of the day. And there's a lot of that. Watching Jason use Freddy's amputated arm as weapon will never not be funny. Whether that was intentional or not is up for debate.",Freddy vs. Jason

Then Jason kills too much kids from Elm Street and Freddy and Jason fight. Even though they are both evil, I found myself rooting for Jason, which is weird because I normally don't like Jason. There are some good kills and the fight that they have is cool, but this is an average slasher film. But I have to admit this is way better than Jason X or Halloween Resurrection. The ending is weird. Jason coming out of the lake with Freddy's severed head in his hand. Then the head winks.

It may not be a piece of heavy handed pop-philosophy that thinks it's more clever than it is, or some unknown French art-house movie filled with daft editing techniques that film students drool over, it's not big and it's certainly not clever, but what Freddy versus Jason lacks in film making credibility it makes up for in sheer fun. And the end result is one of the most downright enjoyable flicks you can ever settle down with on a beer and pizza night.Sure, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street may have been horror films through and through, but their respective sequels did away with all sense of fear and replaced them with riotous crowd pleasing murder-o-ramas years ago, so to expect anything other than more of the same, only LOUDER from this movie is frankly ridiculous.Indeed, Freddy Versus Jason delivers exactly what it says on the tin. You get two hours of blood, guts, violence and heaving breasts struggling beneath tight clothing capped off by two slasher icons beating the living hell out of each other for twenty five minutes at the end. The body-count is ludicrously high and having seen it numerous times now (both sober and not-so-sober), the only complaint I can think of is that Kelly Rowland says ""y'all"" too much.

150,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Return of Freddy Krueger a true follow up to A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,10,1 February 2019,"The movie and the story is about Freddy (Robert Englund) who is in hell no one remembers him, he is powerless now. So he try's to manipulate and control Jason (Ken Kirzinger). He's discusing him self as Jason's mother (Paula Shaw) in Jason's dreams. He's telling Jason as his mother to go to Springwood and kill's some kids. With each kill Jason does in Springwood gives a Freddy a lot of more power. The parents thinks when Jason kills one of the kids that Freddy is back. One of these kids gets sent to asylum Westin Hills and he is given a Hypnocil, which is a dream suppressing, people can not dream of Freddy. They basically want everyone to take this dream surpassing.It doesn't work out that well, when Freddy gains all his power and Jason finds out that Freddy was using him. Towards the end of the film, there are some fight scenes, I think there are three battles between Freddy and Jason. Mostly is Jason killing in stead of Freddy killing. Towards the end of the film, you have this big epic finale, epic battle between Freddy and Jason. We don't really know who is wining, is almost like a tie. The girl Lori Campbell (Monica Keena) cuts Freddy's head off. On the end of the film wee see Jason rise up from the water in the lake, he is walking towards the shore and we see him holding Freddy's head and Freddy winks at the camera and that's how this film ends.I enjoy this film I love this film to death, I had a lot of fun with this film. It was a movie that I talk about in grade school. We always talked with friends it was always discussion with friends Freddy fighting Jason. both franchise were really popular at that time. Basically fans made this film, fans always talk about this film, I was really glad that they made this film. For so long they talk about the end of Jason Goes to Hell, Freddy's glove comes up and pull's Jason's hockey mask. They were working on a script since the year 1987 and they finally made the film in 2003. They went a lot of scripts. Some of the scripts I read there is one were Freddy and Jason goes to hell and Pinhead shows up.It would be a good idea, that would be a cool scene Freddy and Jason fighting in hell, that would be a cool setting for a sequel. There suppose to be a sequel to Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash. Character from the Evil Dead trilogy. That would be cool too, I never read the comic book series. I never know how it ends. The film has good fighting scenes. If you like Freddy and Jason you will really like this film. There are a lot of gore, good fighting, good nudity in the film, you have a sex scene I like. The acting is good the story is good. I enjoy this film I love this film to death.It is my fifth personal favorite Elm Street series. Ronny Yu directed the film well. This movie is reference to a Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. It mentions Westin Hills, Hypnocill and famous cool lines for Part 3, like ""Welcome to my world b***h"" sounds familiar that is why I think it is true follow up to Part 3. I enjoy the film more than part 5.6, 7 and the remake. Monica Keena as Lori Campbell and Jason Ritter as Will Rollins were good I like both of them. They help Jason to fight Freddy I like the idea. I love this film to death. I love When Darkness Falls by Killswitch Engage the song playing on the end of credits. My favorite slasher horror film of all time.",Freddy vs. Jason
151,dommercaldi,"This Film Is Awful. How Anyone Can Give This Above Two Stars Max, Is Beyond Me",1,11 October 2020,"Pros:
1. The costume design for Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) and Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) is really good, particularly the prosthetics applied to Robert Englund.Cons:
1. The special effects come across as really corny in their execution and they're definitely dated.
2. The editing is over-the-top at times, especially with the implementation of the pointless slow-motion.
3. There are far too many characters which means that not only are most of them given nothing to do, but no character development takes place so their deaths feel hollow.
4. The film, tonally, is massively confused. It can't decide whether it wants to be a horror or a comedy, so it tries to be both. It ends up being neither as the intended horror moments feel comedic, and the intended comedy moments are horrific in their lack of humour.
5. The jump-scares are entirely forced and they fail to land every single time.
6. Most of the acting is really stale, especially in regards to Kelly Rowland (Kia Waterson) and Monica Keena (Lori Campbell).
7. The dialogue is extremely clunky and it's painful at times to listen to.
8. The blood and gore looks so fake it's almost cartoonish, as well as just being unaesthetic to look at.
9. The cinematography is ridiculously bland, and there is an overeliance on out-of-place dutch angles.
10. The soundtrack is terrible as it doesn't suit the substance of the movie at all, and it feels as if it was inserted because the director (Ronny Yu) thought it sounded cool.",Freddy vs. Jason

You have one famous monster here and another over there, both doing well in their own franchise and then some Suit decides to cross breed movie characters. From Wolf Man meets Frankenstein to Aliens vs Predators which brings us to Freddy vs. Jason. I stayed away from this movie when it was first release, but after viewing it last night, I'm sorry I did. This worked. Well written, true to the fans of both monsters, and nicely executed by director Ronny Yu. The experience was enhanced by a deeper look into the souls of Jason and Freddy. We see Freddy before the parents kill him, we see Jason reduced to a child cowering from the water, and in the final dream scene, we see the events leading up to Jason's death. God, the counselors were just having stand-up sex on the porch of the cabin while others were around -- No wonder Mrs. Voorhees killed the oversexed teeny boppers. In short we are given reasons to like, fear, loath and empathize with these guys, making for a far better 'trip'. The non-monster kids were great though I really would have liked more of them to have survived. Especially the last two. Kelly Rowland was great. She let Freddy have it with both barrels, talking him upside his head. Too bad she had to bite it. It you're a fan of either monster, this movie is for you. Who won? Neither. The fans won! On a personal note, Betsy Palmer should have played Mrs. Voorhees. She's still alive and it would been the icing on the cake. Evidently there was a money issue. Too bad. Sometimes money shouldn't matter, especially were 'art' is on the line. Yes, this is art, maybe not the kind of art that showcases Van Gogh or Goya but it is still an art form!",Freddy vs. Jason
155,coconutkungfu-30704,Fun For Fans,6,20 February 2020,"If you are a fan of either franchise this one will have some entertainment value as a film. It delivers what you would expect from a decent slasher while simultaneously sparking the fun debate of ""who won?""Recommended for fans only.",Freddy vs. Jason
156,Darkest_Rose,Boring and Ridiculous Crap,5,18 August 2003,"Freddy(Robert Englund) and Jason(Ken Kirzinger) are back and this time they are killing dumb teenagers which suck at acting and also don't really have to do anything with the story. But also this time, Freddy and Jason are fighting against each other, in a rather ridiculous and boring fight. Well, one thing that comes to my mind after thinking about is movie is ""Boring"". This movie had really nothing to offer me, sure, there was lots of blood and people getting hacked into pieces but who cares? I wanted to see this movie and I especially chose the midnight show because I wanted to get scared but no luck for me. Instead, the whole audience including me kept laughing at how dumb this movie is. The acting was also really horrible, the only good actor I think was Robert Englund. Anyways, if you enjoy watching nonstop boring fights that include stabbing people a million times then this movie is for you. But if your like me, and enjoy getting scared and like a good horror movie that doesn't have to include gallons of blood, skip it. I would give Freddy Vs.Jason 5/10.",Freddy vs. Jason

158,Jerghal,They might be dead after all,6,9 February 2014,"Putting 2 iconic horror villains together in one movie doesn't mean the movie will be twice as good. They did invent a reasonably plausible story/excuse to pull Jason into Freddy's world (it's more a Freddy movie than it is a Jason flick). The scary/dark element is long lost (we all know what both of them look like as they have been in 1100 movies) and we get more focus on violence than fear of the unknown. Ronny Yu did provide some nice references to both previous Freddy and Jason films for the fans. All in all it was more enjoyable than I thought but believability has become a serious problem as Jason clearly can't die (they even spell it out in the film) and Freddy has died so many times (they even promised it in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare) we're not buying it anymore. The young actors are nothing more than cannon fodder for both killers so when one or more of them dies we couldn't care less. I guess the studio realized they exhausted/overextended the franchise and went to a reboot instead of a sequel to this one. A sound idea but unfortunately we all know how that 2010 film turned out. I guess Freddy might really be dead (for the film audience anyway). I would say bring on the next generation but it already has by truckloads with Insidious, Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring etc.",Freddy vs. Jason
159,galahad58-1,Bad vs Horrible,2,31 October 2013,"This is easily one of the worse films ever made. The acting is so far below average that anyone involved in this mess should never be allowed to participate in films ever again. The direction is pitiful. The script is one of the worse ever written. The dialog is horrible and some of the dumbest lines I have ever seen are in this film. The fact that a lot of people are killed and the survivors do not want to call the police, they go home like nothing happened, and go about their business like they were at a dance and not a mass killing is so stupid. There isn't one single positive in this movie and it is not worth watching. The DVD would make a good coaster for a beer or a soda though since the content is all wet anyway.",Freddy vs. Jason
160,meathookcinema,As dreadful as Kelly Rowland's recording career,1,16 October 2018,"I remember going to see this back in the day and walking out halfway through. Will I make it through this film this time? Will I feel the same as I did back in 2003?Well, yes I did (somehow) watch it all the way to the end. And yes, I feel the same as I did way back when.This no-brainer feels like prior to filming someone told director Ronny Yu what happens in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and then what happens in the Friday the 13th series as he hadn't seen any of the films. He then made a movie. A big budget, CGI laden turkey.I hate that they didn't use Kane Hodder. I hate that they didn't use Betsy Palmer. I hate that they DID use Kelly Rowland. Could her 'acting' career be as putrid as her 'music'? Erm, yep!. And did she have to use the 'F' word in a line that apparently she ad-libbed? It was great watching her die. This film was made for fanboys rather than fans of either series. A fanboy of F13th and NOES will love anything that has Freddy or Jason in it regardless of quality (like the Halloween fans who like any of the sequels after Part 3). A fan of the series will know the films, characters and plots of a franchise inside out and even try to establish a timeline even when this isn't strictly possible. New Line wanted a big, dumb multiplex movie that would attract huge audiences and take in megabucks. They got their wish.",Freddy vs. Jason
161,Toronto85,Freddy vs. Jason,7,20 March 2011,"Freddy vs. Jason is the long awaited film surrounding the battle of these two horror icons from the eighties. The story really began in Jason Goes to Hell where Freddy grabbed Jason's mask and pulled it down to hell. So for years they've been in hell when all of a sudden, Freddy decides to trick Jason into bringing Freddy ""back to life"". Freddy gets Jason to kill a few people in Springwood in an attempt to make them remember Freddy. You see, Freddy lived on the fact that people feared him. For many years, he was forgotten therefore had no way of killing more teenagers. Eventually Freddy gets resurrected, but Jason is stealing his thunder so to speak. Freddy wants to do some killing and realizes he must destroy Jason in order to be the ""top dog"" of mad slashers. The two battle off in a fun filled finale.FVJ is a pretty fun movie for fans of the original movies. The idea of putting these two up against each other has apparently been tossed around since the late eighties. I always look at this film from two perspectives. Being a Jason fan and being a Freddy fan. FVJ seems to be written more towards being a Nightmare sequel then a Friday film. The main setting is Elm street in Springwood. There are so many nightmares and references to dreams including a dream drug named ""hypnocil"" which was introduced in Nightmare 3. Freddy even gets a cool intro rehashing his character's history. It just all around feels like the film was made to be more of a Nightmare on Elm St than a Friday the 13th film.I guess for New Line Cinema, the Elm st series is more their baby while they didn't purchase the rights to F13 until Paramount gave up on the films after Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan. This is a MAJOR improvement from some of the later sequels made involving Freddy and Jason for sure. It isn't the best horror flick of all time, most of the characters are uninteresting and kind of annoying. It also isn't scary at all, it's actually more of a comedy. But when watching a movie pitting Freddy and Jason against each other, you expect many laughs (especially from the quotable Freddy played by Robert Englund).7/10",Freddy vs. Jason
162,kevinxirau,War of the Slashers!,7,21 July 2012,"Honestly, I'm no fan of slasher movies because before I thought they were all the same (in some ways they are), but nevertheless I was intrigued by this idea. The Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th series were fairly unique among the other slasher series and to see them cross over is a cool experience. We have Freddy Kruegar, the sadistic living nightmare, going up against Jason Vorhees, the indestructible super-strong zombie. Two individuals with different origin stories with one goal: kill, Kill, KILL! It's funny to note that this crossover was coming from the start the moment that Freddy makes a cameo at the end of ""Jason Goes to Hell."" The result is Freddy versus Jason.Plot: Freddy's in hell and some of the townspeople back at Elm Street are now wise to his tricks and made precautions so he can't come back. Not one who likes to be denied a good slaughter-fest, Freddy resurrects Camp Crystal Lake's very one Jason Vorhees and tricks the zombie into causing havoc and instilling fear into the locals so he can come back. While this proves successful, Jason just can't stop killing and starts doing away Freddy's intended victims. It all leads to an all-out brawl between two of the most famous mass-murdering icons in film history.Fans of slasher flicks will instantly recognize some clichés here: blood, sex, mild comedy, teenage stereotypes, and, of course, unstoppable killers. Whether you like the victims or not is up to you, but for me the titular characters steal the show. There are some pretty extreme death scenes and there fun to watch, from Freddy's dream world scenarios to Jason's deadly creativity. Freddy, played for the final time by Robert Englund, is one evil dude and is pretty funny. Jason, the more sympathetic of the two, is just a beast, unstoppable and ever so determined to leave his bloody mark. The big fight scenes between the villains are just so awesome, and I mean that they really mess each other up, blood and destruction everywhere. This is almost as good as King Kong versus Godzilla! Music is also really good, excellent choice of soundtrack.Overall, this is a fun, action-packed blood bath. This is one of the best movies with the word ""versus"" in it. Definitely worth a watch if you're into horror.",Freddy vs. Jason
163,lthseldy1,One of the funniest horror movies I have seen in awhile...,7,26 August 2003,"This movie was one worth watching and one that was more fun to watch in quite awhile.  It had it's real funny moments (won't tell which scenes though) that really had me rollin'.  It  was nice to see both Freddy and Jason together sense it's been a long time sense the last Freddy movie and it hasen't been that long ago sense the last time a Jason movie came out. It was a typical slasher film with all the blood and guts to make the average slasher fan like me happy.  And the ending had a great ""twist"".  I would recommend that you go see it and maybe even own it.  It's a classic.",Freddy vs. Jason
164,pivic,Clichés and mind-numbing beyond human comprehension,1,20 August 2003,"I do not think one can blame this on the director or the writers. Somewhere along the road, somebody with enough commercial wit would come along to pen or direct this charade, yet I somehow doubt anybody could do it worse than has been done here.The film is strewn with clichés. Every girl is a slutty vamp, only there to scream. Every male is designed to be macho, ending up dead in a variety of ways. Sure, this is the norm when speaking of Jason films (not all the Freddy ones, though) yet this is much worse.The following is written by me, assuming you have some experience of trash western ""civilisation"" cinema. Imagine the simplest one-on-one synopsis. Add teenagers. Add the most likely one-liners, then think beyond that, if you can. Add nude females (as no naked bodies are shown here, ooh no, that's too dangerous), idiots, a Jay (as in ""Jay and Silent Bob"") copy (although badly written, to the extreme), more bad one-liners and a massively bad story, very un-sympathetic characters and  idiocy bordering to the inevitable. Also, one must add the terrible music, which does nothing for the film; dreadful ""hardcore"" American rock.This film is among the worst I have ever seen, and I expected a very low outcome this time around.

166,dormesher-21565,"""Got Your Nose""........ Great film",8,29 January 2020,Freddy vs Jason. A great film bringing these two horror icons together in one film for the first with a simple story thats great and decent characters this is a thrill from start to finish.Freddy is brilliant in this one hes back to the way he was in Dream Warriors sinister and scary but has the funny one liners. The mix of horror and Comedy is back which is Freddy at his best. Its also my favourite design for Freddy it's modern but classic and i love it.Jason is also great in this one and it's a great simple design for him he also has the most kills in the movie which is annoying for a Freddy fan but works well for the story.The other characters are great abit generic but they work well for the story Laurie is definitely the highlight of this group and her backstory involving Freddy is pretty interesting.Now sometimes the film can be a little cheesy and I don't like the fact that Freddy doesn't get more kills in the movie but the kills he does get are pretty great and like i said it does work for the movie. Also it kinda dosent make sense that Jason is scared of water i get what they was going for but he goes in water in most of his own movies.Love the idea of Freddy using Jason to bring the fear back into Elm Street so he can grow stronger such an interesting idea and i also love the Idea of everyone covering up Freddy hiding all records of him and whoever dreams about him is taken to Westen Hill and forgotten about it's a great way to forget Freddy and beat him.The fights are definitely the best moments it's great seeing these two horror icons just slash each other and its fun to watch for any horror fan.Verdict 8.4/10 a great film with a great story and its just fantastic to see these two horror icons on the screen. Just a fun film from start to finish.,Freddy vs. Jason
167,iwatcheverything,Greatest Comedy This Year,7,18 August 2003,"Don't worry no spoilers here.I have grown up and watched every movie both of these two maniacs have made. The farther it gets into the series the cheesier they get.  But, that is what I love about these films.  The originals of both of these movie icons are some of the most frightening of all time but if you go into this movie don't expect to jump at all.Freddy still has his humor but it is lacking what it was in most of the Nightmare series.  The jokes he made before killing someone were not near as funny as the older ones.I would like to say I do not think that Hollywood really knows how to make a real good horror movie anymore.  It's not about the gore it's about making you jump out of your seat and have bad dreams.So if you want to watch an entertaining film with a lot of boobs and gore and laugh from beginning to end at the silliness of it all this movie is for you.I will be adding it to finish my collection of all of their films.",Freddy vs. Jason

Not the best but enjoyable. I know it's better than Alien vs Predator because this one is enjoyable. It's better than Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice (2016) to be honest. Freddy almost win but he's been put out in the dream world and Jason win. Okay now that's out of the way now I want to say the story is spot on, the writting is alright, and the characters are not anoyying which is a good thing.

169,lotus_chief,"After the long, long wait, this movie delivers! **SPOILERS INCLUDED!**",8,17 August 2003,"***SPOILERS BELOW!***I heard about the possibility of this film being made years ago.  I wrote it off, as it never came to be.  When I first saw the preview of Freddy vs. Jason, I was AMPED!  After seeing the finished product, this film has made BOTH the Freddy & Jason franchises better.  It was great seeing 2 of the most prolific horror/slasher movie characters go against each other.  The story, surprisingly, was very engaging.  The acting, of course, wasn't very good, but you're not looking for Oscar-worthy performances in a movie like this.  When I saw Kelly Rowland in the film, I wanted her to be the first to dieshe's just horrible!  Who decided to cast her in this film anyway? 
Freddy Kruger made this movie, as expected.  It's only logical that he win' the battle between him and Jason.  He's the smarter of the two, is pretty strategic, and can get in your head!  There's no stopping that.  I would've liked Freddy to get more kills, but the fact that he didn't is all explained in the story, so I can accept that.  Jason was as cold as ever, and they expanded on his character as well.  We finally see what weakness Jason has. The film centered around Freddy, which was a smart move.  I'm a big fan of Freddy, so I was rooting for him to win.  It's not that I don't like Jason, but between the two it seems likely that Freddy wins.  Now, for the showdown..The fights between the two were great!  Jason got more kills than Freddy, but that was the plan after all.  Like Freddy said, 'Jason will get the blood, but I'll get all the glory!'  The fights went back and forth, and it was VERY entertaining.  I've read people say that the end scene was a dream that Jason was having.  I don't know if that's the case, but I don't think either one of them truly won'.  But that's okay, because it leaves room for a  sequel and I can't wait for it.  You have to go in to this movie knowing you're not going to get a Shining' type of film, but being that I'm a fan of Freddy, and Jason, this movie was very good.  Of course, the clichés of horror films were all over it, but with a original (surprisingly) story to the thought-to-have-been-overdone' franchises, I enjoyed Freddy vs. Jason a lot.but it's only recommended for fans of both series.  *** out of **** stars.Best kill = Kelly Rowland.I was waiting the whole movie for her to die, and boy did she GET IT!!!  Better yet, it was caused by BOTH Freddy & Jason!",Freddy vs. Jason
170,DustinRahksi,Simply awesome.,5,19 November 2012,"Now this is what i'm talking about, a versus movie that is done right, and more enjoyable than most of the franchises sequels. The characters are disposable as always, the plot is simple, and story moves along nicely. The amount of violence in this film is through the roof. The fight scenes between Jason and Freddy are a horror fans dream, they beat hell out of each other. Now if only they could bring leather face into the mix It would be a dream come true. This film is by no means a great film, but it is extremely entertaining and well worth paying for the DVD.Anyone looking for a good time should watch this movie, one of the best in either of the franchises.",Freddy vs. Jason
171,MF210,"The battle is definitely worth seeing, the rest of the film is another story",5,23 April 2004,"My Rating: ** out of ****. The concept of Freddy vs. Jason is actually pretty good. Neither one of the series is really that popular anymore. Why not just let the killers hack the hell out of each other. However, how long could a film like that actually last? I'd say about 20 minutes, 30 at the absolute most. Unfortunately, the film runs about 90 minutes. The problem with Freddy vs. Jason is that although the concept is good, its just not enough for a full motion picture. The screenwriters try and tell a plot that can kindly be described as dull and dumb. The stars of this film are supposed to be the killers, not some annoying teenagers (who take up way too much time). The only thing worthwhile about the teenagers is that we do see a pair of very nice breasts. I will give director Ronny Yu (who directed one of my favorite guilty pleasures, Bride of Chucky) some credit. He uses an approach similar to the one he used for Bride of Chucky: Never take anything too seriously. Theres some self-referential humor (Lochlyn Munro as a deputy was a brilliant move since he was in Scary Movie, a parody of the horror genre) and the dumb dialogue written by the screenwriters is occasionally funny. However, this approach doesn't always work and the film is occasionally yawn-inducing. 
The final 15 minutes are easily the best of the film and there the only reason to watch the film. Yu does a very good job with the battle scene. I just wish the film had been much shorter to get to the big 15 minutes.",Freddy vs. Jason
172,rob-236,`Carry on' Freddy,3,18 August 2003,"Plays like a `Carry on' film, I half expected Freddy to resurrect Kenneth Williams, never mind Jason Vorhees.Played for laughs all the way through (surely!), awful acting, dreadful storyline but very very funny. Lets face it, you could tune in half way into the film and not care as all everyone wants to see is Freddie and Jason fight.Obviously the makers of this film thought so too, and tacked on an awful storyline that runs like a reject script from Kevin Williamson. Scary as pillows, but worth a watch though as its absolutely hilarious  Freddy has well and truly turned into the clichéd pantomime villain. HE'S BEHIND YOU  SLASH!!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
173,CrassActionHero,Evil vs. Evil,8,18 December 2006,"Freddy vs. Jason(2003) Review: I saw this movie on opening night. The crowd was hot. Everybody has been waiting for Freddy and Jason to return. The battle. Winner kills all. Finally. Freddy and Jason meet.F vs.J is a romp. The movie starts with a telling of our evils. We get to see some old school shots from previous Nightmare on Elm St. movies which was a nice touch. Excellent nostalgia. If you are unfamiliar with both Freddy and Jason's past, this movie gives excellent character development. F vs.J is also surprisingly intelligently written. The writers here studied the old movies very well. Kudos.The setup is Freddy is powerless. If he is forgotten, it's over. He grows power on fear. He invades Jason's mind. Jason rises back and begins a killing spree. When Elm st. is once again in fear, Freddy is the first thing mentioned. The police believe it's Kruger. Clever. Use Jason to spread fear. Gain power. However, Freddy brought Jason back. Now Jason is doing the killing. Freddy wants all of the killing himself. The war is on.Robert Englund is back as Freddy. Not only that, but in rare form. Englund is having a blast reprising his role as Freddy. I think this is Englund's best performance as Freddy yet. Jason is still quite creepy. The creature from Crystal Lake is back. At first, I was rooting for Jason. Before long, I was rooting for both! Freddy was a very likable villain here.The fight between Freddy and Jason is fun. To see speed vs. power is something. Do not forget that just because they are killing each other does not mean either one is not going to kill you too! This movie does have some funny moments too. One scene in particular is Jason killing off some drunk at a rave. The acting was okay, with the exception of Englund. Jason Ritter on the other hand was awful. His facials were bad. He had poor delivery. He had no aura. Plain bad.One more thing is the ending. The directing of the ending was awesome! The imagery was just killer. The theater loved it too. As a matter of fact, The theater gave this movie a round of applause! No joke! I did too. A trip down memory lane. I had fun.DVD alternate ending: I prefer the theatrical version hands down. Even the director admitted that the alternate ending sucked.The Last Word: Welcome back Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees! This movie lived up to my expectations. There are times when the cheese starts to fly, but that's okay. Not as often as you think. F vs.J delivers. Killer fun.",Freddy vs. Jason
174,HorrorFan1984,Freddy Vs. Jason,7,12 April 2020,"The much anticipated battle of horror begins as it's Freddy Vs. Jason in a winner take all fight to the death.With Jason X having taken place AFTER this film chronologically, we last left off with Jason Voorhees being dragged down to hell by Freddy's claw in the 9th film of the Friday the 13th series. As for Krueger, we haven't seen the character since he was sent to hell by his daughter in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.We start this one by seeing Jason living a repetitive hell at Crystal Lake where he murders the same campers over and over again. Freddy appears as his mother, which we all know is Jason's weakness, and tells Jason to go to Elm Street to kill the children. Freddy's motivation is that he can't come back in people's dreams unless they are scared of him. The plan is to have Jason kill on Elm Street and for Freddy to get all the blame and glory which would resurrect him into their nightmares.We meet our main crew of teenagers, including our lead heroine Lori. After Jason murders a few of them, the adults start mentioning Freddy Krueger as a possible suspect considering the terror he brought to Springwood years ago. Once he is mentioned, Lori has a nightmare about man with knives for fingers. Freddy is back! Despite appearing in teenagers nightmares, he still isn't strong enough to kill - luckily he has Jason for that for the time being.Meanwhile, we are re-introduced to Westin Hills the psychiatric hospital that we last saw in Part 3. The staff are giving the patients Hypnocil, the once experimental drug that Nancy Thompson took to suppress her nightmares. Lori's ex-boyfriend Will is stuck in there after seeing Freddy kill someone. Will escapes and connects with Lori, which prompts them and other friends to fight back against Freddy and Jason. During all of this, we have Freddy Krueger battling with Jason Voorhees for ultimate glory as the biggest and baddest horror villain of all time. Who will out do the other? And will any of the Elm Street children survive?Freddy Vs. Jason is a very good movie bringing two of the most legendary on screen serial killers together to do battle. Being a fan of both series' , there are definite flaws. One being that New Line Cinema doesn't hide their bias for Freddy over Jason in my opinion. It's to be expected considering they created that character while as Paramount was in charge of most of the Friday films.Also, this isn't scary to me anyways which I guess it doesn't have to be. It's a fight film with the two killers facing off against each other. The final battle between Freddy and Jason is epic for sure. I really wanted both to succeed in the end because it would suck to see one of the series be truly over. Being a New Line film, we get tons of past Elm Street material including seeing Westin Hills again which I enjoyed. Many references to previous sequels are made.In terms of acting, we get Robert Englund back as Freddy Krueger for sadly the last time at this point. He rocks the role yet again, being creepy and comedic at the same time. Ken Kirzinger does a wonderful job as the creepy stalking Jason, I was fine with the switch from Kane Hodder to him. For the teens we get stellar performances from Monica Keena as Lori, talented singer Kelly Rowland as supportive best friend Kia, and Jason Ritter as Will.I highly recommend Freddy Vs. Jason to all horror fans. It is a great duel between the two legends, and we get plenty of teenage bloodshed along the way as well.7/10",Freddy vs. Jason
175,Torgo_Approves,"There can be only one, bitch!",6,23 August 2006,"(r#55)This movie opens with a child murderer being burnt to death by angry parents and cuts immediately to a hot girl showing her boobs before going skinny-dipping in a lake. She hears a creepy noise from the woods nearby, shouts ""Mike?"" in that lovely D-actress kind of way, puts on a shirt (only a shirt, no pants, nothing else) and runs into the woods before being stabbed by a murderer wearing a hockey mask. This alone should give you an idea of what kind of movie Freddy vs. Jason is. It's a B-movie masterpiece! Gallons of blood, bouncing boobs, awful actors in their early twenties pretending to be teenagers, you name it. This movie is just fun from beginning to end and should be on everyone's ""guilty pleasure"" list. If you haven't seen the Elm Street sequels (which were shock full of corny humour) or the Friday sequels (which were just plain awful), you will not be able to appreciate this movie. It takes a certain sense of humour and the right state of mind to really enjoy this fast-paced crap-fest.The children of Elm Street have forgot about Freddy Krueger, so the wise-cracking serial killer resurrects Jason Voorhees' body (face it, he will never die), sending him into another mindless killing spree (the best part is definitely when the dumbass boyfriend is crushed to death in his bed). I don't want to hear anything about plot holes, such as why Jason's corpse is just lying out in the woods when he was clearly pulled into the ground at the end of Jason Goes to Hell (appropiately). The almighty Freddy vs. Jason needs not worry about such minor nuisances as plot holes! The police force (sadly, John Saxon is nowhere to be seen) fear that Freddy might be back (who else would kill a guy in his own bed?) and soon the few remaining children of Elm Street start having nightmares. The man with the bad skin is back! Unfortunately, Jason just won't stop killing dumb teens, and Freddy realizes that something must be done! Hence... Freddy *vs.* Jason.Of course, the ""plot"" is just there as an excuse to kill brainless teenagers in the most gruesome and creative ways possible. The death scenes in this film (yes I just called it a ""film""! Bite me, film snobs!) are much funnier than the lame stabbings in the Jason sequels, although they can't beat most of the killings from the Freddy sequels, particularly those in the wonderful Part 3: Dream Warriors.The characters are all stereotypes, there's the token black girl, the white heroine, the cop, the stoner, the overweight comic relief, etc, etc. Like I said, they're just props waiting to be killed in some hilarious way.This film is the epitome of geekiness, combining boobs, blood, drugs, and pop culture heroes fighting to create the ultimate masterpiece of cheesiness. Highly recommended. The legendary Freddy could not have gone out in a flashier fashion!Now bring on ""Mike Myers vs. The Leprechaun""! ""Your eyes say 'no, no'... but my mouth says 'Yes! Yes!'"" ~Fred Krueger, 1984-2003. Rest in peace (?)",Freddy vs. Jason
176,Vampenguin,Mindless Slasher fun,7,10 May 2006,"*Spoilers*This movie is purely mindless slasher fun, and doesn't try to be anything more. The plot is just a flimsy pretext to get the two icons together, but it works pretty good and kept me at least somewhat interested throughout. The characters/actors are typical slasher fodder, no better or worse than usual. Like most post-Scream slasher films, it feels the need to poke fun at itself, however it does it more subtly than most with characters like Freeburg. Englund does a great job as always as the wise-cracking Freddy. Though the less wordy, serious Freddy from the first Nightmare film may be scarier, I really enjoy Freddy like this, spouting one-liners and catch phrases by the handful. The film isn't serious to begin with, and he really adds to that. I don't see why people complain about Ken Kerzinger, I think he did as good a job as anyone else that has played Jason...not like it would really take a lot to play that kind of part. The final battle between the icons is a tad disappointing, but I liked the outcome more than most. I was cheering for Freddy. Sure, Freddy technically loses, but I think that's a testament to him being the better villain: Think about it, the villain always loses in slasher movies. In that respect, I say Freddy won and rightfully deserved to. Overall this is a fun movie for a rainy day, thats it thats all. Don't be looking for something on par with the original Nightmare on Elm Street, but it's still a fun movie.7/10",Freddy vs. Jason

The film is definatly fun and it's no doubt that it will attract a wide and varied audience. The opening night crowd hailed down from a keg party. But let's tak about the film and lets address it's problems first The acting, oh god the horrible acting. It's sad when the best and  spunkiest performance comes from Kelly Rowland the only non actor of the group. As for the leads Jason Ritter and Monica Keena. They're like two blank canvas's trying to childishly paint eachother.  Granted that their backstories don't really matter but god n the decade we've been waiting to see this flick you figured they could've casted better. No one has any chemistry or believability at all.  Bringing the whole film down to an unnecessary comedic level at dramatic scenes.  The plot, there isn't really much of one but who cares.  You see what this film is really about is the fight and whoa, what a great one it is. Gory and unrelenting as they pound away at eachother. And that my friends was worth the wait. Although, ultimately a dissapointment the film does score with visual flair and a kick ass matchup. So although the build up maybe slow and lacking. The finsih is what it's all about. it's what had the audience clappping and cheering as they gleefully await the sequel.",Freddy vs. Jason

Robert Englund, Ken Kirzinger, Monica Keena, Kelly Rowland, Jason Ritter, Katharine Isabelle, Chris Marquette, Brendan Fletcher, Tom Butler, Lochlyn Munro. Considerably hokey, but entertaining blood-drenched slashfest pits two of horror's biggest icons, Freddy Krueger from the NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST. series and Jason Voorhees from the FRIDAY THE 13th series, against one another after a plot by Freddy (Englund) to use a resurrected Jason (Kirzinger) to kill children on Elm St. is foiled. New Line Cinemas wanted the filmmakers to make this gorefest `violent as hell' and they succeed in making one of the goriest films ever. The acting, of course, is inane to say the least, with a particularly awful performance by Keena as the `last girl.' What was originally a dead-in-the-water project in pre-production hell became a surprise box office hit, becoming the only film besides FINDING NEMO in 2003 to stay #1 at the box office for more than a single weekend.

181,w00f,Return of the Living Dead Franchises,8,16 August 2003,"I have to admit, I got bored with the whole Friday the 13th series after the second movie.  The same with Nightmare on Elm Street.  To me, they were boring and repetitious and I'd completely given up on them both.  It was with some trepidation that I set out to see Freddy vs. Jason.I'm glad I did.This is not a film that takes itself seriously.  How could it?  As much humor as blood dripped from the screen this time around.  Right from the opening credits, consisting of titles rising from buckets of blood and gore splashed liberally across the screen, any horror fan can tell that this film is going to be a parody of itself.  It flubs many a cheap-scare shot, and from what I could tell, this was completely intentional.  By the time it gets around to the climactic battle between Jason and Freddy, complete with it's Monty Pythonesque ""it's only a flesh wound"" bits (and pieces!), the audience is simultaneously overwhelmed by one of the most brilliant free-for-all monster fight scenes to ever slash its way across a screen and laughing out loud at the rapid-fire succession of in-jokes.Perhaps best of all, Freddy talks to the audience.  He just looks right into the camera and speaks to the theater.  Brilliant; of course Freddy loves an audience!  The ending sums the whole thing up perfectly.Great special effects and lots of fun for horror buffs.  If you ever loved Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th... even if you got as tired of the series as I was... go see this one.Personal note:  Why do people bring 3 and 4 year olds to see movies like this?  Folks, LEAVE THE KIDS HOME FOR THIS ONE.  This is NOT appropriate material for small children, who may well end up with night terrors after seeing this.  Any parent stupid and/or uncaring enough to bring any child under the age of 12 to this movie automatically wins a time share on Crystal Lake.  We ain't talkin' Disney here!",Freddy vs. Jason
182,joshuadrake-91275,The best movie crossover ever made,8,14 September 2015,"Freddy vs. Jason is a long awaited crossover film that I have long waited to see and both the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and Friday THE 13TH franchises finally came together.I loved the film as much as I wanted to and I first saw this film in 2003 but it took my sister LeeAnn, to realize a few years later that is just a man in makeup as well as Jason Voorhees.The story is very good, but some people says that is incoherent, but not to me. I thought the plot was very well written by Damian Shannon & Mark J. Swift. I actually read the original script and a lot of stuff had to be cut from the final version.The film begins with Freddy Krueger narrating that he's been living in Hell and that to regain his powers, he will need to use someone from Hell and he uses Jason Voorhees to kill kids for him until he regains his powers. However, after Freddy regains all of his powers, he tries to kill Jason in his dreams, but things go horribly wrong as a group of teenagers try to kill Freddy, but one teenager named Lori Campbell, goes into Jason's dreams to pull Freddy out of the dream and brings him back into the real world to fight Jason one last time and this leads into a very, very intense, bloody, gory and long fight between Krueger and Voorhees.I love the story. The story is very great, like I said, but I'm not gonna complain about the story. The one complaint I do have is about some of the comedy. I feel like they took some of it way too far in this film, but I also think it is really cool.The one part that really had me cracking up first time I saw this was the scene where Kelly Rowland's character, Kia, talks down to Freddy Krueger, but a lot of people hated that part. Freddy's weakness is fire, Jason's is water and that works in this movie as well. But again, I like some of the comedy, but some of the comedy is taken way too far in the film, but it works successfully.The acting can get stupid at times, but I will give credit to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, in his final appearance as Freddy Krueger and Ken Kirzinger as Jason Voorhees. They do such an incredible job and I could not be proud with the make-up designs for the two horror icons in this feature.Monica Keena plays Lori and she does alright. Jason Ritter, who is the late John Ritter's son, plays Will Rollins and he plays the part brilliantly. Kelly Rowland plays Kia and she is both serious and funny in her first film debut. Christopher George Marquette as Charlie Linderman is kind of a dumbass in this film, but I really like his performance.Lochlyn Munro plays the police officer, Deputy Stubbs and he does a good job until he is killed, but sometimes his performance is incredibly over-the-top. Katharine Isabelle plays Gibb and I will say, she is a very beautiful actress and I seen her in Bones, starring rapper-turned-actor Snoop Dogg and in this film. In this film, she does not have as much screen time, but she does put on a very damn good performance up until the moment that she is killed.Brendan Fletcher plays Mark and he is a little confusing to describe and I have trouble hating him. Paula Shaw plays Jason's mother and she does a great job, too. Odessa Munroe plays Heather, who is the girl at the lake at the beginning of the film that gets killed Jason Voorhees.Another major complaint is the teen kissing. The teen kissing is really amazing in this film, however, they take some of it way too far in this film, but they could have cut some of it out of the film. The original ending was to have Jason Ritter and Monica Keena's characters make out and the kissing gets a little intense until Freddy Kreuger's claw pops up out of Jason Ritter's character's hand and kill Lori with it. If you don't believe me, go out and buy th 2-Disc New Line Platinum Series DVD.The music by Graeme Revell is really amazing and it is very dark and serious, but the soundtrack is very amazing as hell with a lot of rock songs on the soundtrack including Ill Nino's ""How Can I Live"" and Killswitch Engage's ""When Darkness Falls"". The editing and visual effects are just top-notch. Cinematography is very good as well as the production design and costume design is very spectacular and really cool.Another complaint that this is a very dark movie. To me, this is not as dark as critics and fans says it to be and it is not as bad as the critics and some fans say it is. The movie is dark and too serious, but also really funny on some occasions.The film is rated R, like the other Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th films as well as some other horror films.Overall, Freddy vs. Jason is fun, dumb, scary, dark, violent, gory, bloody, fantastic and spectacular. The film is really cool and is very amazing. I know this has it's fan base, so if you like this film, that's fine, but if you hate this film, that's an issue.For all you non-scary movie fans, this is a movie that you need to see, but watch the other films in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and other films in the complete Friday the 13th franchise.This is one movie that definitely deserves to have a sequel made to it, hopefully, soon in the future.",Freddy vs. Jason

184,TheMovieDoctorful,More Fun Than A Barrel Of Monkeys,10,12 July 2015,"This. Movie. Is. Awesome. What else do you want me to say? I haven't had more fun since ""Conan the Barbarian."" I have been a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies and their iconic antagonist Jason Voorhees for as long as I can remember, and not only is this the only movie in the franchise to be even CLOSE to good since 1989, it's also the 3rd best installment in the series behind ""Jason Lives"" and ""The New Blood."" There wasn't a single moment watching this movie where I was even close to being bored, I dare ANYBODY who doesn't get squeamish at gore to watch this movie and NOT be entertained.First of all, I was genuinely surprised how much I loved this movie's story. It provides a far darker and more sinister view of just how far Springwood will go to keep the legend of Freddy Krueger a legend...Well, at least in the eyes of the townsfolk. There are 3 villains in this movie; Freddy, Jason and the fear of the townsfolk that blinds their judgment and compensates their morality. It's a clever idea, and it suggests that ""Freddy v.s Jason"" isn't as dumb as it looks. The story also provides some great motivation for the Springwood Slasher and the Boogeyman of Crystal Lake to cut each other to ribbons, painting Freddy Krueger as a string-pulling manipulator and Jason Voorhees as the main victim of Freddy's manipulations seeking revenge. It's not Shakespeare, but it's smarter than I expected and refreshing for people going into the movie with a cynical mind.The teenage characters are surprisingly likable and interesting as well. Unlike in many slasher flicks, I wanted almost all of the teens to get out of this mess alive. Jason Ritter is extremely sympathetic, likable and easy to root for as Will Rollins and the CRIMINALLY underrated Brendan Fletcher is equally so as his best friend Mark. Both of these characters are true victims of the town's ignorance and fear, sent to an asylum to shut them up from speaking up about two separate instances of carnage on Elm Street. For Will, it meant abandoning the love of his life, Lori, for years. Monica Keena is an excellent scream queen who can really emote when the script requires her too. I loved the vulnerability and innocence that she gave the character of Lori Campbell, it was impossible not to like her. And of course, Katherine Isabelle is as good in this movie as she is lovely...Okay, maybe not that good, but she gives a decent performance.Of course, the best performance in the movie has got to be Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger. The man steals the show in every movie he's in, and he's just as funny, scary, sadistic and entertaining here as he was in all the ""Elm Street"" movies preceding this.Of course, it's impossible to talk about ""Freddy v.s Jason"" without talking about the fight scenes. And BOY did I love these fight scenes. ""Freddy v.s Jason"" features some of the most well choreographed and entertaining fight scenes I have ever witnessed. The weapons and skill sets of both combatants are accounted for perfectly, it's impossible to watch the fights in this film and not be at least a little impressed.The movie looks great too. I thought that the red and blue color scheme (Red for Freddy symbolizing his death by fire and blue for Jason symbolizing his death by water) was creative, clever and provided the film with a nice, spooky atmosphere. And bravo on the set designers for truly making this feel like both a ""Friday the 13th"" film AND a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" film. We got Freddy's boiler room, the cabins and dock of Camp Crystal Lake, a creepy cornfield just BEGGING for a machete wielding maniac to hack up some frat boys. For a Friday fan, it's a visual treat.And finally, like the all the best entries in the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, ""Freddy v.s Jason"" is funny. Like really funny. Intentionally funny. The scene where Kelly Rowland's character is forced to give Jason mouth to mouth truly made me laugh out loud, as did Freddy's numerous perverted puns. These moments never feel out of place and always manage to get at least a smile.""Freddy v.s Jason"" is no masterpiece, but good God is it a roller coaster ride of fun. There are plenty out there who will dismiss it as brainless trash, but when brainless trash is not only THIS fun, but the acting and story are good enough that I don't feel guilty for liking it, all you can really do is smile, sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a ride this movie is.",Freddy vs. Jason
185,boyinflares,Not the best outing for either villain,7,26 December 2005,"After the ending of New Line Cinema's first Jason film Friday the 13th IX: Jason Goes to Hell, it was inevitable that this team up would occur. And according to the in-depth special features on the DVD of Freddy vs. Jason, the film spent a long time in the development stages. The final result is a good film, but not the best for either of the two franchises.The premise of the film is plausible and makes sense, and it is executed in a spectacular way, but at times the film is just plain boring. That can be attributed to the cast as well as the production crew. Robert Englund returns as Freddy, and gives a usually-great performance. However with the absence of his arch-foe Nancy (the terrific Heather Langenkamp), he doesn't seem to be all quite there. Jason gets much less screen-time than Freddy, possibly because he doesn't have anything to say, but the times he is on screen are often more interesting than Freddy. Kane Hodder who played Jason in Friday the 13th parts 7-10 is replaced by Ken Kirzinger, who gives a good performance. However the spectacular final battle between the two is rather lacking.The heroes and fodder of the film are a mixed bunch. Certainly the best of the teens would be Jason Ritter who plays Will. Monica Keena is a great actress (see her in Dawsons Creek as bad girl Abby for an example), but her performance here is seriously under-par, possibly because her character, Lori, is plain boring, and she certainly does not live up to previous Freddy/Jason heroines like the aforementioned Nancy (Langenkamp), Tina (Lar Park Lincoln) from Friday VII: The New Blood, or Alice (Adrienne King) from Friday the 13th part I.Kelly Rowland from super-star singing group Destiny's Child in her first acting appearance is good and her character Kia gets a lot of the best lines. Christopher Marquette is good as Charlie, and Katherine Isabelle as Gibb is under-used. Lochlyn Munro tries to show some authority as Deputy Stubbs and does a decent job, while Jesse Hutch plays hottie Trey, and unfortunately for both himself and the audience, he is killed off far too soon.There are some nods to the previous Friday and Nightmare films, more so to the Nightmare films. The film follows the usual slasher motifs of absent authority figures, though this time they are absent as they cannot be trusted. There is some female nudity, and the recent notion of having two survivors (the heroine and her love interest) continues with this film too. So while Freddy vs Jason is a good film, it just seems to be too blockbuster, lacking some of the ""treats"" the early Freddy and Jason films had due to their cheapness.",Freddy vs. Jason
186,Punk19,Excellent movie man!,10,23 July 2005,"Seeing this middle to end has really made an impact upon my life. I've always been a Chucky, Leprechaun and Pennywise fan. I always thought that no one could touch the way I felt about them. But I was wrong here.Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund)was once a legend. A legend that terrorized kids when they dream. But now the adults have found a way to make the killer stay away forever. Now he must find a way to get back up to his killing ways. But how? Finding Jason Voorhees(Ken Kirzinger)he tells him(he's Jason's mother)that he must go up to the top. Where he must kill to get kids to dream and think Freddy was back.But things go horribly wrong when Jason don't want to go back to hell. Freddy now has a problem. He doesn't want another killing stealing his thunder. So finding Jason in his dreams he and Jason fight.I find that even if you watch it from the middle to the end it's still a good watch.

187,chucknorrisfacts,Finally a worthy sequel!,6,21 October 2007,"There had been talk for years of a movie pitting Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street) and Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th) against one another. A lot of people suspected it was just talk, but in 2003, it finally happened.With a film such as this with so much hype, of course there are going to be high expectations. Although this film is not without its flaws, I'd say they did a pretty good job! I would definitely say it is the strongest sequel in either franchise.Most of all I was glad to see a quality sequel to a horror film, not another remake. Remakes have been done to death, and almost all of them (and by almost I mean 99.9%) are inferior to the original films from which they're based.There had been talk of a sequel featuring Ash Williams from the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. However, this never came to fruition nor did a sequel featuring Michael Myers from the ""Halloween"" franchise, which according to Robert Englund was another idea.I think the film does a fine job of depicting both main characters, Freddy and Jason. It doesn't feel as though the film really favored one too much over another, so both sets of fans will be happy. Overall, I'd say this is worth the rental, for both fans of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"".",Freddy vs. Jason
188,Zombified_660,Tries to do both villains justice but manages neither.,5,24 August 2005,"Freddy vs Jason was a really odd movie for me. I really enjoyed it, but it's a real mess of a film. In a similar fashion to Jason Goes to Hell, they really tried to push the envelope as to how complicated you could make a slasher movie, but they pretty much failed.My main grievance is that the movie is firmly unbalanced. Instead of running the two villains beside one another plotwise, the first half is like a Jason movie, then the second half is like a Freddy movie. If this was their plan, why not make Freddy 8 and Jason 11 instead of throwing out some hotchpotch Godzilla vs style movie. It would have made more sense than forcing the two together and rubbing everyone up the wrong way.I have a small personal grievance in that after the third movie I thought Freddy really sucked, so I'm none too happy about him coming back twice as stupid. He really is laughably unscary and really really cheesy in this film, and I know dyed in the wool Freddy nuts will dig that, but I'm a Jason man myself, and he just didn't get enough to do in this movie. By the way, minor grievance two: I think Katharine Isabelle rocks, but she was really underused in this movie. She could've fronted this movie in her sleep.Anyhoo, I've read up on this movie, and all the stuff that sucks, like them firing Kane Hodder, making Jason a 'misunderstood soul' as opposed to the machete-wielding nutter we're all used to and the overarching problem that really this is a Nightmare movie with Jason in it are pretty much Ronny Yu's fault, who much like the director of Jason Goes to Hell wanted to mess with the formula. Mr Yu, there's a reason they call it a formula, you get the right results. This is a failed experiment.All grievances aside, this is still pretty fun. It has some sweet deaths in it (mainly Jason, aside from one fairly screwed-up Freddy jobby that almost restored my faith in him) and they don't skimp on the gore either. It's nice to see Jason back with an 18 Certificate where he belongs. The Jason costume is pretty rad here too, easily one of the coolest Jasons, shame the costume's wasted on a fairly mediocre movie. If you like the two franchises, it's worth checking out, but if not I'd do one of two things: If you're interested in the franchises, watch the earlier films first, and if you've never been interested in Freddy or Jason but you heard FvJ was cool, I'd avoid it as it'll probably be indecipherable.",Freddy vs. Jason
189,ihateeverymovieisee,Expectations Exceeded,8,16 August 2003,"Freddy Vs. Jason will at least meet or exceed your expectations in the areas of bad language, sex, nudity, drug use, and most importantly - violence. The film is very bloody and the predictable story line is perfect for this type of movie. Freddy fans and Jason fans alike will be on the edge of their seats ready to see who will come out the winner. If you want to see this film and have not seen any of the Freddy or Jason movies, I would recommend seeing A Nightmare On Elm Street (part one), and Friday The 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, to get a good taste of what both Freddy and Jason are like on their own. This way, you'll have a better time rooting for one or the other. This film will not appeal to all audiences, only people interested in seeing a seriously violent, yet comical horror film.",Freddy vs. Jason
190,jed-estes,A Film To Live By 10,10,21 September 2006,"I waited ten years and two days for this film, it is and was my whole life. On August 13th 1993 Jason Goes To Hell came out and set the stage for Freddy Vs Jason. As an eight year old kid I was mystified and could not wait for this match up. Freddy had scared me all my life, and though I love his character, I could not wait to see Jason give him the beat down of his life, as Jason is my life. Everything I do revolves around Jason Voorhees and the eleven films that are about him. I don't like them just for the blood, I like and love them for their story. Jason is the only slasher left that has not been destroyed by the ravages of stupid executives who want to deter his time line. That is why Jason is still around his plot is simple Kill. But it is the stories that run throughout the saga that make him king, Tommy Jarvis anyone. I hope I never live in a world were their is not a new prospect of a Jason film coming out, but I feel that time is coming as Jason has now gone mainstream and that will eventually kill him, that will be a sad day. Freddy Vs Jason is a solid movie that should have had Kane Hodder in it. But I will not weigh in on that. I will also not weigh in on who I thought won as that only leads to controversy, just know that I know who really won. See this movie as it is probably the last great thing that will ever come from Jason or Freddy.",Freddy vs. Jason
191,HaddonfieldJason,Great Movie!,10,17 August 2003,"Freddy is back,but he cant kill so he hires the crystal lake killer Jason Voorhees. To strike terror back into the teens. The partnership doesn't go too well. So they get into a battle of the century. I loved this film. Ken Kirzinger is perfect as Jason,a great replacement for Kane. Freddy is great as all ways. Played wonderfully again by Robert Englund. The battle was great,and the references to the other episodes of the series were better.

194,80sHorror,This film is a must have classic !!!,10,5 May 2012,"This film was a long time coming and when Friday The 13th & A Nightmare On Elm Street Fans joined forces for this what can only be explained as an amazing combination of horrific, thrilling and well written & acted film.Robert England (Freddy Kruger) + Kane Hodder (Jason Voorhees) going head to head for the thrill of the kill, it can only mean a bloody battle will ensue. Mixed in this film is lots of dark comedy lines. This movie is better than all of the Freddy and Jason movies put together. Freddy and Jason in the same movie makes this a classic for years to come. In this movie, Freddy needs people to fear so he can haunt them in their dreams. Freddy uses Jason to kill people to bring fear in them until Freddy gets stronger. But something goes wrong with the plan. When Freddy gets strong, Jason keeps on killing people. So now Freddy and Jason start fighting until one of them dies. Whoever wins kills everybody. I didn't think this movie was going to be this good because the last Jason movie, Jason X, was stupid and wasn't scary.

In the midst of the battle is a small group of teens who get involved.I must say that when I heard about the movie through the trailers, I was not excited in the least bit. I actually didn't even bother to see the movie in theaters because I knew it was going to suck. So after a large amount of procrastination, I saw it for the first time and realized that was absolutely right. The movie was funnier than anything else which could have easily been predicted. The murders were very interesting though. I did see some new things that make me feel like I didn't just waste my hour and a half.

199,Derek237,Mindless fun,8,26 August 2003,"I have some mixed feelings about Freddy Vs. Jason. It was a lot better than a lot of the Friday the 13ths (especially the amazingly bad Jason X), but it wasn't that great compared to some of the Nightmare films. Overall, it was enjoyable.It has nothing new to offer except the fact that Freddy and Jason face off. It has all the horror movie clichés but never once uses them creatively. When a girl gets naked she might as well be saying ""look, I'm naked!"", when someone is doing drugs they might as well being saying ""look, I'm doing drugs!"" and when someone dies they might as well be saying ""look, I'm dead!"" The gore is good, though. Probably the best gore out of both series. Blood literally flies at the screen. It gets really gory once Freddy and Jason fight at the end. Now there's the acting. Horror movie actors have been getting worse and worse. Whatever happened to subtlety? Monica Keena, who plays Lori is so profoundly horrible in this that it made me not like the movie as much. She is so whiny through the entire movie, no wonder Freddy kept calling her ""bitch"" over and over. Even Robert Englund is at his worst as Freddy. With the exception of New Nightmare, each time Robert Englund plays Freddy he gets cheesier and cheesier. Of course this movie's ridiculous plot doesn't help either. Then there's Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child fame. I thought she was going to be horrible, like every other music star that decides to do a horror flick, but surprisingly she wasn't that bad. Maybe even the best actress in the whole movie. She just played it real, and she really has a great scene at the end where she is making fun of Freddy.Another thing that bugged me where the special effects. In all the other movies there where good physical effects, make-up effects, and camera trickery. Freddy Vs. Jason is just plain lazy. The only reason to see it is the end battle. I really think Ronny Yu was a bad choice to direct this movie. He's mastered the gore, in-jokes, and humour of horror movies but when it comes to actual horror, he's clueless.But like Bride Of Chucky (which Yu also directed), this is just an unexplainable guilty pleasure. It was mindless fun. I guess it was fun to turn my brain off for 90 minutes, even though that was hard to do since I actually respected some of the other movies. This movie I have no respect for.All in all, this is exactly what you could expect from a cheesy concept like Freddy and Jason doing battle against each other. Yes, it could have been better but it far more easily could have been a lot worse, so I give them credit for that. Hardcore fans will love it.My rating: 6/10",Freddy vs. Jason
200,cezbanbelubo,Very good,8,26 May 2020,A very good horror movie. Good actors. Best movie with Jason Voorhers ( i don't like friday 13th part 1-10).,Freddy vs. Jason
201,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Freddy vs. Jason,6,27 April 2016,"Freddy vs Jason was the first film I ever saw of either franchise, quite a number of years ago. I remember not really liking it. However, upon concluding my Freddy Kruger marathon with it recently I have to say it really wasn't bad. Not bad at all. Please bear in mind I'm writing this review without having seen a single Friday the 13th film.You'd expect a film with the word 'vs' in the title to be utter tripe, and this film probably shouldn't exist outside fans' wistful daydreaming whilst they chew on the end of their pens during class time. But the thing is it does actually work, if you give it the chance. The story in engaging and the human characters aren't as irritating as in previous Elm Street movies. The way Freddy is brought back feels fresher and more believable than in some of the other movies, and the way Jason Voorhees is webbed into the story doesn't feel contrived, as I initially expected it to. There were some parts where I was a little behind on who was who – I imagine catching up on the Friday the 13th films will obviously help me there. The throwbacks where kept to a minimum and when they did happen they were not at all cringe inducing. The story is pretty interesting for the first hour, in which we learn about the disturbing cover ups on the police and parents' parts in order to keep the children safe. I liked how Freddy used Jason to spread terror throughout Springfield, knowing that the adults would think it was him, and thus giving him more power. But he doesn't stop killing, and as such takes away potential victims from Kruger, which prompts pizza face to attempt to take him out. Like I said, the movie is engaging for the 60 minutes before the two heavyweights even face off and when they do it's great to watch. Some parts were bit dumb. You'd expect the warden at the hospital to deactivate his card after it was stolen, and teens seemed to figure out a lot of stuff on the go simply to keep the movie flowing. I also felt the ending was a bit of a cop out, as the director maybe didn't want to tick off fans of either franchise by making there be a clear and cut winner. Overall though this movie will definitely satisfy fans of the Kruger movies, and acts as a commendable send off to Robert Englund. Of course I can't comment on the Friday movies but I'm sure fans of the series will be happy with Jason's involvement. Best Scene: My favourite would be when Freddy is pulled into the real world and his subsequent showdown with Jason. (Kruger's face as he realises where he is was particularly memorable)",Freddy vs. Jason
202,careybrandon-41144,Only a few things worth watching,5,13 March 2020,"This movie is extremely bad, with the terrible actors and
stupid CGI... but I absolutely love some of the stoner humor, even though it can seem pretty ridiculous, and Freddy Vs Jason is such a great concept that I love every minute of their fight scenes together.",Freddy vs. Jason
203,The-Last-Prydonian,A dumb cash in but still passable enough fun,5,27 March 2016,"Freddy vs Jason is essentially a post modern throwback to the old Universal Horror movie crossovers of yesteryear. You hear the title and automatically Dracula vs The Wolfman might pop in to your head. A clear attempt to cash in on two renowned Horror icons, this however like it's old black and white predecessors doesn't set out to take itself too seriously. I mean really, how could it ever possibly be mistaken to do so? The movie's plot which strangely appears to ignore the events of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare opens with the serial killer having already been consigned to an eternity in hell. Powerless because the kids of Elm Street have ceased believing in him because they aren't aware of his existence, searches through hell to seek out Jason. Locating him he release the mute, hockey masked, machete wielding psycho in to Springwood, the town where the dead child murderer had carried out his brutal and sadistic killings. Because apparently doing so would begin to have people believing and fearing him again and gives him the power he needs to start stalking the dreams of the towns kids once more. However Jason starts becoming all to effective in what he does and Krueger finds his potential number of victims dwindling as a result. So inevitably a one on one showdown is on the cards. If you've seen the previous movies the plot doesn't make entire sense given the context of the events that took place in the last Elm Street outing. Not that it in any way was a good movie by any stretch but the producers seem satisfied that audience members should ignore this fact and just go with it. That having been said there is some merit to the set up which involves teenagers having been effectively quarantined from the rest of the town in a mental institution. This because the towns authorities didn't want them infecting the other's with the mythology surrounding him. It's been alleged that this was to be the original premise behind Freddy's Dead which unfortunately was shelved in exchange for the one they went with. As hokey stories go it's fun and does suck you in to it even if the whole scenario doesn't make complete sense contextually. The performances from the supporting players are typically nothing to shout about and range from adequate to less said the better. However at the end of the day the only reason you're invested in it is to see Robert Englund reprise his role as the legendary Springwood Slasher. And he does so with the same enthusiasm and aplomb you'd come to expect. The other characters are merely there ultimately to either be cattle fodder or the the obligatory ""heroes"" and and aren't really worth caring about. That having been said the guy resembling Jay from Jay and Silent Bob did offer several chuckles and not without merit. Ultimately when it comes to the ultimate showdown it doesn't disappoint although there's some fun to be had in the lead up to it. Director Ronny Yu manages to keep the pace brisk and aesthetically the dream sequences and visual effects are pulled off with some panache. However at times they can be a bit rough around the edges. Yeah, it has it's dumb, ridiculous moments but then that's the whole point. It's meant to be. I mean how can you when you see a twisted Freddy copulating with the corpse of a teenage girl while vertically standing and hitting out with; ""It's not my fault this bitch is dead on her feet."" In short don't expect too much from the movie which is precisely what I did when I first went in to watch it over a decade ago. If you're looking for a supremely dark Horror movie which is treated with more gravitas then this likely won't be for you. However if you're looking for something that you don't have to engage your brain and you can vegetate in front of as I did then it's a passable enough time- waster. It's at least superior to the more recent Jason X and the 2010 Elm Street remake which are barely worth even mentioning.",Freddy vs. Jason

I mean, come on, something this big! This is like those vs monster horror films in the 1930's 40's and 50's, they were all fun to watch!Well this is the modern day version of those films. Excellent idea I say! Even though they are all borrowed ideas from films like A Nightmare on Elm St. part 3 and multiple Friday films such as Jason goes to Hell. But if you look at this film in a kind manner and just go in and have some fun, and don't take it as a serious film, then you will like it.But if your going to critique from a view point of making a film like the Titanic, then I'm sorry to say your in the wrong neighbourhood! This is just a simple monster film mash up and nothing more. It's not really a part of both series, but it is a part of the realm of ""WHAT IF?"" What if two super villain's of our modern time fought? How would it go?Well apparently this is how it went and was written and filmed. I enjoyed it from start to finish and have it in my collection. I will enjoy years to come, just because it's one of those films that make you laugh, have fun and satisfy your questions of ""WHAT IF?"".This is like the old classic Godzilla films, who really cares about the human drama, only the monster historic information, and last battle matters to the fans of the films.

206,dudedazzreviews,Two legendary horror characters in one great showdown!,6,7 October 2010,"So Freddy vs. Jason is the last in the Nightmare collection before the new one is released but is Freddy a match for the Crystal Lake Killer Jason Voorhees? The story isn't very strong at all but it's good the way they tied the Nightmare series and the Friday the 13th series, it was entertaining and fun to watch. The characters were good but you didn't care for the teenagers at all, not because they were poorly written but because you wanted to see Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees battle it out to see who would officially be the King of Horror. The acting was mediocre except for Robert Englund who, yet again, played Freddy brilliantly and really made the character his own. The actors did a good job but the teenagers look like they should have left school, they look a little older however, they did an okay job in playing their characters. The special effects were good and the gore scenes were executed well and the nightmares were great to watch.This is a really enjoyable movie. It's one of those movies that shouldn't be taken too seriously as it's just made for horror fans who have faithfully followed either the Nightmare movies or the Friday the 13th movies and they will love it. I think other people who have never watched the movies might see this as another hack-and-slash movie. The script is a little bit cheesy as Freddy gives out some cheesy-but-funny one-liners before his kills. Overall, I think it's a bit of fun that shouldn't be taken seriously. It's not going to win any awards for anything and it's definitely not up for the best movie ever but it's just a movie to watch where you can switch off your brain for an hour and a half and relax.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Freddy vs. Jason
207,bbbl67,Wonderful comedy...you'll laugh so hard!,6,17 January 2004,"You can't seriously call this a horror movie. Doesn't that require some sort of suspense to qualify? There's plenty of killing and gore, but nothing that really stands out as an original form of killing or gore. Lot of decapitation, stabbing, dismemberings ... ho-hum. The killings start very early and often. They've wisely dispensed with all of that useless setup of suspense, and gotten straight to what the people really want in this movie -- blood splattering. Having to setup a suspenseful storyline would've just slowed the movie down -- and also it would've made the movie unnecessarily scary. Who wants to be scared?

208,GuyCC,The Moment Fans Have Been Waiting For Really Makes The Fans Wait.,7,18 January 2004,"This is the ultimate geek-fest movie: Two '80's horror icons finally going glove to machete with each other.  And the the most part, the results are satisfying, but it takes 2/3 of the film to get there.This is one of those movies that literally make you go ""yadda yadda, plot plot, blah, blah, who cares, let's see the main event!""  The acting's awful in this.  I wasn't expecting great acting, but other than some screaming or freaked-out faces, no one seemed too into what they were saying when the blood wasn't flying.  I didn't really like any of the kids.  I didn't care which ones lived or died.  As far as plot goes, they were expendable.  And what was up with the Jason Mewes clone?  I saw that, and shook my head and wished that they could have come up with something a little more clever than ripping off a Kevin Smith character.  Even the kid's back up stories were bland.  They helped tie in some things, but it was a long ride in getting there.The Freddy/Jason idea, however, was interesting.  A nice little backstory intro for each with plenty of references to each series, and while not exactly subtle, the two get together quickly in the film, and gradually, the bodies start to pile up.But with a name like this, you want more than a slugfest that comes so late in the movie.  Watching two unkillable monsters go at it is strangely satisfying in a macabre sort of way.Not a bad film.  It gives the fans what they want, but I hope that the eventual sequel will sequel will hopefully give the two terror titans more screen and fighting time, a better story for the human characters, or even some actors that can act just a LITTLE bit so that I might actually want to cheer on the human elements of the story.  As it stood, I just wanted Freddy and Jason to get rid of all of them, not entirely to get them to finally battle, but to spare me from the bad acting that was portrayed on screen. Let's see how they manage to outdo this one in the sequel.  More horror icons added to the mix, perhaps?Fun for popcorn outings with friends.",Freddy vs. Jason

215,jake-179,Hot naked chicks are HOT!,5,17 August 2003,"Who would ever have thought that Jason and Freddy could be in the same movie?  Pretty good idea, I think.  This movie was pretty entertaining, regardless of it's ridiculous premise.  I would have PREFERRED to see KANE HODDER as Jason.  He is the best Jason.  I read that this other guy was chosen over Kane because he was closer physically to Freddy...bad decision on the film maker's part.  Bigger is always better.  This movie is kind of silly, and offers the standard stuff expected from the genre, but right off, I will point out that it was not nearly as good as JASON X.  My opinion, JASON X was really the best of all the sequels to either franchise.  Interestingly enough, Jason is portrayed somewhat as a hero in this movie, F vs J.  I especially liked the scene when Jason attacks all the teens at the rave in the corn field while he is blazing in flames. Good imagery.  The girls are pretty hot, although JASON X definitely had HOTTER girls.  But then, the girls in JASON X did not get as gratuitously naked.  The only got somewhat naked.  It was definitely fun to watch these super hot girls getting naked.  Which brings me to a highlight of the movie:The girl that played the DRUNK CHICK was SUPER HOT.  I really liked her, she is just amazingly sexy.  And, fortunately, there is a shower scene with her, and some good nudity.  However, I am not sure who that actress was.  I thought her character's name was ""KIM,"" but there is no KIM in the credits. So I am left wondering who this girl is, which is a bummer because I want to see MORE of her.  Any other movie with her in it, I would love to see. 
The movie ends with a climactic fight scene between Freddy and Jason, as the title implies, and that gets pretty silly.  It is entertaining, but it pretty much decomposes into a bunch of pro wrestling type fighting.  It's pretty funny to see Freddy jumping up and elbowing Jason in the head over and over again.  I am surprised they didn't have them in a ring, jumping off the top rope on to each other.The movie delivers on the gore factor, that's for sure.  A lot of times, when people get slashed open, blood SPRAYS OUT like a fire hose!  These people must have SUPER HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE!  Also, when JASON gets slashed by Freddy, his blood squirts out at high pressure, too.  How a zombie has high blood pressure, I don't know.  But this reminded me of Peter Jackson's style of super gore, like in DEAD ALIVE.I would say this is a good FAMILY movie.  Take your elderly grandparents and small children!  Believe it or not, the people who sat in front of me had a TODDLER with them!  Yes, you read that right, a TODDLER in a stroller! ""Honey, lets take the kids to a complete gore fest!""  The gore in the movie gets pretty intense, with people being shredded right and left on screen, many heads being chopped off, arms being chopped off, a person gets cut COMPLETELY in half, even a nose is chopped off.  Perfect entertainment for small children.  It's right up there with THE LION KING.",Freddy vs. Jason
216,jofitz27,Extremely gory great fun,8,8 May 2005,"'Freddy Vs. Jason' sounds like the sort of dreadful casted straight-to-video movie with nothing to offer but a horrendous script and OTT acting. Well, I can be sure to say that, on the basis of this film, you should never judge a book by its cover. Why? Because when you get past the weak points this film is superbly gory super Friday-night fun.With no real motive but to get the two demons on the screen, Freddy Kruger wants to kill some more harmless kiddies. In order to get back in their dreams, he resurrects Jason Voorhees to do some killing as well.Bodies of harmless teens begin to pile up in increasingly horrific and deliriously inventive ways, including an almighty beast of a bed crusher and just slicing with the tip of Jason's super sharp swords.It would sound bad to any film respecting person, but believe me, it is far from. It is tremendous fun guessing who and how will the victims die next, and the tension even creeps up towards the end to kill the preceding dark vein of gross and downright sadistic humour.In the end though, this is a marvellously gory treat; funny, gross and huge fun, this is not an Oscar winner, but deserves a shout out nevertheless.8 out of 10",Freddy vs. Jason
217,Martinito_08183,The bad definitely outweighs the good here.,3,21 February 2020,"Seeing Freddy and Jason fight is definitely entertaining to watch. The movie gave exactly what was promised and it delivered. It's sad that the viewer has to get through the bad stuff first, so that they can get to those good moments. I'll say that the movie is insane and over the top and it shows, when the fights start.The only positives that i can give are the cinematography (70% of it was very good, but the rest was too OK for me and sometimes they were some blurry slow motion that looked very bad), Robert Englund's performance, sound (i didn't like the blood spraying sound effects. They sounded too goofy), Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees being the only interesting characters and some of the practical effects looked good, but everything else feels out of place or just poorly done, especially the uninspired story that makes only as much sense as you wanted to.The characters are very unlikable and i felt absolutely nothing, when someone dies, which is not a good thing to begin with, but it's also a huge disappointment, since not all of the slasher movies have characters that we've grown to like throughout the whole movie and most of them don't have any moments of shock, when a character gets killed. ""Freddy vs. Jason"" takes example from the bad ones by having characters that are badly written and the writers knew that they can't write any interesting characters or give some character development for all of them (aside from Freddy and Jason, who are already established in the previous movies, so you could say that they don't count), so that's why the put sex and nudity most of the time, so that they can distract you from the bad writing. Most of them are here just to get killed. That's it. From the first glance you can easily tell who the characters are and what role they will play. There was a moment in the beginning of the movie (the introduction of the characters) that reveals who the character Lori is and how her friend tells her to hook up with some guy and immediately i was like ""OK. That's the virgin character"". There was even a scene later in the movie (the surviving group talk about Freddy's plan that are gathered around a round table) where Lori has a dream and the writers had to remind us that she is a virgin.The acting was really bad. Kelly Rowland, who played Kia (Lori's friend) gave the worst performance in the entire movie. No one was convincing at all, while playing their roles and already it has become a tradition for almost all of the slasher movies to have terrible acting. I'll just say this: terrible casting. The dialogue was also very bad, even when the actors deliver the lines - they sounds laughable and cringeworthy and it feels like the writers spend probably 30 minutes writing the screenplay.The music was very bad. You can tell by that aspect the movie was made in the early 2000s, because it does feature some rock music, so that it can be very edgy. It felt out of place, because the previous movies didn't had that type of music at all. The rest of the music was just Friday the 13th / A Nightmare on Elm Street music and everything else was forgettable.The CGI is horrendous and very noticeable. There is a scene where the stoner character Bill Freeburg smokes marijuana and then Freddy shows up like a caterpillar (it may be implied that Bill Freeburg passed out for smoking too much) and minutes later Freddy, while still in the form of a caterpillar jumps to his mouth and possesses him. There are also moments that they use CGI in the Freddy / Jason fight and it looks terrible.As a whole: ""Freddy vs. Jason"" may not be the worst entry in the Friday the 13th / A Nightmare on Elm Street series, but it is one of the weakest. I wished that it could have been more horror than action, but i still somehow find enjoyment, while watching it and when Freddy and Jason are onscreen - it really does get entertaining, but personally i don't recommend it, because of negatives like the story, characters, dialogue, acting, music and the CGI. It's better if you watch the fight sequences between Freddy and Jason on YouTube, because the bad definitely outweighs the good here. I'm giving ""Freddy vs. Jason"" a 3.2/10.",Freddy vs. Jason
218,TEAQUIEMORO,Only One Will Survive,9,3 April 2006,"When I was seeing this I thought the killing and fighting weren't going to be good,boy was I wrong,this movie kicked ass.It was another good film and why shouldn't it be because it was the same director from Bride Of Chucky.He did two awesome films that I loved,he made it non stop action,fighting,and killing people.This was a great comeback on the scariest killers of long generations of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhee in a bloody fighting movie.And the great part is there is going to be another sequel to the movie.This time I think Freddy is going to finish of Jason once and for all.In part one he did some serious damage on Jason so he could finally be finish and good because Freddy is much scarer than Jason.We will put are places to win in round two,Feddy 0 and Jason 1.We will see who is going to finish who on this second battle on the better and scarer killer of all time.",Freddy vs. Jason
219,shannen-l-c,Surprisingly better than expected,6,26 March 2018,"Freddy vs. Jason is a movie that in theory seems an intriguing idea, but one that led me to have the immediate reaction of, ""That's going to be a complete disaster!"" As it turned out, my initial reaction was wrong. Freddy vs. Jason is certainly not going to be winning any awards or make it into many people's lists of favourite horrors, but it delivers exactly what it says on the tin and does it adequately well. It has everything you'd expect from a horror involving Freddy and Jason - gore, knives, teen murder, dark humour and a face off between two of the most infamous murderers in horror history. The story itself feels a lot more Nightmare on Elm Street than Friday the 13th, and Freddy definitely feels like the central focus. It does well at refreshing the audience's memory of Freddy and Jason's back stories which many may have forgotten over the years. It also brings Freddy and Jason together in a way that makes sense, which is something I questioned from the beginning - how were they going to bring Freddy and Jason into the same universe? It's actually handled pretty well with Freddy essentially exploiting Jason's murderous skills in order to gain back his own power and be remembered once again amongst the teens of Elm Street. Though the plot is rather predictable and nothing stand-out from a majority of films in the horror genre, it's entertaining enough and the combination of Jason and Freddy is interesting. Robert Englund as Freddy delivers as always. He fully embodies the character of Freddy and the amazing job he does at playing him is one of the reasons Freddy has always stood out to me as being one of my favourite horror antagonists of all time. Ken Kirzinger as Jason is good and although he's not the original Jason we all know and love, in my opinion, you cannot be bad at playing the part of a mute murderer that's devoid of any character or personality. The cast that plays the group of teens is mediocre. Jason Ritter (Will) and Brendan Fletcher (Mark) stood out to be as being the strongest of the young actors, whilst Kelly Rowland (Kia) stuck out like a sore thumb as being the worst. Monica Keena (Lori), as the main heroine was adequate but at times grating and in comparison to the original heorine of A Nightmare on Elm Street, Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) wasn't as likeable or interesting. Overall, despite the average cast and predictable plot, Freddy vs. Jason is entertaining and enjoyable, and the creation of a movie that includes two of the world's most lethal killers means that it's a must-see for horror fans.",Freddy vs. Jason
220,actionmoviestar,"After years of anticipation, ""Freddy vs. Jason"" lives up to the expectation",9,23 December 2005,"Pictured this. Camp Crystal Lake. Towards the end of a bloody battle the infamous killer Jason Voorhies he is suddenly pulled down to hell by a bunch of demons. It is sunrise. Only thing that is left is his mask. The camera slowly pans down as we see....BAM!! Freddy Krueger's hand pops up and takes Jason masks down to Hell with him.Now, that's some scary stuff. Maybe some of you understood what I just said and some of you didn't. If you didn't understand what I just said, you will see what I'm talking about when you watch a one of the Friday the 13th films ""with a final Friday"" Anyway, due to this surprise and clever ending to what was suppose to be the ""final, final Friday"" it was obvious that New Line Cinema was going to pair these two titans of horror(Freddy and Jason) in their own epic film. After years of speculation and many different drafts of the script, I must say that it was worth the wait...""Freddy vs. Jason"" was a rock 'em, sock 'em good time.For one, the writers stayed true to the Freddy and Jason mythology. I liked how they didn't just make up some mumbo jumbo bullsh*t just to try to fit it into the story. They tied the Freddy and Jason mythology together so well, that the team up was brought together in the most respectable manner, thus doing justice to both of the franchises.When I heard that Ronny Yu was directing this, I thought that he would not do a good job(since he directed the awful ""Bride of Chucky"") but he did a great job directing this long awaited team up. It is obvious that he wanted to make a larger than life movie and it came out well since Freddy and Jason was larger than life stars.As usual, Robert Englund gives a fantastic performance as Freddy and he still shows that while Freddy is an evil, sadistic child killer he is still charismatic in every way.One thing that I didn't like about this movie, is that the director tried to make Jason out to be the good guy when in all entirety, Freddy and Jason are evil to the fullest. This is a medium to major flaw on their part. It's no biggie but I felt that it wasn't the best direction to go.In conclusion, Freddy vs. Jason was worth the wait. I know a lot of people bash this movie but it's a very solid horror film and I would go as far as to say that it's one of the better horror films of the 2000's.",Freddy vs. Jason

I saw this twice in the theatre in 2003 and really enjoyed it. I decide to watch it on DVD the other day for the first time since and I was underwhelmed. It just wasn't that good. I mean compared to the the last 3 Fridays and 3 nightmares this was Oscar worthy but thats not saying much. The absence of Kane Hodder is evident and the new Jason just didn't work for me. Great idea in terms of the plot and it was filmed almost on the same block as Trick or treat here in Vancouver but it just didn't hit the mark for me. The biggest shock about this film is that it made 82 million dollars and there hasn't been a sequel. The two biggest sequel franchises combine there efforts, make a ton of money and no sequel. Perplexing to say the least.",Freddy vs. Jason
222,Phillemos,"""That goalie dude"" vs. the guy with the small ""knife""",6,27 August 2006,"After years of talk, the folks behind the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchises finally got around to matching up their respective killers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger, in a battle royale. For good mindless entertainment, this movie fits the bill. In fact, it seems like the ""Friday the 13th"" movies have gotten better with age (""Jason X,"" ""Jason Take Manhattan""). You can only do so many sequels where Jason gets unearthed by some zipper-head and keeps killing the same Camp Crystal Lake residents over and over again, so more original ideas are appreciated. In this movie, Freddy Krueger hires Jason to go on a murderous rampage because the folks on Elm Street have learned to ignore Krueger. But after a few kills the Elm Streeters still haven't remembered Freddy, so he gets jealous and wants to fight Jason himself. Honestly, I think they tried a little too hard to develop the plot and it slows down the movie at times. But there are your typical funny one-liners. One of the Elm Street kids says, ""That goalie dude was pi**ed about something"", and the chick from Destiny's Child speculates that Freddy's knife-wielding hand is his way of compensating for a lack of size, um, somewhere else. If you keep the right frame of mind, this is a pretty enjoyable movie.",Freddy vs. Jason
223,briandwillis-83825,Entertaining,7,22 October 2020,"This is about as good as a film called Freddy Vs. Jason could possibly be. The title alone promises silly camp and the film delivers while cleverly tying the two franchises together in a fairly smart way. I really didn't know how they were going to pull it off, but the writers make a very solid case. A lot of the teen characters are underwritten or dull, but people came to see Freddy and Jason slashing through an entire town of people and that's what they get. Pretty satisfying ending as well.",Freddy vs. Jason
224,DarthPaul85,"Better than the 13th, insulting to the nightmare..",4,25 February 2004,"To ""prepare"" for this movie, I watched all of the Nightmare on Elm street movies and then all of the Friday the thirteenth movies (for the first time).  If you were to hold a ""Freddy's movies vs. Jason's movies"" contest, Freddy would definitely win.  In any case, this movie had some potential (at least everyone assumes so), and it had some entertaining scenes.  I'm not sorry I saw it.  But while these two are the two biggest horror icons of the past generation, they don't necessarily mix well. Jason was never about psychological horror (he's just a guy with a knife), and Freddy was never a generic 'just out for slaughter' killer (he's much more devious).  While you might think this creates an interesting match up, it also brings up a lot of questions that never get answered:  ""why can't Jason die?""  ""How does Freddy keep coming back from the dead?"" ""Doesn't Jason ever get TIRED of killing people?"" 
These questions are even more infuriating if you follow the normal Freddy/Jason films.Bottom line- it's a good slasher flick.  It's ""fun"" to see jason and freddy come face to face. Still, I feel like it cheapened both franchises to make this movie, which is obviously just there to please fans of both.",Freddy vs. Jason
225,ichabod81,Clash of the Titans.,8,8 March 2004,"Jason has never been as well known as Freddy here in Finland. The Friday movies were released on dvd just a year or two ago here and prior to that, you couldn't find any of them here, unlike the Elm Streets. Of course they were heavily cut, but at least people got to know mr Krueger. I too, have just began to know Vorhees, but he seems a bit dull to me. Freddy at least has a sense of humor. Jason just swings away. Michael Myers is the same, but still I somehow like the dude. Anyway, this movie isn't about him.. it's Freddy vs. Jason. I was pleased with the bloodfest. Even the woody Rowland couldn't bring it down. The movie is not perfect.. Ronny Yu is a good guy, but he fails to make intense dramatic tones in his films. And FvsJ is no exception. By the time any character is killed, we actually don't care much. Then again we're supposed to be rooting for the baddies anyway.. I don't know! It's all very confusing.

Unfortunately within 20 minutes the film regressed into it's stereotypical ""slice and dice"" and became an actual bore. i cannot blame any actor/actress, as production and acting was above average. what was below average was the obvious money spinning attempt at squeezing an extra few bucks from a well known series, this worked with Alien vs Predator but not this sorry sack of crap.

I actually felt like I was watching NOES #1 and F13 #1 for the first time in the theater.  Incredible.  in fact, pretty much every one of the series' moods were displayed here - the good and the bad.I also was very impressed at the even handling of the creatures.  I have never been a real fan of Jason, but I really liked him in this film. Freddy has great one liners, and there some great - and perhaps even brilliant - camera work and special effects.But nothing prepared me for the last 20 minutes!  There was more action - and pure fun - in the final battle than in big budget films like Hulk and Matrix Reloaded combined.  The audience actually clapped when the fight was over!  When was the last time you were in a theater when people clapped at the end of the movie?I can understand why people who didn't appreciate any of the individual franchises dislike this film.

Or, as I like to call it, A Nightmare On Friday The 13th. Starring the King Of Horror, Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, and another Horror Star, Ken Kirzinger, as Jason Voorhees. Also featuring Monica Keena, Katharine Isabelle, Brendan Fletcher, Jason Ritter, Kelly Rowland, Lochlyn Munro, Garry Chalk, and more. So many huge names in this movie. An awesome chapter to watch On Friday The 13th. I will never ever get bored watching it over and over again. I'm dying to see a sequel, but the sad part is, Robert Englund has said that he will not be returning as Freddy. But I doubt that, and still have faith that he will reprise his role. I also really hope Kane Hodder will return as Jason. Robert and Kane face to face, now that's even more epic.

Fans of both series obviously want to see Freddy and Jason, so the first half is a bit of a let down, introducing the stereotypical slasher fodder and trying to develop a coherent plot. The film does pick up some stem, however, particularly as the two icons come face to face in a juxtaposition of their two different worlds and ultimately their own characterisations. The climax between the two is mindlessly gory and entertaining and worth waiting for. A new postmodern marketing ploy by New Line Cinema, this introduces a fresher audience to the legendary 80's killers and it does well to form a part of the contemporary horror canon.6/10",Freddy vs. Jason
230,campblood13,I snuck out on my lunch break to watch this movie,4,15 August 2003,"I took a 2 hour lunch just to see this opening day.  The good things in this movie are also the bad things.  There is plenty of humor to go around thanks to our slasher heroes, but the downplay on the seriousness leads to not caring about the characters.  Most people will say that the film is all about Freddy and Jason, but to actually be scared you have to have feelings for the victims.  I am a big fan of the first Friday's and I want Jason to be scary again, but I guess he never will be.I am not a big Freddy fan, but Robert Englund ups his acting in this, and of course Freddy has the biggest role because he actually talks.  The teenagers were just boring retreads from this era of crappy horror films.  You have a nerd, a mexican Jack Black wannabe, and a stoner.  This film did have a good amount of nudity and sex, which I was not expecting.  The fight scenes between Freddy and Jason are okay, if you consider Jason swinging and missing good.The ending p***ed me off.  I won't go into detail, let's just say that the producers were telling me that I was a fool to spend money on this film and to actually take it seriously.  I felt like they were laughing at me for actually caring about this franchise.  I don't care, I will still spend money on the next one, hoping that someone will actually care what true fans of Friday the 13th want.

231,ChrisTreborn,""" Great Sequel than a Spin-off """,9,20 December 2004,"Hey I am 22 (in 20-12-04) I like horror movies, those stupid 80's horror movies didn't appealed to me as it looked! Anyway I never take this movie as an extension to one of them. I rather considered it as a new chapter, a new dimension TO that crapped old ones, in this age with new cinematic approach.Freddy Vs. Jason (Spoilers******) One of the most anticipated project the world expecting for years to happen finally hits the silver screen. The ultimate clash of LEGENDS Freddy and Jason happened and turns to be the one of the most memorable Friday 13th movie as well as Nightmare movies of all times. It's a Historical epic cross-over for any Horror Loving movie fans.For those People who came late, Jason Voorhees is character created by writers Victor Miller, Sean S. Cunningham and Ron Kurz. Due to high graphical body counts and adult content he became a horror/slasher icon for the 80's and was owned by 'Paramount pictures'. Director Wes Craven seeing how big was those Friday 13th movies going and wanted to push that slasher trend with his new character named Freddy Krueger. But Paramount rejected his idea but he tried his luck on 'New Line pictures'. They released ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and his character Freddy became a smash hit on the box-office creating another generic of horror. From then the hard core horror fans was fascinating a movie having both legends together and in August 15, 2003, the wait ended.The movie starts with the disturbed Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a child murderer who was burned alive by the parents of Elm Street a place in Springwood, Ohio. Even tough after his death his spirits resurrected into the dreams and nightmares of the children of those very parents who dared to destroy him. Years passed now everyone from Elm Street has managed to forget about him. But he wants his revenge and for that they have to remember him or more even somebody makes them to remember him. And the only person Freddy setup for his Plan was Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger). Jason awakens from his grave and heads to Springwood, for his duty.But things went wrong when Jason takes up the map more seriously. Freddy now fears Jason, he thinks he might loose his targeted victims because of that unstoppable killer. And for that reason Freddy turns his steel claw against Hockey masked killer and the Battle Begins.Written by Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, tells the ultimate clash of the life time. Their plot was good and perfect, it incorporates all the elements from its multiple franchises. They had done a nice work for not insulting the fans, as well as the normal viewer. Even though the screenplay lacked grip in certain stages resulting to some boring hours and lagging dialogues, they finally mark their punch on the second half.Credit goes to producer Robert Shaye for green lighting their script and bring a strong director for this movie. Honk Kong director Ronny Yu successfully blended the story between Crystal Lake and Elm Street. He avoided those stupid captivating 'camp blood' situations and nonsense typical camp scenes, with a new cinematic approach and a new narrating tone.The major mile stone in this movie was Jason, I think Kane Hodder defined Jason for the late 80's but now Jason is a lot more human, yet is still an unstoppable monster. Ken Kirzinger done a marvelous work as Jason, he take him to an another level. His Jason conveys fear and despair, at the same time delivers surprise swiftness when it came to killings. Also physically this Jason is Taller and not a FATSO. Robert Englund as old man Freddy always shined. He did a tremendous work to make Jason a lot like antihero/hero through out the movie.And last but not the least, the soul created by Graeme Revell and Brad Kane for this chapter was extreme. The franchise takes a new heightened musical identity with Graeme Revell's scores. My favorite was the deep bass tunes on the final scene. Thanks to producer Robert Shaye for his contribution to the ending scene.All in all it's a great movie a good action/horror movie fan can't miss. I give this movie 9 out of 10.Freddy Vs.

(Robert Englund) stars as Freddy and stunt master (Ken Kirzinger) is Jason Vorhees you may have seen his stunts used in movies such as 13 Ghosts and Paycheck.The story centers around Lori Cambell (Monica Keena) and her battle with her friends to survive Freddy and Jason. It also stars (Kelly Rowland), (Jason Ritter) and (Katharine Isabelle) with appearances from (Brendan Fletcher) and (Lochlyn Munro).For yet another slasher horror flick and the battle between Freddy and Jason you can't ask for a lot more in a teenage horror movie. The acting is predictable and fairly weak, with typical escapism until they are sliced and diced. These sort of films have to have there unnecessary swearing an a in prompt to sex scene.The positives were great action and scenery used and good special effects and makeup make it an enjoyable horror film that has been much awaited.

It took them 10 years to think of the script for this film, well thats really not good enough i'm afraid!The fact that Jason is portrayed as the strong ""Goodie"" and Freddy is the ""Baddie"" is laughable, they are both destructive killers, if anything they should have teamed up to go on a massive slaughter spree!I don't know what it was about this film, whether it be the laughable teenie ""modern slasher movie cast"" or the CGI or just generally the weak storyline........ it just didn't gel for me and it should have been a lot better than what it was, a horror movie to end all horror movies should have been SO MUCH BETTER.It's true what they say, that don't make em like they used to! 5/10",Freddy vs. Jason

I should say that I'm giving this a thumbs down mainly because I'm like a diner who already had a full stomach before sitting down to have more.I just had had more than enough! I followed both franchises all through the eighties when they were released in movie theaters so I could legitimately call myself a fan. I purchased the DVD because I thought this could be enjoyed like all the other installments. I was wrong I found myself annoyed with the contrived situations and the inevitable deaths that where going to occur.By the time it came to the big brawl between Freddy and Jason I found myself thinking how silly this fight was.Who could possibly win this? Now I understand there might be a sequel to this.Where can the greedy producers take this film? Now for the upside, as a stand-a-lone film this was actually not bad.If you are new to the respective franchises then you are probably in for a good ride.I would suggest you arrange to see this with a group of splatter film fans.These films are best enjoyed with an audience.Probably a younger audience because this is new a fresh to them.If you grew up watching these franchises there is nothing here that will surprise you.",Freddy vs. Jason
236,jhigginbotham151,Freddy Vs Jason - A Battle Of The Horror Titans,7,5 May 2014,"Freddy Vs Jason is exactly what you would expect, a face-off between Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. I enjoyed this a lot more than I should have, I knew I would like the confrontation between Freddy and Jason (there was no way they were going to screw that up), but there's actually quite a few things I liked in the film, its not perfect by any means, but with a film called Freddy Vs Jason, who expected perfection.The opening I thought was really well done. Referring back to the previous films in the Elm Street series with Freddy narrating that he was feared by everyone, then everyone forgot him. It gives us a chance to get reintroduced with Freddy and a small scene showing Freddy before his murder, makes sure you find Freddy as creepy as ever.The idea of Freddy resurrecting Jason to instill fear in the teens of Elm Street, in order to regain the power he lost actually makes sense. It brings the two characters together without trying to awkwardly relate the two of them (a rejected idea included Freddy molesting Jason as a child). It also establishes this double threat, awake - Jason kills you, asleep - Freddy kills you, it creates this inescapable, incoming doom for the characters, you know their going to die, but by who.Freddy and Jason also have quite a few fights in the film as well, they don't just meet up at the end and have a 2 minute fight like most films have. The fights take place both in the real world and the dream world, and showcase the strengths and weaknesses of both characters. Freddys weakness is fire because he was burned alive and Jasons is water because he was drowned. This all makes the fights interesting and not just a clear win for Freddy or Jason. The fights are also extremely brutal, they kick the crap out of each other, its brilliant.I like how the film shows Freddy slowly regaining his power with every person Jason kills. It all builds up to a triumphant return to form for Freddy as he slowly toys with a young girl before going in for a vicious kill, a kill which Jason unknowingly steals to which Freddy replies 'She's mine'. This is where Freddy Vs Jason starts and the film starts to get really entertaining from here.The characters are mostly for Jason to chop up (Jason has the highest kill count of the two). Lori is a sweet, innocent enough looking girl but she doesn't have the same presence as somebody like Nancy from the original Nightmare On Elm Street. Her friend Kia is annoyingly annoying but she does have a bitchy quality that makes her more memorable than Lori. The rest of the characters are all pretty forgettable but like the title says, Its Freddy Vs Jason, the characters are nothing but numbers for a high kill count, and thats perfectly fine with me.Overall, Freddy Vs Jason is dumb, fun. Its funny and it knows it, it winks at you showing it knows exactly how over the top its being at its all the better for it. Its a shame they don't make more Vs films like this. Pinhead Vs Michael Myers would have been a great follow-up.",Freddy vs. Jason

Yes, Jason (this time portrayed by Ken Kirzinger and not Kane Hodder. Shame on New Line) comes out on top over the maniac nightmare man Freddy Krueger( the always great Robert Englund). Was I disappointed? Hell yes I was! Did it cost me to hate the movie? No. I guess I was disappointed because New Line Cinema has had there name on every NIGHTMARE movie and only gained the rights to Jason for Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday and Jason X. Was I mad that the folks at New Line had their horror villain lose to the new kid on the block (for them anyway)? You betcha. Still, I'd say give this movie a go. After all, Freddy (his head anyway) winks at the camera at the end and we hear is diabolical laugh.

240,NpMoviez,"It's entertaining, and that's all.",6,23 April 2021,"This movie is a culmination of why I love Nightmare series and why I hate Friday the 13th series. As a Friday the 13th film, it's easily the best movie. As a Nightmare movie, it's good enough. They set the timeline in such a way that we have spent some time after The Final Nightmare and a little after the events of Final Friday. Thank God it doesn't acknowledge Jason X at all. And the biggest positive of the film would be Robert Englund in his (supposedly) final portrayal of Freddy Krueger. We get to see the creepiness of the character in the first few minutes of the montage, which has been absent in every portrayal or characterization of Jason Voorhees so far. Again, the guy is a super strong zombie who kills people. We have had enough character depth for Freddy from the previous movies, and we can easily get behind the character. The concept of the entire film is quite good. The first kill is just awesome. That's my favorite kill in the movie. There are many other kills which are quite awesome. Freddy and Jason squaring off against each other is one heck of a thing. No matter if the fight between Jason and Freddy appeared at an awkward moment, they still are incredibly fun to see. The characters are better than those in most of the Friday movies, and are often well acted. There are some reveals regarding Freddy's ""activities"" in the past, which made sense. But above all, getting to see a version of Freddy I loved for a last time was the biggest impact that this movie had on me. Robert Englund has done his most notable role so good that it's impossible to find a proper substitute.I can understand that Freddy died in Final Nightmare, got banished to hell and nobody remembered him, so that he couldn't get resurrected. Also, the tadpoles powering him uptil that movie stopped doing so. But the way Jason gets resurrected after the events of Final Friday is just a complete ignorance of continuity. Don't get me wrong, the way he gets resurrected is awesome, but it doesn't really make any sense at all. And I appreciate Freddy's plans to start tormenting people, but that sequence is extremely rushed so that they could get to the final fight. There are some elements similar to Nightmare 2, which annoyed me. There are some plot devices used as weakness of Jason, which quite resembles Jason in Manhattan, which is the worst Friday film and one of the worst films in the genre. The plot device is contradictory to every other Friday film. At least they could've done something that was used in a better Friday film. Even though I like Freddy in this movie, there are some moments which are hilariously goofy and resemble the parody of Freddy from Final Nightmare. I ""love"" Final Nightmare, but those ideas are suitable only for stupid movies. Freddy doesn't get any kill, except one. Freddy's kills are more disturbing than Jason's kills. We could've got some horrifying kills from Freddy, but we get just one. Towards the end, there's a confusing direction regarding Jason. Is he the hero? Because he is treated like one which makes zero sense.But, the most disappointing thing - Jason is STILL a big guy in a hockey mask who kills people. That's the main thing that never allowed me to connect with the Friday the 13th films. We don't get anything that makes the character more likable. This movie was my last hope to make me like Jason. And, it failed to make me like Jason. This movie had me interested in Jason, but that's all because of the support it gets from the character of Freddy.If you are a fan of either of the franchises, this will most surely succeed in entertaining you, and just entertain you. It's an awkward villain vs villain movie, which sounds incredibly stupid but is a fun watch. If you are not a fan of the genre, it may just be some usual killings and nothing else.Rating : 6.3/10, Grade : B-",Freddy vs. Jason
241,babyfir77,"A little bit Elm Street, a little bit Crystal Lake, a lot of fun.",10,4 July 2004,"Being a fan of the Friday series but also the kind that gets slightly squeamish at the theaters, I waited until the DVD release of this battle of the heavyweights to judge it. With Ronny Yu directing (I thought his Bride of Chucky was very entertaining), I had high hopes. Well, Yu delivers. Sure the characters are mostly one dimensional, but the storyline pretty much follows both monsters' origins and personalities, and also makes sense.The kids seem to be fearful of Freddy but not enough so Freddy gets some assistance from Jason to get him his victims and to bring life back to Freddy. But it goes awry and eventually the two have a very cool battle, which is worth the price of admission or rental!Scenes of Freddy's dreamworld, the jump-roping girls, Mrs. Vorhees, the woods, are all incorporated into this movie and it is fun to watch how everything is sorted out.The DVD also has plenty of special features on the second disc.",Freddy vs. Jason

An A++.Although i did hate alittle bit how the kids found out what freddy was doing so quickly, but a it's a movie. This flick has the best fight seen I've ever seen this year(terminator 3,comes to second or a tie). The color of the film made it comic book like,which kinda change the way you look at the other films. I mean it even feels like your reading something out of a comic book. I still Think Kane should have come back,but Kin played Jason with a diffent side of him. His killing reactions were way to fast,which made me jump a lot. Kane is still the best Jason,but I would love to see his killing movements more fast. And Robert,will you never could go wrong with Robert. Even the jokes(which ruined the series)made him look good. I mean think of Freddy from part 1 & 7,but with more jokes.And kelly did way better at acting,then Beyonce. And I love the way they ended it with how Jason X and Wes Craven's New Nightmare got strated. Can't wait till this come out on DVD. LOVED IT.",Freddy vs. Jason
243,The_Depressed_Star_Wars_fan,This movie is okay.,5,17 October 2010,"The movie I am reviewing is exactly what you think it is. A cheesy slasher movie with teens getting hacked to death. The only think memorable about this movie is the fact that instead of one slasher villain, you get two. The plot is this. Freddy Kruger is now stuck in limbo. He realizes that the only reason he is is because of the fact that no one is afraid of him any more because the adults of Springwood have managed to cover up the fact that he exists. So he figures out how to resurrect the Machete wielding Pyschopath, Jason Voorhees, and sends him to Springwood to wreak havoc. Freddy figures that if Jason stars murdering people in Springwood, people will think that he did it and the fear will return, but Jason ends up killing more people than need be, and starts becoming a problem to Freddy.The fight scenes between the two slashers are pretty cool to watch, even if they do get kinda goofy at times. So who wins the final fight? Well thats up to the viewer to decide. The acting in this movie is standard for a slasher movie. The two actors playing the slashers do good. But the others are pretty bad. In the end although not a masterpiece this movie is fun to watch so check it out if you want a fun cheesy time.",Freddy vs. Jason

It is so effing entertaining though and a fantastic film to just go brain dead to and enjoy some top tier gruesome kills. This is literally such a fun movie.Not good, but not good to the point that it is great. Watch it if you haven't seen it.",Freddy vs. Jason
245,milescorn,Where was the real Jason?,4,8 September 2006,"I know that some people have a hard time thinking that the best person to play Jason is Kane Hodder, mostly because he has played Jason the most. Of course he did a good job making Jason the mindless hulk that he is, but there were some other good Jason's as well. I think what would have made this movie better would to have one of the other Jason's be here. The guy that they had play Jason in this movie is just too small, he did not fit, everything was not good about him. He did not have the moves or the walk that any of the other actors put into the role. It was more like the guy who tried to be Jason in Part Five. The Jason from part nine went to Hell at the end of the movie, the Jason from Jason X is in the future, so when Freddy pulls Jason from where ever he got him from, he must have got that ambulance driver guy, because that is what he reminded me of. The real movie Jason must still be in hell somewhere.",Freddy vs. Jason
246,maxyg18,Pointless,4,27 March 2006,"I saw this movie two years ago and it's definitely not something that I'd say is a masterpiece. The movie didn't focus much on its storyline, the script was just poor, it tries too hard to be scary and it fails and the whole movie itself was just pointless. Freddy and Jason cannot die for crying out loud! They might as well be fighting till the world ends. However, it does have it's moments like, its fantastically stages fight scenes, death scenes and not to forget this funny moment when a guy starts to light up a bong during a robbery and starts hallucinating.Anyway, I have to admit, it was a pretty fun movie but it's not something that I'd highly recommend or say is worth checking out, unless you're a fan of trashy movies.",Freddy vs. Jason
247,KillerCadugen,"Interesting, But More Of The Same",4,19 July 2004,"The best thing that can be said about this movie (which is not saying a lot) is that Freddy Vs. Jason is better than all of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies (except the original) and all of the Friday The 13th movies (except the original, but especially the horrifically bad Jason X). The concept of the movie was different, but the ""reasoning"" behind it was lame and the gratuitous killings that happen more out of convenience than anything else remotely relating to plot (what there was of it) was simply more of the same. It was hardly scary at all, but the final battle between Freddy and Jason (and the ultimate finish) was pretty cool. Other than that, I gave it a 4.",Freddy vs. Jason

I did have to stand in line for this movie..and that made me think..Did all 17 of these movies(that is all of the NMOES and F13 movies all together) have such an impact on fans that it could literally pack a theater with people..and not only that but have people arguing over who would win? You bet youre ass they did.  These are two horror SAGAS we are talking about here.  Freddy and Jason are considered legenday to horror fans..so to see them together on the screen...who the hell would want to miss that? Nobody, of course...So now lets get on to the movie.  All the kids on Elm Street have forgotten about Freddy..since they have forgotten him he is no longer in there dreams..the people who do remember him have been put in mental institutions and are overdosed on anti biotics that clear your head at night and make you unable to dream.  So Freddy brings himself into the dream of none other then the legend himself Jason.  Freddy acts like Jasons mother and tells him to kill the children of Elm Street.  Jason does so and this brings fear to the survivors which gives them something to dream about therefore letting Freddy into there heads once again.  Freddy starts gaining his power and starts stalking the children in there sleep once again...as he is just about to make his first kill...his victim is killed right in front of him...by...JASON.  This p***es Freddy off..he does not like it when people interfere with his killing sprees and wants to settle this with Jason..so an all out war wages with body parts flying everywhere!  But WHO WINS???  No way in hell am i giving that away..Just go and find out yourself..trust me this is the movie that all of us fans have been looking for.",Freddy vs. Jason

When nightmare fights reality, there'll be massacre.",10,17 August 2003,"Freddy vs. Jason is the ultimate horror story in film history. Fred Krueger and Jason Voorhees were two infamous slashers who went from slashing teens to slashing each other. A battle like that keeps us thinking of who will be the victor. Dreams vs. Reality? Dreams, to me, was going to win because of all the possibilities it can create. Reality, however, is stronger in the mind and the body. I had confidence in Ronny Yu after watching Bride of Chucky. Ronny Yu here has created one of the best Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th sequels. The scariest sound one can hear is the sound of a blade or a gun cocked. As Jason raised his machete in the fire, I saw a mighty infamous killer. As Freddy raised his glove, I saw a dark sense of murder and humor. The sound of the blades were terrifying and exciting at the same time. An instant classic. As Fred continues to haunt dreams and Jason continues to prowl at night, their legend never dies. Freddy vs. Jason is the fight of a lifetime.",Freddy vs. Jason

I saw it literally minutes after I watched the wonderful ""Alien vs Predator"" and - surprise, surprise - liked it very much. That said, it is clear that this is not a movie masterpiece. But it never pretended to be - it is one of these movies called ""guilty pleasure"". The story is fair and simple: Freddy Krueger (the nocturnal sadist from ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""), killed by his daughter in ""Freddy's Dead"" resurrects the monstrous stalker Jason Voorhes (from ""Friday the 13th"") in Springwood. Jason immediately starts killing and the fear of the survivors of his attacks, brings back also Freddy. Naturally, Freddy wants to kill the teens by himself and decides to send Jason back to the dead. And the combat begins. This is probably the goriest movie I have ever seen, but it is obvious that it is fake. The film is made for fun and it is funny, not scary. But I liked it because of the terrific battles between the famous killers.Recommended for fans of both franchises.",Freddy vs. Jason

It didn't leave you hanging but it left you on the edge of your seat though you could predict some of what was gonna happen.  I loved how they brought both villains together to fight the ultimate battle.  This movie was clever to combine the two the way they did. This movie had a lot of blood and gore but it was awesome.

252,FridayElmStreet,Great Premise but a Real Mixed Bag,7,30 August 2021,"I revisited the 2003 film the united my two favorite horror titans. I saw it in theaters when I was 14. I remember liking some of it but ultimately feeling disappointed. Over the years Its a film I had mixed feelings on. So I recently got it on Blu Ray and now re living it all over again. Im so torn on it. It has a lot of thigs I love and a lot I really dont.Positives
+ Robert Englund really gives it his all here. In my opinion its his best performance as Freddy.+ The fights are really cool, entertaining and gruesome.+ The way the adults in the town try to cover up Freddys existence is a very clever idea.+ The opening scene with Freddy explaining his back story is awesome.+ The killings and gore are top notch.+ Excellent metal soundtrackNegatives
Ken Kirzinger as Jason. Hes not awful but hes kinda stiff and more like a hardcore Frankenstein. Most of us Jason fans wanted Kane Hodder back.The kids. A good amount of the Nightmare/Friday films has some likable characters in them. Not here. They are just very expendable and not worth caring about. Marc (Brendan Fletcher) is the only kinda one to care about because he stands up to Freddy.Too much time spent the other characters. I realize they had to put other people than just Freddy and Jason in here but it feels a little overkill here. Plus add the fact that most were not likable.Kia...nuff said.Freddy killing Loris mom subplot does not make a lot of sense. When did Freddy start to kill grown women?Other than flashbacks Freddy only gets one kill.So like I said its very mixed for me but the positives kinda outdo the negatives.Final rating: 7/10.",Freddy vs. Jason

Actually, going into the movie my expectations remained fairly low.  The last two entries into each other's franchises were (well to be nice) below par.  But the minute the New Line Cinema logo came onscreen and Freddy and Jason's music bellowed out.  I just knew we all were in for a fun time.This movie delivers every aspect of the horror genre:  gore, blood, boobs, violence, humor and so much more.  Till this point of the summer movie season had been a real downer, but this flick outright saved it for me.I am generally tough on horror movies, but the bottom line on this one is: 8/10.  Enjoy!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
254,ClarusTheDogCow,Entertaining,9,16 August 2003,"As a true Nightmare On Elm Street (NOES) Fan, I found this movie entertaining and was surprised that it was a more than half-way decent movie produced by Hollywood (the surprise being that American Hollywood hasn't produced a good horror movie in a long time because of over-used CGI effects and lame plots).I was biased and was rooting for Freddy because I prefer the NOES to the Friday the 13th series.  I think that Freddy is more creative with his death routines, which I find this adds charm to his character.  I also liked the surreal dream sequences, which Freddy vs. Jason had.The ending was a little predictable, but was a nice surprise still.  Without spoiling anything, I can easy see American Hollywood producing another horror movie centered around Freddy or Jason, especially if the money comes in on this flick. ""Sad but True"" it seems.Kelly Rowlands' character was very annoying and I was not impressed with her at all. She should stick to her lame music because her character was rude, ignorant, and plus Kellys' acting skills were less than to par.  I think she should have been ""whacked"" first.The rest of the characters were average to slightly above average in their respective acting skills.  Nice surprise from Robert Shaye from New Line Cinema!As a true NOES fan, I give Freddy vs. Jason a 9/10.",Freddy vs. Jason
255,thetheonly,Could've been significantly better,5,10 October 2019,"I think this film made a lot of mistakes and feels like the creators behind it didn't know how to handle 2 of the most famous slasher killers. I feel like almost all of the mistakes come from behind the camera but there are many mistakes arguably ruining what the film could've been. There have been plenty of other reviewers who have provided the synopsis so instead I'll go over what the movie succeeds and fails at. First this film has an amazing opening and the credits, for that time were well done. Next, no spoilers but i really enjoyed the ending and it left it open ended enough for a sequel, which sadly never came. I liked a lot of the kills and the gore was well done, there are a few kills that are lame though and I wish they could've been more creative with these two famous slashers being in the same film. I also feel like the atmosphere is well set up and I enjoyed the dream sequences. Next i want to get into what this film fails at, its hard to avoid spoilers so this is a half warning where i go over not spoilers per se but things you might want to see for yourself. First the tone is really weird and I wasn't the biggest fan. Next i hated how they replaced Kane Hodder with the guy who he killed in the 8th film as the actor aka a WWE star. I also was sad with the lack of kills Freddy had, he felt really weak and underwhelming in this film. I also disliked the CGI in this film outside of the credits since the CGI was bad even for back then. My other complaint is child Jason and how he's scared of water, literally one of the biggest detractors and completely out of character. Finally the actors suck in this one, the worst of the series, except Robert Englund who always does a great job. Overall I'd recommend it if you're a fan of either series or a completionist, just know nothing special here.",Freddy vs. Jason
256,kidwltm,A Decent Event Film,5,15 August 2003,"Basically I'm going to say what most people will say.  If you go in with expectations for a B horror film with blood, breasts, and bad dialogue, then you won't be dissapointed.  Horror movies, for the most part, have been the low denominator in the popcorn film genre.  It's something to see if your bored and have nothing better to do.  Since ""Scream"", 90% of mainstream horror films don't carry themselves to be as serious as they did back in the 80's, and this movie definitely is that.  It knows its target audience, it knows what they want to see, and it delivers in spades.  If you want to know if you'll like the movie, just as yourself if you like the last ""Nightmare"" or ""13th"" movie.  if you did, chances are you'll like this.  Personally, I'm lukewarm on it.  Some slashers films can be real fun, some such.  For me, Freddy Vs. Jason walked a thin between the two.  The basic plot actually isn't too bad, and for the most part the dialogue is tolerable (i.e., bad but not terrible). Expect the typical characters and plot developements, so on and so forth.  It, as always, becomes tiresome, but it's not a severity, at least not this time around.   The carnage was great.  Lots of classic hacks and decapitations, but some more gruesome and cool ones too.  The film, as one would expect, draws a lot of the fun from just seeing the two icons on screen.  I don't think main characters of movie franchises (no matter how low on the echelon) have ever crossed paths before, at least in this medium.  If you're not a fan, you have to admit it's kind of cool to see these two duking it out.it's horror.  Some despise, some love it, I'm usually in between.  This is a summer popcorn/horror film to the fullest, and I thought it was a pretty good time.  It's not amazing, but nobody thought it would be.  At the end of it all, it could have been a whole lot worse.5/10* * / * * * *",Freddy vs. Jason

258,DMP-2,Actually Pretty Good and possibly the best of both series,8,11 January 2007,"I have to admit I kind of liked this movie. It could have been a lot better, but I give Yu a lot of credit for his use humor. Kind of reminiscent of Bride of Chucky which he did previously. The humor was the only thing I really liked. They really made fun of the style of characters portrayed in the previous films. I was especially fond of the jokes thrown at Freddy and Jason's life stories. That's where the movie failed a little, it didn't not follow the old stories so well. Yu did do a nice job of connecting the 2 stories. I think he could have done better. I really think he shouldn't have cast Ken Kirzinger as Jason. I would have liked to have seen Warrington Gillette (Part 2), Richard Brooker (Part 3), Ted White (Part 4), C.J. Graham (Part 6), or Kane Hodder (Parts 7,8,9,10) who really put his stamp on Friday the 13th . I don't buy Ken Kirzinger as Jason Vorhees. Robert Englund does an amazing job, he almost seems like he's having a lot of fun in this film. He's different from his attitudes in the other Nightmare On Elm Street films. I had wondered if the idea for this film was prompted from the finale of Jason Goes To Hell, where you see Freddy's glove come up from the ground and grab Jason's mask. I would have loved to see some actors from the previous parts come back. I wanted to see Corey Feldman, his role in Friday the 13th's 4 and 5 are pivotal to the sequels. Kevin Bacon would have been very funny seeing he played a small part in the first Friday the 13th. Johnny Depp and Charles Fleischer from the first Nightmare on Elm Street. Laurence Fishburne and Patricia Arquette from Dream Warriors (Part 3). Ted Nugent and Michael Ashton from Dream Child (Part 5). Alice Cooper, Roseanne, Tom Arnold, Yaphet Kotto, and Lisa Zane from Freddy's Dead (Part 6). This could have been an epic masterpiece if done right.

Meanwhile, Jason is killing dozens of people left and right. It seems like they didn't give Freddy enough time.Clever plot, though. I have to say that the writers did a good job finding a plot that worked for the film overall. Not to mention that there were several dialog exchanges that I thought were fairly good. (Welcome to my world!) I think that overall, it hit the decent mark, but no more than that, especially due to some cheesy special effects. (Are we really suppose to believe that someone would fly that far through the air after being hit with a sword?

The one I was rooting for was Freddy, I know that he is a nightmare killer but I don't care I had been amazed at how a funny guy could kill people in such brutal ways. But I was thinking at the ending of the film how could such a killer like him win? He doesn't talk, he doesn't eat or sleep and he isn't even alive at all, he even dreams of seeing his mother alive and well for most parts of it anyway. I was amazed that Freddy had claimed only 1 victim in this film and he knew all about him. But Jason had the upper hand he had been getting rid of some of Freddy's would be victims until Jason got to them. But every one in the film that knew Freddy and suspected that he was after all the Elm Street kids and that was how Freddy had encountered Jason killing off the ones he was after. But Freddy is still alive even though his head was chopped off his body in the last minute's of the film, because he had winked at the audience then laughed. But we all know that Jason will never die, not until he gets everyone to remember what happened to his mom years ago. Freddy Rules!!!",Freddy vs. Jason

That being said, this crossover was actually surprising fantastic.Coming in to this movie I had seen the Jason movies, but I had never seen the Freddy movies. I have to say I was probably rooting for Jason because when you look at it he was probably the lesser evil.The thing that worked the best from this movie had to have been the comedy/humor part of it. The gore was where most of the comedy could have been found because it was noticeable that the blood was brighter and more cartoonish than I've ever seen in a horror movie, and I liked that.This is the movie that actually succeeded in making Jason look completely terrifying, his look is just amazing here. I can't say that much about Freddy but he had some clever one liners.Even if it was a little bit dumb, it was fun and pure entertainment. That's all I expect from my movies.",Freddy vs. Jason

263,connorbbalboa,A guilty pleasure. Don't take it all that seriously.,6,23 July 2016,"Watching both the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street series, it is easy to see that the reasons people love them so much is not for their quality, but for the characters of Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger respectively. Even though both series have had their good films (F13: Parts 1-4, Part 6; NOES: Nightmare 1 and 3, New Nightmare) and their bad films (F13: Parts 5 and 8, Jason Goes to Hell, Jason X; NOES: Nightmare 2, 5, and 6), Freddy vs. Jason is like a culmination of both series where both killers face each other off and hack up some annoying teens in the process, even though it is mentioned in the YouTube documentary, ""How New Line Cinema Destroyed the Friday the 13th Franchise,"" that the idea of the film had been in conception since Friday Part 7. Admittedly, the film is certainly not a ""quality"" film, per se, and it is not a horror masterpiece like the original Nightmare on Elm Street, but it would be silly to admit that the film is not a great watch just for the fun of seeing Jason and Freddy fighting each other on screen and doing what they do best. To simply sum up the story, Freddy is trapped in Hell because nobody remembers him, and he calls on Jason to kill the teens on Elm Street. Jason kills too many, and Freddy gets mad, so they fight. Along the way there is a subplot about two young romantics reuniting after an incident with the girl's parents leaves the boy in the hospital, but that is not the main focus. Like a good number of the teen characters in the Friday and sub-par Nightmare films, most of the teens in the movie are expendable, since the actors are pretty poor at times and even act like complete jerks, so you don't feel bothered when they're killed by Freddy and Jason. There are really only a few kids in this movie that are actually likable. Also, the film is occasionally victim to modern horror film tropes like fake jump scares with loud noise, but there are also a few genuine scares, mainly in the nightmare scenes with Freddy. Some things in this film don't match up with previous films in both series; for instance, Freddy is able to control inanimate objects in the real world after Freddy is pulled out of the dream world by one of the teens. People who know the first Nightmare film know that Freddy can't use his powers in the real world. Also, it is said that Jason drowned in Camp Crystal Lake when he was 11, although it is commonly acknowledged that he was only 9 when he drowned. Also, at one point, Freddy kills and possesses a pot-head to tranquilize Jason (Freddy possessing a teen calls back to Nightmare 2). It could make sense that Freddy could make it work, but not when ordinary human beings try the same thing; this is a point in the aforementioned documentary that I agree with. Negative things aside, the film recounts the origins of both Freddy and Jason very well and it is interesting to see that now the town of Springwood knows about Freddy killing teenagers in their dreams and that they have anyone who dreamed about him under quarantine at Westin Hills Hospital (the same hospital that appeared in both Nightmare 3 and 5). Even though both Freddy and Jason are undead monsters who both kill teens, it is obvious in the film that Freddy is the more villainous character and Jason is the more sympathetic one; it would make sense since Freddy was a child murderer before he was burned alive by his victims' parents, and that Jason was a harmless young boy who drowned in the lake while the counselors were having sex. Robert Englund is fantastic as Freddy Kruger as always, and Ken Kirzinger, while not as famous for playing Jason as Kane Hodder, still does o.k. I know about the controversy of not casting Kane, but just because he is the most famous for playing Jason doesn't mean that the other actors that played him weren't good. In fact, one main problem is that Kane played Jason in most of the Friday series' more disliked installments, even though he was one of the few good things in them. Overall, this is just a fun movie that people who love the Friday and Nightmare series should see, if not to see ""quality"" entertainment, then to just have a night of partying seeing two of the best horror villains in action in one film together.",Freddy vs. Jason
264,koalablue_1993,Sweet dreams Jason,6,1 August 2008,"Two of the greatest horror movie villains face off in one movie!... Great premise... I thought the movie was very entertaining, it was worth the money spent. It is obviously no Academy Award winning drama but it is good for what it is: crap. I have always preferred Jason over Freddy, i find Jason scarier. But Freddy's back-story is the best: A psychopathic pedophile child molester who is burned alive by a mob of angry parents and then comes back to ""life"" to haunt children in their nightmares! Outright brilliant and terrifying story Wes Craven created in ""A Nightmare On Elm Sreet"" Watch A Nightmare On Elm Street, one of the greatest slashers ever.Watch this, pure crappy entertainment.",Freddy vs. Jason

I rate it 8.5 on a scale of 1-10 the only reason i knocked it was the LEAVE YOUR MIND AT THE DOOR way the teenagers realized what was going on...it was as if they couldnt come up with a better way for them to realize why jason was there and who brought him so they figured, lets just make them all MINDREADERS and let them figure it out..otherwise its a slashfest till the end...and a beautiful ending...with my favorite on top...BUT be forewarned dont leave right when the screen first goes black for IT's not over till Freddy Winks!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
267,gillman11,Better Than It Should Be,6,15 February 2004,"Considering every other sequel to Elm Street and Friday 13th movie are so formulaic its untrue (honorary exclusions for New Nightmare and Jason X) I had zero hope for this fanboy's wet dream of an idea. But it works - it really works and has more ideas and more gore than the last ten movies in both series combined. Of course its stupid - thats the point. If you're in the mood for an over the top horror fantasy with good looking chicks, horror buff references, cool FX and more arterial blood spray than you can shake a stick at then prepare to be entertained (but nothing more). PS it was nice that the writers and Ronny made the point about what an evil, sick f*** Freddy actually is - the guy got his jollies killing little girls for yucks for Gods sake! - to play down the disturbing anti hero angle that plagued the sequels. Horror fan? Watch it - you'll be pleasantly surprised, at the very least you get to see the skinny bird with the big mouth from Destiny's Child get offed (sweet revenge after having to hear that stupid record she made with Nelly a million and one times).",Freddy vs. Jason
268,jwtrox08706,better than i had expected...but i hadn't expected much...,6,25 January 2007,"Despite the fact that in the past movies that have brought together two horror icons into one film for the soul purpose of having them do battle with each other have been notoriously crappy, Freddy vs. Jason is different. First of all, Ronnie Yu, who directed a pretty decent sequel in the Chucky franchise, Bride of Chucky (1998), did it again with this film. I wasn't expecting it to be overly scary or horrifying. I was expecting lots of blood, gore, and bizarre and somewhat funny Freddy gags, if you have a sick sense of humor like I do. Now, the idea of having Monica Keena play a virgin is WAY too far fetched for me. There is VERY little chance that someone looking the way she does would still be virtuous. Nonetheless she did a good job at playing the character, even though her looks weren't quite helping her. Jason Ritter did very well. I'm sure his dad, who was in Bride of Chucky, would've been proud to see his son doing pretty well. Brendan Fletcher did a good job with his performance. The dream sequence he has just before he dies is where he pulls out all the stops. ""SOMEBODY WAKE ME UP! PLEASE!!!"" Kyle Labine played one of my favorite characters. Freeburg. Could his name sound any more like ""Freebird."" Pretty funny character. Too bad he had to bite it. And, of course, who could forget Robert Englund, always happy to reprise the role of Freddy, and he hasn't lost his touch. ""Aw...tilt."" That part gets me every time. The plot is decent enough that with the added gore, creative kills, explosions, gags, and other features the movie can certainly hold its own. The one problem with the film was the excess blood. There had to have been gallons and gallons of stage blood used for this film. I'll bet a quarter of the budget went towards it because there was so much. But it's a Jason film and a Freddy film so there has to be twice the gore to account for the normal amount of gore that would be in each of those films individually. But anyone who works at a blood bank probably had a hard time watching this movie seeing all of that blood being spilled out instead of donated. Overall, good fun film for fans of both franchises.",Freddy vs. Jason
269,ethansales,Horrific in the wrong way/10,2,1 October 2020,The whole film is just below average however one scene in which our black female 'lead' taunts Freddy is beyond terrible and is my least favourite scene in possibly film history.The music used is average although the rock used for Jason felt wrong. The cinematography was bland and the script was very poor leaving just the average direction to do far from salvage the flick even if there were some nice shots along the way.My least favourite of the Freddy series.Never again please :),Freddy vs. Jason
270,adam_uk09,No-where near as good as I had hoped.,4,20 September 2008,"Take two classic horror villains that have dominated our silver screens for decades, put them together with a group of horny teenagers and what do you get? Freddy vs. Jason is a classic misuse of the horror genre, not once did I feel terrified in my seat as both titans of horror made their duet debut.One other reviewer raved on about the film saying how he laughed from the films black comedy, but this is the fundamental flaw with this film, horrors are not supposed to be this funny, perhaps a dash of humour now and then, but I didn't flinch once.The Halloween franchise in my opinion has faired much better than these two simply because it is kept scary, Michael Myers kills someone and a lifelike amount of blood will seep from his victims.Jason kills someone in a not so memorable scene in this movie and the amount of blood is unbelievable.The acting is appalling, Kelly Rowland in particular is dreadful in her role. The story and plot are decent but direly done, some scenes are exceptionally confusing until you actually realise what is going on.Cinematography was excellent however, the shots and camera angles used really made the film stand out from other horrors.If you fancy a laugh at the directors expense, by all means, rent this movie out, a much better idea would be to watch Halloween perhaps one last time.Here's an idea...

272,klesker,Stupid But Fun!,6,19 September 2003,"I have to admit that when i first heard about the concept of the two most famous slasher icons in a head to head battle i couldn't stop laughing. I didn't think that anyone would be stupid enough to acctually consider making this into a film, but, alas, Hollywood being Hollywood they saw it fit to give this film the greenlight.And then there was the wait. And more of a wait. Oh and did i mention we waited? It was obvious that the majority of the public were really not concerned with the fact that this film was swimming in development hell. And then i laughed some more when i found that filming on it had begun.Then the trailer came out.................I am one of these people that are easilly persuaded to go and see a film if the trailer is good. Which is like everyone else i should imagine but i have come to realise that if a trailer is good the film will be s*** (Pirates of the Carrabian being the major exception). But even if i enjoy the trailer i will go and see the film.i was stunned by how good the film looked.The joke of the film industry was shaping up to look as though it might actually work so being the simple film goer that i am i thought i'd give it a try.it took me forever to find a cinema that was showing it (presumably because the cinema's were too ashamed to show it) but i found a very late showing at my locas UCI (11:30pm to be precise). So me and a group of friends decided to see it for a laugh.We all came out wanting to see it again. We all loved it. We were routing for Freddy throughout the movie (We all hate the Friday the 13th series with a firery passion from the very depths of hell itself, especially Jason X).
Whilst waiting for the two icons to meet there is plenty of carnage for anyone who love blood and gore by the bucket load (a noticable favourite of mine was a guy getting snapped in two by a bed). The rave scene in the corn field just has to be seen to be believed.The final half hour is dedicated to these guys taking chunks out of each other (literally, huge gore drenched chunks). If you ever have as much fun seeing two of the most famous faces in horror ripping each other's limbs off then mail me. A smile was on my face the whole way through this movie.Ok so the acting is s*** and the plot is completely and utterly stupid but this is not a movie that you watch for its artistic merits, it was made to be fun and there is nothing wrong with that. This is a movie that isn't trying to be serious and knows it and although it wont tempt non-believers of the horror genre, it will entertain anyone that wants a good night out.4/5",Freddy vs. Jason
273,tangreat-bk,Ambitious slice and dice,5,23 April 2018,"It has it's flaws but I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoyed the hell out of it.Freddy vs Jason as the title suggests pits the two legends of horror against each other. And they do have a showdown. This is not like Batman vs Superman where they chicken out in the end. This one stays lean and mean throughout. Not really the face-off we needed but i'm glad now that we've got it.More than the showdown I am happy to report that the movie's a little different. It shakes up the formula. It's a little more ambitious than your average slasher. At one point my friend (with whom I was watching ) commented ""It's like inception !"". I thought for a minute and agreed. A second rate one but at least they tried.It's also very funny at same time. The dialogues are cheesy, the violence is slapstick and the characters are trying really hard to act. It's pure trash in other words but I loved it. The first 30 mins of the movie are pretty standard slasher stuff. But it really picks up after that.It's probably one of the best movies in the Friday the 13th series and an alright one in the Nightmare series.Never thought I'd be rooting for Jason, ever !",Freddy vs. Jason

275,miguelsanchez69,as predictable as it is entertaining .... must-see for horror buffs,9,29 August 2003,"If you're looking for a movie that will bring you one stop closer to enlightenment or win next year's academy award this is probably not the film for you. If you are however a horror fan, or have ever even wondered over a beer or two with your friends what if freddy took on jason you will love this movie. This film has nods to many previous Nightmare on Elm Street and some Friday the 13th material (though the last films in both series seem to have been dismissed). The first 2/3rds of the film is pretty standard (though well-executed) slasher stuff, with a mildly convoluted plot about Jason being manipulated by Freddy. Jason proceeds to killing victims independently. But, the real fun comes in the third act, which is the payoff. The battle between Freddy and Jason is absolutely off the wall. Maybe this film isn't that original (the title isn't even that original - anyone seen Frankenstein Vs. Wolfman or Godzilla Vs. King Kong anyone?), but this franchise is the original slasher article and not a pale carbon copy like many recent teen slasher flicks or the bastardized halloween sequels. This movie is entertaining, it's crowd-pleasing (even if that makes it predictable and, even if it dismisses some of the previous films), and it sure as hell is the best slasher film to come out in the last decade. Highly Recommended to anyone who doesn't mind a little gore and a must for slasher aficionados.",Freddy vs. Jason
276,RebelXStar,"I had to search the bowels of Hell, but I found someone; someone who'll make 'em remember",2,28 January 2017,"Twelve years after the events of Freddy's Dead and the population of Springwood have all but forgotten serial dream killer Freddy Krueger, rendering him powerless and resulting in many years of sweet, murder-free dreams for the town.Furious at having been forgotten by the very town he once single-handedly terrorised he enlists the help of Jason Voorhees, the hockey-masked serial killer of Camp Crystal Lake, to invoke fear back into Springwood's residents so that he can feed off that fear and reign supreme once again.Jason is summoned to 1428 Elm Street, the original home of Freddy's first and most enduring adversary, Nancy Thompson. Only now it is inhabited by pouty lipped Lori Campbell and her father. When her father is away one night her friends come over for drinks and teenage shenanigans.After Jason murders the boyfriend of one of Lori's friends, the police - who have tried to ensure that the current teenage population of Springwood know nothing about Freddy Krueger and his brutal crimes - inadvertently plant the seed in Lori's head, and soon she is freaking out and having nightmares.Though fear continues to spread as the body count mounts up, it takes a while before Freddy is strong enough to kill again and is reliant on Jason to hack through more victims to ensure the fear grows.However, just as Freddy is about to kill his first victim in over a decade, Jason swoops in and takes the glory away from him and Freddy realises that Jason isn't his minion but a serious threat to his title of Springwood's most notorious serial killer and the two must go head-to-head in battle for the ultimate victory.Though there are a few cool moments in the movie, such as making the town of Springwood and Camp Crystal Lake part of the same universe, the appearance of Westin Hills, the psychiatric hospital from 'Dream Warriors', as well as nods to other horror movies - 'Lori' a nod towards the character of Laurie Strode in 'Halloween' and 'Campbell' a possible nod towards Neve Campbell who played Sidney Prescott in 'Scream', and the character of Gibb being almost entirely based on PJ Soles' character from 'Carrie' - I mostly find FvJ uninspired, boring, clichéd and not nearly as epic as it could have and should have been.",Freddy vs. Jason
277,slimjack,A good attempt at splat-shtick,8,18 August 2003,"You have to be a `special' sort of person to enjoy Freddy Vs. Jason.  Take this test: Did you take popcorn to driver's ed. class when they showed Death On The Highway?  Did you giggle uncontrollably while dissecting frogs in Bio 101? Do you have an autographed picture of Richard Speck?  Have you ever been featured on American Justice? If you answered yes to any of the above, then man, this movie's for you.In the grand tradition of Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, Freddy Vs. Jason pits the popular maniacs from the Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th series against each other. Fred Krueger is kicking around Hell unable to invade the dreams of teens.  The children of Elm Street have forgotten to be afraid of him. No fear. No power. Spying the undead Jason Voorhees hanging out in another ring of Hell, the wily Krueger sets him free and points him towards Elm Street so as to strike the fear of Freddy into its denizens. Of course Jason has his own needs and veers away from Krueger's plans. Naturally Krueger gets miffed and so we are treated to a knockdown, drag out brawl between the titular baddies. This fight is the complete reason for this film and a fine, frolicsome dust-up it is too. Both monsters get their licks in, each having moments where they have the upper hand. Surprisingly at the end there is a clear winner. While I can't tell you who the winner is I can tell you that Krueger is the more impressive of the two monsters, not that there is much of a competition.  Krueger, with his dream powers, metal claws and constant wisecracks easily eclipse poor mute Jason and his rusty machete. Krueger is, as always, played by the indispensable Robert Englund with his usual wicked wit and nasty panache.  Jason is, as always, played by a stuntman trying to emote through a hocky mask.
The teenage victims and their subplots are pretty much an afterthought. In the tradition of the Nightmare movies there is some effort to give the victims a semblance of a personality but this impulse disappears quickly. Most of the younger cast's acting is only as good as it has to be and no better. Not that this all makes much difference. Trust me, no one is coming to this movie to see if Kia gets a nose job or Gibb quits drinking before she is fricasseed.Just as you don't approach Freddy Vs. Jason expecting a deep exploration of teenage angst, you probably shouldn't go expecting a real horror movie either. The film is an example of a curious sub-genre called `splat-shtick'. That is, a comedy that uses flying viscera in the same spirit that Laurel and Hardy used cream pies. As such, it is a pretty funny movie - providing you can get into the spirit of things. While it never reaches the sublime dementia of the possessed hand sequence in The Evil Dead Pt. 2 or the classic `head' scene in The Re-Animator, Freddy Vs. Jason does sustain its humor better than most of the `strait' comedies released this season. While I can't - in good conscious - recommend this movie, if you bring to it a sick enough sense of humor you should have a reasonably good time.",Freddy vs. Jason
278,jklein8787,Made for fans only!,10,19 August 2003,"Freddy vs. Jason is outstanding! But let's say this is for horror fans only! Anyone not familiar with the two series, those who don't like slasher films, those who are wimps, stay away! The rest of you enjoy because this film is loaded with gore, boobs, great fight scenes, and plenty of Freddy one-liners. Sure, the acting could be better. Sure there are parts of the film where characters sit around discussing what just happened. But what matters is that Jason and Freddy kill so many people in this film before attacking themselves in grisly fashion. When Jason shows up on fire at a rave and attacks all the loser ""cool style"" kids, it is close to Conan the Barbarian in that Jason uses his machete to great advantage. I can go on and on about how great this film was. Go see it for yourself. Hats off to Ronny Yu for making a film for the fans.",Freddy vs. Jason
279,TomConnors,A Nightmare on Friday the 13th,9,22 August 2003,"For over 20 years fans of the slasher series ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" have wondered which of the film villains would likely win in a fight. When New Line (the film company built on the ""Nightmare"" films) bought the rights to Paramount's hockey masked killer, Jason, it was almost inevitable that Freddy and Jason would meet sooner or later, especially after the end of ""Jason Goes To Hell"" when Freddy pulls Jason's mask into hell. Joke or not, it was the best part of the movie and opened a floodgate of requests for a film pitting the two terrors against one another. In the tradition of classics like ""Frankenstein meets the Wolf man"" and ""King Kong Vs Godzilla"", ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" does just what the title promises and gives us the grudge match of the decade, if not the century.The story is fairly simple, not that it would have to be complicated to appeal to the core audience, or even make the fight fun. Freddy Krueger, former child murderer cursed to forever stalk teens in their dreams, has been rendered nearly lifeless and powerless by the lack of fear on his old hunting grounds. It seems in the past years since the last batch of sequels the parents of Springwood have found a way to keep Freddy at bay, by erasing him from the towns history. Freddy gets an idea to resurrect the killing machine Jason from his resting place at Camp Crystal Lake, and by using the disguise of Jason's decapitated mother (the first killer in the ""Friday the 13th"" series) he orders Jason to go to Elm Street and teach the kids there a lesson in terror.The other sub-plot revolves around a group of teens in Springwood, and like most of these films they have a very thin and forgettable story line. In fact in this film it seems that they have made a mesh of all the horror sub-plots for the last few years, even as far as to have the ""Murdered mother, father suspect"" line from ""Scream"". Not that you really care or notice much, because your here to see Freddy and Jason get it on, the sub-plot is just essential to get us from point A to B, and it does, and when we get there the end makes up for any mistakes or silly dialogue/plot points in the first part. The film really starts to pick up when Freddy finds out that Jason is more than a stupid mutt to do his bidding, when Jason starts to take out every teen in his path, Freddy gets angry. Jason discovers he is being tricked, and DING DING DING, here we go. For true fans I will say no more, it is pretty obvious that you will love this film no matter what anyone says. At the same time ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" is a film that the average film watcher can enjoy, there is enough back story for anyone who is totally oblivious to these two, and the teen stars such as Jason Ritter (yes, that is John Ritter's son) are good looking enough for the young adults to enjoy. The only real beef I have with this film other than the sub-plot fit to mold these types of films, is the obvious dismissal of Kane Hodder, for a different stunt man for the role of Jason. Most non-fans will not notice, and some fans will say ""So what"", but for the reasons I've heard that the actors were changed (they wanted someone the audience can be more sympathetic towards)did not make any bit of difference in the film. There is a scene that does well enough to make it pretty clear that Jason is a villain of circumstance, and Freddy is a true villain. Kane Hodder would have been a better choice in my eyes, because he embraced the character for 4 of the 10 original ""Jason"" films, and did it well, creating some sort of continuity to the last of the ""Friday the 13th"" films, which suffered severely from strange stories that didn't stay to the true plot very well.The film speaks for itself. ""Freddy Vs Jason"" says what the film is, it delivers on all of the promises made, and will go down in history. No critic or non fan will have any say against it that will make any difference, and the opening weekends box-office makes this a surprise hit to everyone. It actually warms my heart to see that I'm not the only one who cares about these film franchises, and I'm glad.",Freddy vs. Jason

I was so excited to see this film, especially after seeing that Ronny Yu was doing it.  I think Ronny Yu made a great Chuck movie but Freddy vs Jason had none of his visual style.

281,Zombie-Kermit,Mindless Horror Doesn't Get Much Better Than This!,7,13 May 2008,"There is no real intelligence to this movie. It's filled with plot holes and goofs. It's not challenging at all. But why would you want it to be? It's a battle between two horror legends. In the red corner, we have Freddy Krueger, the famous child killer. If you don't know who he is don't even bother reading this review. Just swiftly leave the house and rent/buy A Nightmare on Elm Street. In the blue corner, we have Jason Voorhees, the undead, mindless killer. If you don't know him, same deal as before, except rent/buy the Friday the 13th movies. Freddy is played once again by Robert Englund, who of course is still awesome in the role of a sadistic murderer. Is that a compliment? I guess it is. Ken Kirzinger serves as the new Jason, and does a pretty good job of it.Considering it was essentially a mindless horror flick, the actual premise is pretty damn cool. Freddy has lost all his powers because there is nobody left who fears him, and fear is the source of his power. Luckily for him, he has been able to find someone to bring the fear for him. Who else but our buddy Jason? Of course things soon change (I won't mention any more on that subject) and our two killers start their battle, with a bunch of teenagers caught in the middle of it all. All the acting is pretty standard for a horror movies, with the exception of Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger (although he didn't really have to do much). Not really bad, but certainly not great. The human side of the story is actually not that bad. I think it's better than if they were all unaware of what was going on and just getting picked off one by one. They tried to give the people a proper story, and in that sense I think they did pretty well. Sure, some of them got annoying at times, but you get over that. At least some of the teens have characteristics that can set them apart from every other teens in horror movies. Now onto the violence in the movie. Yep, it definitely delivers in this area. Lot's of gratuitous bloodshed. If that's what you want from the movie, then I don't think you will have any problems with it. It doesn't hold back on the gore in the least. Jason doesn't hesitate to use his machete at all. So I'll sum it up by saying it is bloody awesome. But I'm just a simple minded gore hound, so feel free to take me with a grain of salt. There is also a lot of cheesy humour. It's a pretty campy movie. Some people may find the humour in the movie stupid, but I think it's awesome. The special effects and makeup are really cool, and it really brings Freddy to life.The movie is by no means a good one. There are some things that just don't add up with the series as a whole (like the whole Jason and water deal). But I love the movie, and am now a huge horror fan. I think director Ronny Yu did a good job, just like he did with Bride of Chucky, part of another franchise I love. I think that both Freddy and Jason were both done justice, although the character of Jason had a few changes made to him to work with the plot. The changes took away from him a little, but I'm not really bothered by it that much. I really hope they make a sequel to the movie, because I think it would be great.",Freddy vs. Jason
282,callaway76,"Ch ch ch ch... Ah ah ah ah... Kill, kill, kill kill",7,26 August 2003,"I remember watching 'Friday the 13th Part... 9 I think' (does it really matter) and at the end they showed the hockey mask being pulled in to the dirt by Freddy's glove. We all thought it would be cool if they matched these two 80's horror genre killers against eachother. They finally did it.
Plot: Going through an identity crisis, Freddy Krueger coaxes the ever returning Jason Voorhees to help bring Freddy's name back to Elm Street. Then Camp Crystal Lake happens.Haven't seen ALL the movies, but I've seen enough. I've always hated Freddy's one liner hijinks, but at least he's creative in his death sequences. Jason, well he's just raw death, big, silent and deadly. I do find it funny though that in the stretch of time from start to finish(?) these movies have moved the audience from being scared for the victims to routing on the killers. In the theater I saw this in only laughs and cheers were heard, no screaming or grossed out 'Ew!'s. If they do not make any more of these, and let sleeping dogs lie, then this movie is deffinitely the best. We got what we wanted, a match made in hell. We get two royal rumbles, one in Freddy's dream world boiler room and another in Camp Crystal Lake. We get murders by both of the stars and references to the past movies for the fans. With the modern times we live in we get better special effects, better gore and better plastic surgeons (talk about defying gravity). I must say the keg party scene was the best outside the final battle royal. When it comes to the final fight, I was happy with the gathering tension and was very happy with the outcome (well not the final final outcome). Spoiler advice to many, leave before the last minute. When Jason walks out of the water, start leaving. Bottom Line: It's good, a lot better than all of us expected since the succession of these movies has been rapidly declining in worth. You will get exactly what you want. You got Freddy, you got Jason, you got one liners, you got brutal machette deaths. You get drunk, naked, drugged out teens screaming and dying. You got a final match up and you get a winner(Spoiler) ******** Now if they ended it with Jason returning in the dreams of teenagers to kill them, now that would be cool.",Freddy vs. Jason

285,boo_4ever,"""Dude, that goalie was ******* about something""",7,28 March 2005,"I wasn't expecting much from FvJ. I haven't watched that many of the previous Elm St or Friday films but I still expected a entertaining hour and a half's viewing. And thats exactly what I got. No more, no less.The plot starts off suitably ridiculous. Freddy is trapped in hell because the residents of Elm Street have covered up his very existence. All those kids with knowledge of Freddy are locked up in a mental home and drugged to stop them dreaming. As a consequence Freddy has lost his power to instill fear in sexy young teenagers. Now free to do whatever they like without being slashed for the first time in four years (is that all it takes to forget about someone who murdered half the town?) they have taken to pass the time with sex, drugs, sex, skinny dipping in lakes in the middle of the night and more sex. So Freddy devises a plan to release Jason to kill a few people who will mistake to murders for Freddy to raise the fear level a notch or two allowing him to return. Why he has to power to raise other people but not himself is never explained. But Jason starts killing everyone in his path and soon there will be none left for the Fredster. And he isn't happy about it.........You've heard the acting is terrible, the duologue atrocious and the CGI laughable. Its all true. Katherine Isabelle (from Ginger Snaps) is here, she doesn't last very long but she was still a highlight, in a typical stupid teenager in a horror film way. ""My boyfriend has just been killed by a maniac last night who is still on the lose but sure I'll go to a party tonight"". Did she not watch Scream? How the group put together the laughably outlandish (but true of course) theory that Freddy brought back Jason to kill people raised a giggle. A guy who killed people in their dreams brought back an immortal serial killer who drowned to kill people to give him back his power! Of course! And don't even get me started on the fight sequences which looked like they were ripped from a Playstation game. But for all its faults FvJ brought out the 7 year old Saturday morning cartoon fan in me. This isn't a horror film. Its a gift to fans and novelty, not something to be taken seriously. FvJ knows this from the start and plays to it perfectly.",Freddy vs. Jason
286,giatime,Awesome!!,10,17 August 2003,Jason rocks.  I love him so much.  I hate freddy because he kills children. Jason is number 1.  Don't laugh those are my six year olds comments.  he wanted me to post them here. Dont think I'm nuts for taking him to jason but since he was 3 that has been his hero.  Found a hockey mask at a garage sale and has been playing Jason ever since.  Don't worry he hasn't been exposed to the gore or nudity.  I edit all that out for him.  He and I both loved this movie.  one of the best monster to monster fights ever!  This movie was great.  The whole crowd was applauding at the end.  Applauding!  Go see Jason vs Freddy.,Freddy vs. Jason
287,kenvandenbussche-2,Nightmare versus Hockey-mask!,7,31 October 2007,"Around the same time that they brought together the two greatest alien creatures to fight one another in the great action movie ""Alien vs. predator"", they also did the same thing with the two greatest horror icons in this film. Fact is that the first one is definitely better than the latter one in almost every aspect. Still: ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is an enjoyable popcorn-movie with respect to both characters. I would have rather preferred a movie called ""Freddy vs. Michael"" because I firmly believe Jason Vorhees is nothing short of a stupid, pointless and shameful copy of the Halloween-killer. Jason Vorhees took so many characteristics from Michael Myers without adding anything remotely new. They both have white masks, are unable to speak, move slowly whilst swinging a terribly sharp stabbing weapon and have a knack for good-looking and defenceless youngsters. So many obvious similarities yet one huge difference. Michael Myers is the coolest killer ever created whilst Jason Vorhees is simply utterly boring. Like Superman, this Friday the 13th-mass murderer is seemingly indestructible. How boring is that?""Freddy vs. Jason"" contains little or no story, but that's OK. The main focus lies on the originality of each killing and the viciousness and bloody manner in which each teenager potentially becomes a victim. Even so: they had to come up with a way to resurrect these slaughterers and it's done beautifully. The story is that Freddy Krueger brings Jason Vorhees back to life and sends him to Elm Street. There the hockey-masked killer will do what he does best and this leads to a terrifying mayhem amongst the people of that town. The authorities immediately think of Freddy Krueger as the perpetrator of these atrocities and from that moment forth teenagers of the neighborhood remember his name and they get awful and deadly nightmares again as a direct result of their fear for him. Thus Freddy's plan worked to come back to his children.Even though the very ending of this movie is a bit silly; it is the only real flaw this movie has. The rest of the movie is a lot of fun to watch and even a little scary from time to time. Both killers get the same amount of screen time and their duel near the end of the movie is quite entertaining. Robert Englund has played the part of Freddy Krueger numerous of times and naturally he does an outstanding job! Ken Kirzinger was chosen to play the part of Jason Vorhees, because he was so tall and thus looked more menacing than Kane Hodder (the actor who's been playing Jason in many movies before). These two performances are easily the most important ones in this movie. The rest of the cast is good enough, but hardly anything more than that.In short: ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is a good movie where the clash between two iconic horror creatures becomes the main event. The murders are quite elaborate and original. And there's also a good mix of dark humor and entertaining thrills.",Freddy vs. Jason
288,shalabodov-32997,Not to be taken seriously,7,26 February 2018,"Freddy vs Jason is everything you now see in every slasher flick - lots of gore, foul language, drugs, alcohol, and dumb teenagers. But it also gives you the incredible Robert Englund as Freddy for the last time in his career, a not-so-retarded-after-all Jason, and an epic fight between them, which is what everyone watched the movie for. If you're a slasher fan like myself - you'll enjoy this movie, so go watch it!",Freddy vs. Jason
289,crousbrandon,"Good, but Not Sure if I Should Take It Seriously",6,31 October 2019,"I enjoy some of the nightmare on elm street films, Nightmare in elm street dream warriors is definitely the best of the franchise. I don't like the Friday the 13th films at all , I mean Jason X with Jason in space was one of the worst films I have ever seen, and the reboot was nothing to talk about either might even be worse than Jason X. But I gave the film a go. I am not disappointed I did enjoy the movie , and im glad both villains survived , given that kicked the living hell out of each other, no pun intended, bit I'm just not sure whether I should take it seriously, and I hate horror movies that don't take themselves seriously, I guess in the end you shouldn't take it seriously I mean Freddy turns into a pot smoking worm, which is both funny, stupid and extremely silly.The acting is good , although I hated the lead girl and actress she's a bit and annoying , I cared more for the African american character than I did the lead character. Great special effects and once again some funny fighting sequences from Freddy and Jason. I guess this is one of those movies where you just go along for the ride, just to see some kills and watch these 2 beat each other , I can understand that and that doesn't reflect on my opinion of the film. I loved the ending with them fighting, obviously the highlight and the part you actually watch the film for, because like I said I don't really feel anything for the characters, another bunch of teens getting hacked, although I ""liked some of them"" but less than half probably 3 at the most.Any fan of Freddy or Jason will enjoy this outing with them. Robert England gives another fine and final performance as Freddy Krueger before Jacki was cast in the remake.
Overall watchable, just go along for the ride.",Freddy vs. Jason
290,arminio,"Crap, crap, CRAP! :(((",1,4 August 2004,"Oh boy! This movie is TOTAL CRAP!They try to connect two legendary horror icons, put lot of CGI in it, stupid teenagers, girl with obviously fake boobies... and made such a mess where you practically badly want that annoying character die in next scene instead to be afraid for his/her destiny... Not to mention tons of totally nonscary ""boo"" scenes that are simply too lame to be shocking.Story is silly, acting is even worse, stupid dialogs and lines that Freddy speaks (occasionally even in camera toward viewer)... all this looks so ridiculous! Inspite pretty large amount of explicit gore (most CGI :( and occasionally cartoonish like old Samurai and kung-fu movies which is inappropriate for horror), this is not horror in Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street style but more likely in ""teen horror"" style which is degradation of these two horror legends.Sad. :(",Freddy vs. Jason
291,Devil_Boy_80,Ahhh The Match Up I Always Wanted...,8,4 July 2005,"This a great horror film Freddy vs Jason, the match up i wanted to see since i was little. Jason looks his best in this film and Freddy's great to and they both get into a great big fight...though i like Jason more in the film i would have liked to have seen Freddy win anyway here's the plot Freddy Krueger is in hell - literally. It's been nearly ten years since Krueger, one of the scariest horror movie characters of all time, invaded peoples' dreams to exact his deadly form of revenge and murder. But now, his memory has been systematically erased by a town determined to put an end to Freddy once and for all. Potential victims have been drugged to prevent them from dreaming, rendering impotent the master of nightmares. They've eliminated their fear of Freddy, absolute torture for an egomaniac psychopath who's a legend in his own mind. Like an inmate with a life sentence, Freddy's been reduced to plotting a fantastic revenge that will never happen.Until, that is, Freddy resurrects Jason Voorhees, an equally iconic madman. Jason is the perfect means for Freddy to once again instill fear on Elm Street, creating a window of opportunity for him to emerge from his purgatory. Recognizing how easily manipulated Jason is, Freddy tricks Voorhees into journeying to Springwood to start a new reign of terror.But as the bodies begin to pile up on Elm Street and Freddy's fearsome reputation assumes new life, he discovers that Jason isn't willing to cease his murderous ways and step aside so easily. Now, with a terrified town in the middle, the two titans of terror enter into a horrifying showdown of epic proportions, alternating between the world of dreams and the harsh reality of the living world.Who will win and who will lose in this battle to end all battles? A Great match up and a great horror i recommend this to all horror fans.",Freddy vs. Jason
292,peter-bruck,Incoherent campy fun,6,19 April 2013,"This movie has its merits. It's good campy fun, and director Ronny Yu gives us some visuals that are extremely cool to watch at. Any flick that features Jason going up in flames, walking through a corn field, slashing ravers with his machete is fine with me.But seriously, at times Yu manages to make this camp fest look awesome. There's a fight scene close to the end where Jason and Freddy beat the crap out of each other at a construction side by night which is hilarious and almost iconic.The movie knows what it is, never takes itself too seriously, gives fans of the genre a better time than most of the predecessors of both franchises.The plot (Freddy is almost forgotten by people so he sends Jason to Elm Street hoping that people will think that Jason's rampage is Freddy's work so he can nourish on their fear) is ludicrous but as good as the set up allows it to be.Nevertheless, even from a movie like this it's not too much to ask for some coherence within itself and within the franchises. From that point of you, much can be held against it.First of all, Freddy slays teenagers, he doesn't kill adults. (He does so in Part 7: Freddy's New Nightmare, but that movie was meant rather as a satire than a legit part of the mythology). But there's a crucial back story in FvJ that sees Freddy kill the mother of one protagonist – clearly a violation of the Nightmare-myth.When Freddy enters the teenager's dreams, they are asleep. They don't actually walk around doing stuff, they are lying somewhere, sleeping. Funnily enough, at the convenience of the plot, sometimes they're actually doing what they're doing in their dreams, and sometimes – if it's not convenient for the plot - they don't. (Consider the scene where Freeburg is spilling the hypnocil, clearly a dream sequence, but he's actually doing it).So two teenagers had dreams of a man in a hat. Another man with a hockey mask and a machete just went berserk at a rave party. Based on that information, would you be able to conclude that one undead serial killer magically resurrected another undead serial killer in order for the second one to pave the first one's way into the teenager's dreams where he's powerful enough to kill them (which of course is exactly what has happened)? No? Well, the dumbest kids on earth draw that conclusion within minutes.They are also able to act upon facts they can't possibly know. Consider the scene where Lori and Will hurry to Mark's house. How do they know he's having a nightmare in that very moment? By the way, I can only imagine but if Freddy murdered my family, I was committed to a psychiatric institution and broke out one day, I guess I wouldn't have the keys to my family's house which is still there with all the old furniture even though no one has been living there for at least four years.Some fight scenes, as hilarious as they are, don't make sense in a physical way. Sometimes they couldn't decide whether one person was standing up or lying down. The distance between two spots can obviously vary. It takes them a minute to go from A to B, but only seconds to be back. Of course you can blame it all on bad editing, but somehow I don't think that it's that.However, in spite of all these flaws, I've watched the film 20 times and it still entertains. I would love a sequel, but I don't think it's going to happen.",Freddy vs. Jason
293,TreasureHunterGirl,Fun,7,7 May 2019,"I actually really enjoyed this movie. It was just fun to see Freddy and Jason in a movie together.
There were some cool homages paid to both the Friday and Nightmare franchises.
I liked the reason why they were both in the movie and it was cool to see both of their old stomping grounds visited.
If this movie is considered bad for lacking plot and not making sense then I wonder why the people saying that even got far enough to watch it considering you have to watch a whole lot of movies prior to this one which all lack good plots and rational explanations. They're just slasher movies. It's unreasonable to expect anything more than that.
Compared to the rest of the films in both franchises this is one of the better ones. Only the two originals and a couple of the sequels here and there were better or as good.",Freddy vs. Jason
294,mafster,Superb Movie,9,16 August 2003,"Well, what can I say.  What a film!  When I left the cinema I felt satisfied and also grateful to Ronny Yu.  He caught the elements so well for both characters.  The blend of their characteristics merged with the pace and settings for the film.  You even had a cleverly woven history lesson on the characters profiles.  Wonderful.My one downer for the film - agreeing with someone else's previous review - there could have been more gore.  The censors have lifted a little now since the previous films so they could have used a little more imagination and a little more bone-breaking, blood soaking fatalities.But hey, you can't always have what you want.Anyway, it's a must see for cinema.  I might even go again.Very good film.",Freddy vs. Jason

I was going for Jason, he freaked me out when I was a kid. I never wanted to camp again! Back to the movie- the beginning was terrific, a blast off with freddy's history explaining his life. And along came Jason who slashes the counselor with freddy mixing his mind up. So, Freddy wants Jason to kill the kids on Elm Street so that they will remember Freddy. Movie starts off in Elm Street, a small get together with the friends. A couple making love and all you know next is Jason slaughtering a guy! Great beginning. It was hilarious in Kia's not-so-a-death scene. Well I don't have much to say.",Freddy vs. Jason

Any fan of The Elm street or Friday the 13th series is gonna love this. Even someone unfamiliar with either, or have only seen one or the other, will totally enjoy this. It's not mind blowing, not many are in horror, but it is certainly above par for what you'd expect from the genre, or even the franchises. Go out and rent this cool movie, which classic villain will come out on top??? For horror fans it's a must see, and as for the genre jumper, you'll like this one as well.7/10",Freddy vs. Jason
297,Iguanatic,Now this is more like it...,8,8 September 2003,"The long-awaited clash of the horror movie titans has finally arrived but with so much anticipation, could ""Freddy vs Jason"" possibly live up to the top billing? There's been rewrites upon rewrites, recasting upon recasting and rights battles to make the Microsoft v Apple case look like a bus pass application - so was it worth it all? Was it ever!""Freddy vs Jason"" is superb - seamlessly blending the supernatural elements of Elm Street with the sheer brutality of Crystal Lake to create one of the finest horror movies I've seen since ""Scream"". We all know that Freddy's got the brains and Jason's got the brawn... so who's got the killer edge to eventually triumph? I won't tell you here - this is a movie all horror fans should definitely see.The titular battle is NOT the actual focus of the movie, however, but a climatic conclusion to an enthralling and highly entertaining teen slasher movie who's bodycount is probably akin to the entire ""Elm Street"" series before it. Deep in the bowels of hell, Freddy revives Jason and sends him on a killing mission to Elm Street to spread the fear ahead of his own return. Once there, however, Jason won't stop killing and Freddy soon realises he'll have to take him out himself if there's to be any potential victims left for him!The makers of FVJ have certainly done their homework and returned to a winning formula of blood, gore, wicked humour, nice looking girls and a little bit of T&A after some truly dismal sequels in both series. This is easily the best ""Elm Street"" and ""Friday The 13th"" sequel rolled into one - my only very minor complaint being that, as a diehard ""Friday"" fan, this is far more an ""Elm Street"" sequel. But it works very well, so I'm not saying anything :-)All in all, ""Freddy vs Jason"" is the first landmark horror movie of the new millennium. Forget ""Cabin Fever"" and ""House of 1000 Corpses""... there's life in the professionals yet :-)  **** / *****",Freddy vs. Jason
298,horrorflicklover,Blood-splattered slasher flick brutality at it's (almost) finest,8,1 November 2013,"Freddy vs. Jason only stumbles on a couple of platforms. Otherwise, we have an excellent, fast-paced, smoothly executed crossover that should have appeased not only fans of the two classic series, but slasher fans in general.Let me add that of the classic slashers, Jason Voorhees is not among my favorites. I like a few Friday the 13th films. But Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers are on a platform above Jason, if you ask me. Jason was a little too low-rent overall. However, for the sake of such a crossover, I think they put together a perfect pairing.Why did it work? It was FUN. Like the Friday the 13th films, it sacrifices class for brutality. But it does an outstanding job at it. I wasn't getting bored with any lull, I wasn't rolling my eyes in disgust. Freddy vs. Jason really was just about what I expected. It can get away without having any class.So of course, the reason for admission: The fight scene. Outstanding, outlandish brutality. I honestly didn't expect to enjoy the fight scene as much as I did, but it was awesome. They definitely didn't short-change us on Freddy and Jason's showdown.My only complaints are that as a Freddy fan, I wanted a different ending, and a higher body count for the man. However, the latter is focal to the story, and it's made clear that Freddy is generally the more terrorizing one. They still gave him his due in the ending as well. So it's not as if I was outright disappointed.Another big complaint is the dialog. It's as if the writers really thought they were speaking to a bunch of rocks with how Freddy needed to reaffirm the entire premise throughout the movie. Not only was the premise inferred after the opening monologue, better writing would have forgone the need for such point blank ""this is what's going on"" dialog. Clarification is just fine, but they're breaking it down barney-style here. It's as if they didn't have enough faith in their writing to think that the audience would have understood. Better writing would have fixed that. It's pretty lazy, and honestly, how stupid do they need to treat us? Friday the 13th gurus are also disappointed with Kane Hodder not being re-cast as a role that he's played well in four Friday films. For me, that doesn't matter. It's not the same as having a different man playing Freddy. But perhaps this is someone who's not the biggest fan of the Friday series speaking. So I get the discontent that said fans had with that decision.What's the verdict overall? It's not perfect by any means. Flimsy dialog hurting it the most for me. But otherwise, I can't recommend this film highly enough for anyone who wants a solid 97 minutes of action. Whether a fan of either series, or just looking for some simple slasher fun, this move is it.",Freddy vs. Jason
299,stamp1,"IMHO, This Film Should Have Been Rated X, Not R",6,15 September 2003,"I'm writing this review to let parents know, this film is REALLY REALLY Super Gory and it would be irresponsible for parents to allow OR bring their children to this film. There were a couple of parents who brought young children to the theater when I saw it, and the kids were crying and screaming their heads off. They thought the film was real I believe, and acted like they were severely traumatized. The parents  acted like they didn't care at all. To me, watching the parents of the young children was far scarier and more horrifying than the murders in the movie (which we of course, had been expecting). I felt like I was watching child abuse happening right in front of my eyes. Again parents, this film is not for young people, it should have been rated X.Did I like the movie? Yes and no. The fight between Freddy & Jason was Great. A Classic but gory fight. I didn't care for the nude fake breasts so much (it's obvious that all the big breasts in the movie are all fake). The plot wasn't the best. It was hard to sympathize with the teens, because most of them were people I didn't like and couldn't care less about. I didn't find the movie scary at all. The first Alien film was far scarier and suspenseful!! The monster kept growing and changing and you never knew what to expect. In this movie, you knew exactly how Jason would kill everyone (slice them with a machete), and pretty much how Freddy would too (slice them with finger knives). No suspense until Freddy fights Jason. Then which one would win? That was the only suspense. BUT MAN, WAS IT GORY!!!!!! MORE BLOOD MAYBE THAN ANY OTHER FILM, altho Bad Boys 2 was very close in the Gore Dept and the Rivers of Blood dept. This movie was unnecessarily gory, but that was expected. But in my opinion, NO ONE UNDER 16 SHOULD GO SEE THIS MOVIE, AND THEIR PARENTS SHOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO GO!!!!!!!!!!Movie Philosophy: Can Freddy kill Jason, before Jason kills every teen in the movie first?? Can this movie outgore Bad Boys 2? Can this movie spill more blood than any other film made? Can Immortal Dream Killer Freddy defeat Unkillable Immortal Slasher Jason? How many more sequels will there now be?As a victim of severe child abuse growing up, this film brought back some bad memories, but I knew what to expect going in to see it. I had seen the first Nightmare movie (with Johnny Depp) in theaters, and I had seen the first Halloween, and the first Jason, and the first Alien, and the first TX Chainsaw Massacre films, all in the theaters on the big screens, so I am used to these films by now. If you are an adult who likes to see teenagers die gruesome deaths with lots of blood, then you will like this movie. If you are a Vampire, then you SHOULD go see this film! If you are under sixteen, you should not see this gorefest on the big screen. If you are a sweet, innocent, naive human being who likes to see the best in everyone they meet, THEN THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU!!!!

Jason surges ahead, Freddy gets jealous, so they go at each other. The end.""
""Freddy Vs. Jason"" was all hype and build up because the studios knew that in the true horror fans hearts this movie was not going to live up to its hype.  I was so excitied to see ""Jason Vs. Freddy"", & after waiting for almost 10 yrs; I went opening night, what a waste of time and money.  I almost walked out to see ""Open Range"".Or as another critic stated: But ""Freddy vs. Jason"" doesn't have any of the creepy suspense that graced the first ""Friday"" movies, and very little of the Daliesque dream imagery of the early ""Nightmares."" It's just a slam-bang succession of gross-out mutilations, played for giggles"".The worst thing was the mistake in locations when the went from Springfield which is in California to Camp Crystal Lake which I believe in New Jersey. Yeah it only takes 2 hrs to drive across the US!Here's a tip:  Kelly Rowland (of Destiny's Child) stick to music! Your a bad actress in a really bad film!No offense but Roger Corman should have directed ""Freddy Vs. Jason"". He could it have done it at 1/2 the cost and made a better movie.",Freddy vs. Jason
301,Trajanc,A sense of humour and energetic directing save this movie.,3,21 August 2003,"Coming from two series that have produced some of the worst films of all time, it's surprising that this movie doesn't completely suck. The directing and editing are good and infuse the goings on with a level of energy that none of the cast or the script can quite catch up with.

302,tcdarkness,Typical teen slasher horror,3,18 August 2003,"I went to see this in the theater simply because I heard it had some good nudity.  Unfortunately, that comprises approximately two shots and about 8 seconds.  The rest of the film (as if the aforementioned wasn't already) is typical teenie bopper slasher crap.  so much so that you would have sworn that Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven were working together again to make this.  Horrible one-liners (""Welcome to my world, b*tch!""), the token black friend of the main character, the virgin, the loser, the virgin's-ex-who-still-loves-her, the rookie cop trying to help.  It's all there.  There's even a stoner guy who can be nothing more than a complete homage to Jay of Jay and Silent Bob (who just so happened to be in one of the Scream movies).The dialogue, as if it needed to be said, is mostly pointless and when it isn't, simply hammers in something that has already been said or known.With far too little nudity, the film's saving grace is the amount of blood and violence on screen.  When not trying to add in a dramatic plot--which was a complete joke--there were some fine slasher moments when the two main baddies go killing.  Alas, being a teenie slasher film, they turned the rock soundtrack up for these parts.  3/10",Freddy vs. Jason
303,Matrixgirl04K10,A movie for the slasher fans,7,1 April 2005,"*MINOR SPOILER ALERT*FvJ is definitely made for people who love slashers. Pitting the two decidedly heavyweights of the slasher world together, it delivers the gore and keeps the plot visible. Not only that, it asks the classic question that every fan or even hater of slashers wants to know--""Why won't you DIE?!"" What would a slasher be without sexuality? Amazingly, this one manages to lace it into the movie, but not brutally. It doesn't beat us over the head with the sex, even though it does have it.Language, particularly strong. Most unnecessary--but hey, slashers are meant to have lots of things be unnecessary.Blood content--oh yes. That's what they are loved for--intense, copious, somewhat unrealistic amounts of blood spurting out of people. Wonderful--loved it all. Every scene with blood was very much well worth it.Played the slasher rule ""You smoke pot, you are going to die immediately"" very well, as well as the ""You have sex, you are going to die immediately"" rule.Favorite line? Tie.""Oooh!! Tilt."" ""The first time...tends to get a little...messy.""Favorite scene?The battle on Jason's home turf. Freddy's face when he realizes that he doesn't exactly have advantage anymore is marvelously done.Overall, I give it a seven--it's a slasher, so it is, of course, not going to be like ""The Godfather"" or ""The Matrix."" But, as a slasher fan, I must give it a good rating.",Freddy vs. Jason
304,ajbo,Better Than I Expected...,5,1 September 2003,"Wow, just saw the movie last night FINALLY after waiting for what seemed like months, i finally got to see it. And i'd have to say that after first hearing about this project back in 2000 for the first time, and how long it had been in the works, i thought it would NEVER happen. And there i was last night, sitting in the theater with my friends actually watching it. And really all i can say is wow, it was just great.By now everyone knows the plot of the film, Freddy has been forgotten my the Teens on Elm Street, and is no longer powerful, nobody fears him so he can do nothing. So he resurrects Jason, turns into Jason's Mother to Munipulate Jason into going to Elm Street to kill off a few teens, to instill fear into the hearts of them again. Well Jason goes a little to far, and won't stop Killing, so it's up to Freddy to stop him. Let The Bodies Hit The Floor!On the Blood and Gore level, this movie gets an A+. I'm surprised the MPAA didnt hack this thing to death, it's probably because the deaths are imaginative and hard to copy, as opposed to Scream where it could easily be copied. But anyway, on topic. This movie has lots of red stuff, i means lots of it. We get impalings, machete blows, beheadings pretty much anything you can think of, the movie was just full of it. And it never ONCE slowed down to take a break.One the Acting Level however, it wasn't so hot. BUT it's a Horror Movie i wasn't expecting this thing to win awards (Maybe MTV Awards or something) so i'd give the acting a B, thats subtle. Katharine Isabelle, as usual, shown through with flying colors. She's gorgeous and can act, and she does both well. Monica Keena well, i'd never seen her as a leading lady before, but i'd have to say she did better on Dawson's Creek. Not that she wasnt good here, i just dont think she's leading lady material. She wasnt bad though, she was alright, i wouldnt mind seeing her as a leading lady again, just i think it would take time. Kelly Rowland, she amazed me. For her first time acting, i thought she did great. She is definitely a Screamer, and i hope she puts those lungs to use again in another Horror Film, she was just great. Jason Ritter, what can i say, he isnt the best at crying...and sometimes his lines seemed forced, but i think he did well. In parts he would be not so great, but other times he would be fine. He just needs to lay off the crying deal. Other than that he was pretty good. If i knew the other people i would comment on them, but i dont and most of them werent that great (Exceptions being the Mark kid, the stoner and the girl from the beginning who wasnt SO bad) the rest of them were pretty bad.Overall i would give this film a 10/10 i was gonna give it a 9 for having Katharine Isabelle die off so soon, but then there was Kelly Rowland who was alive till the end, and that made up for it. I would have to say this was one of the best movies of the year (Im not into all that Action and Drama stuff, just Horror) and when it comes out on DVD, i'll be in line to buy it. Definitely worth seeing.",Freddy vs. Jason
305,DarkLugia1969,Put Your Money On Freddy!!!,9,28 August 2003,"Note:  These comments may contain spoilers so you have been warned!!!     Freddy versus Jason is a horror movie fan's dream for both the Freddy fans as well as the Jason fans.  The best two horror movie kings go head-to-head to the death to see whose the best.      The storyline goes like this Freddy needs to be ""brought"" back to existence and he needs someone to do this.  Thus Jason is resurrected from the dead and goes on a killing spree.  This helps Freddy out until Jason purposely/inadvertently kills Freddy's prize victims.  So this cause Freddy to bring Jason to his personal nightmarish world and later on to the real world.     The special effects are done masterly as well as the fight scenes.  The storyline very cleverly done and whether or not it will continue to another sequel or to both the next Freddy and Jason films in the upcoming future remains to be seen.  They are even talking about a Freddy versus Michael Myers film.  So put your money on Freddy because you won't go wrong.     The Dark Gengar gives this excellent horror movie from one Gengar to Ten Gengar rating:  A very high nine Gengars!!!  Soundtracks is really good!!!  Enjoy the movies and have a wonderful day one and all.",Freddy vs. Jason
306,austinkunkle,The best fight match ever with a rushed plot,9,16 November 2016,"Freddy vs Jason is without a doubt the best horror movie to have 2 of the best horror characters ever fight each other. Although the movie felt like it was being rushed through a little bit,I still thought the fights they had were just spine tingling awesome. Honest to god,I still can't stop smiling every time i watch them fight. You have a big man carrying a machete and an average sized man with razor fingers, and they're both just battling each other. I was trying to figure out how they would make that work,but then I saw the movie,and the matches and I saw myself. The reason I think the filmmakers were rushing with the plot was so they can get to the fights so soon,because for the fans that love these 2,they don't just want to see Freddy and Jason killing other civilians,they want to see them fight. That's why people wanted to see the movie and that was all we were looking forward to. So I was impressed they made this movie,but disappointed they didn't get to make a squeal.",Freddy vs. Jason
307,baileygiannini,A group of teens try to defend themselves against two serial killers. Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger.,1,21 August 2013,"In my opinion and I'm sure others this film was a complete waste of time. And everyone in the world should know that. It's a rather boring movie than entertaining. It's not scary at all. You know what's gonna happen. Every corner we turn we see no surprises in this pathetic film. I'm really beginning to wonder why no one on the website Simply made scripts is getting their screenplays turned into movies. Some of them are I am sure thousands of times better than this crap Hollywood is making. Usually Hollywood makes great action films, romance films, comedy films, drama films and all of the above. But when it comes to horror they simply can't quit do the final version of the film correct. Everything was bad from the costuming, acting, special effects, the dialog was cheesy and everything else. The only thing that was good was the classic look of Freddy. Overall crap. 1 star.",Freddy vs. Jason
308,derekprice1974,"Definitely for the fans, but a little too MTV. NOT A SPOILER!",8,20 August 2003,"This is the one the die-hards have been waiting on for 10 years.  I felt that the movie was good, but it seemed like it was more of the latest ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie with Jason added in as opposed to a 50/50. Also, although the producers did the best they could with trying to keep it more 80's-style horror, it did seem a little too MTV (too bright, too mainstream).  I'm not going to spoil it by saying who wins, but I was glad who did.  Then again, with the 10-years of build-up of anticipation, it is going to be hard to impress the fans without running the risk of them being ""under""-whelmed.  However, with the very impressive debut of $36.4 million (already turning profit), and in limited release, this could be a very successful movie--hopefully something that studios will take into account. I really wish that studios would produce more high-quality ""horror"" movies instead of just churning out crappy ""another teen-killing movie.""",Freddy vs. Jason
309,HollywoodVixen90,Freddy's Back!!!!!!!,7,26 April 2012,"This movie was good. I remembered watching it for the first time when I was like 14 or 15 not too long after it had come out. I really, really liked it! I recently bought it because I love Freddy, and from what I remembered it was a pretty good movie. I was a little disappointed because unfortunately it just didn't seem as good as I remembered, but I still like it. The movie pretty much speaks for itself, it is Freddy Vs. Jason. The fighting scenes between Freddy and Jason are pretty cool, and there were also a few parts that did make me jump. I HIGHLY recommend this movie if you are a fan of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" or ""Friday The 13th"". You'll love seeing these two fight for the title of the most evil.",Freddy vs. Jason
310,patrick_bateman_90029,I Still Can't Believe It Was Finally Made,8,8 March 2004,"Everyone knows who Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees are. If not, it's time for a quick history lesson.Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) was a child molester/killer who was caught by the cops of Springwood, OH after offing the 20th child. He was freed on the opening trial date because the search warrant wasn't signed, meaning that the evidence against Freddy was inadmissible. The parents and cops, fearing that their children would be next, tracked him down and burned him alive inside the boiler room he took the children to. If only they knew that this would be the mark of death for their children, for Freddy returned in their dreams. Armed with the bladed glove he made and his sick love of pain, he murdered a majority of the child/teenage population, either with the glove or using their worst fears against them.Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger, replacing longtime Jason actor Kane Hodder) was once a deformed, mentally challenged boy who drowned at Crystal Lake when he was 11. His mother (Betsy Palmer in the original, Paula Shaw in FvsJ), filled with rage, went after all the camp counselors and killed them, except for one who decapitated her one Friday the 13th. After that, Jason returned, fully grown, horribly rotted, and armed with a hockey mask to guard his decayed face and various sharp objects (specifically a machete) to slash, butcher, hack, etc. the young, horny, nubile teens that dare step foot onto Crystal Lake.I know what you're thinking: How can you get a dream stalker and a mute butcher onto the silver screen? It's quite easy. Just insert said villain's glove at the end of other said villain's last movie, work on the film's script since 1988's separate Freddy and Jason films (The Dream Master and The New Blood), and find the right set of teens that end up either defeating said villains or learning a new meaning of pain.Freddy vs. Jason is different from most of the Freddy and Jason films. The best example why: Freddy and Jason are in it together. But there is a major difference between the separate film series. Freddy films feature characters with back stories, brains, and some sort of secret fear that Freddy exploits in the dream world (the best example being the infamous 'cockroach death' from The Dream Master) while Jason films feature young, nubile chicks who take off their tops and die a violent, grisly death 5 minutes later.With FvsJ, you get a mixture of the drawn-out characters and the idiot kids that get offed 5 minutes later. Sure, some of the dialogue is corny, but what are you expecting: a Best Original Screenplay nomination for this? The kids in this film are modern versions of the kids from previous films from either series. You have the young girl who has a shattered past (Monica Keena, who could pass as Brittany Murphy's sister), the boyfriend who doesn't know everything that happens (Jason Ritter, son of the late John (who also happened to work on Bride of Chucky with FvsJ director Ronny Yu)), the kinda bitchy girl with a heart of gold (Destiny's Child's Kelly Rowland), the geek (Chris Marquette), the kid who was attacked by Freddy once (Brendan Fletcher), and that chick from Ginger Snaps who lived a bit longer than she should have.It's also different because back in the days of old, a Freddy or Jason movie took only a few months to make and would get released a year or two after the last one. With FvsJ, it took over 15 years to make. The original plan was to make this in '88 (the same year that NOES4 and F13 VII were released), but because Paramount owned the rights to Jason at the time, it was impossible. So, Paramount gave up the rights to the Jason franchise, New Line claimed them quickly, and Jason Goes To Hell was made, which was a sort of early teaser to FvsJ because of the ending.Now, it's time to drop the history lesson and get onto the film itself.I loved it. After too many years of him cracking too many cheesy one-liners, the screenwriters did their homework and gave Freddy the dark, cruel edge he once had. While it was disappointing that Kane Hodder was not asked to return as Jason because he, besides Robert Englund, was the major lobbyist for this film, Ken Kirzinger does a great job as Jason (especially since he had worked as a stunt coordinator on the eighth film, Jason Takes Manhattan). But of course, no one comes to see Freddy or Jason films for excellent acting or a good story. They go to see hot girls who take their tops off, inventive and gruesome deaths, and, which is the main reason for this, to see Freddy and/or Jason in action.But here's the major thing that makes it stand out from the other films: Freddy and Jason don't fight in the other films.The major standout point is the all-out final battle between the two (Well, that and the super-hilarious scene where Kia (Kelly Rowland) tells Freddy off. That got a huge laugh in the theater and a few cheers.). It's not as breathtaking as the battles in Lord of the Rings or as artistic as the battle between Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu in Kill Bill, but man, do these two take a licking and keep on ticking. It's just 11 minutes of a long-awaited battle royale. You see it all: slashings, dismemberments, gouging, etc. The best part is definitely when Freddy uses Jason's own machete against him a few times.This isn't Oscar material (well, maybe MTV Movie Awards material), but it is a great way to spend 100 minutes with those two great slashers you grew up with.",Freddy vs. Jason
311,revmy,Fun but not good,7,3 April 2021,"If you're going into this expecting or wanting it to be of great quality then you're going to be disappointed. However, the insults and way of fighting between Freddy and Jason make it fun. It's not something I would watch when looking for something serious or spooky but it's entertaining and enjoyable.",Freddy vs. Jason
312,SteveDonnachie20022001,The Showdown we all waited for but got mixed feelings when we watched,4,5 December 2013,"I remember hearing about this possible showdown between Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhess in horror magazines. Then I remembered when Freddy briefly appeared at the end of Jason Goes to Hell with his hand ripping through the ground and grabbing Jason's mask and pulling it under. And it had fans excited because we knew it was coming. But what fallowed was years of script problems and planning and very slowly the interest started to die down. Then in 2003 it was finally going to happen. It finally hit theaters and I went and saw it From the beginning I had my doubts this would even be a good movie. I had heard of a unknown director making the movie named Ronny Yu. I had no idea who he was or seen any other film he directed. I was let down that no one from the Nightmare or Friday films was directing it. And add on Kane Hodder wasn't allowed to play Jason because the director needed someone taller to play Jason which I felt was silly considering Hodder is considered to be the best actor to play Jason to this very day. But I still wanted to see the film and went through with it.I will admit the storyline was better then I had hoped. How the teenagers of Springwood are being given a drug to help eliminate the fear and erasing Freddy Krueger from their minds as if he never existed. It was a nice way to explain what happened to Freddy Krueger and how he wasn't around anymore and the whole needing fear to do what he does. So he brings in Jason Voorhess who was in hell since the Final Friday. But Jason soon becomes so out of control that it becomes harder for Freddy to kill when he is at full power so the showdown between them soon comes along.But while this film did have a decent story I couldn't help but feel slightly let down that they didn't bring back past survivors from both Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th films. It would make sense considering the backrounds of Freddy and Jason and it would have been a perfect fit to have someone from both films come back to help out. But we didn't get anyone. And I felt that while the fight scenes were decent and the effects were better then I could have hoped, I was let down that this felt more like a Freddy film then a joint film. I mean we hadn't seen Freddy since the New Nightmare film in 1994. But another thing is Jason was seen more of a victim then a killer in this film. Almost like you felt sorry for Jason instead of fearing him. To me it just didn't do it for me. He didn't come off as someone who was a killer but someone who you feel for and that was just kinda of wrongI will admit the film did slightly better in terms of story and acting was pretty average. But that's really all I can say about this film. I've heard rumors of a sequel but I don't think I would care to see it. This is one movie that should have been a one time deal with no sequels. After all too many sequels can be a bad thing. Why do you think the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th films started out good but went bad over time. But knowing movie companies today with wanting to make money we will get another film.",Freddy vs. Jason
313,gnxfan,The best we've seen in Years,6,22 August 2003,"OK, the first 2 Freddies, Jasons, and Michaels were classics. Scary and thoughtful - had you thinking all night!  The following 40 were low budget garbage put together to make a quick buck (Friday 3d was cool in the movies though).Freddy v. Jason knows exactly what it is.  It's a caricature of itself.  A parody.  But the bucks are there - the film and the sound are A level. Its not a scary flick - its funny.  Freddy throws one liners throughout, most lobbed at Mr. Vorhees.  Don't expect seat gripping and you won't be disappointed.  Go and laugh.  Basically its those 40 flicks all rolled into one finale.  But in this genre you know not to expect a real finale...There are a few wrinkles that they could have done without.  A rape of a drunk coed is thankfully interrupted by Jason (funny how a homicide can be a thankful interruption!) and Senior Krueger lobs the b-word around a bit too much.The memories of Jason's and Freddy's beginnings are neat to see.  Freddy before the burns and Jason before he was a p***ed off goalie.  The ending fight scene is excellent.  If only Jason had squatted once or twice as gas tanks flew at him I would have been comparing it more closely to the Matrix. Yeah, the involvement of the two teens (I like how none of the teens ever has any zits) was not needed but hey - the fight is still better than anything Jackie Chan has ever put out.  Ever. The homage to The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is cute too.I was really disappointed with Jason takes Manhattan.  10 minutes of NYC that was really filmed in Vancouver were not what I was looking forward to. That doesn't happen here.  I got what I expected.  Yeah that is a bit of a downer in itself - but its not tragic.  Sure, I would have loved better dialogue, acting, and maybe a twist here and there - but the premise of Jason on Elm Street is cool.Go see it.  If not - wait for the DVD and crank up the widescreen and the surround sound. I give it a 6.Next winter:  Michael Myers and Freddy tag team Jason.  Coming soon.",Freddy vs. Jason
314,Daelock,When Legends Collide to Beat the Crap Out of Each Other,8,4 February 2004,"In the 80s, two names became synonymous with the genre defining series in the slasher world: Jason Vorhees and Freddy Kreuger. They shredded the box office and preyed on our fears, setting the tone for an entire genre to come. Now, in the tradition of King Kong Vs. Godzilla and Dracula Vs. The Wolfman, Freddy Vs. Jason. I went into this movie with a healthy amount of skepticism, but also a healthy amount of anticipation. I'd never been a big fan of Friday or Nightmare, but my friends and I had just watched the original Nightmare on Elm Street and Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday in preparation, though I later learned that Jason Goes to Hell was not the best prep film since Jason is barely in it. Anyway, we go in and right from the intro, we know it's gonna be pretty sweet. Now Robert Englund has played Freddy Kreuger in every single Nightmare on Elm Street movie and he's still got such an incredible spunk and spirit for the role that he is easily the best actor in the entire film. Though that's not exactly hard in this movie, the acting still gets the job done, not exactly the deepest parts. Of course everyone had already made up their mind on who to root for long before going into the movie(I was pulling for Jason just cause I love the whole silent killer with a mask deal.) and the ending will probably disappoint some, but I've heard they'll be making Freddy Vs Jason Vs Ash(from Evil Dead) so I say BRING ON THE SEQUEL! In any event, the plot's been explained, all I'll say is stick this movie out til the end. The last twenty minutes is basically devoted to how much pain Freddy and Jason can inflict upon each other. It is a visceral, gut wrenching brawl basically due to the lack of CGI in the fight. Because of this, the hits feel like they have some impact and power rather than just drifting through each other. Powerful end fight with some good laughs from Freddy and some stylish killings from Jason(and by stylish I mean graphic and brutal). All in all, a great movie.",Freddy vs. Jason
315,AngryMovieNerd,"An interesting and yet promising premise is ruined by the bad acting, which serves nothing new to the plot. (* * out of * * * *)",5,15 October 2005,"Freddy vs. Jason (2003) has a promising premise: two cult legends duke it out in a fight to the finish. But the problem is not Freddy or Jason, it's the acting. The film is filled with lame characters who take up the screen time with a goofy subplot. It isn't long before they're killed off by the two title characters.Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund) has been long forgotten by the new generation of teenagers living on Elm Street. He wants his name back in the headlines, and in order to do so, he must awaken Jason Vorhees (Ken Kirzinger) and manipulate him to go a rampage on Elm Street, in order to regain his power.Freddy gets mad when Jason steals a few of his chosen victims, which sets-up two all-out battles between the two horror legends: one in Freddy's world of nightmare and the other at Camp Crystal Lake. Meanwhile a group of teens are stuck in the middle of the conflict, trying to rid of Freddy and Jason.The acting from the co-stars is the film's weakest link. The heroes (Monica Keena, Jason ""son of John"" Ritter, Kelly Rowland, and Christopher George Marquette, to name a few) refuse to shut up and add nothing new to the plot, except for a subplot involving sleep-inducing pills. I just didn't seem to care for them. And unbelievably, the actors have more screen presences than that of Jason and Freddy.Director Ronny Yu fills the screen with the usual horror clichés such as big-breasted women (Monica Keena does show a lot of cleavage here), and Freddy vs. Jason delivers a great final battle royale sequence, between Freddy and Jason, which is annoyingly distracted by the presence of the remaining survivors.Freddy vs. Jason was a big hit back in 2003, and probably means that we'll have a rematch in the years to come. I'm not a real big fan of Freddy, nor Jason. I've seen all Jason movies (all horrible) and very few of the Freddy movies. Who wins, I will not reveal, but I will say that Freddy Krueger is sadistic in his killings, while Jason is pretty straightforward.For those who haven't seen the film, it's certain that with its big title, it's likely to lure fans of the horror legends to see the movie. Those expecting the numerous fights between Freddy and Jason to be on a grand scale are likely to be disappointed.Ever since Universal Pictures tried to milk a few more dollars from their struggling '30s monster movies by bringing together the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster, Hollywood has embraced these kind of combination endeavors. And with an interesting concept, I'm hoping to see more horror legends in a battle royale. Michael vs. Jason, anyone? Or how's about a Freddy vs. Jason, part two?",Freddy vs. Jason
316,FlaviusAetius,Best Unintentional Comedy of 2003,3,14 November 2006,"This movie was hyped for months by all the horror junkies. I wasn't really into horror films, so when it came out in theaters in really just blew right over me. I finally saw it one bored night in 2005 on the Sci-fi channel.Let the clash of the titans begin! Freddy is in Hell. Does that come as a surprise? Apparently, everyone's forgotten him, and if they've forgotten him they obviously can't fear him, and if no one's afraid of him, he's pretty much powerless. But he's hatched a devilish scheme to reclaim his former glory: he'll brainwash psychopath-in-arms Jason Voorhees of Friday the 13th fame to head down to his old haunt, Elm Street, and hack up a few teens, just to remind the townspeople that the Springwood Slasher is still around. But wait! Jason quickly proves to be out of Freddy's control! The battle between the two giants begins! All right, a massive plot hole opened up fairly quickly: the success of Freddy's scheme hinges on the townspeople assuming he's back after Jason kills a few people, right? Well, that wouldn't work in reality: it's so obviously a different guy! Jason looks so unlike Freddy and kills in a manner so unlike Freddy, I can't even believe that anyone would for a second assume that Freddy had something to do with it. I mean yes, he did have something to do with it, but they didn't know that! So if anyone is ever murdered in Elm Street afterwards, no matter how unconnected they are with Freddy, he'll be blamed anyway? WTF? It turns out that the parents were taking some pretty serious steps to ensure Freddy never returned: putting their kids in nuthouses, for one. And drugging others into dreamless comas. But I guess the fascist right-winger in me just isn't complaining: it's either the nuthouse or a peaceful coma or it's a horrifying, nightmarish death at the hands of a merciless psychopath. Kind of a lose-lose situation, huh? The teens try to uncover the dark plot and survive both maniacs, all culminating in a showdown at Jason's abode, Camp Crystal Lake. (Which happens to be twenty minutes down the Interstate from Elm Street.) The movie up to this point has been average. Not exactly scary, but a little disturbing. It reminded me that yes, it would suck to live in Elm Street, and the live expectancy definitely went down after Jason was introduced to the area, much like a new predator being introduced into a new ecosystem. Average, not scary but not that bad, either. At this point, the film takes a downward spiral into inanity.The final brawl between the film's namesakes is short, about twenty minutes. Freddy is wrenched out of the dream world after he had been tormenting Jason mentally, and naturally, Jason isn't too happy about that. So let the showdown begin. The fight if utterly hilarious: apparently Freddy's a martial artist! Seriously! He does this weird Taekwondo front snap kick on Jason, followed up by some freaky Muay Thai elbow to his big noggin. And neither are done that well. Meanwhile, Jason's blundering around, clumsily trying to hit the physically-thoroughly-average Freddy, who in turns needles him with harmless claw strikes that just bounce right off his gargantuan form. Not only does this cause the movie itself to implode, it does massive damage to both characters' respective series. They're unstoppable and fearsome when hacking up helpless screaming teens, but when pitted against a equal match, they're both pathetic. They're just bullies, really. Jason can deliver his fatal version of coitus interruptus on naked teens, but could he kill a well-trained samurai? Freddy can kill in your dreams, but in the real world, would he be much of a match for a real martial artist? The skill at fighting both show is about equal to the armies of faceless goons Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Tony Jaa, Steven Seagal, and Chuck Norris annihilated in their multitudes of movies.Then it really gets funny! Jason hits that one Kelly girl or whatever her name is from the Survivors, I think, and get this: instead of simply being cut in half down the middle like countless other victims, she goes flying through the air in a spinning cartwheel for like a hundred yards before hitting a tree! How funny is that? And it's quite obviously a dummy, too. Conveniently, there's construction equipment lying around Camp Crystal Lake. Oxygen tanks, metal rods, carts, pulleys, cranes, a weird roller coaster track, everything. This allows for some comic bumbling of both Freddy and Jason. They fall off heights! They get hit by mine carts! It's like a demonic Three Stooges episode: I was half expecting Jason to start whooping. At that point, I could really tell the slasher horror genre had died when its two veteran alumni were reduced to bumbling fools.On the good side, the beginning and the middle aren't too bad. And I always thought that Robert Englund always excelled as Freddy, and this one's no different. A manic, flamboyant madman with a twisted sense of humor, he's simultaneously funny and frightening. That balance has always made him a memorable character, to say the least.It's good for some hearty laughs, but not for scares. To die-hard fans of Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th: stay away!!!!",Freddy vs. Jason

But if you're looking for more, well, give it some time.Don't expect any decent dialogue or even remotely believable characters. This is not what a Freddy or Jason movie is about, after all. More precisely, the beginning of the movie looks a lot like it's painting by numbers for teen horror flicks. (This does include naked teenage girls, of course.) After a few stereotyped ""characters"" have been introduced and taken through a number of absolutely unbelievable situations (Oh, I just found a bloody, twisted mess that used to be my abusive boy-friend. Maybe I ought to go to a party to shake it off!) Freddy notices, there are things he doesn't exactly like about his henchman Jason. This is, when the movie finally gets going.The final is very tense and very packed with action as Freddy and Jason get their ultimate face off. You will not have any trouble to take sides, though, as Jason comes across as a misunderstood Karloff kind of Frankenstein's monster with a big knife during the end. It is still utterly ill-conceived, badly written and unchallengingly acted. But director Yu knows his action sequences and so there's a brutal but very entertaining joyride ahead. Only that some bad subplots are left hanging in the air and kind of just disappear.Leave it some time and you will get some decent entertainment.

321,uNdAdAiNfLuEnCe,The Perfect Movie.,10,15 August 2003,"I saw it just now and I must say it is one of the best ever movies this year. Freddy was acting like his old school self, being a smart ass to everyone. As for Jason, he was, Jason. Killing whomever got into this path.The kills were sick. Some of them never done before, but don't worry, Jason with his machete was still as brutal as before. Freddy's kills were all unique and done perfectly. I enjoyed all the kills.The acting was the best ever in a slaughter movie. Although at some parts it was a little too dramatic, but that didn't bother me too much. Robert Englund was brilliant in this movie. He was just as scary as before, with one hell of an attitude. Ken Kirzinger perfectly portrayed the original Jason, and dare I say, almost better. They did not disappointed at all.The plot was surprisingly good. It wasn't rushed, and it was explained in a clear way. As the movie progressed, we got to get a better feel for the characters, and even Freddy and Jason. Each characters weaknesses were revealed, and each character used that to there advantage.

322,uNdAdAiNfLuEnCe,Freddy Vs. Jason = Best Horror Film,10,16 August 2003,"I saw Freddy Vs. Jason opening day in the afternoon and I must say it is one of the best ever movies this year. Freddy was acting like his old school self, being a smart aleck to everyone. As for Jason, he was, Jason. Killing whomever got into this path. The kills were sick. Some of them never done before, but don't worry, Jason with his machete was still as brutal as before. Freddy's kills were all unique and done perfectly. I enjoyed all the kills. The acting was the best ever in a slaughter movie. Although at some parts it was a little too dramatic, but that didn't bother me too much. Robert Englund was brilliant in this movie. He was just as scary as before, with one hell of an attitude. Ken Kirzinger perfectly portrayed the original Jason, and dare I say, almost better. They did not disappointed at all. The plot was surprisingly good. It wasn't rushed, and it was explained in a clear way. As the movie progressed, we got to get a better feel for the characters, and even Freddy and Jason. Each characters weaknesses were revealed, and each character used that to there advantage. How I could ahead and say some strategy was used by Freddy and Jason, but then again, only Freddy used Jason to Freddy's advantage. Plus, Jason isn't technically an ""average"" person to use his brains. But he did feel emotion, which really made this movie great.  The music was breathtaking.

323,mlwitvliet,It was good until....,6,14 October 2010,"Yesterday I saw the last movie of the series. Despite myself I have watched all the movies from the series but stick to my view. From the third film off Fred became Freddy. A parody on himself in a fairytale. Then there was ""A new nightmare"" and it brought back Fred.So as I started to watch this movie and liked it. It had the same suspense as NOEM 1 and I liked the storyline. There was also Fred's humor but they did it well this time. There is no reason why a character like Fred doesn't have humor as long as it doesn't kill the suspense.But Alas. The fighting between Jason and Fred began and the movie became instantly lame again. What a disappointment. What could have been a battle between two Horror hero's became lame fighting scenes for the Nintendo-generation again by adding ping pong sounds. Immediately i asked myself: WHY?????? What's the point of making such a movie with suspense and all and throw this all away by putting the ping pong sounds in. You are making a horror movie or you are making a parody. Make up your minds next time.",Freddy vs. Jason
324,osnelgro,better then the rest and very entertaining,8,23 January 2006,"I saw this film recently, I was expecting it to just be a lot like alien vs predator (in other words 'not very good'), but to tell you the truth, it was pretty damn good. It had what you'd hope for, a great beginning, a great ending and story all through out the middle. If you're bored on a lonely Saturday night with nothing to watch, I strongly suggest that you go and hire this from the video store, It's not fantastic but it's very good entertaining. It is certainly a lot better then all the 'a nightmare on Elm street' and 'friday the 13th' movies and if you've read the empire magazine's you may have seen some of my article's on the and I've thought that 'a nightmare on elm street' was a good idea and 'friday the 13th' was pretty scary but Freddy vs Jason is a lot more entertaining. Admittedly Freddy VS Jason is not at all scary and more of an action but that was what made is more entertaining then your average horror movie. In conclusion I thought that Freddy VS Jason is very good and entertaining and you don't have to like all the other movies alike, so I suggest that you watch it.",Freddy vs. Jason
325,marccfantozzi,It's just not very good.,6,29 January 2021,I own this movie but don't watch it very often as it's just not very good. It took them 15 years to make this movie and this is what we got. To say I was very disappointed is an understatement.Also the movie is filled with plot holes and has beyond awful acting. I don't watch these movies for the acting but come on. They could have assembled a better cast.One of my least favourites in both series.,Freddy vs. Jason
326,Confidante77,funny,3,21 January 2007,"You know how at the MTV movie awards they make those little stints they show at the beginning, a spoof of say spiderman in which they introduce the two hosts? well this film was about as scary as one of those.The bit where freddy goes ""got your nose"" made me laugh uncontrollably and so did virtually every other line in the film (particularly the way freddy said ""b**ch"" every 3 seconds). The script is really quite appalling and was just a cheap excuse to make some money, as a horror movie it really is s**t.Wanna know how bad it really is? I saw this with 4 friends when I was 13. I laughed until I nearly p****d myself.",Freddy vs. Jason
327,sean4554,poor film and DVD,2,23 June 2008,"It took them a long time to finally get these two characters together...and why? It certainly couldn't have been waiting for a good script, because this is one of the stupidest that I can remember. Freddy's resurrection makes no sense whatsoever following on from ""Freddy's Dead"", for one thing. And on and on...bad continuity, bad pacing, plot holes, absurd framing devices, crappy set pieces - all a part of ""Freddy Vs. Jason"". The worst part of this film for me is the absurd aftermath of the field rave. After Jason hacks away at the kids, on fire and still unflinching, the main characters survive and just want to...go home?? GO HOME?? Wait a minute. If I saw a psychopathic zombie killing everyone in sight I'd get my family together and get the hell out of the town, county, state and maybe country. I certainly wouldn't drive 5 miles to go to bed. Would you? And is Ohio anywhere near Crystal Lake in New York? It would appear as though it's just a leisurely jaunt, but geographically speaking it wouldn't be, according to prior ""Friday"" films. And...after all the hype, the decade plus of myth making, neither character triumphs over the other. Not really. Which makes this piece of celluloid excrement even more pointless. One last thing...on the commentary track as well as the bonus features, the lead actress is almost never mentioned. You get the idea that the filmmakers and the studio were somehow embarrassed by Monica Keena's performance. Pretentious, sleazy, self-deluded fools; they could have put Ingrid Bergman in her prime in the role and she couldn't have been any better. Keena's persona non grata treatment here reminds me of the Wes Craven commentary on the original ""Elm Street"" DVD. He (and an actress) seem to really enjoy laughing at Ronee Blakely's acting and completely ignore the other bad parts of that admittedly classic but still extremely flawed movie (Ohio palm trees, lack of time continuity, sloppy direction, bad lead performance, etc). Of course; as Church Lady used to say, ""How CONVENIENT""! Unless you enjoy bad movies or just have to see all of the Jason / Freddy films, really, this is not a film you need to see.",Freddy vs. Jason

329,MaybeTomorrow,Clash of the Horror Titans,9,2 February 2007,"Freddy vs Jason: A fanboy's wet dream. This movie took long enough to get made and it's a great pleasure to finally be able to watch it over and over.Robert Englund (who else?) returns Freddy Krueger (from the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" films) and faces his biggest opponent yet: Jason Voorhees, the hockey masked undead killer (from the ""Friday The 13th"" films) who just won't die. When these two titans of horror come together for the first time, it's simply breathtaking.Director Ronny Yu delivers another new creative entry in an old series, like he did before with the fourth ""Child's Play"" movie: Bride of Chucky.""Freddy vs Jason"" does what it should and pleases both Freddy and Jason fans, although it's more of a ""nightmare"" film than a ""friday"" film. The movie features funny moments, brutal kills, cool special effects and is a roller-coaster-ride of fun and terror for every horror-fan.I'm totally down for a sequel!",Freddy vs. Jason
330,etzool,A great flick -- just don't go into it expecting horror.,8,25 January 2007,"While the Friday the 13th movies mostly tried to be suspenseful, true horror movies (their success or failure isn't really relevant), the Nightmare on Elm Street series has long been more focused on fun, creative entertainment with a few cheap scares to add to the amusement.Freddy vs. Jason fits solidly in the second camp. For fans of the irreverent style, horrifying puns, witty quips and generally light-hearted 'horror' common in Craven films, this one will feel familiar.However, if you're more in the Jason camp and want tension, an abundance dark settings and a guy running around telling everyone how doomed they are (I love that guy), you should go into this movie with an open mind -- it's probably not what you're expecting.Both fandoms, though, should be able to enjoy the gore in this film. While you might miss some of the more creative kills typical of both series, you'll certainly get your quota of gushing blood and severed limbs.While I'd recommend this to anyone who likes messy humor, I'd say Freddy fans would call it a solid 9, while Jason followers might see it a bit lower, as it twists his character a bit to suit the film.",Freddy vs. Jason
331,TitusYorick,Brains vs. Browne,8,12 February 2006,"This movie was one of the better horror movies I've seen, despite the fact that it's a sequel to two series that got REALLY old after their fourth sequel. I also thought this movie was rather unique too. Unlike most stories where there is a good and bad guy, this movie was different. There were two bad guys but there was only one villain. Jason was a bad guy, but he was only doing what he thought was his mother's bidding . . . and maybe a bit more than Freddy wanted him to do. I don't know about other people, but I was rooting for Jason the whole time, mainly because Freddy's little dinky finger-knives weren't doing jack s$#% against a hulking mass like Jason Voorhees. Even with other weapons Freddy couldn't hurt him. And when Jason got his hits in, they counted for sure. JASON ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
332,canardo-1,You can flog a dead horse!,8,17 August 2003,"My expectations weren't high when I saw this movie. I had given up on both series a long time ago. The town where I saw this didn't offer a wide variety of choices, so I saw it, and it turned out to be a good movie. The set-up worked both villains meshed well in the same story, which moved at fast pace. The nude young girls were absolutely beautiful, as was the modestly attired heroine of the story, who could act. (Contrast this with the first Nightmare on Elm Street movie.) The deaths were sensational, more imaginative than grisly. This movie was a good time.  The only fault was Kia. She should have died much earlier in the film.  The Kia characters are the real boogeymen of movies. They are like a stench. You can't get rid of them. They keep returning again and again from some other world. They give Freddy and Jason a kind of credibiltiy that transcends the movies that they are in.",Freddy vs. Jason
333,AlanBryan2112,2 Severed Thumbs Up!,9,24 August 2003,"Like all fans who saw Jason Goes to Hell we've been waiting years for this movie to come to light. I watched it less than 3 hours ago in a rural theater and an audience of about 20...mostly couples. No complaints from this small group and the girl who took my ticket claimed to have seen it five times. I liked it. I laughed (a most evil laugh) at some scenes and enjoyed the Freddy Vs Jason battles. The teen actors were quite good. John Ritter's son was just fine as the ""boyfriend who left without a word"". Kelly Rowland had a good moment or two teasing Freddy and insulting the poor nerd boy. Monica Kenna was good as Lori. At first I didn't think she was going to even survive but she got tough when she had too.Where did this Freeburg character come from? Was he visiting from the set of a new Jay & Silent Bob film? As comic relief he wasn't bad though and got to look tough for a scene. Deputy Stubbs character didn't get enough to do. He was on the right path and Jason gave him a shocking good time.My fave scene was Jason at the rave party. Well even before Jason arrived it was cool. And to prove these kids are very rural they don't take 'X' at a rural rave; they drink everclear!I would have preferred Kane Hodder as Jason. I saw the interviews with him on the Jason X DVD and he seemed to be really wanting this film. Why didn't he get it?As for the Freddy vs. Jason scenes?  All very good I think. I don't want to give away too much but I really thought they pulled it off.Yes, the movie has some humor. Yes, it has some nudity. And It really has some gore and slashing going on.

Basically, Freddy andJason are in hell. Freddy hasn't killed in a long time and thepeople in the town has forgotten about him.   The fact that no one fears him anymore makes him weaker. Sohe has counted on Jason to kill off some of his victims. At onepoint, Freddy gets stronger and Jason gets carried away andbegins to kill too many people. Freddy gets jealous and begins tobattle Jason. Suprisingly, the script really worked for the film. In the film, it isrevealed that Jason has been sleeping for years (which couldmean that Jason X was just a dream, thank god). The film wasalso hilarious, Freddy's smart remarks was well needed. There isa scene in the film where Freddy is choosing to kill either two whiteteens or the black female he chooses the black female by saying""ahh the dark meat"".    Overall, the film was packed with blood, gore and humor.

336,arlum_meow,okay movie.,4,1 August 2012,"freddy vs jason is a okay movie providing a few scares but the movie itself didn't feel like it was taking its self seriously. the cast was okay nothing fantastic. i must admit Kelly Rowland wasn't bad but could have been a lot better to be honest.the plot is really simple like it says in the name FREDDY VS JASON. there both killing teenagers such as ... Lori Campbell (Monica Keena)Will Rollins (Jason Ritter) Kia Waterson (Kelly Rowland) Mark (Brendan Davis ).so the deaths were okay i mean i thought they were going to be imaginative but they were the same salt of deaths jason and freddy would do in their own movies.the acting from the teens were okay but like i said could have been much better. also for a big film like this i would have thought they would have got some well known actors/actresses but it was names i haven't heard of before.i must admit there were a few jump scars with both freddy and jason but nothing that interesting you could remember over and over agen.the fight wasn't that great they wasted so much time leading up to the fight with th un funny one liners. overall freddy vs jason wasn't that good, if you ask me a waste of time and money.",Freddy vs. Jason

The story has not enough thrills to give goosebumps to viewers but the direction is tight and the director Ronny Yu does not let viewers to think what's happening. The editing is sharp which makes movie fast- pace. Action scenes are good except one in a climax scene where Freddy fights with Jason hand to hand,as they fight you think you are watching an martial art flick. Action directors sometime over does the blood and gore. Ken Kirzinger as Jason is menacing and so is Robert Englund as Freddy hats off to them.Otherwise, the remaining cast has done a fine job, nothing to shout about. Attention! As I told you above, there are no scary scenes to make you scream .Horror movie buffs will be disappointed. But, Freddy vs Jason is an entertaining slasher movie . let me give you an advice- watch it with your girlfriend .She will definitely scream and you.... can take advantage ! Got it!",Freddy vs. Jason
338,halopes,Nothing I was expecting!,7,21 November 2003,"I believe I had never seen a Freddy Krueger film neither a Jason one - a rather embarrassing statement for a film lover.When I decided to watch Freddy vs. Jason I was expecting first, not to understand it all due to lack of knowledge about the franchises, and second, I would watch pure crap. How was I wrong... Freddy vs. Jason is a horror movie like I haven't seen for awhile.The movie opening is rather good in establishing the two horror icons for people who might not remember, or simply, like myself, never watched a Freddy or Jason film. The film quickly establishes its mood with a house in Elm Street with the kids' parents away, buxom teens and a sex scene with nudity. There's also a teen in a shower, a brutal killing and lots of blood.At this point you know you aren't watching a straight, competent slasher but you are watching a b-movie that captures the feel of slashers from the 80s. Above all, you know you are not watching a politically correct horror movie like the ones filmmakers make today.What follows is a rampage of thrills and action, severed bodies, gallons of blood and bizarre killings in the midst of an epic fight between legendary Freddy and mythic Jason. Merit goes to screenwriters Damian Shannon and Mark Swift and Hong Kong director Ronnie Yu who, perfectly, manage to deliver a movie loaded with action sequences and chilling moments, where almost everything makes sense in its own universe and is easily accepted by the public.However, what amazes me the most, in a time where studios tend to be so politically correct, even in horror movies, is to see a studio like New Line Cinema release nation-wide a slasher without limits. Everything goes; from every possible imagined part of the human body stabbed and severed to themes like murder, sexuality, drugs and necrophilia, nothing was left behind.",Freddy vs. Jason
339,cecrle,So awful it made me angry.,1,30 May 2004,"This movie is a perfect example of soul-less corporate nitwits sitting around and hatching a hollow excuse to drain the pockets of stupid teenagers.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that the script probably took a few hours to write.  The movie has no cohesion, no flow, no pacing, no plot. Some special effects like the morphing look professional, but that's the only professional thing about this movie.  Full of stupid cliches designed to relate to teenage audiences (raves, slang, plastic surgery references, pointless shots of smoking and drinking, etc.).  This makes the original Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the Thirteenth series look like masterpieces of American cinema.  Of course I *knew* it would be a bad movie, but I thought it would be bad in an enjoyable way or at least entertaining in parts.  But it's not enjoyable.  It's depressing to think that American audiences are being fed this kind of drek (and giving it fairly good ratings, by the looks of IMDB's polls!).  So slapped-together, so hokey, so empty of any atmosphere or scares or anything worthwhile to redeem its existence.  If you see this movie and don't think it's AWFUL, you seriously have something wrong with you.  Seriously.  Robert Englund (the actor who plays Freddy) shouldn't have sunk so low as to accept the role in this movie--he couldn't have needed the money *that* badly.  All in all, I think this movie represents the inevitable extinction of the human race.",Freddy vs. Jason
340,Hprog,Like 'em? try 'em together!,8,31 October 2003,"I went to see this movie with the intention of having some fun, 'cause let's get real, they don't scare anyone. I did like the last Freddy movie 'cause I felt it was a very intelligent effort from Craven to create a different kind of horror, and the movie seemed to have been misunderstood. On the other hand, Jason Goes To Hell was a mess and Jason X was just a little fun in space. But this Freddy vs. Jason movie is a jewel in the genre!Ok, let's keep in mind that this isn't a movie to think much, see it more like a film for fans that will contain EVERY classic tip of the genre: gratioutius tits, tons of fake blood, the typical jokes, chasing with falls, EVERYTHING, and the best is that the plot still makes some sense, if that's possible.Only watch it if you're looking forward to have some good fun and you really like the genre and understand it the way it's meant to be. 8/10.",Freddy vs. Jason

But lets face it, I think an even better dual would be between Jason and Michael Myers. That would just be the ultimate confrontation. It would really decide who would be king of the horror, since the two are very very similar. This movie has now set a precedence, and hopefully there will more duals and battles to come between other horror figures. Bring it on!",Freddy vs. Jason
344,ajmayowski,Saved the Genre,9,21 December 2003,"This movie came just when i gave up hope for the entire genre... well, not quite, since Jeepers Creepers had me a little optimistic, and the Ring, while not great, was a good sign, but i thought this movie,F V J, would kill it.Nope. This movie was WAY more than anyone expected it to be, myself included. I saw it on opening night in a crowd consisted of two types of people: Sex-depraved teens craving nudity, and horror fanatics. While I am a teen, it was the second group i belonged with- the group that was waiting for this movie to continue the stories of the two greatest slashers Hollywood's ever known- Freddy, who hadn't been on the screen since ""New Nightmare"", almost a decade ago, and Jason, who had Jason X, which was a terrible concept, but New Line pulled something out of its butt and made it acceptable.Freddy, who's been neglected recently, although his last film, New Nightmare, was the last 1980's style horror movie made. Funny. It's also the 90's best horror movie. He's back for revenge, since he's been forgotten, so he's sorta P.O'd. He uses Jason to kill and strike terror into the hearts of Elm-Streeters, who have forgotten Freddy thanks to a drug called Hypnocil, and this Midwestern-town government conspiracy. Yes, i said Midwest, not Middle East(!). Hope I don't get arrested. I made a hint that criticized our government.The plan works, and Osam... Freddy, I mean, has everyone afraid of him, so he comes back, but Jason gets a bit greedy with killing people. What a mama's boy.But, yeah, from here, there involves this huge battle featuring some decent Freddy one-liners, though I prefer the ""New Nightmare"" Freddy, who's more business but uses the one-liners to get inside his victim's head- no, i don't mean physically, usually only his claw does that.Anyway, this movie officially put Ronny Yu on my ""Respected Directors"" list. He's saved two horror movie series now. Child's Play DOES have a film currently in development, though I don't see anything about that one IMDB. See ""Boogeymen"", a great compilation, for the FYI on that.I really think this is a good movie, the best in the ""Jason Series"", easily, since the first one doesn't really count as his movie. Does it? It's the third best in the ""Freddy Series"".Oh, yes, before the ""Grades"", beware the first few minutes after the Freddy Monologue. I didn't time it, but I'd say it's about 15 minutes long. It's the worst stretch of time in Freddy history. I remember just laughing to myself in the theater. I believe I said ""This sucks."" while chuckling.And one more note: When I was watching this, a group of teens, about 5-7 in number, enjoyed the nudity a lot. I recall one kid who said during EVERY kill or nudity shot ""That's what I'M talking about."" Actually, he only talked about what he was talking about. I wonder if most high-schoolers in America really are dumber than I am?

The deathscenes are as unimaginative as in all ""Friday the 13th"" films, just plain hack and slash everything that moves with anything sharp. The fightscene between Jason and Freddy was indeed quite cool, but far to short. I do not recommend this to anybody else that is not a fan of these series. I thought it was quite entertaining, but not scary at all and it didn't give me any chills. I'll give it a 7/10.",Freddy vs. Jason

I haven't felt this good about a fight since Rocky took on Ivan Drago. I went into this movie kinda concerned. Not because I was worried about if it would live up to the expectations I built up in the 5+ years I've been waiting for it... instead I didn't know who to root for!This movie was so good on sooooo many levels. I loved how both Freddy and Jason got some extra ""flashbacks"" explaining their motives/backgrounds.The gore was good, the acting was just cheesy enough to be fun, and the story was surprisingly good. (don't worry... no spoilers here)At first I was put off that Kelly Rowland got a part in this movie, and even enraged when she admitted that she didn't know anything about either Freddy or Jason (what the hell are you in the movie for? Give it to someone who's done some research.) But I changed my mind when I saw her in action. I'm not saying she's the greatest actor ever, but much better than some people who've been in the business for a few years.Go see this movie if you want a fun flick to end the Summer on (yes, it's past the Labor Day weekend, but FvsJ is still a Summer movie.) 17 stars out of 10!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
347,say_hi,Awesome *SPOILERS*,8,20 February 2004,"Freddy vs. Jason was awesome. The ending was very cool, but it could have been longer. The special effects were also good and Freddy torturing Jason was awesome. What I wonder though is why Freddy's town (can't remember the name) is back to normal after Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. Everyone in that movie was nuts in the head, now all of a sudden the town is back to normal. Weird. Also, *MAJOR SPOILER* (you've been warned) I'm disappointed Jason ""won"".

348,jagaleigh,A long awaited movie that satisfies all fans!,9,10 August 2003,"I was lucky enough to attend the world premier of Freddy Vs. Jason just last night. This event was hosted by the wonderful and unmatched venue of entertainment called the Alamo Draft House here in Austin Texas. (THANKS ALAMO!)This movie has been talked about and put on the shelf, and then talked about again so I don't know if anyone really knew what to expect. I have to say that years of waiting has paid off because this movie was a fast paced blast from beginning to end. This film had people ranting and raving and roaring, we all cheered and laughed, and I didn't hear one person that sounded disappointed in the finished product that is Freddy Vs. Jason.No matter if you are a hard core Freddy fan like me, or a long lingering lover of Jason and his camper killing antics (like so many others), you will walk out of this movie feeling hyped and satisfied. Period.The actors were damn good in this film, too. I particularly like Jason Ritter (son of John Ritter) in this movie. He was the most believable character in the whole flick. The other folks were good, mind you, but I felt that the main girl looked a bit too much like Brittany Murphey for me to get comfortable with her *not* actually being her.I just have this to say: SEE IT. It is worth your time and money, and you'll walk out giggling and scared and happy. At least that's how *I* walked out. :)",Freddy vs. Jason

One of the better films of (both) series, so if you're a fan of either 'monster', this is a treat.  If you're a fan of both film series, you're not even having to pay twice to see this, so it's a treat for you. :)",Freddy vs. Jason
350,jephiachantharath,Freddy vs Jason Two thumbs up!,7,8 March 2012,"This is one of the highest anticipated movies of its time, but was it worth the wait? Yes, it's not the best movie, but it gives so much excitement and action, that's all it needs. The title itself describes how the movie will go, ""Freddy vs Jason"", you know there's going to be action. This is the movie that made me a Jason friend in the first place, because of the great make-up the directer decided to use for both of them. The only reason why I give this movie a high rating, is because of its simple plot, and also that it follows the mood it's suppose to. It's not trying to be super scary or emotion filled, because the director knows that Freddy and Jason are now pop culture icons, and so didn't try to make them what they were. My only default with this movie is the how they meet,Freddy needs Jason to start killing so the people start thinking about Freddy. It's better than the other scripts that came in for it, but still; it's like Batman and superman, but then again there both in DC, and Jason and Freddy are both in Platiun dunes. In conclusion, this is a great movie, not one required to watch, but a great action packed movie to see on a movie night.",Freddy vs. Jason

352,wong-3,Fans won't be disappointed,8,26 August 2004,"After years of this concept floating around and hundreds of dumb scripts being turned down by New Line, The Claw Vs The Machete film is here, and it doesn't disappoint.Probably the reason it took so long to find the right script was down to its core concept - ""How do you connect Freddy's story with Jason's."" In an excellently edited 10 minute opening sequence we learn that after Freddy's demise, the people of Elm Street have forgotten about him. So he searches the realms of Hell to find someone who will make the people remember. Under the guise of Jason's mother he awakens the Crystal Lake slasher and orders him to Elm Street to murder its youngsters therefore making them remember the child killer. Only then will Freddy have the power to leap into their dreams and once again kill.However, Jason gets a bit too killer-friendly, angering Freddy. This leads to the battle of the title, and that's basically the plot.
The cast is stereotypical. Obviously you have your leading lady, the love interest and numerous 1 dimensional victims, who try and stop the two killers. Apart from some gratuitous breasts, Brendan Fletcher is the only real standout, his part mostly there for exposition purposes.The film is not scary one bit but is very funny and has some decent kills. When Freddy and Jason do battle, it reminded me of an MTV Celebrity Deathmatch contest. Its extremely passable and leads to a smart ending that sums up the film.For the genre it gets 8 pints out of 10!",Freddy vs. Jason
353,sahuagin,Not amazing but very good (small spoilers),7,18 August 2003,"I say the trailer for this film about 2 months ago after it suddenly appeared pretty much out of no where! The trailer left a lot to be desired...frankly it looked very poor indeed! Then a month ago I saw another trailer and it suddenly started to look a lot better!Last night I watched this in the local cinema and I would love to say it was absolutely amazing....but sadly I cannot!By no means was it a bad film...it was very sweet to see the two horror Goliath's facing off but while Freddy was in all his mean, stripy, one-lined glory, Jason was a weak, snivelling little thing!I know way too many people complain about this but I have to have my monies worth as a Jason fan....Kane IS Jason. This guy was good, I'm not about to slate him for the fact that he isn't Hodder. he did a good job...played the part well and was genuinely menacing at times (the rave showed this!) but Kane always has and always will be the true Jason! **SPOILER**When Jasons (supposed) mother appeared at the start, I half-expected him to cock his head and when the 2 guys in the corn-field at the rave saw him I was expecting to see his shoulders heave as he breathed. All this, added tot he character by Kane, made him all the more...intriguing..but enough of that gripe!The film was good fun...Freddy had very few one-liners which was a shame but he was more evil than usual...and the dream scene where Gibb was killed (and Freddy just missed out) was very good too see!Jason killed few people....only one or two of the stalk killings were actually seen tho....mainly he swings the machete and blood sprays a wall....toning down for the new millennium maybe?So the gripes I had were:1) No Kane 2) Not enough 1 liners. 3) Not enough Graphic violence. 4) Cheesy ending  (not gonna say it here)Good points:1) Good acting all round. 2) Great rave scene (burny hacky burny!) 3) Good stunts. 4) great idea....and about time too!So if you like NOES and F13th, see it! If you just like slasher films....rent it on dvd when it's out! If you just like general horror....let someone else rent it and watch through the livingroom window!Finally the ranking: 7.5 / 10loses 1 for lack of graphic violence loses 1 for lack of freddies general humour. loses .5 for what were actually very few kills!",Freddy vs. Jason
354,mancunianfatman,what the fu*k were you all expecting???? it is what it is!!,7,31 March 2010,"I mean seriously, it is what the title says. people complain about the story of the film, but i mean, what story would you have liked??? i would have thought the fact that 2 of the biggest horror icons ever facing off would have been enough, but people still aren't satisfied. The story that we get is straight forward - Freddy (disguised as Jason's mother) convinces Jason to go to elm street and kill teenagers, so that the teenagers will blame Freddy and he will be able to escape hell. so as Jason chops teens up, teenagers on elm street start dreaming of Freddy and consequently Freddy starts getting his powers back slowly.Thats the basics although there's some other bullsh*t about the ""lead"" teenager and some sh*t about her mum......who really cares kind of stuff.so the teenagers capture Jason like a fuc*ing animal, and take him to crystal lake, where our stupid blonde heroin comes up with a great idea - fall asleep and try to drag Freddie out into the real world! i mean seriously who the hell would be suicidal enough to try that. But as always our hero finds a way to and therefore Freddy is pulled out into the real world. Then comes the part that should have happened 60 minutes ago when they both start kicking the sh*t out out each other. and its a good battle, with good effects and good acting (as usual) by Robert Englund. i suppose i should tell you who wins but i hate to spoil it, but no doubt this review will be put next to other reviews, where other pricks have spoilt the ending. Any way i really enjoyed this film, its a good no brainer with blood and guts and of course Freddy and Jason killing everything that moves, what more can you ask for in a crossover between these 2 ????

355,armysbro911,Critics can burn,8,19 April 2021,This movie is awesome so badass. Is the story bad. I mean... Ive seen far worse in slashers. FAR WORSE. But we are here for Freddy vs Jason and man does it deliver. When we get to the fight it's so good. Fans of slashers rejoice this is a golden movie of two iconic slashers.,Freddy vs. Jason
356,rhyatt1,Peanut Butter and Jelly were great too until someone put them in a jar together...,1,25 March 2005,"This is the movie you always dreamed about when you were 10 years old. But looking back, you also dreamed about stood slapping Macho Man and mud wrestling Miss Elizabeth in the square ring, so what did you know? This movie is the worst product to ever come from such a great 10 second brainstorm. Everything about it was wrong from the set up to the finish. The idea that Freddy is no longer feared and must resurrect Jason to inflict terror and subsequently nightmares back into the masses is lame even for a movie about a zombie with a hockey mask fighting a disfigured demon who wears a derby.Sure these two guys were great in their own respective universes, but how did it ever get to the point where someone decided to financially back this movie? Like I said before, the idea of getting Jason and Freddy together sounds great...until you actually sit down and think about it. Apparently nobody ever did that with this idea and we all got stuck with it.The movie is made up of numerous horrible rehashed ideas that aren't worth mentioning or remembering. Luckily I can't remember most of them.So I'll skip to the final scene which gives us the big fight between Jason and Freddy that we've all been waiting one and a half hours and 15 years for. The CGI is so obvious that each character could have been given a life meter and an on screen time limit and nobody would have noticed. The fight scene itself was jazzed up with so many Matrix style flips and kicks that Bruce Lee himself may not have been able to beat these guys in a one on one kung fu match.This movie is proof that you can't relive the past. Jason and Freddy should have been left alone so people could dream about how great it would have been to see them fight. Unfortunately now we all have been slapped in the face with the knowledge that fantasy is always better than reality and movie monsters don't disappear once their respective careers fade away, they go off and study kung fu. Now put your Miss Elizabeth posters back in the closet and sell your copy of Freddy vs. Jason on ebay.",Freddy vs. Jason
357,Bailiff,Good fun,9,8 November 2003,"If you go into a movie called Freddy vs. Jason and expect soul-searching dialogue, powerful statements about the nature of man and timely and relevant social messages...I can't think of a way to finish this thought, because I can only ask why you bothered to enter the theater in the first place!The teens in this movie are fodder, the adults are ignorant, and most importantly, the blood flows freely.  Freddy vs. Jason does everything a good slasher should, and then some.  For many fans, this is the ultimate match-up.  The catchphrase-spouting, dream-invading 3rd degree burn-laced child murderer Freddy Krueger, matched up against the plodding, mentally challenged wrecking ball with an unusually proficient skill at handling sharp things that is Jason Voorhees.  The filmmakers did a terrific job here, incorporating mythology from both series effectively and devising lots of ingenious ways for Fred and Jace to go at it, either with the inferior mortals or head to head (the latter of which, of course, is the coup-de-grace of this film).  The dialogue is indeed corny, but also often funny in that enjoyable ""why-am-I-laughing"" way...actually it's a step up from most of the other films in either series.  And yes there are plot holes, but if you're looking for those you're once again missing the point. This is about Robert Englund, who gives the performance of a lifetime with all of his scowling glee intact.  Fans howled about Kane Hodder not being cast as Jason this go-around, but his replacement does a fine job as the silent goalie anyway.The unedited gore is also a godsend, as slasher films have been sanitized to the point of made-for-TV fare for over a decade now.  F vs. J's final battle is mind-blowing for series fans waiting patiently for years for this project to materialize.  Non-fans won't understand the crisscrossing symbolism that intertwines the two franchises, but the screenwriters definitely deserve kudos for treating the script with a care similar to Freddy's ""New Nightmare"" and Jason's ""F-13 Part 6"".  Also deserving praise is director Ronny Yu, who seems to revel in resurrecting long-dead horror series (i.e. Bride of Chucky).  He brings a definite energy to this film that a lesser helmer would fail to contribute.So which icon wins?  You have to see the movie...or, if you're like one of the gentlepeople I mentioned above, you'll probably want to back away slowly, scratch your head in confusion, then turn and run far, far away. Because you certainly won't ""get"" why people enjoy Freddy vs. Jason.",Freddy vs. Jason
358,DalKhan,Nothing New,2,23 August 2003,"Freddy vs Jason had nothing new to add to either series or the genre in general.This kind of movie has been done before with other horror movie monsters. Both ""The House of Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man."" featured classic movie monsters battling one another. And to be honest these movies weren't very good either.While the attempt to rework the formula for the Jason and Freddy movies was admirable, it really wasn't enough. It was not scary. And isn't that what horror movies are supposed to do? Scare people?Movies like Alien, the original Nightmare on Elm Street, The Exorcist were actually scary. They weren't just gory to be gory, they actually tried to shock and scare the audience.The only truly good thing about Freddy vs Jason was that it had a plot. Unlike the laughably bad Jason X.",Freddy vs. Jason
359,Specters,Clash of the Titans,6,8 October 2003,"Easily the best out of all the Elm Street sequels, and probably the Friday sequels as well (I can't really be certain as it's been a long time since I've seen some of the Fridays). But anyway, I thought the first half of this movie was the most suspenseful, where the second half sacrificed some of it's suspense for balls-out action which was done well. Ronny Yu seems to have a talent for taking mainstream horror films and turning them into well made, scary must-see movies. This one is definitely a must see! By the way...this review sucked...I am very aware of that.",Freddy vs. Jason

Instead we get the same tired Freddy puns, bad dialogue, a script that takes FOREVER to get going, and shockingly, some really cheesey looking effects not much better than your 1950's sci-fi schlock.  And after a while, watching the two maniacs hack away at each other got boring and pointless.  They can't die.  They've never died in any of the films, even when you think you've killed them. Therefore, that little wink at the end was not unexpected.  Entertainment Weekly said it took the producers years before they found the right script--should've kept looking.",Freddy vs. Jason
361,jasons_the_man_2000,The best of the two series!,10,21 September 2003,"I must say that I grew up in the 80's watching these two series. As some have said, some of the movies stretched the limit, but true fans watched through it all. To all of the people who don't like these movies and bash them, I have one word of advice for you. You don't have to watch. This is America and you have a choice not to watch something that doesn't appeal to you. These movies weren't made for you anyway. That said, I loved this movie. You could definitely tell that it was made in 2003, 20 years after the two were made, give or take a few years. There was a lot more nudity in this movie and the girls were very hot. There was a lot more gore and violence, a trademark of these movies. Lastly, there was a lot more swearing including very heavy use of a certain five letter word beginning with B. Like I said, I loved this movie! Judging from my past experience, they will keep these series alive, and they should. Even though there are a lot of people who don't like them, there are lots of true fans like myself who do. Take my advice, if you like these movies, go see it, it's awesome. If you don't like them, don't. Simple as that. Either way, it's still awesome.",Freddy vs. Jason

Ronny Yu obviously knew this movie would bomb, so he added the blood to scenes where it wasn't even that bloody (to make it ""look"" scary), no one (in real life) could lose blood in the middle of a room and have it flood all the way into the bathroom, How fake was that?! The movie is not even really what the title claims, it's just a bunch of teenagers on drugs!. If you took away the drugs and all of the other crap that was thrown in, you might have clips of what could have been good! I don't care what anyone says, this movie is a total waste of America's money, and it trashed both Freddy and Jason's reputations, and lastly, There better not be a sequel EVER!!

I found the audience and myself LAUGHING completely through out the movie.  At one point I had to ask my friend: ""Is this suppose to be a parody?""  The writing was horrible, the acting was worst, and with ever line spoken was the obligatory statements that is usually found in a cartoon making fun of horror films, such as The Simpsons.  ""...You know you haven't been with another guy since you were 14... You need to forget him..."" or ""Ever since Mom died...."" or the escaped mental instution patients turn out to be right.  It was just a horrible, horrible movie.  Not in the tradition of the orginal Jason & Freddy movies. Somethings need to just die and be forgotten.  Namely, this movie.",Freddy vs. Jason
366,Prophet1-2,Back to basics,7,14 August 2003,"Finally.  A slasher movie that gets back to where slasher movies came from - and lo and behold, its a movie that stars the two greatest icons of horror movie killers going toe to toe.This movie has everything you want in an installment of either of the two originals - Jason being his silent, menacing, unstoppable best, and Freddy being his sick, psychotic, creepy and blackly funny best.  Also, there is copious amounts of blood, nasty violence and a few good breast shots, as well as the ""you have sex and you die"" cliche that Jason worked to a T.If you liked the old movies, you will enjoy this.  I jumped once or twice; something I have not done at a Freddy OR Jason movie in a long time.  Its nice to see the movie get back to what made the originals the classics they were, in a way that will attract a new audience to discover what I have known all along - Freddy and Jason are the best there is at what they do, and what they do ain't pretty.  I enjoyed this movie a LOT more than I thought I would, and while it is not the best horror movie ever made, it IS entertaining and enjoyable.Give this movie a chance.  It may surprise you.",Freddy vs. Jason
367,zauis_at_mp,I went. I saw. I whimpered.,3,15 August 2003,"I went. I saw. I whimpered.Obviously, the producers felt that the concept of two slasher villains duking it out would be cool enough to get cash without needing to worry about little things like a coherent plot, common sense, or believable characters.  And, to a lesser degree, they are correct -- the _concept_ is great.  The movie itself, though, sucks blue whales through a hypodermic needle.I haven't seen a Freddy movie in a long time (as they immediately ceased to be even slightly spooky), but I did see Jason X.  Jason X was WAAAAAY better than this (not saying much).  This dump featured: bad story, bad lines, bad extras, bad pacing, bad special effects (yes, the special effects and gore were for crap), senseless actions to further the plot, a cast of 25 year old high schoolers with breast implants (serious, the movie is _filled_ with gravity defiant sweaters), a Jason Mewes wannabe, a laughably inept prologue, terrible backstory filling, rotten cinematography... oh, I could just go on and on and on...But was it fun?  A little.  But I hope the film tanks and sinks.  It deserves no cash as it is nothing but a poor retread of 'Scream' and insults every horror/slasher fan alive.  Plus Coke obviously shelled out a bunch of cash to be in the film, so why bother giving New Line _our_ money when they have good old Coka-Cola cash to fall back on?I also noticed a disturbing new trend: movies that have a rave scene.

It starts off from the very beginning with some bimbo skinny dipping...did I mention she had falsies...probably could of popped one of them with a pin needle. Push comes to shove Jason,the hero,comes along whacks the airhead off in a grisly scene then the fun begins. I laughed when she got it.You got hilarious scenes in the mental institute,and kia the big mouth,and you get to see a bunch of worthless never do well sh*theads die. Again yadda yadda yadda at the end the 2 duke it out. All in all despite the stupid naive teenagers you can only expect from such a film,a good film.

369,Heff2001,Did someone actually get paid to write this S*@t!?,1,27 December 2003,"I was a fan of Friday the 13th before many voters on this flick were probably born. Why? Go figure. The series plummeted into stupidity after part 2...disconnecting sequels and not even following the fate of Tommy from part 4. There should've been a REAL Tommy/Jason showdown somewhere, not the weak one form part 6.I was also a fan of some of the Elm Streets (Only 1, 3 and New Nightmare). 1 and 3 were the only ones with any inventiveness and 3 was actually a solid script. Hollywood loves to cash in on naive teens. They were doing it when I was young and they'll do it forever. My advice to the youth of today: use your noggin' and go make better movies yourself.That said, Freddy vs. Jason was so abysmally awful I could not believe what I was watching. The dialogue was the scariest thing in the movie. The acting was bottom of the barrel. Why was Lochlyn Munro in this flick...? Oh, yeah...paycheck.Now, I'm not saying that anyone should've thought they were trying to pull off Gone with the Wind but jeez, man... can you say ""try a little""? If you're gonna take hard earned (or borrowed) money from teenagers, at least write something that doesn't make them look or feel like complete idiots.I can't believe that someone got paid to write ANOTHER script that feels that teenagers are retarded (explaining stuff every five seconds JUST in case you can't use your brain to get it yourself). However, the fact that so many voters gave this 10 stars just makes me wonder if the screenwriter WAS the smart one and knew exactly the type he was writing for. Avoid at all costs...Freddy vs. Jason is lame in every sense of filmmaking. I'll sit through Plan 9 from Outer Space thirteen times in a row before watching this again.",Freddy vs. Jason

371,toronto_ghostbuster,A Disappointed fan - may contain spoilers,3,25 September 2012,"First, I'll start by saying if you're expecting A traditional NMOES feel, or Friday the 13th feel it's not there. A lot of the elements are there, but it just doesn't feel right.Second, the casting for the most part was done poorly. It's one thing when the actors are not A list, I actually like not knowing all the actors, it's another entirely when they are downright unlikable, and often annoying. The kind of acting that makes you cringe because it's borderline embarrassing. Not that the script helped or anything because the dialog would be hard for anyone to pull off. Third, the movie should have been called ""A Nightmare on Crystal Lake"" and the entire story should have been about Freddy and Jason accidentally stumbling upon each other. The concept of Freddy using Jason just in general is really amateur, and silly, and Freddy VS Jason sounds like a bad video game title.Fourth, Freddy narration was a STUPID idea and ruined Freddy for me in this movie. Who the heck is he talking to? The audience? so he knows he's in a movie? Is he talking to a guy writing his biography? Is he talking to himself? I mean I might be over reacting but come on! Freddy himself explaining the plot of the movie before the movie? Bad form.I could go on about this movie...Overall it feels like a direct to DVD on a tight budget. However, as a fan of the horror genre I can appreciate a totally cheesy movie from time to time which is why I gave it a 3 rather than 1, plus I could never give Robert Englund playing freddy a 1.",Freddy vs. Jason

On the contrary it was far from what I expected the most acclaimed physco killer Freddy Kreuger comes into contact with the other most acclaimed physco killer Jason Vorhees and boy is it a match up. The plot is put together so well that you don't even have to watch any of the Friday the 13s or nightmare on elm st to understand whats going on. The killings are gruesome and outrageous, worth your money.Jason has the colossal strength while Freddy has the brains and agility. These two killers together mean bad news bears. If your looking for an awesome kick ass Horror, Action, and Comedy all in one than get this! Freddy's classic humor made me laugh at even the most gruesome scenes and Jason's style of slaughtering made me not even want to leave the room to go pee.Bottom line get this movie if movie for the ultimate a nightmare on Friday the 13th",Freddy vs. Jason

Well I'll admit it was good, but it was nothing like I hoped.Most horror movies during this decade are pretty awful and not worth watching but this movie but this is actually a little bit better. I recommend this film for anyone who wants to kill a couple of hours. I don't think it's worth an Oscar or anything but it's good enough to buy or rent at a video store.So overall, I liked the plot, the script, and the idea of Freddy and Jason being the two characters fighting each other.

Boy I should still be waiting the premis is good but look at what the movie has to offer. They don't have Kane Hodder in it who in my opinion is the best Jason Voorhees ever they have some Short sissy looking guy with a last name that no one could pronounce. Kane Hodder defined Jason Voorhees. He was waiting for that role and what happened? In his own words Hodder said. ""If they wanted to hire a skinny bitch than they did a good job."" I agree with that. Not only did they let me down without hireing Hodder they didn't even hire Betsy Palmer to play Mrs. Vorhees they hired some granny that didn't even look like Palmer at all. But Heaven forbid they hired Robert Englund.

I thought the acting was cheesy (and the lead girl, Monica Keena, was laughably awful, with some of the worst lines ever in a slasher film) but I especially liked the rave scene and Robert Englund was once again a joy to watch as Freddy Krueger. I really wish they had had a clear cut winner though. I hear they are making a sequel sometime soon. I hope they do, as it will be a joy to watch just like this one was...if not taken too seriously.",Freddy vs. Jason
377,Bocklocke,Two Titans of Terror Tear it Up,7,10 October 2008,"Freddy Krueger of Nightmare on Elm Street versus Jason Voorhees of Friday the 13th seems like a match made in heaven, and the movie does a decent job of projecting that. The story in a nutshell is that the kids of Elm Street seemed to have forgotten Freddy and his deeds, and without fear Freddy has no power. So Freddy looks for someone else who can supply some fear and cause the kids to remember him, and that person is Jason. Everything goes according the plan at first but when Jason doesn't stop killing, Freddy has to stop him because he served his purpose. What ensues is an all-out brawl between Freddy and Jason and the kids of Elm Street are caught right in the middle. The plot is simple, which is good, and it provides a grisly and enjoyable slasher experience--of course providing you like that genre. Despite the fact the movie is not one of the best slashers featuring either antagonist it is still a good, bloody and sick ride.",Freddy vs. Jason
378,randomorwhat,A great homage to two long running styles,7,11 November 2008,"This film was originally written, with inventive killings and witty dialogue. It managed to maintain the skill of the first few films (in which Freddy and Jason were horror characters) but also allowed some of the dated and cheap humour which the sequels followed with.Some inventive new ideas, some great kills and an excellent ending fight sequence. The acting was good enough to allow the film to progress, but once again Englund steals the show as a demonic figure who can still make audiences worried about turning off their bedside lights.Well worth watching - better than any Nightmare film apart from the first and Craven's last. Better than any Friday beside the 1st and 4th.",Freddy vs. Jason
379,joeym42887,KICK @$$!!!,10,17 August 2003,"I was a big fan of the friday the 13th series, but I had never seen a freddy movie. So I had no idea what to expect from Freddy, but judging from the previews this looked very cool!This movie was AWESOME! Without a single doubt It is The Most Entertaining Movie of The Summer!!! Everything about it is awesome! The death scenes were really cool and this movie was alot better than the friday the 13th Jason X, not that it was a bad movie, but I thought the whole Jason in space idea was a bad one.Also, I read someone saying that they thought Kelly Rowland did a really bad job at acting, well I thought she did a pretty decent job, much better than other singer turned actors!When I went to see this movie there was ALOT of very little kids there, and I mean much younger than 10!!! This is not a movie for anyone younger than the 16, It has ALOT of Blood, Drugs, Sex, Nudity, etc. Parents, leave the very little kids at home!Overall, I think this movie is the comeback of the slasher flick genre!!! And it's about time!!!A",Freddy vs. Jason
380,booberry_rules,"Great fun, yo.",8,28 June 2007,"My God. Just look at my comment list. Almost everything I have commented on has been given a 1/10 or some other abysmal score. But finally, I'm doing something that I like. Something that's just plain great horror slasher action! I am doing Freddy Vs. Jason.The storyline is simple. Freddy comes back and Jason comes back. They kill people. They FIGHT! That's right, the two of them have one of the most kick-arse showdowns in the whole ****ing history of horror! This movie has all the stuff a good slasher movie needs. Is it scary? What do you think, it's Friday The 13th Part 11 and A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 8. So yeah, it's not scary. It's more of an action/thriller. I put the slash there to emphasize the amount of slashing in this movie.So yeah, watch it.",Freddy vs. Jason
381,FT13TomDinardiJV,Simply brilliant,10,16 August 2003,"When I walked into the theater for Freddy vs. Jason alongside my mom (yes, I'm under 17, and since I had gotten my mom to bring me to Jason X, I did it again), I was wondering what would happen. I mean, about 15 months earlier, I sat in the theater, waiting for Jason X to start, and I had known EVERYTHING about that movie. If there was a news bit that I could find in the 2 years I waited for the movie. This time, however, I didn't know much. I had read a few things, but other than that, everything was gonna be surprising.I am glad I didn't know much about the movie, because it was awesome. I don't want to spoil much, but I had heard about a Rave scene & the Freddy bug scene, and they were highlights of the movie. The battle sequences are insane, and the ending is pure genius.Critics have smashed this movie. That's funny, because they just treated it as a typical horror movie. They didn't even pick on it for not having the ending attached until opening day, which they probably would have done if they had actually seen this movie. Everyone that I know who has seen it has said it was awesome and intense. Ronny Yu is a genius director, and I hope everyone hops aboard for another Friday the 13th sequel, a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel, or the inevitable Freddy vs. Jason 2, which should kick as much ass as this one.",Freddy vs. Jason
382,Revenge_of_the_Madness,What I expected.,9,10 January 2004,"I put off doing this as I was not sure what to say.  I, unlike many people, went in just knowing this would be more action then Horror.  I was right but does that make it a bad movie?  Not at all, I enjoy seeing the Big Two up on the big screen together, could it have been better, sure. 
Making it more of a Horror movie would have been a start but overall I did enjoy it.  While Freddy was played by Englund as usual the Freddy we know and Love, Jason was Not played by Kane Hodder which is what I really wanted to see.  Ken did not make a real good Jason IMHO, not horriable but not real good either.  I hope the sequel/Prequel to either this movie or either series seperate lives up to the fans and what they want.  The fight scences between the two were just want you would expect and while Jason gets most of the kills, Freddy does have the upper hand alot of the time.Overall this was a good movie for the fans of both series, I think it tried hard to please fans on both sides, which is hard to do and I give them credit for that if nothing else.",Freddy vs. Jason
383,sithvol,Not a bad movie but man what a silly ending,7,15 August 2003,"Fans of both franchises should be happy, and Ronny Yu delivers buckets of blood for this fight to end all fights. Not a bad entry into either series...and the final battle is well worth going to see this film....but the final...three seconds...is god awful, although the movie was good enough that it really didnt blow it for me. 7/10",Freddy vs. Jason
384,Marcellas56,The ultimate showdown??...,6,4 December 2004,Was really looking forward to this after seeing all the nightmare films when i was younger and reading two good reviews of the film. It started off really well with Freddy recounting what happened in the past and how he died. Jason is revived to gather up the kids so Freddy can resume killing them. Thats when it turns into another Scream type movie and not a lot really happens thereafter. Until the end when Freddy and Jason finally get to do battle which was pretty cool and dark. Overall pretty disappointed as i expected more.I wont say who won apart from it was either Freddy or Jason!!It would also have being better if they had used the ending where they were made to do battle in hell in front of a million red eyes for eternity...,Freddy vs. Jason
385,switchboard85,"If you know what you're here for, you will be pleased",7,16 November 2020,"Considering the relatively mediocre depths both the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare o Elm Street"" franchises have sunken to in the past, this is quite the crowd pleaser, just so long as you know what to expect from a title like ""Freddy vs. Jason"".Yes, the non-killer teen characters may as well have numbers instead of names and they seem to go out of their way to move the plot or offer themselves up for slaughter, but that's to be expected at this point and this movie isn't trying to reinvent the wheel. Instead, it tends to lean into its slasher trappings and embrace them in a fun, self-aware way that doesn't come off as annoying or pretentious like ""Scream"". After all, you watch this movie to see how they bring 2 of the biggest 80's horror icons to do battle in whatever form that takes.
As far as that aspect is concerned, you definitely get your money's worth and not just in terms of a Mortal Kombat style deathmatch, but the clever ways the filmmakers use the characters' lore to actually draw them together in a ""plausible"" way that actually makes this a proper sequel to both franchises and doesn't feel totally disjointed for the sake of a one-off crossover. While this definitely shouldn't be anyone's introduction to either character, it also doesn't require an encyclopedic knowledge of the past 17 movies either.For fans, this is loads of dumb, tongue-in-cheek fun with just enough of everything you love from Freddy and Jason (not least of which being a respectable body count)",Freddy vs. Jason
386,riordantheking,Quite a guilty pleasure,5,11 August 2016,"The first thing you ought to know about this film is that it's dumb, and it knows it. It's not trying to be the next Citizen Kane, it's just trying to be a fun movie with heaps of gory kills.Robert Englund shines once more as Freddy Krueger, who enlists the help of Jason Voorhees to come back to kill more teens in their nightmares. Englund is clearly having a blast throughout the entire films, always smiling and exaggerating his movements. He even gets to thrust his genitals forward at one point. The character of Freddy gets the least amount of kills in the entire Nightmare franchise, at a measly one, which is disappointing. Freddy is pretty much the main character of this piece, he narrates the film, and he is the last character seen.Kane Hodder was replaced as Jason by Ken Kirzinger, who does an okay job. I haven't seen any Friday the 13th films, so I can't compare Ken's performance to any other Jason actors, but he's passable in the role. Jason is much more of a player in this movie, and gets little more to do than simply kill teenagers.The actual human characters are uninteresting and boring to watch, merely put in the film as backdrop for the gruesome kills and violent fight scenes. They get the broadest of character strokes. There's the virgin, the whore, the black girl, the nice guy, the jock, the nerd, the stoner, etc. Nothing revolutionary here.You can't mention Freddy vs. Jason without talking about the actual scene where Freddy fights Jason, and I must say, they do not disappoint. There are two of them in the film, both very different from each other. In the first, Jason is asleep and in the nightmare world, in which he is absolutely dominated by Freddy, but when Freddy is pulled into the real world in the climax, the tables are turned, and Jason ultimately wins the fight.Overall, Freddy vs. Jason is extremely dumb, with poor characters, and poor story, and bad CGI, but earns an average score because of simply how much fun it is.",Freddy vs. Jason
387,redder415,Brilliant with bad ending.,7,16 September 2019,"Freddy's been gone and forgotten by the people of Springfield; his power is the fear of teenagers, so Freddy found a way to bring the fear back by searching the bowel of hell. He found Jason as a perfect role to be his puppet, except he, Freddy, does not know everything about him.Once Jason get revived, he won't stop, nor get turned off, especially when Jason thought his mother is actually gave him a task to scare those teenagers on the Elm Street that was disguised by Freddy. Freddy's biggest mistake is lack knowing about Jason's personally, so he didn't mentioned to him that he is required to ""kill only fews and go back to his graveyard"" in which it doesn't work that way.With all of bodies piled up, teenagers are starting to run out, Freddy haven't got his power back. So, he blames on Jason instead of himself, and he somehow, got into one of stoner's body and uses tranquillizer medicine to knock out Jason, in which it doesn't make any sense since Jason is undead.Once Jason is slept, he entered Freddy's Dream world and learnt that his mother didn't gave him these tasks. Freddy kept attempting to kill Jason and failed repeatedly. Kinda odd that Jason is actually superhuman undead in Freddy's world. Later, Freddy learnt that Jason is scare of water, which is also odd that Jason doesn't have feeling and he was in water many time in other Friday the 13th series.On the way to Crystal Lake, the teenagers who carried Jason's sleeping body in back of the van, for some reason, believes Jason should've go back his home like it'll end on his killing spree or whatever; yup, it still doesn't work that way.After Jason woke up, he continued on terrorizing those teenagers whose had a feeling for him and wanna to help bringing him back home; stupid teenagers, right?
Freddy was moving on to different task by trying to kill this girl, who was trying to save Jason in Freddy's world, so that way Freddy can get his power back and...... he failed! Again! He's so freaking lousy.The girl work up and brought Freddy into the real world. Bang! Freddy Vs. Jason battle got started. What the heck is that? Jason bleed? Jason can feels pain? Jason's both eyes got stabs to blind and still able to see? Jason fails to use counterattack that was wide open in front of him?
Few beats up on Freddy and he got weak? Freddy is mastered in Kung Fu?The battle is ridiculous, but somehow enjoyable.
Jason won by kills more, taking a lot of beating and still standing up, refuse to die, and he's always came back.Freddy lost for failing to bring his power back, only kill one, got weak fast, got hated by everyone, and lost the fight.
One more odd is that Jason carry Freddy's head for some reason, and his winking at the end to cheer up the fan of Nightmares on Elm Street for being a loser. Ha ha.",Freddy vs. Jason

Any friday fan or nightmare fan must see this movie!!!  This movie has every element in an R rated movie,however,I was even surprised at the amount of blood in this film!!! This movie is the first big one on one horror fest, and it will probably be the best ever made.Consider this in mind: I predict Superman vs. Batman,Alien vs.Predator,Candyman vs.Hellraiser,the possibilities are endless. BE WARNED:DO NOT READ BELOW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!!!! MAJOR SPOILER!!!! WINNER REVEALED!!!!!!And the winner is: The hockey masked maniac of my dreams Jason Voorhees!!! The ending is great,Freddy totally mauls Jason throughout the film,but Jason and Freddy get blown to oblivion by a propane tank set afuel by our heroes,and Freddy emerges with Jasons machete (Claw arm disemboweled) it looks like Freddy is going to destroy everyone,until Jason impales Freddy with his own arm! Our heroine cuts Freddys head off,while Jason sinks to the bottom.The film fades to black,but not before Jason emerges from the water Victorious with Freddys head in hand.However before the credits roll,we see freddys eyes move and wink at the camera!

389,kaptain_donkeypuncher,This movie vs. an Unsatisfied Viewer!,3,10 September 2006,"This is another example of crappy crossover films (were looking at you Godzilla vs. Kong). The writers of this film certainly did a half-ass job on this one. They should have used a lot more common sense. For example: when that one smoking chick dies in the field, her friends aren't going to kneel down and cry at the sight of her corpse, their going to get the hell out of there! And Jason shouldn't have won, pretty much everyone wanted Freddy to win. The only thing thats scary about the film is that you just wasted a good 90 min. or so on a half done movie like this. I'm even sorry to say that Alien vs. Predator was better than this. Thank God the sequel for this film was canceled, or else it would be Freddy vs. Jason vs. Myers.",Freddy vs. Jason
390,kidjay,best out of both,10,15 August 2003,"if u r a freddy fan u will love this movie same goes jason fans alikethis movie was a great horror fest of blood,guts,nudity,and the battle between the greatest horror villains of all time.forget michael ""pussy"" myers he couldnt hang with these 2 villains at all.some people say that jason wins but HELL NO!It is a battle to the death but since neither can die...... think about it.31/2 stars out of 4.",Freddy vs. Jason
391,jayfril,Thanks Ronny!,5,17 August 2003,"I thought Ronny Yu did a great job of meshing the two storylines together. He didn't reinvent any stories, followed the two movies guidelines well, and for people that never saw any of the other films, he helped them out by retelling each story which i thought was awesome.  freddy had some classic one liners and jason had some brutal kills.  all in all, i'm very satisfied with the film and looking for somekind of sequel - maybe with michael myers!",Freddy vs. Jason
392,tiresija,Jason Snaps Freddy,8,30 September 2003,"I have seen recently 'Freddy vs. Jason' and I was delighted! The film was very, very good, most certainly one of the best horror films of 2003. Don't get me wrong, 'Freddy vs. Jason' isn't for everyone. If you don't like slasher movies- stay away from it. If you don't like horror comedies- stay away from it. But if you like your Nightmare and Friday films, gore galore, gratuitous nudity, cheap thrills- step right in! You'll have a blast! It's without doubt the best Jason movie up to date and it's highly superior to all of the NOES sequels. Robert Englund is the movie's highlight, but like in the first two NOES movies Freddy's presence is limited to some extent: and that's a good thing. Freddy from 'FvJ' is not scary as Freddy from the original Nightmare movie, but he's still able to act ominous. Monica Keena (Lori) is very well equipped for the leading lady in a film of this sort. She's young, blond, big breasted and screams loud. Her scenes with Englund were effective and convincing. She's no Maryl Streep , but for the love of God, this is 'Freddy vs. Jason' movie, it's not 'The Hours'! 8/10",Freddy vs. Jason
393,MistAh_Justus,The Main Event...,7,12 August 2009,"I remember growing up and talking about the possible battle of these two horror icons on the playground as a kid. Hey, with the teaser of it happening at the end of Jason X, it was clearly inevitable. It took ten years for the inevitable to happen, and not only was I looking forward to the bloodbath that would be a result of these two colliding, but it would also be my first Freddy film on the big screen. I had just turned 16 and was ready for the movie I had dreamed about as a kid...At the time, I was not disappointed even the slightest bit, hell, I even went back for more the following weekend! But as the years have gone by since it's release, I've matured as a person and as a horror fan so I definitely look at it in a different light now.The story really isn't that bad, Freddy must resurrect Jason to terrorize some teens and refuel the fear in the people of Springwood. The story's not what we're here for though, as we just wanna see these titans clash. Could have really done without the Freddy narration as it cheeses things up, but it's a sign of things to come as there are cheesy moments throughout.The acting isn't half as good as any of the other entries in either franchise, but somehow it just fits right in with the entire movie. Everyone involved knew the type of movie they were making so they didn't hold back on what they delivered on screen. I love Monica Keena, and her overacting fits right in to the vibe of the entire movie, especially at the final battle in the end busting out lines like ""Welcome to my world, B****!"" and ""This...ends...now"". Katharine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps) puts in a decent performance, as one of the better actresses involved. And I'm not even going to comment on Kelly Rowland, well, I just did, but that's it.Robert Englund returns as our favorite dream demon (thankfully), but unfortunately he doesn't get to stand toe to toe with fellow fan favorite Kane Hodder, instead he is replaced by Ken Kirzinger. I wouldn't say Ken does a terrible job but I would have really liked to see the Kane Hodder Jason face-off with Freddy, especially since both franchises have decided to go with different actors for their reboots, would have been a nice conclusion to the characters for both.Jason gets most of the kills, but overall it does feel more like a Nightmare film rather then a Friday entry. Ronny Yu does a decent job with what he has to work with, but a more qualified horror director would have been much appreciated. He delivers some entertaining kills like the death bed bend and the corn field massacre, but the horror itself is nowhere to be found.The main event, the mighty showdown we've all waited years for takes place as the conclusion to the movie (naturally). This is where, they got the movie right, as it's a complete bloodbath filled with awesome brutalness throughout the fight. Both smack each other around until they go flying (ya...flying) on to a dock, where we see some nice slicing n dicing take place, including both taking shots at each other using each others known weapons. Until the final blow is made by Monica Keena, completely taking Freddy's head off his shoulders using Jason's machete as she's all wet, bloody and p-o'd (and I'm not complaining!) Overall, it's a fun popcorn flick that delivers what we've all been waiting for, all these years. It could have done without the bad acting and cheesy fight moments (pinball Jason. really?), but it's an entertaining flick none the less...7/10",Freddy vs. Jason
394,Rapsucks499,Pretty decent slasher.,7,15 August 2003,"This is a pretty decent slasher. The acting is not half bad, and it actually has a storyline. Packed with action and plenty of gore!  There is also lots of enjoyable nudity shoved in the movie for no reason. The special effect were great too!This is a lot better than most Jason movies. Very diffrent from your average Jason flick. Robert Englud once again has a stunning performance as Freddy.  This movie also has lots of comedy, like Jason X. It is not the best Nightmare on Elm Street movie, but does the job.This movie is worth taking some time out of your day.  It is a really good date movie too.6/10",Freddy vs. Jason
395,crow_god_sama,Oh Yeah!,10,18 August 2003,"This movie is great for Freddy and/or Jason fans.  I'm a Jason fan myself, but Freddy was awesome in this movie as well.  You will not leave disappointed. You can't even tell when somebody is asleep or awake, until of course you see Freddy.  Not to give the story away but the plot is rather simple... Freddy is too weak to kill because everybody has forgotten about him, so he tricks Jason into going to Elm St. to kill for Freddy.  When Jason starts killing (which he is good at doing) everybody starts to remember Freddy, thus giving Freddy more power.  The fight scenes between Freddy and Jason are very cool.  Now I'm not going to tell you what happens but one of my favorite scenes took place in a cornfield...okay, nuf said. Also I laughed at this one girl's death near the end of the movie.  So I gave this movie a 10 and I would love to see it again.",Freddy vs. Jason
396,THEPIPEMAN64,Can it get any better,10,16 August 2003,"I have always been a huge supporter of both franchises.  When I heard Ronny ""Bride of Chucky"" was going to direct Freddy VS Jason I was pretty dissapoited.  But Mr.Yu totally redeemed himself because this is the best movie Freddy VS Jason could be.  This is barnone the most entertaining movie of the year.  The fight seens are excellent they cannot get any better than what they were.  Robert England is still at the top of his game.  Although Ken Kirzinger is no Kane Hodder he pulls it off very well.  The movie was as bloody as all get out and I enjoyed every moment of it.  The only major complaint I have is that Kelly Rowland sucks. She cannot act her way out of a paper bag.  But it evens out eventually.  By the way htis movie has the best ending that has ever been filmed and that is saying alot. I give this movie a 9 1/2 out of 10 and it deservers every star.",Freddy vs. Jason
397,K-Mac017,Good for what it is,7,4 June 2006,"Okay, let's just be real about one thing: nobody expected a vs film starring Freddy and Jason to be an Oscar contender or particularly intelligent, just another mindless slasher flick. FvJ delivers just that in all all-out suspenseful thrill ride filled with horror-slasher goodness and (some) unpredictable moments to keep it's targeted audience entertained. Yes, the acting isn't all that great in this film, but for a mindless slasher horror flick, would you expect anything more from it in terms of acting? I wouldn't think so. This movie does exactly what it was meant to do, and couldn't have delivered any better: have nonstop thrills, chills, and deliver gruesome and over-the-top horror violence. The movie is gritty, suspenseful, and while pointless (to some extent), the fight scenes in this movie manage to keep you on the edge of your seat and make you wonder as to how much these 2 immortals can torture each other before the end of it. Another quality aspect is that there really is no good or bad guy in the flick; the main characters look towards Jason to salvage them from Freddy, but if you'll notice, Jason isn't exactly a hero in this film, either. The thing about that is that it's not your average good vs evil type flick, and that's one up for this flick.Overall, I'd give it 7 out of 10. A little mindless, and some of the dialog and acting is kinda out-of-place, but it does a good job everywhere else all-in-all. Might be worth a rental from the store, possibly even good enough to buy for all the die hard Freddy/Jason fans out there.",Freddy vs. Jason
398,antonioeku2,People Die... Legends... Live Forever!,8,9 October 2007,"Who else but me would be more than willing to wait 10 plus years for a movie to be made? Well, everybody when they don't have a choice. But who's to say that the other people were even waiting. Most think, ""Oh well,"" and forget about it once a movie's mentioned up until release. Not me. I waited. I waited a long time. I mentioned it to people and they kind of laughed it off. But not me. I took it serious. I thought about the possibilities of this movie. And I waited. I waited and finally the day arrived. So much hype from the media. So much hype in my head.Did it deliver? Oh man...did it ever.Okay, let's face it. This is ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 8""...and ""Friday the 13th Part 11"". But man...this one actually has something going for it. It's two in one. It's the most originality the series has ever shown. Freddy is powerless from the start. He brainwashes Jason using a MOST EXCELLENT technique and Jason leaves his old stomping ground to take care of Elm Street and bring fear back to the place so Freddy can regain power. Sometimes the movie feels like a Friday the 13th film. I admit that though it does lean more towards a ""Nightmare"" flick, Jason is a very important element in this movie. It was pulled off really well storyline-wise as far as how Freddy manipulates Jason. Some of the ways the kids in the film come up with attempting to stop these two are kind of ridiculous, but this is Freddy vs. Jason so it probably won't be nominated for an Oscar anyway. It does an excellent job at tying in their back stories and adding to them but where does the story lie? In the fight that's where! This is the best fight I have ever witnessed in cinema history. I am being totally honest, though I may be partial since I love these two characters. This brawl is worth the price of admission twice. Lots of mind games are played and lots and lots of brutality ensues.Some of the ""teens"" (or twenty something's playing teens) weren't so great. Kelly Rowland (of Destiny's Child fame) isn't a superb actress but usually most singing stars don't do so well - not terrible, for her first movie but I'm not a fan either. A few of the ""teens"" do okay. Jason Ritter and Monica Keena are believable as Will and Lori. The dialog throughout the movie is pretty terrible. But it's a Freddy and Jason flick. Come on people! Ken Kirzinger takes over the reigns of previous Jason Kane Hodder and does a decent job, but it doesn't take much talent to play Jason. Robert Englund totally shines as Freddy. He IS this character. He is so frigging evil that you just have to smile when he is up to something. My kind of character Ronnie Yu reinvigorated these two characters like never before. Some of the scenes were totally breathtaking. The fight sways back and forth and the direction forces you to get right into it. The crowd clapped, cheered and it was unlike any movie going experience I have been to. I credit this to Mr. Yu. He may have outdone himself.I don't think I could have been let down by this movie (like the entire series of both films), but I'm not afraid to admit that even I was surprised at how good it was. You could tell that the crowd was a mix of horror and non-horror fans, but everyone was having an awesome time in the theater back when I saw it the first time. Most nobody was talking down to the film during either of the viewings I attended. Everyone got into the movie and it was great. I had a blast and was sucked in during the entire movie...and once the brawl began, I had to get on the edge of my chair. It was an adrenaline rush, to say the least, to see two of my favorite cinematic icons going toe to toe. It's an exciting flick.If you like horror SEE IT...if you don't like horror but like a lot of action...SEE IT. It's also got a few humorous moments that will play out well to the comedy crowd. I don't think I have to even say it but I will...I love this movie. SEE IT!",Freddy vs. Jason

I can't tell you how many times I have seen this movie. And I also hope hope they come up with a good sequel, they can make a whole franchise just based on the two fighting each other.

Ever since 1984 when Freddy was introduced, every one has always had conversations about who would win in a fight between Freddy and Jason.  Freddy VS. Jason proves to be a greater fight movie since Rocky or Fight Club.  People were hooping, oohing, ouching, laughing, and cheering in the theater I was at.  The expressions at certain discoveries that Freddy has on his face as he fights Jason are great.  The things Jason does to Freddy make you grit your teeth and moan in pain for Freddy.  They both whip up on each other pretty hard while eliminating the immoral and irresponsible teenagers in the movie.  If you do not know the histories of these two characters, there is nothing to worry about.. this film has that covered in great and very interesting detail also.

403,njscreenwriter,Fun movie - not supposed to be scary!,8,15 May 2009,"Saw this 6 years ago in the theaters and loved it. Now I'm watching it on TV so I decided to throw my 5 cents on here.This could never have been a scary movie. Maybe if you were a little kid, but otherwise, no, not scary.It is a fun movie with some great one liners and a halfway plausible premise for a world where the boogeyman kills you in your dreams and Jason never dies. Some of the actors were terrible, some were actually pretty good.For starters, a good actor cannot save a movie from bad writing. Jason Ritter and Monica Keena aren't bad actors, but their characters in this movie are stereotypical - by their very nature the role of being in a 'horror' movie means they're going to get some bad lines and ridiculous situations. That pretty much guarantees campy performances! Seriously does anybody take a role in a horror movie expecting to win an Academy award? Now Kelly Rowland and the stoner dude definitely are not good actors! The fight scenes were fun, a good dose of humor, some hot girls, and a couple horror movie icons duking it out? What's there to complain about?",Freddy vs. Jason
404,happyakazukin,Pointless,2,25 March 2009,"This movie annoyed me because of how pointless it was. The money put into this film could have been used in a far more constructive way. Besides developing the Jason character, it had absolutely no substance: no plot, no substantial dialog.... It was just people screaming and thinking they're going insane (it's a horror movie, of course you're going crazy). You've got mindless violence and a sex scene- but they were not enjoyable. It was obvious they were put in there as a last resort. It was like the movie was so horrible they had to 'spice it up' a little. I don't remember the characters names... it was just random horror events happening, which were more disgusting than scary. There were no characters in this movie, it was just a bunch of idiotic, stereotypical, flat, generic teenagers- none of them had any development or were likable in any way.I felt like my IQ had dropped once it had finished, it was a chore to sit through so I never want to see it again. It was a total waste of time.It gets points for special effects.... everything else is a big fat 0!",Freddy vs. Jason

But then Ebert must not be a fan of either movie franchise; if he were, he would have undoubtedly loved this film.  None of the Friday or Elm Street films are particularly life-affirming, nor are they on par with more serious and thought provoking attempts at horror such as ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Omen"" or ""The Exorcist.""  Instead, these films have set out to achieve the highest level of entertainment possible for an audience prepared to switch off their brains, sit back and enjoy.  The last few installments in either series have failed to do that much (particularly ""Jason Goes To Hell"" and ""Freddy's Dead"", both of them utterly worthless), but this bigger and better addition to the 80s B-Horror-Movie mythos is absolutely certain to greatly please the fans of the genre.

And fake Implants (Monica Keena.)Some kid who thinks he's Jay from Clerks. And you have the formula for the film. But who goes to these movies to see the teens? Robert Englund again gives a great performance as Freddy the Psychopathic Child killer from beyond. And Ken Kirzenger playing a somewhat 'taller' Jason Voorhees gives the expected performance. Of course if you're Jason you don't need to be Anthony Hopkins in the acting department.The film is basically a giant gore fest which should be what you expect. And this movie delivers nothing but blood and gore. However Jason getting all but one kill is not that awesome. I wanted to see Freddy do some old school nightmare stuff. Not play Ping Pong with Jason Voorhees. (Though that is reminiscent of the old Elm St Movies.) Pack in some cheesy one liners. Some predictable deaths, (Some not so much.) And you have your movie.

Straight out of a desire to bring two horror icons together on the big screen meant a lot of patience and a lot of bad scripts. It was the dream of many slasher fans, and it left them saying... ""eh. It was okay."" It's now 13 years later, and in comparison to modern crossovers such as Alien vs Predator, Batman v Superman and Marvel's The Avengers, Freddy vs Jason has that distinctiveness about it that throws off a vibe that these two have the ability to belong in the same universe, but is highly unnecessary. Every time Freddy says Jason's name, it feels like a breath of fresh air and makes me want to rewind it to see if I've heard the line correctly. With today's modern flicks, it stands as a treasured memory of what can happen if the fans clamor enough to see it happen. This movie did what modern movies should have been doing around that time, which begs the question ""why weren't they?"" But still, this one is better than both reboots that spawned after it.

So, we can only trust the opinions of other fans and here's mine. ""Freddy VS Jason"" is great!  This film clearly has a higher budget than most of the sequels in both series and is much more stylized than most entries.  The premise is frightning and both killers are at their best. The desings of both Freddy and Jason are in top shape.  Freddy's make-up is at its best since the first two ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" films and Jason looks better than he ever has in his hockey mask years.

After Mst3king the heck out of JasonX with some friends though, I was hoping for a similar experience here.Unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously. Do I care about Jason's problems? I'm sorry no. There are a legion Ft13th movies that cover that anyway. At at then end of the day, he's an undead serial killer, I'm just not going to get that sympathetic.Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not, but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie, it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch...only not funny.",Freddy vs. Jason
414,kristian-bakdal,damn funny,6,16 November 2003,"Lets face it (western) horror movie are basically just absurd comedies. What makes this one good is that Director Ronny Yu  seems to embrace this fact and throws in tons o cliches and funny one-liners that underline the fact. By doing this and throwing in several gallons of blood he manages to make a damn funny horror story. I haven't seen that many of the Jason movies, but good old Freddy i have seen a lot of times before. Freddy is back and funnier then ever. Jason is okay but as such not that interesting, since the guy has no lines and just walks about poking people with his sword. What's the fun in being the bad guy if you don't get to say the cool lines. The teens are okay, however Monica Keena breast proved to be a major distraction during the movie (damn my raging hormones). The only single actor who got on my nerves was Kelly Rowland, for what reason I don't really know she just seemed out of place in the movie.

I'd already seen it in the theatres when it came out, but to see it in all it's glory it's best to always see it again, even if you didn't enjoy in the theatre. But here i bought it because i loved it in the theatre, and i liked it a helluva alot more when i watched it on dvd.This movie has everything and more.1). it has the violent death scenes, which are done with surprisingly what seems to be alot of effort and that's hard to find in horror films these days.2). Robert Englund is awesome this time around. In the past movies even though he was good, he was never this funny of this scary. I have to say some of it is because of the advances in the special effects world. And others is that Mr. Englund is one heck of an actor.3). The young actors in this movie unlike in past movies are actually decent young actors. So i was actually sad when certain characters kicked the bucket.4). Lastly, the story works well and so does the actor who portrays jason. So in the end it wasn't half bad.I do wish they had gone and done the orignal ending which consisted of freddy and jason going to hell to fight and just before they entangle them selfs in a fight to the death. A pit opens in hell and chains fly out and stab jason and freddy, and while their fighting the chains pinhead rises from the bowels of hell and simply states, ""Gentlemen, What seems to be the problem?""Would have been one the best endings of all time i would think, but the one that we have is fine.

Plot is ridiculous , acting is bad. You can really tell the producers had no idea what they were doing. Story is all over the place, it is very clear no one knew what they wanted out of the movie, except the conflict between titular characters. This was simply a cash-grab with no value whatsoever.3/10 out of respect for the franchises and their cult statuses, and for managing not to bore me for an hour and a half, even though everything about it is awful.",Freddy vs. Jason
418,ITTMovieFanatic,Just what both franchises needed...,8,18 July 2004,"I'm a big fan of both the early ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies. But both series' started wearing out their welcome with the repeated sequels that followed. So after 10 ""Friday the 13th"" movies and 7 ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films, somebody decided that it would be a good idea to put the killer from the ""Friday the 13th"" series (Jason Voorhees) up against the killer from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series (Freddy Krueger). This idea apparently went on for years, but nobody came up with a decent script that anyone liked. That was until a few years ago when a couple of screenwriters wrote a draft that executives at New Line Cinema (the studio that owns both franchises) really liked. So New Line gave the go-ahead, the movie was made, and the final result was ""Freddy Vs. Jason"".
This is what both franchises really need. Both the latter ""Friday the 13th"" films and the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies failed to ignite the box office. You'd figure that after the poor box office performances of the last movies in both series' (which was ""Wes Craven's A New Nightmare"" from 1994 and ""Jason X"" from 2002), both franchises needed a big boost. They got that boost thanks to ""Freddy Vs. Jason"", and deservedly so. This is a very entertaining horror movie that's at times very gory, and at other times very exciting. Plus, it was a big hit at the box office. The plot of ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" is pretty simple. It starts off with both Freddy and Jason up to their usual antics, but this time climaxes with the two killers facing off against each other. The question everybody asked was ""who's gonna win?"" For me it was a fun ride getting there. Director Ronny Yu (""Bride of Chucky"") keeps the action going so that it never gets boring. I was pretty much into this movie from start to finish. If there was one thing it didn't care much about ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" is the acting from the young stars. While there are good young actors here (Monica Keena, Jason Ritter, Kelly Rowland, etc.), there's really nothing special about their performances. They're performances weren't real bad in this movie, but they'll be better in future roles (Ritter, son of the late John Ritter, already has a role on a critically-acclaimed TV series, the recent Emmy-nominated CBS drama series ""Joan of Arcadia""). But if there is a good performance here, it comes from Robert Englund, better than ever in reprising the role that he originated in 1984 as Freddy Krueger.
So if you're a fan of either ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" like I am, or even if you're a major horror movie fan, then you're bound to like ""Freddy Vs. Jason"". It's great, gruesome fun!**** (out of five)",Freddy vs. Jason
419,SleepKills,We waited all those years for this?,6,18 October 2010,"It took years to come up with a way to put Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees together. And while Freddy was killed off for good by his creator Wes Craven in '94 and Jason went on to fight in space, writers were busy coming up with a story for Freddy vs Jason. And in 2003 it finally happened. Was it going to be the fight all the fans were waiting to see for so many years? Well, not exactly. It's funny how it took so many years to get them together, while in the end the story is very basic. Freddy returns, he resurrects Jason and Jason starts to kill. Yeah, that must have taken a long time to write. Thank god we are dealing with two very entertaining icons, who don't really need a good script to make a decent, entertaining movie. Robert Englund returns as Freddy Krueger and shows the glove still fits, even after all those years. You can see he's enjoying himself a lot playing Freddy once again. Jason Voorhees got a nice make-over (he looks way better than he did in, say, Jason goes to Hell) and director Ronny Yu was brought in to get some really interesting fight scenes. It's a 90 minute Celebrity Deathmatch, with two great icons who do anything possible to take each other out. Now that's entertainment.The sad thing is that every scene that doesn't include one of the two iconic killers turns out really bad. The characters are blank and boring and the acting is really, really bad. Especially Kelly Rowland and Monica Keena are really awful. Both were obviously not cast because of their acting. But it's not just the characters, there's a lot more boring stuff. Like the plot. It's great to see the opening scene with Freddy or moments where he fights Jason. But really, who cares about Lori's mother, Lori's father, Lori's friends or Lori's troubled boyfriend? You've got two of the best characters in horror cinema and you focus half of the movie on this horrible character? Why? But there's more bad news, seeing non of the characters are at least a bit interesting, they're just laughably bad. Like how in the world am I going to take deputy Lochlyn Munro serious? And why should I care about his nerd who has a crush on Rowland? Because I don't. So as you might guess, all are hope is on the two murdering maniacs. Yet even though they get some cool scenes together and the Krueger one-liners are nice, the make-up of Freddy just doesn't look right. Where's Kevin Yagher when you need him? And also, whereas Jason Voorhees gets some great kills, good old Freddy only gets one pathetic and lame kill. Why in the world didn't he get to do something? I rather watch Freddy kill some teenagers in stead of watching Lori and her obsessive whining. Hell, I'd rather watch paint dry than watching Lori arguing with her father.But at the end I have to say the film wasn't all that horrible to watch. It was at least entertaining, especially when Freddy and Jason are finally face to face near the end. Too bad they had to include all those clichés, those horrible bland teenagers, bad actors and CGI. Some better writing could have made this film another great addition to the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th series. Now it's just a decent horror flick. Too bad this had to be the last time we saw Robert Englund as Freddy. But then again, it could be worse.",Freddy vs. Jason

Having said that, I must apologize in advance if I say something completely stupid.If you didn't have a clue about Friday The 13th or Nightmare On Elm Street and you went to see this movie, chances are you would have probably walked out in the first 15 minutes, and if you actually sat through to the end you would more than likely be found babbling uncontrollably in the foyer afterwards. For fans of either franchise, this movie is the equal of a horror fans wet dream - a match up made in hell!With that said, the reaction from fans of both franchises about Freddy Vs Jason is mixed. If you went in expecting a dark horror movie, forget it. If you went in expecting a dark action comedy with over-the-top gore, then you are probably closer to the mark. A lot of fans are extremely disappointed by this movie, and I can certainly can understand and accept their point of view - the characters and atmosphere of the movie hardly resembled what made F13 and NOES classic slasher movies.My personal opinion, as a casual Freddy and Jason watcher - I didn't mind the movie overall. I didn't go in expecting some amazing storyline with tense and scary scenes - I knew it would be a cheesy over-the-top battle royale. To be honest, I found the majority of the movie very average. Although it all changed when Freddy and Jason mixed it up onscreen, especially in the last 15 minutes, I really enjoyed it.
**** SPOILER ****The final battle at Crystal Lake was a riot; unfortunately it only happened in the last 10 or 15 minutes. Watching the tiny Freddy climbing up Jason like a ladder and elbow-smashing him was rather amusing. Followed up by the scene on the construction site with the ""torpedoes"" flying past Jason, and the steel rod scene (which reminded me of something out of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.**** SPOILER OVER****What I found amusing in the over-the-top fight scenes and gore would more than likely mortify diehard fans of these franchises - and I can certainly understand why it would. To them this movie essentially take everything great about the characters and the movie franchises and basically dumb it down and turn it into nothing short of a farse.Hmm it kind of sounds like I'm sitting on the fence?... well no - I'm just trying to see it from different points of view. The casual Freddy/Jason fan will probably enjoy this movie, but if you are a real fan of the series then I would imagine you will either love, or hate it with a passion.With the box-office battle for Freddy Vs Jason almost over, the rumors of a sequel where more horror icons are thrown into the mix has heated up - is this a sign of the horror (pardon the pun) that we around about to see unleashed on the box office in the future?I gave the movie an 8/10 purely for the end battles with Freddy and Jason... if it didn't include the battles I'd probably give it a 3 or 4 out of 10.",Freddy vs. Jason

I was really interested in seeing this movie for quite a while, and I thought it was pretty good. Without Freddy this movie would be unwatchable. The reactions, comments, and facial expressions of Robert Englund are priceless. The film starts with a Freddy monologue, where he gets you up to date on past events. Soon we are introduced to a new gang of basically boring teenagers. This is the slow part of the film. The movie really takes off when Freddy shows up, and does battle with Jason. I've never been a Jason fan (I find him to be sort of dull), I guess he appeals to people who enjoy watching teens meet their maker. Freddy is so witty, clever, and has such a great attitude, and body language, that the character itself has always been of a higher quality than the movies he has been in (for the most part). The battle is fun to watch. I liked when Freddy said ""Hey A**H***, up here"" to Jason. Funny stuff! This is basically a monster movie where the fans get to see two monsters in a brutal fight. As for who won; get real people! These are movie characters, and were never alive. These characters will survive as long as people buy tickets to see them. You can ask MC Hammer about that. Elvis Presley though dead, still has a career. So in the end, the fans got to see these two psychos go at it, and that's the point of this movie. Oh, and watching Kelly Rowland die was a pleasure!

For example which I will not spoil too much, during the final confrontation  of Freddy and Jason, it might of been nice for the human characters to stay out of the way. Other then that, with Freddy and Jason running the show, this movie is an awesome horror extravaganza.

If you are a Freddy or Jason fan, this movie is a must. Even if you aren't, check this movie out of you want to see some real, old school stuff - from the masters themselves Freddy and Jason.*Spoilers* The movie starts out with Freddy in his human form, talking about his life, how he used to kill children, and how the mothers killed him. He tells us how Elm Street and the rest of the world had forgotten all about Freddy. He tells us that without the people of Elm Street having no fear, he cannot come back. He becomes Pamela Voorhees and tells Jason to go to Elm Street, and put fear into the kids. Jason does, and speculation grows leading to people thinking that Freddy is back. However, the police department want no one to even mention Freddy's name, and all traces of him have been deleted. As Jason slashes and dashes more people, the people of Elm Street become more scared, and that is when Freddy has regained his powers, and can now take over.However, Jason is now killing everyone, leaving no victims for Freddy to handle. Freddy gets very mad about this, and uses some sort of medicine to make Jason go to sleep. Jason and Freddy finally meet in the dream world, and Freddy throws Jason around, totally kicking his ass. The kids in the movie however are trying to get Jason away from Elm Street, back to Camp Crystal Lake. Lori goes to sleep to try and bring Freddy into the real world so Jason can finish the job, and kill Freddy at Camp Crystal Lake. Jason wakes up, causing the kids to run in terror. Lori finally gets Freddy into the real world, Jason and Freddy go one on one...Freddy and Jason start killing eachother for about 15 minutes, Freddy uses everything and the kitchen sink, but Jason just won't die. The battle ends at the dock when the kids throw gasoline over our villians, and lighting them on fire. They both fall into the water, and when the kids think all is safe, Freddy pops up for one final scare. However, Jason is right behind him and stabs Freddy with his own arm that Jason had previously sliced off and Lori hacks Freddy's head right off. Freddy drops dead into the water, and so does Jason soon after from getting his ass beat to a bloody pulp.The villians are dead... ...or so we think.Jason emerges out of the water at the end of the movie, so we think that Jason is the clear-cut winner. However, Jason is holding the head of Freddy. We think Freddy is dead, but the camera focuses on Freddy, and Freddy gives us a comical wink to signify he isn't dead, and probably has more plans for Jason in the near expected sequel.Great movie, the acting could have been better, but Freddy and Jason stole the show. 9 stars.",Freddy vs. Jason
429,NorthEgg,This movie delivers all the goods with the impact of a machete through a teen's head!,10,8 September 2003,"Without hyperbole this movie was worth waiting ten years for. Taking enough time for the special effects to finally be special enough to highlight the gore and surrealism that are trademarks of both films was a brilliant move although I'm sure that the contract lawyers were the only ones who could accept credit for the wait. If we had seen this film in the late 80's when it was first proposed the inevitable claymation alone would have killed the movie. I was thoroughly excited with this movie and I have but a few gripes to issue.Firstly, Jason is given a `weakness' in the plot concerning his supposed fear of water which was woven into the plot as a result of his boyhood drowning. This fear is completely fabricated as there has never been evidence of this fear in any of the other Friday installments. In fact Jason seems to love the water and can't seem to resist a classic water kill for too long. This inconsistency was obviously needed to level the playing field between the two titans as Jason seems (in my eye) to be the favorite combatant on paper. Secondly, there was no reason whatsoever why Kane Hodder should have not reprised the role that he helped to define. Director Ronny Yu stated that Ken Kirzinger was taller and had more sympathetic eyes and that these were a few of the reasons that he was cast in lieu of Hodder. Kane Hodder is a scant 2&1/2-something inches shorter than Kirzinger which could have been compensated for if that were really a concern. Lift boots or camera angles alone could have taken care of that. And eyes? Get real! Not only are Jason's eyes hardly ever of great importance, but Hodder could have delivered sympathetic eyes easily its called acting! Throughout the years Kane Hodder has imbued many Jason-isms which are now essential to the character: the classic tilt of the head; that little extra force he uses from kills to smashing something just to show power and determination; and the awesome long-gaited non-hurried stride are all courtesy of Mr. Hodder and we Friday fans have come to love his work. That being said, Krizinger did do a fantastic job and he had obviously done is homework on the character, that and being involved in Jason Takes Manhattan gives him insider credibility with us splatter-freaks. The last gripe of mine was Freddy's over-use of the word `bitch'. It's a pseudo Freddyism and I can understand it being used once, and even twice when Freeburg uses it just so the slow members of the audience  can realize that he is now under Fred's power, but it got real old after that.
This is a great film! Two severed thumbs up!",Freddy vs. Jason
430,johnsaucier1977,it was actually good,8,23 August 2003,"This was a decent movie, which I didn't expect. I'd actually like to see another one. I think the actors with the exception of Robert Englund were terrible, but no one expected this to be an oscar contender. If you went into this movie expecting to see a hack and slash then you are going to see a good movie.",Freddy vs. Jason
431,nevsky41,Fulfilled on premise!,8,18 August 2003,"The whole point of this movie was to be able to see Freddy and Jason beat the ever-loving snot out of each other, and we got to see that.  I was a bit disappointed that Kane Hodder wasn't playing Jason this time out, but hey, you can't have everything.  I won't reveal any spoilers, but the ending wasn't quite what I was expecting.  Not bad, just, a surprise. Some people have said Jason is just a wimpy mamma's boy, well, I don't see it that way. I see him more as an unstoppable force of nature that you can only hide away for so long before he must be set free again.  Freddy is a more sadistic character than Jason for me, because Jason just kills efficiently and brutally.  Freddy is more psychological, but takes a really long time to kill people.  Only the Puppet Master puppets and Pinhead take as long to kill people as Freddy.  It may be more entertaining when Freddy kills a character, but Jason just does the deed, does it fast and moves on. I recommend this to any Freddy or Jason fan, but don't expect them to settle their issues over a cup of tea!",Freddy vs. Jason
432,devstk,Finally!,8,16 August 2003,"A movie that has been talked about since, well, at least 15 years i imagine. The two heavy weights from horror movie fame from the 80's finally meet. It had poor acting from the ""local"" police, but in these types of movies, you'd expect that.  The whole premise was done well, i thought.  The retelling of how Freddy started, and Jason drowning was helpful to those too young to remember the first few stories.  The use of Jason's Mom was great!The action of the movie on whole was fast-paced and really quite scary, at times.  Not ""scream and leave"" type of scary, but it had it's moments. The fight scenes between the two were done to perfection.  Freddy had his ups, with his usual comic one-liners.  Jason, too had his winning moments, with the never say die attitude.With the way these movies have been produced in the recent past, it was nice to see this one.  It had all the right main characters and the right feel to it.  Go see this film ... it will bring you back to the days of 80's Horror when Jason and Freddy had their say in how to kill.  Enjoy campers!",Freddy vs. Jason
433,cammyabechter,Good scary movie,9,3 August 2020,"If you haven't seen this movie, but you're a fan of horror, I highly recommend seeing it. It is not stupid or cheesy as some might think and then not see It. It is thrilling and scary and a classic.",Freddy vs. Jason
434,rayw-4,"Gore, fights and plenty of laughs",7,1 February 2004,"I'll admit, I didn't expect much from the pairing of these two very tired franchises. Having only liked a couple in each of the series, there didn't seem to be a point in embarrassing both of them even further. I mean really, how do you make the burned boogeyman turned standup comic scary again? For that matter, how do you associate the masked mongloid that was never really scary with the creepiness factor? The simple answer: DON'T FRICKIN' WORRY ABOUT IT!The creators of FREDDY VS. JASON wisely guide the film toward its initial goals of gore, fights and plenty of laughs. Sure, there are scenes that don't quite work (the 'Freddypillar' and the final wink come to mind), and it has a somewhat slow beginning, but the majority of it is, at least, never boring.**7/10**      An entertaining movie that sets out to do what it              promises.",Freddy vs. Jason
435,jescho13,"'wink,wink' ;)",4,14 August 2003,"Freddy vs. Jason is another example of the ""new horror"" film. Don't take yourself too seriously and be sure to follow the ""rules"" set forth in previous horror films. It's always been known that sex and drugs kills in horror movies, but since Scream verbalized these rules, most of the following horror movies have followed the Scream template of self parody. It's as if after every kill the murderer turns to the camera and gives and big wink. (If you've seen Freddy vs. Jason, you know what I mean when I talk about winking to the camera.) Making fun of horror movies cliches in modern horror films is becoming cliche in itself. This new post-modern mentality in making horror films is ruining them. I enjoyed the film Wrong Turn more than Freddy vs. Jason, but it too is guilty of the same crime. House of 1000 Corpses was supposed to be the return to the glory days of horror, but it was just the abortion that resulted in all of the other slasher movie icons getting together and having a big orgy. The makers of Freddy vs. Jason feel they have to spoon feed us by using abrupt and illogical exposition, which seems to be about a quarter of the movie. Having waited so long for this movie, it's a huge disappointment for it to be so bad. Horror movies have turned into 90 minute music videos with the slashers being cartoons of themselves from their reign in the 80s.",Freddy vs. Jason

That was great. The actors were okay, a little more characterization would be good except for Freddy and Jason.The claustrophobic sets were very good. The problem, with this film is that it is too slashy, not suspenseful.

meanwhile, while jason is dreaming of killing teans in his grave, freddy comes out disguised as jason's mom. he tells jason to go kill the teens on elm street, and MAKE THEM REMEMBER WHAT FEAR TASTES LIKE! anywho, jason goes to elm street and makes several gruesome, gruesome, murders. are afriad that it is freddy, and begin to worry. but after jason keeps on killing freddy's kids on elm street, freddy is richously p***ed. so, they duke it out on elm street, then the kids bring jason back to crystal lake, to kill freddy. the only thing i was p***ed about, was jason kept getting his ass kicked by freddy throughout the movie, but besides that, jason and freddy made sure of dispatching those naughty teens who were having sex, doing drugs, and so on, and so on. i just cannot wait to get this flick on DVD",Freddy vs. Jason

This is so much better than the Scream/I know what you dids of late.  Not stop Kills, action, and most of all BREASTS in a horror film. Havent seen those in a while.
I really think Horror is making a comeback now [I'm a horror fan so to me it never went out] with Jeepers Creepers 2, Underworld, Cabin Fever and 28 Days later. I even had my doubts about The new TCM, but after seeing the trailer before Freddy vs Jason, I change my mind.I'm glad there is violence, blood and guts [NON- PG-13] for the rest of us that like that stuff. I'm Glad Freddy slammed should I say SWAT'ed] Colin Farrel's candy-ass down a couple of notches and delivered a death blow to Ben and J-Lo's Gigli.But seriously go see this movie, it is very entertaining and the script is laugh out loud funny.

441,Steal-No-Evol,A Very Special Freddy's Nightmares- guest staring Jason,9,14 August 2003,"I saw Freddy vs Jason late Wednesday night and was waiting to watch it the whole day... this movie has been _10_ years in the making for me, and I'm only 20 years old.Well, to start, I'm not a huge Freddy or Nightmare on Elm Street fan but I have loved Jason and the Friday the 13th movies for a long time. This movie had to live up to some kind of expectation of mine.And it did.I thought Freddy was better here than most of the Elm Streets, and it was almost like he was hosting/narrating a Very Special Episode of Freddy's Nightmares. He still had humor to his character but really acted more like a personified demon, which I really enjoyed. Freddy was twisted just enough for his humor to be disturbing and not so flash-80s. Freddy gets an ""A""Jason though, was shown to be a little puny kid when he was a young camper at Crystal Lake that somehow 'cannot die' so I guess forget all the worm-demon crap from Jason Goes To Hell and stick with him being a wussy child from Part 8. Jason does have feelings--they're just very hard to get to--and he is afraid of things, like water. This Jason-who-has-a-heart should have been gone after Part 4. Although this picture does give credit to the rest of the Friday the 13th series which was really nice, Jason gets a ""B+""Now, the rest of the cast I thought was a little lame. No one gets much higher than a solid ""B"" grade, with a few scenes with the teens getting ""C""s and ""D""s. I did not like Kelly Rowland and when she talks with Freddy it's very lame for about fifteen seconds. The two main characters were OK at very best. I liked how the cops fit perfect in either the Friday or Nightmare movies and they served their purpose perfectly.Over all, you know the names and you know the movie. The ending is not horrible, but the scene leading up to the end is about one hundred times over-melodramatic and plenty of average movie goers might let out a big laugh or groan. Was this worth waiting ten years? I'm just glad I didn't have to wait any longer!May your disappointments be damned!",Freddy vs. Jason
442,Darkness876,A strong entry into both series.,6,6 September 2003,"Dracula and Wolfman's duel had everyone on the edge of there seat back in 1935. Sixty-five years later the slashers of the current generation duke it out in this bloodbath which intertwines the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street films. The film begins as a common slasher flick when Jason is resurrected to strike fear into the teenagers of Elm Street in an attempt to restore power to Freddy, who has been forgotten and trapped in hell. Jason does his job well disposing the half wit protagonists and then for the last thirty minutes dukes it out with Freddy both in the dream and real world. The film delivers what fans would expect and then some and was surprisingly entertaining for its thin plot. The kills are all in the goriest fashion and a great performance is given by Jason Ritter as Will a young adult who escapes his Asylum to save his girlfriend. I would recommend this film for fans of both series but not for those new to them. The film reveals a lot about previous films which only hardcore fans would appreciate while not being strong enought to be a stand alone film. My rating is 3.5 stars out of 5",Freddy vs. Jason

444,ciaranmcloughlin-34838,The best crossover movie in my opinion.,7,2 November 2017,"I enjoyed this movie a lot more than Alien vs Predator, regardless of what you think of it. It really does both of the characters justice. It is a lot of fun. If you came for the title, it is more than happy to deliver. If you love A Nightmare on Elm Street & Friday the 13th and want a crossover, This is just about as good as you're probably gonna get.Freddy is dead, and is trying to reclaim his existence from fear of the teenagers of Elm Street. However, people are trying to avoid remembering Freddy in case he comes back. They clear all records of Freddy to avoid spreading information about him. They quarantine the teenagers who have heard of Freddy to avoid spreading the fear. They prohibit even mentioning his name. Freddy then decides to resurrect Jason in a dream sequence, telling him his work is not yet finished. Jason comes back to life and starts murdering teenagers in Elm Street for him in order to bring back the fear of Freddy Krueger. Unfortunately for Freddy, Jason takes his victims out of Freddy's reach. Freddy begins to regret his plan and proceeds to take Jason on mono e mono. Lori (one of the teenagers) has a personal vendetta against Freddy as he is responsible for her mother's death and interferes with the fight.What I like about the film is the fight scenes are well done, the camera doesn't shake around too much. I like how in the dream sequences Freddy gets the upper hand and in reality Jason becomes more dominant. It brings a sense of levity between the two. There is genuine fright value and it's a good choice for Halloween. It gives you bang for your buck.While there are enjoyable aspects of this movie, it wasn't perfect. The acting is weak and the characters are a bit one dimensional. The nudity was gratuitous. The subplot of Lori seeking revenge against Freddy was kind of silly. The story is very basic and not very deep. If you are looking for a lot of substance, or something with a philosophical message, or artistic merits, this movie is not for you.Overall, Freddy vs Jason is far from a masterpiece, but it's a fun film if you enjoy horror and action. It's definitely not for everyone.",Freddy vs. Jason
445,jakeben,As good as a crossover movie can be!,6,10 June 2020,As a huge fan of the Friday the 13th franchise and the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise when I first heard of this I didn't want to watch the movie because I usually hate all these crossover movies made for money alone which are usually terrible in my opinion! When I finally watched it I definitely thought it was a lot better than I had expected all things considered. Obviously the special effects are all great and all that but there is an Ok story to it with some really great set pieces as big budget horror movies go. Characters aren't the best which I suppose would be expecting too much from a movie like this. What you'd expect in the line of characters just there to be fodder some of them a bit OTT in the obnoxious department towards their girlfriend who looks like a supermodel etc. Definitely worth the watch if you love both the biggest franchises in horror or at least 2 of the biggest 3 the third being Halloween of course! A good 6/10 for entertainment value from someone who doesn't usually like the crossover genre!,Freddy vs. Jason
446,jtbenson-56329,This Movie Was Written by Korn,1,18 September 2021,"Jason X came out when I was in middle school and I stayed the hell away from it - the ads for it had me convinced that it was birthed from the cringe factory of late-90's / early 2000's nu-metal culture. I was wrong. That movie is downright enjoyable. Unique kills, David Cronenberg, some witty humor derived from the enduring tropes of the series.This right here, Freddy vs. Jason, is the movie I should've worried about. The two villains tear through kills, spilling copious amounts of CGI blood in completely unremarkable fashion - paralleling the homogenized edge-lord bullcrap we got from the music of that era.The teenagers trade awkward barbs that I'm positive would've gotten me made-fun-of at my high school. Freddy hammers his favorite curse word and the whole film stops like they're doing the audience a favor.

I didn't expect Freddy to go for it so physically! Knees! Kicks! Elbows! The cast of teenagers could have been done a bit better, more outrageousness needed to make this a timeless classic.Coming from the halls of Lean Viewing, however, I would call this one Pretty Fantastic.

The 80's slasher fiends combined in one movie, it could go two ways; very good or very bad. Luckily for us it's the former :) wahey.Before you even think about watching this, do not go into the cinema expecting top grade film-making, verging on masterpiece. For if you do, you are very naive and have probably never seen any of the previous NOES or Fridays. If you go in, like i'm sure 99% of you will, expecting a welcome return to slasher hell sporting two of the greatest in the genre, you will come out satisfied and aching for more next year. This film sticks two fingers up at 'Scream' and the horde of wannabes that followed and shouts 'This is how a slasher is done'. Gone are the annoying little twists, back are the 'Yeh i know whats gonna happen' storylines....thank phuq.So the plot is this (yes there actually is one), Freddy and Jason are gone and forgotten. The world is free of razor fingers and machettes and life is apparently all fine and dandy. However in hell, Freddy is not such a happy chappy as he wants to kill more and more, but can't. He can't because the people of Springwood have purposely forgotten him. If nobody remembers him he can't come back in their dreams. The remaining kids who do remember him are locked up in a shrink unit with no contact to the outside world, in order to contain his legend. Freddy come up with a devious plan of sending Jason back up to earth, by posing as his mother and ordering him to go to Elm Street to kill in order to try and make people remember who Freddy is. After Jason makes his firts kill in the house Nancy fought Freddy in NOES1, a connection is made and the memories start flooding back. Things start looking up for Freddy, but good things never last as you will eventually see.I'll give it to em, this is a good film. A plot that doesn't seem too stupid, a cast that is well typical of this genre and an atmosphere that suits this film brillianty make this a highly worthy watch.Freddy is more evil than in any of his other films in my opinion. His charachter is and always will remain the best is the original, but this contains a excellent portrayal of him. Jason on the other hand, is a weaker charchter in this one. Ok so he was never a stand out charachter anyways, but damn it...Kane Hodder was the best.anyways good film, great to see Freddy back and esp fighting Jason :)9/10and there was me expecting a pile of crap!!! lol",Freddy vs. Jason

With Freddy's quick wit and Jason's hockey mask you are brought back to the time when bad slasher films still had class.  In this movie they did not worry about the science of the human body or how the police would react to a killer in real life.  The movie has its moments of fright where you jump and then laugh at yourself for doing it.  Holes in the plot are plenty.

When you consider 3 things, 1st there have been 10 Jason Movies and 7 Freddy movies, the well is run pretty dry on these ideas. 2nd most of these movies have been bombs and 3rd is it very hard to write a script where the two main characters are serial killers. When you factor all this in, it really is a good script, of course it would have been better with Kane Hodder in it. The story did a good job of creating conflict between Freddy & Jason.

Freddy fights quite realistically and effectively with his hands against Jason even though it would be difficult for one to actually imagine how that would'nt seem ridiculous? You have to see it to believe it. This is very much the same Freddy from the past. And so is Jason. Then of course, there's plenty of blood and gore. The story and plot themselves are not bad. Honestly, this movie actually is good and worth watching, at least to see Jason and Freddy take on each quite realistically.",Freddy vs. Jason
458,scipio23,Very Good,8,11 August 2003,"Just saw the premiere in Austin and it was worth it.  It will more than satisfy Jason and Freddy fans.  Ken Kerzinger does fine wearing the hockey mask, and Freddy is as good as ever.  A movie which could have been very disappointing has turned out to be a great addition to both series.",Freddy vs. Jason
459,Fanofmovs,2 Great Horror Gods + 1 Amazing Horror Movie = FvsJ.,10,27 August 2003,"I have been a big movieholic all my life, and horror is one of my favorite genres. I grow up seeing the Freddy's saga and Jason's saga, and love both of them. =) The only movie i didn't saw of both sagas was Jason goes to Hell, and so i didn't know about Freddy grabbing the Jason's mask in the end of that movie. And consequently, didn't know New Line was bringing both horror icons to a showdown...it's was only a couple of years ago that i first discovered about the fight between them they were preparing. Then, my heart giggled with excitement and so i waited. Well, the wait is over and the result is a ""nightmarish + campy + bloody + hell + amazing + horror + mov"" that has all the fine sliced ingredients that it needs to have on the furnace: naked teens, teens partying and using dope and alcohol as if it was the end of the World, gore painting the screen, a great and creative story, over-the-top and perfect special-effects, extraordinary use of lights and shadows and colors through out the visuals of it, beautiful action sequences in 2 classic environments (Camp Crystal Lake and Elm Street!) melted in 2 realities (Reality and Dream World!), funny liners and good dialogue, excellent editing, great direction, outstanding finale, etc etc. And more important: having F Krueger and J Voorhees on the same movie!!! :) The critic's reviews hack and slash FvsJ big time, not sparing the bad reviews. But when i read audience's and fan's reviews i notice that i'm not the only one that considers FvsJ a fantastic film. Not only as a horror mov but as a movie too. Freddy fear not. You or Jason aren't going to be forgotten by the Elm Street's kids and Camp Crystal Lake's kids, and nor by us. ;) ""Go Freddy. Go Jason."" :D",Freddy vs. Jason
460,Brie9,don't know what anyone saw in it,1,3 August 2007,"Absolutely awful is about the extent of what I can say about this movie. I've never been a strong Friday the 13th fan, but have been a Nightmare on Elm Street fan. I am also a horror, slasher movie fan even of the really B-grade productions with limited special effects etc. I simply enjoy the suspense, the camaraderie among characters usually set up before any horrors occur and many other typical attributes of the movie genre however this piece was totally lacking in everything. The image and production quality appeared poor, sets looked simple, the scenes dark and not well lit or defined. There was no characterization period, no build up to characters or their connections or ability to care for them as characters. The villains in Jason and Freddy are not explained well at all. Given most people interested in this movie would be fans of the series however there could be a reasonable means to work a history of the villains and their horrors into the weave of the story. The concepts of how they both come to terrorize the community in the story, why, and how and why Freddy and Jason become embroiled in a grudge match is not clear either. A dog that you watch believing it has to get better because the original movies with these characters were excellent, but it never did get better.",Freddy vs. Jason
461,jessemaddox@charter.net,Freddy Vs. Jason=Dracula Vs. Frankenstein,8,16 August 2003,"I must admit my review is biased because I love horror films.  All in all, the film was pretty entertaining.  Although this has been done before with the 1930 monsters (in very similar fashion), the special effects and general, relative longevity of the current creeps made this one a good deal better.  The film delivered only a few ""spooky"" moments (i.e., a few dream sequences), but made up for it by letting the two heavyweights slug it out for a solid fifteen to twenty minutes.  The rest of the supporting cast was annoying.  There was the typical, gratuitous sex stuff, drug use, and teens behaving badly.  But Ken Kirzinger's hulking, silent performance and Robert Englund's surprisingly energetic role are enough to make this film worth seeing for any horror fan.  If you don't expect much, you will like the movie.  If you are expecting something a little more in depth and creative, I think 28 Days is still playing in some places.... And I don't care what anyone says- Mike Myers still rules!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
462,VWaltz77,Surprisingly Deep Story (possible spoilers),6,17 August 2003,"I went into seeing this movie with the expectations that it would be like the rest - just a bunch of sex-crazed teens getting killed in innovative & grisly ways. This expectation was fine; I grew up a fan of slasher flicks. Although this expectation was met, I was also very impressed.This movie was the most well-written film in either the Freddy or Jason series. The story was surprisingly deep in that the psyche of the Freddy & Jason characters were really explained; audiences have a unique opportunity to see the hated murderers in a much different light.Actually going back to see where their characters came from was very interesting. I found myself sympathizing with Jason, as well as having such appreciation for Freddy!I don't dare compare this to 'The Silence of the Lambs' or 'The Shining' saying it's among the greatest horror/thriller flicks of all time, but this certainly surprised me as I really got my money's worth.Of course, the humor, drug use, sex, gory murders, etc. were fun to see too!Bottom line: Entertaining & fun, a good flick to see with friends... 7/10",Freddy vs. Jason
463,Filmmaker84,Thanks for bringing back Freddy,9,25 August 2003,"I saw this film on opening night in a crowded audience of F13 and NOES fans and the entrie theatre was filled with the raging antcipation. It was probably one of the best expiernces I ever had seeing a movie.  I just thought I would get that out of the way for a moment.(spoliers, but nothing TOO major) I really liked this film and I liked the structure of this film. It starts as F13 movie "" We're stupid kids doing stupid things, lets have sex and drink""     then is starts to have hints of a nightmare movie when talks of conspiracies are brought up.  But then it jumps back to f13 movie where they want to party and there is a big blood bath of victims.     The film then takes a full on NOES twist as the characters know they are trapped in the lies of the adults, and must fight for them selves.  Then film gradually makes it's way into ""freddy vs.jason""  which I think is the perfect way to go and was structured very well. As far as the acting Jason Ritter, Kelly Rowland, Katherine Isabelle ( I hate to admit it, OH I hate her) and a few others did really well.  Now of course there was some over acting, but you can't blame the actors for that. Apperenly Ronny Yu told them to make there own characters, that he was totally involved in the look and that it was thier job not his.  Granted that is true, and something a lot of actors would strive for.  But come on, they are kids.  25?  You let a 25 yo take control of the entire performance and you Overdramatic acting. It happens,  so that cast can't be totally faulted. My Big beef is that (SPOLIER) Freddy kills ONE person.  He doesn't even seem to enjoy it that much, when you consider he was longing for a kill. Personally I think he should have killed Kia, thats just me tho.A side note,  This, and CHICAGO, are the only films I have ever scene where the audience applauded during and after the movie.  And I don't mean little claps by random people.  The ENTIRE audience burst into applause at one point.  So if that says something.I don't know that's just my humble opinion.",Freddy vs. Jason
464,CrzyMuthaRugger,good movie,10,11 November 2003,"Freddy vs Jason is an awesome movie. If you love the Friday the 13th/ Nightmare on Elm Street movies, you will definitely love this movie. The fight scenes are excellent. The acting is that typical of the a Friday the 13th movies, which makes it even better. Could you imagine good acting in one of those movies? It doesn't make sense. I cannot wait for the DVD. It is going to be packed with bonus features. I also cannot wait for the next installment of Freddy vs. Jason, it will be equally entertaining.",Freddy vs. Jason
465,danielmeakin,Evil Versus Evil!!!!!,6,4 February 2004,"Now, roughly to sum up the film, theres a few clever writing plots, i honestly wonder how long it took them to think of how to get Freddy back from hell, well, i suppose its better than lightning hitting Jason, (Part6) The acting from the ""other characters"" is pretty dull, but lets face it, if they put in an oscar winning performance, it kinda takes the limelight off of Englund and Kirzinger. It's a slick enjoyable slasher flick, and is the best slasher flick probably since Nightmare3, but that is my opinion. For people not into the genre, im not sure as to whether it might get them into it. Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger have had a bit of live breathed into them again, and lets face it, in Jasons case after jason x it was sorely needed!",Freddy vs. Jason
466,deadbodieseverywhere17,A decent slasher,8,23 August 2004,"Yah, Yah, Yah, another movie in the long lines of the eighties-nineties horror films. Well watch this movie before you judge. I am a huge Freddy Krueger fan and a decent Jason fan and this movie was everything you could want from them. You have your classic naked girl by the lake getting slashed and your eighties slasher music (original music from both series which made it more classic). Robert Englund brings out the red and green sweater (which Kelly Rowland's character Kia comments on), and the Fedora to try and kill some more stupid Elm st. kids. Resurrects Jason to put the fear in them and then can't stop big J. Long story short Ronny yu did an amazing job especially bringing them back to Crystal lake which is Jason's home base. Only thing I couldn't figure out was that Jason walked to Elm st. and it was a short drive back to Crystal lake, so how come nobody in Spingwood (Freddy's hometown) knew about Jason until officer Stubbs (Monroe) researched him?? Oh well, hopefully a part 2 will answer some questions.",Freddy vs. Jason

468,RobZombie01930,Enjoyable.,8,26 May 2005,"Let me say this right now: This movie is not a thinker. It's not very intelligent, and its not thought provoking. But it's one hell of a thrill ride, and in and itself, got some creepy moments.Some people may be disappointed, but to tell you the truth, this movie does exactly what I wanted it to do--give the viewer a good time. This is a nice enjoyable film, plenty of action/gore/nudity for everyone, and its awesome to see the old monsters back into the action.I give this movie a fun and enjoyable 8/10. Good job Hollywood, you pulled off a movie thats **gasp** enjoyable! However, though, this movie may not be for the faint of heart. Plenty of gore, plenty of nudity, and plenty of sexuality. But for people like me, the movie suits just fine.Also, oddly, the actor for Jason was changed but it's not really noticeable. Again, a nice 8/10 from me. goodjob, Hollywood.",Freddy vs. Jason
469,Blackhawk1989,What more could we ask for?,8,29 October 2013,"The ending of 'Jason Lives' promised us that the iconic Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krugger would one day cross paths. After years of rewrites, stalled productions and studio politics, we finally got 'Freddy vs Jason', and it was everything it needed to be.The plot of course is nothing special. Think of this as a Nightmare on Elm Street film with a guest appearance by Jason. Freddy has grown weak, and dupes Jason into heading to Elm Street to put fear back into the hearts of teens. Eventually the two rub each other the wrong way and it's time for arms to be ripped off and sharped gloves to gouge eyes. It's a set-up, but one that serves its purpose, and actually offers more than the typical Jason movie. In a rare case for a crossover movie it would have suffered if you swapped Jason out for 'generic slasher'.The cast are the typical line up of victims, but thankfully no-one ever gazes into the camera and quotes another film like 'Scream' would have done. Robert Englund is great as Freddy (as always), and Ken Kirzinger makes for a great lumbering Jason. Some may have preferred Kane Hodder, but Ken is clearly having a blast wielding the machete.The film is also directed better than your average slasher. The careful use of colour tint, two excellently staged battles and a superb party massacre are all a blast to watch. Considering the studio could have handed this to anyone and made a profit it's a pleasant surprise.So if your a fan of either of the two characters check this out. If your not, you'll lose out on most of the fun, but it's still great to see a burnt man with knives for fingers battling an undead titan. Switch your brain off and enjoy this roller coaster of a film",Freddy vs. Jason

Jason time to keep me satisfied, but it's a bit one sided don't you think? I kept score at home (Im a NERDlol) and Jason PWNED when it came to kills. Freddy killed one person directly, while Jason had himself a bloodbath. I do acknowledge that Freddy indirectly killed some people and fought great for a guy in his position, but COME ON! Heres my main problem with the movie: IT Ain't A MATCH! You've got Jason a super strong killing machine, that's ALL HE DOES! Then there's Freddy, hes scrawny in comparison and doesn't kill people off the bat like Jason. Freddy likes to play with his food. You can see the obvious problem. The match I wanna see is Michael V.S. Jason. Two killing machines who don't mess around. Plus, Michael can take a punch from Jason. We're talking about two huge guys! That would be an even match up. And this is coming from a huge fan of Freddy! Freddy is just better when he can take his time to play mind games and kill horrifically! Freddy needs a new movie.

It is pretty entertaining, well at least the end is, but the rest of the movie didn't really hold my interest.  The plot seems like it's barely held together by tape and the acting isn't all that good either, but the fight at the end makes it all worth watching.  I do think this movie could've been better if they spent a little more time with the story (I'm not exaggerating when I say the plot is thin.  Hell, it's anorexic.), but it's still great to see Jason and Freddy literally at each other's throats. Maybe for a sequel we'll get to see the winner take on Michael Myers.",Freddy vs. Jason

480,magx01,A Small Review and A Favour To Ask,5,15 August 2003,"Since anyone reading this is probably aware of the story and how this movie came to be, I will just skip straight to the things you want to hear. This movie rocks. Yes there are a couple of cheesy things here and there that make you shake your head, but you do so with a smile on your face. Yes, Freddy has a few one-liners, and one that fits the cheesy mold. However, Freddy is much more menacing than he is in most of the other movies, and he gets downright evil at some points in the movie. His lines in the beginning especially are very chilling. Jason is as ruthless as ever, and he has some awesome kills. There is a lot of blood, and a good amount of gore to boot. The kills, for the most part, are very creative, and cool. The movie maintains a steady pace throughout. The dream sequences will chill you to the bone. There are a LOT of kills in this movie, and some excellent moments where the suspense is almost too much to bear. This movie provides a lot of laughs as well. We all laughed quite a few times during this movie.AND THE FIGHT!!!! Well, its long, but intercut with some interesting dream sequences and backstory, which keeps it from going stale. The ways they try to kill each other are awesome. Freddy especially. Lots of funny moments, and even a few where you can't help but almost sympathise with the characters. Great great great!!!!!The movie runs about 1h 40 min, and its rated R for violence, gore, nudity, sexuality, language, and drug use.Now I ask of you all a favour: Go See This Movie!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
481,DarkReflection,Trash... A total disappointment,1,24 August 2003,"After 10 years, the horror world finally gets the movie it was promised... Freddy vs. Jason. But it definitely does NOT live up to the hype... The script is incredibly stupid, and the set up to get them together seems thrown-together and comes off as idiotic. The opening scene is a throwback to the old days of Friday the 13th with blood, breasts, and running through the forest. Unfortunately, it goes down from there, with some of the most irritating plotting ever committed to film and the most sleep-inducing scare sequences ever. The gore is alright, with plenty of shots of the teenager's fake squirting blood (and the incredibly fake CGI) cut so thin it's almost subliminal. Of course, it's alright to see the villains get hacked up, so the final battle is nice n bloody. Speaking of CGI, did I mention that it's absolutely overused here? There's even static shot of Jason's mask that's computer generated. The ""shadow of Freddy"" sequence looked incredibly fake and laughable, and the CGI gore is annoyingly phoney. There's more, even stuff you wouldn't expect to be CGI has become CGI... Inane overuse of technology that should be used sparingly. As I said, the last 15 minutes are tolerable, but the boring buildup has not nearly enough suspense, violence, or entertainment... The director did a bang up job with interesting angles and shot setups (even though the slow-mo was overused), but the movie is so horrible it's hard to appreciate the directorial merits. Too many fake kills and horrible scripting. Up until the final battle, it's an endurance test to stay awake. Avoid it. Don't let the producer's make another one.",Freddy vs. Jason

Back to the 80's style slasher films, this brought Freddy back to his old glory, and Jason just kicked some major ass.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't one of the best horror movies ever made, certainly not better than the original Elm Street or Friday the 13th (part IV is my personal favorite), but Freddy & Jason both got so cheesed out over the years that it was awesome to be a little creeped out by them again.  Freddy actually looked evil!!!  The only disappointment I have is that I read an interview with the director, and he said there would be a clear cut winner, but there was not.

Film critics rarely enjoy horror movies and tear them to shreds whenever they are released, the only horror films worth anything to a critic are The Exorcist, The Shining, and other such classics.But if you're like the majority of people who are only looking for some entertainment and not a moving-cinematic masterpiece then Freddy vs. Jason may be just what you're looking for.

The plot of the movie is thin, all the clichés are present (Freddy's stupid one-liners and Jason's reluctance to die) Chicks, gore and those annoying scenes where they try hard to make it funny.

487,tvshankar,Did Jason Win? Did Freddy Lose?,6,2 January 2005,"Did Jason win? Did Freddy lose? That's the question. Frankly speaking, we don't know whether there was a win and lose situation when speaking about 'Freddy Vs Jason' (2003), directed by Ronny Yu and starring Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger as Freddy and Jason respectively.After nearly ten years in exile from the cinema, Freddy is revitalized in this slasher flick, which provides chills and plenty of bloodletting action!! Robert Englund, who has played the razor-fingered antihero in all the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' movies since 1984, as usual brings the one-liners and humor with his portrayal in this film in a fresh spirit that has made the character of Freddy Kruger fascinating! Jason Voorhees, in more ways than one, is far more scary and dangerous than what Freddy can be! In Freddy's case, you can see what he looks like directly and with his constant one-liners, you lose the sense of fear for him but rather some amusement! In Jason's case, it's the opposite. We cannot see what Jason really looks like, since he hides it behind a hockey mask, so naturally we are more afraid of him because we have no idea what he looks like! Kane Hodder was a impressively frightening Jason in the four 'Friday the 13ths' leading up to 'Jason X' in 2002, and there's not a shadow of doubt that he would have done the same in 'Freddy Vs Jason', but he was unfortunately replaced by Ken Kirzinger, who seemed more apt for the role of the silent machete-wielding monster on the basis of his great stature. Nevertheless Ken gave a really spine chilling edge to the character of Jason Voorhees, and there stands no distinction between him and Kane's Jason.In this movie, Freddy is desperate at terrorizing teenagers in their dreams, since the kids of Elm Street have been made to forget him completely with dream suppressants. Freddy then resurrects Jason to terrorize the kids at Elm Street in order for him to unleash his worst in teenagers' dreams. However, Jason goes overboard with the killing, and when Jason kills the girl that Freddy was about to kill himself, the seed of hatred is planted between the ultra-tyrants! The fighting between Freddy and Jason in Freddy's dream world and then subsequently at Camp Crystal Lake is exciting and thrilling, for you want to know who's going to win in this terrible fight. Of course at the end it is Jason who has more or less won, since you see him carrying Freddy's head like some trophy at the end of the film, but did he really win on his own is not the case for he was helped by the Elm Street kids who were trying to get the big, silent fiend against their arch nemesis, Freddy, which shows that Freddy could have defeated Jason in his dream world, but who was unfortunately dragged to the real world by Lori (Monica Keena) where Jason had some chance of defeating him in the ultimate fight. So overall, the fight was a draw! I wonder whether Freddy will win when the sequel to 'Freddy Vs Jason' comes this year or in 2006?",Freddy vs. Jason

Cringe worthy dialogue – characters feel the need to reiterate the plot of the movie every twenty minutes. Bad acting – I'm looking at you, Kelly Rowland.

Freddy is Freddy and he has his wisecracks intact, and Jason is still the strong and silent type.

However, a kid 5 year old watching the original Nightmare on Elm Street isn't always the best idea, as many a sleepless night started to occur. It's a story often told by my Mum. Anyway, ever since then, I've been a fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. It was inevitable that I'd come across Friday the 13th sooner then later and also became a fan of that too. None of them are scary when you look back, apart from, in my opinion the original Nightmare and that's why in 2003 I decided to go back to my childhood and go to see Freddy Vs Jason with a few pals. We all came out of the cinema happy as sand boys. We were all aware that it wasn't going to shock or scare us, but we didn't expect to laugh either. Fact is, any horror fans will probably píss and moan because it's not scary and there are some dodgy moments, but for a mindless slash-fest with laughs mixed in, tits bouncing and Freddy's one liners, you really can't ask for more.",Freddy vs. Jason

Youthful cast, those famous monsters of the 1980s (yes, I'm talking about both of you, Freddy and Jason), and a rocking soundtrack. What more can I say? Even skateboarder Bam Margera would put the bands that made those songs at the end credits on his favorites list besides HIM and 69Eyes! II. I was afraid this was going to happen: Monica Keena's last line in the film (sends chills down my spine and weird dreams by the time that's over): This I had to give one star out of ten. Lori's screaming throughout the movie, Kia (Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child, one of my favorite R&B bands) taunting Jason before getting sent flying halfway across the screen, Super Smash Bros. Melee style, and then crashing into a tree after Jason slashes her, and both Freddy (Robert Englund) and Jason (Ken Kirshner) falling into a lake after Shannon Rutherford-influenced spoiled brat Lori (Monica Keena) smacks Freddy with Jason's machete are some of the reasons people might want to watch this. Only two of the four things I mentioned above are the flaws I found. Like Saw, some of the characters don't act--they scream. Lori did that about 6 to 8 times throughout the film. Whenever I watch this, I keep thinking about Lori's last line, and my imagination runs wild, thinking all the horror movie fans would be upset and terrified (as the joke would be on them), as the cast of Laguna Beach was out to get them because they were on Monica Keena's side. So I tell myself that it's just a movie. Monica Keena should have had a better way of saying that last line instead of being seductive, offensive, and swearing. Otherwise, this Freddy/Jason incarnation is perfect.This review is not to say that Monica Keena was the only thing good about this movie. Now the screaming I didn't find the problem. That was 20% of what I didn't like about this movie. 30% was the intense gore left on the victims of Jason and/or Freddy. 50% was the Monica Keena fiasco explained above. III. Lori, Part 2: This review is also NOT to express hatred towards Monica Keena, either, as I cannot degrade an actress in any reviews. That's simply against my will. What I will say is that she was a lukewarm choice to play Lori. Not that great, but could be capable of better. The fans should have loved it when Freddy taunted her in one of her flashbacks, though. That was one of the chilling moments.IV. My final thoughts: Well, what can I say? Critics everywhere are trashing Robert Englund and Ken Kirshner's movies, but there are some fellow movie fans at the Internet Movie Database that don't care about them and say that they liked the film. I couldn't agree more. I can imagine many Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees fans upset that Monica Keena killed their favorite villains. Some people watching this could be taunting them saying that ""they got beat by a girl"", which I automatically call a Personal Foul and a Coach's Challenge. But that never comes true. Oh well. Freddy vs. Jason is not for the faint of heart, and you couldn't agree more. It's not recommended for the squeamish, and only the strong survive when watching movies like this.",Freddy vs. Jason
492,viviewages,Pretty good stupid fun movie.,6,23 May 2007,"I thought it was a great movie but had a terrible cast, the acting was terrible, but that doesn't really matter for a horror movie. This movie has the best two characters side-by-side (freddy and Jason), which is why I liked it, ironically we cheer on the serial killers, why? well, because they light up the screen with terrific acting and suspense-we actually feel happiness when we see a unique way of severing or death of a victim. The fight scenes were well done, but I wanted more, they should have fought in several different areas, which would have been more interesting, because really we don't care for the ""kids"", let them die! We just want Kruegar and Voorhees! Well I wanted to see Freddy and Jason just like they were in the 17 movies, and that's what was delivered. Sure the acting is terrible, and there are plot issues, but I think they did a great job with this interesting concept, it's unique and fun. But if you are too uptight about movies, then maybe you should pass on this one, because every ""Scream"" stereotype is used. I think if they had completely changed the cast of the kids I would have appreciated this movie more than I do now.",Freddy vs. Jason
493,Fred-86,Freddy Vs. Jason or: Why Horror Films Have A Bad Name,1,10 September 2003,"You would think that a movie in planning for 10+ years would be tremendously better than this film is, but no. New Line went and put another nail in the horror genre's coffin (no pun intended). This film not only bastardizes both series, but horror in general. The director, Ronny Yu, apparently has no concept of ""directing"" and seemingly has no knowledge of these two franchises. The story goes from completely unoriginal to absolutely hokey. Acting is the worst in any film I have ever seen, non-professional included. One scene that is truly appalling is when Jason goes on an ultra-psycho rampage (more than usual) and begins slaughtering unobtrusive teenagers right and left. I know this is a horror film, but it is totally disturbing and there is no reason for it. I suppose the producer's felt the only way to save the film was to pour onto the audience a never-ending flood of blood and gore. And boy does it keep coming and coming and coming. After it's all said and done this film is the worst of the worst to be released in a long, long time; and if you must see this film, like I did, by all means go to a matinee.",Freddy vs. Jason

495,virtualstranger,Who was that masked man....,7,27 August 2003,"This film wasn't as good as it could've been, but definitely not as bad as it could've been, either.  Some of the blood effects were overdone (almost bordering on Monty Python), which I thought this genre had really moved past, and the teen actors/ characters were all pretty flat.  Overall, though, I paid matinee prices, laughed, jumped, and definitely felt I got my money's worth.
Only one thing really stood out to me, and I have to admit I was amazed that it did.  Ken Kirzinger as Jason Vorhees simply didn't work for me.  Part of it may have been a series of shots that made him look unnaturally tall (close to eight feet, it seemed at times).  Part of it may have been the different look they established for the character, in wardrobe and makeup. I think a good part of it, though, was that it wasn't Kane Hodder behind the mask.  Over the past decade and a half or so, Hodder has imbued Jason Vorhees with a particular style of movement and body language.  Since Jason doesn't speak, this has all become an integral part of the character, much like Freddy's signature quips or James Bond's British accent.  Kirzinger's Jason lacked these elements.
Yes, I know how silly it sounds to attribute ""integral elements"" to a character like Jason Vorhees, but the fact is through this whole movie, I was not seeing ""Jason"" but ""some guy dressed up like Jason""....  I don't know if this is the fault of the actor or the director, but it is one thing that really stood out to me....",Freddy vs. Jason

Coherent plot, plenty of blood and guts, and I'm set. Pretentious amateur Roger Ebert I am not.And this film delivers exactly what anyone who watched it should have wanted or expected.If you like to concern yourself with tiny plot holes, and not-Oscar caliber acting, don't bother watching Freddy v.

It was terrible, brought shame to the already crappy sequels to NOES and F13...The acting, oh my god the acting..Well...""acting""...So terrible, I mean, these people don't even belong in a Soap Opera, and the deal with a Destiny Childs star in it?...The movie was your typical over hyped, horrible actors, pointless, cursing evey other word, and some sex and drugs were added for some flavor. The director did an awful job. Like, I mean...Even if this movie was made for just the fans it so failed at it, everything was just so bad.

I liked the ending of this film,  but in my opinion Freddy Kruger had some really tacky lines like Arnold did in Terminator 3, but that didn't really ruin the movie for me it just made me cringe a few times.  Anyhow, I would definitely rent this movie and possibly buy it on DVD when it comes out. My rating is 6/10.

501,Billius,A Fun Film!,8,16 August 2003,"*WARNING, I GIVE AWAY ONE OF FREDDY's SIGNATURE QUIPS* I think most of the people who didn't enjoy this film simply misinterpreted what it was supposed to be; a fun, fast paced, action packed, gore obsessed 97 minutes of total horror movie fun.  And it was, oh it was.Perhaps what I enjoyed about this film the most was the insane pace it kept throughout the film.  There aren't a lot of breaks in the action, no long drawn-out discussions about Vorhees women or other such technicalities, just lots of cool nightmare sequences, staking and of course lots of rumbling between Freddy and Jason.And oh, were the rumbles great. The fight scenes between the two titans of terror alone make this film worth seeing.  Of course, Freddy chimes in every once and a while with a few classic one liners, although perhaps my favorite one from this film was more of a one `worder' (""Tilt!"").The visual effects were also very good in this film.  Freddy's transformation sequences are shockingly good and make you jump out of your seat.  The opening credits are also very well done......However, just because the movie is fun doesn't mean that our two favorite slasher icons have gone soft. The Freddy in this film is somewhere between the darker, slicker, more evil Freddy of New Nightmare and perhaps the more comic Freddy of the past.  Jason is also in fine form, continuing his relentless pursuit of innocents.The biggest downside I saw in this film was the fact that Betsy Palmer didn't reprise the role of Pamela Vorhees, (now that would have been really cool).All in all a fun movie to watch, people who grew up with Freddy and Jason should enjoy it.",Freddy vs. Jason

Freddy was his funny self which was GREAT and Jason was his serious ""You can run as fast as you can and I will STILL catch you even though I am slowly walking"" self. The way these two start fighting is actually brilliant. And there is a part where Freddy actually goes inside Jason's dream that is really cool. All in all, it's your basic cheesy horror movie, but this one stands a little higher than the rest. OH and the ending, WHAT A COPPOUT....Ronny Yu couldn't didn't have the guts to declare a winner, he makes us think Freddy won, then Jason comes back to kill Freddy, only to see Jason walking out of Camp Crystal Lake with Freddy's decapitated head, then Freddy winks at the camera...PLEASE GIMME A FRIGGEN BREAK, that was totally the queerest part of the movie and a total no sack ending...I wanted to see one of them Die, but I guess it's never gonna happen.",Freddy vs. Jason

The writer could continue right where Freddy vs. Jason left off (Jason burying freddy's head) and make it more like the original. Give Jason a motive to kill (like him guarding the camp).

You will never look at a Nightmare on Elm street or Friday the 13th movie the same way again.  One flaw though,  the movie has a little too much sexual content including sex itself which runs awhile in the story therefor fully deserving that R.

From start on the killing gets on and some are quite gore, which I really like. The number of killings is real high, maybe somewhat too high, but hey better this than no killing at all in the first hour like the new trend in Horror movies is.I also liked the end of this film.

This film doesn't try to take itself too seriously nor does it try to be a truly terrifying movie because if it did it would fall flat on its face much like AVP did. Here Ronny Yu delivers a fast paced, energetic, action packed, blood soaked thriller that doesn't try to be either a Freddy or a Jason film but instead finds a comfortable place in the middle.Unlike AVP, the film doesn't rely on its paper thin characters to sell the film to the audience. The film relies on its title characters. Both Freddy & Jason are given lots of screen time as well as lots of glorious moments for both characters. Freddy has some great dream sequences while Jason has plenty of bloody & creative kills. Some fans have complained that Freddy steals scenes, as well as the whole film, from Jason. However that cannot be helped. Given the nature of both characters Freddy would steal the moments from Jason because Freddy obviously talks and is very hyper-active characetr while Jason doesn't do anything but kill.Fans of both characters won't be disappointed in the slightest with this film.

After killing Jason, they show us his hockey mask on the floor. And suddenly, Freddy's claw hand appear and take the Mask, as we hear Freddy's laugh. So I would have liked that, so the watchers can understand how that happened.All in All, Great Movie, I recommend all the horror fans to watch it!",Freddy vs. Jason
524,winstonsims431,My first horror film that I saw in theatres,10,8 February 2015,"oh sure I saw re-runs of films like The Fly. The Blob. Killer Clowns From Outer Space. Orca. Jaws. Gremlins. The Howling. Cujo & Critters back in the 90s and i watched R.L. Stines Goosebumps on weekends. along with Buffy the vampire slayer during the week but mostly when it came to horror my dad aways said ""thats too scary for you"" or he'd change the channel and turn on something like The Flinstones or The Jetsons until ""december 8th 2002"" i turned 11 years old and that following summer of 03 I kept seeing promos for something called ""Freddy Vs Jason"" now nightmare on elm street and Friday the 13th were both in the category that my dad classified as too scary so naturally i knew he wouldn't let me see this in theatres and naturally i was surprised when he said ""Hey son wanna go see Freddy Vs Jason in theatres"" before I could reply he followed up by saying ""now I'm gonna warn you its gonna be scary so its up to you. but if you wanna go see it we can and if it gets too scary we'll leave"". after a few minutes of hesitation i said ""Yes"". after seeing it for the first time on opening weekend i saw it 5 more times in theatres before buying it on video. (yes I loved it that much) I'm 23 years old now and i still love this movie it sucks we never got a sequel and probably never will. but at least i can always watch this and tell my kids and grandkids about it being the first horror film i saw in theatres",Freddy vs. Jason
525,Pat_ChoKo,An Insult To Both Franchises.,1,24 April 2008,"Perhaps no other horror film in history, at least in the Slasher sub-genre, was as anticipated as Freddy vs Jason. After spending years in development hell, the film was unleashed onto the public in August of 2003. Oh boy....First, let me say that I am a huge fan of both franchises. I was raised on these films, and although some of them in both series', hit below the mark in many areas (Jason X, Freddy's Dead, etc.) none of them reached the lows that Freddy vs Jason plummeted to.First, the film really doesn't have the feel of either series. Instead of the stark visuals and above average cinematography that we're used to seeing from the Friday the 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street films, Freddy vs Jason looks like something you'd see in a direct-to-video release.Next, the acting in this film is absolutely dreadful. I know some would say that neither series was known for it's Oscar caliber performances, but never has it been this bad. Plus, even if the acting was up to par, we wouldn't care, because none of the characters are likable... AT ALL.Of course, what would Friday the 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street be without their respected patriarchs Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger? Neither are given justice in this film. Jason seems to have changed ethnicity between films, and the Freddy-mythology that even the lesser-quality Freddy sequels was built on has been drastically altered.Who could forget the trademarks of these films: The special effects? Well, in this one, Jason looks like a seven-foot homeless person who, thanks to a particularly robotic and stiff performance by Ken Kirzinger (who should not be mentioned in the same sentence as Kane Hodder and Ted White) does nothing more than stand on his mark and slowly swing his machete, which even seems to grow by several feet between scenes.The Freddy make-up in this one isn't consistent either. It looks like a paint by numbers project which not even Robert Englund can bring to life.The writing is also particularly bad. Many scripts for FVJ were rejected. The question is: Why wasn't this one thrown into the fire with the previously rejected scripts? It's THAT bad. Characters spout exposition in nearly every scene, Jason disappears for a good 30 minutes (without explanation), and the dialog is brutal. (""Freddy died by fire, Jason by water; how can we use that?"") See what I mean? The film is more of a spoof on the genre than a full-fledged entry.The title is also misleading. This film is not really Freddy vs Jason, but Freddy and Jason vs Teenagers. Only in the last 20 minutes do the title characters fight, and it doesn't really pay off. To say that this film is anti-climactic would be an understatement.As fan of these films, I find this movie insulting to both the previous films, and the fans as well. As bad as some of the other sequels may be, this one takes the cake as the worst in both series'.1/10, although I'd give it a 0 if I could.",Freddy vs. Jason
526,jlemon-1,"Aww man, another boring horror movie; NOT!",10,27 December 2005,"Of course you would think that it is a plain Freddy Krueger/Jason Voorhees horror flick, but it is not! The movie starts off when a hot naked chick goes for a VERY quick swim, then, for no reason, gets killed, and then Freddy takes over Jason's mind and starts controlling it, telling Voorhees to kill so he can have more ""power"", in which is Jason's dream!So, after 2 or 3 people are killed by Voorhees, Krueger decides that is enough for Jason, but Jason just cannot stop! To tell you the truth, Freddy should not even be in this movie; he kills no one! People die and get slaughtered, and in the end, they are still both alive!",Freddy vs. Jason
527,CosmoBubba,Clash of the Slasher Titans,10,6 July 2004,"Ten years is a long time to wait for something. But on August 15, 2003, the wait ended and the world bore witness to the ultimate clash of the titans. Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger finally do battle, a movie that slasher fans have been waiting a lifetime for.The movie actually tries to have a deeper plot than other Fridays and Nightmares, so let's get to that. We start with a monologue from Freddy Krueger, played for the eighth time by Robert Englund. Everyone in his hometown of Springwood has managed to forget about Freddy, and the fear he thrives on is gone. That makes sense to me. Freddy hadn't been seen since 1994's New Nightmare, so I'm sure many people really had forgotten about him. Out of sight, out of mind. So Freddy's scoured the depths of Hell to get someone to strike fear into the heart of Elm Street, someone to make them remember him. There's only one person that fits the bill: Crystal Lake's resident machete-swinging hockey fan, Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger). Jason awakens from his grave and heads to Springwood, where he proceeds to go on a killing spree. Unfortunately, he goes too far, and Freddy decides that he's gotta stop Jason from killing all of his potential victims. Caught in the middle are Lori (Monica Keena), her boyfriend Will (Jason Ritter), and a group of their friends, who try desperately to stop both killers while their world comes crashing down around them.Luckily, they don't alter Freddy or Jason's backstories, but add interesting twists to them. Past scripts were just unfortunately idiotic (such as one where Jason is a real guy that gets arrested and put on trial, and another where it's revealed that Freddy is really Jason's father), but Mark Swift and Damian Shannon hit the mark with their screenplay. They didn't dwell on the dream demons of Freddy's Dead or the body hopping of Jason Goes To Hell. As much as I love Jason Goes To Hell, I think not mentioning that was a good idea. It took Jason and Freddy back to their roots: Jason is an invincible killing machine, and Freddy is a sadistic monster.The characters of Freddy and Jason not only went back to their roots, but they evolved as well. In the past, Freddy was a loudmouth jerk, but in Freddy Vs. Jason, he becomes true evil. He's an egotistical pervert, he's insulting, he's even a racist. And in this one, we see what has only been referenced to in the past: he murders a child. The murder itself isn't on-screen, but we know it happens.I said two paragraphs up that Jason was a killing machine. That's not entirely true. He's more complex than that now. Part of Jason's mythology is that he drowned as a child, but in at least three prior Fridays, he jumps into Crystal Lake. He's not afraid of it when he's awake, but in his dreams, he's still a little boy. We see that in the past, Jason was a victim of bullying and humiliation from other campers, and he never forgot that. As an adult, he's not afraid, but in his subconscious, he's still scared.Robert Englund once again hits the mark as Freddy. Sure, he's got the trademark one-liners, but he's an intimidating figure. If I didn't know any better, I'd swear Englund was a psycho in real life, because he's that convincing. As for Jason, Ken Kirzinger does a great job. Kirzinger's Jason was a lot more human, yet is still an unstoppable beast. I like Kane Hodder's Jason, but he only portrayed Jason's hatred for others, while Kirzinger managed to convey fear and despair.I liked the acting of the others in the movie as well. Monica Keena is great as the movie's requisite cutie-pie heroine. She's just so cute and innocent, and like all good heroines, she grows from a naïve girl to a tough young woman. Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland (who plays Kia) way exceeded my expectations. Going in, I thought she was gonna end up being like LL Cool J or Busta Rhymes in the last two Halloween movies: a singer that's just there to be the token black person and/or comic relief. Yes, Kia had some comedic moments, but Kelly Rowland was a better actress than I thought she'd be. The rest of the cast put up a commendable effort as well, most notably Jason Ritter and Kyle Labine (who does his best impersonation of Jason Mewes as the film's token pothead). I'm easy to please in the acting category, though. If they're not embarrassingly bad like the fifth or eighth Friday movies, I'm happy.The two fight scenes are unbelievable. They met my expectations and surpassed them. The sheer brutal awesomeness of them, especially the second one, is mind-blowing. The two killers quite literally rip each other to shreds, but still get up for more. I should also point out Graeme Revell's wonderful score. If you ask me, I think it's light-years ahead of the music from Nightmares and Fridays from the past. While the only recurring themes from past sequels are Jason's trademark sound effect and two brief reprisals of Charles Bernstein's classic Nightmare theme, Revell's music creates a frightening atmosphere that gives the movie a much darker tone. Good stuff.The movie takes itself very seriously. It's not self-referential or a parody like prior films in each series, but a balls-to-the-wall horror movie. Personally, I think Freddy Vs. Jason is almost perfect. Yes, it's a Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday The 13th sequel, and therefore will catch a lot of crap from non-fans, but it was worth the years spent waiting for it. The movie was a dream come true (I almost said ""nightmare,"" but that would have been goofy), and I applaud director Ronny Yu, the cast and crew, and New Line Cinema for making this fan happy.",Freddy vs. Jason
528,amynickod,Better Than Expected,7,17 August 2003,"Long time horror fan here and going into this film I really wanted to like it, unfortunately I also thought it could easily be a bad film.  I happy to report I enjoyed it, while the plot involving the teenagers was silly and poorly acted, the film did have to have something to work of.  The film had everything that Freddy and Jason fans love about their movies-over the top violence, silly dialogue, gratuitous nudity. The showdown with Fredddy and Jason was a lot of fun to watch on the big screen. Freddy VS Jason was not an Oscar nominee, but definitely a lot of fun for any fan of the genre.",Freddy vs. Jason
529,Big Ed The Assassin,"Never thought ""Evil vs. Evil"" could be so Good!!!",10,15 August 2003,"Whoa!!! I recommend that anyone who has ever enjoyed a single moment of a Freddy or a Jason film go see this one as soon as possible, because; people are going to be talking about this one. I have seen my fair share of movies in my day, but can only count on one hand how many of them ended with the crowd standing on seats cheering. The ultimate sequel is here.  Freddy vs. Jason is as awesome and vicariously graphic as one could invision. Two of the most feared men face off in what is a spectacular sequel. Now I'm no fanatic but, I gotta spread the word on this one 'cause it's defenitley a great flick.",Freddy vs. Jason
530,IKETURNERFAN,SPOILERS........ Worthless movie!!!!,1,16 August 2003,"OK... I went into this movie really wanting to like it... but New Line apparently did not want that to happen.  You would think in a battle, of the 2 biggest horror movie icons of all time, that they would at the VERY least make it even.  I refuse to believe Freddy would beat the snot out of Jason as bad as he did in this piece of trash.  I refuse to acknowledge the existence of this movie.  Not only were the fights one-sided to the extreme... but the killing had no creativity at all... I've come to expect more from Jason than just slashing with a machete... which is all he does in this flick.  0/10... this was worthless.",Freddy vs. Jason
531,agleouras,As Expected,7,20 September 2020,"I grew up with Freddy and a little bit of Jason. This film delivered excactly what I expected. Two titans of the genre going toe to toe against each other, first at Freddy's ground, then at Jason's. Obviously the movie is not a masterpiece and none expected it to be but it's still good in its own terms",Freddy vs. Jason
532,hirashah1218,Battle of Evil,8,10 March 2008,"This movie is very action-full. It is about the fight between 2 killers: Freddy Krueger and Jason Vorhees. Freddy Krueger was burnt alive by parents when he was younger because he used to kill kids, so Freddy returns in the dream-world. Jason, on the other hand kills because kids used to make fun of him and one day they drowned him in the water. Freddy Krueger needs strength in order to kill, and he gets strength by the fear of kids from him. So, he brings Jason back so he can scare all the kids, so they can think Freddy is in town. The kids get scared, so Freddy gets strength to kill and wants to get rid of Jason because he has taken advantage of him already. But, Jason wont leave so the battle begins: evil vs. evil as the kids try to kill Freddy. This movie is action and has a little thrilling. I will give it 4 stars out of 5. I recommend this movie for teens over the age of 17 and hope you enjoy it!! I hope this comment helped you get a vivid image of what you will be seeing in this movie.",Freddy vs. Jason
533,Tanuki-Suit,The Movie Of The Year,10,16 August 2003,"Upon witnessing one aptly titled work of art such as Freddy Versus Jason, I could not help but notice the complete absence of anything else of a similar quality gracing cinemas today. Putting it mildly, this movie is a brilliant accomplishment on all fronts, and achieves all of it's intended aims, whether it be as a poignant social commentary or as an aspiring buddy comedy. Freddy Versus Jason truly has everything. The memorable acting of Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and Ken Kirzinger is certainly worthy of dual Oscar nominations. The audience easily bears witness to the tormented being behind the hockey mask donned on Jason Vorhees, and the demonic nature of Freddy Krueger who so calously manipulates Jason to accomplish his own Satanic resurrection.On thematic levels the film is rather striking as one would expect from the horror genre. Freddy Versus Jason concisely comes across as a caustic commentary on teenage culture and the excesses therein, such as gratuitous drug use, premarital sex, and underage drinking. It is only fitting that in a society so fundamentally held together by good old family values that these preteen offenders be met with the most gruesome deaths fathomable after violating these covenants. In a similarly brilliant manner, Freddy Versus Jason works splendidly as a noteworthy addition to the buddy comedy genre. The underlying camaraderie can easily be witnessed between the two psychopathic immortal killers, and the manner in which Freddy so angrily reacts to learning of Jason Vorhees infringement on his ""turf"" is vaguely reminiscent of a Martin Lawrence or Will Smith picture, or better yet one featuring both fine actors.In conclusion, one can only be mortified should this film come up short at the Oscars next March, and any oversight on the part of the Academy would truly be unforgivable given the way Freddy Versus Jason delivers in every respect. Seeing this film is bound to change the life of all who give it the chance it deserves, and give cause to reflect on lifes little foibles, and how two deranged maniacs sent back from hell really make you see how fragile life really is.",Freddy vs. Jason
534,RooKieRaCeR04,Fantastic Movie,10,15 August 2003,"This movie has been ten years in the making and for the most part it has been worth the wait.You will never be able to please people with horror films, because most people are not fans of the genre.  But what are people expecting with a film like this?  The movie is meant to entertain you with a slash-slash here and a slice-slice there.  Think about it, there are 10 Friday the 13th's and 7 Nightmare on Elm Street's.  These movies are not going away so people who are not accustomed to them or fans of them should just not comment on them, because these movies are not made for them.The movie delivers just like the rest of the films, it entertains and that is the main point.  The story is written well for what it needed to accomplished and it brings us a sense of understanding without being wrapped up too much into a storyline and drawing us away from the real point that we came to see the movie, the unique deaths as well as the fact that these two iconic figures are finally meeting!After 10 years since Freddy's claw was shown in Jason Goes To Hell, they are finally brought together.  I was satisfied with how it was brought forth in the beginning as well as the entire duration of the film.  And of course the ending accomplished what it needed to do, leave it open for both these characters to return in whatever future projects they could be involved in.As a horror fan, I would give it a 5 out of 5 Stars.  Out of an average, uneducated person to these two characters, I give it a 5 out of 5 Stars. This move did was it was meant to do, entertain.",Freddy vs. Jason
535,mowat_will,Does what it was meant to do.,8,19 September 2003,"This review is for the people picking apart this movie because of the bad acting, etc.This movie achieves what it set out to do. It was not meant to be an acting masterpiece. If it was, every horror fan in the world wouldn't want to watch it.It was meant to showcase these two legends in the environment in which we grew up watching them. The acting was done exactly the way it was meant to be done.As for Jason not speaking. Jason was never meant to speak, to make him have cheesy lines in this movie would have ruined it. Ronny Yu did an excellent job re-creating these two characters. He did not mess with the formula (except Kane Hodder) and kept true to the roots of both of these characters.For what it set out to do, this movie was a 10. People try to compare this to other movies that are un-comparable. This movie was made to be like it's counter parts. There are a lot of inside jokes, and I guarantee you the over acting etc. was done ON PURPOSE.People need to stop reading so much into movies like this. They aren't meant to win an Oscar, they are meant to appeal to horror fans and people who enjoy an action packed movie. If you are into artistic movies, or analyzing every little detail don't bother watching this movie. It was not made for you.I give this movie 8/10. Just because no Kane (Jason was played well anyways, but for nostalgia's sake) and I don't like cgi effects in my horror movies. I prefer a good make up artist and stunt men. They did keep the effects down to a minimum, and they were well done, but once again for nostalgia's sake.8/10",Freddy vs. Jason

537,sidoious,about what you'd expect,7,15 August 2003,"The story didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought it would be (after watching interviews) and reading spoilers. Big plothole which happens to be the crux of the storyline, but so as not to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet, I won't mention it, although I'm sure when you see the movie you'll have the same question. The gore wasn't too bad considering what the horror genre has regressed to nowadays. Most of the gore consists of spurting arteries which kind of gets lost in the nighttime photography after a while. The lead actress did a good job (she kinda looks like a VERY healthy Brittany Murphy), although the cast as a whole grated on my nerves. Saw the first screening at the Regal today around noon...surprised how many kids found their way in. Half the crowd was 14 or under, and half of that number was supervised. Youngest kid I saw was 7 or 8, he didn't seem too fazed. Not a bad waste of time this summer, can't say I was too surprised with the ending...just about what I thought should have happened did happen.Much better than Jason X...this movie really wants you to sympathize with the Jason character however, so take that under consideration when you see this film.",Freddy vs. Jason

This movie kicks in so many ways it's not funny!  Gore galore, great T&A, great one liners by the crispy one, great flick to see.  On a down note, the dialogue was putrid in some areas (remedied by Freddy or Jason, if you know what I mean) and Kane Hodder is missed as hockey puss.  Damn New Line, don't screw us again!

Personally, I loved it. It had flaws, yeah, I knew that it would before I went in to see it and I watched it for the good movie that it is without having too much of high hopes for it.The theater I was at was packed, and when I left there were people buying tickets for the second showing.  I sensed that this movie might do pretty good given that neither Friday the 13th films or Nightmare on Elm Street films has burned up the box office for a while now.I know a lot of people wanted to see this movie, and I hoped that they went in with an open mind or they will probably be disappointed.  No movie could have lived up to the wait and high hopes that surrounded this movie.I had fun when I watched it and I fully got my money's worth.

But that in a way is the films blessing in diguise because director Ronny Yu obviously saw this and not try to cover up the comedy elements of the film but instead emulate on them. Therefore if you want to a horror film that pokes fun at itself and contains plenty of cliches then i recommend you go and see freddy vs. jason as it is at the end of the day just a good piece of fun with unnecessary (but very nice) female nudity and plenty of gore which prevents the film from being completely rubbish by providing good comedy elements and a nice showdown between freddy and jason. On the whole, just a fun film and nothing else.",Freddy vs. Jason

They way they bring Freddy and Jason together was interesting and not the way most people would suspect, which is good. It had some entertaining characters (the pothead, the crazy monkey guy...) who were unfortunetly killed off (as is expected) but the heroine got a little annoying at times. All together the whole plot is a bit off-tilt but it's not like it's meant to be an academy award winner and Freddy's and some various character's humor makes up for it. I know a lot of people were looking forward to this movie to see which of the two infamous serial killers would take the gold but the ending doesn't satisfy. I gave it a 7 because it had some good parts but then it also had a few too many crappy parts plus the forehead-smacking ending (which leaves room for a sequel).",Freddy vs. Jason

I gave this movie a 10.. it was funny gory.. and even though Kelly Rowland (Destiny's Child) told a.j. and Free on 106&park that she doesn't die.. u bet damn well she does lol.. she's like.. i'm a black girl we never die.. u did girl!! lmao Go see it... it's off tha hook",Freddy vs. Jason

I'm tired and unsure if I said that strike write strike right. as for gore for it's own sake, Jason X was more innovative. the bar has been raised since the glory days of these two franchises and they could have bumped it up another notch or two for my tastes.or are all the studios saving the best stuff for the DVD's now? Robert Englund seemed a bit unenthusiastic and overly cartoonish at times.but, I suppose that was true of several instances during the series as well.as much as I hate when people say this, but; for anyone who's followed either series, it's really about what you should expect.",Freddy vs. Jason

In general, I like old films of the movie series. I think this movie has go so far from them: the time change, a lot has happened ... has entered a new world opened up and new developments, but the direction, the overall concept, and so remained the same. Anyway, after a certain time, perhaps, the film will look more and more demanded audience of the future. We will not further the plot, but let's go over the details. Mental hospital did not cause absolutely no interest memories, lunatics do not look colorful like in old times. Cases Jason and Kruger and no specialpreferences (if only to remember how all sorts of pranks in the past was part of the adventure on Elm Street ... there's so not), and when Freddy using an abundance oftechniques like Master Yoda - this is bullshit, the very stupid,impudent, stinking bullshit.

546,GarlicBreathD,Jason and Freddy fans rejoyce!,9,15 August 2003,"I first saw Friday the 13th in 1980 when I was 10 years old, and A Nightmare on Elm Street four years later.  Ever since then, for the last nineteen years, I have been involved in many a horror-geek debate on who would win in a fight; Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger.  Well today I got to find out! Freddy vs. Jason, a project ten years in the making, was well worth the wait.  At first I was skeptical.  I always wondered how both of these horror icons would wind up on the screen together.  The premise, however unbelieveable, actually serves the purpose of making the aforementioned possible.  Remember, we're not here for the plot.  Freddy, after years in Hell, has been forgotten about by the kids on Elm Street.  (He lets us know this in what seems to be somewhat of a Greek Chorus early in the film.) Being forgotten has made him weak, and therefore he cannot terrorize the children in their dreams anymore.  Ah, but there is someone in Hell with him who can ""make them remember what fear tastes like.""  You've got it, our good friend and old mass murderer, Jason.  Freddy, posing as Jason's mother instructs Jason to go to Elm Street and instill fear into the kids the only way he knows how, in order to make Freddy strong again.  Jason arises from the grave, and the mayhem begins.  How does Freddy have the power to return Jason to the land of the living, when he can't re-enter kids dreams? Don't worry about it.  Just go with it.  After a few grisly murders, the townsfolk begin to murmur the name Freddy Krueger once again,  and now Freddy slowly becomes stronger. However, it seems Jason is having too much fun slicing and dicing the kids, and Freddy wants what's his.  Hence the rivalry between the titans.The movie has everything a die hard Jason and Freddy fan could ever want. The acting is juvenile at best on the part of the teen actors;  Jason is as hulking and massive as ever; Freddy delivers some great one-liners; there's gratuitous nudity, some inventive kills, and tons and tons of blood and gore.  The final battle between the two is nothing short of bloody mayhem. It's a splatter flick fan's dream!  Director Ronnie Yu breathes new life into these two dying franchises with fervor.  This (Jason) fan, hopefully along with many, many others, will see them live on, and on, and on.....WINK! (You know the one!)",Freddy vs. Jason

I felt like saying, do you know anything about the saga's.  I resisted and went into the almost empty cinema for the very first showing.I will be fair, and say that I had one minor gripe with the film, and that was only because I felt the dialogue dragged slightly in a few scenes, but meant well.  Apart from that, I believe it may not be well received by new comers, who are just going for the fun of it.  But for the rest of us, (I hope), It answers the age old question which we all knew.  Freddy is stronger than Jason in the dreamworld, but still Jason draws power even in the dreamworld????, and Jason wrecks most things in the real world.  I wont spoil it for you but the ending is very cool, and all must remember one thing.Whatever happens in the end, THEY ARE BOTH ALREADY DEAD. so dont get too upsetThe fans will love this film as did I and I just hope there are more movies to come.Well done Ronnie yu",Freddy vs. Jason

549,Dante_Filth,"""Sick"" sums up the whole movie",10,16 August 2003,"Aight, i saw this yesterday, and it was amazing, I mean just simply sick. Every murder is insane, some of them have a few good laughs if you're watching it with your friends. The fight between Jason and Freddy was amazing, they were literally killing each other, Freddy had some nice combinations and a few comic lines. Anyway, I find this movie the surprise horror hit of 2003. I can't really put this in other words beside SICK. I friggin loved it from start to finish. 10/10",Freddy vs. Jason
550,FreddyFan,Very Impressed,9,19 August 2003,I am obviously a big fan of freddy but i am also a fan of Jason.  While i was walking into the movie theater the day after the black out i was thinking to myself of all the different scenarios that could take place at the end of this movie.  I never thought of what really happend in the movie.Now about the movie.  The killings were very well done.  Lots of blood which makes it look a lot better.  If you want to watch this movie but have never watch a freddy or Jason movie i recommend that you watch jason 7 and freddy 1.  Both of those movies are great and they really show a lot about the 2 main characters.,Freddy vs. Jason
551,saxfiend,A fantastic voyage for horror fans!,10,18 September 2003,"I'm writing this review right now, although I don't know why, since no one is going to read my review and say ""Eureka"" and run out and see this film if they weren't already going to do so... likewise, no one is going to read a negative review of this film from a non-horror fan and then avoid it like the plague, unless that had been their original intention.  Still, after reading many negative reviews of this film and it's plot by reviewers who obviously either didn't view the film or didn't pay attention, I have been persuaded to right my review. First, let's address the plot.  The plot is creative and completely cohesive. If you didn't understand it then you either ignored the film or have a pitiful comprehension level.  Yes, there are a few short scenes that are slightly contradictory; but this is the nature of all but the finest films.  Most of the criticisms I have seen are drawn from glaring discrepancies between the plot of the film and what the viewer took away from it.  Sorry folks, but your inability to understand a plot doesn't condemn it to the dark depths of plot hell.  Next, the acting.  this is the biggest concern through the film.  As is typically for this genre, many of the actors and actresses were chosen more for their appearance than for their talents; and it shows.  The acting from Robert Englund is right on as always, and Jason Ritter shows some promise, but the rest of the cast is relatively weak.  Thankfully, director Ronny Yu and writers Shannon and Swift don't spend much time focusing on the weaker members of the cast, and therefore the momentum of the movie is spared (as well as our sanity.) All in all, the acting gets the job done and the flaws are hardly noticeable. The next section, the screenwriting.  This is creative, if not brilliant, and Shannon and Swift did an excellent job of melding things together and not disappointing fans of either franchise.  There is at least one line of very cheesy dialogue, but there are also many brilliant lines and creative exchanges that make the movie worthwhile.  Lastly, the action.  This is the films high point.  It is an (almost) non-stop ride that could keep even the most snobbish and pretentious reviewer entertained (though whether or not he would admit it afterwards is always up to chance.)  The sequences are well choreographed and executed, and the camera work keep you riveted to the action on screen.  This is what this film was made to be, and exciting action-gore fest. Well, if you didn't like this film then chances are... surprise, surprise... it wasn't made for you!  This film was made for fans of the horror genre and for fans of either or both of the two main characters.  If you are none of the above, then I cannot imagine what possessed you to go see this film! This film goes above and beyond what it set out to do and creates a wet-dream for fans and non-fans alike; and as told by it's box office take and current user ratings, it's pretty popular... especially by horror standards.  And even if you loathed this film and horror in general, you've gotta admit... It's better than Gigli! 9.5 of 10",Freddy vs. Jason
552,owensmith2085,"Finally, two of the biggest icons of all horror come together and kick the crap out of each other",10,24 August 2003,"Many People from around the world thought that was Jason was the strongest, scariest, unstoppable, most pure evil killer in any movie, and many people thought that Freddy was the scariest, most evil, unstoppable killer in any movie, while some other people thought it was Michael Myers, Leatherface, Scream, whoever. And it seems that Freddy and Jason seem to be the two most scary serial killers ever. So finally it has come, the two biggest icons in all of horror come together for a death match.Jason is resurrected by Freddy to make people remember Freddy until Jason stands alone to bring back his old-fashioned killing style until Freddy gets a bit jealous amd angry that Jason is getting all the glory. So now its Freddy's turn; the two killers finally go at it and kick the living crap out of each other. No matter what happens it seems none of them can kill each other...just yet.",Freddy vs. Jason

I mean c'mon.... after almost 20 films combined, what could these two legends of horror have left for us???The answer is PLENTY!!!!I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!!!!LONG LIVE FREDDY AND JASON!!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
554,vestock2003,"Greatest Movie ever, next to LOTR",10,10 November 2003,"This is the greatest film ever made next to the two Lord Of The Rings Films. Anybody comparing this film next to Jason X shouldn't because that movie gave god cancer.  Anybody who hates this film proably is taking this film to seriously.  This film is just a good time and i say bring on fifty more freddy versus jason films.  The great thing is that this movie solves alot of problems.  Just broke up with your girlfriend, watch fvj.  Parents just died, watch fvj.  Just got your ass kicked, watch fvj.  Its just like funniens who also solves alot of problems.",Freddy vs. Jason
555,vestock2003,To The People Who Did Not Like This Movie,10,10 January 2004,"First, I realize that I'm not a good speller, so bare with me.I think that all the people who did not like this movie need to get the F*CK over themselves!  This is one of the greatest movies of all time!  This movie has everything!  Action!  Horror!  Comedy!  Great Comedy!  And the perfect ending!  I hate that people compare this movie to Jason X because Jason X was the most intelectually deloined film ever produced (besides fast and the furious of course.)  Freddy Vs. Jason had probably had one of the greatest fight scenes ever.  A satisfactory ending that make fans of the shonras argue forever who actually won in the end (I actually think its Jason.)  But what people don't realize is that this movie makes fun of itself!  It knows that its a cross betwenn two of the biggest horror series of all time and it makes fun of it.  One of the coolest prologs of all time, a cool opening title sequence, and a picture perfect ending.  I think that people should not always go to movies expecting the deepest or soul moving or greatest movie ever made.  People should just go to movies hoping for a good time.  And thats exactly what this film is:  A GOOD TIME.  Even if you hate gore or blood in films, you can still appreciate the scense of humor.",Freddy vs. Jason
556,Bobbywoodhogan,Freddy vs. Jason... Wow!,10,29 November 2003,"I have waited for this film for years and now it is finally here. I went to the pictures to see this on it's opening night (August 15th 2003) and when I left I couldn't stop smiling I had just seen the greatest one on one face off in the history of cinema. I loved it this was brilliant, this was the Freddy vs. Jason (although I believe it should have been titled Jason vs. Freddy like originally planned) I had always wanted to see but it was brilliant, it had great storyline, great actors (note: Ken Kirzinger did play a GOOD Jason but like most other Friday fans I would have prefered to see Kane Hodder behind the mask, oh well!) But to sum up I loved this film and gave it a vote of 10!I am looking forward to more versus movies in the future: Alien vs. Predator, Batman vs Superman, Freddy vs. Jason 2 (which I have heard Ken Kirzinger has already been signed to do) who will they pit against them I personally would like for it to be Leatherface (from the TCM Remake) or maybe Michael Myers or both. Now that would be cool. I also think Ash (Evil Dead) would be cool but he would have to be in FVJ3 'cause he would hav to win as he is the hero. Give me some sugar baby!I'm Lovin' It",Freddy vs. Jason
557,rydawg91,Undeserved hate,6,20 October 2021,"This movie is much better than most of the F13/Nightmare on elm street movies, with the exception of the first few of course. It's probably my favorite looking Jason as well.",Freddy vs. Jason
558,albertdahmen,Almost Perfect,9,6 November 2012,"I think the only reason I didn't give this movie the full ten stars is because I wanted a different winner. With that being said, though, this is definitely my favorite throwback to old school slasher material. I remember waiting for years to see this one. So many times where it was in the works, then forgot about. Then out of nowhere, it was finally happening. My cousin and I saw it in theaters on opening day ... three times.Yes, of course a lot of the acting is bad, but that doesn't stop me for one moment from having a great time watching this. Some of the dialogue is cheesy, and again, I'm perfectly okay with that. The main two things I wanted to see in this movie go as follows:1) Must have Freddy 2) Must have Jason... and boy, the movie serves up a great helping of both characters, and I couldn't walk away from this movie any happier. Perfect amount of gore, gratuitous nudity, bad language, and the same campy feel that I fell in love with many years ago.",Freddy vs. Jason
559,purrrtyinpink07,"Pointless, Pointless, Pointless",1,13 September 2005,I could describe this movie in one word. If I haven't made it clear to you slow people who liked this movie it is that it is POINTLESS. Plot line- Sucks Characters-Suck Everything about this movie was horrible. I haven't even been able to sit through the torment of this horrible film. The end left it open for a sequel but i know one thing.. I will not be seeing that movie. Slasher films made today are completely POINTLESS!!!! I don't think they should be made.. Everyone has seen the same movie 10 times only with a different killer and different characters. The only difference in this movie was that there was 2 killers WHOPDEEDOO!!!(notice the sarcasm!)Why am i even waisting my time on commenting on it. Bye,Freddy vs. Jason
560,Maverick00,The first movie with Freddy and Jason that has a good story!,7,6 April 2005,Well we all know the two characters in this movie they've scared people for years. Well some people anyway. Me I halft to have a decent story to go on before I can actually be scared. The first movie in each characters saga is decent and probably the best one. But then you have Freddy vs Jason know the two characters in this movie aren't really my favorite two horror characters but there OK. The whole thing with Freddy at the beginning of the movie with how the parents killed him was an awesome beginning. Then the fact that Freddy used Jason to instill fear back into the children of Elm Street was a pretty good twist on the story. But I wish they would have added on to the Jason story a little more than they did but thats just me. So overall I guess I liked the Freddy vs Jason pretty good and actually wouldn't mind a sequel whitch I have heard rumors about a sequel.,Freddy vs. Jason
561,baraqel,Sigh..,3,26 April 2005,"One one hand, we have Freddy Krueger, greatest horror villain ever to grace our screens, has the ability to enter your dreams and play out your wildest fears. On the other we have Jason, machete wielding, immortal, teen killing, ugly gigantic man. These two iconographic characters are forever graced our screens in countless sequels with rehashed plot lines. I respect Sean Cunningham and Wes Craven for making these two infallible characters but even before Freddy Vs. Jason was made, I felt that these characters and style has long been worn out. Wait, no it hasn't. They are back again, and wait, versing each other? Can you believe it? So, it seems it could be a never ending fight, Freddy in Jasons' dreams and Jason in the real world. But, unbelievably Jason is quite the victor, or so we are led to believe. The story of this movie is generally OK, until we get to the point where it just becomes hardcore, nu-metal bashing, total and utter generic teen-horror shite. The story: Freddy is no longer feared on Elm Street so by pretending to be Jason's mother he leads Jason to do his dirty work. Jason begins to start stealing Freddy's kills so Freddy is unable to gain power. This somewhat angers our good IL' Freddy, causing a battle of possession, tranquilizers, death and stupidity to ensue. Eventually Jason owns Freddy. Which is quite obvious considering Freddy gets pulled into the real world. Which, I feel is not explained properly and is stupid. This movie, for one, could've been so much better. In the right hands this movie could've have actually been passed off for decent. But, no. Another generic, turned out, sludge horror movie made to impress the masses with it's 'BOO'S' and it's Effects. Please, stay away from this movie.",Freddy vs. Jason
562,bpsoccerddr18,Good Movie...Toooooo much fake blood,5,25 August 2005,This movie was pretty good and entertaining but some things i didn't like about it were was all of the fake blood i mean seriously every 5 seconds wen sum1 gets killed i mean there is just blood squirtting everywhere! just a little too much fake blood...and the first scene what is with all the nudity it duznt make the movie any scarier but it seemed like that scene was kida like the first scene in Jaws where the naked girl goes swimming and while calling for her boyfriend she gets eaten (or in this case stabbed to a tree). So other than that it was a pretty good movie cudda been scarier but still good! I'd recommend seeing it if u were at all interested in Friday The 13th or A Nightmare On Elm Street or the horror/slasher genre.*#$ PeACe oUt $#*,Freddy vs. Jason
563,DoctaBuddah,.....entertaining.....,4,13 October 2005,"what can i say about this flick.....i guess, first off, i'd like to say i'm glad that it was finally made because i have been hearing rumors of this since i was in the 6th grade (which was 1989 by the way). i am a big fan of all horror movies. this one is entertaining. yes, the story is cheesy....but what horror movie story isn't? you don't watch this for the story, the plot, the acting....you see this strictly for the name alone --- ""FREDDY VS. JASON"" you know its a guilty pleasure for the battle Royal of 2 of the most famous killers in horror from the last 25years (yea, its been that long) the colors in the movie are nice...very nice....so nice it makes me wanna eat mushrooms again and re-watch this movie.....the acting does suck but at least Monica keena shows off her heaving cleavage in almost every shot....the blood is nice because i haven't really seen that much blood in a horror flick since ..... i don't know.... hellraiser 3??? (i am omitting jap-horror in this....check those out by the way) ....forget the story...don't concentrate on the acting....its all about the final ho-down between the 2 menacing figures known as Freddy and Jason......yea it sucks that Kane hodder wasn't chosen for this role ...i think he's been Jason since part 6? maybe starting part 7? oh yea...and there are things in this flick about Jason that apparently the director didn't realize before finalizing it....but aside from that its an OK flick...i got the DVD...i still break it out from time to time....hey, its better than watching infomercials of don lupre trying to sell me his magic formula for making a million dollars out of his tiny one bedroom apartment.

564,Stephen12693,Average Slice N' Dice,6,22 June 2006,"Freddy is back for the 8th time, and Jason for his 11th in this crossover of the two killers. This time, Freddy is forgotten and, without memories of his killings, is stuck in Hell. This is where Jason comes in. Freddy haunts Jason's dreams, and gets Jason to Elm Street. Jason, of course, kills, and gets the Elm Street kids off the drugs to forget Freddy, and are now... well... screwed. Soon, Jason fights Freddy, in his dreams, and the two finally fight in person, leading to the deaths of both. Or is it? No, it's not. In the ending, Jason comes out of the water, in which Freddy and Jason fell into, holding Freddy's head. Freddy winks.All in all, it's the average Horror / Slice N' Dice movie, except with two killers.A 6 out of 10",Freddy vs. Jason

He brought some help too, the serial killer who never dies: Jason Voorhees! Of course, due to Jason's killing addiction (he just won't stop! Jesus!), our two favorite villains soon become foes. And that's when the fun really begins... Lori lives in the house #1428 on Elm Street (yes, yes... Freddy's old lair). She doesn't know who lived there before, but she'll soon find out. A teen hunt is about to begin. Lori and her friends aren't safe awake or asleep. They must survive Freddy and Jason's attacks from Elm Street to Camp Crystal Lake. The effects are really good too and suspense is at every step. Lori and her friends must find a way to destroy the two killers once and for all. Will they?

Never before have Freddy and Jason faced off against another with whom they were so evenly matched.  The action is great, the effects are sharp and even the script is good (I especially liked the dream symbolism).  As good as it was, though, I do hope there is no sequel.

Something about me growing up with the good old horror movies has given me this fascination .. I remember watching Friday the 13th part 3 in secret at a friends house, stealing glimpses of Halloween, and then much later finally getting to see Nightmare on Elm Street after driving past the drive-in so many times and seeing it lit up in those big red letters drive-ins had, and of course my parents weren't about to take me!!Ah those were the days...But back to the story of today ... Freddy vs Jason .. if you like your horror movies then this is good entertainment, its enjoyable and fun, a few jumps and some good kills. Its nothing special but its got Freddy and its got Jason at their best. Well maybe not Freddy he disappointed me a little, seemed to miss his usual snap.Only down-side .. it wasn't a Freddy movie .. not enough dream/nightmare sequences .. and it wasn't a complete Friday movie, Jason didn't get to hunt down everyone, so left me wanting a touch more blood I guess.
Go see it .. people I know wrote it off and didn't see it but it was an entertaining movie!!",Freddy vs. Jason

A real R-rated horror movie with the obligatory blood and boobs you would expect if you're a fan of the genre. Jason in the cornfield is probably my favorite scene of any Freddy or Jason movie. Congratulations to the filmmakers for taking an wild idea and making it work.",Freddy vs. Jason
569,Rainy-13,Better than expected,8,17 August 2003,"Well, I didn't really expect anything when I went to see the movie. Just didn't want to get my hopes up and then have them literally »slaughtered«.There were quite a few logical mistakes in this one, but what do you expect from a horror flick of the splatter sort. It also was much more »splatter-heavy« than the other movies in each respective series.The movie ends in a »Dream World« state, which is a set up for the sequel.All-in-all, I liked it a lot. Never had this much fun watching two horror icons kicking pretty much anything out of each other. The insight in each of their pasts was also a rather welcome glimpse.Would I go and watch this movie again? Definitely! Will I buy the DVD? You bet I will!",Freddy vs. Jason
570,docbunny78,Horror vs. Comedy,9,18 September 2006,"Normally I don't really like that kind of horror movie. I would much prefer the originals movie or those released so many years ago.When Jason X was release, I didn't run to the nearest cinema, but I rent it once on DVD... and then kind of run with my brothers to buy it. Did it scare me that much? Nan, but it make me laugh that much. 3 years ago, when Jason vs. Freddy went on screen, I ran to my nearest theater. I paid $8,50 and then came late at work, but I considered it like a good investment. I laughed so much. So absurd and kitch somehow. Now, I'm not sure if the production take themselves seriously, but still, it my be a good comedy, kind of parody of themselves, I don't like the Horror Movie series. I went to watch the movie not expecting being scare by Freddy or Jason, but expecting a comedy. Whoever watch the movie expecting it to be as the original, a new chapter, will scream.On DVD, I've seen a trailer about another one with Freddy. I'm really looking forward to see it.",Freddy vs. Jason
571,WeatherExperiment,The Ultimate Battle Between the King of Slice-and-Dice and the Machete-Wielding Madman,8,22 August 2003,"Freddy vs Jason was well made in that it sticks to the basic formulas that both the ""Nightmare"" and ""Friday the 13th"" movies had previously established. Yet, the story is able to intertwine the two formulas without watering down the story. The dialog exchange between some of the teenage characters is somewhat cheesy. But that was the kind of dialog we heard in the original movies that came out back in 1980 (Friday the 13th) and 1984 (A Nightmare on Elm Street). It's possible the cheesy dialog is used on purpose.Freddy's snappy one-liners shows that he hasn't lost his comedic touch. Of course, Jason doesn't speak. So, his menacing presence and strength are played out to the fullest and speak volumes without words.The movie contains a number of subplots during the first half of the movie, which all stem from the main plot of the Freddy/Jason battle, and play a large part in helping the teenagers figure out why Freddy and Jason have teamed up. Amazingly these subplots, while there are many of them, are easy to follow and give the characters reasons to want to stop this battle once and for all and put an end to the hellish antics of these two feared nemeses of Camp Crystal Lake and Springwood USA's Elm Street.All in all, this is a movie worth seeing on the big screen for the action-packed battles between Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. The one-liners by Freddy are always clever and sometimes funny. There are a few times where you are taken off-guard by moments of terror and shock. And aside from some poor dialog between some of the minor characters, the main characters, used as pawns by Freddy to get to Jason, act their parts well. The gore and blood in Freddy vs Jason are plentiful. Squeamish viewers may want to pass on this hack-and-slash fest. If you can stand the slicing and dicing, don't be afraid to go see one of the most intense battles ever fought on the big screen - Freddy vs Jason.The only thing you have to fear...is fear himself!",Freddy vs. Jason
572,aceg682001,It's good to see these horror icons still kicking,9,10 September 2006,"I love this movie. It's the kind of movie that you just have fun with, and not take it too seriously. I'm a fan of the the Friday the 13th's and Nightmare movies - it was really good to finally see these two battle. Too bad it had so much human involvement 'cause they seemed unimportant in my opinion. Who cares if Freddy killed Monica dad etc. He had done things like that many 'a time before, it would of been better to revolve the movie around Freddy and Jason.It would be great to see these two battle it out one more time with a real winner instead of a draw to keep the fanboys happy.

577,MrDisgusting,Freddy vs Jason is a gift from New Line (Six Page Review),10,15 August 2003,"IntroductionMost reviews don't include an introduction but Freddy vs Jason is quite the exception. Back almost exactly ten years ago, on August 13th 1993, I was in a theater watching Friday the 13th 9: Jason Goes to Hell and to my surprise, Freddy's glove popped out of the ground and grabbed Jason's mask in the closing seconds. Now a decade later, after years of speculation, years of anticipation and years of rumors I was finally sitting in a theater waiting for what could and should be one of the best horror movies of all time. For most people, the wait has been nothing, but being a news reporter on a horror site doesn't make it easy. Every day I was posting either rumors, or storylines, or new pictures. We all sat in anticipation for the website to go live and for the trailer to hit the web. For all that I've went through, I have never been so hyped in my life for a movie and now here I was in the theater awaiting New Lines present to the horror fans for all of our patients and support....Where to begin, oh where to begin. Have you ever been so hyped up for something, it actually ruined the experience? I have numerous times, but when it comes to Freddy vs Jason, words cannot explain the shear joy I have just endured even after all of the hype. I was quivering with goose bumps nearly the entire movie! Ronny Yu has become a horror legend in my eyes, turning a seemingly dead Childs Play franchise around with his masterful work of Bride of Chucky and now this. Ronny Yu and New Line are perfect compliments to each other. New Line has become incredibly efficient at taking horror to the next level (ie. superior amounts of blood), while Ronny Yu has an eye of a fan and brings everything to the plate that makes a horror movie a horror movie, with a new eye towards it.
First let me explain to you what's going on in Freddy vs Jason, so you know how New Line brought these two horror icons together, showing the ten years of effort it took them to get things right. The basic premise is that the kids have forgotten about Freddy Krueger, and everything is well in Springwood. Freddy is still banished in hell after his real world demise in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare; that is until Freddy comes up with a gruesome plan. As you all know, Freddy gains his power from the ""myth,"" kind of like the Candyman. Freddy soon awakens Jason (I won't say how), who is laying dead in his own hell, repeating his life on earth over and over again in his mind, and ""tricks"" him into killing the kids on Elm Street to invoke the fear within the kids of Springwood. Slowly but surely Freddy regains his power and Jason becomes no use to him. During the charades, Lori (Monica Keena), Kia (Kelly Rowland), Gibb (Katharine Isabelle), Will (Jason Ritter) and Tim (James Callahan) are out on the hunt for the secrets on why they've been drugged all these years and why the police are covering up all of these murders in Springwood. Things progress in an obvious fashion form there, but include many surprises along the way, keeping you entertained from start to finish.I'm actually starting to get a little p*ssed with everyone knocking the hell out of the script and dialogue. I just saw the film for a second time and am starting to feel like Freddy vs Jason is Matrix: Reloaded. At first, the script seemed a little cheeseballish, but the second time it made a little more sense. One of the best lines of the movie is a flashback (re-shot) of Jason's mother saying something along the lines of, ""I gave you the power to kill anyone, and never die!"" I love this because with this one simple line, everything I didn't understand about the previous ten Friday's, was explained. Another positive aspect are Freddy's lines, right out of a Nightmare on Elm Street flick, ""got your nose!"" Jason has some great dialogue as well... ha ha just kidding. The film was filled with great one-liners, and excellent storytelling, and even when a line was thrown out that didn't make sense, on a close look, it actually did. For example, there's a scene where everyone is sitting around a table brainstorming on what the situation is, all of a sudden they are understanding completely and it sounds rediculous. Then pops in Lori's line, ""Jason died in water, Freddy died in fire, how can we use this against them?"" While everyone was cracking up, I was paying more attention, if you give it a second, that entire sequence ends up being a dream sequence and Freddy is manipulating Lori. Some more good news, the line ""Freddy vs Jason, place your bets,"" is NOT in the movie, thank god! There was also a line you can watch out for, which I thought was really well said, Freeburg says something along the lines of, ""Start thinking outside the box, because this guy is breaking the fucking rules of reality!"" I can't remember the rest, but I remember liking what he said alot. There's even some grat jokes thrown out my Freeburg, after the rave scene he says, ""That dude in the goalie mask was p*ssed off!"" But seriously, even if you think dialogue is bad, do you see a horror movie for its highly intellectual and enriching plot and dialogue?
Delivery is key in a movie, and expecting the worst from a cheesy 80's horror flick, made these acting jobs seem golden. Jason Ritter would have made his daddy proud (John Ritter Bride of Chucky) and Katharine Isabelle ohhhh man! Anyone who knows me around here knows how much I absolutely love her, and many of you agree. Well here's some news you'll find exciting, Freddy vs Jason marks her nudeless debut! Speaking of the nude, while we're on the subject, Ronny Yu takes a stab early in the film at 80's horror flicks. He hits on almost every horror cliché' right off the bat, as a gag for die hard fans. They basically opened the movie with a bare chested model swimming in a lake, almost begging to die, classic! Anyways, back to the subject at hand, acting. What more could you want from Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund, interview here)? Robert Englund portrayed Freddy to the very best of his abilities and beyond. Freddy was sick, twisted, and darker than ever. Even within the realm of his jokes, you had chills down your spine from his wicked smile and sly remarks, this is truly the most twisted Freddy since the orginal Elm Street. As for Jason, I think I am the first person to understand Ronny Yus' envisionment of this ""new"" Jason Voorhees. When I compare Kane Hodder to Ken, I see Kane (no offense) as wider and larger, kind of a fatter Jason. While Ken is just as tall, if not an inch smaller, but yet is fit and sleek looking. He looks a lot more energetic and looks as if he poses more of a threat to Freddy than a thicker Jason (Jason fans, please don't kill me). All in all, this is the dawn of a new era of horror films.When I speak of a new era, I am talking about everything you every wanted in a horror film plus a directing job that's better than some of this big name Hollywood movies that have hit the big screen recently (ie. Spy Kids 3-D... ouch, don't ask why I saw it). Finally an 80's slasher flick filmed with the eye of a genius! Ronny Yu took my favorite film franchise, Childs Play, and just like a rubic's cube, reshaped it into the ultra fun Bride of Chucky, without breaking the laws set in the first three films. Yu does the same with Freddy vs Jason, he takes all of the cliché's and rules set from the Friday the 13ths and Nightmare on Elm Streets and blends it with his own vision of the pure evil that is Jason and Freddy. His camera shots and use of colors breathe new life into these icons lives. One example of his masterful camerawork is a shot of Jason walking out of a house. The camera pans left and then shift on a crane over Jason's head, looking straight down on him, giving a very unorthodox view of Jason. His use of close ups and medium shots are well placed and mixed very well. He opens the film with a close up of a disgusting Freddy mouth as Freddy speaks about the situation at hand, its very dynamic in a sense; he also uses some awesome close-ups of Freddy's evil eyes. Yus Freddy vs Jason is almost as precise as Gore Verbinski's Ring remake (review), when things are slow, you can always count on his brilliant camerawork and use of colors to keep you on the edge of your seat. Yu's uses of colors were magnificent, very reminiscent of Oliver Stone's work. His use of greens, blues, reds and yellows made me feel like I was watching something out of Natural Born Killers. The skies are a dark blue, while a house is laminated with the bright yellow lights on the side, only darkened at the door by the brightness, what lies behind these closed doors? The feelings you get watching some of his shots give me the creeps. During the cornrow scenes, Katherine Isabelle is wearing a bright red hat to compliment the green background. One last example is the first time Freddy and Jason face off, when Freddy is in advantage, the scenes are colored red, while when Jason takes over, the scene shifts to a green haze, only to be subdued by the color blue (you'll understand why when you see the film).
When I was reading the Fangoria's Freddy vs Jason special magazine, Ronny Yu was quoted as saying, ""I used the World Wrestling Federation as a model of what I was trying to do with the battles between Freddy and Jason."" I immediately freaked, thinking only of Blade 2 (review) and its ridiculous use of wrestling moves. After viewing Freddy vs Jason, I was very happy to see that nothing was used except for an elbow drop, which was used in a very funny way. The fight was incredibly well played out and shot. Freddy even goes Wolverine ""berserker"" style (X2) on Jason, clawing him like you've never seen before! The only thing that bothered me was how bad ass Freddy is in Freddy vs Jason vs how much of a complete pussy he was in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. The only explanation I could conjure up in my feeble little mind is that Freddy was being leanient on his daughter in Freddy's Dead, while Jason is really making him mad. Suspension of disbelief works fine to, the battle was unbeliveable!Another great area of the film was New Lines decison to hire a new score writer named Graeme Revell (Blow, Idle Hands) over the usual choice Harry Manfredini. The one thing I hated about Jason X (review) was the awful score. It was like I watching the Sci-Fi channel, and it didn't help any that the film took place in space! Revell knows what we need, and we need something simple, with quick cuts and a lack of cheese, finally some respect on the score, it's time to get with the times! New Line also did a fantastic job of not using the soundtrack (now avaliable from Road Runner Records) too much, it was mostly pure score.One last thing that makes this movie so friggin unbelievable is New Lines involvement in making Freddy vs Jason. I feel New Line has found the secret to the MPAA, and it's so obvious, it was right under our noses the whole time. From what I understand, the MPAA allows certain things if they are ""justified,"" or ""unbelievable."" For example, Mike Mendez's Convent (2000) was originally rated NC-17 because Nuns were killed in the movie, but soon after discovering that these Nuns were actually monsters, it became OK and the film received an ""R."" Now New Line possesses the secret and I'm going to share it with you right now... blood, lots of it, gore to the brim! They make movies so ridiculously bloody that the MPAA sees it as humorous and unbelievable. Remember how bloody Final Destination 2 (review) was? As you can now expect, Freddy and Jason ensue a blood bath only these two could make. New Line understands what the fans want, and we want BLOOD! From what I've read in interviews, New Line even told Ronny Yu to make Freddy vs Jason violent and bloody and he could make it, and this is toned down from what they wanted!Besides blood, we want fun. Freddy vs Jason delivers on all ends, and makes this movie complete. A well stitched plot, tons of blood, great acting, and one of the best horror directing jobs since John Carpenter's perfection, In the Mouth of Madness, make Freddy vs Jason my number three favorite horror movie of all time (behind Exorcist and In the Mouth of Madness).
Before I express my final thoughts, I want to point out a few things that bothered me or needed a quick mentioning. First, I'm sure you're all thinking about continuity errors, do they exist? The answer is no, this script seemed flawless to me on first viewing. The old scripts had some of the most moronic ways of returining these characters to the screen. One script has a reporter writing an article on Freddy and sent it all over the internet, thus spreading his legend to great proportions, releasing him from his imprissionment. Another script had Jason and Freddy revived during a sacrifice from a cult, very lame as half assed if you ask me. The problem New Line had was the longer they waiting, the more we expected, and they delivered! David Goyer and co did a fantastic job in making Freddy vs Jason take place after Final Nightmare and goes to Hell and keeping the storyline intact. If anything was done to the history at all, it would have to be that they filled in some old plot holes. Speaking of something I found disappointing, Spoiler when Freddy gets super p*ssed off, he sort of morphs into this super cynical looking Freddy; more demonic. Yu only places this in the film once, I guess for emphasis, but I really would have enjoyed more of this super Freddy. End Spoilers. I really loved how the past movies where summed up during the opening sequence. Yu shows only Freddy's mouth as he explains the situation at hand. The kills were fantastic, and very original. Last but not least, you will be EXTREMELLY happy when you see how Freddy causes Jason to dream (which we thought wasn?t really possible). I was also please with some of the plot that tied up loose ends in the past Friday films.When the credits rolled I was disappointed, why? Because I couldn't believe it was over already! The movie is over an hour and half long and it flew by so fast. I have been sitting in anticipation for this film since I was 13 years old and there I was, sitting with my feet sticking in spilled pop and my shirt filled with popcorn pieces wondering if this was just a dream? Had I really seen the impossible, the unbelievable, Freddy vs Jason? I wonder how long it will take for reality to sink in that the wait in finally over and now all I have to look forward to is Jeepers Creepers 2 (blech) and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.But my final thoughts are that if this were a serious movie, and I had not been a fan of Freddy or Jason, I'd probably give this film 3 out of 5 skulls, but I'm a fan boy, and this truly is a fanboys dream!
My final Plea to ALL of you: Now that I've completely analyzed the movie to shreds, get your butts into the theater this weekend, I don't want to read ANY excuses on the message board. I don't want to read, ""I'll wait for DVD,"" or ""maybe next weekend."" This movie is important to the future of the horror industry; this could make or break the next decade for us horror fans. If this movie makes the cash, we could see more studios taking risks of this caliber in the very near future, so for the sake of horror, GET OFF YOUR ASS AND GO SEE THIS FRIGGIN FLICK!Reviewed by Mr Disgusting",Freddy vs. Jason
578,rowbotfilms,The Main Event - Round One,10,21 August 2003,Its been a long wait...but it was well worth it.  Great storyline and plenty of gore.  All around great fun and humor.  The battle lines were drawn and people chose sides before the show.  Cheers and Boo's througout the movie. Reminds me of a main event of a big boxing match.  Round one done.  Can't wait for Round two.,Freddy vs. Jason
579,raymond_neal,Freddy vs. Jason is all it should be and more.,10,17 August 2003,"This movie is a lot of fun. It delivers on every level that it should, poking fun at the genre the whole time.  But the irony in this film is not the same as in ""Scream"" and those like it, with characters nudging and winking at one another and talking about ""the rules"". In Freddy vs. Jason, the characters play it straight and clueless, which magnifies the horror/slasher conventions for the audience because we instantly recognize what we're seeing and can enjoy the actors as they ham it up within the framework they've been given to work with. It works, and it's awesome.The film also delivers in the areas that matter most: gratuitous nudity and gore.  After years of watered down slasher/horror flicks, it's refreshing to finally get some good old fashioned gore splashing out at us from off the screen. Jason's first kill on Elm Street is brutal, and it gets even better. Freddy also does some great tricks, and let's thank the gods for CGI that can pull them off as good as they deserve to be.  From the opening credits onward, you know you're in for a bloody good ride.  The final smackdown sequences are kick ass and do not disappoint.After years of half-baked sequels and wannabe big studio slasher attempts, Freddy vs. Jason finally gives us what we've wanted all along.  It's like the 90s never happened, except the special effects are better and the director, writers and actors know how to let the audience have some real fun without being too obvious about it.",Freddy vs. Jason
580,IKP280,Don't Let Anyone Lie To You...This Movie Had it All,10,17 August 2003,"I'm fairly sure that by the time your reading this you have read a thousand other comments bashing Freddy vs Jason.  And if your one of those people that needs to find the poetic meaning of a movie through the haze of gunsmoke (*cough*Matrix*cough*) then don't go see this movie.  If however you are a horror fan or realize movies are ment to entertain not tell you how to live, THEN THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!  I was skeptical that they would be able to do this movie with out making it cheesy.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This movie had the best aspects of a Nightmare on Elm Street and a Friday the 13th with a decent story line to boot.  Granted its not the best plot ever to be inked but in all honesty for a horror film it was top notch.  Especially, compared to Elm Street Part 2 and the stinkers that were Friday Part 5 and 9.  The special effects were fantastically done and the CGI effects where tasteful and not over used.  Freddy has never looked so evil in a film to date. Robert Englund once again lives up to the character he has basically embodied.  Freddy has lots of great one liners and his ""quirky"" sense of humor is allowed to shine.  Ken Kirzinger does a good job being Jason and he should considering he helped on Part 8.  But Kane Hodder would have been far better for the part.  Kane just had a better presence that no other actor playing Jason has been able to match.  And like all good horror movies you get some decent random nudity and some very creative kills.  I will not go into any details concerning the movie because I don't wanna be that guy that ruins it for someone.  But the kills and body count does both series justice.  Some Freddy fans maybe dissappointed by his lower body count but the story of the movie explains why and its not that big of an issue.  Thankfully though, it seems the entire movie is building to the point where these two monsters go head to head.  Once they finally do go at it its like two trains hitting head on at 200 miles per hour.  The fight between Freddy vs Jason couldn't have lived up to expectations any better.  The final scenes of the movie are vicious and bloody; would you have it any other way?  Put all your fears to rest about the cast finding another way to defeat these titans any other way then letting them hack at each other.  As I'm sure many of you were, I've been waiting a long time to see this movie.  Since Friday Part 7 was supposed to be FvJ.  And truth be told I couldn't be happier with how this movie turned out.

581,metroidhunter,Waste of a whole hour.,7,16 August 2003,"The first hour of this movie was a waste.***SPOILERS***
Freddy discovers that he can't haunt the children's dreams anymore so he manipulates Jason into doing his dirty work.Jason realizes what is happening and turns on Freddy.Finally after an hour long wait the long-awaited battle between the two erupts.

582,D17,"Not solidly good, but not all that bad.",6,15 August 2003,"I wish I could write a full review, but I don't have the time now, so here goes...Freddy Vs. Jason is a long awaited horror film almost a decade in the making. One of the major delays has been a constant juggling of scribe duties... In short, none of the previous script versions was ""good enough."" In theory, that should mean that the final script is practically nothing short of awesome, but unfortunately, this is not the case here. There's a lot of exposition that's both badly written and unnecessary for the true Freddy and Jason fans, even those who've only seen one film from each series. The acting is very generic...for teen actors, which means it's doubly bad. Character development is like in most horror films... almost non-existent. The actors portray their roles like they seem to have distinct personalities, but the script prevents them from showing us who the characters really are, so we can't really care when they die. In a movie like this, that's a moot point anyway. Sometimes I found myself actually saying in my mind, ""Come on, give me more Freddy vs. Jason action!""Unfortunately, a movie that's entirely made up of one immortal monster battling another quickly turns boring, which is why we have as many scenes of non-horror as possible. That said, although the final duel is the best part of the movie, we the audience can hardly be satisfied at the movie's ending: Inevitably, since neither demon can die for good, they'll come back for more. No winning or losing for either side.There are also subplots like how jumpy the police are (though strangely, halfway through the film they never appear again), what really happened to the main girl's mother (who was killed by Freddy, even though she was A GROWN WOMAN...makes no sense) that are mere padding and don't add the main plot at all, which is, after all, Freddy versus Jason.I also noticed that a horror revolution seems to be taking place: These days, horror movies have become more and more stylized, like they want to pass themselves off as ""art"" movies. The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre looks to have this pretentiousness, and FVJ sometimes exudes it. There are multiple ""creative"" camera angles, a wider palette of grungy colors, more sex than all of the Freddy movies combined (the standard in horror these days), and more gore than I've ever seen in a slasher. The most annoying ""technique"" was the random insertion of a few frames of blurry slow-motion here and there, which I suppose is meant to increase the drama of a particular shot, but it's cliched now and merely distracting here.Still despite all these flaws, FVJ still has its charms. It is still the long awaited premise realized on celluloid, and can be decent entertainment. I've seen all the Freddy movies now and only one Friday movie (the first), but I can say that this movie is at least better than some of the Freddy sequels. #6 was the worst... nothing can come close to how bad that was. Then there was #2, which served no purpose whatsoever in the overall Freddy mythology, not to mention it wasn't very compelling, more like a dumbed-down horror movie for teens. FVJ stands at the middle of the Nightmare saga in terms of quality; read other reviews for how it stacks up against the Jason movies. Not solidly good, but not all that bad. 6/10, C.",Freddy vs. Jason
583,Jayman367,FREDDY VS. JASON,10,11 August 2004,"I was very impressed with Freddy Vs. Jason. As a huge fan of horror films I really thought director Ronny Yu did a superb job on showing the battles of the two legendary murderers. I really like both Freddy and Jason but personally I lean to like Jason Voorhees more. He being more of a mystery always interested me on what he was going to do next in his acts of killing and seeking revenge on the teenagers/adults that get in his way. Anyway, back to the film. Throughout the movie, it explains the lives of both Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees and was depicted quite well. As far as the acting it was okay at times but for the most part it was successful. The humor was called for at the correct times and it was depicted in the right way. The movie felt like a slasher/killer on the lose film which was a very great feel while watching the movie. And my favorite parts of all horror movies, the KILLS. Many of which were well done by both Freddy and Jason. If you looking for blood and dismemberment packed experience this is definitely the horror film to view, much bloodshed and body parts being sliced off just to remind you!! Considering I am a big fan of both the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm street series I obviously liked the film very much, some people that don't really care for the genre may think of it as just another movie where a killer is on the lose, their wrong. Even though everyone is entitled to their own opinion they should think twice. The movie was an excellent sum up of the two and finally showing their long awaited battle. The ending is my favorite part of the film. I really liked the way they did it, its a must see to find out who is victorious. Overall, Freddy Vs. Jason was an enjoyable film filled with LOTS of blood, humor, and the well executed kills. Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees had the brutal brawl in history with on-screen villains. Hopefully in the near future we will see more films of this nature with two legendary killers in a huge bloody battle to find out who is the true mass murderer.***SPOILER*** (READ ONLY IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE AND/OR WANT TO SEE WHO I THOUGHT THE WINNER WAS)-----------------------------------------------------------------------It really depended on where the two were. When Jason was in Freddy's territory, (which was the dreamland) Freddy had the advantage. When Freddy was in Jason's territory (which was the real world) Jason had the advantage. The final battle between the two was in the real world at Camp Crystal Lake. Freddy had many brutal attacks but Jason overpowered him on more occasions. In the end of the long battle between the two legendary murderers I would have to say Jason Voorhees is to be crowned victorious. He had the last attack on Freddy with stabbing him with Freddy's own weapon. (The glove with blades) As I said earlier, I really liked what happened at the conclusion of the movie. With Jason emerging from Camp Crystal Lake and holding Freddy Krugers severed head in his hand. Great Ending!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
584,dudeofthedead,A classic before it even hit the screen!!,8,24 August 2003,"I can't belive people are complaining about the bad acting, dumb story, and even worse directing when the movie is titled ""Freddy Vs Jason"". Hello folks, this is THE movie most horror fans have been waiting 10+ years for. And boy was it ever worth the wait. The last half hour alone is some of the best action I've ever seen in a film. The fights between the horror gods are nothing short of extrodinary. The gore is so over the top, I don't know how they even came close to an R rating. Look, if your reading the review to figure out if you want to see it, YOUR NOT A HORROR FAN, so don't go see this. Go watch ""My Boss's Daughter"" or ""Swat"" or something dumb like that.

585,JimmyHo,"By far, the most action packed horror movie of the modern era",8,17 August 2003,"And I'm not joking.  I've been watching the NOES and Friday the 13th series since I was 3, being a proud fan of the ""seriesed"" horror movies from then on.  I'm one of those crazy people who has been waiting for this moment ever since New Line bought the rights for Friday the 13th back nearly ten years ago.  I mean, c'mon kids, it was inevitable.When the choice was made to make Ronny Yu the director of this film, I shuddered...  Ronny ""I should be shot for making Bride of Chucky"" Yu.. BUT, to my utter shock, this movie deserves that 7.2 rating it has now.  There hasn't been a movie this fun and action-packed in years.  There's more blood and gore in this than Sam Raimi's unholy trilogy.For the few minor setbacks this movie unfortunately came across (Ken instead of Kane, the reputation of Ronny, etc.), the movie came off being the most original horror movie sequel, ever.  The story is outstanding, and the action even more so. No, I'm not going to repeat what every other person reviewing this movie has done, going into the plot of the movie, because, I'm tired of seeing the same things.  Impressive acting from the youngins, incredulous gore, and the greatest battle of the 21st century makes this something you should get off your computer, right this instant, and get your butt into a movie theather seat.  10/10... nothing less...(And hey kids, it can't be half bad if it made TEN times more on the opening weekend than Gigli.. haha..

Although predictable and similar to many others of the genre, they follow the conventions that audiences enjoy, and the ending is pretty special.  The introduction of the deputy, the guy from Scary Movie, provoked laughs every time he arrived on screen, and he wasn't even meant to be funny.  The strange logic that the teenagers make, working out almost immediately what Freddy is using Jason for seems a little presumptuous, but moves the narrative quickly, and there is not a lot of let up.  For all you guys out there, there is a lot of nice breastage on show from the opening scene, and also Katherine Isabelle gets 'em out in the shower.  In conclusion, although a little predictable, the gore levels are good, and seeing two screen legends kicking the s**t out of each other when we know they are almost invincible is classic.

People who have written negative reviews of this film, in my opinion, would never be pleased by a film of this nature.They consistently mistake self-referential comedy for cliche (e.g., all the fans laugh when the opening sequence has a girl getting naked and jumping in Crystal Lake while calling for her boyfriend, but the critics seem only able to think that they've seen it before) and make ludicrous complaints such as the ""Freddy vs Jason"" battle doesn't occur until the end of the film, (did anyone really want to see them fight for 100 minutes?) or that it is ""mean-spirited"" (how do you kill off dozens of innocent teens by a pair of maniacs without being a little mean?).The film carefully juggles both of the headliners, giving the fans plenty of vintage Friday the 13th slashing as well as Nightmare on Elm St eerie dream sequences. When the two finally come down to fighting the filmmakers don't disappoint, and both characters have their weaknesses and strengths exploited for the screen.Certainly less frightening, but more entertaining than anything in the last ten years from either series.

I wasn't sure if they were trying to be a parody like the one girl's character says. your 14 now when are you going to grow up? The actress has to be in her 20s. and how did the 2 escaped mental patients get new trendy clothes and walk around the halls of school without being noticed? Plot holes everywhere.

593,superboy072,The perfect merger of two horror classics.,10,15 August 2003,"Just when fans like me had given up hope that we would see a good horror movie ever again, someone thought up Freddy Vs. Jason. The kind of thing that we thought we could only dream about...or have nightmares about. But this was not so simply just a matter of ego, or th two randomly just deciding to kill each other. This was (for once) a horror movie with a good explanation. Recent horror movies like Halloween : Resurrection and Jason X have had more impressive death scenes than their predecessors, but haven't had the story to back them up. The humor in the movie is also a great plus. In my opinion, this was probably the funniest movie I've seen all summer. The ending had the entire theater cheering with pure delight. The death scenes were the most creative each series has ever featured. I have heard people complain that Jason was being played by somebody new, but this doesn't affect the movie at all. Jason is a character that wears a mask and who requires minimal acting experience. But Robert Englund returns as Freddy, and is better than ever. I expected disappointment, but left the theater with a smile on my face. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who has seen even just one of each other the series.",Freddy vs. Jason
594,Brkat02,too much Cheese?,5,15 August 2003,"i went in thinking it was going to be really cheesy, and granted it was really cheesy, but over all it still wasn't that bad, had some good laughs in it, and a few good places to reach over and scare the crap out of your neighbor if your paying attention...",Freddy vs. Jason
595,Kradle_of_Filth666,"Well worth the ridiculous prices movie theaters charge for tickets, popcorn and pop.",10,15 August 2003,"First off, I'd like to note that I'm lucky to have seen this movie on opening day. Living in Ohio, I was affected by the blackout last night (August 14th), so I was hoping I would be able to see it. Thankfully, I was. And boy, was it a good movie.(WARNING: SOME [MAJOR] SPOILERS AHEAD!!!)I should warn the fans of more serious horror movies: Freddy vs. Jason is NOT a very serious movie. Now, Freddy is as evil and as freaky as ever, but there's tons of gags and laughs throughout. From Jason cutting off Freddy's arms, Monty Python and the Holy Grail-style to a teenager throwing alcohol on Jason in an attempt to harm him to the ending(HUGE SPOILER!!!), where Jason walks away with Freddy's head, which winks at the audience, this movie does not take itself seriously at all.(END OF SPOILERS)But it's still a great movie, and well worth the ridiculous prices movie theaters charge for tickets, popcorn and pop. There are some stupid moments where Freddy or Jason get thrown 20 feet, traveling the distance in less than a second, but it's still an awesome time. Much of FvsJ is really scary. I recommend it completely. No, really. Go see it! Now!",Freddy vs. Jason
596,Revenge_of_The_Hammer,I never thought I'd say this....,3,16 August 2003,"Spoiler Alert But this movie is utter tripe. It SUCKS! I am a GIANT Jason fan, but this is absolutely idiotic. We jump into the movie with no real background given to the story. The acting is horrendous, that from Monica Keena in particular. Ken Kerzinger is a pisspoor replacement for Kane Hodder, the man who played Jason for the last four movies and who totally developed the character. Here's my list of pet peeves, of course, major spoilers ensue:I'm breaking this down into four sections, Jason, Freddy, other actors, and miscellaneous. Let's start with the biggest problem, Jason Voorhees.Ken Kerziner:First off, let me say that he DID surprise me. He was better than I expected. That said, he was still a major downgrade from Kane Hodder.
To start with, one thing that really annoyed me was the way he stomps around. Kane Hodder is a good twenty pounds heavier, Graham even more so, and you NEVER heard their footsteps ,especially that loud. How can you sneak up on someone with footsteps that go THWUMP, THWUMP?Equally, another thing that bothered me was his first kill. He stabs the guy, and for no f***ing reason, he keeps stabbing him. He doesn't act p***ed when he does this, he just keeps stabbing him up and down. Michael Myers stabs people repeatedly. Jason Voorhees usually stabs someone once and walks away to his next victim. This is a nono.Also, I hate the way he looks when his mother is talking to them. He puts his head on his chest and gets ""puppy dog"" eyes going. That looks like he's begging for a bone rather than acting sad.And when, praytell, was Jasons head so puny? His mask like swallowed his face up, and that's just not cool. And his mouth had a pathetic makeup job. I mean, it looks even less deformed than the way it was in 3 or 4, and by now Jaso's mouth should be MANGLED. But it's not.Another thing that annoyed me was how slow he moves. Yes, Jason usually walks pretty slow, but this guy was literally Frankenstine. He just pondered. Even whilst fighting Freddy in the final showdown, he just walks as if he were taking a moonlight stroll.Again, when did Jason become the Hulk? Jason usually shows feats of amazing strength, but bending a person in half or snapping a neck is FAR easier than, say, spearig a guy and hurling him for a God damned mile, or taking a multi ton boiler and just pushing it off of him, or punching Freddy in the air for seventy five feet. I like a strong Jason, but NOT one that comes straight from a comic book. It makes it feel too much like a comic.
Another problem is the way he just stands there when he has Everclear splashed on him. The Jason I know from parts 2-X would have snapped that guy in two and layed him out to dry before the liquid touched him. This guy not only just stood there when the water hit him, but he actually kinda ribbed the guy in his arm after snapping his neck like he was just joshing with him. Also, when he was on fire in that scene he just acted as if the fire was nonexistant. I dunno about YOU, but I think it'd be best he showed SOME sign he was actually sentient, and not just the Terminator in a hockey mask.
This is just the tip of the iceburg on Ken, I'd need a whole nother thread to cover what I disliked about him.AS for Freddy, my primary problem was that Yu didn't seem to know whether Fred was dark and evil or the Joker incarnate. In some scenes, he seems really vile and evil, but in others he's pinballing Jason complete with sound effects, f***ing a dead corpse, and winking and grinning after being beheaded. I'd prefer it if he were one way or the other.
Also, like with Jason, Freddy seemed to have become Batman. If he's able to elbow smash Jason, counter his swings, flip, jum over him, throw him, and such, why the hell is it that relatively puny martial artists like Rick or the blonde chick in Freddy's Dead are always able to kick his ass?
And how is it that, if he had no powers in the real world like it seemed, he was able to surbvive a decapitation?I also didn't like the little monologue he had in the beginning, where we see bits of his face and an eye and such. It's like something off of Law & Order or something.Other actors:Two words. Monica. Keena. Before, Chris from part 3 would be my nomination for worst actress. Well, not anymore. I love looking at the completely overacted expressions on her face when even the slightest little thing happens, and her annoying wimper that puts her up there with the likes of Mark Patton in terms of sheer... annoyingness.Believe it or not, Kelly Rowland was pretty good, but the guy who played Mark, or whatever the blonde psychos name was, COMPLETELY over acted. This is especially evident in the school when he rushes to Lori.Mainly, even more than Ken, Ronnie Yu simply got on my nerves. His style of cutting seconds out of a scene to make it jumpy was ineffective, pointless, and, to be blunt, annoying. I didn't really think he could do a worse job than he did with Bride of Chucky. Well, I was wrong. I actually got a headache in the scene where Freddy is in Loris house and kills her mom, because he keeps jumping around and skipping seconds of the frame. It was like Manhunters ending, only even more annoying. His choppy editing was even worse than the obvious 3D effects that look like crap in a VHS in FT13th part 3.It bothered me that there was no explanaton given to why Freddy turned into the demon dude, and it was even more annoying how, after it was all hyped up, we got to see about two seconds of it.The way Isabelle moans like a porn star in her sex scene.
BAD CGI. Especially in the scene where Jason twists a guys head, the Freddy worm, ESPECIALLY the Freddy worm, and the scene where Kia is killed. Jason X had better CGI with a much lower budget. Hell, a guy setting behind me today even said the Freddy worm looked like s**t.I'd actually rather watch Jason X. This may be a better made film, but Jason X was a HELL of a lot more entertaining.For a movie I've been waiting for 15 years, I was very disappointed. Not horrible, but far from the best in either series. 4/10.
But, I'm not the only one.",Freddy vs. Jason
597,Revenge_of_The_Hammer,An Absolute Joke,3,9 September 2003,"Freddy vs. Jason has been nearly two decades in the making, since Friday the 13th part 7: The New Blood. Fans have waited, clamored for this film; and anticipation for this was doubled when Freddy made a quick appearance at the end of Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday. So why do I feel so cheated?This movie is all visceral thrills and NO chills. It doesn't even TRY to attempt horror; if you thought Jason X was cheesy, look out for this. Freddy hits off of a bong, literally played ping pong with Jason, has sex with a dead corpse whilst spewing the horrendous line ""I can't help it this b***h is dead on her feet!"". Freddy isn't much toned down here than he was in Freddy's Dead {which isn't saying anything}.Jason has been totally trainwrecked. Instead of standing around looking like a sad little toddler when he found out Freddy was tricking him, he should have been consumed with unholy RAGE, especially since Krueger was using his beloved mother! Where was the rage Kane Hodder made so famous for the character? This is the most disappointing Jason performance in history, and second worst, only behind CJ Graham.After viewing Wes Cravens New Nightmare the night I saw this, I expected an actual intelligent HORROR film. I got a braindead action/comedy.This is the second worst entry in both series, behind Friday the 13th part 3 and The Dream Child, respectively.3.5/10",Freddy vs. Jason
598,livewire_13,"Fun to watch, but not for the serious movie goer",4,15 August 2003,"Well, this was no surprise. Freddy versus Jason is a movie that requires about ten brain cells to watch and is gorey beyond belief.  However, if you're looking for a laugh or something to do, go watch it.  Despite what Englund says about that lack of joking in it, every other sentence out of Freddy's mouth created a roucous out of the crowd.  Also, most of the movie's ""scary parts"" come from characters backing up into Freddy or Jason.But, it's still kinda fun to sit their and get brain dead.  Definitely a fan favorite and worth seeing once.",Freddy vs. Jason
599,GavinBoseraffe,This movie went beyond expectations,9,17 August 2003,"I'll admit, watching the trailer for this movie had me excited and also a little worried.  I was afraid the new Jason couldn't live up to the legacy of Kane Hodder.  However... THIS MOVIE ROCKED!  They did it perfectly, mixing the brutality of Friday the 13th with the dark comedy of Nightmare on Elm St.  The plot was perfectly done, mixing the two stories together. Robert Englund may be getting old (In an interview he said he was experiencing arthritis and referred to himself as ""geriatric Freddy"") but he's still got it.  And Ken has my permission to play Jason as much as he wants... unless Kane comes back, of course :)",Freddy vs. Jason
600,Flying_Seizure_Robot,PURE CRAP!!!!! And yet it was entertaining...,8,7 September 2003,"I've seen some dumb movies before, but this is just dumb beyond belief. I mean it's the same as all the other Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th movies. Chop, chop, slash, slash. We don't give a darn about the characters. (except Freddy and Jason of course) There's just so much blood and gore it's hillarious. I was cracking up every time some one was killed. And maybe that's why I enjoyed this film. It's just one of those movies that you can just sit back, relax, and laugh everytime some poor kid gets scliced up. Don't expect this movie to change your life, or have some deep meaning. It's a movie, you should really just relax.",Freddy vs. Jason
601,blackroseMD1,This Movie Rocked!!,10,26 August 2003,"After waiting for years, I went and saw this movie on it's second day of release and I must say I was not disappointed. From the first notes of the familiar ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" Theme to the action packed, explosive final fight everyone in the theatre was cheering and rooting on their personal favorite. After reading all the bad reviews of this movie by the critics prior to it's release, this movie did something else I hoped it would, topped the box office. I recommend this movie to everyone.",Freddy vs. Jason
602,N_Malik87,Freddy and Jason under the microscope!,8,21 January 2004,"If you thought potboiler horror movies were on the decline your couldn't be more wrong.Despite being exterminated(?)over a decade ago Mr Krueger and Mr Voorhees are back and do they raise hell?. Yes they do with blood drenched machetes, terrified teenagers, pitch-black atmosphere, and not to forget the heavy metal background score.The plot? Fragile Freddy recruits Jason to strike fear in the hearts of the Elm street brat-pack and slaughter them without mercy, but progressively envious Freddy turns against Jason. Although at times 'Freddy Vs Jason' seems like a re-hash of the previous 17 or so installments, but its originality is the idea of combining the two horror legends with contrasting physical appearance,personality,and many other attributes. Remember double the evil will quadruple the fear for both the audiences and fellow cast members!.At times its diffucult to classify the genre of the film horror/slasher/comedy/fantasy/action/thriller the reason behind this is director has combined the lot to appeal to the broadest mainstream horror movie audience.One of the most entertaining scenes in the film is the clash between Freddy and Jason although full of red fluids and gore it seems like a scene from any Van Damme/Schwarzenegger/Chuck Norris films!Although a sequel might be in the pipeline but if you've been starving for horror entertainment 'Freddy Vs Jason' is a must. Once again the classic glory days of the 80's are being revived. Well done to the cast and crew for reliving the nostalgic horror and not attempting enforce the the Matrix-style post 2000 effects.Not a all-time classic by any means but still a must for the occasional horror fan! 8/10!!!",Freddy vs. Jason
603,SaltRiverNative84,The Most Dramatic Horror Movie Ending Ever!,10,3 October 2003,"I have to say that this was the best film that I have ever seen in years! It is really nice to know that the powers that be did not forget about the two villians that help upgrade the horror genre. Freddy vs. Jason was something that many of us hardcore horror fans have been waiting for and it did not fail to surprise me. The film gives a big salute to both the Freddy and Jason films. To bring these two together and give not just the chance of them working together but to give them the ultimate battle in which both they and we deserve. A good long gory battle that was full of buckets of blood that brought both of these men to this point. It was the most dramatic horror movie ending I have ever seen. I want to also say that I am really greatful to see FREDDY KRUEGER back on the big screen again, and to see him in a sence tipping his hat to his fans at the end of the film. Thank you ROBERT ENGLUND.",Freddy vs. Jason
604,paranoidandyroid,Not to Shabby,8,11 February 2004,"I walked into this film expecting to see one of the worst films my eyes would ever see.  Turns out I was wrong.  Not only was I wrong, I was pretty far off (House of the Dead proved that).  I'm not saying that this is the best horror film of all time either.  It was just...good, you know?  They did a great job on the film and made it as good as it could possibly get. The characters were not over or underdeveloped.  There was plenty of deaths (over 20), plenty of blood, and both Jason and Freddy looked pretty damn sharp.  The final fight scene was too long or too short, it was just right and it was pretty brutal.  I did like this film.  I would definately recommend it.",Freddy vs. Jason
605,wolfybl,Not what i expected,5,11 February 2004,"Although, i have never seen the series for either of these 2 serial killers, i was interested in the movie. i have seen parts of their movies, as well as seen Jason X twice and another Friday the 13th movie as well. Robert Englund was superb as Freddy Kruger, the guy who kills people in their dreams. Ken Kirzinger could have made a more convincing Jason, which leads me to doubt some parts of the movie. However, the other characters are wisely chosen, although they deaths are not as scary as they could be. not to mention the fact, that my brother, who is a huge fan of Freddy, does not recall the 2 boys from the mental institution, being in any of the other Freddy movies. i intend to find this out for myself. but in the meantime, if you enjoy a good kill now and then, this movie is definitely one that you should watch, especially on Friday the 13th.",Freddy vs. Jason
606,moonbb23,True to form for Freddy Kruger,3,18 February 2004,"This movie would have been very entertaining if it hadn't been laced with sex scenes and nudity. The suspense was riveting, and the plot was easy to follow. An unexpected visitor from the past made the movie much more enjoyable. I liked the introduction, it was very informative about Kruger's life before he was killed.",Freddy vs. Jason
607,snuggle,I'm crying,5,18 May 2004,"I saw Friday the 13th: A New Beginning when I was five years old. I saw my first NOES I believe within a year. Naturally you could expect a boy of six to fixate on an ultimate battle between the two (something I never have let go of). Over a decade later, somebody with enough Hollywood thrust thought it would be a good idea to make it into a movie. I'll take a stab at what happened. The bean counters saw how well Jason X did and made sure this movie would only be green lighted if it had a broader appeal. Matrix style fighting, pop stars, and character bastardization are just some of the noteworthy compromises. Don't be misled by the official categories. In making this accessible to all walks of mediocrity, it's become a mediocre attempt at comedy.There aren't any more words for this. Maybe I can stop sulking long enough to get a pizza and pretend the topping is teenage soul.",Freddy vs. Jason
608,super_nice_56,A blood bath of pure fun (Spoilers Ahead),10,17 July 2004,"I dunno if this will count as spoilers but just in case SPOILERS AHEAD!Freddy vs. Jason Two horror icons going at each other in an all out bloodbath. What more do you want?. Now for those who have seen the movie you by now the acting for crap for the ages. Will (Jason Ritter) part is played so poorly you can almost laugh. I of course did. Then there is Lori. The girl that's suppose to be this pure warrior that can take down evil. Yet she ware the mother of all push-up bra's and tightest whitest top. Yes, Ronny Yu wanted to get across that she has big breast and did a damn good job at it. Over all Freddy vs. Jason was an idol of all horror lovers. Whatever side you were rooting for. In addition, if you are like me and cannot live without B.G.G (Blood, guts and gore) this is essential movie to add to the slasher flicks you already own. The deaths were well done and the camera angels were just beautiful. And the blood didn't look half bad for a slasher flick taking into consideration that Friday The 13ths did not always have the best blood. Of course, Robert England gives a great performance as Freddy, the sick undertone of this movie. And Ken Kirzinger as the blood spiller Jason. Both played great roles and gave impressive performances in this movie. Robert England has always had a nack for playing Freddy Krueger in all his Nightmare On Elm Street film. He has always had that malevolent feel to him. And Ken Kirzinger played the Jason we all thought he should act like. A dumb moving killing man with no real life, good-old Jason. Even if most people think its easy to act without talking they are wrong. I give Freddy Vs. Jason 3 out of 5",Freddy vs. Jason

Bad cast, worst acting, blood looking like ketchup, plot that a 12 year old could come up with.how come Jason always walks, the victims are running like Tim Montgomery and he manages to kill them in few minutes? the Olympic games are getting closer, get Jason a free spot.",Freddy vs. Jason
610,dy-8,Nice Fight.. Rather boring Story..,4,25 October 2004,"Well if the movie would have concentrated more on the ""fight"" of Freddy and Jason and getting a more complex, psychological ""deepness"" to it then it might have become a great movie, because in the scenes where the two face off it gets really great, intense and fun to watch.But the story of the movie with the typical teenagers who once again get terrorized by Freddy Krueger is just too boring and doesn't surprise at any point.But hey, the fight between Freddy & Jason: Awesomely cool! I wonder, if we will see more face-offs between 2 bad guys like ""Freddy vs. Jason"" and ""Alien vs. Predator"" in the near future.. I think it would be cool. What about: ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" or ""Darth Vader vs. Ralph Nader""? haha- no just joking. I don't have any good ideas right now - but maybe some great Hollywood story-writer may have a good one?",Freddy vs. Jason
611,zackglennie,"If you don't mind it's not being scary, this is all right",7,23 December 2004,"I'm not a Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street fan. I think they're horror movies. This Freddy vs. Jason is not one.Freddy vs. Jason has a unique opportunity in that it can showcase superhero action without having a hero, just two villains. And they can whomp on each other indefinitely, because both are super-durable, limited only by the storyboarders' creativity. So what you see is cool! Maybe the previous movies from these series have made viewers squirm, hoping that a sympathetic couple can somehow survive the scourge. There is no such emotional tension in Freddy vs. Jason, because no character can jerk our tears.When a splatter film can make monsters the object of the violence instead of people, it can deliver violence without consequences. It's fun! I like a good scary movie, and I can also appreciate a good splatter-flick. They're different things completely. As a splatter picture, Freddy vs. Jason is great!",Freddy vs. Jason

613,thegingerfish,Not a very good movie,3,18 February 2014,"I thought at first this was an amazing idea. Not just one but two of them in one movie. I grew up watching Friday the 13th and Nightmare on elm street. I fought, there is just no where to hide in this. Not only are you in a lot of trouble when you're a sleep but you're in a lot of trouble when you're awake. I also wanted to see the fight to the death between these two.After watching 95% of this movie and characters that just didn't really connect with the movie were all killed of they eventually decided to give us the fight we was waiting for between Freddy and Jason. It wasn't an amazing fight but so far the only decent part of the show. In the end he stabs him and then he stabs him back and 50 stabs later the girl is the one to deliver the final blow. Or so we thought. Jason casually walks out of the water (which he is suppose to be terrified off) and then Freddy gives us all a little wink. Coming to the conclusion that the entire movie was now irrelevant because no one won or lost.That would have been bearable had the other 95% of the story been mildly interesting but it wasn't. Rather simple concept really, in his dreams Freddy wins in real life Jason does. In Freddy's dreams all he has to do to win is blink however in real life where Jason is basically invincible with super strength, Freddy is just a standard person with no abilities who dies like the rest. Yet there he is kicking Jason's ass ?",Freddy vs. Jason
614,dan123211,Hilariously awful,4,3 September 2018,"The film is pretty terrible, the plot is set aside just to see Freddy and Jason massacre a group of stock, forgettable teenagers, the acting is mediocre and the dialogue is corny as hell and it's absolutely hilarious because of it",Freddy vs. Jason
615,ruanrsc,Fans of both franchises should be satisfied with this movie,5,20 November 2019,"The movie begins with a very well done epilogue of freddy telling his origin and what happened after his last appearance. It is a very well built scene that brings us a nostalgia of the old films, enhanced by the colors in the scene.
Just then when we have Jason's apparition, it's pure Friday 13th! naked woman, jason killing naked woman, jason killing young having sex, Jason at his best.
Unfortunately in the 2nd act the quality of the film drops a lot. They are characters that are not introduced properly, others with very little or almost no development, some that only appear to die and others that could even be promising, but the script discards. The focus of the narrative becomes the main character and the drama is sooo boring, not to mention that what it comes down to is looking scared if the whole movie.
The kills are not very elaborate and also have very little gore and that's a great shame because the "" a nightmare on elm street"" franchise has the best kills I've ever seen in the movies.
Their fight in Jason's nightmare must split opinions, the freddy portrayed in the movie so far was relentless, serious and scary and here he is nothing serious (which was a problem in some franchise films like freddy's dead).
When the movie comes in the last act the quality goes up again and the final confrontation of the two is sensational! Lots of blood, limbs being severed, everything a duel between the two deserved.
The movie starts and ends well, what spoils is the crumb (we're talking about 1 hour). Pleases fans, but I don't think the general public should be very pleased.",Freddy vs. Jason

I saw the movie and I was happy to somewhat feel elements from the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the Friday the 13th.Overall, the movie was okay...and the ending was definitely let open for a sequel but I was letdown by the ending though because I really wanted to know who was better but I  guess you couldn't kill either of themn off...it might be too damaging to the franchise.It has some good death scenes.

618,upstart78,Clash of the Titans,10,20 August 2003,"Fans of the genre have been waiting for this ""Clash of the Titans"" for decades and it doesn't disappoint. The story is your standard horror/slasher fare but it does a decent job of telling how/why the gruesome twosome left/came back. Forgetting about the plot and the lame characters in the movie (for which they compensated by having all the women in the movie have really huge breast), fans will watch this only for Freddy and Jason. Freddy is as usual, the perverted and burned freak that spouts one-liners more than Arnold and gave me nightmares as a child. Now he's been upgraded to a freak who knows kung fu. You definitely have to see it to believe it. Jason, though smaller in size (Kane Hodder is a monster compared to this guy) is still the menacingly silent killing machine. When the two are fighting on the screen, its hard not to root for your favorite. The winner is clear, but the ending leaves room for a sequel (YES!!!). Long story short, lots of boobs, beer, sex, blood, guts, and gore with our favorite supernatural killers. The only flaw is that the movie leaves you wanting more...",Freddy vs. Jason
619,bluesjunky74,I really wanted to like it ...,3,18 August 2003,"For some reason, despite knowing better, I have retained somewhat of a sentimental attachment to the Friday the 13th series. As a kid I really loved these movies and even today, years later, I find myself still interested when I hear a new one's coming out (I thought Jason X might be good campy fun. Instead I found myself wishing Jason could have somehow come through the screen himself and put me out of my misery. I wouldn't have cared how bloody and painful my death would have been, either. As long I would have never known of such a thing as ""Uber-Jason,"" it would have been worth it). So, naturally, when I heard this one was coming out, I got kind of interested. There's potential there. A battle of two of the most prolific slashers of the eighties (are we still in the eighties? Oh wait, that's right. We're in a new century now), laying it all on the line to help fulfill our nation's love of death and violence. It might have been fun. The thing is: I only wish I was ten again.Don't get me wrong, I'm no film snob or anything, but this flick was doomed right from the first over-acted and overdone scene. If Freddy's little rant about child killing and Jason's mother intervention were supposed to give me the chills, well, it didn't. All it did was make me realize how much my friend was going to hate me for having talked him into to seeing this one (""hate's"" a pretty strong word, but he certainly wasn't thrilled).I think this movie would have been a lot better if none of the characters had talked. A big problem with these modern horror movies is that all of the young characters are so totally unlikeable. In the producer's hurried attempts to create ""hip"" and ""cool"" and ""modern"" kids, they forget to add any depth to the mix, so what you end up having is a bunch of clumsy robots who mechanically advance the scene from one to the next, occasionally throwing in some snappy line of dialogue that's supposed to make us laugh (not scream). But it's all terribly forced. Not to mention the ""emotional"" moments are totally soap-operaed out and melodramatic. I really hated all these young people (Except maybe the ""dorky"" guy. I love outcasts). Really, who cares if they get killed?I won't get into the plot too much. I'm sure everyone is familar with it by now, but if you're not, I don't want to spoil anything. I will say this, though: I did think it was funny how quickly all of our magical young characters (many big breasted, ala Russ Meyer) picked up on the situation. I mean, I realize these movies aren't very plausible to begin with, but dead serial killers channelling each other from hell, is that supposed to be an easy pill to swallow? Not for them, apparently. They were down with it in seemingly a matter of mintues. Also, the direction was over-stylized: too many slow mo shots. It got old in a hurry. And all the regular genre staples were there as well. I.e., young annoying people walking down a heavily hedged street and suddenly being a grabbed by, no not the killer but by a friend, how terribly shocking! This movie did have a couple entertaining scenes, though. I'm not going to totally brutalize this one. It was better than Jason X. The problem was everytime the picture finally seemed to be gaining momentum it got bogged down by another ""emotional"" scene or something devastatingly cheesy (Like Freddy talking). It was never able to sustain anything cool. By the time it got to the final showdown, I just didn't care. I was too busy thinking about the things I didn't like about Freddy vs. Jason. And, unfortunately, there were a lot of such things.3/10P.S. I thought a tag team death match featuring Jason and Michael Myers on one side and Freddy and Leatherface on the other might be interesting. Maybe they could get Spielberg to direct it or something.",Freddy vs. Jason
620,pbb333,Freddy Kruger & Jason Voorhees fight for who stays killing & who goes chilling.,10,9 July 2006,"this movie in my opinion was well thought out. the plot guided a sincere interest throughout the film. the use of suspense and blood kept me entertained. the very idea of having two horror icons fight an agonizing gory death made me want to watch it over and over and over again. i also liked the ending. I'm am mostly talking about how the two battled all night and ended up in the lake. then hours later Jason walks out carrying two things, his machete, and Freddy's head. in my opinion, there should be a sequel!!! also the director, Ronny Yu is amazing. IF there should be a sequel, he should be in for the job. and keep, Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger.",Freddy vs. Jason
621,JasonKrueger13,Hell Of A Movie,10,12 October 2006,"I could not wait until this movie came out. When i saw it, I loved it. I loved the battle of 2 legendary slashers. In this movie, they brought back hypnocil. Freddy Has Been forgotten by the people of Springwood. Freddy is stuck in hell and needs help. He uses Jason Voorhees to install fear in Springwood. As Jason kills more, Freddy gains more. When Freddy gets Jason to sleep, the real fun begins. Any horror fan should see this film. Freddy is still being played by Robart Englund and Jason is played by Ken (don't know how to spell his last name). Jason does win at the end. After Freddy and Jason battle at Crystal Lake. Jason rips off Freddy's arm and Freddy cuts off Jason's fingers. You'll have to see the movie to enjoy it. This is a 10/10 star movie.",Freddy vs. Jason
622,Dr_Pwn,Unbelievable,1,31 October 2006,"How.... In the WORLD..... unless your on heavy drug use or something..... can you give this movie ANYTHING more than a 2. I thought this was a joke when it was first coming out. Turns out it was. I want to talk to anyone (over 16%!?!?) who gave this movie a 10. Seriously. Come to my frigging house. Not only does it have the worst plot, characters, script, and direction, but its the dumbest idea of ALL TIME. Unbelievable. I like Friday the 13th (or at least some of them). I also like A Nightmare On Elmstreet (just the first one, I don't like it when horror movies such as these put out more than a few films). However, just as Alien vs. Predator was a stupid idea, this is even worse. The makers of these films cannot milk them forever. I can honestly see there being a Jason or Freddy movie being released 25 years from now. I don't know how this got a six, or how anyone gave it a 10 besides a gore-obsessed 7 year old, a drug addict (although i honestly cant think of a drug that would make you want to do such a thing), or the makers of this movie. Please, I BEG OF YOU, no more.",Freddy vs. Jason
623,moonlightknights,"Some small problems, but alot of fun",8,14 August 2003,"I saw an early screening of Freddy vs. Jason last night and I was very happy.  The movie is an almost no stop gore fest, lots of decapitations. As a bonus, there's almost a story there too.  The writers did a great job combining the 2 characters and staying true to the previous movies.
I read another review saying that Freddy wasn't funny enough.  That's true, if you really like Nightmare 5 and 6, and the cheese that goes into those movies.  I thought Freddy was TOO goofy in the movie.  Not overly so, but there is a pinball gag that is a little dumb.Jason was the menace that he always is.  And balanced with Freddy he was even better.  However, I saw nothing about this new guy that Kane Hodder couldn't have done.  It seems sad that the one man who became famous playing Jason couldn't do...for seemingly no reason.The highlight of the movie is obviously the head to head, F vs. J.  Far better than I expected.  Really its 2.5 fights and each one better than the one before.It's not great, some of the dialogue is bad, some of the acting is bad, some of the plot is bad....but as horror movies go, it was FAR above average, and the battle that we all want to see does not disappoint.
I'm ready for the rematch.  8 out of 10",Freddy vs. Jason
624,matthewobrecht,Great idea,6,21 September 2020,"It was neat see some of the Horror Icons fight each other, could have been done a little better, but to be honest if your fan for Freddy and Jason, you'll appreciate it. That's it, not a top 10 or anything, just fun to watch.",Freddy vs. Jason
625,ElfMageCin,Enjoyable,7,16 August 2003,"Quite frankly, it was enjoyable. Much better then the last Freddy and Jason movies and watching them fight was just great. A real thrill.

626,PeaJay18,Back To The Oldschool...,8,16 August 2003,"It's been a long time coming, but FvJ is worth the wait. I turned up to the film expecting to be disappointed, but am glad to report that it delivers almost everything a fan of these 2 icons could want. Right from the opening notes of the Elm Street theme blending into Friday 13th's ""Ch-ch-ch Kill-kill-kill"" sound effects, I felt like a kid again. My one fear for this movie was that it would suffer too much from post-modern irony and be too self-deprecating, but it treats the history of these characters with respect whilst having some fun at their expense. (""That goalie was p****d about something..""- a classic line.)Overall a nice mix of new ideas, but plenty of old school touches - boobs, drugs and buckets of blood. Probably the most blood I've seen outside an early Peter Jackson flick. (The opening credits set the tone, with a ton of blood splattering on a wall to reveal the title)I also liked the slight re-invention of the characters - Freddy still funny, but scarier than he's been in the past, and Jason given a more Mountain man look. Although I was initially wary of Kane Hodder not playing Jason again, the new Jason works well - the height advantage making him look cooler whilst maintaining the same movement style as Kane.Overall, if you're a fan of either franchise, you were probably at the front of the queue and will get a lot out of it. The real proof will be to see how it goes down with the not-so-hardcore fans..",Freddy vs. Jason
627,schoolgirlcaro,A very brilliant movie...,10,27 November 2006,"I have seen the movie ""Freddy vs. Jason"" for now...8 or 9 times, I think so...! Most of all I liked the fight scene in the fodder silo between Jason and Freddy, because Jason try to shut down his emotions in all the movies. But in the scene in which he is under the water-jet you can see that Jason is afraid like a little child, I think. (He trough his knife away!) But when you think over you can see the reason... So Jason died in the year, I think 1957, as the age of eleven... HE WAS A LITTLE CHILD AND HE WAS DIFFERENT! So I said my favourite scene and now my very unlicked once... I hate the scene in which Lorie dream ed that she is in the Crystal Lake and see how the kids pushed Jason in the water... She ran to him and call his name while she hold her hand to him, and than he came to the water surface and she screamed and went back...!!!! She does not help him...she could but she did not do anything, she is only sitting there and scream... But Jason won...",Freddy vs. Jason
628,thekennhope,Real Nightmare,3,21 May 2021,"My rating is three: one for Jason, one for Freddy, one for making every boy's dream come true. I'm talking about that childish thoughts on ""what if Freddy fights Jason, who would win?"". However, this idea was ruined by awful plot. I'd rather watch them fighting each other for hour and a half. Oh wait, I can do this in Mortal Kombat game...",Freddy vs. Jason

630,qortnir,Could've used more work on the characters,7,17 September 2021,"I'll say that the film definitely gets the friday the 13th vibe correct but not the nightmare one.

632,Impulsion,Much better than I expected...,10,17 August 2003,Although this isn't exactly Nightmare on Elm Street 7..if it was I would consider this to be the best of the bunch.There is more action and entertainment in this than the other 6 put together.,Freddy vs. Jason

I'd been a fan of both The Nightmare on Elm St and Friday the 13th films since I was a child, and my girlfriend never saw any of them. We both loved it! It's good at doing a re-cap without getting too boring, since it covers the ground in a new way, and covers things we never saw about the characters in past films.It's scary, but the main attraction is the character interaction. If you like horror, see this flick!",Freddy vs. Jason
635,JJAlexander,Non-Stop Gore,10,15 August 2003,"EXCELLENT FLICK! I just returned home from the premiere, and I have to say that this movie is a complete horror masterpiece. While I wasn't phased by the spooky ""jump at you"" shots and hacking galore, people like my girlfriend were constantly jumping out of their seats. This movie had everything...Reprised origins of both characters, ""home field advantage"" scenes for Freddy & Jason, Freddy's corny one-liners, Jason's elaborate murders, and of course a load of underage drinking, drug usage, and premarital sex to show that this film would stay true to its predecessors. Though I was just a slight bit dissatisfied with the ending, it worked for this particular movie and I could easily see a separate franchise of its own spawn from it in the future.",Freddy vs. Jason

My expectations were pretty low (the last 3 ""Friday's"" blew, as did the last 3 ""Nightmare's""), but my expectations were exceeded greatly with this movie.  First off, the film looked GREAT!  The cinematography and the way it was shot was very cool.  Secondly, the film was truly funny (and it was intentional).  Third, the killings were not that creative, but there was a lot of blood and killing (making these 2 villains scary once again).  And finally, the battles between Jason and Freddy were AWESOME!  I have not had this much fun in a ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie in a long time.  Way to go everyone involved!",Freddy vs. Jason

Its worth the 9 bucks to see it.  But whatever you do, don't see Gigli.",Freddy vs. Jason

It has everything, violence, gore, sex, drugs, rock music, humor, and two of the greatest horror icons of all time going at it.  It is incredible to see Freddy and Jason get thrown about like a rag doll by the other.  I didn't care who won, I just did not want this movie to end.  We need another one.  As long as they can make sense of it, and don't start throwing in every horror icon there is(Please no Chucky!) it will be awesome.

I looooved when Freddy was torturing Jason in his dream. And I looved when Freddy was kicking his ass in the real world.

641,nathandetroit23,Massive Disappointment....,4,12 March 2009,"From the horrendous acting to the awful dialogue...to the fact Freddy and Jason never teamed up at any point, to the fact Kane Hodder didn't even get to wear the hockey mask...this movie was one mess after another. It happens to be one of my most anticipated movies of my life. Being a huge Fthe13th fan and modest Elm Street fan I looked forward ever since freddy's glove snatched jason's vacant mask and laughed into movie oblivion at the end of 'final Friday' in 1993. I thought the makers of this film would realize that the greatest strength of any team up movie would be to have both of them team up and slay stupid teens and actually be kept in darkness and shadows and deliver scares...but no...not to be....We instead got a 'Hollywoodized' film that grabbed some of the worst actors I've ever seen (destiny child's rowland!!) and turned into into a teen drama with minimal scares or freddy dream sequences. Robert Englund looks embarrassed at times to be a part of this garbage and considering he starred in elm street 2,4,5,6.. thats saying a lot!The main culprit was that greedy producers prevented this movie from being made when it would have been its most impactful, the late 80s heyday of 13th and Elm street...But then again these were the same producers who after 13th part 4 and elm street 3 decided to minimize the scares and maximize the camp..not surprisingly the profits went down along with the scare level..If this movie had been made in 1988 when it was supposed to have been made, you would have had Hodder vs Englund, that nostaglic 80s horror vibe, possibly some actual scares, and the profits could have led to more teamup films that had quality. Myers from Halloween before Busta Ryhmes and Zombie. Or maybe Pinhead before his straight to DVD career. Maybe Chucky before the woefully embarrassing bride of chucky/seed of chucky. Can you think of the one liners chucky and freddy could have sent at each other in a chucky dream sequence...Can any horror fan just think of how great that could have been??As Freddy says in the movie ""welcome to my nightmare..""He couldn't have been more right............",Freddy vs. Jason
642,killerfever,Not Bad,8,19 June 2009,"Well, I wouldn't say it was the best but it sure as hell wasn't the worst. I found this movie to be pretty good actually. Ronny Yu was a great director, maybe a little pushy a times, but he made it work. A lot of my friends had given me crap about having this movie on my shelf but I tend to ignore them. I'm a true F13 and NoES fan and I absolutely love Freddy and Jason and this match was a match made in heaven...to fight and rip each other apart that is! I love that they kept Robert, the original Freddy for all the Nightmare movies, and allowed him to once again put on the claw. He needs it. It's what defines him in my opinion. I also love that they used the original Jason's stunt double, Ken, for the actual part this time. He has the experience! I was actually starting to get impatient when I learned about how many scripts went through the system before they finally settled on this one, and even as the movie was going, the script was still being edited. I'm glad the guys could make it work. My rating: 8/10",Freddy vs. Jason

It was crap. Jason is a giant,(Spoiler) Freddy's kill count is 1 or 2, whereas Jason's if around 20. Jason is suddenly afraid of water for no reason (spoiler), the acting is terrible, the dialogue is crap, and the gore/blood effects are weird. Instead of having blood seep from a wound like it should it sprays all over the place. The director in an interview on the FvJ website said he used comedy than instantly hit you with horror, I am 12 years old and I did not find humor or fright anywhere in this movie, he also said that he shouldn't re-invent anything, but as i said earlier (spoiler) Jason is just suddenly afraid of water when in many Friday the 13ths he has voluntarily walked into crystal lake(spoiler).

646,zombieattack85,WOW,10,16 August 2003,"All i can say is WOW. Being a huge horror fan (mainly) slasher films, this movie definitly was a pleasing experience. The killing scenes were fantastic and really brought back the good 80's horror feel again with a nicely updated look to it. By that i mean it didnt look TOTALLY fake. The story was great and the movie really explained itself well without you sitting in your seat thinking about what just happened. The visuals are superb and its really a great horror atmosphere throughout the movie. Freddy is top notch with his witty sense of humor and Jason is sicker then ever with his brutal way of handling his business. The ending fight scene without giving anything away is AMAZING and it couldnt have been done better in my opinion. The movie gave me chills just seeing Freddy and Jason finally duking it out and i THANK ronny yu(sp?) for making such a great film especially for horror fans like myself, but also for making a very entertaining movie for first time viewers of the GREATEST slashers of all time.",Freddy vs. Jason

I have seen previews and kept my distance from spoilers, but the movie seemed to have lacked something. Jason did not seem like the old Jason, and of course it's because it was not played by Kane Hodder. Robert Englund, in his last role ever as the infamous Freddy Kruger did an excellent job. The fight scenes were good, but too much CGI brought the film down I felt. The dream sequences were really top notch and I loved the 'Jason Drowning' dream sequence. Ronny Yu did an OK job. I would of rather seen someone else directing it, but he did OK. If you're looking for gore, blood, and a good time, then see Freddy Vs. Jason. It's not a masterpiece and will never win an academy award, but it's a fun flick. The acting is OK also. I would give this movie a 7/10. Go see it if you're a fan of horror.",Freddy vs. Jason

I've the backstories on freddy, jason, and the two leads. Freddy was great. They finally got it right. The perfect mix of the dark, evil, sadistic freddy from part 1 and the funny one from the later movies. As for Jason, the best one in a while. Ken did a great job as Jason and is now at the top of my list of favorite Jasons. Ronny Yu did an awesome job at directing. This movie was awesome. I'm gonna see it again tomorrow.

I loved almost every aspect other than the fact they obviously tried to make the movie appeal to SCREAM generation, but the movie was so good it didn't matter, and besides what movie studio no matter how storied its horror past may be, needs to make its money. Face it, FvJ would have flopped if ONLY hardcore fans (like myself...ii admit it) showed on opening day.

If you are a fan of hard rock/metal (or new age metal, whatever it's called) there's Machine Head, a bunch of other bands from Roadrunner Records including Killswitch Engage, whose ""When Darkness Falls"" plays over the credits. So the soundtrack is definitely awesome for this movie.Second, Kate from Lost (Evangeline Lilly) appears very shortly. Funny seeing her in this movie as an extra before her career took off.If you're a fan of either series, it's definitely worth checking out and to anyone watching this movie as their first Jason or Freddy movie, don't have the highest expectations, take it for what it is.Enjoy!",Freddy vs. Jason

I was VERY excited to finally get to see Freddy on film again.. been waiting a long time! I went to this movie in a matinee show, not expecting much and not wanting to pay much.. I mean, Freddy Vs Jason? Common! I paid $7 for two people. :PI was pleasantly surprised with the movie! Like I said before, I am not a Jason fan but I really enjoyed him in this movie, I thought the fight scenes were excellent and they did a great job with blending the two stories together. The fight scene at the end was great! I came in wanting Freddy to win, but in the end I was torn between the two :) .... I will not tell you how it ends by the way :-PThe only downer of the movie was that the acting between the 'teens' was TERRIBLE! Freddys one-liners were fine (we're used to it) but the terrible lines from the kids was too much... aka ""Freddy's afraid of fire, Jason is afraid of water, how can we use that?"" BLAH! I also thought they did TOO MUCH explaining during some of it... almost like they think the audience is dense and can't understand what's going on... but oh well, the high points make up for the low points.Great effects, especially considering the budget they got for the movie!

I can hardly remember the battle from all the tears in my eyes. Sure I may be immature but if you tried being like me this would be as funny as The Hangover. I even found the start funny!

The acting was horrific and they only character I really liked (the ass flashing mental patient) died way too soon. The blood spurting reminded me of monty python ""it's only a flesh wound"". I would've walked out of the theater but i had already blown 9 dollars.",Freddy vs. Jason
660,emptypromises,When two Horror icons meet. !!WARNING SPOILER!!,4,16 August 2003,"Much like the other movies that preceded Freddy vs. Jason, it left little to be expected.  With a plot full of inconsistencies and a cast with little talent, this movies's purpose was obviously to entertain and not to provoke thought.  It stuck to the formula of other movies in the horror genre. Nudity, death and lots of cheesy lines.  Still the movie served it's purpose.  At least it wasn't a pretentious film like ""Chicago.""  It won't be recognized as a work of cinematic art, but it is entertaining. The opening scene with all the girls hanging out made me want to cry because the acting was so bad and the lines were so cheesy.  Kelly Rowland should reconsider her career as an actress and just stick to singing. If you are a fan of Freddy and Jason you probably will not be disappointed, but otherwise don't waste your time.",Freddy vs. Jason
661,shameless-1,"BETTER THAN EXPCETED, BUT ONLY FOR FANS!",7,15 August 2003,"This film deserves a fair review, but probably won't get one from people who Know nothing! As stated above, this film will only suit true FANS who shall appreciate the result of two cult figures going head to head. What you get from this film is a good story line, an above average teen cast, brilliant effects, outstanding fight scenes between the two bad guys & an appropriate sound track. Because i am a Krueger-Boy, this will sound biased but, for me, Freddy's stock went through the roof. He proved that had he been up against Michael Myers, big mike would have been in some real trouble! I think the way the story tied in the history of both chracters for the new viewers was both integeral and considerate, (if you think about what the writers could have done)also, the direction of the film obviously cannnot match the prowess of Mr Wes Craven, but this is a new era, and Ronny Yu has done no wrong with this latest effort. It has been a Looonnnggg 19 years since a burnt face, dirty sweater wearing, four claw-finger owning Dream Demon named Freddy hit our screens, & some of us have been loving him ever since. (Even though it is written that at one time, he was a Child Molester, strange world huh?)Seeing so many people at the Cinema on friday 15th @Marble Arch,London, proves that whatever anybody says, check it out for your self! Freddy Vs Jason is now my THIRD favourite Nightmare film behind Parts 1 & 3, and is way better than both Jason X & Halloween Ressurection! (and i mean better) It has also been said that there are THREE different endings which you can only see on the DVD, (which i WILL be buying) & there is already a  sequel in the pipe line,(which was confirmed by Englund himself) Overall this film is most enjoyable, with a heap of Machete slashes & well placed jumps. And watch out for the homage to Elm St 1 involving a goat! A Thrilling ride, enjoy. 7 1/2 - 10Thanks for reading.",Freddy vs. Jason

I figured I'd go see it just to watch it turn into some modern day teen piece of garbage.  I was gladly disappointed.  Where all new horror movies need some pointless ""twist"" at the end, this was just a good old slasher flick.  It held true to what made both Jason and Freddy great.  I agree, there wasn't anything really new about it.  Jason sticks to his whole ""slow hulking monster"" thing and Freddy still has his great sense of humor.  But how often do you get to see two of the best killers go at it.  I'd say anyone that is a true fan of either series will be pleased.",Freddy vs. Jason

First of all the director did a good job by not favoring one-side of the movie (eventhough it really is a nightmere on elm street movie).  Second of all, it is a typical popcorn flick that is enjoyable due to its simplicty.  Of course the critics are not going to like it because they are known to not favor horror movies.  This movie is a def must see for all avid fans of the friday the 13th and nightmere on elm street series.

This is a type of movie because of the two killers you could not just have any kind of script to it so,they did a good job putting a great script together. The acting was good, the fight scenes were good, and there even was a bit of humor which gave the movie more than just horror, gore and guts. Remember this is a movie where you have to realize the difficulties it was to make a movie like this actually work and they did a fine job.I don't think anyone could have made the storyline better and play it out the way it did.

669,mraszek,Most entertaining horror movie I've seen,9,18 August 2003,"The long awaited movie where two horror movie legends get to battle each other was a surprising combination of a good script, absorbing character which is not typical for such movies, great special effects and lots and lots of gore.  Although I have seen all Jasons and all Nightmares, I don't consider myself a big fan of either of the series, so I didn't expect much when going to see the movie.  My only motivation was the fact that I really enjoyed Jason X for its dark humor and really bizarre deaths Jason's victims have met with.  I was hoping I would see some of that same humor continued in this installment, and I certainly wasn't disappointed.  The movie explains how the two horror movies are combined in a really interesting way; I was actually into the storyline.  The script is definitely far better than any other horror movie in either of the series, probably because for once the authors really did have to think about it in order to weave the plots of the separate horror legends together.  But another surprise was that the characters in the movie (and by that I mean the future victims of either Jason or Freddy) were much better developed  than typically for such movies. But the best part of the movie, and probably the main reason why people would go to see this movie is that it is extremely realistically gory with each death of the victim outdoing the previous one, and the death count is ridiculously high, so you are never bored.  All of this combined with lots of really neat special effects produced an hour and a half of thorough entertainment.  Totally recommended to any horror movie fan.",Freddy vs. Jason
670,slick80sdude,New Line breathes new life into two dying series,10,15 August 2003,"Since 1992 when New Line bought the rights to Friday the 13th from Paramount they have made two new films in 10 years, the fan despised Jason Goes to Hell, and the comically bad Jason X. It looked bleak for fans of the series, but have no fear, Freddy Vs. Jason is here!For the first time in 13 years (excluding New Nightmare) Freddy Krueger returns to the screen, and its with a considerable BANG! Though the premise seems cheesy, and the character's played out this film never lets up and never lets you down. The writing is far better than the Friday series has ever been and is comparable to the work done by Wes Craven in the original Nightmare. The direction by Ronni Yu (Bride of Chucky) is excellent, which is a huge relief to anyone who saw his entry in the Child's Play saga.Being a fan of both series, and having seen all the preceding films, I have to say this film goes far beyond anything I would have expected from either franchise. I won't tell you any details about the movie, because I would hate to spoil anything, but the story is so perfect it seems almost as if this meeting were destined to happen.Freddy Vs. Jason isn't a masterpiece of modern film making, but it is a blessing for the modern horror genre, and fans of Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street alike.Also you may be pleased to learn that the extremely cheesy line ""place your bets"" has been omitted from the final cut of the film.Bravo New Line. Now lets see an encore!",Freddy vs. Jason
671,KluhEht,The Ultimate Vs. Movie,7,15 August 2003,"(Possible spoilers) Let me break down what I think.  One, the acting is almsot horrible, I've seen worse in horror movies, this is pretty good compared to some, I give the acting 7/10.  Kelly Rowland was better than I expected, and all the characters were down well (especially the druggie).  The screenplay is pretty darned good too.  It's a fanboy's wet dream.  Although some lines we could have done without (paraphrasing:  ""Freddy was killed with fire and Jason was killed with water.  How can we use that?"")  But other than some weird quirks in the screenplay it's pretty good too.  7/10 for screenplay. There was an actual story to it, which you don't see in some horror movies, it was a shallow story, but one nonetheless and it stuck to that.  7/10. Special effects were great.  Freddy's make-up has been better and you could immediately tell some CGI stand-ins (Voorhees Pinball) and you could tell if there was a dummy used (Passed Out and with Freddy) when it fell from something.  But they only flashed by.  It was gory and obviously some of the blood squirting looked very unreal.  But good nonetheless.  8/10.  The only thing that I didn't like was having the Canadian Jason.  Man, why didn't they keep Kane Hodder?  Expressive eyes my ass, you only see his eyes twice in the entire movie.  0/10 on the casting call. Overall score:  7/10 (not an average).",Freddy vs. Jason
672,CrispyXUK,Only for the fans.,3,25 August 2003,"This film is about as good as its gonna get for a film that brings one classic horror icon and one sequel icon together for a big battle.  The good things about it are the fact that it is very similar to the two respective films sequals, which are also the films bad points; this film is neither scary, funny or gorey. I won't even start on story, but your not really going to see for the story are you?3/10",Freddy vs. Jason
673,Rampage7,Very Good Movie Also Suspenseful,10,19 August 2003,"This movie had very good action and fighting in it, the movie has a lot of very good visual effect.

674,jrmpu,"Good, near-mindless fun",5,11 August 2003,"*Disclaimer - just to cover my ass, there may be some minor spoilers below. don't worry though, i'm not going to mention enough to ruin any scenes and i'm certainly not going to mention any details about the ending.I'm surprised no one else has taken the time to write any comments on this yet, as the sneak preview was last thursday.  I saw a review for a movie a couple months back that said something along the lines of ""If you think you'll like it, you will, if you don't, you won't"".  I'd say that's an apt recommendation on Freddy v. Jason.  Out of all the movies in both series, I would rate F v. J second only to the original NOES.  Just so you know where I'm coming from, I've seen all the movies in the two series and usually enjoy them but am not a ""serious"" fan of either.In viewing the movie, it becomes obvious that the filmakers put a lot of effort into paying homage to both series.  The first notes of the score begin with the classic NOES theme then dissolves into the noise we always here when Jason's stalking some helpless teens in a Friday movie.  The first two things I associate with NOES movies are 1) Freddy's smart-ass, one-liner persona and 2) some genuinely creepy moments when Freddy's only operating behind the scenes (i.e. ""one, two, Freddy's comin' for you"", etc.).  F v. J delivers these and it does it well.  I would say better than any NOES since the original.In watching a Friday movie, I expect less genuine scares and more startling jumps and cringes.  Jason's never seemed to exude creepy.  He's more just ""oh sh*t, there's some unstoppable, p***ed off guy... I wonder what kind of hilarious ways he's going to off these teens.""  We definitely get our share of this type of action in F v. J.  It's been a couple years since I've seen some of the Friday movies, so I can't say for sure, but I'm inclined to say F v. J gives Jason more kills than any of the previous movies.  Freddy unleashes him on a teen-rich environment and Jason certainly does take advantage of it.Ok, as it's the title of the film, I should probably comment on the whole Freddy/Jason showdown aspect.  For the most part, I think it works.  I don't think it's too much of a spoiler to say that at different points in the last act of the film, both villians get at least some time with a homefield advantage.  To be true the characters, it simply had to be this way. Freddy is obviously going to have an advantage in the dreamworld and Jason's going to have the upperhand in the real world.  The final showdown plays with this fairly successfully.Other aspects of the film... Frankly, I've gotten to the point where I almost expect bad acting from these franchises.  I was pleasantly surprised by nearly the entire cast.  Not saying anyone's performance is Oscar worthy, but most of the acting is good, especially from the younger actors.  The pacing of the movie is fairly solid.  The internal logic is mostly alright, that is to say, for the most part the movie plays within the rules set up in the previous installments.Ok, I almost feel like this is less a review than it is a preview, but hope it was helpful.  If you're a fan of this type of movie, you ought to like Freddy vs. Jason.",Freddy vs. Jason

Plenty of gory scenes make this just like the Freddy and Jason movies of the past. It also has lots of humor, and some very funny parts. Especially the very last scene of the movie (go see it, you'll know what I'm talking about). The end of the movie is a great fight scene with several ""twists"". There were at least five occasions when LITERALLY the whole audience at the show was cheering, clapping, or chanting either Freddy's or Jason's name. I give it an eight out of ten. It was a little too gory at some spots, and the beginning wasn't quite what I expected. A must see for any fan of the series, or for anyone who likes gory movies!",Freddy vs. Jason

He is the more intelligent of the two monsters, and is never afraid to drop a one liner on his potential victims.Jason, an unstoppable killing machine, relies on his brute strength and his trusty weapon of choice, the infamous machete. While not as quick or witty as Freddy, Jason is no nonsense when it comes to finishing off his foes.Both are apparently unstoppable, but both are looking forward to destroying their counterparts.

The story, acting, and cinematography were all poor.I find it funny that the audience most attracted to this film are mostly under the age of 17 who are not supposed to see it based on it's R rating. Looking at the audience, I would bet that close to half of them would not have been admitted if the theater had any security whatsoever.",Freddy vs. Jason
687,snikt_bamf_thwip,Pleasantly Surprised,10,18 August 2003,"Those are the two best words I can come up with for my reaction to the film that many fans have been waiting years to see. I being the Freddy fan and my friend being the Jason fan, went into this with a really bad feeling that it would be an over-blow, effects laden, badly acted travesty. When in fact it was more of a slightly hyped, mildly effects laden romp with average acting (Robert Englund not withstanding) lol. The only bad thing I felt in the movie was the almost 2 dimensional teenagers.I mean the story was good but I sat there not really caring who lived or died. The cast is mostly unknowns (at least to me) and their acting isn't bad but it isn't great either, but the franchises' for the two villains have never been really built on the teenagers acting now has it? And as far as characters go they were all stereotypical. You have the main heroine, the heroine's G/F, the easy chick, the stoner, the geek, the heroine's b/f and the b/f's best bud, the clueless police deputy, and the rest of the cast is either just there or fodder for Jason! My other complaint is the lack of slashing by Freddy, as most of the victims are done in by a overzealous Jason. However since they needed a reason for Jason and Freddy to duke it out and when Freddy gets in Jason's head, he dishes out a beating I can over look that.For the good points Freddy Vs. Jason pretty much sticks to the mythos of both the NOES and FT13 franchises including an really cool intro by Freddy who sets up the movie. In the movie Jason (Ken Krizinger, not Kane Hodder who I would have rather had playing Jason) is still the hulking, mute, slightly retarded yet angry hockey mask killer we all love to watch. And Freddy (Robert Englund) is still the diabolically evil, child loving er maybe hating, nightmare slasher we all love to laugh at. The special effects or surprising lack thereof really shocked me. Aside from some of the teenage killings most of the deaths in the movie are done with traditional body parts, make up effects, blood tubes and sprayings, etc. I was thinking that every time a person would die it would be digital or would be way to elaborate requiring special effects. I was happy to see that everytime a person was slashed a spray of blood would shoot out the way it used to lol.
Of course there are a few key scenes or deaths where you could tell it was not real but there were many that looked pretty realistic to me. Some other high points of Freddy vs Jason are traditional favorites fans of both films are sure to enjoy. We have the classic 'horny teenagers' which include most of the cast who battle the two villains. We have the inclusion of some nude scenes with hot women, although other than the obvious reason there really was no need for them. We have the classic one liners, obscene gestures, sexual inuendos, tried and true quotes, facial expressions, and of course generally classic acting from Freddy. And not to be outdone Jason still boasts the machete, albeit quite a bit larger than before. He still has the hockey mask, overall things he wears, and the Ki, Ki, Ki, Ma, Ma, Ma sounds that precursor his every move. And both villains find new and funny ways of dispatching their would be dispatchers.However the $4.00 I paid to see the movie (although I've heard of some people paying 9.00 bucks a ticket) was well worth just seeing the gore laden battle between the two titans of terror. With blood flying, body parts being painfully relocated, and throwing everything at each other but the kitchen sink it is the part that people payed to see. What really surprised me was how much Freddy kicked Jason's undead carcass all over Camp Crystal Lake! I was afraid they'd make Freddy Jason's lil be-otch when he is eventually pulled into reality ( as he is in every movie, so why mess with a good thing). Now of course everyone knows that Jason will get up from everything that comes his way, although there were a fews parts where I was shocked he did. In a battle that looks like a WWF match ( actually the director used the WWF for some inspiration in creating the battle) the two slashers finally end up being down for the 10 count...or maybe not! With a twist ending that had the audience cheering this battle could go on for quite some time.So to all you unsure cinema lovers out there who are sitting on the fence when it comes to the film Freddy vs Jason to you I say this. If you have 5 bucks, and hour and forty minutes, (i think, it could have been shorter lol) a strong stomach, a good funny bone, and a love for gore I would recommend this film. Now while it may not be a good as the originals to both franchises, it definetly didn't disappoint me. And it was a helluva lot better than the crapfest called Jason X. I imagine a retarded monkey jumping on a typewriter could have written that better lol.",Freddy vs. Jason

I'm watching part 7 right now the new blood and its really amamzing how much better he is.  Go see this movie.  Fun, Blood, excitment.  My only question is at the end Freddy scares Jason with water, since when has that been a problem for him?  in almost all the friday movies he walks into and hangs out in water all the time.  Ie-Jason Lives when he walks out into the water after Tommy Jarvis calls himn out there.  Anyways it was worth the wait. The movie was amazing.",Freddy vs. Jason
690,Darkshadow214,"well done, almost perfect, but....",7,20 August 2003,"The bottom line: Overall, this movie successfully did the job of blending the 2 horror genres together, and is worthy of the title.Decent story with great fight scenes and deservable deaths.  Well worth the money, time, and the wait.  However, I do have a couple nit-picks, which have prevented this movie from being even better.  I know these are mere nitpicks, but they are just my observations which I believe would've made it a better movie if I was directing: The story itself was impressive, especially incorprating the visual telling of the 2 origins of the monsters.  However, if you're going to show a 'montage' of Freddy's killings in his past movies to build his character, the least they could've done was do the same for Jason, which they didn't. We get a good sense of who Freddy is, then they just throw Jason in with no 'clips' or backstory to show his previous actions to build up his character. Not super-important, but it would've been nice.  This could've been before the main title sequence. Nitpick #2:  Did we really need all the unnecessary backstories?  That girl's father allegedly killing her mother, etc.  Did anyone really care? No!  When this crap is on screen, you're just saying to yourself, 'I dont care about this, I just want to see Freddy and Jason!""  They should've clipped all this bull and put in more J/F scenes! Nitpick#3: Jason himself.  The director did a fantastic job with the rest of the movie, but didn't really seem to know how to direct the Jason character.  Kane Hodder knew 'Jason'; his movements, his walk, his breathing, etc.  This actor didn't really give the Jason character the flavor and prescence of Hodder's Jason, or even the part 6 Jason.  He seemed to be simply 'walking through' some kill scenes and sluggishly swinging his machette at victims with no real hatred (the cornfield scene, for example.) And near the end after Jason gets knocked over by Freddy's torpedos, he stumbles to his feet in a 'not-really-Jason-way).  I would have liked to have seen him lay there motionless for a few seconds, build suspense, then have him instantly sit up, as if it didnt affect him, not struggle upwards like a retarded stuntman.  A lot of the times I felt like I was watching 'Freddy vs stuntman in a hockey mask', not Freddy vs Jason.  And finally, I would've not liked to have seen Jason's eyes so much.  The black holes for eyes are too ominous to miss, and seeing 'real eyes' in the holes make him more 'vulnerable and un-Jasonlike' Again, these are just all my opinions and nitpicks.  But overall, it was a great movie, and highly recommended to all!",Freddy vs. Jason
691,Horrorfreak101,Amazing!,10,20 August 2003,"It began In 1994,Jason Goes To Hell,We horror fans were watching,and out of no where,Freddy Krueger's Razor Sharp Gloves come up out of the depths of hells ground,Grabs Jason's Mask. Literally 10 years after delay,after delay,after delay,Out comes Freddy Vs Jason. I was so pumped when I first saw the trailer,I said to myself,This looks like it was worth the wait. I have been a Freddy fan all my life,I like Jason to don't get me wrong. But You got to love Freddy's dark twisted sense of humor. Ok I waited at the movie theater for more then 6 hours,I couldn't wait to see what I've been waiting to see for the longest time. I got to my seat,and the movie began,and so does my review.The Plot: Teens on Elm Street Haven't been dreaming,Everyone's forgot about Freddy Krueger,Until He rises Jason Voorhees from a deep sleep,to make sure Elm Street fears freddy once again!*SPOILER WARNING*My Review: Well Well,What can I say? Freddy Vs Jason Is just amazing,Ok we start off with some nudity,then we see Good Ole Jason kill her,Heh! But then Out comes Jason's Mum telling him he must make them remember fear on elm street. It turns out Jason's mum is really Badass Freddy Krueger. Jason Rises up,and does what he is told and kills. But Freddy soon becomes displeased with Jason. He makes Jason pay by making him revisit his day at Camp Crystal Lake,where he drowned as a young boy. Our main Character Lori,Tries to save young jason,but freddy pulls Jason under and tries to drown him,until stupid teens wake him up! I swear,can't Freddy just get his kill on? Anyway,They find out how to bring Freddy in the real world(who didn't?)And soon Freddy Vs Jason Is happening,Lets just say Freddy kicks Jason's Zombie ass! Im going to cut the review short. If you want to see a good old Horror movie like its meant to be,watch this,if you hate them,go to hell. See it twice also!! Support this movie! I give FREDDY VS JASON a 10/10!",Freddy vs. Jason
692,wormwar3,Really kewl movie.,10,22 August 2003,"The movie made me laugh my ass off.  The scenes of gore and blood cracked me up.  The scene in the ward with the dude pressing his ass against the screen and farting and making monkey noises was classic.WARNING! SPOILER! IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIE, DON'T READ THE FOLLOWING!  I can't tell who won because after the bloody fight, jason comes walking out of the lake with freddy's head, then freddy winks.  Best movie of this summer.",Freddy vs. Jason
693,wd40cloudweb,Freddy Vs. Jason,9,28 August 2003,Freddy Vs. Jason is by far the best horror sequal since Halloween H20. The film isn't really what the title suggests. The film is mainly about Freddy being too weak to kill the teenagers of Springwood so he ressurects Jason to have him do his dirty work until he's strong enough to do it himself. They really aren't fighting each other until the last quarter of the film. The teenagers have it hard there is a side affect to either one of them surviving. The film has a very good ending to satisfy fans of both Freddy and Jason. An interesting fact about the film is it was originally slated to be made in 1987 by New Line Cinema but they did't own the rights to Friday The 13th then.,Freddy vs. Jason
694,sphinx3214,best freddy and jason movie,10,10 September 2003,this was the best horror flick i've ever seen!! hot teens funny killers this movie should be seen by everone its awesome freddy krueger's humor is the best and jason's well uhh..  jason is just good at killing people (enough said) i hope they make a good sequel,Freddy vs. Jason
695,deliciousprozac,The greats are back for a final showdown.,10,7 October 2003,"Okay, I've read various opinions of this movie and I thought that I should squeeze my 2 cents out. I've been anticipating this movie since I first heard about it years ago. Ever since I was six years old, I've been a Freddy fanatic. This style of horror movie was original and creative. Instead of him killing you in the dark at night like some cliche serial killer, he kills you when you are the must vulnerable...in your dreams. Now I'm not a big fan of Jason but that's beside the point. These are 2 of the horror icons from the '80's.I went to see it opening night and it did not disappoint. Granted, the acting was really lame [especially the part with the father and son on the porch]. The acting felt forced. And there was some nudity [due on the part that this is half of a Jason movie and Jason movies always have nudity or sex in them]. But that's not even supposed to be the main focus of the film. As the title says, it's Freddy vs. Jason. You're supposed to pay attention to the 2 horror gods and then the little stuff can be judged.
Besides my minor reservations on the acting, I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. It didn't live up to all of my expectations but it came pretty close. The fight scenes were incredible and Freddy still had his sarcastic wit about him. Now the comments about the actor who played Jason, here's my input. Anybody can play Jason. Jason walks around, doesn't talk and kills people. If they said the other guy was playing him, you wouldn't even really notice, well, I know I wouldn't of.To summarize, yes there are problem areas with this movie, but there are problem areas with any movie. This movie was a fresh reminder that all the ""horror"" movies that people put out nowadays aren't horror. They aren't remembered years later. But Freddy, Jason, Michael, Pinhead, Chucky, etc. are. I give this movie 8 stars. I didn't want to comment too much directly on the movie so I don't ruin it for people that haven't seen it yet. But I say it's worth giving it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised :)",Freddy vs. Jason
696,jon-lipscombe,"The meeting of two horror icons, shame it wasn't ten years sooner...",10,24 March 2004,"I remember being quite young when I first heard the rumors. It must've been around 1993 or 1994 that I first heard that Freddy and Jason would be squaring off against one another as countless horror fans had hoped for.Ten years later and this is the result, a fast-paced, action packed slasher that intrigues with both it's storyline (ignoring a few plot holes) and it's awesome battle between the two legends.The battle between Freddy and Jason at the end of the film was amazing, I doubt it could've been handled any better. It displayed Freddy and Jason very well, Krueger with his cunning and agility and Jason with his slow but brutal full-on assault.Many people have slated this movie saying it didn't live up to the hype, that true horror fans would be disappointed. Well, it does what it was supposed to do, and that was entertain the masses with an all-out battle between the most terrifying killers of the genre.All in all, this flick delivers and delivers well.",Freddy vs. Jason
697,pickaxe,The first in a hopefully long line of horror icon battles,10,11 April 2004,"Well, well, well.  We have been waiting a long time for this haven't we. I think it was in 1984 when someone asked Robert Englund if he thought Freddy could beat up Jason.  The fact is that it has been over 20 years since the first ideas of this flim have been floating around.  20 years!!!!! How long doews it take, they teased the audience by telling strange stories to film magasines about how Sean S Cunningham and Wes Craven were going to co-direct.  Adding that really confusing part at the end of Jason Goes to Hell with Freddy grabbing Jasons hockey mask.  It really got on my nerves untill i heard that they had actually started filming!Ronny Yu as dirctor? Hmmm, okay then, he's a very talented director but is he good enough for this film, what I really wanted to see was Craven or Cunnignham or even Steve Miner taking the helm, but hey they didn't ask me now did they =).Yu's previous outings that made me turn my head did nto include ""Brida of Chucky"" as many people liked, I hated it, the direction in that film was fairly nondescript.  No, the films that i loved were Yu's early ones, ""The Bride With White Hair"" and it's similary named sequal were amazing, works of cinematic art, so I had faith in him.The acting as far as i could guess would be some random teen idols who couldn't act and didn't need to i'm afraid to say, and hell was I right?NO! The acting in this film is top notch, the main characters are not irritating (with the noteable excetion of Kelly Rowland) and worked very well together.  The main female was obviously chose for two reasons, and im not talking about her charm and sofistication if you know what i mean. The male lead is superb, a real talent who should be big in the future.The film is quite basic to start with, getting started very quickly, in the first ten seconds of film we have a naked femlae and then we have her getting speared to a tree, lovely family film type stuff. The whole film is quite similar to most Friday or Nightmare movies untill the end, oh boy, what an end.  I wont spoil it but if you don't like the idea of Jason and Freddy getting very bloody and violent then this is not your film, if you do then you are normal, buy if you like any kind of horror or action films, if you dont . . . rent it!",Freddy vs. Jason
698,orpheus-24,The Move Rocks,8,31 January 2004,"I've been expecting Freddy Vs Jason on video like hell (because I don't know why but in Greece they didn't play it on the big screen). I think the movie is simply something special for those who loved the Nightmare On Elm Street movies and Friday 13th. I was bouncing up and down like mad on my couch when the fighting sequences between those two came on! Maybe it's pointless filming just more sequels to Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday 13 anymore (I think Englund's done with playing Freddy anymore). Maybe it's time for...match-up movies (Alien Vs Predator coming out this summer,yeah!).",Freddy vs. Jason
699,andrewgh423,My Heart vs. My Fears,8,28 February 2008,"Growing up, I was a huge fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th series. Hearing the news about a merger between the two excited me beyond belief. I obviously went into this movie with high expectations, but I knew that there was a great possibility that this movie would suck. However, I found my expectations to be spot on. The obvious stars, Freddy and Jason, shine like they haven't before. They bring the frights, but also the fun that we have always expected out of them. Their interactions were more than sufficient in pleasing my horror film desires. It is hard to decide who to root for: on one side, you have Jason. He is no different from earlier movies. The serious serial killer who does not stop or allow anything to get in his way. His mysterious actions beautifully draw us closer to him. Freddy is completely different, dropping one-liners left and right that make him irritating yet endearing. Their fight scenes, while not scary, are genuinely entertaining and have the viewer on the edge of the seats. During the final fight scene, I am not sure whether I blinked or not.The supporting cast is full of you damsels in distress and the brave young studs who try to save them. Their tough attitudes are almost laughable, but given some of the serious moments of the film, it is a nice welcome. Perhaps the greatest side character is Kelly Rowland who brings the fierceness to the final fight scene that I still can't seem to get out of my mind. Get it girl, too bad you aren't giving this attitude to Beyonce.In summary, SEE THIS MOVIE. It is great!",Freddy vs. Jason
700,ericwilliams900,Excellent movie!!!,10,2 January 2004,"I thought this movie would be awful,but I was completely wrong! It was incredible!! I recommend this movie to all!! It had everything I thought it wouldn't! I am looking forward to buying this movie January 13th!!",Freddy vs. Jason
701,Young_Buck,best film,10,25 April 2004,well i have to say that the movie was awesome i have all the f13 and the NOES boxed set i have Freddy vs jason on dvd and vhs so i have the best of both worlds. Now the film was good except the end leaves a very big question. Will there be a sequel? and on one of the f13 movies ( i think its jason goes to hell) freddy reaches for jason and pulls him down (to hell) and is that how the idea of freddy vs jason was born? I also think that there should be more F13 and NOES sequels and maybeprequels?I hope the FvJ fans will respond. Bye Bye,Freddy vs. Jason
702,salty_orange,[nauseous shudder],2,25 April 2004,"Well, I'm definitely not against violence in movies, even the gratuitous ""action-style"" that is present in films like ""Kill Bill."" But 'Freddy vs. Jason' lacks every factor that makes a film good. Advertised well with a semi-effective trailer and a good beginning this film got progressively worse as it evolved, butchering the classics from which it was born. VIRTUALLY EVERY PERSON DIES! Terrible storyline and concept, however the acting and character was okay and the movie managed quite a lot of tension. 2/10",Freddy vs. Jason
703,djcommodore,Best film in both NOES and F13 series (SPOILERS),9,13 August 2004,"Freddy vs. Jason is without a doubt my favorite film of all the Friday the 13th's and the Nightmares. Even as a separate movie, it is great. The film explains enough about Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees that even if you have never seen any of the NOES or Friday movies, you can still follow this one and enjoy it without being confused about the story. Jason's kills are great and are unique from the other Friday movies (my favorite is when he stabs the guy in the bed about 20 times, then fold the bed with him in it). Freddy is as good as ever and i like how they show him as both normal Freddy and really-mad Freddy with the different eyes and face. Ken Kirzenger did a great job as Jason even though I am a huge fan of Kane Hodder playing Jason. Jason took on a different look from the last Friday films but not in a bad way at all.The plot was great as it should have been since it took a decade for them to finally come up with one that would tie the two killers together in a ""realistic"" way. It was a fun storyline and kept all the elements of a typical slasher flick. Chicks with big boobs screaming and dying, people who are either having sex or doing drugs (or both) get killed, and lots of blood, guts, and gore.The one annoying part of the movie was the actress' voice who played Lori for the entire second half of the movie sounds as if she is trying way too hard to sound like Macho Man Randy Savage. This is easily overlooked because in the end Jason wins the fight. Though some people may not agree with that, i say that if you're holding the other guy's head in any fight, that makes you the winner.",Freddy vs. Jason
704,andrewlloydwebberfan,Hollywood has done it again!,3,31 December 2004,"Fantastic...another trashy movie!Freddy vs. Jason is about two of the biggest horror characters of 20 years ago, battle each other. This film has many problems with it, but the main problem was the gore. Unfortunately, this film lacks any scariness at all, and the gore makes it just a movie to laugh at! The second main problem: the actors. I have heard many people comment on it being a ""slasher film so the acting isn't really a huge issue"", my response? Well of course Freddy vs. Jason is a slasher film, but if you're going to make a slasher film, why not try and use quality actors? Monica Keena, Kelly Rowland, and the rest of the terrible cast,(with an exception of Englund, who deserves a better directer and script than this), all played their parts with no emotion and depth. Now let's discuss the two main characters....Freddy Krueger- A burned child killer who comes back to life and kills people in their dreams. Actor-Robert Englund-The only actor who I was actually very impressed with, surprisingly enough! He really knew how to bring a great sense of humor, and acting ability into his character. I personally think if Freddy Krueger is an amazingly creative character who deserves to have a good directer...unlike with this film and most of the Elm Street movies.Jason Voorhees- A Phantom of the Opera-rip-off who really didn't have any depth at all. Ken Kirzinger only needed to walk around, and use very simple body language to look sad or angry,(which, even my five year old nephew could do). Worst of all was the ending. Honestly, with the ending you are supposed to assume that there will be a Freddy vs. Jason 2, which I think is an insane idea. All in all this film is just one big gore fest that will make anybody with a good taste in movies, fall asleep. I managed to stay awake with a cup of coffee, but if I wasn't reviewing this movie, I would have definitely fell right to sleep. On a scale of 1-10, I give this a 3, and that is only based on Robert Englund's performance.",Freddy vs. Jason
705,Trailblazer44,You know you love it,7,13 June 2004,"My favorite movie review of all time was for ""Jason Goes to Hell"". It was something like: ""Jason Goes to Hell (1/2 star) From the David Mamet play."" Come on, this is a fan's movie! If you're going to continue to crank out sequels to either or both of these series, then you've got to do it with a little self awareness. First off, let's be straight: these are NOT horror films any longer. If there's going to be any genuine scares in a ""Nightmare"" or ""Friday"" flick, it's purely incidental to the real aim. These are COMEDIES. And that's just what FvJ is. Just as with ""Bride of Chucky,"" Ronny Yu's given us a nice, juicy slab of chuckles served in a rich bloodfest sauce. I say bon apetite. The effects are way above par for low-budget schlock and Yu gets more realistic performances from his teen cast than the material deserves. Anyone who decries this film isn't being honest with themselves. You knew what you were getting into when you bought your tickets, get over yourself.",Freddy vs. Jason
706,Blackriffy,It's a good comedy too.,10,30 October 2004,"Since I'm a fan of Jason, I had to see this movie. It wasn't what I kinda expected, but it was just as good. It had a lots of funny scenes and quotes, and the acting wasn't so bad. In my opinion, it should be listed as a comedy too, because If I didn't know this was a real F13/NOES movie, I'd say it's a parody.A little spoilers coming, you've been warned! Ken Kirzinger was the right man to be chosen as Jason. He's big, plus he had a cool walking style (Or then it's just me). And the original Robert Englund still got it. Thing which made me a little frustrated was that the movie didn't have a real winner, though we can see Jason with Freddy's head in the end. I really recommend this movie. It may not be the best horror movie, but it's still funny, and it has our favorite undead killers!",Freddy vs. Jason
707,knowicki14,Used to be a guilty pleasure,3,6 March 2021,"Used to be a big guilty pleasure of mine. It was never a traditionally good movie but one I found entertaining to watch. Well after watching it again for the first time in a few years, I've come to the realization that this movie is just straight up bad. It's called Freddy vs. Jason but they don't actually fight until the last 30 minutes of the movie. The first hour or so of the movie is just a bunch of stupid teenagers making really dumb decisions and getting killed. None of the kills are even that memorable, especially compared to some of the more interesting kills in the Nightmare franchise. The films biggest flaw in my opinion is that for most of the runtime, the film is just boring.",Freddy vs. Jason
708,twmmorgan-1,A Screaming Delight,10,22 August 2004,"And thats exactly what it is! A delight! In a up to date film, New Line Cinema bring back two of the most feared horror icons that have ever appeared out of a film. Freddy Krueger is stuck in hell and the only way he can come back to Elm Street is by creating fear upon the houses of the town. Tricking Jason Voorhees into appearing in Springwood, Freddy uses Jason as his puppet. As soon as there is enough fear, Freddy appears...but there's one problem... Jason wont stop. The only way is for Freddy to take jason out himself...but its not that easy. With a group of teenagers, Springwood and Camp Crystal lake in the middle, The two terrors hack at one another, a battle for blood of Evil Vs Evil! Who wins? Watch it!",Freddy vs. Jason

Even though I never watched one of the ""Friday the 13th"" series, the Jason character with the hockey mask was, of course, also known to me. What I also liked was that ""Freddy vs. Jason"" stays pretty true to the spirit and storyline of the original background of both series.For me, this movie has everything one could look for in such a film. Freddy delivers his usual fun lines. Jason looks cool and scary while he is literally mowing a field of teenagers with his machete. Well done special effects. I give the director credit for removing some of the effects that where not so well done, as shown in the DVD extra material. This is a special effect horror movie festival.

THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME! I mean...2 killing legends that cannot be killed all in 1 movie...and when they get mad at each other, well...that's when it get's really good! HAHA, the perfect movie for night time! The only reason I didn't give it a 10 outta 10 is because there could have been more fighting and the effects weren't exactly like Dawn of the Dead, which Dawn of the Dead's were awesome! But in Freddy vs. Jason, when they get seriously injured, you can actually tell that the blood is being pumped, rather than it's realistically coming out of the cut/slice/whatever. What I'm saying is...you can tell it's staged, and although you already know it is, they could have at least made it a little more real. Other than that, I definitely recommend it to Freddy fans, Jason fans, Horror fans, gore fans or Action fans!",Freddy vs. Jason
712,korn-jon_davis_90k,Great Film,10,29 August 2006,"I loved Freddy vs Jason. But then again I love any film with Freddy in, coz I'm a major Freddy fan. There's lots of good kills n jokes in here. It was the film that got me over how scary I thought Freddy used to be :P:P I will say it IS more like an action film than horror seeing as it's not even scary, hehe. I would like to know where Freddy learned all his new moves... Good story but I think Kelly Rowland should stick to singing...not exactly the best actor. Other than that the acting is TOO bad. Robert Enlgund is a good as he always is (which is very good) Jason isn't too hard to play but I think Ken Kirzinger did a good job. As for the story line it was good...but I really don't know how Freddy came back as the dream demons left his head at the end of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare...maybe they went back or something but there was no mention of it. The graphics were great, I especially like the bit when Lori's dad's head turns into Freddy's when he says 'Look at you...you're exhausted...we need to get you to BED'. I thought that was really cool. Also when Mark wakes up and his face is slashed by the window. Personally Freddy will always win in my eyes :P Jason cool but he REALLY ISN'T THAT cool to beat Freddy. All in all a great film...so far I've seen it about 10 times n I still haven't got bored. Maybe that's just me but oh well. 10/10.",Freddy vs. Jason

I was so happy the day it came out on DVD I watched it almost every day since I got it. It was surprisingly good too. I mean there are some problems but the movie is just too good to be mad at I give it a 10/10 and my highest recommendation. (It should have won an Oscar! Just kidding:)I mean the characters are also pretty likable as well, and really in my opinion Kelly Rowland wasn't that bad of a character, because I've heard people say that they were happy when she was killed but really I thought she did good for her 1st film. The battle was great to and Freddy can fight much better then Jason, I mean Jason hardly even throws a punch! Freddy should take the win all the way! This is my 1st comment and I didn't really want it to be that long but, the site require me to write 1,000 words, I think they should fix that!

Ha, what drugs can do to you... lmao. Other ways it sucks, like, how the big breasted, blonde beauty finally KNOWS she'll get a lick in hitting one of the evils and declares ""Die bitch!"" or some finishing words... the awkward thing about that though is she is role-played as a very shy and quiet girl. Not until all major havoc was done does she get angry, but before, when havoc was starting, she's terrified... to me, that sucked, what a coward... If it wasn't for that, it'd be a 8... maybe better. It is a good thriller if it wasn't for all the whinny preppy chicks who think their fat, scream loud, and have a last minute of preaching before death. It's still cool, its worth your time...

Also I knew it wouldn't happen but I was hoping that Wes Craven would have had something to do with this one! But disappointment's aside this was good movie,not really scary,but it had a good story, a couple nice tit shot's, a nice amount of blood,a decent body count, and a kick ass battle seen with Freddy and Jason! so to any fan of the Freddy or Jason movies I would recommend seeing this Movie!

716,LewisHughes01,The ultimate clash of Horror Legends,8,3 March 2018,"With the later entries into the 'Friday the 13th' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' franchises proving hit and miss, it would have been easy for ""Freddy vs Jason"" to have flopped massively not just at the box office but also critically and narratively, however, this movie does quite the opposite and instead provides a satisfying end to Robert Englund's reign as Freddy Krueger and pays respectful homages to the franchises from which it is birthed.The primary focal point of attention for the majority of mainstream reviewers regarding horror movies, especially 'slasher' movies, is that they lack a real narrative or reason and rely on kill after kill to string the story together and, while this is true for many of its predescors in the Elm Street and Friday the 13th franchises, the plot of this movie feels clear and cohesive with a distinct narrative that perfectly brings together the worlds of both Freddy and Jason by utilising iconographic locations and imagery we had seen previously. The contrast between Freddy's deviousity and Jason's brute strength is something horror fans have wanted to see since Freddy's debut on screen in 1984's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and the interest in the two horror icons meeting peaking during the cliffhanger ending of ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" in which Jason's iconic mask is pulled into hell by Freddy's equally epochal glove; this film does not fail to meet these colossal expectations and delivers everything any horror fan would ever want to see in a clash of these titans.Characterisation in terms of the titular antagonists remains consistent to their over two-decade-long history in cinema: Jason is an unstoppable force of evil unparalleled in the fright he causes by remaining so silent and moving so montorously - this film continues the tradition of having Jason kill teens in outrageous and gruesome ways, of course - while Freddy is a one-liner-spewing immense terror-creating monster who will remain a pop culture icon even after these movies are long forgotten. Positively, the characterisation of the convention and rudimental teens in ""Freddy vs Jason"" is actually one of the best in the genre with primary protagonist Lori (Monica Keena) and her friend Kia (Kelly Rowland) being particularly memorable.Ultimately, ""Freddy vs Jason"" is an amazing watch for any long-term fan of either franchise or Horror fans as a whole and can be enjoyed just as any other slasher while also supplying a freshness to the industry by introducing the idea of horror legend crossover movies which will, hopefully, lead to further movies in the same vein being produced. With great characters and a fufilling answer to the time old question of ""Who would win in a fight, Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees?"" this film is definitely worth an 8/10 rating and your watch.",Freddy vs. Jason

Maybe I'll go buy Mr.Yu a copy of F.T.13th part 7. 3rd If Freddy wanted Jason to kill so ppl would remember him then why didn't he just do what he did in the first movie? GO INTO PPL's NIGHTMARES? GEEZ Jason is an adult and there are adults in the movie who remember him so why didn't he kill THEM? I could go on all day with the mistakes but i'll jump ahead to promos. unbiasly I get the distinct feeling that this was more of a FREDDY movie instead of a VS. movie. Everything about it points to Freddy this and Freddy that. Don't get me wrong i love both but a VS. movie is just that. Predator vs. Alien BEAUTIFUL 1.",Freddy vs. Jason
719,sirchebs,A little subdued and anti climatic,5,12 February 2018,"Well myself like all horror fans from the 70's and 80's were really looking forward to seeing this project however it failed on a few levels and here is why. Firstly Jeff Katz's decision to dump Kane Hodder in favour of Kirzinger was a huge no no, simply because Kane made the part his own much like Englund had with Freddy. The second mistake was the casting of the ""teenagers"" Monica keena below awful, Kelly Rowland seriously?? The plot was hashed together, rushed in places and hurried at the end. I mean the kids figuring out who Freddy was and then guessing how both killers died to pit them against each other. This movie could of and should of been so much more.Too many joke moments as well turned Freddy into a clown, together with the fact that Jason kills Freddy then works with the teenagers at the end before slipping peacefully into the lake.Jeff Katz formally of New Line you suck big time,",Freddy vs. Jason
720,abmar,The one who actually better at fighting,8,19 November 2005,"Here are the fighting capabilities of the two.-Freddy is smarter than Jason. (takes advantage of Jasons fear and uses objects around him as weapons) -Freddy has faster attack speed and accuracy landing way more hits on Jason. -Jason has slower attack speed but high damage and low accuracy. -Freddy has low defense but high dodge rate. One hit by Jason hurts him really bad but he doesn't get hit much. -Jason has extremely high defense and can sustain a lot of damage.-When fighting in the dreamworld Freddy is obviously better harnessing supernatural powers. -Jason needs the help of the kids in fights.I'd say Freddy is a much better fighter, however Jason is a far more effective killer as Freddy postpones killing the victims for too long.",Freddy vs. Jason
721,johnnyj2005,"That was alright, make the sequel better please!",6,24 January 2006,"Look, don't get me wrong, Freddy vs. Jason was decent in the cinemas, nice effects, included the backstories nicely and sum choice one-liners, but after the first time it all got a bit stale; a touch predictable. It was one of those movies that just seemed to lose it's scare-factor far too much after the first viewing, because you just knew when the deaths came, the loud noises cracked, and when Freddy spat out yet another dry, sharp-witted one liner. The story itself was also pretty basic, and if u read the review (or the back of the DVD) before you saw this, you would have the entire movie in front of your eyes. There weren't any subplots, not much set up for the sequel (though what was done was oh-so easy to connect to a sequel) and there probably needed a little more depth or length to the battle of the horror movie tyrants.But after watching Freddy vs. Jason for the first time, you will wonder how a sequel will be done. surely if it was just a rematch between the two manic killers, there would need to be a large explanation of how they got themselves together for such an event, but if another horror icon was involved, it could shaken things up just a little... but there would be an explanation for the new icons existence in the poor victims lives no doubt, and a lengthy backstory to make it understandable. it can be done, but just more depth in the story would be MUCH appreciated.",Freddy vs. Jason
