0,TheLittleSongbird,Horrible,2,1 January 2011,"Before I get flamed for this review, I really tried to like The Passion of the Christ. But I just couldn't. Granted, the cinematography and visuals are excellent and the score is great. But it is so brutal and sadistic in its violence I actually had to watch the film in chunks because of being sick in the toilet for what seemed like every twenty minutes. I accept it was like that, but seriously some of it is sickening. The story is never compelling either, it is very slow paced and is vastly overshadowed by the images every time it tries to get somewhere, while Gibson's direction is somewhat self-indulgent. The pace is meandering and slow, the dialogue aims to move and shock but does neither because it was so hackneyed and emotionally The Passion of the Christ is manipulative and perhaps hypocritical too. Never once was I sympathetic or moved, any time I cried it was with disgust. The acting didn't fare much better either, Jesus was well portrayed but everyone else I couldn't give a tuppence about. Overall, maybe I need to see this film again, but I hated it and didn't see the point to it. 2/10 Bethany Cox",The Passion of the Christ
1,SnoopyStyle,expertly made,8,26 March 2016,"Director Mel Gibson brings the last day of Jesus (Jim Caviezel) to the screen. It is after the last supper and Judas betrays Jesus to the authorities for 30 pieces of silver. Jesus is arrested, beaten, convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to death. Roman Governor Pontius Pilate sends him to King Herod. Herod sees Jesus as a fool and releases him back to Pilate. Fearing a revolt, Pilate offers a choice to the crowd between Jesus and Barabbas.This is a relatively literal interpretation of the passion play. Mel even uses Aramaic. It is expertly made and delivers the material. There is a vein of anti-semitic bend while Pilate is excused with more humanity. I don't think the film can force modern values on the 2000 year old text. For true believers, this is heaven. Every whip mark is felt. For non-believers, this is a good representation of the text.",The Passion of the Christ
2,Hitchcoc,Missing What It Could Have Been,3,15 February 2006,"I go back and forth on my beliefs. I went to this movie so I could attend a discussion group. I have seen numerous portrayals of the final days of Christ. Even to one who is not a strong believer, the faith comes through; but it comes through in the words and the sacrifice. There is pain and there is pain. It is bad enough that a method of execution such as crucifixion existed in our world. There are other forms of torture and brutality still existing today. But in all the Freddy Krueger, Jason, Halloween movies, I'm not sure that I've ever seen one person hit so many times with so many devices. Where is the impetus for this. When a director fails to take into account the totality of his characters and their ""humanity"" because we all have some of this, it becomes one dimensional. Jesus reminded me of those aforementioned horror figures who kept bouncing back no matter what they did to him. If the soldiers acted under orders, they still were family men and world citizens. I have a feeling there was about the same amount of hatred in the world back then as there is now, and for some, the power of destroying another is there. But to label all sociopaths just doesn't work. I liked the non torture part of the movie; even the portrayal of the actual crucifixion, but Jesus wouldn't have lasted five minutes. Ask any doctor who watched. And to say he's supernatural. Well, yes. But he is human at this point. That's why it's such a sacrifice to die for his belief in being the savior. This is really a slasher movie.",The Passion of the Christ
3,Horst_In_Translation,You will need an interest in religion for this movie,4,21 May 2015,"This is an 11-year-old movie written and directed by Mel Gibson. For him it was his very first effort as a screenwriter (he had help from a co-writer with many years of experience though) and it was, 9 years after Academy Award Best Picture winner ""Braveheart"", his eagerly expected next directorial effort. And what he came up with was probably the most controversial movie of the 21st century. It's roughly two hours of watching Jesus Christ being tortured in all kinds of manners: lashes, crown of thorns (toughest part for me to watch) and finally how he is nailed to the cross where he died in the end and which lasted easily longer than a third of the entire movie. And this is only the physical pain. There is lots of emotional torture as well when he is accused all the time of being a false prophet.For me personally, this was mostly two hours of torture porn. I have no real interest in religion and that is why I probably did not catch most of the symbolisms, but with so many atheists out there, that is certainly a problem many more people had. I felt the movie began rather boring and uninteresting, but quickly improved. Yet, I never had a moment where I would say that this is a must-watch by any means. By the way, the version I watched had almost no English language in it, all Latin I believe, so you will definitely need subtitles. The cast is relatively unknown. Also the lead actor is not a really big name. The only one I was familiar with is Monica Bellucci. You may have seen her on ""The Matrix"". ""The Passion of the Christ"" scored three Academy Award nominations (music, makeup, cinematography), but didn't win any. The final thing I want to say is that it was occasionally too showy and in your face for my taste. It is based on historical events, but we do not really know if his executioners were really as sadist as they are depicted here, if they truly enjoyed beating the crap out of him with their lashes etc. This is all for shock purpose here, but there is no way to examine if all this was really true. And I usually do not like when films take this path. That's a major criticism and there are more. All in all, not recommended. Especially not if you are easily offended by violence as there is such from start to finish, almost uninterrupted.",The Passion of the Christ
4,claudio_carvalho,"Free Violence, In an Unnecessary Sadistic Version of the Last Moments of Jesus Christ Recommended for Butchers and Vampires",5,9 October 2004,"There are many excellent movies about the life and death of Jesus Christ. Any reader of IMDb site can make a search to check it. I am not religious, but I liked 'Jesus' (1999), 'King of Kings' (1961) and some other versions, which I do not recall the original title. I really believed that this theme had been depleted in the cinema industry. Mel Gibson, however, decided to innovate and make a polemic sadistic version of this biblical story. In his movie, there are only torture, blood, beating, blood, free violence, blood... and more blood. The performance of the cast is magnificent, the aesthetic and photography is wonderful, the locations are stunning. But this Mel Gibson's version is highly recommended for butchers and vampires. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): 'A Paixão de Cristo' ('The Passion of Christ')",The Passion of the Christ
5,jboothmillard,The Passion of the Christ,6,9 April 2007,"If you thought A Clockwork Orange, The Evil Dead, The Exorcist, Monty Python's Life of Brian were controversial films, then you should see this ""labour of love"" from director Mel Gibson (Braveheart). Basically, in Latin and Aramaic language, it tells the story of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ (James Caviezel) on Earth, from the betrayal of Judas (Luca Lionello) in the Garden of Gethsemane after the Last Supper, until his crucifixion. The people who have captured him have their reasons to believe his biggest crime is ""blasphemy"", saying he is the son of God and stuff, but the authorities can't see any reason to sentence him. They instead give him severe punishment, with Jesus being scourged (whipped) by sticks, and by sharp-ended strings on his back, and his front, which is horrifying to watch for the amount of blood and scars, and it is the son of God. Then they eventually decide that Jesus should be sentenced to death by crucifixion, and he starts carrying the heavy cross to the mountain. He has many falls on the way and gets help from a stranger before they finally reach Mount Cyanide and Jesus has his hands and feet nailed to the cross before it is raised. The Messiah begs God to help him and cries that he has forsaken him, and he eventually dies from the loss of blood, and his body is taken down by the ones who loved him. There is a small moment of hope in the ending with Jesus resurrecting on the day of Easter, and you see the hole in his hands made by the punctures. Also starring Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Christo Jivkov as John, Francesco De Vito as Peter and Giacinto Ferro as Joseph of Arimathea. If you decide to watch this one day, be warned that it is quite hard to deal with, and you can see why churches and others wanted it banned. The fact that the film was re-released with 15 minutes of violence cut out to make it a 15 didn't help enough, and without it, it certainly wouldn't be considered quite a powerful piece. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Makeup, and Best Music, Original Score for John Debney. Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Jesus's carrying of the cross mixed with Mary's flashbacks of him as a child.

6,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'The Passion Of The Christ',7,22 April 2007,"I can't believe I didn't write a review after seeing this, but I must have incorrectly presumed I did. With so many other reviewers by now, I'll make my points as brief as possible. GOOD - Kudos for someone finally presenting an accurate account of Christ's sufferings, as gruesome and horrible as they were, although, if you read the Gospel accounts in the Bible, it was even worse than shown on this film. Jesus' face was beaten to a pulp and ""unrecognizable"" so keep that in mind if you think the film overdid the beatings. However, the overall effect is that there isn't anything sanitized in this film; it's an according-to-the-Book account and after you see this on film, it shakes you up.I heard that people were so stunned they couldn't speak for about a half hour after coming out of the theaters. I thought that was probably exaggerated, but it wasn't. I felt the same way, just stunned at what I had witnessed. As a Believer, it was something I needed to see to remind me of what this God-in the flesh human voluntarily went through. For non-Believers, scoffers or whatever, I don't know what your reaction was to the film but for me, it was a humbling, sobering experience.THE BAD - The unrelenting brutality against Jesus the last three-quarters of this film is so bad that, frankly, I would hesitate before ever watching this again. One viewing is enough. I am amazed so many people sat through this, including Christians. I wish director/producer Mel Gibson had shown more of Christ's resurrection instead of centering 99 percent of this movie on his suffering, although I understand Mel's point. However, all of Jesus' claims and sufferings are meaningless without the resurrection, so why not emphasize that instead of just tacking it on for the last minute or two? Just asking.It's a cliché, but this is a film you won't soon forget, but I would add to that, one you probably won't want to watch multiple times.",The Passion of the Christ
7,ma-cortes,"Extraordinary, wonderful and bloody Christ Passion",9,20 April 2004,"The film centers about the Passion of Christ for twelve Hours That Changed the World . The movie, behind the greatest event in the history of the world. Dealing with one man changed the world forever. It is very strong ,the punishment is breathtaking . It begins in the garden of Getsemani where he's betrayed by Judas Iscariot in exchange of thirty coins.He's led to governor Poncio Pilatos, but he washes his hands. Jesus Christ is condemned to die . Then the passion goes on : knocks, punches ,lashes, the blood drills along his skin. The experience of Christ suffering is overblown. He must carry the cross over his shoulders, but he's helped by Simon. He's crucified in the Golgota hill and there suffers new tortures. By his wounds, we were healed and Jesus gave his life for us .The picture is very well played by James Cazievel as Jesus , Mia Morgenstein as Virgin Mary , Lionello as Judas and and Monica Belucci as Mary Magdalene . It packs a colorful and evocative cinematography by Caleb Deschanel . As well as a sensitive and exciting musical score by John Debney . The movie was stunningly directed by Mel Gibson who formerly made another great epic : Braveheart .Rating : 8.5/10 , above average . Well worth watching . Essential and indispensable seeing .",The Passion of the Christ
8,BA_Harrison,The 'Hostel' of biblical movies: bloody but boring.,4,16 January 2016,"I'd heard that The Passion of the Christ topped Eli Roth's Hostel films in terms of brutality and gore, and it is certainly no stroll in the park, dwelling as it does on the suffering and pain of Jesus' final hours on Earth as interpreted by director Mel Gibson. But like so much 'torture porn', Gibson's overload of sadistic graphic violence soon becomes wearisome, and with a story that is so familiar to all, even to non-Christians (I think I'm not spoiling the film for anyone by saying that Jesus dies on the cross at the end), Passion offers very little to grip the viewer. I imagine that even devout Christians, for whom the film is meant to be a profound and moving experience, will get fed up with the endless floggings and the repeated sight of a broken and bleeding Son of God falling to the ground in slow motion.Technically the film is as good as one might expect from an Oscar winning film-maker: the direction is stylish, the cinematography impressive, the acting solid, and the music superb, while the fact that the whole film is spoken entirely in Aramaic, Latic and Hebrew is surely something of a modern miracle—quite how Mel conducted proceedings in three languages, one of which is dead, is difficult to fathom. Unfortunately, these merits only count for so much, and Passion ultimately disappoints.",The Passion of the Christ
9,dbdumonteil,the last hours of Christ given a new treatment by Mel Gibson,1,15 April 2007,"So, here's the most contentious film of 2004, relating the last hours of Christ which received kudos from mainstream public. But it also caused a lot of ink to flow even before the film reached the streets because of its gore vision of the historical facts. In France, the film didn't arouse as much controversy as in other countries, notably the United States and I think it's due to the fact that religion is much less prevailing in French society.I prefer to be frank straight away: Mel Gibson's film is a total failure at all levels. I don't challenge at all Gibson's convictions whose project was close to his heart. He has his reasons to defend his work. And however, at first glance, his intentions appear commendable. First, to be as accurate as possible from a historical perspective. Many historians affirmed that the film was historically rigorous but it seems to me that Gibson took some liberties with episodes and characters: were Jewish priests directly responsible for Jesus' death? Were Roman soldiers that much cruel and sadistic? Was Judas in prey to unnerving visions before he killed himself? I have my doubts.The use of ancient languages to confer to the film authenticity was also at first judicious but there's a big mistake, Greek was the language spoken.To relate Christ's martyrdom from his arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane to his crucifixion on Golgotha mount, Gibson goes at it hammer and tongs. For realism's sake, he falls back on a clean cinematography, extreme sound, visual effects to make us realize how much Christ suffered and there's the rub. By following a climbing in visual violence and an overwhelming music, Gibson falls right into the trap and loses the plot. We are entitled to an endless scourging sequence that lasts about ten minutes. It's unlikely that a normal man could survive to such an inhuman corporal sentence. Then, during his way to his cross, Christ is victim of the brutality of the mob and soldiers, he falls three times and on Golgotha, he has the appearance of a meat chunk whose crucifixion is filmed in minute detail with unhealthy fascination. The whole is often interspersed with sequences in slow-motion and sketchy flash-backs. Without mentioning a nearly laughable last shot which showcases resurrected Christ. All these bombastic, visual means deprive the film of its spiritual and humane dimension and become tiresome in the long run. Emotion and sympathy are downright absent, even when the camera lands on Mary and Mary Magdalene's faces. Were these repulsive images necessary? Gibson always had a bias for masochist complacency and one can really wonder about the reasons of the commercial triumph of the film. I've read that Gibson's contentious work converted a good proportion of viewers. It's creepy...What appeared on the paper as heartfelt intentions ended up giving way to a repulsive result on the contents and form. Don't waste your time with it.",The Passion of the Christ
10,Quinoa1984,"For the audience, this is one of the most subjective films made in recent history...",5,12 September 2004,"...and I suppose on that level Mel Gibson's ""hottest"" movie since Braveheart and the Lethal Weapon days, is a success. Rarely has an audience been so polarized, so backed into a corner by the media's controversy, and by the reactions from audiences around the world (or rather in America, in other countries the film didn't have as huge an impact, at least box-office wise). Some of the best movies bring forth people to discuss them, to debate them, to conjure thought. While The Passion of the Christ does that, its controversies don't end up as one of the best movies of the year for me, far from it. It's like if Pier Paolo Pasolini (director of Salo, a film that beats this film to the rank of the most disturbing over-the-top ""statement"" movie ever) had been given Hollywood money, sat through a few dozen Italian horror films for inspiration beforehand, and decided to re-make his The Gospel According to St. Matthew (without the 'talky' points). Or, maybe not. Maybe it's just Gibson spewing out everything in his twisted head about what he thinks on Jesus. But one thing it's not is authentic, at least emotionally.Those reading this review and others on this site know what the film's about- like The Passion of Joan of Arc (one of my favorites and infinitely more compelling and tragic on a tortured soul, despite no money and no sound and minimal violence), Gibson takes the last hours of an infamous figure's life, and condenses it into a film. Whatever glimpses we get of Jesus' teachings and life before his betrayal and torture and death are snipped in as though Gibson wanted Tarantino's story structure from Reservoir Dogs. And like Tarantino, though on another playing field with even more melodrama, at least 2/3 of the film is devoted to showing Jesus as something of a superhero, able to withstand tumultuous whippings, scourges, crown-o-thorns, and his arduous trip through town to the hilltop without once going unconscious or (gasp) killed before the big show. Other images pop up here and there, such as the always weeping Mary Magdalene and Mother Mary, the weird Devil children and lady Satan, and the attitudes (though, unlike Joan of Arc, no close-ups) of the angry Jewish priests.As I said, to watch this film for objectivity is not so much as for subjectivity. In the film-making department, Gibson does implement some good things- with Francesco Frigeri and Carlo Gervasis' set and production design, as well as Caleb Deschanel's cinematography; the film at times is sweeping in its scope and detail. But on the other hand (as with the treatment of the Jesus character) the tone of the film is mostly one note, and loaded with a banging melodrama that keeps the tone of the picture on a track that will get boring for those who aren't with the mood of the film every step of the way. John Debney's music is also as melodramatic as it is chinsy. Then there is Jesus himself, the way he is presented, taken out, and so on, and this where the subjectivity comes in. The problem is, as much as it sounds like it might be fascinating to try, I can't change my beliefs around a film, and no one film will change my mind on how I view a particular religious character(s). Not even The Last Temptation of Christ, a film that made Jesus at least more than a one-sided caricature, could persuade me to go on that route. I'm not saying the film forces a person to accept Jesus as savior and the one and only messiah (though it's not totally un-true that it will mark higher importance if you're 'deep' into Christianity), but it doesn't give a person much room to question the logic behind the approach to it all. Aside from all the excessive violence and brutality, which I could take and I know others could not, it is thematically a difficult film, and it doesn't leave room for compromise. On one hand the idea behind the story is daring, and on the other hand the execution of it is, in a sense, preaching to the choir. It doesn't help much to the fact that Jim Caviezel, while authentic in the look, is almost catatonic in much of his performance when he's not spouting off at the trial or moaning in his tortured state.At best, Gibson's vision of the final day and night of one of the most infamous figures in recent (if you look at the history of the world, two thousand years isn't too long of a time) history, is unique. I doubt anyone else in Hollywood would have the conviction to go through with it. But at worst, it's only of worth to those who are already down with the Lord Jesus Christ, and is the closest thing this year to being a snuff film. If you saw it in the theater or decide to rent it now on rental you'll know what that means. Like a carefully planned and structured train wreck, this is one artist's interpretation that didn't enlighten or inspire or make me think about what it was like to be Jesus ('Temptation' did that), but it will for some, and is not entirely forgettable. 5/10",The Passion of the Christ
11,wes-connors,"No Pain, No Gain",2,12 October 2009,"""From 'Academy Award'-winning director Mel Gibson comes a profound story of courage and sacrifice depicting the final twelve hours in the life of Jesus Christ. Featuring stunning cinematography and an inspired performance by Jim Caviezel, 'The Passion of the Christ' is a triumphant and uncompromising film-making achievement,"" according to the DVD sleeve. If your eyes are good, you will spot the teeny tiny asterisk noting that Mr. Gibson did not win an ""Academy Award"" for any of his work on THIS film. But, the ""stunning"" cinematography, by Caleb Deschanel, was nominated.As described, the film opens with Luca Lionello's Judas betraying Mr. Caviezel's Jesus, leading to the latter's crucifixion. There are a few short flashbacks to happier times, but ""The PASSION of the Christ"" proceeds to be a relentlessly brutal and bloody depiction of the Christian savior's last hours on Earth. Jesus is so severely tortured you will wonder how he lived to deliver any famous last words. Highlights are a face-down ""body slam"" of Jesus' nailed body to the ground, and a final piercing thrust - to make sure that he's not only MERELY dead, but REALLY MOST SINCERELY DEAD. Writer/producer/director Gibson begins with a moody moon shot, which is nice; and, there are some dazzling aspects to the production. Judas' demise is nicely done. Still, there is no ""story"" being told; instead, you are expected to bring prior knowledge to the film. Gibson emphases the violent parts of the classic ""Passion Play"". He includes unflattering Jewish figures; arguably, they are balanced by Rabbi Jesus and his friends. Homosexuals aren't so lucky; for example, consider how Gibson envisions Satan as the androgynous, effeminate figure who sends Jesus his snake.

12,Coventry,"Jesus Christ, super-sufferer!",3,14 April 2004,"All my life, people are looking weird at me for liking vicious and violent exploitation cinema that shows explicit torturing and pain! Now, all of a sudden, this is brilliant filmmaking just because the famous Mel Gibson made a controversial and offensive film??? The Passion of the Christ is nothing but a bombastic exploitation flick, people! It's much closer to the eurohorror shock cinema than any other film I ever seen and the only different aspects are the huge budget and the presence of some famous names. Well actuallythere's another difference! At least cheap 70's exploitation-films have a story to tell. I fully understand that it was Gibson's idea to put the stress on the suffering and Jesus  role as a martyr but  what's the point? Okay, if Jesus ever existed he sure did sufferpoint taken! But showing a man getting lashed for half an hour, and then a detailed `Via Dolorosa' for yet ANOTHER hour may be a little exaggerated, no? It sure is bloody and shocking, I'll be the first to admit thatBloody and boring, the most painful' combination a film can have. In my opinion, this is a very bad film. It completely lacks depth, range and tact. The few, short flashbacks seem to be dragged into it, in order to put some extra stress on the sentiment. I'd compare `The Passion of the Christ' with films like `Irréversible', `Funny Games' and `Benny's Video' Not because of their message', but simply because all these film show an unhealthy obsession to make the viewer focus on pure agony.

14,sunwarrior13,Extreme Violence And The Resurrection,10,9 September 2012,"The Passion of the Christ is a film directed by Mel Gibson and it features Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ together with Maia Morgenstern, Monica Bellucci and Hristo Shopov. It depicts the Passion of Jesus largely according to the New Testament Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. It also draws on other devotional writings, such as those disputably attributed to Anne Catherine Emmerich.The film covers the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, beginning with the Agony in the Garden and ending with a brief depiction of his resurrection. In the Garden of Gethsemane near the Mount of Olives, Jesus is betrayed by Judas Iscariot. Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy and brought before Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, for sentencing. The roaring crowd demand his death, so Pilate orders his crucifixion. Jesus is severely beaten and made to carry his cross up to Golgotha, the hill outside Jerusalem, where he is nailed to the cross. The graphic details of Jesus' torture make the movie tough to sit through.Its primitive and pornographic bloodbath are definitely excessive that one may get turned off because of it.It was somewhat exploitative and caters to fans who are into blood thirsty scenes instead conveying a new spiritual message that would be applicable to present-day Christians.But inspite of it,Gibson created an inspirational and religious epic especially with the final scene having Jesus rise from the dead,which have made-up for the extreme violence the film has shown.",The Passion of the Christ

17,poolandrews,Not sure what to make of it.,7,25 March 2008,"The Passion of the Christ is set in Jerusalem where a prophet called Jesus Christ of Nazareth (James Caviezel) is arrested by Roman guards late at night after being betrayed by one of his disciples Judas (Luca Lionello). Jesus is taken to stand trial for blasphemy & stating that he is the son of God. Because of a large public uprising against Jesus he is scourged, then crucified & left to die...Co-written, produced & directed by Mel Gibson where does one start with the extremely controversial film that is The Passion of the Christ? Firstly I would like to point out that I am not a religious person at all & I will openly admit I have never even read the bible & I don't go to Church but even so I was curious to see The Passion of the Christ. It's probably fair to say that every single person on Earth who is old enough to actually see The Passion of the Christ knows the basic story of Jesus Christ & his crucifixion & therefore will probably go into it with at least a certain amount of expectation. For a start the entire film is spoken in either Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Aramaic, Latin or Hebrew with no English dialogue at all. Although subtitled the dialogue is actually rather sparse as The Passion of the Christ is all about imagery, beliefs & in particular a story with character's everyone already knows. At over two hours in length I must admit it felt a lot less, I found the story itself gripping & engaging although I have no idea how closely writers Gibson & Benedict Fitzgerald stuck to the source & that ending felt tacked on & like a cheap horror filmed cliché, is that what actually happened in the bible? Although often criticised for it's graphic violence it doesn't kick in until about the hour mark when Jesus is scourged in a sequence which will test the more squeamish viewers endurance before the crucifixion at the end. As a film I actually rather liked it but as a presentation of religious fact I can't say that I am qualified to judge it since I really don't have that much knowledge about Christianity.Director Gibson does a mighty fine job here, the film looks wonderful with immaculate production design & you really feel that your there. Gibson likes his slow motion shots, the film is littered with them although as I have already mentioned The Passion of the Christ is more about imagery than dialogue. The special make-up effects are very realistic & although not quite as gory as some people may have you believe it is pretty strong stuff especially since the character's & the story mean so much to so many people. Up to the point when it was released The Passion of the Christ had more pre ticket sales than any other film in history, unusually when it was re-released to theatres after it's initial run it went straight back to the number one spot & The Passion of the Christ is the both most successful 'R' rated & foreign language/subtitled film in US box-office history. Facts & figure that I bet no-one predicted.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 The Passion of the Christ is very well made with high production values & that Hollywood polish, set in Jerusalem this was actually filmed in Italy. The acting is very good although since everyone is speaking in a foreign language it's hard to tell for sure (for all I know they could be saying anything!), it's surprising that there are no big name stars in the cast.The Passion of the Christ is a film that I actually liked but not for any reason beyond that I though it was a good film that passed a couple of hours. Maybe those with strong religious belief's either way may have a harder time liking it or maybe they will like it even more, I don't know.

I am certain Mel Gibson feels for what he has done, but at the same time unless one feels as he does one will get very little out of it. Unless you come in knowing and feeling something for Jesus you are left to wonder why we should care about the man at the center of the story and what this brutality means. Simply put its a film for believers and all others beware. What you get out of it is what you put into it.It is nothing more than a mirror for our faith , and owing to the brutality of the film I am left to wonder what sort of people would want to see themselves reflected in its violence.

Covering the last 12 hours of the life of Christ it is nothing but a catalog of abuse that goes way beyond what is in the Gospels and what any man, divine or not, could ever hope to survive. The gore is over done and then some, but ultimately not convincing especially if you've witnessed other screen blood baths.There is no sign of humanity or Christ's message anywhere in sight. I left the theater feeling empty and unconnected, the feeling of ""thats not the God I know"" ringing in my heart.Some have said that what you get out is what you bring to it are wrong since I consider myself a believer and was bored to tears despite a deep desire to be moved. Gibson's hope that this will bring converts to his cause will not work since unless you know the Gospels you can't follow what happens.
It was a waste of two hours seven minutes, even if Monica Bellucci looks radiant.Avoid the film unless you feel you must punish yourself.",The Passion of the Christ
20,Bunuel1976,The Passion Of The Christ (2004) ***,7,3 April 2005,"Its many controversial elements aside, I found it undeniably harrowing in its violence but somewhat lacking in character development (Christ, especially, is presented as one-dimensional which doesn't allow him much empathy from the viewers, despite one's knowledge of how the 'story' went - surely not what Gibson intended!) though it does have unmistakable artistic merit, notably a number of striking images: the putrefied donkey whose rope Judas uses to hang himself, and the raven which comes to sit on the ledge of the cross and starts pecking at the bad thief's face (immediately after the latter 'provokes' Christ into doing one last miracle) were unexpectedly surreal touches; a bloodied Christ looking up at a white dove flying into the scene just after the scourging was almost poetic in its incongruity; God's tear falling from Heaven, and the recurring presence of an androgynous Satan, etc. In the end, it's not quite the definitive statement on the subject one would have expected (given the director's sometimes punishing fussiness over getting the details right above all else), and certainly not as challenging as Martin Scorsese's equally notorious THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ (1988)...or Robert Bresson's DIARY OF A COUNTRY PRIEST (1950), for that matter, which I rewatched the very next day - courtesy of Criterion's SE DVD - as a means of comparison, and which I found infinitely more absorbing, and moving, in its depiction of one (misunderstood) man's 'calvary' with its simple yet beautiful images and thought-provoking scenes of quiet despair, confirmation of faith, and the agony of impending death; another film I would say is a far better representation of Christian sentiment/assertion than Gibson's film is Carl Theodor Dreyer's masterpiece THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (1928; whose very title indicates that it too eschews Joan's 'history' for a thorough account of her final hours on Earth).",The Passion of the Christ
21,zardoz-13,"Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" is a cinematic revelation",10,13 March 2004,"Oscar winning ""Braveheart"" director Mel Gibson sets a whole new standard for Biblical epics in ""The Passion of the Christ,"" an inspiringly original but incredibly visceral account of the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth between his arrest in Gethsemane and his crucifixion at Golgotha. Everything everybody's told you about this two hour & six minute, sincerely-made, moodily filmed, but sadomasochistic saga rings true. However, ""The Passion"" does NOT qualify as remotely anti-Semitic. Sure, it is blatantly Anti-Pharisee, but not anti-Semitic. Anybody who calls ""The Passion"" anti-Semitic is naïve beyond belief. The anti-Semitism accusation is so general as to be inconsequential. You can condemn the actions of a handful of men (in this case the self-righteous Pharisees), but you cannot condemn an entire race of people (in this case the Jew) for the actions of a heinous few. Indeed, several Jewish characters in ""The Passion"" come to Jesus' aid. Labeling ""The Passion"" as anti-Semitic is as ludicrous as describing The Bible as anti-Semitic. Were these sentiments not sufficient, the central message of Gibson's ""Passion"" pleads for the audience to forgive your enemies.The violence registers off the Richter scale. The torture scene where the Roman soldiers compete to inflict the most damage on the Son of God gives new meaning to gratuitous violence. Okay, isn't violence in any form gratuitous? In this instance, gratuitous violence suits the situation, because the torture and crucifixion of Jesus were about as gratuitous as violence can get. Nevertheless, chances are you may not survive this torture scene, especially if you haven't seen a gory R-rated movie. The graphic crucifixion scene reminds us of the heartless savagery of public executions in New Testament times, too. Gibson must have spilled several gallons of Karo syrup mixed with red food coloring for this scene as well as the 45-minute flogging scene to emphasize the violence as it has never been stressed before in spectacles like ""King of Kings"" (1961) and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" (1965). Perhaps the only movie to rival Gibson's ""Passion"" for its documentary realism is the obscure 1966 Italian art film ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"" that portrays Jesus as an activist.The largely unknown cast adds to the authenticity. Actor Jim Caviezel's exploits as the cinematic Jesus have been well-documented in the news media. Indeed, he took an accidental lashing during the scourging scene and nearly passed out from the impact. Later, lightning struck him on the cross. Happily, throughout ""The Passion,"" Caviezel delivers a nuanced performance that never overshadows his messiah character. Unlike most Jesus movies, ""The Passion"" gives us a Christ who looks and behaves as an ordinary individual. This Jesus isn't a blond, blue-eyed loafer with shaven armpits in an immaculate white robe. Gibson shows Jesus the carpenter finishing up a table. When his mother Mary (Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern) brings him a bowl of water, he splashes it on her in an example of a playful mother a son relationship. This unusual scene of Jesus clowning is a welcome relief from those sanitized and solemn depictions of Christ as a man with no sense of humor. Earlier, Caviezel gives us a glimpse of Jesus' humanity in Gethsemane when he chides his drowsy disciples for failing to stay awake. At the same time, this Jesus is no weakling. During his first encounter with Satan, Jesus stomps the Devil's snake into the ground and gives Lucifer a dirty look. By the end of ""The Passion,"" Caviezel doesn't have to act and looks virtually unrecognizable under all the blood, gore, and crown of thorns. Aside from Caviezel, whose acting credits include ""Angel Eyes,"" ""Frequency,"" and ""The Thin Red Line,"" Gibson wisely cast no-name actors. As Mary Magdalene, a tastefully subdued Monica Bellucci of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is the only other big-name Hollywood refugee. Hristo Shopov takes top honors for his thoughtful performance as the conflicted Pontius Pilate, while Italian actress Rosalinda Celentano of ""The Other"" makes a creepy, androgynous Satan. She is enough to send a shiver up or down your spine. Collectively, however, the actors who impersonate the sadistic Roman soldiers give the movie its gut-wrenching quality with their savage shenanigans, especially when they flip the cross over to beat the protruding nails sideways. These guys give new meaning to evil!Loosely based on the Synoptic New Testament gospels as well as the book of John along with the Catholic Church's 14 Stations of the Cross, ""The Passion"" champions celluloid realism, but falls short of strict theological authenticity. Reportedly, Gibson also relied on the visions of two nuns: the 17th century Mary of Agreda and the 18th century Anne Catherine Emmerich. What ""Saving Private Ryan"" did for W.W. II movies; what ""Pulp Fiction"" did for crime movies, what ""Star Wars"" did for science fiction movies, ""The Passion"" does for Biblical epics. When the actors speak, they utter their lines in either Latin or Aramaic to give this chronicle a convincing sense of historicity. Don't worry, the subtitles are easily read. Ironically, for a movie about Christ, ""The Passion"" doesn't preach as much as you might expect. Instead, Gibson lets the visuals tell the story. He intersperses several flashbacks throughout, such as the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper, but ""The Passion"" focuses largely on the agony of Christ. If you watch movies for recreation, ""The Passion"" may be more than you counted on seeing. If your faith drives you to watch ""The Passion,"" you may find yourself sorely tested, particular when those Roman soldier wield their scourges. Whether you're saved or secular, ""The Passion"" remains a seminal movie for our times. Despite some minor technical flaws which you may miss because you're caught up in the action, ""The Passion of the Christ"" emerges as a cinematic revelation.",The Passion of the Christ
22,Boba_Fett1138,Very impressive...,8,28 September 2004,"With lot's of violence and visual beauty, Mel Gibson tells the story about the final hours of Christ.The best thing about ""The Passion of the Christ"" is how powerful it is, not only in terms of emotions but also because it's visual striking. It is a beautiful and powerful movie, that feels like an old bible painting. Most powerful scene for me was the ""Mary goes to Jesus"" scene because of the smart cuts between past and present and the powerful music. Who could have guessed that composer John Debney would come up with such a beautiful and powerful score. He didn't seem like a very likely choice but he really surprised me in a positive way.The characters are portrayed good, I especially like the portrayal of the devil. Although I can imaging that it can be confusing for some people to understand who all the characters are and what are their relations, it took me 2 viewings to fully understand who all those characters were.No, it's not really a perfect movie. The way the story is told is not always good. At times some of the events feel very stretched out. For instance, Jesus falls about 5 times when he is carrying the cross, each of those falls are filmed very dramatically, wouldn't 2 or 3 times have been enough? I think we all got the picture the first time that Jesus had a tough time. There are lots of other stretched out moments throughout the rest of the movie.Although not as good as I expected and certainly hoped it to be, it still left a big impression on me.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Passion of the Christ
23,evanston_dad,This Is What Everyone Got So Worked Up About?,4,26 April 2005,"I finally saw this film after everyone has said all that can be said about it, so I'll be brief. Expecting the absolute worst from Mr. Mel ""Sadist"" Gibson, I have to say that this film is nowhere near as good as its idolatrous fan base would have you believe, but neither is it as repellent as its detractors claim. In short, it's just a movie, not a particularly good one, with absolutely no emotional content and nothing in it to either explain what's happening or to make you care. It looks terrific---Mel obviously has cash to spare for his film-director-as-God craziness. But that's about where the praise ends. The whole thing has a nasty tone; in Mel's version of the tale, anyone who had anything to do with Jesus suffers nothing but misery, and while I'm not a believer myself, my guess is that's not the moral of the story as Jesus would tell it. And when Jesus marches out of the tomb at the end, eyes a-blazin' and military music blasting away on the soundtrack, I forgot for a second whether I was watching a film about Jesus or whether I had accidentally stumbled on to ""Braveheart Part II."" Mel Gibson is a wretched director, and the worst thing anyone can do with wretched directors is to take their work too seriously, for that gives them clout they don't deserve. All he's done here is turn a Biblical story into a horror movie, complete with creepy Satan babies and more shredded flesh than is on display in the entire ""Friday the 13th"" series. This stuff was camp 30 years ago, and it's just sad to see Gibson resorting to schlock effects in an attempt to make up for his movie's complete lack of narrative grounding. See this or don't see this, whichever is your preference. But religious or not, this film is not going to change your life. If it does, then you need to get a different one.Grade: C-",The Passion of the Christ
24,Uriah43,Exceedlingly Brutal,6,20 April 2014,"If the intent of this film was to depict the suffering that ""Jesus"" (played by Jim Caviezel) endured at the hands of both the Romans and the Jews then I would say that this was accomplished in an extraordinary-but exceedingly brutal-- manner. Further, since the film is based on a true story then it also falls upon the director to ensure that it meets a certain standard of historical accuracy as well. In that regard it has a few minor faults due mainly to the artistic license of the director (Mel Gibson)--and there is quite a bit of artistic license used in this movie. To begin with, one particular criticism of this movie made by many is that it is anti-Semitic. However, the fact is that the Sanhedrin wanted Jesus crucified. They demanded it. Pontius Pilate reluctantly acquiesced. So on this point the movie is basically correct. What the film doesn't show in any great detail are the reasons the Sanhedrin had in wanting Jesus put to death. Obviously, they rejected his message and his later claim to be the Messiah. But they were also concerned with their own positions which would have become more threatened with his rise in popularity. In my opinion, because the movie focuses almost solely upon the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, this movie fails to in bring everything into context. As a result, while this is certainly not an enjoyable movie or one that might illicit a favorable response from non-Christians, it may provide a deeper appreciation for the pain and suffering Jesus endured to those of the Christian faith. For that reason I rate it as slightly above average.",The Passion of the Christ
25,ferguson-6,Love one another,8,14 March 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Mel Gibson has been a bit on the quirky side during interviews for this movie.  It obviously is an extremely personal project for him and the final product is his reward. James Caviezel captures the spirit of Jesus and I soon found myself mindless of the fact that this was an actor.  The pain seems real.  Monica Bellucci and especially Maia Morgenstern are amazing in their depiction of the suffering with dignity endured by Mary Magdalene and the Mother Mary.  I must say the realism of the movie is very difficult to watch at times. Dirt, rocks, torture, blood ... none of it as we are accustomed to on a movie screen.  The portrayal of Satan is nothing short of creepy, even terrifying.  Overall, Gibson should feel proud of the film and hopefully the ridiculous arguments about anti-semitism will fade away.",The Passion of the Christ

We witness the sorrow as Mary can only stand by in agony as he is nailed to a cross. Then there is the controversial violence regarding severe beatings as Roman soldiers bloody Jesus to the point where he can barely carry his own cross. Ultimately we witness the resurrection! Fantastic directing by Mel Gibson with exquisite art direction and special effects. This is a triumphant followup to his Oscar winning work in Braveheart. Jim Caviezel brings out the anguish and love of Jesus who moves forward willingly knowing that mankind depends on his sacrifice. Maia Morgenstern as Mary is a mother who can only watch and reflect. Monica Bellucci plays the woman caught in adultery and whom Jesus saves from being stoned by accusers. Francesco De Vito plays Peter who means well but falls short when predicted as such.

28,The_Void,Visually stunning and amazingly powerful,8,27 September 2004,"Whoever or wherever you are is irrelevant; you have heard something about this film. The controversy that The Passion of the Christ has garnered is phenomenal, so much so that it has eclipsed the movie itself. However, unlike a lot of movies with heaps of controversy surrounding it's release; The Passion of the Christ has a great movie to back up it's bite with. As you know, the film's plot revolves around the final hours of Jesus Christ's existence on this earth. This is a story that needs to be told; Jesus is one of the most important and most talked about people to ever live, and the events surrounding his death are massively important to both history and religion. I don't know how close this movie has stayed to actual events, because I wasn't there; but I do know that it feels very real. Mel Gibson does a great job of making us believe that we are indeed in the year of Jesus' crucifixion, and overall realism is one of the film's key assets. It needs to be, of course, as the film would have been worthless if it didn't get that part right.Worthless is something that The Passion of the Christ most certainly isn't; and that is something that anyone watching the scenes in which this film gained notoriety for - the torture scenes, will be able to see. I'm not religious myself, to me Jesus is nothing more than any other historical figure; but it is impossible to deny the power of these scenes. Many film fans have condemned Mel Gibson for showing such grotesque violence being committed on Jesus Christ, but on the contrary; I think that Mel was right to do so. Providing that what is depicted in the bible is true (...), Jesus was indeed brutally beaten; so had Mel not have shown it, he wouldn't have been telling the story. Of course, some people would still say that the violence is over the top; but had any of it have been cut out, then the film would have lost some of it's power. It needs the shot of the hooks tearing away at Jesus' flesh to emphasize the brutality of the beating. It is also worth noting that although the violence is extreme, it's never perverse. We are with Jesus at all times, and are never made to feel delight at seeing him being brutally tortured. Throughout the film, we are with Jesus; we feel his pain and had these scenes have been toned down, the movie's power would not have been nearly what it was. I'm a man that enjoys seeing people being beaten in movies, and as mentioned, I'm not religious either; but even I was repulsed and disgusted by the events depicted here. Personally I don't think that criticising the movie for being violent is a worthy criticism.The film, in many ways, feels like a horror movie. Obviously the brutal beating is the main case in point, but also adding weight to this claim is the malevolent way that the devil (which is one of the best devil's I've ever seen in a movie) malevolently stalks various scenes, and the entire first sequence of the movie. That is a great sequence by the way; it's drenched in a blue-green tone, and coupled with the images of devil makes for a very eerie sequence indeed. The movie is packed with great visuals, the devil being just one of them; overall, it's a visual treat. Technically, the film is almost perfect. As I mentioned; it's very believable. Aside from Jim Caviezel and Monica Bellucci, the cast is almost totally made up of unknowns; and every single one excels. There's not a single person in the film that looks lost or out of place, and there's not many movies that you can say that for. One of the finest aspects of this movie is the score. It's amazing, quite frankly. Every single note is right on time, and The Passion of the Christ is one of the best examples of a movie that is made much more powerful by it's score. Without it's music, The Passion of the Christ would not grab the viewer even nearly as much as it does.Mel Gibson is a man that I've never liked. For such a big star, I could never get over the fact that he'd never made a good movie. That's all changed now of course, although I still don't like him; but I have to hand it to him here, as he's made a very good movie. His decision to film the movie in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew as opposed to the more user-friendly English annoyed me at first, however I do now find myself agreeing with Gibson's decision. The fact that the movie is in subtitles immensely adds to the realism, and although I do think that this movie would still have been great had it have been filmed in English, I'm no longer opposed to the subtitles. Mel Gibson was very bold in releasing this movie, and that is something that one has to admire him for. It is not an easy thing to do something that people are likely to look down upon, but Mel Gibson overcame opposition to bring this movie to the screen, and not only this; but he has brought it to the screen extremely well. Because of the fact that Gibson has obviously made the movie how he wanted it; we haven't had to suffer any of the usual Hollywood commodities, and what we have instead is an honest and unique piece of cinema. Kudos to Mel Gibson for giving us that.The Passion of the Christ is a film that is never going to be universally accepted as a great film, nothing this controversial ever will. Before seeing it, I was under the impression that it would not live up to its hype, and I almost didn't see it for this reason. However, the movie has not only lived up to its hype but surpassed it. Even if the film doesn't grab you, it is a movie that simply needs to be experienced by everyone, as there simply isn't anything else quite like it. Don't make the mistake I almost did.Just one thing though...I've never crucified anyone before but I think you'll find, Mel, that the nails go through the wrist.",The Passion of the Christ
29,mm-39,The best movie so far this year.,10,12 April 2004,"Spoilers  So far, this year is a bad year for movies.  Until The Passion of the Christ came out this year is the most forgettable for movies.  This movie is a 10 because it is made so well.  Directing, acting, lighting etc. If the viewer never understood Roman corporal and capital punishment they will after seeing this film.  I pray the Rosary, and Tuesdays and Fridays meditations is on the crucifixion, and I believe this is where Gibson bases this film on.  The viewer better understands the sacrifice Jesus made for man, and the trials and events that unfold during Good Friday.  This film is directed exceptionally well,  if one did not read the sub-titles they could still follow the story because of the pace and direction of Gibson's film. Is it realistic? Yes very much like the meditations themselves.  Should everyone see it?  No not young kids.  Will it win any awards?  It should win best picture but leftwing Hollywood would never politically do this.    The realism of Gibsons interpretations is helped with great details.  The guard whos heart changes, after Jesus heals him. The brutal guards enjoy their work, one can understand why these guards where chosen for this job. They do it so well they get into trouble for over doing it. Judas anxiety is believable.  These minor details give this film creditability.  The location is excellent; I wish too visit this town one day.  Pilots  handling the situation is shown extremely well, Pilot has the best performance of the show.  I know that I understand the crucifiction better after viewing this film. 10/10",The Passion of the Christ
30,SimonJack,"Great acting, research and details make a great film",10,27 April 2014,"All aspects of this film, ""The Passion of the Christ"" are excellent. The technical values, shooting and film quality, costume and makeup, screenplay and directing, cast and crew are outstanding. For a film with relatively few lines for its length, the quality of acting is even more important. The leads are all exceptional – Jim Caviezel as Jesus, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, and Monica Belluci as Magdalen. The roles of the Apostles, Pontius Pilate, his wife, the high priest, and Herod are all very good. For a real take on the quality of casting and directing, look at some of the lesser roles – the Roman soldiers, for instance. One scene shows the excellence of several men in their roles as soldiers. During the scourging of Jesus, two soldiers begin with reeds for whips. They stand behind Jesus on either side, and alternate their strikes. After so many lashes, Jesus is weakened and falls to his knees. The two soldiers stop, exhausted. One is bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for air. The other, breathing heavily, wipes saliva from his mouth. They, and others standing around them have looks that may be empathy for the beaten figure of the man before them. But then, Jesus struggles to his feet, his hands shaking and writhing in pain as he pulls himself up off the ground. Now we see a marked change in the soldiers. They have looks of scorn at this prisoner's defiance of their beating. We can see – almost to the point of imagining the feelings ourselves – the anger welling up within them. Now they have looks of contempt, bitterness, and hatred toward this beaten man who has withstood their beating. So, now they take to the horrendous and brutal weapons of flogging. Now they will teach him a lesson. There will be no mercy for this man.No movie before has shown the depth and detail as has this film of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ. To some, it's too brutal and gory to watch. And, it's certainly not for young children. But for those who want to learn about and better understand the Gospel accounts of the last half day of Jesus Christ on earth, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is an excellent portrayal. Mel Gibson produced, directed and co-wrote the screenplay for the film. He relied on a book, ""The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ,"" to fill in many details of the Gospel accounts. The book was edited by author and poet Clemens Brentano, and based on his interviews of a mystic, Anne Catherine Emmerich. She was a nun who lived from 1774 to 1824, in a convent in Germany. She spent the last years of her life bedridden. She had spiritual ecstasies, including visions of the life and death of Jesus. She later bore the physical marks and pains of the stigmata on her body. These were examined by church officials and later by secular medical experts, all of whom confirmed the wounds as authentic and unexplainable. History books and encyclopedias attest to the type of scourging depicted in the film. A number of scientific and medical books about scourging and crucifixion have been published in the past few decades. One of the best is a book by Dr. Frederick T. Zugibe, 1929-2013. The former chief medical examiner of Rockland County, NY (1969-2000), was one of the most prominent forensic experts in the U.S. His ""The Crucifixion of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry"" was written after decades of research and updated in 2005. Another, with more historical details, is ""A Doctor at Calvary,"" by Pierre Barbet, M.D., 1953. Gibson and company took extra steps to add to the accuracy and reality of time and place. The movie was made in the languages spoken in Jerusalem 2,000 years ago – Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin. It also has English subtitles. Lengthy research went into the dress and customs of the time. Experts advised the crew on language, the culture, and other details during the filming.The film received three Oscar nominations, for cinematography, costumes and makeup. There were some other very good movies in 2004, but consider those that won Oscars in these categories. Cinematography and costume went to ""The Aviator,"" and makeup went to Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events. ""Passion"" wasn't nominated for directing or editing, but consider this film against those Oscar winners, ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Aviator,"" respectively. Many extraordinary things happened in connection with the making of ""The Passion of the Christ."" Viewers will see a strange name in the credits for the film at the end. Jan ""Lightning Boy"" Michelini, was a young assistant director for the film. He was struck directly by bolts of lightning two times – a year apart, during outdoor filming for the movie. The second time the lightning also flashed to Jim Caviezel who was standing near him. Jan had been holding umbrellas over crew members when it began to rain each time. The lightning burned the umbrellas and passed through him into the ground without hurting him. He had burn marks on his fingers but was OK otherwise. Caviezel also was unharmed. When was the last time you knew of someone who was struck directly by lightning and survived alive, and unharmed?""The Passion of the Christ"" is a film like no other. It's surely the best Bible movie ever made. To hundreds of millions of Christians around the world, it is one of the greatest love stories ever made into a movie. And to movie buffs everywhere, it has to be considered among the best acting, historical and technical films ever made.

32,JamesHitchcock,"Emotionally Powerful, but....",8,30 May 2004,"According to orthodox Christian belief, the Crucifixion was the central event in the history of the world. On the Cross, Christ took upon himself the sins of all mankind and thereby made possible their salvation. Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ' which recounts the story of the Crucifixion and the events leading up to it is quite explicitly made to reflect orthodox teaching. When seen from this orthodox viewpoint, the two criticisms that have been made of the film- that it is too violent and that it is anti-semitic- do not seem relevant. Certainly, the film is graphically violent, showing the sufferings inflicted on Christ in an unflinching way. The violence, however, can be justified by the importance of the film's theme. Crucifixion was undoubtedly a most brutal and agonising method of execution, and there is a tradition in Christian art of showing Christ's sufferings graphically in order to emphasise the enormity of the sacrifice that He made on behalf of humanity. (Matthias Grunewald's Isenheim altarpiece is a good example). This film is simply following in that tradition. As for the charge of anti-semitism, the historical fact is that Christ was crucified by the Roman authorities for their own political reasons, one of those reasons being a desire to placate elements within the Jewish religious hierarchy who saw His teaching as a threat to their position. The orthodox Christian teaching, however, is that Christ was metaphorically crucified by the whole human race, because it was for their sins that He died. To claim that either the Jews or the Romans are solely responsible for Christ's death, therefore, is to miss the point. As others have pointed out, Christ and his followers were themselves Jews, as are all the sympathetic characters in this film, with the sole exception of Pilate's wife. Even St Veronica (the woman who wiped Christ's brow) is shown as Jewish, despite her Roman-sounding name (a derivative of the Latin for 'true'). The wicked characters are both Jewish and Roman. I did feel that the film was rather too lenient on Pontius Pilate, portraying him as a decent but weak man manipulated into executing Christ against his will. (Historical evidence suggests that he was regarded as excessively brutal even by the standards of Roman colonial officials). It cannot be said, however, that the film tries to exculpate the Romans as a whole. The actual torturing and killing of Christ is carried out by Roman soldiers, who are shown as going about their task with sadistic relish, not with the demeanour of unwilling men forced to perform an unpleasant duty. Jim Caviezel is appropriately dignified in the role of Christ, but it would be difficult to single out any individual acting performances, except perhaps for that of Rosalinda Celentano in the role of Satan, here portrayed as a silent but sinister epicene presence. The film is attractively photographed; the interior and night-time scenes have a dramatic chiaroscuro quality reminiscent of much religious art, while the outdoor daylight scenes, shot in southern Italy, have an authentically dusty, sun-bleached Mediterranean feel. The dominant tones are brown, grey and pale blue, which makes the red blood stand out in contrast during the scenes of torture and crucifixion. The film's few false notes seem to come whenever Gibson departs from the Gospel narrative, such as the rather ridiculous flashback in which Christ is shown inventing the dining suite, or the repellent scene where the impenitent thief has his eyes pecked out by a crow. (I say 'repellent' because of the implication that God takes the same pleasure in inflicting physical punishment as do the human characters). The use of ancient languages has been criticised by some as a gimmick, but I found that it added to the film's strange, solemn atmosphere, although if Gibson was aiming for authenticity, I felt that he should have consulted a philologist on the likely pronunciation of Latin in the first century AD rather than relying on an anachronistic Church Latin. The film was made with obvious sincerity and has great emotional power. Many Christians on this board and elsewhere have praised it as a beautiful expression of their faith. Some have expressed the hope that it will be a vehicle for evangelism. I doubt, however, that it is likely to be effective in winning converts. My own difficulties with the film are connected with my own religious position, which can best be described as one of unitarian deism. While I have great respect for the teachings of Christ, I believe that the full truth about God cannot be expressed through the theological doctrines of any religion and that many of the propositions of Christianity (and of other faiths) are best understood as metaphors rather than as literal statements of fact. Unfortunately from my point of view, 'The Passion of the Christ' centres upon two of these propositions- the doctrine that Christ was, literally, the Son of God and that He died in order to save mankind from its sins. I therefore found myself unable to respond to the film in the same way as the orthodox believer who accepts these doctrines unquestioningly. The film concentrates almost exclusively on the Crucifixion; Christ's previous life, His mission and His teaching are alluded to in only a few flashbacks, the Resurrection in one very brief shot and the events which followed the Resurrection not at all. In my view this is a mistake. Earlier generations, who perhaps had a greater understanding of Christianity than we do today, might have found it easier to accept passion plays and other artistic works that concentrated on a single aspect of the Christian story. In our age, when the prevailing attitude towards Christianity is as often one of ignorance as one of positive scepticism, that story needs to be presented in its totality. The uncommitted viewer of this film will not see Christ as a profound moral and religious teacher, but simply as a man who died a violent death, and may come away with the impression that Christianity is a religion concerned with death rather than with life and love. For my money the best film about the life of Christ is still Pasolini's 'Il Vangelo secondo Matteo', which presents the whole Gospel story in a simple, unaffected manner. 'The Passion of the Christ, despite its emotional power, does not have the same spiritual depth. 8/10",The Passion of the Christ
33,StevePulaski,Sees through my skepticism in religion,10,26 March 2012,"I am not a religious person. If you know me, you know my views have been reduced to ""I have no proof who or what exists, and I don't plan to get involved any time soon."" I wasn't raised religiously, despite both of my parents having some sort of religious upbringing. I'm glad I wasn't. I believe religion is an idea and concept one should pursue and study if they want to when they get older. Rather than being dragged every Sunday to a place of worship, being almost forced into beliefs, it's much more effective to allow a kid when he's older to form his own beliefs.I've come to the consensus over the years that I don't need religion. I have been successful without it for many, many years. I have published over five-hundred reviews, written many blog posts, volunteered at an organization, helped many people in my life, am constantly thankful for what I have, and have earned the respect of the people I care about. If I was your son, I think you'd say I'm doing a good job. I'm a free-thinking human being who looks to himself to solve his own problems. Not a book, not a verse, not a prophecy, not a prayer, or a story.Am I an Atheist? I don't think so. I have no proof there is/isn't a God. I have never seen him, I have never spoke to him, and I continue to bask in the area of skepticism. I think the idea of religion has been ghastly blown out of proportion in the last several years. People forget that religion teaches you to respect others beliefs and remain mature to other people despite their possible differences in faith. Now, many people who look to religion stew in their indulgence, thinking that others are ""crazy"" or ""stupid"" for believing in multiple Gods, not favoring a monotheistic position. I'm not saying every religious person does, but organizations like the Westboro Baptist Church have taken the meaning of God and have hypothetically spat on it. I've grown tired of all the fuss, controversy, ideas, and backlash religion brings. If it has helped you, keep believing in it. I don't need to hear about it. I'm comfortable enough in my position.But that's not to say I barricade myself in a cave, not allowing any religious ideas to flow. I'm open to films that focus on biblical aspects. I think even if we don't believe in something, we shouldn't shelter ourselves off, not allowing the other side to speak. If you're against abortion, do you immediately shun everything pro-choice? I believe many people do. By doing that, what can you learn? What can you accomplish by sheltering yourself? I try to watch a number of films, regardless of political, social, or religious beliefs. I believe the only way we can truly have an opinion on something is by seeing both sides of the argument, their benefits, and how they'd be applied.I decided to watch The Passion of the Christ for two reasons; one, to say I saw one of the most controversial films of all time, two, so I can further explore the work of Mel Gibson. He has successfully filmed a brutal journey, unlike one I have ever witnessed. I'm sure many others share that same view too. Going into this film blind will do no good. This is a brutally honest depiction of the treatment, brutality, and crucifixion Jesus Christ endured. It is bloody, unapologetic, gory, gruesome, and very, very cruel as it depicts the last twelve hours of Jesus's life up until the very lengthy scene of him being nailed to the cross.Gibson has filmed what many directors have avoided. Despite the negativity, death threats, harsh comments, and heavy, heavy controversy surrounding the film, Gibson's persistency and efforts must be commended, if not, cherished and admired. This is not only a vast achievement for filmmaking, but for religion as well.Jesus is portrayed by Jim Caviezel, in what I believe is his first major film role. What a debut, right? He is astonishing, avoids painful overacting, and it seems every time he slashed with a whip or a stick, the pain affects us audience members. We feel as we are being hit with every last weapon, unlike in many action films where characters take abuse and we feel no emotion, sympathy, or even sorrow. Just amusement. Here, no amusement is to be found. This is a melancholy take on a melancholy event. I've been to some online discussions where people have gone as far to say Jesus's crucifixion was ""bloodless"" and ""painless"" on his behalf. This will be probably the rudest awakening of their life if they actually believe that.Gibson is clearly religious, but he doesn't live in the clouds about his faith. He is aware of the hardships most likely endured by Jesus himself. He is fully capable in delivering a very brave and commendable film, that some will most likely not even watch till the credits. Those who do may not even hesitate to flinch afterwards and watch the entire credits all the way through. I know I did.The Passion of the Christ, even to a sacrilegious skeptic who rejects nearly every religious belief, is an astonishing film and a game-changing motivator to religious and biblical filmmaking. Despite the film's persistency showcasing cruel events, the main moral, as stated by Gibson, is love and forgiveness. Although I can definitely see what he means, you will not see any of that during the film itself. Nor will you even think those words.Starring: Jim Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern, Monica Bellucci, and Hristo Shopov. Directed by: Mel Gibson.",The Passion of the Christ
34,Smells_Like_Cheese,Words could never describe this film,10,12 March 2004,"""The Passion of the Christ"" was beyond intense and disturbing. I could not believe my eyes and what I was seeing. This was the first time for everything in a theater that I have seen.First, I was crying histerically. Usually, I don't cry that much the first time I have seen a film. Secondly, I was screaming ""Stop hurting him!"" at the screen. That was how much I was into the film. Third, my best friend was holding my hand to her head. She kept covering her eyes. Fourth, people were walking out crying and saying ""I can't take it anymore!"". There were screams during Jesus's ""punishment"". There is a lot more to describe. But that would take a while.
The movie is incredible. Brilliantly made, intense acting, and very painful scenes to watch. I was a little surprised at this movie not being on the top 250. Who knows, maybe after a while, people will get used to it.I probably won't see this again, because it was too painful to watch. It's like ""Schindler's List"", a wonderful movie. But you can't watch it over and over again.Congrats, Mel. You've done it again.10/10",The Passion of the Christ
35,MovieAddict2016,Well made.,7,29 March 2004,"Mel Gibson's third directorial project is a stunning example of powerful film-making. Gibson has literally gambled everything on ""The Passion,"" and it has certainly paid off. As a film, graded against other epics, ""The Passion"" stands strong. If you can leave your religion (or lack thereof) at the door, and see this movie as it is intended to be seen, its power is undeniable.The movie is unflinching in its graphic nature, yet more hesitant at times than some would have you believe. Take, for instance, the scene where Jesus is whipped. Once we've seen enough, Gibson pulls the camera away and focuses on the face of a spectator, and we simply *hear* the lashes. ""The Passion of the Christ"" has come under attack for being the ""most violent movie ever made."" It is not. I also didn't find it to be Anti-Semitic, which has been another criticism thrown against it. Is the film enjoyable? About as enjoyable as something like this can be. It's more of an artistic statement, I'd say, and I admire the technical aspects and commitment and passion invested into the project (no pun intended). I'm not sure it's something I'd want to watch very often, but I'm glad I saw it.",The Passion of the Christ
36,OllieSuave-007,"Faithful, gripping, amazing.",9,13 March 2014,"Actor Mel Gibson directs an unforgettable film that details the final hours of Jesus Christ, leading to his crucification. The story itself was gripping and rousing, captivating the audience; I remembered that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, absorbing my attention entirely. The acting was superb - all the cast members provided the right amount of drama, character development and substance in the film. Benedict Fitzgerald and Mel Gibson wrote a screenplay that really captures the faithful and spiritual message of Christ, and the social and political dynamics of the Romans and Sanhedrin. Caleb Deschanel's cinematography work on the film was brilliant, beautifully capturing the artwork, scenery and atmosphere of Italy of that time. And, John Debney wrote a rousing musical score that is perfect for the ensuing drama and power within the motion picture.The scenes depicting Christ's torture and crucification are so intense and detailed that you couldn't help but feel the pain with him and be moved by all the tormenting and struggles he endured. This is a definitely not a film for everybody to watch considering the high amount of gruesome and disturbing sequences, but its message of faith, salvation and God's love should be resonated to everyone. Grade A",The Passion of the Christ
37,sddavis63,"Possibly The Best ""Jesus"" Movie Ever Made",9,6 March 2004,"In my opinion, Mel Gibson's controversial labour of love about the trial and crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth is a clear winner. I can't say that I was overly enthused about seeing it (I was quite willing to wait for its video release or even Pay TV debut) but my wife wanted to see it, and so we trooped out to the theatre today. Absolutely no regrets. This is a fantastic movie. It features a haunting musical score that stays with you, spectacular sets that convince the viewer that you really are seeing 1st century Palestine, a narrative that is close enough to the biblical narrative to make the subtitles (the movie is spoken in Latin and Aramaic) almost unnecessary if you know the biblical account, and James Caviezel provides a superb portrayal of Jesus.The movie, of course, is controversial. Some find it too violent. It IS violent (but then again it IS about a crucifixion.) I didn't find the violence gratuitous at all, but those who are squeamish about the sight of blood might not want to see this. Some find it anti-semitic. I suppose if you go in with the pre-conceived notion that it's anti-semitic, and you're looking for anything that could be construed as anti-semitic to prove the point you'll find something (but that's similar to the danger of proof-texting, for those familiar with biblical criticism.) I actually thought the Romans came off far worse than the Jews. The Jewish leaders struck me as serious men who really thought they were doing their religious duty and who found it unpleasant to do and were uncomfortable with what they had done. The Romans, on the other hand, are portrayed in a quite bloodthirsty manner. They not only inflict Jesus' sufferings; they take great delight in doing so. So, is this movie anti-semitic? I think not. (I commented to my wife afterward that ""The Passion"" is as anti-semitic as ""Schindler's List"" was anti-German. I stand by that comparison.) I also think that those who are loudest in condemning this movie are probably like many of the fundamentalist Christians who years ago condemned ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (which I also thought was an excellent movie): they've probably never seen it.There were some things I didn't like about this movie. I thought that the portrayal of Satan was just silly and quite unnecessary to the story (I stand to be corrected, but I don't recall Satan making an appearance in the biblical narrative of the passion.) Some of Gibson's ""extra-biblical"" material also struck me as less than credible. I just couldn't buy, for example, Pilate's wife Claudia bringing towels to Mary so she could wipe up Jesus' blood after his flogging. So, it loses a point for some extraneous material that just didn't need to be there.The greatest testimony to this movie, though, was the silence that greeted it. Dead quiet in the theatre while it was on, and - even more astonishing - dead quiet as people filed out. Clearly, people were affected by it and were processing it.This movie will not be to everyone's liking (obviously), but as far as I'm concerned, it's a winner: 9/10.",The Passion of the Christ
38,Buddy-51,Flawed but Compelling view of the Via Dolorosa,7,20 January 2005,"Is it possible for anybody to be truly objective about Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ""? Has any movie ever stirred up this much ""passion"" on both sides of any one issue? Devout Christians embrace ""The Passion"" as the ultimate illustration of God's love for humanity, believing that by dramatizing so vividly the physical agony of Christ's last moments on Earth, the film brings home the high cost of the sacrifice in a way it has never been brought home before. Since film is a largely visual and emotional medium, ""The Passion"" has an advantage - even over the gospel accounts themselves - of being able to convey the unimaginable brutality of 1st Century crucifixions and to make us vicarious participants in the suffering. On the other side of the cultural spectrum, many nonbelievers and skeptics see the film as a bewildering exercise in sadomasochistic savagery, as a man is basically tortured to death for two hours while millions of viewers worldwide queue up for the privilege of witnessing it.As an agnostic on the issue of Jesus myself, I confess that I can see both points of view fairly clearly, although, on the whole, I think ""The Passion"" is a pretty impressive cinematic achievement. What makes this film different from most previous versions of the story - even more so than the unprecedented intensity of the movie's violence - is the fact that ""The Passion"" concentrates almost exclusively on the last few hours of Jesus' life. By showing virtually nothing of Jesus' pre-passion ministry, the film does feel as if it is missing a fairly crucial dimension to the story. Even the resurrection is treated almost as an afterthought - a bit of a cheat, actually, considering how much suffering both Jesus and the audience have had to endure up to that point. Gibson attempts to filter bits and pieces of the back story into his movie through the use of very short flashbacks, but anyone unfamiliar with the gospel tale may find himself confused and bewildered and questioning what the purpose of all the suffering really is. Perhaps unintentionally, the message of Jesus tends to get lost on the blood-soaked road to Calvary.Certainly it is the graphic nature of the violence that will be most remembered about this film and I think, in this respect, Gibson took basically the right approach. The unflinching portrayal of Christ's suffering is infinitely preferable to the sanitized, ""tasteful"" way in which it has been depicted in most previous films on the subject. It is possible that the director may be guilty of some overkill in this area, but, for the most part, the unremitting brutality is the film's strongest point. It does lead us into questioning just why a loving god would require such a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, but, then, that is an issue for theologians, not a movie reviewer, to consider.As to the issue of whether or not the film is anti-Semitic in nature, that, too, depends on how one looks at it. Surely, Jesus and his followers were all Jews and they, needless to say, are portrayed in only the most sympathetic light by the filmmakers. Unfortunately, Caiphas and the other Jewish leaders in the film have been reduced to little more than stock villains, shaking their fists at the camera and crying irrationally for Jesus' blood all throughout the picture. However, since this is the way the story is told in the gospels, the charge of anti-Semitism is virtually unavoidable in any movie dealing with Jesus' life. For the same reason, Pontius Pilate comes across in the film as a much more reasonable, conscience-wracked victim of circumstance than historians like Josephus would ever have portrayed him.One can also question the decision on Gibson's part to add Satan to his cast of characters in the guise of a hooded, hissing, androgynous figure more appropriate to a cheap horror film than a serious drama. Of course, one can understand why Gibson felt compelled to do this. After all, by limiting himself solely to the passion scene, he must have realized that he was left with no opportunities to portray any of the neat miracles Jesus is said to have performed. Thus, the director had to find a way to inject something of the supernatural into the proceedings; otherwise the film might have come across as just a movie about a guy being pounded to a pulp by a bunch of misguided sadists.On a technical level, Gibson has done a superb job recreating the time and place of the story, with his inspired use of Aramaic and Latin lending a harsh reality to the scene. The makeup work is truly extraordinary and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel brings out the stark beauty of the ancient background against which this gruesome drama is played. As Jesus, Jim Caviezel cuts an impressive figure and sure shows that he can take a punch with the best of them. Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Francesco De Vito as Peter and Hristo Jivkov as John get to do little but look teary-eyed and concerned as Jesus makes his way through the crowd. Hristo Shopov brings some humanity to the role of Pilate, though Luca de Dominicus makes of Herod a mincing, campy caricature.There is a certain irony in the fact that the most commercially successful R-rated feature to date has achieved that prominence largely through the patronage of people who have been the most vocal critics of such films. Perhaps the Lord does indeed work in mysterious ways.As films about the life of Jesus, I much prefer Passolini's ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"" and Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" to Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" but this latest version of the tale, despite its many flaws, brings its own unique vision to ""the greatest story ever told.""",The Passion of the Christ
39,sol1218,Powerfully Gripping & Deeply Moving Motion Picture,10,27 February 2004,"I saw ""The Passion of the Christ"" the other day at a neighborhood theater and have to say this; Never in my life was I so moved as well as emotionally drained and left speechless from a movie like this movie about the last day of Jesus Christ. When the movie ended and the lights went on as the credits rolled up there must have been some two hundred people in the theater with me and you didn't hear a word from any one of them. The stillness in the movie-house was that of shock as well as hope in what we all saw on the screen the previous two hours and ten minutes. The Story of ""The Passion of the Christ"" Jesus' last day on earth, Good Friday, is well known to all of us. The Bible which the movie is based on is available to anyone who wants it in book stores libraries places of worship and is given out free to anyone who wants it by dozens of religious organizations all over the world. Seeing it on the big screen and being directed by Mel Gibson with what you can only call an inspired cast was the most overwhelming experience that a person could have attending a movie in a theater or anywhere else.The story is about Jesus' betrayal capture trial and crucifixion but it's far more then that, it's a story about hate love hope and forgiveness. Critics who protest the films brutal violence seem to forget that practically all the violence in the movie is directed on one person, Jesus. They also seem to forget that the violence and death of Jesus, taken from the accounts of the Gospels, is meant to show how horrible and inhuman violence is not to enthrall and whip up those watching the movie into a violent frenzy. Like in the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"" when the violent and brutal Alex is forced to see hour after hour of the most violent films imaginable in the end he was completely cured of his violent urges and became a normal and no-violent person and even the very thought of violence made Alex sick.""The Passion of the Christ"" is a movie about love hope and redemption in a world of hate fear and despair much like the world that we live in today. We can all thank Mel Gibson for spreading THE WORD that the Bible is not obsolete and that THE WORDS of those in the Bible, like Jesus, are not unrealistic and out of fashion and to be forgotten in these modern times. There have been reports in the press that a number of Hollywood big shots have reportedly put out the word that Mel Gibson's days of making and directing movies in ""this town"" or anywhere else in the motion picture industry is over. What these arrogant snobs are going to find out very soon is that Mel Gibson by making movies like ""The Passion of the Christ"" is going to own ""this town"" and they'll need him instead of him needing them for a job. With the movie blockbusters that Mel's been making over the last ten years from ""Braveheart"" in 1995 to ""The Passion of the Christ"" this year he can not only write his own ticket but his own check too.As if it were the second coming of Jesus the movie ""The Passion of the Christ"" came into thousands of theaters in what can only be described as a miracle straight out of the Bible. Mel Gibson has made a movie about the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus with 25-30 million dollars of his own money with a cast of unknowns and not only in a foreign but long dead language, Latin and Aramaic, with sub-titles.Those who are running Hollywood are in a panic everything that they did to first stop the movie from being made and when that didn't work from being released. When that failed they tried with the help of their allies in the media to get the public turned off from the movie and not go see it. When that flopped they finally as a last and desperate resort tried to threaten those making and distributing and acting in the movie with professional and financial ruin and even that misfired. Everything that the big shots in Hollywood did to derail the movie ""The Passion of the Christ"" turned out to be a complete and total failure just like the messages that they've been putting out to the public all these years of sex and violence and greed and selflessness. We can only thank Mel Gibson not only for his vision and how it inspired him to act but for the vision itself that gave Mel the courage strength and will to see it through after all these months of taking the worst abuse that those in Hollywood and their supporters in the media and elsewhere could muster against one person.Like an irresistible force of nature dispersing and scattering every obstacle thats put before it THE WORD has come down from the mountain and the world of those in power that control the publics hearts and minds and lives and even souls will never be the same again.",The Passion of the Christ
40,ElMaruecan82,Suffering in Slow Motion ...,10,17 February 2014,"""The Passion of the Christ"" isn't for any audience, or for any mindset.If you're easily unsettled by depictions of graphic violence -violence here being an understatement- make sure your faith will strengthen your heart hard enough so the eyes can follow. I'm not only speaking about Catholic faith but the intimate conviction that the figure of Jesus Christ is perhaps one of the most significant to have ever changed the face of the Earth, the course of History, and this comes from a non-Christian person. The mindset now, 10 years after its release, we're all aware of the vivid condemnation the film received for its depiction of Jewish priests, that seemed to flirt with the most blatant and shocking cases of anti-Semitism. To get it straight, if you want to see anti-Semitism in Mel Gibson's film, you will find it. If the very idea that Jewish people could ever be portrayed as antagonists in a film upsets you, then you will clearly despise ""The Passion of the Christ"". But is the blame on the film for having respected so literally the Gospels in portraying the people who gave one of their own to the Romans?Isn't also the criticism unfairly overlooking the fact that most of the characters in the film are Jewish, and the vast majority is seen capable of empathy, and I'm not just talking about those who converted, how about Simon, who helped Jesus carrying the cross? How about the fact that the film is so scrupulously obedient to the 'divine script' that it evens shows Peter in a totally different light, rejecting the Christ almost three times, something I wasn't aware of. The accusation of anti-Semitism is not only fallacious but dangerous. The film is a movie with obligatory antagonists, Priests who have legitimate reasons to fear the Christ and get rid of him, they happen to be Jewish, because for God's sake, that was the only monotheism Christianity could threaten.This is a false trial against Mel Gibson in order to turn the ""Passion"" into a sort of modern-day ""Birth of a Nation"" and that didn't prevent the film from being one of the highest-grossing of the year anyway. There was a response to the film, something it called for, sometimes driven by faith, curiosity, and certainly word-of-mouth ""The Passion of the Christ"" was the phenomenon of the year 2004, along with the film ""Downfall"" both again facing the same criticism, while one was guilty of being too unsympathetic toward Jews, the other was too sympathetic toward Hitler. My juxtaposition is of two wrong accusations that only discredit whoever uses them, exploiting lobbying influence to kill artistic expression.I guess, I'd have approached the Catholic themes of the film more if I had the faith, but I can't do without denouncing the double standards disguising censorship under the fallacious mask of 'anti-Racism', much more 'anti-Semitism' which is the worst allegation that can even threaten an artist's career. I wish I was wrong but the controversy surrounding Mel Gibson and the way it poisoned the nominations of his following ""Apocalypto"" only prove my point. Till now, the only director authorized to go as far as he wishes on the field of violence is Quentin Tarantino. But I'm sorry; a character like Shoshanna Dreyfus, a Jewish refugee who becomes a James Bond femme-fatale-like heroine is far more outrageous than anything from ""Christ"" or ""Downfall"".Now, let's get to Gibson's undeniable talent as a director, already demonstrated in ""Braveheart"". Gibson has a way with violence, an inimitable aesthetic sense in realism; I can't really put a better word on it. It doesn't look flashy and stylish, a whip gets hooked on the skin, almost removes a part of it, with no special effect, nothing except well-chosen close-ups and painful editing. Sometimes, the gesture hurts even before the contact, and it's only a matter of a few seconds. And the reaction of the victim is the emotional pay-off. This is suffering in slow motion, which makes ""The Passion of the Christ"" the perfect title for 'passion' derivates from the Latin word, meaning suffering, a word befitting the Christ for being the One who sacrificed his life for Humanity.But 'sacrifice' is only a word, and words are words. They're written, on the blank coldness of a white page, the ink stares at us, and we can't see through it. Gibson put pictures on words, he shows the last day of the Christ on earth with an attention to all the multiple details that made his journey absolutely devastating, his suffering showing not in the acts of violence, but in the eyes of the spectators, from Mary to Magdalen, from the apostles to the Jewish priests themselves. And the audience reacted because it had forgotten; Christians underestimated their understanding of words and finally rediscovered the roots of their faith, from a believing director. And it's his absolute right to make a personal story about the person he admires the most, regardless of the way he was exploited by controversial figures.Bush admired Jesus, but Jesus would have wept and sided with the Middle East, the same land that saw the birth of the Aramean language, spoken in the film for more documentary-like realism. The title echoes ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", where Joan's last temptation to abjure was finally abandoned when she admitted to be the messenger of God. In Martin Scorsese's film, the point of the Last Temptation was to show that Jesus was a man. In Mel Gibson's film, he's the Lord BUT he's also a man, which makes his suffering, bleeding crying even more painful As as painful as his 'Lord, why have you forsaken me?' that really sent shivers down my spine, the cry of a boy abandoned by his father.It's for effects like this that Cinema was invented, and Gibson is one of the most crafted and sadly misunderstood film-makers today.",The Passion of the Christ
41,dromasca,"too much controversy, too little inspiration",6,4 September 2004,"After some hesitations, because of the non-artistic emotions this film generated, I decided to post a comment on this film, as I am doing about all films I see. After all, it does plays in commercial theaters, cashes money, and may compete in the Oscars race. I have read about this film a lot, much before it was released, and much before I saw it on DVD last night. (It is not being screened in Israel, and I doubt it will be screened soon - at least not in commercial theaters). I am sorry to say, but my fears from previous commentaries and discussions were mostly confirmed. The film is quite bad, it is far from being inspirational, and it risks to generate more hate than love, although this may not have been the intention of the authors. The level of directing is below the average historical Hollywood stuff, the acting is average, with the exception of a great act from Maia Morgestren in Mary's role, characters do not develop, and for those less familiar with the Christian iconography most of the logic, historical facts and personalities remain an enigma.Mel Gibson may be very serious about his faith.

Mel Gibson creates a few tangents with flashbacks and a pointless Judas Iscariot story though but they're not enough to distract from the bore of Jesus' torture. And it's not even that bad in terms of gore. I've seen worse, a LOT worse. But as 90% of this film is in slo-mo the torture and punishment is sensationalized rather than realistic and harrowing. I kept yawning, looking at my watch to see how long was left. I'm sorry to say that I just did not care for this film, I feel completely indifferent. From a technical point of view it's well made, but it's boring and pointless.I've never been able to understand the logic of 'Jesus (who isn't even called Jesus in this, not even phonetically. Where did the name Jesus come from?) died for our sins'. And there's no explanation here. He died (if he really existed) BECAUSE of our ignorance and stupidity if anything.TPOTC is no more than an overblown, overrated film about the genesis of an overblown, overrated, God-fearing religion.

It is too long, pretentious, conceited (I'm not sure if it's the right word), morbid, stereotypical, in one word - yuck! After this, I think Gibson is a sick man, because a mentally healthy person could not design such a thing. If it was meant to be a horror or some sick drama like ""Serbian Film"" and such, I could understand, but it is not.

45,ironhorse_iv,Christ! That's movie is way too gory for a Christian film! It's hard to watch!,7,27 March 2016,"While, I have to agree with the South Park TV Show creators, Trey Parker & Matt Stone, by saying this controversial graphic account of Jesus's last 12 hours on Earth was indeed mostly torture porn. I do have to furthermore say, this R-rated film directed, co-produce, and co-written, by Hollywood actor, Mel Gibson was also well-shot. The cinematography is amazing, but it is kinda ruin by the movie overused of slow-motion. Its symbolism is very forced and clichés. Filmed with dialogue in three languages (Aramaic, Hebrew, and Latin) with English subtitles; the acting in this movie is really good. Jim Caviezel really does look and feel like Jesus Christ with the cool make up work; to the point that the actor really get struck by lightning when shooting the Sermon on the Mount scene. I guess, God didn't like that. Nevertheless, most of that performance, from him is just Caviezel doing moans and groans, while, acting in pain. So, it add well with the rest of the film. I just wish, the supporting cast was as memorable, as him. I can't hardly remember any of them; besides Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, whom story isn't told, very well. Wouldn't scenes with Judas Iscariot (Luca Lionello) & Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov), be more awesome, if their history with Jesus, was, you know, explore more. For a film that claimed that the events is authentic and 'truthful'; it doesn't really tell all of the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, or the insomnia and grievance of the Blessed Virgin Mary from the Bible that well. Still, I do like the changes, here, like what they did with Pilate, with having a morally conscious than his normal self in the bible. However, you would think the movie would do, its research, and learn that Jesus carry the patibulum (cross-arm); not the entire cross to his death site. Plus, Jesus was nailed to the cross, by his wrists, rather than his hands. The palms cannot support the weight of the human body, and as a result the nails will strip out between the fingers. I wish, they knew that. I didn't like that. Nor did I like the ending, which show not much of his story of resurrection. It was little too brief for my taste. Nevertheless, the two accounts that wasn't needed for the film is the visions of two nuns: Mary of Agreda (1602-1665) of Spain and Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774-1824) of France. It's clearly not accuracy, at all, since there is no claim that they honestly saw anything, related to events, hundreds of years, earlier. Another thing, that bug me, is the lack of backstory. Yes, it was cool to see, that he has taken up his father's trade of carpentry in the scene of him, fixing a chair, but that is far, too short for a movie that has a guy, we support to care about get whip to death. Yes, I know, that his life has been debated by historians & theologians, but still, couldn't the movie show anymore of duration of his public & private life than that? I also found it, funny that Mel Gibson also asserted that the film's goal was to inspire, not to offend anymore. Clearly, this movie indeed anger people. Not only, because the film's excessively graphic scenes of flagellation, torture and crucifixion; but also the way, the movie's negative portrayal Jewish people. As much, as people hate how the Jews were shown in this movie, as a critic, I found that everybody on screen, no matter, what race, they are, is equally portray as unlikeable. The Romans are shown in the film to be over cruel & sadism & the Arabs actors act like thefts. So, to say, that the Jews are the only ones to be offended is a understandment. Still, it got so much, backlash, that there were several boycott lead by Anti-Defamation League (ADL) to pull the movie, out of theaters, because of how anti-Semitism, it was. The plan, didn't work, as the film went on to be the most successful R-rated film ever, with $370 million US box-office receipts (on a budget of $30 million), mostly due to the multiply viewers by evangelical church groups. It also became the highest-grossing independent film of all time (at the time). Nevertheless, Gibson did had some difficulty securing a distributor for his film: until he did more edits, removal of about 5 minutes of graphic violence for the DVD version. However, an unrated, re-edited re-release of the film named 2005's The Passion Recut was released afterward, & also shown in theatres for a short time a year late. Since then, the praise of the movie has somewhat die down, due to Mel Gibson's 2006's drunken angry tirade about the Jews, women, and race-related. Even with that, the movie does sport, a higher rating, compare to most Christian-based films. Plus, at one time, it even got free advertised on a NASCAR racecar. Overall: This movie is not a bad film, at all, however, this self-financed, independent film is far from good as well. It's just way too over-violence to be, a film that supposed to be teaching Jesus's moral message. It's mediocre, at best.",The Passion of the Christ
46,The-Sarkologist,What is cool about this movie is that it is in two different dead languages,8,28 December 2013,"This is the third time that I have seen this movie and the thing that always stuns me about it is that it is made entirely in two dead languages – Aramaic and Latin. As a passion play this movie is absolutely superb, and it is also impressive that Mel Gibson, who is much better known for being an actor than a director, was the guiding force behind this movie. This is not surprising due to Mel Gibson's strong Catholic faith. However there are a couple of criticisms that I do have with it (and they are somewhat minor).The first is the scene where Jesus has finishing constructing a table which I though was basically stupid (and incredibly anachronistic). To me it felt as if this was supposed to be a bit of a comic side step, but this is not the type of movie to have comedy in it. The reason I say that is because modern tables were simply not used or needed in that day and age, and despite Jesus being the son of God, I find it quite unbelievable that he would actually make a style of table that would not appear until at least the middle ages (people in those days ate lying on their sides from tables that were quite low to the ground).The other issue I had was when Jesus and Pilate were talking, and it was in Latin. Now there is a debate as to whether Jesus actually spoke Latin, though scholarship does agree that he would have been fluent in Aramaic, and would have also spoken Hebrew (the gospels suggest that this is the case because he was able to read the scriptures, which were written in Hebrew, and was also able to debate with the priests, who spoke in Hebrew on religious issues). However it is debatable as to whether he spoke Latin (and if he did speak a third language, it would have been Koine Greek, which was the lingua franca of the region).Some people have suggested that because he is God made flesh, then he would have the power of God and thus would be able to speak any and all languages as will. However, we must also remember the passage in Philipians in which we are told that he emptied himself of the power of God and submitted himself to death, even death on a cross. Now, (for those who actually believe the gospels), we do accept that Jesus performed miracles, and thus being able to communicate with a foreigner in their native tongue, fluently, would simply have been another miracle. However, we need to be aware that at this particular point in time Jesus was not performing miracles. In fact there were people (including, I believe, Herod) who were calling for a miracle, and thus for Jesus to speak to Pilate in fluent Latin would have amounted to a miracle, something that I cannot accept as happening at that particular time.Now that I have got that off of my chest, I can return to what I said originally and that this is a pretty good version of the passion play, though at times I felt that it was a little too graphic, and while it is great to help us understand the suffering that Jesus experienced, I felt that at times it was going a little too overboard.",The Passion of the Christ

I mean, really, what is there to say about the movie that hasn't already been said?? Some found its extreme violence distracting and excessive (I'm one of them, truthfully) as well as claiming that the film subliminally promoted antisemitism. I'm not sure about the last part, but it is insanely violent (easily the most violent Jesus movie of all time) and at times I struggled to watch it, and even felt physically sick!! In spite of criticisms that the movie was anti-Semitic, it was a huge hit ending the movie the 3rd highest grossing movie of 2004, only behind Spider-Man 2 & Shrek 2. It outgrossed animated kids movies The Incredibles, The Polar Express and A Sharks Tale, as well as the popular Meet The Parents sequel, the second Bourne movie and the third Harry Potter movie.This was a huge gamble by Gibson, and it paid off.  The studios wouldn't touch it, so he was forced to release the movie himself.  So when it turned out to be one of the most profitable movies of all time, grossing $612 million against a $30 million budget, $370 million at the domestic box office, Gibson got to keep the lion's share of the profits.This movie made Gibson a little less popular in Hollywood, but it didn't look like he cared one bit.",The Passion of the Christ

49,Movie Nuttball,One of the greatest movies of all time! The Passion Recut Comment!,10,2 September 2004,"The Passion of the Christ is an excellent and wonderful film! I am impressed with not only Mel Gibson's directing this epic but also the time he took to make this film. Jim Caviezel was the perfect choice to play Christ. His performance was excellent. You can feel his pain and suffering. He was so believable. He is an incredible actor! Everyone that is in this film also performed really well! The graphic violence is so real looking and I am amazed how wonderful this movie is! No one in the film speaks English in the movie but I think this was a very wise choice to make it even more realistic! The music by John Debney is great! Everything looks real! If you love Jesus and want to see Mel Gibson's extraordinary direction that I strongly suggest that you watch The Passion of the Christ today!---------------------------I had the chance to see the Passion of the Christ Recut on 03/15/05 at our huge local cinema and in My opinion this was a chance of a life time! I am very thrilled that this epic film is once again shown on the big screen! I have said My opinions in the above paragraph but I will say a couple things. Jim Caviezel is so spectacular as Jesus. John Debney's musical score is extraordinary and it sounds so awesome in the theater. It was an incredible experience and I would love more and more movies shown in the theaters especially some of My favorites. If you have a chance to go see a movie within the next couple of days choose to see The Passion of the Christ because of its greatness, epicness, great action, excellent musical score, and for many other reasons! I strongly recommend The Passion of the Christ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE:There was only two other people in the cinema watching The Passion.

50,zkonedog,Will Give You Pause To Think About The Reality Of The Crucifixion,8,12 March 2017,"Until I saw this film, my visual representation of the events that transpired during the crucifixion of Jesus Christ was confined to TBN specials or staged Passion Plays, where the crown of thorns is made of styrofoam, the ""blood"" is red food-coloring, and the nails go in between the fingers, not through them. That all changes with ""The Passion of the Christ"".I don't want to get into the nit-picking of this film, as in all honesty I do not have a strong scriptural grasp on all the passages that director Mel Gibson tries to portray, but instead I view it from just one perspective: Beginning with the night that Jesus was taken into Roman custody until the stone was rolled away from the tomb, this film is a very visceral interpretation of one possible scenario that may have played out. It is sort of like a ""historical-fiction"" telling of the crucifixion story, as no one knows exactly what transpired.From a plot perspective, the film doesn't at all delve into the meaning of Jesus' crucifixion (to save the world from their sins so we can join him in heaven someday), but takes a ""just the facts, m'am"" approach to the story. Jesus is captured by the Romans, tried by King Herod and Pontius Pilate, beaten mercilessly and humiliated, and then crucified...the end. The violent acts committed during these scenes are startling, to say the least, yet they do shed light on how difficult a process this was for Jesus to endure, as (at the time) he was confined to a mortal body and bound by its limitations.Thus, if you are at all squeamish about bloody violence, steer clear of this film at all costs. However, if you are a veteran of, say, the ""Saw"" films and would like a more realistic portrayal of the single most important moment in human history, this is your film.",The Passion of the Christ
51,johnnyboyz,"For every brutal scene, there is a sense of engrossment and for every act of violence, there is a genuine response from the audience.",7,20 December 2008,"Is The Passion of the Christ a good or even great film because it's so harrowing and so effective; or is it absolute garbage consisting of strung together scenes of brutality and humiliation no one really needs to witness as part of a film going experience. I'm going to have to veer into the realm of the positive for this one because I didn't get that reaction many might to do with the film being one, long, arduous procession of human misery. I use the word 'human' lightly, principally due to the final shot which Gibson inserts complete with a certain part of the body confirming who we assume it to be looking slightly different to how we last saw them, which pushes the film into a boundary or genre of the mythical or, and it'll sound odd, the science fiction.But that's not to say the bible is all lies or 'fiction'. How do you place the bible as a book into a genre? With film-making, most films will carry a certain label or 'type' and when you have such a bizarrely structured film with the sort of content you get in The Passion of the Christ, placing it into a genre is difficult. Likewise, the final shot of the film, in filmic terms, notches the piece up a crank and prods it into a realm of the uncanny or of the science fiction because it ends as a fable showing human beings or beings resembling human beings achieving feats that are impossible.As a straight up adaptation of events told to people of generations after generations gone by, The Passion of the Christ works. It works on a dramatic level, on an emotional level and on a shock level. The film has no real natural arc on which its protagonist will undertake their journey but it puts whatever hero it does have through a grinder somewhat unique in the sense I don't think there are too many scenes like there are in this that have ever previously been put to film. The film begins in an immediate fashion. There are people in a small wood, at night, and others of a higher order come to arrest one of them. What follows is a meek trial under supervision of the Romans and a crowd baying for blood before a sentence of some sort is carried out in which Gibson allows to take up most of the runtime through to the end.The condemned is, of course, Jesus Christ (Caviezel). He is supported by disciples Magdalen (Bellucci); John (Jivkov) and Peter (De Vito) as well as his mother, Mary (Morgenstern) following a betrayal by Judas (Lionello) and the consequent arrest. The chain of early events allows Gibson to just let loose, particularly following the sentencing after which Christ is flogged many, many times before the pain is cranked up and that distinct feeling overcomes you that things will get worse before they get better, primarily when small, metal hooks are placed at the end of each 'claw' on the whips used.The film seems to carry a strong undercurrent of censorship. Nobody makes a film like this one without wanting to either say something or draw our attention to something, with Gibson it's pain and violence. Some scenes in the film are an ordeal but they ask us a question or at least force us to ask ourselves how long we can take watching the content presented. It is a similar question posed to those withn the film. For a good half an hour or so, the angry priests demand Jesus be punished or crucified for his outlandish claims he is the son of God and the king of the Jews. The priests must watch the pain inflicted as the whipping begins and some cannot bear it as much as others. It's this sort of self censoring that reverberates as a theme and, perhaps, is the sort of question Gibson is posing and adapting to the real world. How much longer can the instigators of pain stand by and watch the suffering going on before they realise what they have done with their outlandish statements. As far as film adaptations of events go, The Passion of the Christ is no masterpiece and it does raise certain questions. But the slight beauty of it is that it may well be Gibson pointing out the absurdity of it all anyway. It relates to the idea behind the priests still desiring to see Christ crucified despite the brutal flogging because of his ill talk. They accuse him of attempting to brainwash and deceive certain others but surely the mob are brainwashed or blinded by the 'greatness' of religion themselves if they deem crucifixion is a still worthy enough punishment despite all the prior pain. Do they not stop and think what God Itself would do or say at times of these? Do they not reckon the man confused more-so evil for saying such things? Surely wanting to see a badly beaten individual further tortured is no desirable means of God or any of God's followers.It would be easy to praise the film for its effectiveness as on a basic level of film-making, it works. The cinematography is bleak and dreamlike; opening with navy blues before opening up into browns and golds combined with the blood red that is drawn from Christ at various points. The finale to do with the crucifixion is as harrowing as it is unnecessarily poignant given whose hands actually attach Christ to the cross. But the film remains powerful and engrossing with a final shot that haunts in all its uncanny glory.",The Passion of the Christ
52,filipemanuelneto,The real suffering of Jesus,10,11 June 2016,"This film tells the final week of what is the greatest story ever told. The last teachings of Jesus Christ, His suffering, His death and finally the suggestion of His resurrection. Directed by Mel Gibson, which also provides the script along with Benedict Fitzgerald, it stars Jim Caviezel and Monica Bellucci.This film has been seen as Christian propaganda by some people. It doesn't seem the case. If its agreed that Jesus existed and was crucified and scourged before He died, then this film shows exactly what probably we would have seen, if we were there. And this is true for Catholics and Protestants, believers, non-believers, religious and atheists. Jesus lived, preached a message revolutionary for His time and was killed for it. Everything else depends on the faith of each one but, being the film based on the Bible (which is the main source of information about Jesus), obviously it would have to portray the resurrection in the end, even if merely suggested.Another criticism I have heard a lot about this film is its huge graphic violence. I don't understand that. Upsets see how Jesus suffered but didn't bother to have video games and horror movies even more graphic? Our current society has a very severe point of view about violence but forget that it was part of everyday life for thousands of years, and its not possible to conceive Roman times without violence. Thankfully, we live in another way but we shouldn't ignore the past or forget what we have passed to change our collective mentality.I think Mel Gibson did a great job as director. Its good to see that he has learned from his mistakes, as did some lamentable movies in the past (""Braveheart""). The option for absolute historical accuracy was certainly his choice, as the decision to faithfully represent biblical texts, compelling in all that relates to Jesus, not only by tradition but also by the absence of other sources. I loved listening to the original languages ​​(Aramaic and Latin, in particular), I think it gave to the film an additional realism. Caviezel was intense and exceptional in his role, managing to convey the pain and suffering, but also the love and sweetness of Jesus' heart. It was an injustice not to have earned the nomination for the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, at least. The makeup and costumes work was exceptional and shined by its realism. The scenarios also helped to portray Jerusalem in that period, a city that isn't very different from the current city. The picture is very good and the special, visual and sound effects were great and help the audience to enter into the film, following the pains of Jesus until the end. The soundtrack, written by John Debney, is undoubtedly one of the best ever made for film in the XXI century.",The Passion of the Christ

54,leplatypus,The passion of Mel (dad),10,1 October 2017,"As soon as the movie begins, you feel that Mel was really inspired by this subject: the camera movement, the colorful set and the presence of the devil for me, that was perfect because in a lot of production about religion, the devil factor is generally forgotten while it's the main cause of the pain of humanity! Then, the choice of limiting the scope of the movie to the Passion aka the crucifixion is wise because we can take time to behold what happens and ponder about this holy week end: for sure, Jesus punishments were violent, bloody (as inspired by the devil) and I don't understand why we should be avoided this reality: torture is about pain and cruelty! It's the same thing about antisemitism: Jesus was put to death because of the Jew temple priests so Mel can't direct anything else than this fact except if you want a story that fits your own beliefs and interests (and Jesus life is all about this oriented choice of materials..) As a kid, the french movie of Golgotha (1935) terrorized me and put me in psychological distress because it opened my mind about the death reality (now I found this original to have learn about our mortal condition with a movie about a resurrected messiah!). I just wish today kids won't have similar experience with this one! At last, if this Jesus is sometimes too dark with his answers and prayers, the movie offers an amazing definition of goodness, that is totally relevant today for everyone: to love its enemy! The good man is thus not the one who kills the bad guy who wants to kill him as we kept hearing today but who helps him out of love to be respectful of the treasure of human life! As Jesus says, it may be hard and impossible but without this difficulty there can't be no reward! To conclude, the last scene of the resurrection ends the movie like it has begun with another incredible inspired moment of filmmaking that says it all, full of poetry and humility that goes straight in the heart!",The Passion of the Christ
55,howard.schumann,"Hheavy handed, emotionally draining, and lacking in spiritual feeling",4,29 February 2004,"In times of great change, people's religious beliefs often become polarized, veering toward either extreme fundamentalism or very personal experience. Over the past few decades, a spiritual movement has arisen that encourages people to look inward for truth rather than relying on external authorities. Now Mel Gibson has countered with the Passion of the Christ, a powerful but bombastic film that restates fundamentalist Christian beliefs about how the death of Jesus atoned for the sins of mankind in excessively graphic terms. The film chronicles Jesus' accusation of blasphemy from the Jewish High Priests to the trial overseen by Roman Governor Pontius Pilate and his eventual crucifixion at the hands of the Romans at Golgotha but restricts the message of his teachings to a few unconvincing sound bites. The cinematography of Caleb Deschanel shows in explicit detail how Jesus was whipped, scourged, mocked, spat on, had spikes driven through his hands and feet, and was left to die on the cross. Use of the original tongues of Aramaic and Latin add realism while special effects such as female demons, satanic children, and a sinister figure screaming at the heavens lend a dark and surreal touch but seem strangely out of place. The film opens in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus (James Caviezel) is praying alone, fearful of what he knows is his fate. A black-coated Satan hovers around tempting him to surrender while his disciples have fallen asleep and Judas (Luca Lionello) collects his thirty pieces of silver from the temple guards. The film heats up when Jesus is arrested and hauled before the Sanhedrin High Priest Caiaphas (Mattia Sbragia) to stand trial for blasphemy. In the crowd are Jesus' supporters including John (Hristo Jivkov), Mary Magdalen (Monica Bellucci) and Mary, beautifully performed by Maia Morgenstern. In touching sequences, the relationship between mother and son is shown in flashbacks from the time Jesus was a child to the present when she runs to help Jesus as he slumps to the ground.Unfortunately, however, every character except Jesus and his followers is portrayed as bloodthirsty, hysterical, and corrupt with the exception of Pontius Pilate (Hristo Naumov Shopov) who is depicted, contrary to biblical accounts, as a suffering saint, perplexed and shocked by the crowd's brutality. Whether or not the film is overtly anti-Semitic is questionable, but Passion Plays for centuries have reinforced the notion of collective Jewish guilt for the death of Jesus and have created a climate for anti-Semitic acts. At the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1988, bishops issued recommendations urging producers not to show ""a teeming mob"" calling for Jesus' death. These recommendations are violated in Passion of the Christ which shows a vacillating Pilate give in to a bloodthirsty Jewish mob demanding Jesus' crucifixion. This is followed by ten minutes of exaggerated blood-soaked violence as Jesus is tied to a post, whipped with a stick, then sadistically flayed again with a whip that has metal barbs at each end, his flesh torn out by the hooks. When he is finally nailed to the cross in slow motion hammer strokes, we breathe a sigh of relief because emotional numbness has taken over and we know the end is close. Gibson self-servingly describes his film as ""the most authentic and biblically accurate film about Jesus' death"" and says that he used excessive violence to help us to better understand the sacrifice Jesus made for humanity. This completely ignores the fact that the biblical accounts of the trial are contradictory and do not contain details of the punishment except to say that Jesus was ""scourged"".
Whether it ""is at it was"", or it is as it never was and never will be, I found Passion to be heavy handed, emotionally draining, and lacking in spiritual feeling and Caviezel's performance lacking in presence and conviction. Jesus spoke with clarity, wit, and eloquence about man's unbreakable connection to his creator and saw the potential for humanity to live the truth without guilt. In the Beatitudes, Jesus blesses those who hunger and thirst after justice. His intended result was not to incite anger but to enhance our capacity for love and forgiveness. If the purpose of Gibson's film is to stun audiences and encode images deep in our psyche, he has succeeded, yet his legacy may be to destroy decades of interfaith relationships and our view of religion as a tool for bringing people together.",The Passion of the Christ
56,TheMovieDiorama,"The Passion of the Christ feels ""holy"" unnecessary.",5,21 December 2018,"This wasn't for me. Regardless of my religious views, this biblical drama was style over substance. I wanted to be absorbed by the devotional writings that Gibson expertly adapted. I wanted to empathise with Jesus Christ as he slowly carries an overburdening crucifix on his blood-soaked body. But ultimately I kept thinking ""why?"". Of all the biblical stories to interpret, the Passion of Jesus lacked reasoning for its existence on the big screen. Primarily covering the final twelve hours of Jesus' life, we witness the Messiah sacrifice himself for the removal of humanity's sins. Only for him to then perform the miracle that both his followers and sceptics were waiting for, resurrection. Gibson's directing style, the production value and Caviezel's physically demanding performance cannot be undervalued. The Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin dialect enhances the authentic ancient world that Gibson portrays. I must also state that the many many scenes of brutality certainly made me flinch and did make for a difficult watch. Yet, I didn't particularly enjoy the film.The excessive violence was distracting, masquerading the lack of content that Gibson failed to provide. It is a two hour film, yet over half of it featured Romans whipping Jesus to amplify the enormity of his sacrifice. But the absence of character development (and yes, even Jesus still needs it) meant that it was all for nothing. Both sympathy and empathy were not present, making the whole ordeal feel more like an endurance test. Some may argue that this was the film's purpose, to which I counter argue by saying ""why?"". We as an audience get nothing out of it. If the story is hollow, to which it is, then we are unable to truly feel the emotional turmoil that Jesus experienced. Uplifting? Not in the slightest. Bellucci as Magdalene was underused, focussing more on the grievance of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The portrayal of Jews, whilst unintentional, did perceive antisemitism to a small degree. The narrative conveys the sins of humanity, but did occasionally feel like it was targeting Jews. Nevertheless, excluding my own personal views on religion, as a film I failed to understand its purpose. Jesus' final hours fails to convey the religious teachings that he abided by, instead focusing of excessive brutality. Resulting in an endurance test of biblical proportions.",The Passion of the Christ
57,Tweetienator,Mel Nailed It,10,19 July 2018,"This is probably the most uncompromising film that gives us an insight about the last days of Christ, his doubts, his temptations and his suffering. 
Alone the scene were the mother must watch her son being brutally whipped by Roman soldiers is heartbreaking and imo the best scene ever made regarding the last days and the suffering of Christ (no matter if you believe in him being the son of God or not).In my opinion this is more a movie about how much pain a human being can bear and how cruel and/or mindless people can act to another fellow human being, as a movie about a religion, of religions or theological questions.Great directing, great acting, great visuals, great story - imo the greatest masterpiece by Mel Gibson made/directed.",The Passion of the Christ

It's also a physically draining experience. It's a movie that stays with for days (or longer). I first saw this movie in the theater (Regal Westbury, NY). I've seen it quite a few times since. I don't watch it as much as I should because its impact is so strong that it takes me a while to recover. There's no way it can fit into a living room double feature. No other movie can match the power of ""The Passion of the Christ"".",The Passion of the Christ
59,Anonymous_Maxine,This must have been tremendously difficult for Gibson to make.,10,1 February 2005,"Given how strong Mel Gibson has revealed his religious beliefs to be, it is astounding to me that he was able to make this film as graphically and powerfully as he did. ""Okay, now this time when you whip him with the flog, the barbs are going to stick into his back, and then you rip it out and blood and skin will fly everywhere."" Gibson makes no effort to hide his desire to show the world the sheer extent to which Jesus suffered. Shivers run up my spine when I even think about the concept of crucifixion, and that's not even all that Jesus suffered that day.Roger Ebert made an interesting comment in his review that related to my own experience of the movie. He explains that anyone raised as a Catholic will be familiar with the stops along the way. I wasn't raised Catholic myself, religion in general was and remains a very minimal part of my life, but I watched the movie with a friend of mine who spent 12 years in Catholic school and he was yapping on and on during all the dramatic scenes in between the torture and crucifixion, explaining to me who was who and what was going on. The best part was that after the film was over, my friend said that he heard that Mel Gibson wasn't even going to bother with action films like Payback or Lethal Weapon or anything like that anymore, that he only wanted to make meaningful films like this one. I checked online and guess what the next movie was on Mel Gibson's to-do list  Mad Max!At first I wished he would shut up but his explanations were actually pretty helpful and it made me think that there are probably a lot of people who would watch this movie and really miss a lot. On the other hand, this is one of those rare movies that speaks its message loud and clear even if you don't know who every character in the movie is, because there are many important people who receive minimal, if any, character explanation.But this movie is about exactly what the final hours of Jesus Christ's life, as Christians believe it, it's not a sermon and it's not a film adaptation of the Bible. The movie borders on getting preachy as it intercuts between Jesus' torture and crucifixion and flashbacks of him talking to his followers about how he is the way, the life, and the light, but it is such a powerful film that such things are forgivable. True, the movie is about Jesus and what he believed and stood for, but I tend to think that we already know that without having it shoved in our faces like that. The power of the rest of the film gives me the impression that such things are unnecessary. In this case, I think it would have been a case of less is more.I am not the one to consult on the historical accuracy of the film, but the power with which it describes the final hours of Jesus' life will affect people regardless of their beliefs. Even more, however, I think it's a film about the disastrous cruelties that humans so willingly inflict upon each other, and more importantly, about the irrelevance and hypocrisy of the Church. I've always been fascinated with the old question, ""If God is everywhere, why do you have to go to church every Sunday to talk to Him?""The film is not about Jesus being crucified for what he believed in as much as it is about him being crucified to please the crowd. Granted, the crowd wanted him crucified for what he believed in, but consider this  they wanted him crucified because of their fear of the Church, which wanted him crucified because he flew in the face of their establishment as the sole means of connection and communication with God. Overall, the movie is about human beings doing horrible things to each other, and the saddest part is the glee with which the people greeted Jesus' torture and crucifixion.As I watched the film I was reminded of all of the conflicts that have occurred in human history in the name of religion, and how today, after thousands of years of bloodshed, we are not an inch closer to peace than we ever were. The Passion of the Christ is undoubtedly the most violent portrayal of Jesus' life that has ever been put on screen, and while I am not a religious person, I genuinely appreciate the massive amount of debate that the film has created, it's one of the most important functions of the cinema. The movie is almost physically painful to watch, and I'll probably never watch it again because of that, but Mel Gibson has indeed created something powerful and meaningful. That it has been ignored by the Academy Awards is certainly telling, because this movie certainly deserves to be recognized and rewarded.",The Passion of the Christ
60,jzappa,A Deeply Moving Portrait of Mob Mentality,8,8 May 2015,"I sat down on a day off to browse the streaming content on Netflix. The Passion of the Christ appeared. I hadn't seen it since 2004, and I was compelled to revisit it by my acknowledgment of the fact that times have changed so much that such an inflammatory movie event is now something you can watch on your laptop while sitting on the toilet. When I first saw it, I was 16, a casual viewer with ADHD and a gore hound. I went to an arts school full of liberal hipsters. My interest was piqued by the notorious level of ultra-violence in the film, and rented it from Blockbuster despite the equally notorious allegations of anti-Semitism attached to the film.Eleven years later, as a 26-year-old atheist and movie buff with staunch liberal views, I still don't see a referendum on Jews. I still don't see a guilt trip about what Jesus did for me. But I also don't merely see an exploitative gore fest. I see a portrait of mob mentality at its most primal. Neither the Jews nor the Romans are portrayed as monoliths; several centurions are outraged by the unabashed sadism of their colleagues, and while it can be argued that the Jews when portrayed as a group are viciously vindictive, the individual Jewish characters range from prototypical Old Testament zealots to compassionate but helpless characters who suffer along with the eponymous victim.I am aware that the proof is in the pudding in regards to Mel's view of the Jewish people, not to mention multiple other long-established prejudices of his. Still, I never did, and still do not, see this film as anti-Semitic, but in fact quite the standard depiction of Christ's execution according to the Christian faith. This is the story we were all taught in church, whether you honestly believe he rose from the dead or not. If you are like me, you will see it for the mythology that it is, a legendary fable of a great ancient leader's martyrdom, much like another great cinematic epic by Gibson, Braveheart, which similarly shows a well-intentioned man in one of human history's most brutal eras summoning his people to take on the fascistic compulsions of their cruel overseers, and nobly accepting an awfully unenviable price for it.I doubt it's the intention of a die-hard Christian like Gibson, or the remotest interpretation of many of the ideological folks for whom the film's release meant so much, to emphasize the universally relevant bandwagon effect of the masses that played a seminal role in the savage butchery of Jesus, but I suspect many atheist and agnostic viewers are moved by that theme. After all, it's the religious intolerance of the Jerusalem establishment that led to the breakthrough discipline of his teachings, and thus his indictment. It was the authoritarian influence of the Roman Empire that enforced that zealotry and allowed such sadism to strengthen the loyalty of brutal henchmen.There are many people I respect who dislike this movie because they feel that the explicit particulars of Jesus' torture make it too unpleasant to bear and eclipse any message it's attempting to send. I don't understand that viewpoint. The message is the torture. Passion involves hardship and torment. Christian theology, upon which it's no mystery that the movie is based, extended the word to have to do with Christ's love for humanity, which compelled him to agonize and die for humanity. You watch The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, guess what you're going to see?The Middle East in biblical times was a Jewish community overrun by the Roman Empire, and Jesus' message was equally alarming to both, one because he was a revolutionary, and the other because he preached a new covenant and endangered the status quo. His passion came about because of the same conformity and fear of change from which society has learned nothing, like today's Catholic bishops who are reluctant to denounce abusive priests or acknowledge the trend, evangelicals who muddle religion with politics or Muslim clergy who are silent on terrorism, all of whom have a stake in their status and power. You can see it in police forces who protect officers who shoot unarmed black men, news networks that omit reports that compromise the reputations of their shareholders. The passion of Christ is the passion of every historic reformist who took one for the team.",The Passion of the Christ
61,Captain_Couth,A dude getting whipped for two hours...not cool.,1,14 August 2005,"The Passion of the Christ (2004) was nothing more than Mel Gibson getting some pent up release out of his system. Why would anyone want to watch a dude named Jebus get his butt handed to him for two hours? Passion plays were put on for one reason, to anger the blood (this is coming from a Catholic). I don't see the point of this movie. I viewed this film as a personal snuff film for the man who based his entire action film career imitating this man. Gibson is a hypocrite. Unlike other actors of his similar faith (Patrick McGoohan) he's violated his own Church's dogma and flaunts it every time.Technically the movie was sound. But I wished Gibson followed his original plan and released the movie without sub-titles. I mean the people who are his main draw already know the ""passion"" play and what's it all about. I hope Mister Gibson has got it all out of his system. I couldn't stomach another mockery of the church and his twisted view on religion. The people who paid to see this film were just as bad. Buying tubs of popcorn and dragging little children to see a movie about a man getting scourged, chastened and finally hung out to dry.I am glad Hollywood wasn't deluged with Christian movies. Because there's already a niche market for those films. Not recommended at all.",The Passion of the Christ

It is from it's often disputed pages one compares the different books by the Apostles. Not to belabor the point, the story of the Christ is subject to the eye witnesses of the various accounts and events in the life of Jesus. In this movie "" The Passion of the Christ ', director Mel Gibson has gone into the once forbidden realm concerning the death of Jesus. Growing up Catholic, we were taught there are no actual facts concerning his death, only faith, theories and conjectures. Yet, upon seeing this dark drama, there is little left for the disbelieving soul to argue with. Indeed, watching the entire black film without sickening revulsion, object pity or tragic sympathy with the most heart-wrenching scenes, one must have a steel heart or no compassion at all. James Caviezel plays Jesus and does so with remarkable ability. Christo Jivkov and Francesco De Vito are John and Peter. Luca Lionello is Judas and Hristo Shopov is Pontius Pilate. Once the terrible punishment ensues, the question arises, why so much zeal? For those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't believe, no additional proof will ever be sufficient. This is a dark page ripped from the short life of one exceptional individual. For we the audience, it is cause for deep reflection when choosing between cinematic Art or abiding faith. In any case, this film is a Classic in the most profound sense and one which will surely endure. ****",The Passion of the Christ
63,freemantle_uk,The most anti-Semitic film I have ever seen!,1,7 January 2008,"This is the most anti-Semitic film I have ever seen which in itself makes me rank it one star, but it would earn it anyway.This film tells the story of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life, and it is a gory affair. Whether you are religious or not it is safe to assume that Jesus was an important figure during his lifetime and was a very political person. This film does not show any of this and just show some of the most brutal acts of torture I have seen. I like gritty realism in films, but this goes over the top. As I said if you are going to make a film about Jesus you could do a lot more then just showing him getting tortured.I am not a religious person and I don't know the Bible very well, but when I was at school I was taught that it was the Romans that arrested and killed Jesus, and that the Jews had nothing to do with it. In this film it showed that the Jews arrested Jesus, beat him up and gave him to Romans and demanded that they killed him. I was also taught that Pontius Pilot was the real villain who was very willing to kill Jesus. In the film he is just portrayed as man who had a difficult choice and he did not want to kill Jesus. In the Passion, every single Jew show in it wanted Jesus to be tortured and killed. As a historian I believe that the Romans saw Jesus as a torn in their side and would have been only too willing to kill Jesus.All Jewish characters were made to be stereotyically Jewish, showing the worst parts of it. All the Jewish Priests were made out to be ugly, with large noses and horrible bodies, whilst Jesus and his followers were a good-looking bunch.Mel Gibson also could not help himself and had a bit of Gay-bashing and King Herod as a very camp, very effeminate bisexual who like to dress up as a woman. I admit I don't know much about King Herod or his sexual habits, but I pretty sure that he would not have been camp or just up as a woman at any time of his life, especially in the Middle-east.Finally, as an Englishman I am surprised that Mel Gibson did not portray that the Romans as sadistic Englishman. I have a axe to grind because of Gibson's Anglophonia.The only good thing about this film is that it was done in the languages that was spoken at the time and James Caviezel was a good actor, but I still say avoid this film at all costs.",The Passion of the Christ

This is a movie that depicts suffering of all creations, and a sacrifice a living embodiment of Godhood had endured so we don't have to keep on going suffering (the torment of creation forever).This is a movie different from all other movies, because historic account of Jesus Christ is well known, and respect had to be paid to the story that's been told for the past two millennium. Mel Gibson tried to portray the passion of Christ accurately as he can, and he probably did the best work anyone could have done as present cinematography would permit.Sometimes a movie should be created not purely for entertainment, but to make us think deeper about the core of our existence. Passion was one such movie. It was painful to watch at times, but I respectfully accept that someone actually went through all that for the betterment of all of us.",The Passion of the Christ
65,ianlouisiana,A Colonial Power declines to involve itself in an internal matter.,8,13 April 2007,"If one of the purposes of art is to promote debate and engender controversy then ""The Passion of the Christ is in good company. In 1850 J.E.Millais' ""Christ in the house of his parents"" caused an intellectual scandal for showing the Holy Family as ordinary human beings with the Messiah standing in front of his father's workbench,a stigmata - like wound in his left hand.Even the great Charles Dickens was moved to condemn it.Millais and the other popular Victorian painters were the film directors of their day,each of their new works eagerly anticipated by the public,with queues round the block at the galleries where they were exhibited.The more controversial the work - the longer the queue. ""The Passion"" is a film about foreign occupation of a sovereign state. Pontius Pilate,the Roman Governor,is nominally in charge,but ultimately has neither the will or the means to take effective control. Internecine conflict is rife and Pilate and his men can only make token gestures towards keeping it below the surface. This is all beginning to sound a bit familiar. Pilate considers he and his Legions to be civilised,the native peoples to be little more than animals. Their primitive religious beliefs are of no concern to him,if they want to put a Jew to death then so be it. The way this Jew is treated would in many ways seem to justify Pilate's beliefs. I found ""The Passion of the Christ"" profoundly disturbing in its nihilistic way.Not just for its unswerving depiction of hatred and appalling violence but in the way that it left me with no confidence that human beings had changed for the better in 2000 years. Regardless of whether you believe Jesus Christ was the son of God or merely a deluded religious zealot,the events leading up to his Crucifixion were horrific and inhuman and demeaned the instigators far more than the victim. If Pilate had had a few hundred more soldiers he might have chosen to take a hand in the affair.With incalculable consequences for history.",The Passion of the Christ

It's not a pretty movie, but in all honesty, it's not a pretty story, because we all know how cruelly Jesus was treated; here Mr. Gibson shows us the cruelty. Is the violence merely gratuitous or does it have a legitimate place in the story? It's a judgment call (no pun intended). If you believe the biblical account of Jesus's last hours on earth, then the violence cannot be excluded from the movie. But did the violence have to be so graphically portrayed? Wasn't it enough just to know how Jesus was being tormented without having to actually witness it? Again it's a judgment call. So if you want to watch a movie about the crucifixion of Jesus, this is the movie to watch, but beware: it's graphic, it pulls no punches and offers no apologies if the you leave the theatre upset or perturbed.",The Passion of the Christ

Mel Gibson's ""passionate"" ""The Passion of the Christ"" has to already be the most powerful film of 2004.  From the opening scene in the Garden of Gethsemane until Christ's brutal crucifixion atop Golgotha, ""The Passion"" fixes you in its gravitational pull and never lets you go.  Films like this just cannot be judged in simple terms of ""good"" or ""bad""; ""Passion"" is too far above those categories to be judged so simply and misguidedly.  Not a single word of English is spoken in the ""Passion.""  The whole film is spoken in the original languages of the times - Aramaic, Hebrew, and Latin.  This adds to the authenticity of Gibson's ""Passion.""  No other film is this touching or brutal (save Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988); in my opinion, the only really watchable film about Jesus to date).  This film will make you cringe in your seat, if not jump; I know I did (cringe).  It will frighten you with its stunning amount of realism (Jim Caviezel reacted to his torture scenes with frightening accuracy and pain).  Satan appears to tempt Jesus and is quite frightening too, as with the appearance of many hallucinations of demons by various peoples, namely Judas who betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver.  I would recommend this film to anyone, though I'd certainly tell them to be prepared for a stunning, graphic and above all, realistic depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of our lord and savior, Jesus Christ.",The Passion of the Christ

Unfortunately, I was not able to catch it in its theatrical run. Hey, I am sorry! Do not crucify me for that! At least, I finally saw it on DVD. I must admit that I did commit a major sin by not seeing it as a multiplex experience because it probably would have wowed me even more than it already did when I saw it on DVD. Now, do I really have to get into what the movie is all about? If you do not know that, either your film passion is at a flatline '0' level or you were crawling under a rock with Sadaam for the last 6 months. Anyway, the film focuses on the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life including his torturous crucifixion. Some critics did charge the film as being anti-semitic. I think that is absurd. We have to see the light and be aware of the fact that the film is about the power of Jesus and not so much what violent animosities were bestowed upon him. Director Mel Gibson sure did have a braveheart by taking on this challenging project. His triumphant artistic miracle should resurrect him with a few more Oscar noms after being Academy dormant for a few years. Jim Caviezel should be blessed with a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his defiant work as our lord & savior. 'The Passion of the Christ' has been so far the most talked about film all year!

It is based not so much on the Gospels but on the visionary writings of one Anne Catherine Emmerich, a 19th century stigmatic and mystic, with added flourishes by director Mel Gibson. Non-catholic Christians have described it as almost an advert for Roman Catholicism. I watched it with a Catholic, who pointed out numerous discrepancies from Roman Catholic teaching. Historical inaccuracies appear rife. The over-riding impression is one of unmitigated violence, torture and gore, as we follow the central character's flogging and crucifixion. If it was purported to be fiction, we might simply say it was gratuitously violent (as well as pretentiously subtitled); as a work of art, an interpretation of faith (rather than a statement of the faith itself) it is simply lacking - in style and acting (both of which are often overly theatrical) and impact (though it may have much more impact for the religiously devout rather than the scholarly devout). In terms of social responsibility, this sort of violence seems not only likely to incite revenge hatred but unjustifiable moral highground for religious fanaticism.

(Religious Education). Something that has always struck me is the way young kids don't seem remotely affected when I tell them about Christ's crucifixion. People have become so desensitised - probably by a couple of World Wars, increasingly violent films and video games, shocking images in the news, and franker TV shows - that when they imagine a crucifixion they don't find it particularly unpleasant. The Passion Of The Christ seems to tap into the modern, almost apathetic, attitude towards Jesus's death and jolts us out of our indifference by presenting it on screen in near-repellent detail. Mel Gibson seems to want this film to remind people what they have forgotten. To shock and upset people into realising what an appalling ordeal Jesus endured in his final 12 hours. If you are a Christian and a true believer, you may find the film very profound and affirming. If you are an atheist, you may still find it fascinating for the unsparing historical accuracy with which it shows the terrible realities of mob violence and public punishment in Roman times.The film charts the final 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life. The dialogue is in Latin and Aramaic, painstakingly learned by the actors for the sake of authenticity. As it starts, Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane soon after the Last Supper, but his disciples - supposedly on guard - have fallen to sleep. Caiphas and the high priests come to the garden, guided by Judas, and seize Jesus. He is dragged away and beaten. The next morning, the high priests take Jesus before the Roman governor Pontius Pilate and demand that he be punished for calling himself a King. Unwillingly, Pilate orders that Jesus be severely whipped, which he is, but the high priests are still not satisfied and call for Jesus to be crucified. In despair, Pilate washes his hands of the business and allows Jesus to be taken away to death. Already bruised, beaten and scourged, Jesus is forced to heave his cross to Golgotha Hill, jeered and jabbed and spat upon all the way by the baying crowds. Finally, he is nailed to the cross and left to die, but still screams for the forgiveness of the soldiers and spectators who inflict this unimaginable pain on him.I've never seen suffering depicted so graphically on film. By the end, Jesus's face is swollen beyond recognition and his body is lacerated from head to toe with whip marks. Some viewers have complained that the film is TOO detailed in terms of violence, almost gratuitous and gloating in its depiction of it. Perhaps they've a point. Whether you agree or not, the scenes of Jesus's punishment are certainly more realistic than any ever put on film. There are some scenes featuring Satan - here a snakelike, shaven-headed temptress - which remind us that this is a religious story, but apart from that it plays more like an historical account than a true religious movie. Caviezel as Jesus gives a good performance, though most of the time his role entails squirming on the ground and grimacing in agony. I wish I could show this movie to the kids I teach. Alas, they are way too young (it would probably traumatise them), but it would certainly stop them from having a trivial and apathetic view of what it meant to be crucified. And that, presumably, is exactly the point the film wants to convey.",The Passion of the Christ

The actress that played Mary was great also! She really showed the raw emotion that comes with that role.

Even if you are not a Christian person, there's no doubt that you can still enjoy this movie and appreciate the articulate filmmaking by Mel Gibson. The beating scenes were well done, they were filmed well and the emotion was completely real and raw. I liked how they portrayed Satan here, creepy, evil looking obviously, and menacing looking.

We see Jesus (Jim Caviezel) tempted by the Devil, abandoned by his friends, flogged into near-catatonia, and condemned to death by the bloodlust of a crowd angered at how he has challenged the status quo. To the horror of his mother, Mary (Maia Morgenstern); a former prostitute Jesus saved named Magdalen (Monica Bellucci); and the only male friend out of twelve to stick around when the chips are down, John (Christo Jivkov); Jesus is led to a painful death, a death he goes to willingly for he believes it will open the doors of salvation to all mankind.Gibson and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel find the right angle for every scene, giving a new twist to this well-told story with a POV that's decidedly postmodern, blending Ingmar Bergman (the scenes of the devil especially) with a grittiness and violence right out of ""Saving Private Ryan."" Seeing Jesus suffer so makes it all the more compelling when he stands up and asks for more.That ""Passion Of The Christ"" is controversial goes without saying. ""Entertainment Weekly"" called it the most controversial film ever made, which is saying something when you consider ""Birth Of A Nation"" and ""Triumph Of The Will"" are films, too. That ""Passion"" is as far removed from those celluloid hatefests as possible should go without saying, too; it's a film of conviction and energy that lays responsibility for Christ's death at the feet of a single race, the human race (apologies to Jimmy Cannon). What makes this film so tough for people is the fact that his death is depicted in such a brutal, vivid way that makes it impossible to ignore, which of course is the director's intention.Much of the film's power lies elsewhere, though, like at the opening scene where we see Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane. He's kneeling in the dark, talking to the moon, and apparently not happy with the feedback. It could be all in his mind, including the strange figure standing off to the side with the maggot crawling up its nostril. What we are seeing is an allegory of faith that's timely today, in our world of casual morality and fashionable doubt, echoing the question posed by Roman procurator Pontius Pilate: ""What is truth?"" You don't have to believe in the idea that Jesus himself, as he says, represents ""the way, the truth, and the light"" to get the full-on emotional power of this cinematic narrative. A Don Quixote-like madman would equally warrant our sympathies. Gibson and co-writer Benedict Fitzgerald draw from a variety of sources, Biblical and otherwise, to give the film a ""you-are-there"" verisimilitude like no other Bible epic before it.There's a lot of slow-motion sequences that seem like hammy underlining, and the blood does pour rather heavily, but any film that brings together a performance like that of the ethereal Morgenstern, a musical score like that of John Debney's, and Deschanel's great camera-work is a film worth savoring. The more I see ""Passion,"" the more I find myself saying ""Amen.""",The Passion of the Christ
77,fertilecelluloid,"Bloody and heartfelt, dull and heavy-handed fantasy for morons",5,21 December 2005,"Despite this being about a mythical figure who never existed (a parody of a sun god, in fact), it is bloody and heartfelt. Caleb Deschanel's visuals are gorgeously well toasted, Caviezel's Jesus is sincere, and Gibson's direction is muscular and passionate. So what we have is an elaborate fantasy with strong horror elements.Unfortunately, it's a half hour idea stretched like elastic to four times its justified length. It takes forever to get Caviezel up on that damn cross and his journey there, which is accompanied by brutal whippings and beatings, becomes monotonous after a while.The special effects are realistic, no doubt to convince brainless Believers (of which there are many) that their so-called Savior suffered for us all. If any of it was based on Truth, it'd be even more interersting.",The Passion of the Christ
78,Enchorde,"Above average, not more no less...",6,28 January 2005,"** HERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS **Recap: Well, the last time leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus. It seems to me to be pretty accurate according to my Bible. If you do not know the story, either read the Bible or watch the movie.Comment: OK, now I'm going to focus entirely on the entertainment value. Any other aspect is entirely up to each one of you. That being said, I don't think the story works entirely for a movie, or need to be told a little differently. Some scenes are actually too long and get a little boring. My concentration actually slipped from the story and sought new focus (like chatting to my friends), which I guess is quite contrary to any movies point. For example, when Jesus drags his cross through the streets of Jerusalem. We soon understand how much pain he's in, we know that he is having a hard time (some understatement) and by just repeating this I actually stopped caring and just wished they got were they were going. We knew were they would end up anyway. Because, there is no twists and turns to the story this time, friend. So the story is actually below average, other parts are not however. It is a beautiful shot movie. It seems to be accurate and realistic enough, some scenes painfully realistic (and not for sensitive eyes). Acting is good, and scenery and costumes seem both well thought through, and well worked through. However, for entertainment value, it wasn't enough.6/10",The Passion of the Christ
79,caspian1978,Forget the Subject Matter!,8,6 September 2004,"The plot of the Passion of the Christ can be debated on for hours and hours. But if we were to forget about the movie's plot, we are left with a beautiful and powerful film. Gibson and his team has created the best adaptation of the gospels story on Christ's passion in the past 100 years of cinema. The realism in the image, over powers the audience to think, to accepts and to feel. Whether you believe in it or not, the director has created overwhelming emotion within members of the audience. The first half of the movie alone is priceless. Before we enter the punishment and death of Jesus, we are introduced to a biblical story with characters that are timeless. Even without the second half, the Passion of the Christ is an epic story of faith and destiny. The ""greatest story ever told"" has once again been told by a different story-teller, and yet again, another version of the story is told. On the issue of it being ""anti-Jewish"" and pointing the finger at who or whom is to blame for the event, the Passion of the Christ is far from being a hate film. The overall message, past the blood, the torment, and the powerful images of hurt, anger, ignorance, and pain, the movie's message is one of love.",The Passion of the Christ
80,Jonny_Numb,To Hell and Back,4,12 January 2007,"With The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson wants to hook viewers with the visceral ""drama"" of Christ's last hours on earth, hoping they won't stop to question his methodology. In his film, Jesus and his earthly life is reduced to the stuff of rock-star legacy--he is even trailed by Mother Mary and Mary Magdeline, who bow at his feet like groupies looking to bang the bass player. The revivalist following this film has obtained is a phenomenon more disturbing than any of the lashes dealt Christ (Jim Caviezel) in Pontius Pilate's torture room; Gibson, by tackling a story of faith legend, has turned himself into the type of golden calf Christ would thoroughly condemn.Many years ago, I saw a rendition of the Passion Play at a local church; despite being raised in a ""Christian"" household (with a pastor for a father, even), I have never been too keen on Christ's teachings (Sunday church services were opportunities to doodle in bulletins, not learn life-changing lessons). The play, however, resonated effectively enough to bring me to tears during Jesus' flogging (which took place off-stage, conveyed solely through anguished cries and whip-cracks); by the end, I was uplifted and exhilarated. Great, ""impassioned"" art has that uncanny ability when executed with care.Contrast that to the feeling of revulsion that washed over me when Gibson displayed countless skin-flaying lashes to Christ in the presence of guffawing Roman soldiers and Jewish accusers. The violence itself did not really bother me (the initial lashes hit hardest); yet the scene goes on, and after surviving hits from bamboo, the cat o'nine tails is brought out. Shock gives way to tedium...and eventually, unintentional humor. While Gibson doubtless wants to convey historical accuracy, he should also realize that protracting a scene--no matter how dramatically intensive--can conclude with an apathetic shrug from the viewer.When the scene finally ended, I thought: ""Man, he sure got whipped."" As with Gibson's Apocalypto, the violence, gore, and degradation reaches a level of absurdity and self-indulgence that erodes any dramatic effect, and actually leaves one chuckling at the director's overzealousness.When depicting violence cinematically, character and context is of utmost importance. Anyone who's gone to church on Easter Sunday knows that Christ went through a lot on his way to Calvary; yet Gibson protracts the suffering to an extent that borders on exploitation and sadism--the director cannot get enough shots of the bloodied, beaten Christ falling face-down in the dirt, taking hits from brass knuckles, and being spat at countless times, usually while a spectator laughs hatefully. Ultimately, these images have a potency at first, but the more these actions are repeated, the more their intended effect erodes. Either Gibson is tone-deaf to this knowledge (which, given his anvil-subtle film-making style, is possible), or so full of repressed sadism that he's using a historical base to vent (which is also possible, and nigh distasteful).Insofar as characterization is concerned, we get allusions to Jesus' great deeds in brief flashback--from the Sermon on the Mount to the Last Supper--but this is nothing but a simplistic, spoon-fed Sunday-school lesson, told literally and without insight. As I said before, Jesus is rendered with a rock-star quality: says a few profound things, leaves people in awe, only to be crucified by the masses. Caviezel certainly fits the most popular physical representation of Christ, but is given too few chances to ""act"" outside of absorbing whip-lashings and impalement. Mary and Magdeline are essentially ciphers, following Christ from persecution to death; their dramatic range consists of weeping a lot. Even disciples Peter and Judas are rendered as one-dimensional traitors before disappearing. King Herod's cameo is so flamboyant you wonder why Gibson didn't just cast Alan Cumming for maximum camp value. Of more interest is Pontius Pilate, who oversees the mob's demand of Christ's crucifixion--his protracted moral dilemma is a convincing source of conflict, and made me wonder how a biopic from his viewpoint would have played out. But again, his role is reduced to several truncated scenes.As with Apocalypto, Gibson's sense of villainy is far from subtle, looking to physical ugliness to clarify what 'side' the characters are on: the whip-wielding Romans are stubble-faced, snaggle-toothed ogres; and Barabbas is a leering, one-eyed, snaggle-toothed, tongue-waggling pervert. This visual overstatement seems to convey a lack of trust in the viewer--that it is much easier to ""hate"" these bad hombres with their physical imperfections than it would if they were presented with a common appearance.While Gibson manages to provoke some emotion as Christ hangs on the cross in the last 15 minutes (including a moving exchange between Jesus and one of the criminals), by then it's too little, too late. Martin Scorsese should continue to rest easy knowing his Last Temptation of Christ is a far more thoughtful (and less conventional) telling of Christ's passion...and that Kevin Smith's Dogma remains the finest religious farce ever made. Mel, you should have included a flash of the Buddy Jesus at some point--that bit of humor would have at least been welcome.",The Passion of the Christ
81,valleyjohn,Visually Stunning,9,26 June 2011,"Not to be confused with the film "" The last temptation of Christ"" this film depicts the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus. It is directed by Mel Gibson who is not a man who easily avoids controversy and because of the subject matter of this film , it got more than it's fair share back in 2004 . That maybe because the story of the crucification is quite different to the story we are taught at school. In this adaptation the blame for the crucification , ( apart from Judas) falls squarely on the Jews not the Romans. They don't come out of this very well at all and maybe that is the real reason this upset so many people and that Gibson can barely work in Hollywood any more.For the record , i loved this film. It's visually stunning and not over the top at all as some would make you believe. The dialogue is all in Latin and Aramaic and in no way does that distract from this fantastic movie. ( it is subtitled) James Caviezel is amazing and the scene where he being whipped by The Roman soldiers is breathtaking. Even though i am a devout athiest , i can still appreciate a great film about Jesus Christ and this is that.",The Passion of the Christ
82,truemythmedia,Spiritually Moving,8,11 September 2019,"""The Passion of the Christ"" is a remarkable work of art and from what I understand from the press at the time and since, a spiritual one. The stories of people working on the film and finding something in it that they had never connected with before are numerous and Jim Caviezel's (""The Count of Monte Cristo"") personal stories of his process in portraying Christ lead me to believe that many of these were genuine despite the skeptic in me which wishes to doubt every one of them as simply a well done marketing ploy.One of the reasons I don't doubt them is that I have worked on and made films myself. I think that it is obvious when a producer, director, or writer is coming from a jaded place, focused more on raking in the cash and getting butts in seats than on moving hearts. On top of that, Gibson being a Catholic (albeit a strange one) as well as Caviezel leads me to believe that, unlike their Protestant counterpart filmmakers, the film was seen, in their eyes, as primarily an act of worship rather than and evangelistic endeavor. The reason for doing the film was not to make money (that was the marketing and producers goal once it was made.) It was to show their God how they know and see Him and praise Him for what He did. That alone sets this film apart from the average ""Jesus-film.""
The film itself is incredibly done. Eschewing the typical stained glass and iconic depictions of Biblical events, Mel Gibson (""Braveheart"", ""Apocalypto"") focuses more on the reality of the suffering. He grounds it in the empathy we can't help but feel when we see another human suffering, and takes us on a journey that transcends that physical torture by demanding that we watch that which we would rather turn away from in order to force us to confront the reality. Jesus could have saved himself by just answering Pilate and didn't. He did this willingly. Why?Unfortunately this is where the movie loses some of its punch for me. As much as Gibson focuses on the pain he does let the supernatural creep in periodically. Some of these moments, the devil tempting him in the garden and the torment of Judas, work really well. Others, God's single raindrop tear and Satan crying out from Hell, simply do not and distract from the main themes of the movie because of their visual style which is a departure from the rest of the film's style.Despite these few moments, Gibson's choices visually are remarkably confident. He uses the medium to its full potential by using the edit to cross thematically linked events for the audience and for the characters of John and Mary the Mother of God. Two of the most powerful moments of the film, for me personally, are such moments where Mary sees Jesus as the child he once was and as John recollects the words of the Last Supper as Christ is raised up on the Cross. Both of these moments draw out deep truths that would be otherwise lost. In fact, I'll say now that seeing that moment with John was one thing that kicked off my search for true communion rather than a simply symbolic one.None of this has tarnished with age. In fact, I would say the film has benefited from age. As controversies that surrounded it and seemed to dominate the entertainment news industry when it released fade, the film endures and still moves. It has its excesses such as when the one thief has his eye plucked out by a raven but it certainly deserves its place in the pantheon of great spiritual films mostly because it endeavors to be an experience the audience engages with on a visceral and spiritual level and not just on the level of adrenaline or their wallets.",The Passion of the Christ

84,Spleen,A film whose many flaws cancel each other out and become positive virtues,9,19 March 2004,"I knew I hadn't just bough a cinema ticket when I saw one of the opening ads, in which some second-string Australian celebrities stood in front of the audience to harangue us into reading the New Testament. ""It changed my life,"" each one said in succession. The screen darkened and left me writhing in embarrassment, wondering what kind of naked, bludgeoning propaganda I'd just let myself in for. Would this be like it was sitting through ""Triumph of the Will"", with the addition of the uncomfortable feeling that some of my fellow audience members might actually be taking it seriously, and lapping it all up?Then there was a trailer for an upcoming feature, and I relaxed somewhat.As it happens the film is very much like ""Triumph of the Will""; perhaps closer to pure propaganda. Both films are great, in a curious, disturbing way. One key difference is that Leni Riefenstahl was a great director, performing well below her ability in ""Triumph of the Will""; with ""The Passion"" we have a mediocre director performing above his. Gibson didn't really do a good job, objectively speaking, and by rights his film ought to be dreadful. But Gibson's very failings, each individually enough to sink a film, collectively transform his film into something marvellous. This was a complete fluke; but so what? I've recently seen ""Cold Mountain"", a right shocker of a film even if there was a lot of genuine artistry in its component parts. Why should I be kinder to IT, just because its badness was something of an unfortunate accident? The mirror-image point applies to Gibson's film.The controversy surrounding the film is pointless and silly but not quite too ludicrous to dismiss out of hand. This is NOT an anti-Semitic film; but it's worthwhile looking into why anyone thought it was. An obvious reason would be the scene early on, in which Jesus is captured and brought before the temple  and we see a roomful of jeering, pantomime wicked Jews, not just acting broadly, but acting broadly in unison. The head priest makes some feeble snide comment at Jesus and it's as though everyone else in the room is a puppet controlled by the same set of strings, as they slap their thighs, flail their arms, bend at the waist and contort their faces into unnatural, apelike laughter. This effect is exaggerated by Gibson's two most obvious stylistic devices.Firstly, his ridiculous overuse of slow motion. How slow is this film? I darted out to urinate at one point, halfway through Jesus's progression up Calvary; when I came back, he'd travelled perhaps three metres. Nobody in this film can be whipped, feel remorse, be inspired, crawl in the dust, laugh, cry, walk across the room or pay thirty pieces of silver without it happening  lliiikke  tthhiiisssSecondly, there's the way Gibson uses Aramaic and Latin. You have to applaud his decision to film what is essentially a bilingual story in the correct, original languages. It's obviously the right decision. But this isn't a standard subtitled release. Watch a French film, and you'll see people talking with apparent naturalism in French, with the subtitles doing their best to translate  with, inevitably, the odd word left out here and there, or the odd phrase condensed or simplified or simply unavailable for translation. But because this story was So Very Important, Gibson arranged things so that NOTHING was lost in translation. This means that people speak slowly, simply, emphatically, sparsely, as though they know they're acting for our benefit and want to make sure they say nothing that will be lost in translation or fail to be caught by the slower readers in the audience. This strange mode of speaking is unnerving after a while.The result is, the Jews are like no people on Earth we can recognise. They come across as yet another exotic tribe from the Old Testament, with no obvious connection to anyone living to day; more than that, they aren't even like human beings as we know them. They seem to be aware they're living within the pages of the Bible.But if this is true of the Jews is this is equally true of the Romans. More so, in fact. Gibson's sadistic, buffoonish, verismo-operatic Roman guards whip and mock Christ as though they've been heartened by the pantomime acting the Jewish extras have managed to get away with and wish to do them one better.This is all very irritating at first, but the end result is to heighten the atmosphere and set the ground rules for what is, after all, a grand, dark supernatural fantasy. This is where Gibson's narrowness of vision is actually an asset. The story of Christ's sacrifice ON OUR BEHALF is one of the most ridiculous myths ever told. Tell the full story and it's hard to avoid asking questions like: ""But why didn't God just repeal the eternal damnation he'd condemned us all to, WITHOUT putting himself through this vicarious torture first? He's omnipotent, right? And what possible connection could his decision to allow himself to be whipped have to his decision not to fry you and I for eternity, anyway?"" Gibson vanquishes such awkward questions by simply presenting us the pivotal moment of the Christian myth, in all its gory detail, and letting the rest of the fantasy fall into vague shape by itself.All that remains to object to is the final insert shot of Christ rising from the dead, as though he's about to stalk the land like Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""The Terminator"". But that moment can't erase or negate the strange, seemingly flawed, accidentally magnificent film that precedes it.",The Passion of the Christ
85,EdgarST,"March and ""The Passion of the Christ""",1,20 March 2004,"I saw ""The Passion of the Christ"" one day, and had to go the next to a TV talk show to discuss it. I had a lot of fun, because I was surrounded by a priest, two preachers (the three of them with Bible in hand), a rabbi and a Social Communications professor. I was there as a film critic and scriptwriter. I ended up siding with the rabbi, who was a very nice young man. We even agreed (on camera) that the Bible does not tell everything like it was, that there are other texts telling a different story in some aspects. The others did not challenge our affirmation.According to those texts -which are available everywhere- Pontius Pilate was not such a jerk. He was a ruthless governor, and he crucified many Jewish persons. Moreover, the texts affirm that it was he, not the Jews, who condemned Jesus. According to the rabbi, that also makes a lot of sense: the Romans were the invaders, the dominating force, and to prove it more we all know how the early Christians were persecuted, killed and tortured by the Romans, not the Jews. On the other hand, he said, the gospels were written in very hard times, and the authors most probably self-censored themselves, because it was not safe for their lives to write about the Romans condemning Jesus.Jesus had many, many followers among the Jews. The reason Jesus was captured late at night was because he was inmensely popular, and the authorities were afraid to cause a riot. The mob shouting ""Crucify him! Crucify him!"" belongs more to folk tales; it makes no sense, when one discovers what a charismatic leader Jesus was. The ""washing of hands"" is a Jewish costum, so it's very strange and quite improbable that Pilate was so innocent.I did not like the movie. I think it's quite mediocre. I did not expect much from a homophobic and mysoginistic jerk as Mel Gibson, a man who has specialized in violent films as the ""Mad Max"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" series. That is precisely what he has done, a blood-filled version of the Passion, with a faggoty Herod for comic relief (I am fed up of this stereotype) and a woman playing the Devil (another stereotype from the typical macho mind.)Gibson ommitted everything Jesus said about the world affairs of his time. According to Gibson, Jesus was a sort of hippie who wanted everybody to love each other. That's fine, he did say so, but he was not popular only because of this ""flower child"" philosophy. He was attractive to the masses because he criticized corruption, greed and those who had invaded his land. As the rabbi said, he is much, much more than what Gibson has ""painted"" (with Ketchup), and there was a lot of politics involved in Jesus' Passion.If in ""Braveheart"" -in the typical ego trip of a Hollywood celebrity- Gibson gave himself the role of a hero who was around 24, this time he did not dare to play a 33 year old religious and political leader such as Jesus, a superstar with a clout that has lasted 21 centuries.I find that people say the movie is wonderful based on what they know or read or have been told about Jesus, and not based on what it shows. The movie has a script full of holes (no wonder... Gilbson co-scripted with Benedict Fitzgerald, whose previous credit was adapting ""In Cold Blood"" to television.) For a person who knows little about Jesus' life -and there are many persons who don't know much about it- the scene where he draws a line on the dust and Mary Magdalene extend her hand lying at his feet, says absolutely nothing to that person. It is so poor, simplistic and even dumb in its description of such a rich and passionate figure as Jesus, that this person must wonder during the whole projection what did this guy do to be treated so bad. Because he said love each other and your enemy too? Because Caiphas wanted his head? But why Caiphas wanted his head? Nobody answers these questions. Instead, Gibson relishes every whiplash, every fall. He did not edited anything of that (after the tenth lash or the third fall, one thinks, ""Hey, I got it, man"".) Gibson wanted an effectist movie -with tacky horror elements from grade-Z movies- and he got it.I hope it will win all the Oscars in the world. It deserves them all. The Jesus I admire and whose teachings I respect is quite different from Gibson's bloody concoction and beyond any of man's prizes.",The Passion of the Christ
86,Movie-ManDan,I Must Admit.,7,14 January 2015,"This and The Last Temptation of Christ are two of the most controversial religious/historic movies ever. Last Temptation is a fictional retelling that tries to say Jesus also had problems and understands what we are going through, among others. Passion says less, but has a larger impact on the viewer.Mel Gibson directs an extremely violent depiction of the last twelve hours of Jesus' life, with occasional flashbacks. It has often described as too violent, anti-semitism, torture porn, or ""medieval SAW"" as I have seen on Youtube. I will agree that this is too violent and brutal, but it is accurate nonetheless. Crucifixions back then were as nasty as shown in this. Jesus probably had it a bit worse since blasphemy was the worst thing to do back then. As a two-hour movie, there's about five minutes without any violence and maybe three without any brutality. So this is a very difficult watch. In fact, I remember hearing about somebody that had a heart attack from watching this and some religious people that started going to church more often after seeing this. They say to themselves after watching this, ""God did all that for me?""The movie would have been better if it got more into His resurrection. Over two hours of pure torture with nothing that pays off. In real life it did, but Gibson is a talented director that should have shown some stuff and end on a high note. If that means for a much longer movie, so be it! Last Temptation was almost three hours and that was marvellous.Mel Gibson shows no mercy in showing brutal, excess torture and terror. There is an sexless figure that is supposed to be the devil and scary demons in the shape of little kids that chase Judas. I can see why Gibson would want to include these, but he goes just a bit far. The torture scenes are very explicit that show almost everything. The most shocking and unsettling scene is when Jesus is getting wiped by Pontius Pilate's guards.I didn't like 12 Years A Slave or Unbroken because they repeat the same things with no story and no point. As a Catholic, I can see the reason behind this. Last Temptation showed that Jesus had struggles throughout his life, while Passion shows exactly how terrible the Crucifixion actually was. We all know the story, but this is the most accurate. This is an extremely hard movie to watch, but all pays off by the end.3/4",The Passion of the Christ
87,rosscinema,Gibson's view of the last hours of Jesus,7,27 March 2004,"This film accomplishes what every film should and it has nothing to do with religion (Per say) and it succeeds at creating something that everyone can have a valid opinion on. Story is about the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus (Jim Caviezel) and it starts with him being arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane. Judas (Luca Lionello) has turned him in for a price and he is taken to the Jewish High Priest Caiaphas (Mattia Sbragia). He is charged with blasphemy and then taken to the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate (Hristo Naumov Shopov) who doesn't want him crucified but is worried about civil disorder and the name of Caesar so he reluctantly gives in. The rest of the film shows how Jesus is beaten, whipped, flayed, and finally crucified as the Virgin Mary (Maia Morgenstern) and Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) look on and unable to help.Mel Gibson has directed a film that doesn't chronicle the life of Jesus but focuses on just the last 12 hours and does so with a brutal vision that the squeamish may not be able to handle. You can't help but admire Gibson who put up his own money on a film that can seriously alter his career. There is no doubt in my mind that Gibson is a wonderful director and can direct anything he puts his mind to and I can hardly wait until he does so again. But I do question what will happen to him as an actor. Will audiences buy tickets to see him in an action film or a romantic comedy? Will studios be looking to cast him? I think these are legitimate questions that only time can answer because everyone's perception of him has got to be different now.
Some of the criticism aimed at this film are the inaccuracies from the text such as the Devil lurking about which is not mentioned. But the  main complaints are directed at the violence that is depicted but I think it's definitely what Gibson wanted to do. He wants the audience to understand how much suffering he feels went on and many think that he is rubbing the audiences noses in it. These are all questions that everyone can discuss with each other and it's a tribute to Gibson as a filmmaker that this is taking place. Mel Gibson is a wonderful actor and a terrific director and with this film he proves he's a true artist.",The Passion of the Christ
88,philip_vanderveken,Bloody hell!!!!!,6,26 July 2005,"""The Passion of the Christ"" is one of those movies that will leave no-one untouched. Some will be disgusted by it, others will love it. Fact is that in America religion is still a very hot item and Hollywood is all too glad to contribute to the hype. With all those superstars who chose to out themselves when it comes to their religion (Budhism, Kabalah,... it doesn't matter as they will chose another one next week), it had to happen some day: one of them would make a movie about his faith. Mel Gibson obviously couldn't stand the temptation and had to give us his version of the last hours of Christ.This movie focuses on the last twelve hours of the live of Jesus of Nazareth, better known as Jesus Christ. It all starts in the Garden of Gethsemane, where he is arrested after the betrayal of Judas. At first he is taken to the leaders of the Pharisees, who confront him with accusations of blasphemy. Because they want to condemn him to death, but aren't allowed by their faith, they bring him to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate. He questions Jesus, but doesn't find a reason why to kill the man and tells the Pharisees to bring him to King Herod, who might find a reason. But the king doesn't want to kill Jesus either and he is brought back to Pilatus, who has him tortured and eventually crucified...I've been raised and baptized as a catholic and I only went to catholic schools, so you might expect from me that I'm quite familiar with Catholic faith. But I'm also a European and in opposition to the USA, over here religion has lost most of its power. I don't consider myself as religious anymore - I don't go to church except for a funeral or a wedding - and with me many millions of people. We see the Vatican and the Pope more as a folklorist tradition than as a real religious leader. We just don't need religion anymore and we certainly don't want to spend all our Sundays in a cold building. Do we feel bad about that? No, not at all. If it's true that God is everywhere, then he certainly can't expect that we all come together in one place, he'll find us anyway. So when you know all this about me, you will probably ask yourself why I watched this movie. Well, the main reason is because so many people talked about it. Also the fact that the Jewish community condemned this movie as being racist towards them, made me curious about it. (Not that I understand their way of thinking. It's true, the Pharisees were Jews, but so was Jesus. So how can you possibly say that the Jews were depicted as a terrible people? Next to the traitors, they also had the best victim they could wish for in their own ranks). Anyway, I just got curious about it and the fact that it was directed by Mel Gibson made me hope that it would be a lot better than the average bible movie. If it is better than the average bible movie, I don't really know, but what I do know is that it is a very shocking version of the last hours of Christ. I've seen horror movies that weren't that bloody or cruel in what they visualized. I really wonder if it was necessary to show the torture scene for the full ten minutes or to visualize the crucification in such a graphic way. I believe that most people get the idea of what it was like, even without showing it. No-one feels the need to see it with their own eyes or to experience the pain themselves (except for some weird Philipino's who have themselves crucified year after year of course).But enough about the story. Let's talk about other things now. The directing could have been better in my opinion. I really wonder why they had to use so many slow motions, because even when the movie went on in its normal pace, it was incredibly slow. A couple of times I had the feeling that I wasn't watching a two hour movie but a twelve hour movie. On the other hand I must admit that the acting was OK. The cast has been made up by a lot of unknown actors - I only know James Caviezel - but that didn't bother me and I know why. The fact that they used Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin as the languages in this movie may have been quite unbelievable to many, but made sure that no-one would be annoyed by some awful English accents. And since I'm used to watch movies with subtitles anyway, I didn't mind what kind of language this movie was in. However, if there is one really positive thing that I can say about this movie, than it must be about the music. It reminded me a bit of the music used in ""Gladiator"", and since that is one of my favorite film scores of all time, I really appreciated it a lot. Somehow it sometimes made me forget about all the gore and the slow pace.As a conclusion I want to say that I'm convinced that this movie will be loved by all (fundamentalist and other) Americans, while the Europeans, Asians, Africans,... might have more problems with the extremely religious tone. If you see the ratings, than this only proves that I'm right. The average American gives this movie a 7.8/10. The rest of the world gives it a 7/10. Personally I think a 6/10 is more than enough, because it certainly doesn't make me want to dig up my bible from underneath that gigantic pile of books under which it has been hiding for years, so I can start reading it again. After seeing this movie I've had it with religion for many years to come.",The Passion of the Christ
89,Luigi Di Pilla,The masterpiece is done,9,18 September 2004,"I have just watched it on DVD. Mel Gibson created an authentic proof of Jesus' last steps. The story is well packed in two hours and tells you the most important things what son of god said. For example: ""I have the power to die and to get my life back."" The setting, design and the picture was superb. There were some hard scenes not for anybody. You need here very strong nerves because there is much blood and violence. Anyway for everyone a must see. I liked very much the soundtrack and it is well adapted to each part of this biblical masterpiece. All my expectations were fulfilled and I wish that it will earn many Oscars because it really deserves. Especially for Mel Gibson and Jim Caviezel. Jim represented Jesus so real that you could think yes that was Christ. I cannot explain myself why this film get so many negative critics concerning the violence. I think that Mel Gibson wanted only to show the audience what really happened at this time. I will add the DVD in my best of collection. My rating: 9/10.",The Passion of the Christ

As a film cannot contain the whole of a book, neither can it encompass all of the scholastic research on the crucification or birth of Jesus (there will be errors and omissions), however it can do what movies do so well - it can move us into the perspective of those who were part of that event. Both of these movies do this for me. Both have stellar casts who give us great performances. The cinematography is profound, the scores are beautiful. The choice of locations tell their own stories well. For all of those reasons, I give these films 10 (splendid) out of 10. {Historical Drama}",The Passion of the Christ

And even less, of course, he could have carried the heavy cross that far. Unless, of course, it is because of his divine powers. Everything has to be fulfilled. He must stand the maximum of physical and psychic suffering to understand all aspects of being  a human.One might say that the sadistic drunken Romans are overacting and in one way that's true. But in this concept, in the concept the movie is done, you are not really disturbed. It's a certain rhythm here and the Satan figure fits in.There have been things said about antisemitism. Well, if you are supposed to make a ""true"" film about the Gospel, you can't leave the Jews out as they appeared in that Gospel.

If you're gonna bash Jesus, you might as well bash him right.Okay, send me your hate mail and get it over with. But Mel, not me, does more bashing of your effeminate savior than every other Jesus movie in the last two-thousand years combined.That's all that PASSION OF THE Christ is. The maiming, whipping, crucifying and killing of one Jesus H. Christ, Super Jew. The ultimate Christian snuff film. People blame juvenile violence on video games, heavy metal music, any number of asinine inanities, yet here those same people are beating off to the beating, surging for the scourging, forcing this filth down their children's necks - then wondering in blank ""who-me?"" innocence why their kids are so violent.Mel Gibson, a great filmmaker, has taken this most famous of Christian fairy tales and made HALF a movie. Because he knows the whole Earth is inculcated with the bloody tale, he provides not a whit of backstory, motivation, or plot, expecting us all to bow in supplication before this B-movie made on an A-budget. Just one example of bad movie-making: We see Disciple Peter (we don't know it is him at the time), with a woman at his feet, draw a line in the sand and people drop stones to the dusty earth. Anyone unfamiliar with their fractured fairy tales is lost.

94,BrandtSponseller,"Doesn't succeed as an artwork, but there are some assets",6,11 March 2005,"The film covers the final days of Jesus (James Caviezel), based on the Christian Bible. It begins with one of Jesus' followers, Judas, leading ideological/political opponents to Jesus so they can arrest him, and covers his trial and the carrying out of his sentence(s).This is not an easy film to review, as it is so difficult to divorce it from the broader cultural and belief issues, as I feel we must. A film, as an artwork, isn't better or worse because of your personal beliefs in its veracity or even its cultural importance. A large part of what I do as a critic is to try to review films as artworks apart from those extra-filmic kinds of considerations. This leads me to say that I think something like Citizen Kane (1941) is not a very good film, whereas something like Catwoman (2004) is. I'm not denying that Citizen Kane is historically important or that a lot of people love it, think it ""rings true"" and think it is one of the greatest films ever made. I'm likewise not denying that a lot of people hate Catwoman and think it is ""unrealistic"". When it comes to whether I believe that they're good films or not, those issues just do not matter.I should tell you that I do not believe in the ""truth"" of any religion, and I haven't ever been socialized into any religious beliefs. I have little knowledge of the minutiae of specific religious texts, including the Bible. I have some interest in the philosophical and other broad theoretical and cultural/social issues involving and surrounding religions, but none of those are relevant to me when it comes to saying whether The Passion of the Christ is good as an artwork. I don't think this is a particularly good film. It does have merits, but it's loaded with problems.The chief problem is that writer/director Mel Gibson thinks that exposition isn't important. He's probably assuming that almost everyone watching will not need to be told who characters are or why they're doing what they're doing. I'm not very familiar with the source material--I haven't read the book the film is based on, although I've browsed through it. I don't think that films should require prerequisites, with the sole exception of some entries in a series.For the mob(s) depicted to be reacting so strongly against Jesus, there must be some interesting events in his past and some interesting psychological and sociological phenomena occurring. We can tell there's an intriguing story somewhere, but Gibson instead spends far too much time on very narrow events that do not have the impact they should have when they're out of the broader context. Yes I know that ""The Passion"" refers to a specific sequence of events in the protagonist's life, but that doesn't make this succeed as an artwork. I'm not going to give extra points for getting the name of the film ""right"". Gibson could do a film called The Breakfast of Mr. Jones, and if it's just 90 minutes of a guy eating pancakes, it might be a bad film.Other than the mob mentality, most of the other main characters, including Jesus, are portrayed as if they have a degree of mental illness. That's also intriguing but not explored. Judas has hallucinations and hangs himself. Jesus can't or won't talk and when he does, he mostly says cryptic things. He shows little awareness of his predicament. We need to be shown more about these characters for this to make sense or have impact.In addition to being cryptic, a lot of the dialogue is hokey. The best dialogue, and the best material in the film in general involved the Romans. They were the only ones shown with a degree of psychological depth. Their difficult situation as overseers of an outpost in their empire created ethical quagmires for them, one of which is the gist of the film. They're appropriately shown having a range of dynamic reactions to their treatment of their prisoner, from sympathy and regret to murderous, mob-mentality abuse.That treatment comprises a huge percentage of the film. A lengthy section consists of Jesus being whipped until he's almost dead. A larger section consists of him walking through town carrying a heavy wooden cross. While the whipping mostly works, the latter section is far too drawn out, with Gibson repeating material such as Jesus collapsing five or six times. It's effective once or twice. Five or six times feels like padding. Maybe that's what the Bible says happened, but we can't forget that this is a film, and has to work as such.Another problem is the music. While some of it is attractive, it's because it is so close to Peter Gabriel's score for The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) that Gabriel could probably successfully sue for copyright infringement. Influence is fine, but plagiarism is something I don't condone.However, the cinematography throughout the film is fantastic. DP Caleb Deschanel deserves kudos. A number of scenes/shots stand out visually, one of the best being after Jesus is whipped and his intensely red blood stains the gray-white square. Another is when Jesus is about to be arrested, and bright yellow-orange flames stand out against a washed-out, dark, blue-gray texture.The visceral nature of the film is excellent. This would be a dream come true for someone with a torture fetish. The graphic material is handled extremely realistically--it's difficult to discern any prosthetics or special effects make-up. It really looks like they just beat the hell out of Caviezel. Horror special effects/make-up artists should study the film and the techniques used.And of course, as I mentioned earlier, there is promise to the story. A good film could certainly be made using this material. It's just not this one. If you have strong beliefs in Christianity you might find the film an extremely moving experience, but that doesn't describe me.",The Passion of the Christ
95,lambiepie-2,You are there.,10,25 February 2004,"This is a very moving film.I would say, you don't HAVE to be religious to appreciate it -- if you are a film student, there's enough to keep you busy and astonished. All of the ""blame"" hype was lost on me the minute after I saw the film. In my view, all this was uncalled for.It has been a few years since the traditional sense of ""Hollywood"" got to make a film about Jesus, and this film is about his last 12 hours. The easiest way to explain it is to say--when you LOOK at this movie, there is no doubt Mel Gibson's vision is to put YOU there. Once you are there, once you are a witness to this, then it's up to you to decide how you wish to describe it, take it, feel it. And you will do all of those things. That is movie making folks.It is violent. Very, very violent. But remember, this is NOT violence for violence sake, it is as it was and now, YOU are there. YOU have a visual and you deal with it as you can.Let me say this about the taking of ""children"" to this film. (And by Children I mean 8 and over. Under 8, don't think about taking them.)Personally (and again, this is just MY view), I am sick and tired of children being used as a shield. Here's how you decide: If you are sending your child to a religious service of any kind, you should not be afraid to take your child. In my view, they should have an idea what they are reading and talking about while in religious service. This film is not ""playtime"". It is, as it was. Will the child have questions? You bet. Will the child be confused of the images? You bet. But if you are so religious to consistantly send your child to a religious service, then be as so bold to let them view this.If you are a parent of a child who doesn't have a big religious background or teaching, then its up to you. View it first, then decide for your child. DVD is a good option. If it's the ""violence"" that gets ya -- then maybe we all need to think about ""the violence"" that was inflicted upon Jesus and wonder, so why DO we sit in churches, etc. if we wish to run from this.Yeah, I got this and more from this film. I DON'T blame a specific group. People are as they were. I understand that now. I'm just amazed at this project and the wonder of it getting through the current Hollywood System as it is.

96,PatrynXX,Good movie. But doesn't show anything to make it stand out.,7,1 September 2004,"(spoilers? o_O)Haven't read the bible yet huh?I'd consider myself a Christian.  Not a strong one by any means, but just your average Christian that believes in Jesus.Associating Jesus with one of the most violent movies on the market today probably shouldn't be in the same sentence.  If your obsession is with S&M by all means.  But the overuse of blood and violence as it was done was totally w/o merit.  Now as far as violence goes.  This isn't truely that bad.  But the movie spans 12 hours and since a good chunk is wasted by these silly slow motion techniques it's lost on me.I still go by the rule of whatever works to convert someone to Christianity....  but I wouldn't go anywhere near this film if I was depressed.Go check out 1977's Jesus of Nazereth.  Much better by far.  Sure it's 6 hours long, but it's not a 2 hour mentally insane movie.  If you really need a nice feast.  Check out Jesus Christ Superstar.  Now that movie makes Jesus out to be really kewl :)I guess it's a sad way of going...  to our society it takes a violent movie to turn heads.  Well not mine.  10 years from now, maybe 30..

97,baumer,"Religious, atheist, agnostic, it doesn't matter",10,26 April 2007,"The Passion of the Christ is an undeniably moving and emotionally galvanizing experience and will indelibly stay in your conscience long after the credits roll. It is now 3 years later, and I saw the film once in the theaters, and I remember it like I saw it yesterday. And this is coming from someone who still hasn't made up his mind about religion. This is a one of a kind film that will affect you as long as you have a pulse. For those jaded enough to just view the film as anti-Semitic or just plain hooey, then perhaps I will stipulate that you will find something wrong with it. But for anyone who at least has a humanitarian side to them, this movie will get inside you and never leave.Mel Gibson has lost much of his credibility when he got drunk one night and went off on Jews. This rant painted him as a hypocrite and that is very unfortunate because this film is one that at least has something to say. If nothing else, it shows us that humanity hasn't changed in 2000 years. We are still as violent as we ever were. We still don't value a human life anymore than we did when Jesus ostensibly walked the Earth. Christ apparently died for our sins and if you believe in this, if you accept the fact that Jesus got tortured more than any living thing should be, then you have to understand that this was done so that we could have our sins wiped away when entering the Kingdom. But it was also done, if you believe in Christianity and/or Catholicism, so that we could become better people. Why else would God allow his only begotten son to succumb to such despicable and inhumane treatment? One would hope that it is to better humanity, not make it worse. Although I didn't live in Biblical times, I can only assume that times are not any better now than it was then. Torture is still prevalent in myriad of countries, and even condoned by the U.S president himself...the most powerful man in the world. Famine is at an all time high and while the rich countries like the one I live in do little to help wipe it out, there are starving people even on our street corners. Altruism is a word that most people don't know how to spell let alone practice. Greed is everywhere and the opulence that is provided by the very Earth we live on is being destroyed and pillaged by those that should be thanking their lucky stars that we have this great place to live in.What does this all mean? Does this have anything to do with the movie? Of course it does. As I said, if anything this film appeals to the humanitarian in all of us. I don't know how I feel about God, Jesus, John 3:16 and The Bible and so on. But even though I am ambivalent to all of this, I still have emotions and I do respect a human life. And if a man, deity or human, was actually treated this way by a society that existed 2000 years ago or 10 days ago, it is bothersome. If there was a man named Jesus Christ that existed and taught us to be altruistic and benevolent and peaceful, he would be disgusted to see how we all turned out. The Passion of the Christ is about that man. It doesn't matter if he was a God, a spirit or the flesh and blood, this is a film about the power belief. But it is also about the power of corruption and corruption of power. And power can be absolutely corrupting and this is what has turned our world into a cesspool of the rich and dangerous. Because when you watch the film, the fear of this man, the fear of what he represented is what scared everyone.The Passion of the Christ is a masterpiece of film making. I believe it wasn't nominated for anything because the donkeys that run Hollywood are powerfully corrupt as well and there are plenty of powerful figures who just don't agree with the supposed message and supposed anti-semitism. I don't really think Mel cares too much what the rest of Hollywood thinks of him as this film apparently netted him more than 300 million dollars as he funded the film by himself. I say good for him. It's a shame alcohol makes you say such asinine things because Mel damaged his reputation beyond repair when he did so, but that shouldn't take away from the brilliance of this film. James Caviezel is a miracle as the Christ figure. Speaking in an entirely different language he conveys the passion, the fear, the emotion and the spirit of Jesus Christ. I can't imagine another actor playing this part.The Passion of the Christ is one of the most moving motion pictures of all time. It brought me to tears. Tears of anger, tears of sorrow and tears for fear. As I said, this is coming from someone who sits on the fence when it comes to religion. If you are a Christian or a practicing Catholic, this film will move you like no other.10/10 Love it or hate it for what it says, you cannot deny how it will make you feel.",The Passion of the Christ
98,mstomaso,Great visually stunning period piece,9,5 September 2005,"This film is neither preachy nor pedantic, and was a welcome surprise for me. As a non-Christian who nevertheless respects the historical figure of Jesus Christ and the beauty of his philosophy and teachings, I found The Passion to be a powerful portrayal of much that I think is worthwhile about the Christ story. I know the film has been maligned for anti-semitic content (perhaps because Jews make mistakes in the film and are seen as persecutors instead of victims? - it could have been anybody!), and for various other problems - but let's face it - any movie portraying this subject was bound to face strong reactions. And kudos to Mel Gibson for not shying away from the subject by creating a sterile, gutless, Disney story out of what really was a good example of the everyday horror of life on the fringes of the Roman empire. Gibson invents a new genre with The Passion - that of historical horror. The performances in this film are inspired. I felt that the film brought out the cowardice of the apostles very forcefully, and the courage and love of the two Maries in Jesus' life was palpable to the very end. The effect of Aramaic and Latin, with the moody soundtrack, was spellbinding. Again kudos to Mel Gibson for his courage and artistic integrity on the decisions involved in these elements of the film.Final word - this is not a film for the whole family nor is it a feel-good film. Don't see it if you're not willing to confront the worst aspects of human nature up close. And don't go in looking for your own version of the story - it's not your film! This is what Mr. Gibson believes, and it's his own revelation, not necessarily to be shared by all.",The Passion of the Christ
99,film-critic,Why is this night different from every other night?,7,6 April 2005,"To start us out on the right foot, I thought that it was good, but definitely not great. Mel Gibson is a powerful director that proves that he can handle big epics like Braveheart or very emotional stories like Passion of the Christ. His creative eye and ability to transform a simple story into a very real and seismic journey is impressive. There are not many directors that I feel could handle these two challenges together. Gibson has proved that he could twice. Throughout this film, I was constantly impressed with the visual images that were presented before me. Every time Jesus was hurt, I could feel the pain just oozing from the television. The ability that Gibson has to bring us these hauntingly beautiful images and also control his actors into becoming their characters left my jaw on the ground. He is a genuine director that was able to bring his personal passion to the screen with bold emotions and a powerful eye.As mentioned before, I felt that Gibson did a fantastic job and should have been recognized by the Academy for his ability in Passion, but the overall film seemed lacking. There I was, sitting on my couch deeply getting involved with the film, when suddenly it is over. The last twenty minutes of this film just seemed like they were rush edited together. I realize that it is only supposed to be an account of the final twelve hours of Christ, but I needed something sturdier to wrap the film up. There just seemed to be so many loose ends. Perhaps it had something to do with the random and chaotic flashback sequences that both aided and hurt the overall tone of the story. The flashbacks were helpful in identifying the ""when"" and ""who"" of the story, but never really hit upon the ""why"". Some flashbacks helped progress the story, while others just left me with a puzzled look on my face. This was a negative aspect of the film. I think the writers of this film should have just allowed the story to progress from the beginning. Not necessarily taking up hours in building these moments, but a quick recap at the beginning would have helped the less religious person in me. I just felt the ending and these brief snippets were distracting and not as informational as I wanted them to be (which is why they were there in the first place).Aside from that, the rest of this film was a sheer enjoyment to watch. To see this man suffer for our sins was impressive and an act that you would not see today. The actors in this film exceptionally portrayed the characters. James Caviezel's emotion is unmatched in the film industry, while the nearly wordless actions of Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci added so much more to the story. To see their eyes along could bring tears to any strong person. The portrayal of Satan (or evil) was also impressive. I didn't quite know how Gibson was going to incorporate this, but the method that he used provided this real image of evil instead of a ""cartoonish"" or ""CGI monster"" creation. It kept the story balanced and provided some controversial themes for Christ as he carried the cross. The reality of this film is what also impressed me. Sometimes with adaptations you get these random tangents that feel like the director was just looking to pull more people into the theaters, but not with Passion. Gibson's choice to use the language at the time was absurdly perfect. I would have preferred to see this film without the subtitles, because it would have built a stronger emotion behind the events as they took place. Since he did not do that, the choice to have it subtitled with still the original voice again kept this film grounded.True, this was a story about Jesus, but to me what was harder to watch was the violence that man has inside of him. Here we have a truthful story showing man destroying man. That to me is more frightening than all the blood on Jesus. To watch another person do what they did to this person was simply horrific. While others will argue that this never happened, I say to them, pick up a newspaper and read the headlines. The actions that we do to our fellow man are just as bad as what these Romans did to Jesus. While we may not see all the blood, our consistent lack of respect and rising murder rate prove that we care nothing for our neighbor. This had me thinking that perhaps Gibson's true message had something to do with the status of our world today  hum  something to think about! Overall, I thought this was a good movie, just not the greatest I have seen. Perhaps the excitement and publicity (good and bad) surrounding this film built it up too much, but I have seen better. Sadly, I think the religious people in the world that speak negatively about this film need to realize that it was just a film. There are worse movies being released today that perhaps they should be focusing their attention onto. Gibson should have been nominated for an award for this film just because of the power that he created. I also think that Caviezel and Morgenstern should have been rewarded for their work. I have seen emotional films, but these two actors brought more to the table than I have seen in any other film. It impressed me, and it should have impressed the Academy. While I think everyone should see this film once, I do not believe it is one that should be continually recognized as one of the greats. Gibson could have had the best film of the year, but loose ends and fragmented flashbacks caused this film to stay at average.Grade: *** out of *****",The Passion of the Christ
100,ElijahCSkuggs,Intense and inspiring...,10,2 April 2004,"The Passion of the Christ is Mel Gibson's masterpiece and surpasses his Oscar winning Braveheart by leaps and bounds.  Being Catholic, I went into this movie expecting to be moved, and the overall feeling as I left the theater is beyond comprehension.  Before it's initial release to the world, I watched many a show that dealt with the notion that perhaps this film would cause an uprising towards the Jewish faith and its people.  Yet once having viewed the movie, I can say that the media and the press had once again blown something totally out of proportion;in fact, creating a hysteria that was remarkably needless.  This film is NOT in any way, shape or form antisemitic, and though my anger rose to dizzying heights during the film and Jesus' relentless beatings, I merely laid it to rest due to the fact that this happened quite some time ago.  Yes I wanted all of the Roman guards to die and yes I wanted the high priests to die, but all in all, this story is based on real events and they don't.  The good guy dies.  The films violence which has practically scared every infantile critic to tears, is nowhere as gruesome as people have claimed it to be.  Not saying the film isn't violent, but the amount that the film does contain is absolutely necessary to get Gibsons point and the suffering of Jesus for our sins completely across.  One thing that I'm afraid won't happen, is that this movie will not win any Oscars.  The overall feel of the movie is authentic, and what truly makes a great movie?, realism.  Schindler's List had it, Saving Private Ryan had it, and The Passion of the Christ has it and alot to spare.  The movie is damn close to perfect epic cinema, and everyone involved should be supremely proud of their efforts.  Especially Jim Caviezal who quite honestly played the most physically daunting and draining role one could imagine.  Films just don't give feeling like this enough.",The Passion of the Christ

When I went to see THE PASSION, I was also full of doubts and controversial feelings. However, after watching this film I must admit that I had been highly mistaken. It is one of the best and most mystical films about Christ's passion ever made, based on the New Testament and enriched by the visions of a German visionary, Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774-1824), the author of the book THE PASSION. Mel Gibson did a wonderful job showing Christ as He really is - the man and God at the same time. In this way, a person that sees this film will ask oneself a fundamental question: Who is the Christ for me? What does He really mean in my life? When I was in the cinema, I witnessed people crying out loud. It was extraordinary since it proves that the movie really addresses human hearts.The cast are not as famous as in other films (except for some, like Monica Bellucci). Nevetheless, they all play really well. I particularly liked Jim, who felt his role deeply in his heart, a role that has had an everlasting impact on my vision of Jesus; Maia Morgenstern, who was an excellent choice for Madonna expressing a profound spiritual link with Her Son; Rosalinda Celentano, who portrayed Satan as no one has ever done before; and Mattia Sbragia as the furious high priest Caiaphas. ""Are you the Messiah?!!""... What a performance! That's the most powerful of all portrayals of the high priest.The archaic language, Latin, and still spoken Hebrew and Aramaic are another aspect that raise the value of the film. Isn't that a lovely return to the very roots of Christianity! EXCELLENT! All in all, Mel Gibson's film IS a great inspiration for people to come back to Christ, to reflect on Him more, to realize that there is always a hope that the glory of the third morning teaches...I AM MOST GRATEFUL TO MEL BECAUSE THANKS TO THIS MOVIE, HE HAS REMINDED ME OF CHRIST'S LOVE IN THE NEW MILENIUM, THREATENED BY HATRED AND TERRORISM! 10/10! This film is really for everyone - old, young, believer or atheist - as a matter of fact, He died for all of us!",The Passion of the Christ
102,gftbiloxi,Occasionally Brilliant But More Often Problematic,3,1 April 2005,"Christ prays in Gethsemane. He is confronted by Satan, who takes the form of a man-woman. A serpent slithers from Satan toward him; Christ crushes it with his foot. Thus begins Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion of the Christ, a film that has sharply divided both Christians and cinema critics.At moments this is a fine film, indeed an occasionally brilliant one. The cast is excellent; the use of Latin and Aramaic is remarkable; the cinematography exceptional; the production values are first rate. But The Passion is also an extremely inconsistent film that repeatedly undercuts itself through Hollywood flourishes and excessive fiddling with the Gospels on which it is based.In truth, the film says less about the Gospels than it does about the way in which director Gibson reads them. The film is extremely homophobic, first presenting Satan as a multi-sexual entity and then depicting Herod and his entire court as a host of screaming drag queens. The film is also, in my opinion, extremely anti-Semitic--but in a way that many will find hard to pinpoint, for it achieves that tone through the way it is cast and the way various characters are played off each other.What the film isn't is greatly spiritual: with copious amounts of blood, it is more about the hell inflicted on the body than it is about the soul that transcends the torment. And it is here, really, that Gibson most vividly overplays his hand. After a certain point the violence becomes unbelievable, and I found myself wondering more about the special effects than I was actually caught up in the movie.If you've never bothered to learn exactly what sort of horror a crucifixion was, The Passion will certainly enlighten you--and at times it may even move you to tears. But ideally you should read all four Gospels and do a survey of Roman Catholic tradition re the passion before you walk in the door. That way you'll know the difference between text, tradition, and Gibson's inventions. Three stars for an excellent cast, production values, and being generally thought-provoking.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",The Passion of the Christ
103,CitizenCaine,Gibson's Passion Apparent,9,29 June 2004,"One of the two most controversial movies of the year, along with Fahrenheit 9/11, Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ is a provocative film about the final hours of Jesus Christ. The film contains a multitude of foreign languages, including Aramaic and Latin, making subtitles necessary throughout. Gibson was planning on releasing it without any subtitles, which would have been an even bolder move yet. Funded by Gibson himself and made with painstaking effort, the film has generated a lot of controversy about its purported depiction of anti-Semitism, its changes to accepted versions, its violence, and its message. The film differs from most all other films about Christ; in that, it only focuses on the final hours of His life. Other films usually attempt to portray His life and ministry as depicted in the New Testament renderings. Gibson's focus then is the mistreatment that Christ suffered from the point at where He was betrayed by Judas Iscariot onward. The film opens in the garden of Gethsemane where Christ tries to see if God will help Him avoid what He knows is about to come. Enter Satan, one of the controversial elements of the film, who appears several times throughout the film. Rosalinda Celentano plays an androgynous Satan, who perhaps symbolically represents Christ's inner struggle with accepting His fate. Surely this must have been present in some form, as He was human also. James Caviezel, as Christ, is well cast; in that, he lacks the star power to distract the audience from the story like a big name star would. Caviezel plays Christ as just another man, who endures unspeakable acts and victimization beyond what any of us would expect anyone else to do. The actual physicality of what occurs, minus any religious significance, is enough for some of us to ponder our own inhumanity, but the added religious significance for some viewers will be overwhelming and awe inspiring. The story pretty much follows a synthesized version of the gospels. It's the insertion of certain non-gospel elements that provide the controversies. The complaints of anti-Semitism are understood, although possibly misdirected. Perhaps the upsetting elements in this respect are the seemingly one dimensional portrayals of Jewish leaders, while simultaneously making Pilate a more conflicted, sympathetic character than is usually accepted. Pilate, as portrayed by Hristo Naumov Shopov, is probably the most interesting character in the film due to this surprise, however controversial. Maia Morgenstern is Mary, Jesus' mother, and the enchanting Monica Bellucci is Mary Magdalene. Their looks of anguish and sadness are not easily forgotten. In fact, each of them has one scene in particular that really shines. The scene where Christ protects Mary Magadalene from stoning is superb, and the look that Mary has on her face, as she faces the camera (and in effect us in the audience) as it pulls away from her after Christ's removal from the cross, is one of profound sadness. She almost seems to question us silently; what have we done? It is sure to touch the hearts of many viewers. The focal point of the last hours is the scourging and carrying of the cross. The Jewish leaders and Roman centurions are too one dimensional at times that they almost become caricatures. Some people may think that the scenes are laborious and too violent; indeed the whipping and mocking seem interminable. It is still incredible that, in this age of desensitization, these scenes still have the power to awe us. If you're religious, they may affect you deeply; if you are not religious, they still serve to demonstrate the heroic fortitude that a man had to live out what He thought His destiny was. The film concludes with a very brief reference to the resurrection, which will disappoint some viewers. For all his obstacles, Mel Gibson deserves kudos for bringing this heartfelt, most accessible version to the screen, providing the screenplay with Benedict Fitzgerald and directing it. There are several continuity errors with Caviezel's wounds and editing involving these scenes, but the costumes, make-up (especially Caviezel's wounds), and sets are first rate. Caleb Deschanel's cinematography evokes Medieval paintings, and John Debney's musical score is Middle East-flavored, powerful, rousing, and triumphant. Stripped of overt Hollywood or CGI miracles, except for metaphoric or symbolic effect, the film becomes more accessible than any previous version that has been made about this topic for a wide audience. Reportedly the cast went through a number of hardships to make the film, including Caviezel's dislocated shoulder (which is in the film), and his being struck by lightning. This film is a grand achievement. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",The Passion of the Christ

105,jon.h.ochiai,Gibson's Passion and Spirit,10,29 March 2004,"Director Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a powerful and moving motion picture that is brutal to endure, and at the same time it is one of the most mesmerizing movies ever made. One must truly applaud Gibson for making the movie he wanted to make. Based on the play, ""The Passion of the Christ"", Gibson along with co-screenwriter, Benedict Fitzgerald apparently researched the Books of the Apostles among other sources. Gibson's choice for using Aramaic dialogue works. Much of ""The Passion""'s power comes from this reverence for authenticity. After the first 10 minutes, the movie almost becomes an exercise in brutality-- when Jesus is arrested for heresy. The profound difference is that these acts of brutality against Jesus are in context. In a strange way, this works, because we know how it ends. Through a very powerful and compassionate performance by Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ, we experience almost viscerally the courage, faith, and love Christ must have to bear the sins of Man. Gibson is a master storyteller, particularly in his use of flashbacks. Whether he is illustrating the betrayal of Christ by Judas, Peter renouncing Him three times, or a more peaceful time with Jesus showing his mother Mary a table he built, everything is complete. Maia Morgenstern as Mother Mary is gives a truly amazing performance. She is so strong and pure of heart. Her relationship with Jesus is touching and so very powerful. In a very heart-wrenching and moving scene in the movie, Mary rushes to Jesus as he falls carrying the cross, at the same time she flashes back to Jesus falling down as a child. Gibson's introduction of Satan, and the character played by a woman (Rosalinda Celentano) is effective. Satan as the voice of doubt rather than evil in this context lends an effective human touch. Much has been made of the apparent anti-Semitic tone of ""The Passion"". If this is so, it is not that apparent. Once again context, not content is everything. In the story, the Pharisees set the murderer Barabas free, in exchange for Jesus, whose only apparent crime is that of heresy-- he says that he is the Son of Man. The politically minded Pontias Pilate (a good Hristo Shopov) agrees to crucify Jesus, and washes his hand of the matter. What matters most here is not so much what happened, rather what is the validated point of view. Bottomline: This is a movie that has a storied history with many interpretations, and perhaps a point of view which is the nature of the art form. The chastising and crucifixion are described in excruciating detail which is a way to go with this movie, and again this in context. Gibson is unflinching in his commitment to authenticity. This creates an arc, that Christ endured the burden of the Sins of Man. So there is great power when the crucified Christ says ""Forgive them, Father. They know not what they do."" Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of Christ"" may be the best movie of the year-- this is truly a powerful and moving film. Gibson is a courageous and masterful storyteller, and he generated some very powerful performances from a talented cast, particularly with Caviezal and Morgenstern.",The Passion of the Christ

It is a biblical fact that the ""establishment"" did not like the sayings of Jesus so it was in their interest to be rid of him; cannot see what the fuss is about on that score as the movie is even handed. Some would say that one of the tenets of Christian philosophy is about suffering and forgiveness and my reading of the film is that it is illustrative of those principles. The movie in my view is wholly convincing, enormously passionate and powerful, and thought provoking; 10 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
109,Angry_Arguer,Replacement Emotions,10,25 February 2004,"This is your only spoiler warning...Ho-boy does Mel Gibson owe us a big apology for the mindless mess that was 'Braveheart'.Our fears have been alleviated and confirmed.  Here is Mel making film for the sole purpose of expression.  He wants to be Malick, he even gets Caviezel to play God.  Not aiming for any financial gain will certainly make him popular among the art circles.  Mel also wants be the next Ollie Stone because he sticks to his beliefs despite outside influence.  Here Mel really shows guts.What an ironic triangle we have here.  We advance from the Italian Zefirelli, the man who decimated Shakespeare, to Scorsese's Italian roots to Mel's outrageously Italian-influenced adaptation of the same thing.  Three men talking about the same thing in different languages with different Italian influences.  Hmm...there's an interesting look.  Unfortunately, none have the imagination of the Renaissance.  Did Mel learn something after working on Franco's 'Hamlet'?Some problems: Mel is still bound to the Sunday school imagery that hurt Scorsese.  Rather than elaborate, he is stuck in his fantasy land where evil is hairless.  That force of evil is the real narrator despite all the flashbacks.  Meanwhile, Mel uses some simple symbolism and gets Gethsemane and Eden twisted together.  Mel's technical field relies on his 'Braveheart'-related techniques.  His slow-motion is choppy and uncoordinated, blown out of proportion like Michael Bay.  Sadly, he reuses some many staples in the genre.  We've seen the same crowd scenes, crucifixion, garden, and even resurrection before.  Only the sadism is different.There are films that tell you how to think and there are films that let you feel for yourself.  Mel is a pro at telling us how to think because half his power rests in the music.  Horner was good at that up until 'Titanic', Zimmer is equally effective.  None of that skill is here, we get another Disney composer.Side Note: There are complaints/inquiries that this movie is too violent. Worrying about boundaries like that subverts all the principles of film, especially film made with ""passion"".  Mel already wrecked us with 'Braveheart', what has he to lose here?  His soul?I didn't hate this for reasons I listed earlier, but Mel could've done so much more.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",The Passion of the Christ
110,gregsrants,No emotional attachment leaves me with just blood and gore.,5,26 February 2004,"I cannot remember a movie that has come out with more controversy or media coverage than Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ.  In 1997, Titanic had all the headlines during production because of its increasing budget.  In 1992, gays and lesbians were up in arms over Basic Instincts portrayal of a lesbian murderer.  But ironically enough, maybe no movie has had this much attention since Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ in 1988.As much as we as critics like to think we are not swayed or influenced in any way before a films release, it is hard not to overlook what The Passion of the Christ has thrown at us before its theatrical run.  For instance, I already knew that star Jim Caviezel was struck by lightening while filming, (twice!).  I knew the press was reporting that Jews were worried about the anti-Semitism this movie would project.  I knew that the Pope had seen the film and the Vatican had supposedly approved the film, only to later recant the statement saying they offered no such acceptance.  Heck, I even knew that it was Mel Gibson's hand holding the spike that nailed Christ to the cross in the film.  All this knowledge and I had yet to even see a trailer.The Passion of the Christ is the story of the final twelve hours in the life of the Biblical Jesus of Nazarene.  The film begins with his capture and follows the torture and abuse endured by Jesus as he is tried by his peers and eventually crucified for the sins of man.  Jim Caviezel (Frequency) plays Jesus and spends most of the movie reacting to brutal whippings, beatings and torture that lead to his eventual crucifixion.  Monica Bellucci is the only other name of note in the film, playing Magdalen, and is relegated to the background with few lines and even less impact on the overall story.For those of us that know the basics of the Biblical teachings, all the major components of our Sunday school lessons are represented.  We see Peter denying he knew Christ three times before the cock crows, we see Judas both receiving his 30 pieces of silver for betraying his king and we see Jesus heal the solider who's ear was cut off during the skirmish with the apostles at the time of his arrest.  Not much from the scriptures details of Christ's final hours has been spared.  The story is brutal and relentless in its merciless portrayal of the man that had to die in order to save mankind from our increasing sin.But does this make a good movie?  Not really.  I could not help but think of how emotionally lacking the film was for the non-practicing Christian. The death and resurrection of Christ is only poignant if you understand the life, and Gibson does not spend much time in developing what brought us to that moment in which the movie begins.  There are a few flashbacks of the Final Supper, Jesus as a carpenter and the Sermon on the Mount, but nothing that helps us understand or become emotionally involved with the character. With this background desperately lacking, the movie is therefore simply about the brutality and the blood spilled through violence and torture, without much story or character development.  This lead me to think that if the movie were in the vein of say,  Lord of the Rings and were a three-part epic, Passion being the final chapter, there would not be a dry eye in the theatre.  We would have grown to know and love the man and at least feel for his suffering, rather than just awe at the sheer ruthlessness of the bloodshed.But does this make for a bad movie?  Not really.  Sure, more back story would have been appreciated and Gibson needs to learn how to do more with his female leads when directing than shun them into the background, but The Passion of the Christ has some real stellar camera work and its production values are top rate.  No matter your opinion on the overall project, you won't come out of the theatre saying you were 'bored'.Much has been talked and written about the movie's excessive violence and it should not go unsaid here.  We see in graphic Technicolor Christ being so sadistically punished that I found myself thankful there were subtitles to take my eyes off the blood curling beatings.  That might make for an interesting sell with the religious community that usually spend considerable time condemning Hollywood for its depiction of violence in films.In all, I think the movie will split is acceptance right down the middle. Those that are of a religion in which the story is a depiction of the sermons they have heard for years, will probably enjoy the film and have more of an emotional attachment to the characters due to their ingrained teachings on the subject.  Those who are just looking for the next Saturday night movie, may be disappointed that outside of the exertion of abuse, there isn't much substance.  I guess, I fall into those in the middle.  I know the story, I understood the suffering, but I just didn't see what Gibson was trying to accomplish.",The Passion of the Christ

It does depict brutal cruelty, the accounts are true, but it's within the context of the story that Mel Gibson and his writing partner chose to tell, and it is told in a deeply powerful way. The casting is brilliant, particularly Jim Caviezel, and there are superb flashbacks throughout, adding tremendous depth and, overall, making the film bearable to watch.

113,johnstonjames,"Cruel, But effective And Unconventional Telling Of The Life Of Jesus",9,23 April 2011,"at first i didn't take to this telling of the gospel. i found it to be too violent for my taste. at least as far as the gospel is concerned. after all, the Crucifixion descriptions in the Bible are simply not that graphic or explicit in nature. Mel Gibson based this film on the visions of some famous nun who had ""passion"" visions. it's actually kind of apocryphal in it's bloodlust.however, the more i see this film, the more i think it's really pretty good. it's definitely one of the more interesting depictions of Jesus's life on film. not hard to do since most Jesus movies tend to slip into really conventional formula when telling the story.Mel Gibson made many wise choices here to avoid familiar territory. for one thing, the decision to have the actors speak Aramaic was brilliant. i've seen many corny ""English spoken"" Christ movies where the use of English speakings actors can render it flat or fraudulent. having sat through 'The Greatest Story Ever told' many times, i always smirk and cringe every time John(the ""Duke"")Wayne stands on a hilltop at the final and drawls ""surley this man wuz the sun uv gawd"". jeez. the Aramaic in this film is far more believable and convincing.Gibson also spices up the usual story with a ""unusual"" amount of grisly violence. i think this is a little ""dubious"" for a Christ film, but hey, it does make it a lot more interesting and entertaining than usual Christian outings. i just think most Christian fanz of the film should question this, since not even the Bible depicts it as THIS violent. not to mention the fact that you have to watch half of this movie cringing with your eyes closed(at least i do).questionable ""entertainment"" tactics aside, much of this is some of the most effective re-creations of Christ history i've ever seen on film. the final scene as Jesus walks away from his tomb is, well, absolutely amazing, and the most effective ending i've seen for any of the ""Christ films"".all in all this is really pretty good cinema, and a unconventional break from typically conventional subject matter. but i still personally feel that even though it is very well done, it's still a little too violent and that doesn't inspire me in a religious way. for pure, harmonious inspiration, i think i'll stick with Tim rice and Lloyd Webber.",The Passion of the Christ
114,rebeljenn,a powerful film,7,27 February 2006,"'The Passion of the Christ' is a moving film portraying Jesus's final days. The film shows pain and endurance as well as the character's forgiveness in those that had wronged him. James Caviezel plays the perfect part of Jesus, a man filled with sensitivity who learns pain and betrayal. The photography in the film and the landscapes also deserve a special mention and enhance the film.I think that 'Passion of the Christ' can be enjoyed by anyone who is interested in historical films, even if they do not practice the Christain religion. It is ultimately a film about pain and betrayal and a good biography/documentary about Jesus, one of the most famous people in religion that ever existed. The film seems to take on a powerful meaning of its own to an audience who is deeply spiritual. However, the story is a little weak in some places. The story seems to capture pain more than tell a story. Many of the scenes are filled with torture and images of Jesus being tortured. More of a story and less beatings would have made this a better film, but I believe the director Mel Gibson's choice was to make people realise the suffering that this man went through at the hands of other humans. I do not think this was necessary, and in my opinion, it would have been a better film with some of the suffering cut down and more of a story behind it.The film is good and above average because it succeeds in being a powerful film, and the acting and photography make it stand out. It also works as a documentary, and I think it has been successful in getting people interested about the subject.",The Passion of the Christ

Being so correct to The Bible the movie is very fine watching for especially those who do believe. Getting a lot of blood spilled the movie made me cry and Gibson deserves a lot of honour who's dared making this film. Mel Gibson has made a lot of controversial stuff around this movie, but...that's something we'd expected! You can put it in a way that it is one of the greatest, and not if, the greatest movie ever made, but in the same time, it doesn't fit to the picture itself. We get to see Jesus being tortured heavily and the audience sat there either crying or shocked, sadism on a high level reflected from Gibson who's been a lethal weapon earlier now shows that he is a Christian himself out threw this movie. You sat there watching a movie that had a creepy and evil undertone much of the time, and sometimes you wanted to vomit seeing Caviezel / Jesus getting wiped over his back with the most brutal torture-methods and houling in pain.

116,grahamsj3,"Good, but missing something",7,5 September 2004,"Mel Gibson bankrolled this film himself to avoid any entanglements with a studio and he therefore had complete control over the content. He used an inexpensive cast, with only one ""brand name"", James Caviezel, cast as Jesus. The dialog is in Aramaic, but that doesn't take away anything. I think what this film is missing is that we only see Jesus from his betrayal through his torture and crucifixion. The audience is robbed of knowing WHO Jesus was. There is but a brief moment of Jesus teaching, of miracles, of his boyhood. There is no character development of Jesus at all. Once Jesus is betrayed, the film gets very bloody very fast. There are gruesome scenes of Jesus having his skin flayed. The Romans hilarity seems acted, but that kind of laughter is hard to do convincingly. This happens during the crucifixion as well. There is so much blood in this film that it begins to lose its shock value after just a little while. I'm sure Mr. Gibson was trying to show the kind of suffering that Christ went through, but went a bit too far, I think. Caviezel did a good job as the suffering Jesus. Overall, I think the film was a missed opportunity.",The Passion of the Christ
117,esteban1747,Last hours of Christ life,7,4 April 2004,"Oh, my god, how heavy is to see this film. The life of Christ is something interesting to anyone living in catholic society, but it is more interesting when you have read several other versions. Atheists always said that Christ was an invention while several other writers like Robert Graves gave us versions quite different from the gospels. Here the plot of the film tries to follow the gospels, but to what extent these gospels are true? Nobody knows. I agree with those that criticized the film because of its excessive violence. It would have been much better to provide more scenes about the life of Christ before the last dinner, his work with poor people. The film starts with Christ heavily sad after the last dinner and his then behavior with the apostles. From the book of Graves, I am not sure about the wickedness of Judas as it is represented in the film as well as the kindness of Pilate. In any case, this film is good for debates, Mel Gibson produced it in a way he wanted and in a way he thinks Christ behaved in his last moments and how was killed. Let's hope that this material may stimulate the production of other related films looking for the truth of Christ life. In my modest opinion, the film is not anti-Semitic, to assert that is to admit that gospels are certainly anti-Semitic. The Judaist priests of that time were against any action and belief of Christ, and nobody should doubt about. They were jealous and afraid of loosing their power, and this fact has nothing to do negatively with the whole people of that country at that time.",The Passion of the Christ

Jim Caviezel, is truly a grand image of Jesus.This is among the most powerful and most moving films i have ever seen. I admit I only saw it once, but I've never been captivated by a film so intensely as this. everything in this film is great, from the acting, the haunting score, the grim cinematography, the symbolic figures revealed, which are also used in the bible itself (great Gibson), and above all, the accurate dialect, and realistic make up.Take heed, this is not a clean film.

119,FloatingOpera7,Not The Best Passion Film,5,14 April 2006,"The Passion Of The Christ (2004) Starring James Caviezel, Maya Morgenstern, Monica Bellucci, Luca Lionello, Hristo Shopov, Giacinto Ferro, Director Mel Gibson This is Mel Gibson's unforgettable, highly expensive film project which sold out and made millions at the box office back in February of 2004. Now, after getting enough courage to see it, I can only give this 6 out of 10 points and that's only fair because at least I love the cinematography and practically accurate depiction of the period. Actor turned director Mel Gibson is a traditional Catholic (likes his Mass in Latin and not the common people's languages) and reportedly claimed that God ordained the making of this film. It is a manifestation of his ego as a director and a new angle to his films about violence and undefeatable masculine heroes, this time disguised as the greatest hero of them all- Jesus Christ. Instead of honoring traditional Passion films of the past (The Greatest Story Ever Told being the best) he shows off his taste for extreme violence, blood, gore, action and loudness. Jim Caviezel stars as Jesus, looking far too Aryan than Jewish (a white Jesus with BLUE EYES ??)when it's more than obvious that Jesus was Semitic/tan/Mediterrenean Jewish. Maya Morgenstern plays his mother Mary, and again, she too looks too white/European for the real Jewish Mary. But, it is her performance I like best. You can tell she took the role seriously and religiously and she becomes Mary whole-heartedly. Caviezel, on the other hand, was taking on a role that better actors have performed and with more passion- Max Von Sidow stands out. At least, Caviezel is better than the Jesus in the Jesus Christ Super Star film. But Caviezel doesn't do a satisfactory Jesus for me. He is too self-conscious and doesn't do anything truly compelling. Rather than honoring Jesus by portraying him as a Resurrected Hero (THERE IS NO Resurrection IN THIS FILM ?? WHAT'S THAT ABOUT ? THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF Christianity. Gibson makes it seem that Jesus never resurrected. All we see is handsome Caviezel being brutally beaten into a bloody pulp whipped, scarred and weakened so that he looks nothing like the real Jesus. Perhaps it's reality but no Christian or Catholic should have to see that. The greater Passion films didn't emphasize the violence and the crude reality, but the glorification of Jesus' sacrifice as a triumph and the Resurrection. This film is extremely frightening and disturbing and despite all the praise it received, I hate it. It even caused the death of an old lady in Kansas. Does Gibson know that ? Why did everyone like a film made by the star of such bloody action movies as Mad Max and Braveheart ?",The Passion of the Christ
120,raymond-15,A blood bath of suffering affecting us all,8,9 September 2004,"Despite the fact that we know the story in advance. this version of Jesus' suffering impacts unsparingly on our senses and the memory of it lingers on for days afterward.Crucifixion of course was nothing new 2000 years ago. Many suffered the horrifying pain of being nailed to a wooden cross....a slow and ghastly death. And one has to ask how many innocent people were disposed of in this way. It is said that Jesus had to make this supreme sacrifice to fulfil what was written in the Holy Scriptures. Obligatory or not, nothing changes the pain and suffering.Mel Gibson attempts to show the events leading up to the crucifixion. He shows us every detail. We feel every stroke of the lash, every piercing of the flesh. In my opinion it was well researched and the parts of the story unrecorded in the Holy Bible were imagined and used to fill out the narrative. None of us was there on that eventful day so there are bound to be differences of opinion. I tend to believe that the nails were driven through the wrists, but most of the artists of medieval times show the wounds in the hands. I guess it is more dramatic in scenes where the arms are outstretched showing the palms.I found the ending rather abrupt...like an addendum or an afterthought. Perhaps it was found necessary to give hope and relief to the audience weighed down by the continual scourging and lashing and terrible pain. Blood...blood...and more blood.John Caviezel did a great job as Jesus. He looked right, not like some of the previous blue-eyed handsome guys hanging on the cross with a little trickle of blood on the brow and hands and feet. This was no sanitized version. No one knows what the real Jesus looked like. He was a Jew certainly and we know little more than that. Mel Gibson's version of events seemed to me pretty accurate and deserves our highest praise.",The Passion of the Christ
121,TheOtherFool,What's all the fuss?,4,14 September 2004,"I am rather surprised to see discussions here on the IMDb-boards, as well as everyday discussions about this movie, and it's relation to Christianity. As if Christians will 'like' this film, and non-Christians won't. I honestly think that's a bit silly. Why not talk about what we've just seen?I for one cannot see how The Passion Of The Christ is so important to Christians (I will consider myself one as well). Although some scenes are important (the forgiving of the person on the cross, the quote 'we should love who hate us', and others), 'The Passion' consist 90% of Jesus beaten and kicked. Surely you can make a movie about it, but I fail to see how that, and therefore this movie, is 'important to watch' or on the other side 'a movie just for Christians'.Having said that, I was rather disappointed in the film. I thought it was a bit boring and not really focussing on important issues. Maybe that wasn't the idea behind this film, and was it only meant to show Jesus' suffering, but then I cannot understand why so much is thought of this film. As 'The Passion' is just showing a really small bit about what Christianity really is all about.So let's just hope someone will pick it up from here and will make some movie(s) that make more sense. Because to be honest, I don't think much of The Passion Of The Christ. 4/10.",The Passion of the Christ
122,OriginalMovieBuff21,A Masterpiece!!!,10,21 April 2004,"This is one film that will touch the world. When I saw this film i was impressed in all of the scenes and also I was full of sorrow for Jesus. It was a powerful, brutal, and provoking movie. I will sure to buy this film on DVD and try not to cry again. This was a piece of art and should get in 250 movies of all time. I can't really understand why people have put this film down and why it got a 7.4 rating. Well I don't think this is the best movie ever made but sure is quite appealing and I have become more into my religion after i saw this film. It also got 3 stars which I'm also very curious about. This was an excellent film. A true masterpiece!!!10/10",The Passion of the Christ
123,EmperorNortonII,A New Chapter of the Gospels,8,6 March 2004,"Mel Gibson caused great controversy with his new movie ""The Passion of the Christ.""  There were worries that with his Fundamentalist views, the Jews would be singled out as the ones who killed Jesus.  Granted, Pontius Pilate is depicted as rather sympathetic to Jesus, but that's not to say all Romans in the movie are on the side of Christ.  Likewise, not all Jews are against him.  It seems that Caiaphas and the Pharisees have their own agenda.  But the story of the Crucifixion should not be a question as to which religious or ethnic group should bear the blame for the whole thing.  You think more in terms of individuals, who was more instrumental in Jesus' martyrdom. ""Passion"" is a very powerful movie, and not just for its thought-provoking elements.  The violence is shown unflinchingly. (The scene in which Jesus is flayed is particularly brutal!) The fact that the dialogue is entirely in Aramaic and Latin does not take away any of the movie's power.  One may never know the whole story behind the death of Jesus, but ""Passion"" offers more interesting speculation.",The Passion of the Christ
124,nicholls_les,Most realistic Portrayal of what happened,9,7 April 2009,"This is a film that you cannot watch without 'feeling' something. The portrayal by Jim Caviezel is outstanding and I would say the best portrayal of Jesus I have seen. The film left me with 2 opposing lines of thought. Firstly it is a shame that Mel Gibson slanted it to his Catholic beliefs, the over use of Mary and everyone calling her Mother and her looking like a Nun along with Mary Magdelin spoiled what would have been a 10/10 film. In fact modern Catholic priests are more like the religious leaders in this film than they are like Jesus. That said it is the most accurate portrayal of what happened. If you read all the Bible accounts you can see that it was indeed the religious leaders of the day who wanted Jesus put to death, Pilate was a politician afraid of what Rome would do if he had another uprising and this is very well shown in the film. The disgusting actions of the High Priest and Sanhedrin are accurately shown as is the way the Apostles reacted. The violence is extreme but so was the way that Jesus himself was treated according to scripture. many who were scourged by the Romans died as a result, it was called the half way death. Pilate may well have thought that showing Jesus this way would have softened the crowds baying for Jesus' blood, but they really wanted the man dead. All the aspects of Jesus death were prophesied hundred of years before and historians of the time attested to the fact that Jesus did indeed die as is shown ( namely Josephus, Tertulian etc ) The way Satan was shown added another dimension to the film that did not really detract but rather enhanced it, I especially liked the scene at the end when Satan screams up to heaven. There are different views regarding the way Jesus would have been killed back then. Romans would sometimes just nail a person to a tree or post, and the arms were more often above the persons head causing them to suffocate. Over all I would say that this is one of the best films ever made and certainly the best made on this subject. So despite Mels Caltholic leanings it is still a film I watch again and again and value in my DVD collection.",The Passion of the Christ
125,cinematic_aficionado,Devoted to Christ,10,17 April 2004,"Like many others the reason behind my watching this movie is the controversy it has created, obviously working for Mr Gibson as an excellent marketing tool.This movie is visually stunning goes deep into the aspect of crucifiction as no other movie has simply because the audience spends together with the Christ His last day on Earth.We become witnesses to His trial, torture, standing by Him as He suffers horrible unspeakable punishment for which He is trully unworthy and He accepts it as He gets strength by His heavenly father.Many describe this movie as violent. I see it as realistic and to me its greatest power and success is that it makes you think: ""Oh my God. This man really suffered A LOT for us and our sins.""10/10",The Passion of the Christ
126,osloj,Worthless Forte into Gibson's Mania,1,6 October 2004,"This film, beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ, never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing, violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views, Mel Gibson, a schizo if there ever was one, does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ, who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious ""crucifixion"" which ""saved man"", but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since, especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs, unless you are a fanatical Christian or hate the Mad Max films.",The Passion of the Christ
127,t_atzmueller,A very interesting mix between Torture-Porn and historic study with homo-erotic undertones,8,16 November 2014,"First of all, let me begin by saying: I liked the movie. I love fantasy-, history- and horror-films, and don't mind if the gore sometimes comes thick and sick. Sue me. I've seen most, from the 80's Slasher-films to the modern Torture-Porn a la ""Saw"", ""Hostel"", ""A Serbian Film"" and ""The Passion of Chris"" sits very comfortably among all of them. At the same time this movie depicts pretty accurately how criminals were dealt with during this time. Harsh, perhaps, but such were the times.The flashback scenes were a little redundant and boring, but when the film was running in the cinema, it gave the viewers time to visit the loo (it's a 2+ hour film after all) and fetch some more popcorn until the action continued.Some viewers have complained about the ""homo-erotic undertones"" and sadomasochistic aspects (the whipping, being buggered by soldiers, the convict being displayed half-naked most of the time, King Herod a transvestite, etc). There's also a very telling scene at the end, where the protagonist is crucified between two equally half-clad gentlemen; one being the more ""butch""-type, the other gentler, slightly more feminine looking. There's a distinct affection between the protagonist and the latter, symbolized through gentle glances and sweet-talking (unfortunately I don't speak neither Aramaic nor Yiddish and the subtitle-option was somehow malfunctioning), despite being nailed to crucifixes. Perhaps most telling is a scene where a Roman governor points toward the convict and states: ""Ecce Homo!"" There are other such aspects, which may be a little strong to some people's moral standards including fetishes (the protagonist washing some men's feet while talking about ""loving each other"" and ""eating his flesh""). But I believe in this time and age we should be a little more tolerant. Like they say: ""Don't like what you'll see? Don't peep through the keyhole"", and all that.However, I do understand who many people criticized the depiction of women and Jews. The latter are generally shown as vile, treacherous, or toothless degenerates that would well have fitted in ""Der Ewige Jude"". As to the female characters: As said, one is a prostitute, the other one is the Devil and the protagonists mother seems to be around the same age as her son, which would point to a very (very!) young teen-pregnancy. One got the distinct feeling that the director has very little love for either one group.The ending was a little lame, I must admit that. I don't mind if genres sometimes overlap but in the last second turning a straight Torture-flick into a Zombie-movie. In addition to that: there never was a sequel, which the cliffhanger seems to have implied.I'd still give the movie 8 from 10 points. If you enjoyed it likewise, I can only recommend you the French film ""Martyrs"", which runs around a very similar storyline. Even if some of it is equally as hard to chew and swallow, keep telling yourself: ""It's only a movie"".",The Passion of the Christ
128,CinematicInceptions,Intense and personally torturous. Not corny like much Christian media or boring like much of the Bible.,7,1 October 2014,"This is one of very few Christian movies that isn't a guilt lecture or a bad, corny story of someone making an implausible 180. The whole thing is really done for effect. It falls very low on the list of fun movies, and it certainly isn't enjoyable to watch, but that is the point of it. The gore and torture are very realistic and personal, though the blood sometimes comes in unrealistic amounts. So it isn't a movie for people with relatively weak stomachs for such things, though you can always close your eyes if you choose. A fair amount of the more painful moments are shown in slow-motion, again for effect. In terms of historical and Biblical accuracy, there is nothing that can be criticized since everything is basically done from scripture verbatim. Still, it is much more intense than the plain Biblical verses that don't go into much detail. What is described in one sentence in the bible is shown in detail in the film. The acting is pretty good, though some of the pleasure that the Roman soldiers take in torturing Jesus can be easily construed as somewhat overblown. Then again, if you're stuck with a job like that, there's only so much else you can do to enjoy it (by the way that statement was defending the acting and script, not the actual soldiers). Unlike in some dramas, especially religious ones that try and fail not to make their theatrical version of a bible story as boring as it is in scripture, the delivery of the lines and the movements of the actors aren't performed with unrealistic emotion and drama. Two things that were included in this movie that aren't drawn entirely from scripture are the roles of John the apostle and Simon. We see John with Mary throughout the movie watching Jesus get tortured, something that isn't emphasized in the biblical accounts. Simon is also given a strong personality that is never described as he stands up for Jesus at one point. There isn't too much room to poke holes in it. As I said before, there is no blatant morality lecturing that is going to turn people off. My one little problem with it is that Jesus is again played by a white actor when he was Arabian. Not that James Caveziel did a bad job, but Jesus is always made to be white and it just irritates me. But anyway, that's a pretty small issue. The general effect of the movie is really more physical than emotional, though it does make you appreciate the sacrifice and pain Jesus was made to endure (that is if you are Christian, and even if you aren't, which is perfectly okay). I suppose it could move some viewers to repentance, but probably not to conversion. That being said, it does not have a feel like fictional Christian movies. There are no distinguishing characteristics from the aforementioned genre included here. So if you are absolutely disgusted with the way other movies made for religious inspiration try to shove morals in the face of the audience and do a generally poor job on the movie, you can rest assured that you won't find any of that in this movie. I am a practicing catholic, and I have always felt that, as good as the morals presented by Christian movies and media might be, they are nearly always presented in a very corny and forceful way that is likely to decrease the catholic population. The main characters, whether historical or fictional, are always either too self- righteous or act like their tiny moral flaws make them horrible and unworthy people. Anyhow, the point is that none of that sort of is found here. As to recommendations, I would say that it is a good watch for most theists, but shouldn't be viewed by anyone averse to the sight of blood. Though the movie is anything but fun, I give it an 8.6/10.",The Passion of the Christ
129,chaswe-28402,Off-putting,5,7 September 2016,"A lot of work evidently went into this production. The religiosity was a terminal turn-off. So, half-mark stars awarded. During the gory bits, which was most of the time, I kept asking myself how the illusions were maintained. It was just a movie, after all. There were copious quantities of ketchup, red paint, beetroot juice, red ink, splashed around. Didn't understand why the spillage had to be mopped up off the floor though. Once or twice some of the whipping seemed to be really happening, although I suppose that's not possible. Jesus's eye effects seemed aided and achieved by contact lenses. Their colour wasn't natural. Did he have false eyelashes ? He fainted rather more often than was strictly necessary. Because of my constant knee-jerk questioning of the documentary reality of what I was seeing, the visual effectiveness of the sadism was substantially diminished, so it didn't really bother me. I just didn't believe it.As for the message, I don't buy it either, and never have. At my school we went to chapel every weekday morning for fifteen minutes. Then we went twice on Sundays, and listened to a sermon at the second session. After I was confirmed, because I conformed, I sometimes went three times on Sunday. However, none of this had any effect at all on my lack of faith in the myth. Unconvinced, permanently unpersuaded.I prefer the pagan deities of the north. Odin, a late god, was partly modelled on Jesus: he hung on a tree for three days, and got stabbed in the side. Unlike the ethnic cleansing histories in the Bible, some of the pagan stories were humorous. The gods could also be sexy and occasionally beautiful, which is not characteristic of either the Old or New Testament. Thor was popular, but he got hi-jacked by Father Christmas. The Hebrew god was punitive and jealous, even when Christian. So Mel's evangelical message fell on stony ground here, in spite of its graphic intensity. All the actors were good in their parts, given that they had nothing intelligible to say to those without the languages. Presumably their speeches were dubbed, anyway.",The Passion of the Christ
130,Al_The_Strange,"""The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.""",10,31 March 2013,"The birth and death of Jesus has been covered thoroughly across many biblical epics, but there has always been a gleaming Hollywood polish to them. If you look at films like Ben Hur or The Greatest Story Ever Told, there's surprisingly little passion in the Passion of the Christ; it's as if these films sugar-coat the events in favor of crafting a safe and fluffy audience-pleasing spectacle. That's not to say that these films lack merit; on the contrary, they are most valuable for bringing the events to life in a manner that all Christians can identify with, young or old. Their universal appeal makes them go-to classics, especially for Easter time.In 2004, Mel Gibson dared to give us a portrayal of Jesus' death that is far more uncompromising, and arguably closer to what could have really happened. The Passion of the Christ is not a colorful or happy affair; it's a harrowing experience that lingers on the cruelty and violence, constantly underscoring the hideous nature of mankind. This is not an easy thing to watch; the camera tracks every blow Jesus takes, every cruel moment in which He is shamed and spit upon, every crack of the whip that breaks His flesh, and every hard step He takes toward Golgotha. The film goes on and on, purposefully placing the audience into His footsteps so that we ultimately feel His agony and face the ugliness of what happened. The film was highly controversial on its release, and remains so; many audiences can't stomach the brutality of the film, and would argue that such violence is unnecessary. Many others have harped on the director's personal sensibilities, temperament, and antisemitism, arguing that the film is too hateful and purposefully asserts an antisemitic agenda. Such criticisms have proved to be a source of heated debate, even to this day.Regardless of how you regard this film, one thing is certain: it is a uniquely intense experience that brings the events to life in a way that no other film before it has. The Passion has a blunt but jarring and powerful cinematic experience that makes the characters and situations fresh and inspiring. Even if you're intimately familiar with the story, the film takes some striking artistic liberties that reinforce the themes and ideas of the film sublimely.The storytelling for this film is impeccable. It follows the book of Luke practically word for word, but takes a few deviations to cover some important flashbacks that reinforce the characters and the messages of Jesus. It's hard to know how close to reality the film comes, but it comes very close, especially in regards to its look, style, and language (it's mostly the violence that borders on being ridiculously overdone). The film does a fantastic job of covering the passages of the Bible accurately, and emphasizing the importance of Jesus' sacrifice with tangible themes and messages. By the film's end, after seeing so much cruelty being poured into Jesus, I really did have a much better understanding of the importance of His sacrifice and suffering, and it made the experience of the film most worthwhile in the long run.Despite its artistic liberties and emphasis on violence, the film has a very strong and vivid style, with incredible photography and editing techniques. Acting is decent; Jim Caviezel has limited dialogue to work with, but shows enough nuances in his physical performance to bring Jesus to life in a believable and distinctive manner. The supporting cast is really decent as well. Writing is effective, especially in the way it incorporates the Bible's words in with the drama. The film is most notable for using authentic Aramaic and Latin dialogue. This production uses some very detailed and real-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music has an authentic feel to it as well; it's quite haunting, but at times it maintains a subtle sense of divinity.I personally value The Passion the most for its powerful, vivid presentation, and for helping me understand the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in a refreshingly bold context. For its brutal violence and arguable antisemitic overtones, this is not a film I would universally recommend to audiences; the best I can say is that if you think you can stomach the experience, you should at least give it a try. You may find this film rewarding.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",The Passion of the Christ
131,Cinemaniac1984,"Powerful viewing, but the unflinchingly graphic violence was unnecessary.",8,21 May 2016,"Mel Gibson sits in the director's chair to depict the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion. The movie has sparked a lot of controversy with claims of anti-Semitism, accuracy of the story, and it's extremely graphic violence which was very unnecessary. Jim Caviezel does a fine job with his portrayal of Jesus Christ which is certainly not an easy role to take on.While Mel Gibson wanted to capture the realism of that particular time, as I said before the violence was unflinchingly graphic and quite sadistic. It's no wonder a lot of people found the movie to be unbearable and without question this is not a movie for children. I've seen plenty of violent movies in my life and while I grew up on a steady diet of entertaining action movies from the Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis, Van Damme and Seagal era I felt that this was nothing that couldn't be handled. Even though it has been 11 years since I've seen The Passion of the Christ, I still found it to be uncomfortably violent and to this day it still does not sit right with me. As a young adult this was one of the rare times that I have had to avert my eyes a few times, particularly during the crucifixion.The Passion of the Christ is powerful viewing however this is something I will never watch again. By no means is it a bad movie, but the subject matter makes it to be an uncomfortable experience. I can't recommend this movie as something that is highly recommended, it is something one must decide for themselves whether to watch it or not.8/10.",The Passion of the Christ
132,majikstl,Half of the Greatest Story Ever Told,5,28 February 2004,"There is a scene in Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST wherein Mary, his mother, rushes to Jesus' side as he stumbles and falls while carrying his cross to his own crucifixion. As she reaches out to him, the film cuts to a flashback of Jesus as a child which echoes the moment: the child Jesus stumbles and falls and Mary picks him and cradles the child in her arms. It is a sweet and tender moment in a film noticeably lacking in tenderness or sweetness. It is a moment that suggests what a great film THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST could have been.The film is about the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, the hours leading to his brutal death. And that is about all that the film is about. The life, the teachings, the miracles and the humanity of Christ are either ignored or reduced to fleeting flashbacks. Even the resurrection comes off as an afterthought. THE PASSION is a film about suffering -- brutal, senseless and unrelenting suffering. All of which Gibson serves up with precious little subtlety. The entire focus of the film is on the bloody violence of the humiliation, torture and execution of Jesus. Which presumably Gibson sees as the essence of the story of Christ. But, there is a perverse element to the brutality as Gibson presents it. It is like the violence in Martin Scorsese's RAGING BULL; it is meant to horrify, yet it is lovingly filmed in slow motion to make it cinematically exciting and oddly photogenic. Like in RAGING BULL, I was less aware of the genuine brutality of the violence than I was of the cinematic technique.Worse, it was unrelenting, which instead of intensifying the experience, only served to trivialize it. First the violence was shocking, then unpleasant, then uncomfortable and then eventually simply monotonous. Maybe it is just a defense mechanism on my part, but after a while I was less interested in the fate of Jesus than I as in the amount of pain and humiliation that the actor playing the part had to endure just to get through with the filming of his role.If Gibson had used Jesus' final trek as a framework for flashing back to his life and his ministry, alternating scenes of Jesus' nobility with scenes of his savage humiliation, the film could have shown us both the point and purpose of Jesus' existence, as well as giving some point and purpose to showing the ensuing violence. As is, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is less a religious drama than a crime scene recreation -- sort of a CSI: JUDEA.I can't comment on Jim Caviezel's performance as Christ because there is so little to judge. Mostly what is shown of Jesus is of him in tortured physical and mental agony. The few fleeting flashbacks suggest that his Jesus might have had a personality, but any such display of humanity just doesn't fit into Gibson's vision. For most of the film, Caviezel is more stuntman than actor, enduring one strenuous brutal act after another. I can't think of any other film where the main character is on screen in almost every scene, yet in the end leaves no lasting impression as an individual. Here Jesus is not God or man, just a blood-splattered religious icon. Yet at the same time, we are supposed to be in awe of Jesus' courage, because he could, if he wanted to, perform a miracle and save himself. But this Jesus seems less like a determined believer than a victim beaten into passivity. Gibson's Jesus endures, but doesn't perseveres.Indeed, Hristo Shopov as Pontius Pilate is given more opportunity to give depth and shape to his character than Caviezel. For that matter, the film lavishes more interest on Pilate than on Jesus, either of the Marys, his disciples and certainly more than on the Jewish priests whose motives for persecuting Jesus are left vague. Is the film anti-Semitic? Well, I don't think Gibson intended it to be, simply because raising such an issue would distract from the sadistic destruction of Christ.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST has some striking imagery, some strong performances and genuine craftsmanship. But it is like an action film that has been severely edited down so that only the action scenes are left; anything that might slow the pace -- backstory, characterization, humanity -- ends up on the editing room floor, even if it renders the final work incomprehensible. Gibson wants us to know that Jesus suffered for our sins. We get that message very early on and we don't need it repeated for two hours. But there is so much more to the Christ's story and it is Gibson who just doesn't get it.",The Passion of the Christ
133,buccaneer21,A Bloody Film About Jesus,10,11 July 2019,"Mel Gibson directs a film about the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus entitled,""The Passion of the Christ"". It stars Jim Caviezel as Jesus together with Maia Morgenstern, Monica Bellucci and Hristo Shopov.It starts on the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane wherein Jesus is praying to God about the suffering that he is about to experience until his resurrection from the dead.No question that the movie is more about the passion of Jesus rather providing a new spiritual message to the viewer watching it. It definitely provides tons of pornographic bloody scenes during the suffering and death of Jesus.Too bad that these scenes have definitely overcome the spiritual message of how Jesus died for our sins and for our salvation.No question that one would have been entertained by it. What saved this movie from complete ruin is that the resurrection of Jesus was presented. At least,the viewer gets to understand how Jesus suffered for us.Nevertheless,that remains subtle unlike the bloody scenes which will definitely stick to the mind of the viewer.",The Passion of the Christ
134,supertom-3,Unique Movie Going Experience!,7,22 April 2004,"This is highly controversial stuff indeed, but after all the fuss this film has got for it's violence and anti-Semitism, this turns out to be causing all sorts of arguments about the subject of the film rather than the film as a piece of work. Does the story of Christ's last hours make a good movie. In many ways yes, in terms of it as an emotional and provocative experience and no in terms of story and characters.Mel Gibson's film looks great everything on surface value is great. The story is something everyone knows. It rings true in many ways, all the basics that everyone knows about, the last supper, Judas's portrayal, Jesus' torture, the crucifixion itself. These things remain agreed upon but getting into finer details and you can't please everyone as Gibson has found out. Many have complained that it's an exercise in violent excess, this is certainly a good point. The violence is not candy coated, or hinted at, we see it and experience it and it is probably the most gut-wrenching film in terms of the violence. The fact that the film is only focusing on the last hours of Christ and it obviously requires previous knowledge, the story doesn't play out with a conventional narrative and there is no real character development. It is almost like it is a documentary shot like a movie. What is obvious is that this film is artistically very good. The cinematography, the music, it is all gorgeous. The cast are very good. Jim Caviezel is superb. He deserves an Oscar for this in possibly one of the most enduring and difficult roles an actor could go through. He gives a performance that exceeds any expectation anyone could have had of him as an actor. I have thought of Caviezel as a good actor but this performance puts him a grade up. Also  Maia Morgenstern is also excellent in her American debut. She gives a moving performance as Mary. Morgenstern is a very good actress but I don't see her breaking into Hollywood, although she will appear in the next Dolph lundgren movie. Also Monica Bellucci stars as well and manages to look gorgeous throughout, despite the best efforts of the make up crew to dirty up her face.
Overall this is best described as an emotional experience, which is pretty involving. As a movie it doesn't always work in filmic terms but the direction and the artistic side is excellent. ***1/2",The Passion of the Christ

This is a very mediocre film in every respect. Don't get me wrong I saw it and thought I've seen worse, but I have seen a whole lot better as well. This came out at the right time for people who wanted to see something to help out their faith or whatever you want to call it. But from a pure film standpoint meaning you don't look at the subject matter, you see that it is a very mediocre film. If you want to see some excellent Mel Gibson films stick with the Oscar winning ""Braveheart"" & the very visually striking ""Apocalypto."" It seems that even people that don't watch films often or even know what a good film is loved this just because it pertained to their faith. Sorry folks just because it has a decent budget and looks good doesn't make it a good film! So all you that just love this film just because it's about Jesus & gave this a 10 (over 23,000 of you ill-equipped, uninformed people who otherwise know nothing about movies) well you are just inflating an otherwise mediocre flick. If you want to learn about what happened, read some history & don't count this torture/porn as part of your knowledge other than this being a movie!",The Passion of the Christ
136,maria2023,What Jesus Goes Through In His Last Twelve Hours,10,2 August 2019,"""The Passion of the Christ"" is a film directed by Mel Gibson that tells the ordeal of Jesus in the last 12 hours of his life from agonizing in prayer at the Garden of Gethsemane until his death on the cross at Golgotha. It also provides a glimpse of the resurrection of Jesus at the end. Jim Caviezel stars as Jesus Christ.The movie will definitely provide an impact to the viewer. Evidently,it will be of affect each viewer differently whether one is a Christian or not. One may see it as extremely violent and sadistic especially when seeing the ordeal that Jesus had to go through while being scourged at the pillars,being crowned with thorns,carrying the cross, and getting crucified on the cross.Others may see it as a spiritual message as it may provide them a glimpse of what Jesus had to go through for the salvation of mankind from sin,renewing mankind's standing with God, and the redemption of mankind from sin.While others,may see it as a different depiction of the passion and death of Jesus. And there are many more.Overall,the movie will definitely provide one something about Jesus particularly during his passion and death on the cross.",The Passion of the Christ
137,paulcreeden,Blasphemy a la Braveheart?,3,27 April 2006,"Where to begin? Well, I have waited until now to see this film on DVD. That probably says quite a bit about my feelings on the subject matter itself. I will also disclose that I have had seven years of Jesuit education and once applied to that order in my youth. I have also studied religions and philosophy for the past 35 years with interest and scientific skepticism. This film, in my opinion, reflects the religious and historical sophistication of a twelve-year-old boy who is destined to become a sadomasochist. I had read the press about Mr. Gibson's being born again. I fear he was born again as a bad film director. I was particularly amused by the use of an Italian cast in the fine tradition of the old Biblical prosciutto of the 1960s. And this film will hopefully share the catacomb where those films are buried. If I were a Palestinian, Jew or Muslim, I would most likely be justifiably horrified at the sham use of one of my culture's early languages overlaid on European mannerisms and emotions, derived from Renaissance Italian paintings. Really! This movie's popularity among Evangelical Christians seems predictable given their apparent aversion to thoughtful religious study and debate. If you believe the Bible is literal truth, then this is indeed the movie for you. And you are welcome to it.",The Passion of the Christ
138,christian123,An interesting film but nothing great,4,19 March 2005,"The Passion of the Christ is a great movie and a visually attractive one as well. Depicting the last twelve hours of Jesus (Jim Caviezel), The Passion of The Christ shows the trials, the torture and the death by crucifixion of the influential man behind one of the nation's most widespread religions. This is the first time something like this has been attempted and the results are great. Mel Gibson does such a good job of directing and he got a great cast as well. James Caviezel plays Jesus and his performance is so good you wonder why he isn't more popular. Monica Bellucci has a small role in the film but her performance is still good. The rest of the cast also do good job. The entire film is in Latin and Aramaic but the visuals speak for itself. The Passion was snubbed from the Oscars as this is defiantly best picture material. While I did enjoy the film, I did think that they went overboard with the whipping. The film was good but there was a lack of spirituality so I don't think it will necessary convert people but it might make them think about it. There's also a lot of blood and violence in the film so its best if kids not watch this. Rating 7/10 Whether you agree with the message or not this is still a well made movie that's worth watching.",The Passion of the Christ
139,theshadow908,A realistic view into the last 12 hours of Christ's life.,7,1 March 2006,"Let me just start off by saying that this is the most engaging Jesus movie I've ever seen. It's the only movie about Jesus, besides Jesus Christ Superstar, that I can sit through and not get bored. This movie about the last 12 hours of Christ's life was surrounded by controversy because of its intense violence and gore, but to me it was probably the most realistic version of what would have happened to Jesus. A problem I have with movies that have foreign characters is that they usually aren't played like a foreign character. For instance, The Greatest Story Ever Told is about Jesus, and it stars all British actors. So, to me this movie was really refreshing because they spoke the actual language that Jesus spoke.I like how realistic this movie is to the last 12 hours of Christ's life. Some Jesus movies feature Jesus being whipped and nailed to the cross with only red marks on his back and a few trickles of blood. Now, I'm not saying I'm some sicko that would much rather watch all the torture...I mean, it was gruesome stuff. It's just that this movie shows how it probably really happened. Jim Caviezel was great as Jesus. He played the role really believably, and when he was acting in pain, he looked in pain.The big problem was Mel Gibson's direction. This movie didn't really have a lot about the message of Jesus, but only all the pain and torture he went through, which got really tedious to watch. You hear about people who were overcome with emotion, but to me it just got boring. The whipping scene and the scene of Jesus dragging his cross through town were WAY too dragged out, and I almost wanted to hit fast forward. Mel Gibson went a little crazy with that.Overall, it's a good depiction of the last hours in the life of Jesus, but Mel Gibson overdid it a little bit.6.5/10",The Passion of the Christ
140,mOVIemAN56,"Best of the Christ Films, Powerful",10,26 March 2005,"(Possible Spoilers)The Passion of the Christ is the latest, big budget film by Mel Gibson. Instead of Gibson's usual war movie (The Patriot, Braveheart, We Were Soldiers) this is a touching yet amazingly painful movie to watch. The story is probably everyone on Earth has heard, believer or not. The story of Jesus Christ.The film starts with Jesus in Gethsemane pleading with God not to die. The film moves from after the betrayal into Jerusalem to the Sanhedrin to Pontius Pilate. the film is filled with a lot of aspects that many people would not recognize. The film is mostly based of the Christian Holy Book The Bible and accounts from a 18th Century Nun named Anne Emmerich who allegedly had visions of Christ's death in great detail.The movie is exceptionally graphic yet strictly based on the Bible. The movie is not anti-Semitic at all. Caviezel is superb and in my opinion the best Christ in film history and truly shows what Christ suffered for us. The movie is in all Latin and Aramaic with subtitles but that doesn't affect the movie (I don't know if it is because I can read and speak Latin or something else). The movie is not for the faint at heart or for children (I had heard of parents dragging their eight year old kids to watch Jesus get scourged mercilessly) but if your ready for one of the most accurate movie from Book to film, then see it.The Passion of the Christ.

141,squeezebox,"Very good, though far too overly stylized",7,15 February 2006,"PASSION OF THE Christ is a very good movie. I am not a practicing Christian, but even I was moved. Jim Caviezal brought heart-breaking humanity to a larger-than-life historical character, as well as did the other actors.Though I personally do not believe that Jesus was actually the son of God, the finale of the movie was extremely powerful and uplifting, even if taken as simply allegorical (which is what i have always believed to be the case, anyway).Regardless of whether it was the director Mel Gibson's intention, I feel it portrayed Jesus as an ordinary man who refused to give up, with unprecedented levels of integrity and faith which kept him from ever caving. It is this lesson (peace, love and tolerance are principles worth dying for) that I wish people would take from this story.My only real problem with the movie is the way it's shot. Mel Gibson spends so much time setting up slick, stylish shots that he actually takes away from the tragedy and horror of what's happening. A gritty, documentary-style shooting style would have served this story better. Instead, it looks more like a John Woo action movie than the tragic story of an innocent man's unjust torture and execution.When Jesus falls repeatedly while carrying the crucifix up the mountain, the shots of him falling are all low angle and in slow-motion. I can't think of any other way to say this, but it winds up looking ""cool."" The way violence in many action movies looks ""cool."" Gibson practically romanticizes the violence, the camera moving in close for almost fetishistic looks at the ripped flesh and gushing blood. It reminded me of SALO or MEN BEHIND THE SUN, two supposedly serious movies that go so far over-the-top in depicting atrocities that they become little more than freakshows. I wouldn't be surprised to see PASSION become a cult hit with fans of movies such as CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and BLOODSUCKING FREAKS. I have a feeling that was NOT Gibson's intention.But Jim Caviezal and the other cast members save the movie. The acting is so powerful, it brings the shattering emotional turmoil to the forefront, leaving the overly stylized production and over-the-top splatter as only moderately distracting. It moved me, and not many movies these days can do that.",The Passion of the Christ

This film strikes u only if u understand that Christ suffered all these persecutions for our sins, otherwise this will be just a normal film for you.

There is no middle ground.Some may find it inspiring, some maybe moved to tears.A long career playing rebels led Mel to dramatize the last hours of the world's greatest rebel Jesus Christ utilizing the innovative technique of a rendition in the period languages with English subtitles. This must be the first movie ever performed in Latin. On Biblical faithfulness, Mel does toy with the Biblical account a bit with the ever presence of the taunting Devil whom Christ had long before Getsemene dismissed. In places there are sidestories which the writer made up. The writers however well knew their Bible and borroweed not a little from the Apochryphal Acts of Pilate.Comparable films: Jesus of Nazareth, King of Kings, The Robe.",The Passion of the Christ

The material we're dealing with here means nothing to me, but I'll hardly fault the film for that, but unless you bring your own religious baggage into this film - there is practically no content for the uninitiated. It's just some nice guy with a really good pain threshold who gets beaten to a gory pulp for a really, really long time. So on that account, the makeup fx were pulled off nicely and the flesh tearing, blood spraying sound mix was superb, but this is just an empty shell of a movie. It didn't connect with me on an emotional level, which is why I didn't find it disturbing and it just feels tiresome and monotonous.

This makes it far better than the movie by Scorcese. Anyway, Gibson's movie seems to me blatantly anti-semitic, although it could also be said to be anti-rabbinic - however, why do we have these scenes: ""Crucify Christ!"" (says the Rabbi) No, we will not crucify him (says the Romans) and so on again and again with the Romans seeming to be pro-Christ and the Jews seeming to be those responsible for the torture and execution of Christ. Moreover, Christ is called ""The Farisean"" all the time - it is like he wasn't even Jewish himself. Anyway, the movie is so excellent and wonderful that all these is excused. Probably the movie, although it seems like dynamite, is only anti-rabbinic - that is, anti-priesthood.

146,fil-nik09,Don't know really...,5,18 February 2015,"I just finished watching this movie. I was hesitant about giving it 4 or 5 but I go with five stars. Lately, I have been catching up on 'big' movies of past 10 or 20 years and this one came on the list. As a fan of horror movies, this one might scare some people more than Insidious, Sinister and Saw all chapters together - especially if you don't like blood. I do think that the scenes were beautifully done and that cinematography was mostly on point throughout the film, but ... it is just the ONLY thing that was great in this movie. And maybe the scene towards the ending when she holds Christ... the scene is totally like a work of some painter - Michelangelo came to mind. It did bothered me that Jesus' teeth were in one scene all bloody and in next quite white!!! Also that one eye was closed pretty much the whole time of suffering but in one,two short scenes not! I really like Biblical stories... but those on National geography are more interesting than this movie. If for anything, see the film because of Monica Bellucci",The Passion of the Christ
147,B24,Briefly Put,1,13 March 2004,"Despite assertions to the contrary in these many posts, this film is another example of Hollywood's avaricious, self-serving, megalomaniacal triumphs over the crystalline simplicity of Christian faith. Like ""The Robe,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""The Ten Commandments,"" etc., it substitutes sensationalism for truth, sentiment for reason, medieval pietism for sound Biblical research, and cinematic shocks for information.  The only art served here is the art of deception. In that sense, it is no more than a cartoon version of the Passion as seen through some grotesque prism, elevating human depravities to the level of divine revelation. Utterly without merit.  Except as an object lesson of what Christianity is NOT about.",The Passion of the Christ
148,Donatien3,Intense and unforgettable,9,15 February 2005,"Regardless of your opinion of the hype and controversy surrounding The Passion of the Christ, there's one thing you can't refute  it's an unforgettable cinematic experience. Mel Gibson's vision was always going to be risky, as 'The Passion' is arguably the most famed religious tale ever. But, by treating the subject with extreme reverence (including using the languages of the time, Aramic, Hebrew and Latin, and staying true to the original scriptures), Mel had created an epic which captures the suffering Jesus of Nazareth went through in the final hours of His life, which, in turn, justifies its oft-criticised violence.The journey starts in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus, aware of what's about to happen to him, prays to God, and is confronted by a hooded, asexual Satan. This is interspersed with Judas's betrayal of Jesus. After being led away by the guards, He is questioned by the leaders of the Pharisees, who accuse Him of blasphemy and condemn Him to death. Then He is lead to Pilate, who, realising He's from Galilee, palms Him off to a hedonistic Herod, who mocks Jesus. He is then returned to Pilate, who gives the crowd a choice between freeing either Jesus or murderer Barrabas. The crowd overwhelmingly chooses Barrabas. Pilate then requests for Jesus to be flogged, but not killed After the flagellation, Jesus, now almost recognisable, is crowned with thorns and given back to Pilate, who washes his hands of the situation, leaving His fate in the hands of the crowd, who demand his crucifixion. Then, a weakened Jesus is made to carry the cross up to Golgotha. Burdened by the cross' immense weight, He falls down constantly, and needs help carrying it. For the previously bloodthirsty crowd, this sight makes them realise the gravity of their decision. After reaching Golgotha, He is crucified, and a tear is shed from Heaven. The Passion of the Christ lasts for two hours, and the sheer intensity and seriousness may be tough going for some. To be honest, the violence isn't as bad as it's been made out to be. Yes, it's graphic (wounds are shown as Jesus is whipped. Blood spurts from His hands and feet as He's nailed to the cross), but enough is concealed to make it bearable. The ten-minute flagellation scene is the film's most striking, both physically and symbolically. One such example is after Jesus has been scourged by the initial whips. He slumps to the ground, but, to the amazement of all, wrenches Himself back up, ready to take more punishment. The use of flashback scenes not only give viewers some relief from the violence, but provide The Passion's main moments of symbolism and artistry. Scenes involving Jesus working on a table (the film's only moment of levity), presiding over the Last Supper, riding into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, Mary caring for a Jesus as a boy (which are both intertwined with His drawn out journey to Golgotha for maximum impact), and the Sermon on the Mount are striking in their subtlety. Jim (or James) Cavaziel is wonderful as Jesus. With little dialogue in the second half of the film, he portrays Christ's suffering visually, especially in the flagellation scene and the trek up Golgotha. In a shoot where he was struck by lightning whilst filming the crucifixion, and received a fourteen-inch scar on his back after being accidentally whipped during the flagellation, he redefines ""suffering for your art""All in all, The Passion of the Christ is an unforgettable, definitive film, which puts a new perspective on the famous Passion.",The Passion of the Christ
149,flicklover,"A very emotional, brutal film.",8,27 February 2004,"The buzz that has been created by virtually everyone surrounding this film has converted it into the EVENT movie of the new millennium. Mel Gibson has been both vilified and praised for his vision about the 12 hours before Jesus is crucified. All of the talk aboout how violent the film is made me imagine that I was going to watch a freak show. Let me say that YES, the film is very violent, but i never felt that it was gratuitous. The film is obviously the work of a man that has deep religious beliefs, Gibson has chosen to show the agony of Jesus, and at that he is effective. There are the aspects of the film that bother me though.Much has been said about Gibson's choice to show Pilate in an almost positive light, and though I don't agree that he is shown positively, he is shown to be weak, and condemns Jesus to placate the Jewish high priests. I am not an expert, but I even have studied enough to know that he was a vicious man. The Jews in the film, especially the high priests are shown to be the ones that want his death. Lets face it the jews were under Roman rule NOT the other way around!!! I DO agree that Jesus was a threat to the status quo, and the religious hierarchy felt threatened by his teachings, and though I don't believe that the film blames ALL the Jews for the Crucifixion, it irresponsibly shows Pilate as being manipulated into condemning Jesus to death. This is a film review not a theological discussion so I won't go into the more dangerous aspect of this, but all of the controversy that this film has garnered is centered around this, Gibson had to know he was playing with fire, and could have been more even handed. I don't accuse him of anything except to say that he had to know that it was a touchy subject. I do believe that as a filmmaker he should have the freedom to put on the screen what he wanted, but in this case he was insensitive and irressponsible.The film is not at all subtle , it never lets up, it is tough to take, but it is hard not to watch, just looking at it from a human point of view, it is a harrowing story. I'm not a theologian, but it is obvious that the effect the movie is going to have on the individual watching it, it may have to do with one's religion, but this is film that will certainly inspire debate, hopefully civilized. The funny thing is that most people probably walk into this film already decided about how they feel about it. I did try to have an open mind. The film is daring in the sense that it makes no bones about it's intent to inspire a reaction to it. Gibson has made a film that one experiences more than just watches. It is a visceral film, very brutal and passionate, and it will cause an emotional reaction, what kind of emotion depends on the viewer. My objections to the film do not remove the fact that it is well made and acted, it has undeniable power.Grade: B",The Passion of the Christ
150,mmunier,a film that recount the passion of Christ as it is known but in its own style.,6,16 April 2006,"I just watched the movie last night on a commercial TV chanel in Sydney. It actually was screened entirely without break or commercial on Easter Saturday, such a feat unheard from me up to this day! I did not see the film when it was at the cinemas. I have very mixed up feeling about Christianity to which i was involved with perhaps one quarter of my life and so would be something like from the age of 15 to 30. I believe many factors such as my personal relationship with this topic affects how one receives this viewing. Before coming here I read some of the comments (usually starting at the beginning till I feel I have enough... I wonder when the other comments ger read!) The first one was rather bizarre highly critical and with some unusual claims (such as the Romans should have been speaking Greek???) But many others were full of praise. I rather fell in the middle of the road. I was surprised that I did not appreciate the language with subtitles as I often see foreign films and since my hearing has declined through the years I usually welcome subtitle; I think I was influenced by the knowledge it was produced by M. Gibson and so was expecting English. I felt that the emphasis on the brutality and gore was too much. I don't believe its visual expression to a plus, i think subtle suggestion is much more powerful to express such events (in this regard I think of ""the silence of the lambs""). Was this cruelty exaggerated? I suppose it's anyone's guess but I have no doubt we're capable of such cruelty. As a youngster I remember being part of a passion play so I was surprised again but also pleased to see that the film followed the known story fairly accurately. The introduction of Satan in its original fashion was for me interesting and added some depth to this work. I did not go in trance or through excessive emotional state but rather reserved about my feelings through most of the screening. I would not say that it was one of the most memorable experience I had yet I'm glad I have seen this movie. I find that it is a worthwhile piece of work well produced. As for the critics it receives, I already stated my position in regard to the cruelty; in regard to the antisemitic what can one say? Certainly the Jews were concerned about this guy who seemed as if he was going to take over so as member of the human race they handled it to the best of their ability and knowledge. It seems at the end some did realise they'd made a terrible mistake. to recount this does not seem antisemitic to me.

I've tried to understand but I simply don't know why he wanted to show us these moments. Well, let's just accept the film as it is... and analyse it just the way it was done. I've read many people have been shocked by the violence that is shown in the story. It's really cruel and sometimes we find it hard to think Jesus suffered so much. But he did. And once Mel Gibson decided to show those last moments of Christ, I think he had to be as real as possible. And he was.The fact the film is all in Latin and Hebrew makes it even more fascinating than what we could expect before entering the movie theatre. In many parts of the film there are no subtitles, so we just hear the actors speaking one of the languages and try to guess what they mean by the expressions of the faces or moments of the bodies.

152,ExpendableMan,"Jesus Christ gets beaten up, then dies horribly",1,22 January 2007,"For all the furore surrounding the Passion of the Christ on its release, its not much of a surprise that it divided viewers. Some folks embraced it as a testimony of the love that Jesus had for his people and by witnessing the extent of his suffering it served to reinforce their beliefs or even convert them to Christianity. Others however damned the movie, calling it an anti-semitic propaganda piece filled with sneering Jewish authority figures encouraging the mutilation of mankind's saviour with evil relish and given that director Mel Gibson was caught making an anti-semitic rant while drunk last year, it's hardly surprising. But all those arguments for their own sake are ignoring one simple fact; that The Passion of the Christ just isn't a very good movie. To be honest, it's rubbish. Utter rubbish.You all know the story by now I'm sure, the last twelve hours in the life of Christ and all he went through blah blah blah purple monkey dishwasher. Its all very grand, very melodramatic (the insistence on slow motion gets irritating early on) and is packed full of moments where dust spirals into the air accompanied by big orchestral music so that we all know just how important this is, but the story has very little substance in it. Jesus, arrested by the Philistines is led into the arms of Pilate and in order to avoid a riot, the Roman senator has him tortured then crucified. That's it.What this amounts to is ultimately nothing more than two hours of Jim Caviezel being beaten horribly. The flogging and scourging scene is shocking in its brutality for the first thirty seconds, but after ten minutes you become desensitised and it loses its impact. We then get Jesus carrying the cross up the hill, which basically amounts to a sequence of him picking it up, falling over, getting whipped, and picking it up once more being repeated about a dozen times. All while leering Roman soldiers happily batter his wretched frame into mush. The level of gore is really quite shocking and despite all claims of it being a realistic portrayal, considering the Bible doesn't linger on the crucifixion that much, Gibson's decision to concentrate on gore seems crude at best. When the time comes for the nails to be hammered in, he's sure to let us see the blood spurting in dramatic arcs and one of the criminals crucified next to him even has a crow pecking at his eyes. Fun stuff.The anti-semitism meanwhile isn't as bad as you might think. Sure, the baying crowds of Jewish citizens who cheer the release of a murderer and condemn the son of God doesn't exactly paint a pleasant picture, but there's also plenty of Jewish citizens who support him, crying out for his freedom and demanding an end to the suffering. Ditto the Romans who are at turns sadistic torture machines and pitying, conflicted senators.There could have been a good movie delivered from this gesture but its buried somewhere in the buckets of blood. Had it concentrated on the full week of the events leading to the crucifixion it would have been far more satisfying as it'd allow more room for the love of God to find its way into the text. Or maybe a film about Pilate, presented as a conflicted man that finds himself being called to execute the son of God would have been far more engaging. As it is though, The Passion of the Christ is like the cast of Jackass going Biblical and the only thing to come out of it is an uneasy feeling that Jim Caviezel is going to be insufferably big headed for the rest of his career. There's an episode of South Park revolving around this film where they claim the Passion ""guilt trips you into believing."" They're right.",The Passion of the Christ
153,refresh_daemon,Painfully good,8,13 February 2007,"This is a powerful and brutally violent movie. Understandable since Mel Gibson's history of movies that he's acted in and directed all have a degree of brutality about them. This is the pinnacle.Most significantly, moviegoers should be aware that it is a single man's vision of the gospel stories. This is how Mel Gibson imagines that it happened and although it's based on the gospels, there are a lot of extra-biblical elements thrown in as well as specific interpretations taken of the story. Also, it is about the passion of the Christ and not really about much else. It's about his suffering and death. If you go in there looking for a broader picture, you're looking for the wrong picture. Although it's sprinkled with allusions to the rest of the gospels (as well as some extra-biblical musings), it's not about his life or his teachings, except as refracted through his death.That said, I do have some things against this movie. There are multiple points where there are extra-biblical unnecessaries thrown in, such as the wife of Pontius Pilate and a flashback. Satan makes an appearance in the film as well, which is literally extra-biblical, although I can understand why Mel Gibson put him there. The soundtrack is painfully overwrought. It's just plain overdone at times and I wish that it'd be quiet sometimes so I could focus on the imagery. Also, the film is sometimes just a little unnecessarily extreme, especially with the overuse of slow-motion effects and the unnecessary carcass around Judas' suicide.On the other hand, the movie did quite a few things impressively. First of all, it really didn't hold back on the suffering. True that this can be perceived as a bad thing, but I think it's particularly filmically adventurous. It reminded me a little of one of my favorite Korean movies, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, which is a brutal and violent picture about revenge.In a way, the use of stylized violence reminds me of both that film and of the Hong Kong bullet ballets of John Woo. But unlike John Woo and Park Chan-wook, the use of violence (which is not realistic, with all the slow motion effects applied to make every single painful moment echo) is more similar to the use of stillness in Das Boot. It submerges you in an environment without rest, because you're constantly seeing something so terrible (in Das Boot, it's the pain of waiting as opposed to the pain of seeing torture) that it highlights all the moments where you see something different, like the various flashbacks thrown in the midst of Jesus' persecution. It could've been anything that Mel Gibson chose to flash back to, but interestingly, Gibson chose to inject scenes that indicate Jesus' humanity and his teachings, which amplifies the disturbing nature of the crucification tortures as you see just how terrible it was for such an innocent and even righteous man to suffer like so.There has been a lot of dialogue about this film before its official release, amounting in a controversy with a lot being said, but in all truth, it's not really about this film. It's said the film is anti-Semitic. I don't agree. If you look for reasons to hate in any film about people, you will find them. This story is not about the Jews and it's not about the Romans, who are truly portrayed as terribly sadistic and subhuman. It's quite simply about Jesus and the sufferings he endured for humanity. If you watch the film with an insight into the socio-political context of the Roman Empire and the Hebrew nation at the time, it's very easy for you to read the political motivations of both the Sanhedrin and Pontius Pilate. Furthermore, if you look for Jews sympathetic to Jesus, then you'll find them. There are members of the Sanhedrin who leave angry with the made up proceedings against Jesus. There are many Jews (mostly women) who call out against the violence during Jesus' march to the hill.Is the film perfectly historically or even textually accurate? No. No film is. People loved A Beautiful Mind, but the film not only changes Nash's list story to better fit the movie format, but adds plenty of stuff into the movie to make it more filmworthy.Not that I like everything that's been added in or changed to the gospel stories. The change of the character of Pontius Pilate and the inclusion of the sympathetic wife bothers me. Sometimes the violence was really just unnecessarily excessive, such as the incident with the raven and the thief.Still, despite all the problems I have with the film, I still ended up shedding a couple tears in the process. This was even though I was my usual semi-detached film critic self. Probably because it resonated with my belief that Jesus was God and it hurt to see that it was for me and because of me he let himself die like that.I honestly think that only a small segment of the mainstream audience will really get the full impact of this film, and that's a small subsection of the Christian audience. I would've liked to see a little bit more of what he was dying for as well, since it's only implied and talked about, but not actually shown in the movie. That might have improved the film greatly.Honestly, the film is a really decent film. It is a work of artistic vision carried out to its end, almost uncensored. I think that the greatest flaw is that it failed to expose filmically what Jesus of Nazareth was dying for, because that would've given a little bit more meaning for his passion. But it's still an amazing portrait of one great passion. Still, because of the flaw, it's good, but not great. Very close. 8/10.",The Passion of the Christ
154,jpintar,Great storytelling,8,25 February 2004,"Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ is a remarkable filmmaking achievement. He successfully recreated the time of Christ in great fashion, right down to the authentic Latin and Aramenic dialouge (but wouldn't ancient Jews speak ancient Hebrew?).  The movie follows Christ from his arrest to his crucification.  The actors are very good in their respective roles.  The movie is not perfect, however.  The constant flashbacks and flash forwards are more annoying than they are effective storytelling.  The movie might have benefitted if it started at the last supper (where the passion of Christ begins in the Bible).  Despite these criticisms, the movie is an extraordinary achievement.  8/10  (Note:  I didn't find the film Anti Sematic at all.  As a progressive Catholic, I believe it was the Roman Empire who ultimately killed Christ with the help of powerful chief priests who wanted to maintain their power.)",The Passion of the Christ
155,OldAle1,"Revelling in torture, but teaching nothing of love",3,26 April 2009,"If ever there was a film that would seem to cry out for an ""objective"" review - that is, one somehow not colored by the prejudices that the viewer inevitably brings to bear on any experience of art - this is it. I've read a few reviews of the film over the past few days, and every one of them, positive or negative, states upfront something about the reviewer's religious point of view. In some ways this is quite unfortunate, as the technical and storytelling qualities of the film have been so obscured by questions of whether it is ""good"" (i.e., ""moral"") or not. So it would be really nice to be able to see a review that can cut through all the inevitable biases that people have and treat it as merely another ""film."" Fortunately or unfortunately though, Gibson makes that well-nigh impossible. We learn very little about the life of Jesus - there are perhaps a dozen flashbacks, but they are all quite brief; the film assumes flat-out that he is the son of god and that it's going to be obvious to everybody. And for all that Gibson has said about how his death was the fulfillment of his father's plan, just watching the film will tell you that the vast majority of the Jews and Romans involved took enormous delight from torturing and killing him. And there's no getting around the fact that this film was made for believers who know or care about the story. The fact, then, that I am not a believer needs to be stated, and I'm not sure how anyone would go about giving this film any kind of cogent review without his or her own attitudes about Christianity coming into play.So if the film isn't really about Jesus' teachings, then what is it? It's a film of death, of course. There's been a lot of exaggeration about the violence in the film; this I suspect plays into the politics of both ""sides"" - the conservative Christians who want to exaggerate the bloodshed to make their cause more righteous, and the Jewish and other critics who want to make the film out to be more anti-semitic, more unpleasant than it actually is. Roger Ebert claims that about 100 of the 126 minutes in the film are ""concerned specifically and graphically with the details of the torture and death of Jesus."" This is a gross overstatement: the first torture sequence doesn't begin until 53 minutes into the film. Sure Jesus is mistreated up to this point, but it's certainly less definable as torture than waterboarding. This first segment is about the betrayal by and eventual suicide of Judas, the ""trial"" (very brief, and telling us little) by his own people, the vacillation by Pilate over whether to give in to the Jewish leaders and have him killed, etc. Only near the hour mark does the slow-motion scourging and bloodletting begin, and there are many breaks in the rest of the film for flashbacks - which, again, don't give us much of a real sense as to why Jesus was different or special, in an age when there were plenty of heretics and madmen to go around. Gibson expects us all to just accept it.It's not as bloody then as advertised by some, though it does approach the level of some horror films in terms of total violence I suppose. The film is rather ugly for the most part - some of the day scenes are nicely shot, and the final moments are quite beautiful and cinematic, poetic even, but most of the time the colors are washed out or perhaps filtered - the early night scene in Gethsemene is all blues, the rest of the film is mostly dirty and brown. I guess this is Gibson's idea of realism - grubby photography to make the massive gouts of blood stand out in high relief. And slow-motion! This is how we know that Jesus' blood being spilled is of greater import than our own, I guess. Slow-mo everywhere! The music isn't bad, but it is awfully reminiscent in parts of Peter Gabriel's score for ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", up until the last half hour when it starts to sound more like traditional swelling large-scale Hollywood orchestral stuff from the golden age of the Biblical film.The acting, too, I can't really call ""good"" in the conventional sense; as Gibson wants the film to look ugly, so too he seems to want the people to be ugly in appearance and deed (most everybody, but especially the Jewish leaders and the common Roman soldiers), or noble, beautiful, and suffering (Jesus and Mary Magdalene played by Monica Bellucci of all people, in particular). Maria Morgenstern as Mary mother of Jesus has the same fixed look on her face throughout the whole movie; she just as well could have been played by a mannequin. Is that acting? And James Caviezel mostly has to look sad and near-to-death from his wounds. That's about it. The few flashbacks show him smiling but serious as very brief snippets of his philosophy are expounded. Ho hum. The Romans apart from Pilate and his wife, and the majority of the Jews (basically all of those who aren't Jesus' followers or family) are presented as blood-lusting savages, but does this make the film more anti-semitic or anti-Roman? I think the point really is Christ as victim, and by implication Christians as victims - the whole world is an evil cesspool, with only the teachings of and belief in this one guy to lead us out. I guess that's very appealing to people, which is very, very sad to me. Gibson's view of the world is pretty awful, and however much he occasionally backpedals he's made it pretty clear over the past decade that he's a man of deep prejudices and hatreds. I don't know why people so much enjoyed seeing them on the screen.",The Passion of the Christ
156,dk77dk,Surprisingly Brilliant,10,1 February 2021,"You don't have to be religious to appreciate this film. I put off watching this movie for a long time before finally deciding to watch it without prejudice. I was surprised how easily the film took the viewer on a difficult and sometimes brutal journey through this truly impressive film experience. I have to admit I was swept away with Jim Caviezel's amazing performance, every time he appeared on screen he would be simply mesmerizing. I was completely unprepared for the brutal and realistic scenes, but I guess such cruelty was part of that time. The very description of that time and people seemed realistic and only reinforced the whole impression of this truly surprisingly fascinating film.",The Passion of the Christ
157,cinephile-27690,A great cinematic portrayal of God's love.,10,11 January 2019,"I wrote this review back in May, but re-reading it I realized that it needed to be re-done. That goes for many reviews I will be writing for a while.My parents were very religious, and I was sheltered from many things like Titanic(for nudity), Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings(for witchcraft), and other movies with content they felt God would not want me to see.The Passion of the Christ came out on February 25th, 2004, so I was 5 1/2 when this released. My parents went to the theater to see it and left my sister and me at home with a babysitter. When they came home, I asked them if I could see the movie when it came out to DVD and they immediately in unison responded with ""NO!""I was a bit shocked. I watched a lot of Veggie Tales growing up, how could this be any different?(Or say, from seeing The Prince of Egypt or The Jesus Film from 1979 or The Greatest Story Ever Told?)For the next 9 years, I would ask people about their thoughts on the movie and for some information on what is in the movie. That was hard to get out of my mother, who would tear up and seem depressed just from me simply saying the movie title.Finally, at age 14, I went to live with my Grandma, and she had the movie on DVD.(It used to belong to my mother, who never watched her DVD due to her memory of seeing it in theaters.)Grandma told me, after a speech about me being older, that I could see most R Rated movies, granted the profanity and nudity is not overdone.(The Wolf of Wall Street ended up being the line crosser 2 years later.)Since she had this, I watched it one day and I was in awe.I mentioned wondering how different The Passion of the Christ could be from Veggie Tales or other Bible movies I was accustomed to. The answer was this: VERY.While I was prepared for an ear cut off(see Matthew 26:51), nailing, and other things you read in the Gospels or hear at Easter, I was NOT prepared for: flaying, the crow scene(though in context it made me chuckle in all honesty),blood(lots and lots of blood!), whipping, and much more. Even film critic Roger Ebert said in his review that it was the most violent movie he had ever seen! I saw this at age 14, that would be my age limit to see this!Nothing I could write could fully prepare you for what you will see, but here is an example, and it's my favorite scene(I'll explain why in a moment):When the Pharisees tell Pilate to put Jesus to death, he is reluctant,and he orders that he should be simply flogged. Jesus is cuffed to a pole, and they give him a few standard beatings. A commanding officer stops this very shortly and asks that another weapon be used. A flogger shows this weapon with spikes on it and the CO says ""no"" and points to another weapon.This weapon is formally known as a ""cat-o-nine tails"", which has 9 HOOKS at the end of it. They flog Him with this for a much longer time, and they all laugh as He screams and as His blood splatters on their faces. Onscreen, we see His skin tear up and fly across the screen, while soldiers manically laugh at His misfortune. They are stopped when a solider walks in and sees they have gone too far.What I have just described condenses roughly 13 minutes of the movie!This was very shocking for me to see, and I was not expecting it at all.(There is a shot of the cat-o-nine tails gets stuck in His skin and yanks back. Every time I see that shot, I yank my head back in shock, even when I know it's coming.)So why is this my favorite scene? Because it does the best job showing what our Savior did for us:""But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.""-Romans 5:8.Jesus endured His suffering to show us His love for mankind. It was His mission, as shown in John 3:16. And that scene shows it the most beautifully.And that goes for the whole movie as well. Before I had seen this, I had never realized what Jesus went through to save us from Satan, and I was so appreciative of it afterwards. (Later, I saw The Last Temptation of Christ and despite being fictional, THAT makes me love Jesus more than I ever had. Please see my review for that.)Is this movie for everyone? Hmmm...I highly recommend it to everyone, though if blood will make you ill, or you are worried about trauma from seeing this...then maybe not. Otherwise, yes-see this movie. Your perspective on Good Friday will be changed forever.I adore this movie-I have actually estimated seeing this about 14 times in the last 5 years as of now! This shows how much Jesus loves us, and we should show how much we love Him every day in our lives! Praise God for that!PS, this was controversial for being anti-Jewish, since the Jewish councils are the ""villains"" and they killed Jesus. This is not true. That's bibically accurate, and we ALL killed Jesus through the sins we have committed. The Jews are not to blame. We are ALL to blame for what Jesus endured.And also: Jesus was Jewish as well-just thought you'd like to know!",The Passion of the Christ
158,geminiredblue,An Act of Faith,10,26 April 2011,"Watching Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE Christ isn't so much a viewing experience as an act of faith. When the movie came out, everyone wondered what Mel would cover in Jesus' life. Would it show him walking on water, or turning water into wine? The fact of the matter is that Mel has chosen to focus solely on the last 12 hours of Christ's life. From a cinematographer's viewpoint, this movie is beautifully shot and edited, with a good portion of the movie shown in various speeds of slow-motion to add effect. The violence of the scourging and Crucifixion is some of the most realistic ever portrayed, and is even harder to watch. Unlike so many movies where violence is put there for titillation and thrills, there is nothing thrilling about the violence depicted in this film. Literally, we are shown every second of agony that the Lord endured. What this movie hammers home (forgive the turn of phrase) is the completion of Jesus' life and mission here on earth. What we're left with in the end is a glorious tale about Christ's love for all humanity, and his triumph over evil and death. I wouldn't be so surprised if this is how the events took place in real life. The impact of this film has been felt throughout the world. Many aimless, wandering former Christians re-dedicated themselves to their faith upon seeing this movie. I myself rediscovered my Catholic faith after watching this. I would highly recommend this movie to any fellow Christians who are losing their faith, as well as anyone who wants to become a Christian.",The Passion of the Christ

It's a film that will definitely move you, but should never be introduced to the faint-hearted.Mel Gibson's and Jim Caviezel's efforts within their roles of direction and performance are very persuasive. And what's loveable about the entire film is how painful, breathtaking and lifelike it is. The Passion of the Christ is exactly what you'd expect from a flawlessly-designed masterpiece; moving, uplifting, stunning and owning a very strong sense of power. However, the let-down of it all is its significant but dragging pace. It truly could've been better if it were a little bit faster.The depiction of the brutality is also very effective, but is hugely tough to witness. The fact that Jesus went through scourging and the entire process of crucifixion for the forgiveness of our sins will attach to the audience.

This movie was absolutely beautiful, brutal, mesmerizing and the experience I had while watching it will never be forgotten. I am not a religious person but I have never cried so much during a movie, it was like watching a beloved friend die. James Caviezel was ravishing in his role as Jesus Christ and the whole cast was purely breathtaking. The Soundtrack was also haunting and fantastic.

It is innovative, well made and wonderfully cast. The film aesthetic is beautiful, overall Mr Gibson did a wonderful job.I realise this film was unpopular in some quarters of the Christian world as the Jewish, but this film is without question the most original of all the mainstream religious movies ever made.I have read some reviews here labeling it as being too Roman or anti-Semitic, all of which is nonsense. You can find want you want in anything, but Mr Gibson didn't make this film with a pro-catholic/anti-Semitic agenda in mind. All previous mainstream movie representations of Jesus have been tame, but here the director clearly wanted a grittier more realistic take on the subject.Come to this film unbound by preconception if you can and you will enjoy it.",The Passion of the Christ
162,The_Core,Sickening violence.,3,25 January 2005,"Yep, that's about all I got out of this. The characterizations were shallow and undeveloped, the portrayal of Satan was silly, and the screenplay basically nonexistent. This was a 2-hour blood-and-gore-fest, and I'm not surprised that people enjoy it. They liked watching crucifixions back then, and it's no surprise whatsoever that people still like it. If it had been a real scourge and crucifixion (i.e. a snuff film) that somehow managed to sneak by the MPAA, I think it would have done three times as well at the box office.Did I enjoy this movie? No. It made me sick to my stomach, and I can only hope that the majority of viewers had the same reaction. Somehow though, I suspect my reaction to be in the minority.

163,galileo3,"""An excruciatingly graphic and relentlessly brutal, harrowing masterpiece""",9,1 July 2007,"The Passion of the Christ. (2004)Top 2 - 2004Top 2 - Religious Film of all time Mel Gibson's film detailing Christ's final hours, has experienced extensive controversy and was sometimes accused of Anti-Semitism. The Passion is a harrowing and relentless film that is difficult to watch due to emotional intensity, brutality and extremely graphic violence. Certainly not an easy film to watch, The Passion of the Christ does not focus on Jesus' teachings and wisdom, but rather on the visceral, blood drenched, whipping, flaying, graphic, torturous journey of Christ in his last hours until the crucifixion (which is explicit). For portraying Jesus' pain and suffering, Gibson does his job, but it is very uncomfortable to watch.It is a very good visualisation of Christ's suffering for the betterment of humanity. Gibson's work is very impressive and the style of the film is unique.While I agree that the violence and gore is in some respect excessive, I do not see this film as a sadistic one made for the purpose of displaying disturbing sequences of violence. Gibson uses violence as his tool to drive the emotions. What happened was real. Gibson attempted to re-capture what it must have been like for Jesus. Some people will not be able to survive this film; I understand that; some will be beaten by the violence. For me this film was a powerful, physical, gripping journey; it made me feel the pain of one man; witnessing the evils committed by man on his own species.Mel Gibson should receive praise for his achievements. This is a piece of art, a cinematic masterpiece, a unique film that will either have you emotionally drenched or beaten down by the terrible things you witness. A shockingly powerful, artistically dramatic piece of cinema. 10/10",The Passion of the Christ
164,higherall7,The Passion of Mankind as Shockarama!,8,4 January 2013,"'The Passion of the Christ' has only one flaw to my mind, but it's a fundamental one that strikes to the heart of the controversy about the film. That is the title. This is not, to my mind, the passion of Christ. It is most certainly, however, the passion of Mankind. When you think of all the good things that are attributed to Jesus Christ and how he has worked his influence throughout the Time and Space of this planet for at least over two millenniums in prophecy, history and the spiritual evolution of humanity, he comes across as a being most worthy of consideration and study. Leave it to us humans to focus first and foremost on the most painful aspects of his sojourn with us. Because, of course, for many of us it is the pain he went through for us that most identifies him with us.This is actually very conspicuous in other ways. Have you ever noticed that when the birthday of Christ comes around nobody ever talks about what they're planning to give him? The other thing is when someone expires. Have you ever noticed that all of sudden he or she is this paragon of virtue that never did anything wrong in their lives? Also, people will normally focus on the good times they experienced with the dearly departed and downplay or forgo altogether the difficulties they may have met with said individual.Paradoxically, with Jesus Christ we do the exact opposite. When Christmas comes around it's all about us and when Easter comes around all the religiously minded can remember is the gruesome way he died and how he rose above it. No use denying that The Man from Nazareth saw us dead to rights.Evidently it is painful to be a human from start to finish and for many a cause for continual weeping in between. No amount of healing the lame and the sick and the blind or even raising up the dead can disguise this fact. Even making sure everybody has plenty to eat when the rations of loaves and fishes appear low is just a side note to the major event. Christ knew we would never be satisfied until he served himself up as the main course along with his blood as a refreshing beverage. This was one thing Kazantzakis observed correctly. We long to 'fill our soul with flesh, and to fill our flesh with soul'.No one is given over to meditate on how a man who never led an army, never ran for political office, never wrote a book and not particularly descended from royalty or a family of high financial standing nonetheless has produced such a profound and lasting effect on human society as to divide it into periods before his coming and after his coming. A man who, by the way, according to traditional standards of material success, died a total failure, when betrayed by one disciple and deserted by all the others, was forced to face a kangaroo court of the spiritually educated elite stewing in the corruption of their public relations and condemned to die an object of ridicule before his family and closest friends all for the entertainment and spectacle of Roman citizens. After that, he is buried in another man's tomb because he couldn't afford one of his own.The supreme irony of this incredible event is so difficult for the mind to grasp that the mind normally does not even attempt to do so.Mel Gibson is a great actor and a great director. But his mindset is to a great extent the product of the cultural conditioning of Hollywood. Cinema is still a young medium, barely a hundred years old, but anyone can see that across the generations there has been more and more emphasis on the body values of Sex and Violence. Although, 'The Passion of the Christ' has many independent features of interest, what Mel Gibson has done is turn up the volume on the violence until it produces a kind of visual deafness. Naturally, many members of the audience leave the theater in a state of shock or trauma. Gibson's rendering of the crucifixion may be hauntingly close to the actual event, but is the catharsis fulfilling enough that you really want to go through all this a second time? Your answer to this question is a Rorschach test in blood of the amount of pain and suffering you have endured in your life. Now years before this, Martin Scorsese did a very faithful version of Nikos Kazantzakis' 'The Last Temptation of Christ'. The fault did not really lie with Scorsese, but rather with Kazantzakis' rehashing of the Gospels to the point of blasphemy as some see it, and then considering a different ending to the matter of the Crucifixion a la Ambrose Bierce before showing Christ completing his Divine Mission. Kazantzakis could have gone straight for the three days in the tomb when Christ supposedly visited Hell and many other places where beings with bodies cannot go. Since little is written about this period, he could have let his imagination run wild here and not offended many.We tend to imagine Christ as he would be in our shoes, rather than imagining what it would be like to be a Godly being to whom the past, present and future are ever present in one simultaneous flash and the miracles of Faith as commonplace as our daily bread. What a hardship it must be for one who can be everyone and everything always to assume the measly portion of one body for thirty-three years! Finally, what did he see in us that convinced him we were worth this trial of pain and redemption?These are issues Mel Gibson does not begin to address as he turns the body of Christ into a Jackson Pollock painting.",The Passion of the Christ
165,tccandler,A Masterful Visualization of Belief...,10,25 February 2004,"First, let me say that I think it is a shame that this great film will be used in agenda-pushing by both proponents and opponents of its content and message. Many of the extreme right-wing Christian conservatives will use the film to fuel their fires, and some in the Jewish community will use the film to bolster their fears of worldwide anti-Semitism. Both groups will be equally misguided in their rhetoric and motivations.Can't we all just remember that this is a film... only a film? 'The Passion of the Christ' is Mel Gibson's version of his faith-based historical beliefs, and it doesn't necessarily need to be any more than that. Most of us fall somewhere between the two extremes and, hopefully, in that group, this film will find a reasonable and open minded audience that can appreciate this work as art.However, it is inevitable that people's beliefs will guide their opinion of this film. Most of those that believe this is all historical fact will love 'The Passion'. Most of those that think this is either folly or a twisting of truth will not. Perhaps, only those who can remove themselves from religious bias will be able to look at 'The Passion of the Christ' with an honest eye toward artistic and cinematic appreciation. Granted, that is a tremendously hard thing to do. But if you can muster that state of mind, I think you will discover a truly masterful film about a factual/fictional/symbolic man (depending on your point of view) who sacrifices himself, in the most unselfish of ways, for the benefit of mankind. In that sacrifice, lies a poetic profundity that serves as a magnificent story, a magnificent lesson, and a magnificent film... but just a film.In the spirit of honesty, I must declare that, although I believe in a higher power, I am not a particularly religious person. I don't go to Church, I very rarely pray, and I definitely don't feel the need to impose my views on anyone else. But because of the nature of Mel Gibson's work, I feel it is necessary for readers of this review to be aware of my liberal stance on religion. I believe in the ideal of 'To each his own'.With all that being said, I think it is important to note that, among reasonably open-minded people, your beliefs shouldn't really affect your admiration, or lack thereof, toward this motion picture.I believe a great film should possess most, if not all, of the following -- Originality, Focus, Passion, Heart, Intelligence & Wit... all framed by magnificent acting, sure-handed & inspired directing, gorgeous cinematography and a beautiful score. Pulitzer Prize winning film critic, Roger Ebert, claims that ""a film should not be judged on what it is about, but how it is about it.""With those guidelines in mind, I believe that Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ' is a masterful visualization of his beliefs regarding the central moments of the Christian/Catholic religion. Those final twelve hours of Jesus' life are vividly realized in ways that many people, even devout believers, have never fully contemplated. Most Christian images have been sanitized for mass marketing over the centuries. To have the gruesome details brought back into light will shock many of those who are used to the 'greeting card Jesus' that they are so accustomed to.This film is one of the most graphically violent you will ever see... and it needs to be. If you believe the gospel to be literal truth, as does Gibson, there needs to be an honest depiction of the horrific events that led up to and were manifested in the crucifixion. To recount those moments in this review would diminish their impact. The beating, whipping and scourging of Jesus is gut-wrenching stuff to watch. Mel Gibson's lens never turns away. He wants you to see all the suffering. He wants to convey, in the clearest possible sense, the vicious nature of this moment and the depths of man's inhumanity to man. This film offers no relief until the final fifteen seconds, when we see the first few moments of Jesus' resurrection.This is an unrelenting film that challenges the viewer. How often can you say that about a film? It transcends the medium. It is a film that can make 'entertainment cinema' seem so astonishingly inconsequential. Its power can make so many other things in our daily lives seem inconsequential. This film demands a certain reverence, even from non-believers or casual believers like me. I found it odd that, during my screening, a number of people brought in tubs of popcorn and giant red slurpee drinks to feast on. This just doesn't feel like that kind of film to me. I think it deserves a little more respect than regular movies... a little more humility.As for the claims of anti-Semitism, I think they are unwarranted. However, I also understand that if one approaches this film looking for anti-Semitism, you can probably find it. Biases will determine what you see or don't see in a film like this. I agree with Roger Ebert who wrote in his review, ""My own feeling is that Gibson's film is not anti-Semitic, but reflects a range of behavior on the part of its Jewish characters, on balance favorably. The Jews who seem to desire Jesus' death are in the priesthood, and have political as well as theological reasons for acting. The other Jews seen in the film are viewed positively; Simon helps Jesus to carry the cross, Veronica brings a cloth to wipe his face, Jews in the crowd cry out against his torture.""I think ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a masterpiece. It is a great film about a profound subject, shown with astonishing clarity and unnerving conviction by Mel Gibson, who has now fashioned two of the greatest films that I have ever seen, the other being 'Braveheart'. It took a lot of guts to decide to make this film, even more to finance it himself. There are very few in Hollywood who will ever display the courage to venture beyond the next comfortable project. But Gibson wrapped himself in that conviction and surrounded himself with a tremendous cast who were willing to take this precarious journey with him. Jim Caviezel assumes the impossible task of portraying Jesus, but he does it with steely determination and unflinching emotional control. Maia Morgenstern is heartbreaking as Mary. When her sad eyes watch, as her son endures the inhumanity, we feel her pain viscerally. When she cries, we cry. Monica Bellucci is equally devastating to watch as Mary Magdalene, who remains loyal to Jesus to the end. And the supporting cast are all tremendously dedicated to delivering Gibson's vision to the silver screen.This film is a collective effort of brave artists who risked more than we will fully appreciate. I commend all involved in the making of this transcendent motion picture. It is a profound work of art that deserves more than the petty controversies it will stir up. However, as time passes, both ends of the extremist argument will reflect as utter inconsequentiality when mirrored with Gibson's masterwork. Some films exist on a plain aside from all the other clutter. 'The Passion of the Christ' is assuredly one of those films.

167,fjhuerta-2,Jesus as a man.,7,12 April 2004,"If there's one thing I won't soon ever forget about this movie is the way it protrays Jesus as a man.There are so many movies out there portraying him as someone who is simply standing high above all of us, with very little suffering on his part, while acting condescending with the rest of mankind. This is not a Jesus mankind could love.This Jesus, though, is full of love, passion, fear... and is moved by his feelings and his ultimate destiny. It's a brutal portrayal of a man who gave his life because of love.Is it anti-semite? No, it is not. Unless you consider ""Schindler's list"" to be anti-germanic...As it is, it's the definitive statement of Jesus' last 12 hours, and a cinematic triumph. I can't see how a movie like this could have been made inside of the usual Hollywood we all know and love / hate.",The Passion of the Christ
168,drunken_munki,Honest and brutal,10,19 October 2020,"This title is the last of 8 items that hits my 10/10 score. It does so easily because it dares to exist. Mel Gibson is a genius for attempting something so bold and polarising. But that is the crux of the matter isn't it.This movie is polarising because there is so much evil in the world, a movie about the message and word of Christ is seen as an affront to cinema. Nay, an affront on people's sensibilities. Nay, it is an affront on everyone's way of life with their sin and intolerance, hypocrisy and guilt.This is an important movie because it dared to go there, and portrayed the crucifixion of Jesus in brutal honesty. This movie made me weep with how dark and evil the events are. And yet it is balanced out by the love in the world, from Jesus' mother. And from Mary. From the peoples and multitudes who dared to listen to him.This is one of the most important stories ever told, and done in a haunting and careful way. Jim Caviezel is mesmerising. Everything about this movie is perfectly shot and presented. The story moves on, and it even has supernatural elements woven into it with a subtle mastery.As a period piece, set in a foriegn land, it is well crafted. The settings are beautiful, the acting is superb. Everything about this is well made and haunting to see what happens after the betrayal.I honestly understand perfectly why so many despise this film. You are weak. The movie doesn't follow your version of events, or it pokes holes in your tower of cards that you build your morals on top of; or even worse it challenges your world view. Boo hoo, rate it 1/10 because you have no idea what you are seeing, do you? From a cinematic perspective it is faultless.Those who are atheists or satanists, who complain about the topic of the movie. I mean... you watch science fiction don't you? Why can't you just interpret it as sci-fi and be done with it. In any case it seems a lot of Jews and Christians were offended as well. That seems farcical.This deserves the highest score I can give it.",The Passion of the Christ
169,manendra-lodhi,"""Blood and pains of Jesus. No substance.""",5,29 October 2012,"The film depicts the last days of Jesus Christ, when he was caught and trialed. The film in the starting itself looks to be obscure with too many characters with which we could not relate. Jesus is in pain from the starting moment. What you are going to see for the entire 2 hours is how brutally one can be punished. Entire body of his turning red due to the beatings is what the film is about. The screenplay was very poor. The concept was nice. Exploring the last days of Jesus is a great idea. But the film completely fails to impress because the filmmakers were more interested in showing how Jesus was punished.PROS:The idea is good. The acting by the man depicting Jesus Christ was good. The cinematography too was good considering the fact that a lot of blood had to be shown. Other than that the screenplay is a big letdown.CONS:When I read about the synopsis I thought that the film would give a proper insight about the people with whom Jesus had lived in his end days. Instead, the whole focus was on the brutality and incompetency of the authorities. Never for a moment, had I felt that there was a move to explain some characters. I don't understand what Mel Gibson wanted the audience to feel. Is it that the man in those times was so brutal or that Jesus had so much strength to drag his blood stained boy. The point I thought would have been to sympathize with Jesus or the people who loved him. But finishing the film, one feels only hatred towards the people who committed such crimes. The motive of the film was not this I suppose.VERDICT: ""Watch at your risk.""",The Passion of the Christ
170,jacksflicks,Obscene,1,17 March 2004,"This is nothing but just another Mel Gibson-as-mutilatee S&M orgy.  It's the ultimate snuff film that Gibson has been working up to, beginning with eating-his-gun Gibson in Lethal Weapon, graduating to evisceration-Gibson in Braveheart and top-to-bottom-mutilation-Gibson  in Payback.  Apparently it's ""Lord I am not worthy"" for ""Passion,"" so for flayed-alive-and-crucified-Gibson we have a stand-in.The brigade of the ""Christian righteous,"" who have obviously stuffed the ballot box here, are turned on by having their own sick, repressed road-kill fetish disguised as a socially acceptable religious fetish.  That's the ""Passion"" part.  The same ""Passion"" of the Christ as the ""Passion"" of Husayn, the founding martyr of Shi'a Islam (the Islam of Iranians and Iraqis), whose followers regard self-mutilation is a devotional.  Of course, Christians had the same idea about devotionals in the dark ages, but have crawled out of that miasma.Except those who practice Gibson's brand of Catholicism, as advertized in his ""Passion"".  The brand which, along with Southern Baptists and other apocalyptics, preaches through threat, intimidation, anathema, and hell-fire and brimstone.  This of course is only one brand of Christianity, as human bombs are only one brand of Islam.This Gibson obscenity masquerading as sacred myth (or worse yet, sacred history) threatens to become the biggest grosser (pun intended) in history, surpassing even that mass snuff film Titanic.

171,willrams,Incomparable,7,7 March 2004,"A film such as this is hard to review considering the subject matter of Jesus Christ because religious faith in his teachings abound in so many directions, and because I do not wish to offend anyone.  Even my own pastor talked about this today by saying, each person has to make up their own mind whether to see it or not.  In my own mind, I do not believe Mel Gibson who directed this film, meant for it to be exploited by too many self-righteous religious groups. I found the movie much too strong on the gory side.  How the Romans killed and brutalized Jesus; even found myself shedding a tear.  There was so much blood and prolonged dying sequence.  The music and passion singing were terrific, and the film is in Assyrian and Greek languages with English subtitles.  One good thing was the way Mr Gibson used references to the Biblical quotations, in English, to the various scenes presented.  The acting is superb with James Caviezel playing the role of Jesus, Monica Bellucci plays Mary Magdalene, mother Mary is played by Maria Morgenstern, and Judas is played by Luca Lionello.  8/10",The Passion of the Christ
172,son_of_cheese_messiah,So so biblical retelling,5,28 April 2011,"I had no real intention of seeing this until I happened to watch the excellent Apocalypto, which caused me to revise my view of Mel Gibson considerably. My main reasons for not watching this previously were twofold, the excessive hype, which always causes me to avoid something on principle and the subtitles, which I generally find distracting, although their use in Apocalypto was so good I barely noticed them.This film is an inferior work, although I guess Gibson learnt a lot in making it. The arrest of Christ in the garden of Gethsemane is one of the most dramatic incidents in the Bible, or indeed all literature. That drama is not well captured here, with meandering shots, distracting edits and pointless slow motion sequences. This is the bible for the MTV generation.These faults pervade the entire film which struggles to get going even with its powerful and timeless source material. Everything is shot in a dark gloom, somewhat tiresomely after a while and the music is generic sounding Middle Eastern moaning which could come from any film. The flashbacks do not help the forward momentum either.I'm very familiar with the Passion story but I would guess that the uninitiated would find this confusing since little or no character introductions are made.",The Passion of the Christ

From the opening scene of Jesus accompanied with his disciples right the way through to his resurrection the film never holds it's breath to let go and give you a full on moving movie experience. Praise to Mel Gibson who has transported audiences back to a time of sheer brutality and anger. Although The Passion of the Christ is subtitled in Aramaic, but don't let this put you off. Do beware thought that this film is incredibly violent throughout and nothing is cut out from Jesuses intense ten-minute beating scene through to the climatic crucifixion. The story is also haunting and visually stunning and provides a depth of fear and anxiety to give people the edge and stability to look further into the complex characters.Finally, a must watch for any movie goer.

The other film, which I will not mention is a true story as well. This was unlike any and all of the other 'Jesus' movies I have seen. No wonder, so many wept and cried even upon walking out of the movie. The story is the greatest love story ever known. I am grateful to Mel Gibson, even in these times he has had recently, for his courage and unstoppable drive to bring this beautiful creation to the big screen. With all the odds he faced in Hollywood with companies not backing him up and not wanting anything to do with the distribution of this Epic film.He defied those odds, the problems that would be the biggest in front of him. I know he had help too. I saw in the detailed definition of the story, not just a production and actors in a Bible movie like the ones past, but a real depiction, it's what I would and could imagine it to be. The Jesus's in the other movies, at the end of the Cruxcifixion scenes, didn't seem as though they had been through what Jesus had been. They where dirty or even in a 1950s or early 60s movie that I remember that was on T.V. that ' Jesus' was clean and looked like he was merely out of breath. Nothing like this was. Jim in character looked like he had been reduced to raw meat, all over his body. I was shocked!! It was amazing. I was warn out at the end of the crucifixion, when the view widened passed the cross, the breeze was almost non existent . I remember people leaving the theater in tears still, some crying, some hugging each other, some women left their own purses behind accidentally, forgetting due to the striking content of the film. No one I knew was eating anything while in the theater, I never saw a person with a snack, or drink. I do remember the power of the 'i m p a c t' in full though. No wonder it made the 'Box-Office' receipts that it did. But more than that, it's an irrefutable true story, many have tried to prove it untrue, but someday Satan will sing the blues. Or scream them.

Even my Grandma who as far as know is very religious and attends mass every Sunday to pray for us all to Jesus did not seem to enjoy it after all as if she never realized what the truth was all about or simply could not handle it or deal with it. What Gibson wanted here was for us to feel more than anything else, and therefore I believe this film to be a great success. It only depicts the most important part of the whole story, those last few hours. You can tell its the same director of Braveheart if you compare them closely.",The Passion of the Christ
176,ArizWldcat,"Powerful, moving, emotionally draining",10,28 February 2004,"It is very difficult to write a review of this movie because it affected me on such a personal level.  Those who have written negative reviews obviously have an intense hatred of Christians.  It makes me wonder why they bothered seeing this movie.  It's not as if they didn't know the subject matter. Some have obviously strained to find something negative to say.  Others are blatantly trying to inflame.  Yes, it is a violent movie.  Yes, lots of people (myself included)cried their eyes out.  You see, most of us who cried realize that WE did this to Jesus. (it's not about blaming others...read the gospels!!) It was OUR iniquity (thus the quote from Isaiah at the beginning of the film) that did this to Him.  He had to do this because he loved us.  I know lots of agnostic/atheist/others who disdain fundamentalists Christians are smirking at this. I hope you would respect our faith as you seem to respect the faith of others who are not Christians.  As for antisemitism, I didn't see it. Lots of characters are portrayed as evil.  Did you expect Mel and the other writer to change the gospel?  To us they are sacred documents.  If you want blasphemy, there are plenty of other movies that you can see.If you are familiar with the New Testament (particularly Romans and Hebrews) you know that Israelites are still God's chosen people, and we as Christians are to honor that and pray for them.  It's a pity many in  Christendom (especially in the past) missed that point, but to ask that we don't remember what Jesus did for us is just ridiculous.I took my teenage daughters to see this with a little trepidation, but they handled it well and it was a good springboard for discussion.  I wouldn't take anyone under 13, however. I would definitely recommend parental accompaniment to the film for teens.To those who say this is the most violent movie you've ever seen, I doubt that.  There are many sick gross movies out there.  This I didn't find extraordinarily sick or gross because for one, I have been a believer for many years and have ""head knowledge"" about crucifixion and how violent, cruel and sadistic it was.  In other words, yes, this was sadistic...but again, do you want the gospels rewritten to please you?  I do admit there was probably some artistic license taken here, but for the most part, this was true to the gospel that I love.I hope that those who are so ready to criticize this will see it for themselves.",The Passion of the Christ

It is also very grotesque and bloody (which leaves me scratching my head why parents decide to bring their under-age kids to the movie).  It is a very good film, indeed.  I liked it. However, I have but one complaint.  The film is very gory.  The intense gore could've been brought down to a PG-13 (""Lord of the Rings"" type gore) and still give audiences the notion that Jesus died a gruesome death.  A better film would be ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" starring Max Von Sydow as Jesus.  Still, the film was wonderful in telling how Christ suffered for us.

It is true everything what the reviewers say about it: It is a powerful, inspiring, and absolutely heartbreaking film. it is easily one of the best films ever made, and it deserves more recognition.This film is quite intense, but I do believe that teens and children should see this, because it shows how Jesus our Savior died for our sins, and it shows all the love of God for mankind. It is also true that this film turn the viewers into better Christians and better human beings.

180,ilovedolby,Unlike anything I have ever seen!,10,2 March 2004,"Mel Gibson's long awaited `The Passion of the Christ' is a monumental achievement in not only filmmaking, but also in allowing its audience to be swept away by the emotional impact of the story. However, it is understandable why many people would disregard the film's message because of its brutal violence-in fact, this was my belief after I had watched only a few scenes before a full screening. The fact of the matter is that violence shows the reality behind what not only Jesus of Nazareth would have endured, but any condemned person of the time. 	`The Passion of the Christ' focuses on the last twelve hours of Christ's life, from his arrest to his crucifixion. As the film opens, we find Jesus fighting off fear of his task and ultimately defying the temptation of Satan. This scene is amazing for its dark blue color, giving the audience a spine-tingling notion of Christ's internal pain-it is as if he wrestles with fear in his own dark world. 	We are then introduced to Jesus' mother Mary (Maia Morgenstern) and Magdalene (Monica Bellucci). They witness the scourging and beating of Jesus and the actresses' performances reflect an emotion that is flooring to an audience. Morgenstern appears hardened and solemn at the sight of her son's torture. She knows what he has to endure; she cannot stand to bear it, but realizes that it cannot be stopped. We watch as solitary tears roll down her pain-stricken face. Bellucci is equally amazing to watch as she breaks down. She often finds herself holding Mary in comfort for both of their sakes, as if they are the only ones who can feel his pain. 	James Caviezel, an actor who can do little wrong, provides a remarkable performance of Jesus-especially with his eyes. In one particular scene, where Mary goes to him, he looks into her face and says `You see mother, I make all things new.' As he looks away, even with the his face blood-drenched, he puts his head up and attunes his eyes to what is in front of him. He rises; looking ahead with such determination that one cannot help but be drawn to tears. 	As for those who would claim that the film is anti-Semitic, it is not whatsoever. Yes, it is Jewish priests who bring Jesus to Pontius Pilate to be crucified, and yes, it is the Roman's who did the task. However, are we to believe that in the reality of Christ's life, regardless of the Biblical stories, that just because some Jews chose to persecute him, that all Jews must have wanted to persecute him? I think not. Jesus himself was Jewish, but held beliefs that the Jewish priests found blasphemous. As such, he was threat to their ways. 	As for the film's violence, it is quite a lot of take. Traditional Hollywood epics have shown the crucifixion in a lighter fashion, with less gore focusing on the glory that would come. Gibson's film does not deny that there is a reason for the violence-there was a glorious thing to come, the resurrection. However, Gibson focuses on showing how real it would be if someone were witnessing it. Furthermore, John Debney's score for the film is deeply moving, although not without a few moments of a feeling of grandeur, particularly during the resurrection. 	`The Passion of the Christ' is quite possibly one of the finest portrayals in storytelling of the event ever put on celluloid. Yes, it is brutal. Yes, it is hard to watch. But it is also a film unlike any other I have ever seen. Perhaps that is because it is in the context of Christ's life. Whether you believe in the Biblical tales or not, view this man as great for the simple reason that he died for the betterment of humanity. There is no difference between the figure of Christ than there is of other great figures like Gandhi, William Wallace or Joan Of Arc. ****",The Passion of the Christ
181,lotus_chief,"One of the most important, boldest films ever made..an absolute triumph!!",10,6 March 2004,"A reviewer here on IMDb wrote something that, the more I think about it, makes it that much harder for me to write a review for this film:  `[The Passion of the Christ] is essentially an act of faith, not a work of entertainment, and it is impossible to review it as a typical Hollywood release'.  How true....I can't sit here and write a review the way I usually do with any other movie, because this isn't just any other movie'.  The subject matter itself is so engaging and subjective; which is why there is so much controversy surrounding it.  In my opinion, Mel Gibson has made one of the most important and boldest films of all time.  I greatly respect his courage for seeing his dream through fully without compromising it.  If he does nothing else in movies, he'll always have my respect for this film.  This is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen.  I am one who can fully appreciate and recognize the necessity of the violent, gruesome nature of Passion of the Christ'.  I like what Gibson did with this film.  He didn't just follow the formula used in past Jesus films.  He took what was arguably the biggest crux in the story and showed it as real and honest as possible.  He gets right to the point, with no sugar coating.  The movie, as everyone has surely heard time and time again, is not for the faint at heart.  It's as brutal and violent as advertised.but with good reason.  I'm not going to get into my personal beliefs on religion, as a lot of other people on here couldn't help but do.  As a film, The Passion of the Christ is a masterpiece...one of the most powerful (can't use that word enough), moving movie experiences I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing.  James Caviezel really outdoes himself here with, without a doubt, the best performance of his career.  He was absolutely perfect for the role of Jesus, just the thought of him in Count of Monte Cristo' immediately made me think that no one else but him could play Jesus, based on his look alone.  However, the person who was just as good, if not better, was the actress who played Mary, Maia Morgenstern.  I haven't been moved so much by a performance as I was with hers; it is absolutely brilliant and unforgettable.  I can't say enough of how powerful, convincing and just heart-wrenching her somber, sorrowful portrayal was.  The scenery, acting, directing, the score....EVERYTHING was first-class.  Mel Gibson has really outdone himself, and I say bravo to him for making such a moving, thought-provoking and honest film about such a touchy subject.  This is what movies are supposed to be, thought-provoking.instead of the endless trash by talentless idiots shoved down our throats constantly.  As far as the controversy surrounding it, I disagree with the accusations of The Passion of the Christ' being Anti-Semitic.  I really did not get that feeling watching the film....Jews didn't kill Jesus.  MANKIND killed Jesus.   Enough with the ill advised accusations.  I've read a lot of other reviews; and a lot of people are missing the point on some issues.  People complain about Gibson's film not showing the full life of Jesus, from birth, to the miracles and so on, the way every other Jesus film in the past did.  I only have one question to that criticism:  What is the title of this film?  You guessed it!  THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST'!  Anyone expecting anything other than what was shown is just not very smart, as this is what The Passion is!  If you want to see that so bad, there's countless other films that deal with it...go rent those.  Also, anyone claiming that this is the truth' and what really happened' really sound foolish seeing that no one around now was there.  I know that this is a touchy subject, but part of the reason it is is because people take things too personal, too literal.  All Mel Gibson did was take a story and put it on screen the same way countless other directors have done in the past and continue to do to this day.  He took what was there and made a movie out of it.  People do this all the timeit's no different here. Whether or not you want to believe what is shown in the film or said in the Bible is up to you.  But don't condemn Mel Gibson for expressing his view on the story, it's not like he changed the story to suit his liking (use of minute artistic license here and there aside).  How could people be so upset if this is what's written in those pages?  When seen this way (the way it's seen and accepted in every other case in Hollywood), people wouldn't get as fired up about something so trivial.  But because this is the Bible it automatically stirs up controversy because of what everybody's personal beliefs on the scriptures are, and what they feel happened' or is the truth'.  I feel all people should watch this film, it's wonderfully made and was done the way it was purposefully to stir discussion and debate.  On the strength of that alone, it's a tremendous triumph, more so than I, and apparently Gibson as well, thought it would be.  It took a lot of courage to make this film, and again I commend Mel Gibson for seeing his vision all the way through.  This film is really a work of art, arguably the most honest and brutal film I've ever witnessed, but a very valid and necessary work. The Passion of the Christ will be talked about and debated for decades, I'm sure.  It is an absolute triumph and a film that, in my opinion, should be experienced by everyone.  A masterpiece.**** out of **** stars.  Wonderful.",The Passion of the Christ
182,DustinRahksi,"Not Christian, just love film.",7,10 September 2013,"I've gone to catholic schools all my life, all always thought is was a bunch of BS. I understand it promotes good morals, I'm all for that. Maybe it's more so the people who follow it, rather than religion itself that I don't like. I don't believe in it, but I won't completely deny it, that's my same stance on ghosts. It could have happened, maybe not how the bible says, who knows. I am pretty well versed on the new testament, so the film fit's in well. The film was alright, it really didn't seem all that high quality. It definitely isn't a masterpiece of film making, more like am average effort, sorry Mel. It was still entertaining, and kept my interest all the way through. This is from a fan of film, nothing more, nothing less.The good: I guess the setting was well done, it looked good. The script was severely lacking, of course it has to stay true to the source material, but this is a film that requires more than what we got. That also ties in with how it only focuses on the trial and execution of Christ, rather than all the teachings he gave us. Sure it gives a few flashbacks throughout the film, most of which are easily identifiable. A lot of people complained about the violence, you know because the bible was rated G. It was a more realistic approach, I thought it was better they show. Even if at times it was way overdone, like the bladed whip ripping the flesh around his ribs, that seamed there just for shock value. But the image of Jesus on the cross, made it stick in your mind more.The most infamous scene being the torture in the courtyard, it seems this effected people whether they were religious or not. I find the soldiers in charge of the torture to be like demented cartoon characters. They were portrayed as soulless monsters, just for effect I guess.The acting was all around decent, nothing worthy of praise though. But they did just seem to be characters on paper, and were not fleshed out at all. He didn't take any liberties with the characters, they never moved beyond emotionally saddened. I found the music to be a little generic, sure it had a middle eastern vibe to it, but was nothing that I would remember anytime soon. I can't stand reading the bible, but if they made more films about it, then I'd probably be more interested. I thought the parts with the devil gave it a more unsettling feel, it would work great for a horror film. Overall, the film isn't half bad, it's nothing great. But it was worth watching, I feel like being a little less harsh to this subject matter.Of course Mel Gibson got a huge amount of backlash for this film, but he needed to make it in a time were he was down in life. Of course using such fragile subject matter wasn't the best thing he could have done. But he did make a 200 million dollar paycheck. I thought Braveheart was more well done than this, I haven't seen Apocalypto, so I can't speak for that. The messages of the film were alone the lines of forgiveness and perseverance for the better. There is another message I can't quite put my finger on, but it's there somewhere. It has to be about how even those who persecuted him, felt some sort of belief or sympathy at times. That humans can correct their ways, and understand their sins. Something along those lines.At the end of the day, people either loved it, complained about it, or down right hated it and Mel Gibson. As it being a film, it's just average. But as it being a good story, it succeeds. Not Gibson's best work, but it is worth a watch. You'll at least get get some kind of reaction to it. This could have easily have been over 3 hours, and had a lot more story put into it, but I'm fine with the way it is. I think it should have been more developed.",The Passion of the Christ

Mel Gibson is a hardcore fundamentalist, but the touches of angels and devils, worms coming out of their noses, children turning into tormenting demons are relatively far and few between, and tastefully yucky. On the other hand, there's also very little of the ecstasy of Christ in this film.So what you're left with is Romans smacking him bloody, whipping him until the blood drenches the cobblestones, sticking thorns on him until he bleeds all over, crushing him under a cross and kicking him some more when he collapses... As you might guess from this description, it's not for the faint hearted, and emphasizes the painful human end of Christ.I rather enjoyed that the movie was in Latin and Aramaic, having studied Latin in School. However, the language coaches should have done a bit more research: the Latin spoken here is the Italicized version of the middle ages, not likely as spoken in the Roman Empire. How do we know that? Well, the Romans had a big empire with a lot of foreigners working in it and in need of language instruction, and a lot of books on language instruction with cross references to Etruscan, Gaul and so forth, that allows a surprisingly reliable, albeit imperfect, reconstruction of what Roman Latin probably sounded like. Not like this film, for sure. It only annoyed me because if you are going to be snobbish and do the film in the original languages, do it right. I confess I also always cringe when the bad Nazi guys speak broken German!A semi-historical drama, with wailing women, suffering Christ, brutal Romans, a spineless Pontius Pilate, chariots and crosses. Well done really, if in the end somewhat mind-numbing because it's just torture after torture after torture. If you want to see the same subject with a mix of satire and comedy, and you don't mind seeing this subject treated with British humor, go see ""The Life of Brian"" by Monty Python. Although it may be heresy, it is better comedy than ""Passion"" is drama.",The Passion of the Christ
186,Ronin47,"Good, but it's no masterpiece (***)",7,6 March 2004,"""The Passion Of The Christ"" is the end result of Mel Gibson's painstaking, years-long journey to bring the final 12 hours of Christ's life to the screen in a realistic way. It's clear that he really wants this movie to be a masterpiece, and though I like it, it's not quite all it could (or should) be. I'm not a very religious person - honestly, I don't know quite what I believe. But I was raised Baptist, so this story certainly does get to me on some level. Whether you believe in this story or not, it's still a pretty riveting experience most of the time. My only real problems with it are that it's awkwardly paced (several slightly dull stretches), repetitive, and perhaps most damaging of all, it's been edited like a mainstream action movie (WAY too much slow-motion and bombastic music). Also, from what I understand of the story, Gibson's attempt to make Pontius Pilate into basically a ""good guy"" is a bit misguided. Aside from these drawbacks, ""The Passion Of The Christ"" is a pretty worthwhile movie. The cinematography is nice, the film has a thick, palpable atmosphere, and though the performances are overall merely competent, Maia Morgenstern stands out as the Virgin Mary, as does Rosalinda Celentano as a profoundly creepy, androgynous Satan. It ain't no masterpiece, but the subject matter has an undeniable charge to it and there hasn't been anything like it in years (Martin Scorcese's ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" was better, though). It certainly isn't a fun trip to the movies, but it's a worthy film.",The Passion of the Christ

189,The_Orenda,Firmly disappointed.,2,3 October 2005,"I don't want to say this, but I was not really gripped into The Passion. My live-in girlfriend, who refers to me as a ""fallen Catholic,"" mentioned that Caviezel was actually whipped during what I can only call the 'chastise him,' scene. To James, I can only say I feel sorry for you. The movie is one of the most brutal films of all time, but it wasn't the gore that I had the most trouble with. Was there really any point of putting the devil in this movie? And personally, I felt that if you decide to put Mary in the movie, either make the most of her or don't even use her at all. The pain of watching your son being crucified should have sunk in more. And yet, ironically, I find that the melodrama was what really hurt this movie. Passion screams of pitiful sorrow not for His tormentors and enemies, which He would have preferred, but for Jesus and all His friends. To me, that was the fatal flaw for filming and directing a narrative of one of civilization's greatest prophets: you completely missed his perspective and purpose. Instead, we're treated to a modern view of a two thousand year-old 'chastise' and crucifixion. An exercise of martyrdom and ""dying for our sins,"" rather than forgiveness and a true sense of passion! Mel could have chopped off an hour of film to prove a better point, but hundreds of millions of dollars later, I can never be the one to judge.",The Passion of the Christ
190,Tehmeh,One of the most important movies for me.,10,14 April 2017,"I won't even pretend that I can view this movie objectively. I'm a believer, or at least try to be, so it's not just just a movie for me. I felt obligated to write my thoughts about it nonetheless, and in my review I try to treat ""Passion of the Christ"" as a movie too, not only as a film about the foundation of my faith. I will not judge anyone or force my faith on others in this review, although I will talk about faith a little.""Passion of the Christ"" is a movie about 12 hours of Jesus' life leading to His death at the cross. During the movie, there are a few flashbacks, mostly concerning His teachings and interactions with the people He loved and who loved Him, but the heart of the movie is in His suffering.That suffering is hard to watch, and it's relentless. It's intentionally relentless, to the point where many people will say that it's just a torture movie. That observation isn't entirely invalid. Mel Gibson doesn't hold much back in that regard. And that's also the point of this film: to show how Christ was ready and determined to take that torture. It's horrifying and almost constant, and He takes it. That's what the ""passion"" means. Jesus had many opportunities to get out of the situation He was in, but He did what He was meant to do. In that torture, the viewer is supposed to see both the evil of mankind (including the evil in ourselves), and also the love of God, because in that context God suffered for us. This is the point of the movie, and the focus remains there at all times.This film isn't just a faithful adaptation of the Gospels, because indeed there are added scenes and some imagery for dramatization purposes. Almost all of it is based on some existing writings or accounts, some of them very debated, and the ones that are made up for this movie ""on the spot"", serve the themes well and don't come across as desperate attempts to create something new just for the heck of it. None of it feels pretentious for me, and all of it serves the story.Cinematography (by Caleb Deschanel) is excellent. It's beautiful, haunting and effective without trying to impress you cynically. Same with music (by John Debney): at times it's very subdued and other times it's beautiful and powerful and the same time, getting louder and louder, really driving the emotion home. The very last shots of this movie are great examples of these two elements working together amazingly well.The spoken language is mostly Latin and Aramaic. It brings a lot of authenticity to everything, so don't fret if you normally don't like reading subtitles.Performances are great. Caviezel conveys the suffering and determination of Jesus very well. Monica Bellucci and Maia Morgenstern (Mary and Mary) are excellent with what they have, delivering some heartbreaking moments. When they cried, I cried too. Everyone is good in this movie. Everyone cared, even those with only a few seconds on the screen, and it shows. Some performances might seem a little over the top, and perhaps they are, but it's always intentional and in favor of the story. Somehow Mel Gibson knows how to make extremely unsubtle, on-the-nose elements and characters work thematically, and none of it is cynical. The releasing of Barabbas is one of those scenes where this is evident.""Passion of the Christ"" is a movie that's hard to watch, but for me it's also a must-watch. It brings this story to life, putting the suffering of Christ right in front of us, almost forcing us to stop and think. It's a beautifully-made movie, powerfully executed and doesn't apologize for what it is. It can be a draining experience, but in the end there is hope. And we can take that hope with us.",The Passion of the Christ
191,merrywood,A great story with no apparent ending -,10,22 March 2004,"Two thousand years ago a carpenter had an idea based on his reasoning mind and inspiration. He preached this idea: that love and forgiveness are the only possible direction for humanity.  The leaders of the prevailing religious establishment of which the carpenter is a member, not only failed to understand this idea but they decided to do away with the carpenter in absolute demonstration of their lack of understanding.  Even as he is brutalized and killed, the carpenter demonstrates his conviction of this idea. This filmic depiction of the old story is extraordinary.A great deal of humanity today has not gotten the message and so as we look at today's Middle-East and the continuous killing of the past half century we should come to realize the truth behind the carpenter's beneficent idea.Some people who see this particularly intense depiction of the old story bring to it a great deal of their emotional baggage.  Because of the intensity of this depiction, some viewers actually focus only on the tribulation of the carpenter and not on the message of the story.  It is to this specific segment of the audience that the story might be directed, repeatedly, with the hope that some day they will get the message.",The Passion of the Christ
192,QueenMakeda84,Really powerful!,10,29 February 2004,"I saw this movie on Friday and knew I wanted to come on here and add my 2 cents. The movie had me crying to the point of an all night headache. Just to think that my God went through all that for everyone is really beautiful. The love He has for the world in infinite. I don't find the film anti-Semitic because his supporters were Jews and his ""enemies"" were Jews. The point is that everyone is culpable in His death. He said no man had the power to kill Him unless He gave Himself up. Which is exactly what He did. To say that it's anti-Semitic is missing the point that every one person from the past till now is responsible for His death. His reason for living was to save us all. Not point fingers. If anyone does attack a Jewish person based on this movie, then they don't understand God or His plan. He's not dead, because He rose again, so why attack someone? To attack a Jew is to attack yourself. Anwywho, the scenes were gruesome, but they made their point. When it's shown, you understand the magnitude of His sacrifice. I cried so much, it was unreal. I have new found respect and love for my Jesus. I loved the fact that the film was in Aramaic and Latin because it made it even more real. It drew me in because I couldn't understand on a certain level. I like historically accurate movies, so that was a good decision to make. The person who really drew my eyes was the woman who played Satan. Her snake-like movement made her just so creepy, but it was all good acting. She was just very enticing visually. When she spoke, you felt so chilled. For someone to make you feel that way and not speak English is wow.It was strange. With every character, I felt what they felt. With Mary, I felt the nurturing sense to want to protect Him and fight for Him, to hold Him. Tell Jesus I was there. I'm not even remotely a mother yet, but I felt those things. With Mary Magdalene, I felt her eternal gratitude for Jesus saving her from a life of despair and hatred. I felt Peter's anger when Judas wanted to take Him in and when he cut off the soldier's ear. The very desire to want to protect Jesus was within me when I watched it. It was strange, you hoped it would turn out differently, but you know how it ends, well, begins in my eyes. This story has never hit me the way it has with this movie and I see that as a blessing and sign from God. Mel did a wonderful job. The music, the cinematography, the acting, the costumes, the makeup, everything came together so that you felt, smelled, and touched everything there. SPOILER ALERT!!! The end where he just gets up victorious is wonderful. It exemplifies how the order of things has changed and His work here was done, but He's now preparing a place for all of us who want to be with Him and know Him. Naturally, there are some creative licenses, but the meat of the gospel is still the same. Jesus felt temptation and was scared about what He had to do, but He just trusted the Father throughout. It was a perfect balance between Jesus the Divine and Jesus the Man. The only part I'm not too sure about is when Satan's holding a child I presume, but it looks like it has progeria (the rapid aging of toddlers). The child/elder smiles at Jesus being scourged, but I wasn't sure what that meant. It looked like one of the demon kids that tortured Judas mentally, but without hair and a bit smaller. But, if that's the case, at the end, Satan is screaming angrily I guess because He followed God's will. Did Satan think Jesus would give up when he was being tortured? Like, not go through with it? SPOILER DONE!!! I don't know, but that's the only thing that confused me. All in all, 10 out of 10 great movie. I hope more people start to turn to God as a result of this film. Watch it for whatever reason you want to: as a Christian, an opposing faith, an atheist, for entertainment, a history buff, whatever. Just watch it. It's a beautiful and spectacular film. Kudos to Jim and Mel and the rest of the cast and crew for allowing Jesus to come into the mainstream. About time!",The Passion of the Christ
193,perica-43151,"Orange eyed man impeached by hysterical status quo worshipers, undergoes Golgotha and comes victorious against the she-devil",9,22 October 2019,"This movie traces passion of Christ according to canon, with very few alterations and presents a powerful, authentic story for believers and nonbelievers alike. There are very few liberties taken in this beautifully rendered cinematographic gem, demonstrating once more confident powers of Gibson as a director. Pharisees are portrayed in a traditional light that has since Holocaust been scaled down by Catholic church official policies, but the movie also portrays Simon as a Jew, and hence the film's reputation as anti Semitic is overblown. The Pharisees can be understood as bearers of traditional power, that oppose the Christ teachings on the grounds of their corruption by he very power they hold. The Biblical story has many interpretations, but it is surprising how it can be transferred to the story of modern day Pharisees (mainstream media) against modern day orange man who uncovers their hypocrisy in an unconventional way. Impeached by the Jewish court, Jesus is forced to die on the cross, as he is a threat to the powers that be. The female she-devil in the shape shifting form of a worm-snake, as a mirage, is has plenty of present day woke counterparts. Of course, Jesus is the ultimate rebel, who died for sins of humanity, and this narrative applies to many contexts, an the power of this movie is that it provides us with one of the most faithful movies about this deep archetype of human civilization, regardless of religious affiliation.",The Passion of the Christ

195,Condemned-Soul,"Hard to watch, but even harder to look away...",8,11 July 2017,"The Passion of the Christ makes you, as the viewer, suffer. The infliction of the pain on Jesus is felt every step of the way, and its hard to watch, but just as hard to look away.Mel Gibson's ambitious and controversial biblical epic about the final hours of Jesus leading up to his crucifixion is stunningly shot, edited and directed to wring the maximum amount of emotion out of the audience. Whether or not you believe in the story or not (I'm the former) you'll be hard pressed not to have a tear in your eye at some point during the agonising events depicted in this film thanks to the beautiful Oscar-nominated music. It doesn't shy away from the graphic violence, but also doesn't glorify it. It simply shows you the suffering Jesus endured on the path to his final destination, as we move parallel with him. Extended torture sequences make you squirm in your seat with the horror occurring before you, unable to help much like Jesus' mother Mary watching at the sidelines, making you want to almost say aloud 'enough is enough, leave this man alone'. But that's the movie's achievement, bringing the raw emotion out in all of us, making us forget for a short while that this is a piece of filmmaking of a very high standard. Its fully subtitled, but even without glancing at the translations you'll have a very strong idea of whats happening. What little dialogue there is, and particularly the well implemented flashbacks, is powerfully written, lending to the upsetting tone for the inevitable outcome. The Passion of the Christ is brilliant, and not to be missed. 8.5/10!",The Passion of the Christ
196,rcavellero,BRINGING ART BACK INTO THE MOVIES!,10,25 February 2004,"I'm sure without a doubt that a lot of people are going to have problems with this film. Especially since it deals with religion. But there is no excuse to meet such a fantastic film. Had the movie been about someone else I feel that I would've appreciated it just as much. Not that the history didn't lend a helping hand in understanding the film.  This film is an incredibly compelling work of art. The film mostly takes place in the last 12 hours of Jesus except for a few selected, effective flashback sequences. The torture is almost unbearable as I felt that I had absolutely endured it with him. But i feel in the end all the scenes, every one, and perhaps some that are missing are necessary in fully realizing the story and the importance of it's effectiveness.  The film features good performances all around, sparkling cinematograpghy and a dramatic, memorable score.  Now as far as the film being anti semetic or anti anything. I didn't percieve it to be. It just basically told a story as realistically as it could. And in this day and age it take sthe gruesomeness shown to truly get a reaction out of people. I am catholic and ot very religious but after seeing this film it makes me want to discover religion and attend church. And I'm sure alot of people felt the same because as the movie ended there was standing ovation in a small theatre in Nj. Kudos to Mel Gibson for bringing the power and passion of art back into cinema.",The Passion of the Christ
197,TheFilmGuy1,A Brutal Tale,6,23 August 2014,"As someone who wouldn't specifically identify himself with any religion, I look at this films story, and I don't think about whether it actually happened or not. That's not the point of my review. That being said, I do know the story of Jesus' crucifixion and this film was disappointing in a way, but I also think this film will probably be about as good as a film adaptation of this tale will get. The movies biggest strength is Jim Caviezels performance. You witness all the terrible things that happen to Jesus, and no punches are pulled. You can feel the pain and suffering in Caviezels performance, and it's really great. I think the issue with this movie is that it kind of feels boring and, at times, uninspired. Sure, it has some interesting visual choices at times, but a lot of it just felt really plain. Some of the visuals that try to be metaphorical or show something deep or meaningful sometimes don't work as well, which is an issue. The whole crucifixion scene is the best part of the whole movie, because it's the most emotional and brutal part. If only the rest of the film could deliver the punch that this sequence does, but sadly it doesn't, perhaps aside from the whipping scene. As I said in the start, I do kind of think that this is probably the best we will get of an adaptation of the crucifixion of Jesus. It just feels like there's not many ways to tell it, and this film chooses the more realistic and brutal way, which is most likely the best way it could be told. So in my opinion, even though it's not that great, there probably won't be a better film about this specific part of Jesus' life. Then again, I could be proved wrong some time in the future.",The Passion of the Christ
198,ScottAmundsen,"Gory, Repellent, and Pointless",1,20 June 2011,"First let me say that I have been a Christian for forty-three years. I am well aware of what Jesus Christ suffered on that day, and I have sufficient imagination to picture just how horrible it was without having a movie rub my nose in it for more than two hours.I will say one thing in this movie's favor: The title is accurate. This movie is about the Crucifixion and nothing else. When Jesus dies, the movie ends so abruptly that my first reaction was ""that's it?"" Oddly enough, while the actual events probably took the better part of an entire day to unfold, at slightly over two hours this movie is painfully overlong, a situation made worse by Gibson's overuse of slow-motion visual effects.But the worst of it is that, since the whole film is taken up with the trial and the Crucifixion, we are left with little information about this man who is being put to death. Despite an earnest effort from James Caviezel in a handful of flashback scenes, I would bet money that someone who never heard the story and saw this film would ask, ""Who was this Jesus and why did they do this to Him?"" To make matters even worse, Gibson has made technical and historical errors all over the place. The actors all look far too Caucasian, for a start, despite the occasional black face in some of the crowd scenes. And perhaps the biggest goof is the walk down the Via Dolorosa. Jesus walks amid a line of other condemned men, which is accurate, but the others are all carrying only the crossbeams to their crosses while Jesus's cross is all in one big piece and considerably larger than the others. This is a total fallacy: at the time the Romans crucified people as a matter of course and the suggestion that they viewed Him as somehow special does not make sense historically.Moreover, Gibson's decision to film this story using the original Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek languages (with subtitles), while ambitious and interestingly successful enough, creates an emotional distance between the movie and the audience in a film that is already off-putting enough.Ultimately, though, my biggest complaint is that this movie is completely pointless. I can't speak for all Christians, of course, but is it really necessary to see all of the blood and gore up close and personal to believe? Not for me, anyway. As for non-Christians, if Gibson's idea was to reach out to them, he would have done better to show who Jesus the man was instead of producing this long, pretentious, boring, and utterly pointless gorefest.If I did not have to give it one star I would have given it none.",The Passion of the Christ
199,diand_,A long film about killing,7,28 March 2004,"Movies usually guide us through violence by using several cinematic devices to keep us ""entertained"" and involved to a certain level in a story. When a movie refuses to use those devices and focuses almost exclusively on cruelty, by stripping away the usual context, the public has no escape route and another controversial film is born.Kieslowski's Dekalog (modern interpretations of the 10 commandments) immediately springs to mind. ""A short film about killing"" involved closeups of the slow and brutal killing of a taxi driver (and the subsequent state execution) that seemed to last indefinitely while watching it. Last year's scandal movie ""Irreversible"" provided an uninterrupted rape scene of about 5 minutes that is almost unbearable to watch. (Interesting enough, the victim was Monica Bellucci who now plays Magdalene in ""The Passion of the Christ"".)The only relief in The Passion of the Christ comes from flashbacks (or sometimes slow motion) which explain previous interactions between Jesus and others. What makes Gibson's movie interesting is that by confronting the viewers in this manner he in a way pleads for a more pure form of Christianity. However, a movie that has religion as subject is not always religious in its form and here lies the problem with this movie. It tries too hard to be a bible lesson and too less to show moral, ethical and religious implications of actions. Take Tarkovsky's Offret for instance: a movie that almost feels like a religious experience instead of recreating historic religious events.Unfortunately, Mel Gibson is an average director. The movie could have seriously gained from a better production design and art direction. Actors and actresses are almost puppets in stead of characters with any depth. The historical context however (especially the Romans) is pretty accurate and the three languages contribute to this feeling. The opening sequences are reminiscent of some scenes of the LOTR and are a promising starting point. In the end the movie uses some imagination that when used in the whole movie would have made the masterpiece it will never be.",The Passion of the Christ

It is really scary to see stated as a fact that Jesus spoke Aramaic, when it has been proved beyond all doubt that Aramaic was the language of the priests, the pharisees and the scribes of Jesus time. It was reckoned a high-class language.How is it possible to secularize a message like this, in such a way, and trample Christ into the dust like it Mel Gibson has done?

201,FilmSnobby,The fruition of Mel Gibson's masochistic neurosis.,1,30 November 2004,"You can't say he didn't warn us. In my review of Gibson's *Braveheart* here at IMDb, I took due note of the culminating sequence in which Wallace (played by Gibson) is laid out on a cross (it's laid out horizontally, but still) and disemboweled. Let it be said that Mel Gibson is not the first artist to have a Christ-identification complex. Artists, after all, have colossal egos. Only the Son of God will do as a personal role model, presumably; though some artists more modestly identify with lesser mortals like Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Michelangelo, or Shakespeare.But Gibson may be the first artist to WHOLLY identify with the bloody climax of Jesus' brief but world-changing life. In *The Passion of the Christ*, Gibson simply can't be bothered with Jesus' actual ministry: we get a mere line here and there from the Sermon on the Mount or during the Last Supper. These puny morsels of Christ's teachings -- or, should I say, Gibson's irritable concessions to the conventions of your typical Hollywood Biblical epic -- are presented to us via flashback, but, like a football fan making a dash to the john during the Super Bowl, Gibson doles these scenes out hastily because he wants to get back to the Big Game. In fact, the flashbacks are practically the only scenes in the film that are NOT in slow-motion, that dreaded sign of film-making amateurishness and, coincidentally, one of Gibson's favorite cinematic tools. Most of the movie is in slow-motion because, after all is said and done, there's really not much to this story, in terms of cinematic narrative. A rabbi is accused of blasphemy in Roman-occupied Judea. The Jews demand that the Roman procurator put the rabbi to death. The procurator does so, and, in accordance with Roman tradition, the rabbi suffers the fate of those who are NOT Roman citizens who also commit capital crimes: he's crucified. The End. The slow-motion serves as a time-killer. What should have lasted a half-hour goes on for over two.But the slow-motion also serves Gibson's other purpose, which is to apparently wallow in Christ's flogging and eventual crucifixion. It seems that he has told himself that his purpose was to explicitly present what the Son of Man went through, for our sakes. But didn't we already KNOW that? It's a hard story to avoid, considering the 2,000 years of religious texts, art, and music that have reinforced these images and ideas in the minds of all who have ever lived in the Western world. What made Mel Gibson think he was either 1) doing something new here, or 2) ""reminding"" the world about Christ's Passion? The point of presenting the Passion in any artistic medium is to give form and significance to the greatest sacrifice ever undertaken for the sake of humanity. (Cf., your typical Pieta by Michelangelo. Perhaps Gibson ought to join the tourists in all those dreary Italian museums -- he might learn something.) This material demands thoughtfulness, and careful (and respectful!) precision. Gibson offers, instead, a howling demon that snaps at Judas after he betrays his Master. Fun-house scares instead of artistic sublimity. Millions of important dollars spent on special gore effects rather than ten minutes contemplating a compositional frame. (If Gibson's so religious, why didn't he use all that money -- his own, apparently -- to set up a trust fund for all the unwanted babies his theology insists on bringing into the world?) There's not a jot of the necessary gratitude for the Saviour in this presentation . . . there's only the urge to shock the ""liberal elites"" with what Gibson presumes to be ugly realism. Red meat for the red states. Unfortunately for Gibson, poor Jim Caviezel inevitably elicits chuckles once he embarks on the Seven Stations: the Romans whip him, he falls, he can't get up, he eventually DOES get up, they whip him, he falls again. In slow motion. Meanwhile, Satan wanders in from time to time, fresh from a Mel Brooks spoof of an Ingmar Bergman art movie. I mean, really: one just has to laugh, at some point.But Gibson can take much heart: *The Passion* has revealed that his own sadomasochistic neurosis -- weirdly mixed up somehow with Christianity -- is shared by a much larger mass of humanity than even the most cynical liberal elite could possibly have suspected. Well, Gibson IS a showman, and showmen understand the darkest desires of crowds. Gibson understands that the parents who will force their children to watch this neurotic nightmare of a movie are the same parents who complained the loudest when Janet Jackson's middle-aged dug was flashed to a world-wide audience. A human breast has no place in this Cult of Blood, this Cult of Death . . . unless, I suppose, someone in campy Roman gear is flaying the skin off of it. Christianity is a religion that really deserves better than the likes of the mentally unstable Mel Gibson and his fevered fans. The discerning movie-lover CERTAINLY deserves better. 1 dispassionate star out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
202,elcopy,Sadistical and manipulative.,3,29 February 2004,"I got nothing out of this movie.Let's imagine before you go to see this movie you don't know the story. You don't know the situation that lead to this story. You don't know its message. Then what you have is a two hour version of a Middle Ages' painting. The torture of one man, in explicit detail, takes half of the movie. You have to be a sadist to find this enjoyable.But this movie is not meant to be enjoyable. It's meant to make you sick. To make you feel guilty. It's a two-hour commercial for the Catholic Church, who had spent centuries making believers out of guilt-trips.How ironic Jesus death was a result of his rebellion against the man-made institution of church. The very institution that nows uses his image for its own promotion.Something good can be taken out of this horrible spectacle of a movie. I hope it opens a debate about the dead penalty and the torture of prisoners, still going on strong 2,000 years after this happened.PS: I don't speak neither of the languages in the movie. But, as a fan of foreign films, I noticed a lack of fluidity in the actors' lines that diminished its realism.6/10",The Passion of the Christ

204,DanB-4,"Brilliant, Moving and Uplifting",10,27 February 2004,"Mel Gibson's purpose behind The Passion of The Christ was to depict as accurately as he could see possible, the final 12 hours of Jesus' Earthly life. It was not about his teachings or his works. It is an unflinching and brutal look at the death Jesus incurred for our sins.I thought it was brilliant. There are two sides to me that watched, the movie lover and the faithful followers and both were completely satisfied. It is very violent to be sure, but by no means unwatchable. I felt a certain warmth, believe it or not, watching this movie, because the Jesus portrayed to me very clearly that he accepted this end to his life lovingly and willingly and that it would soon end and be worth the trial.There were three occasions that I winced and turned away, once during the scourging and twice during the crucifixion. The sight of Jesus' beaten to a pulp was hard to take, but I do believe that this is likely an accurate portrayal of how things went down.From a technical standpoint, this film is outstanding, particularly the camera work and make-up. Oscar nominations are certain in those areas, possibly costumes and editing as well. The special effects used during the scourging were amazing.If I have a complaint about this film, it is the depection of the Roman Guards. They come across as cartoon characters. While I am certain that many were sadistic and delighted in torture, this is mashed in our face a little too often. The piercing of Jesus' side was done in an unnecessary manner as well.I cannot say the the movie laid any blame for the death of Jesus. The Passion clearly portrays the conflict between those who followed Jesus, those who wanted him killed and those who stood by and watched. It also very clearly shows Jesus accepting his fate. The thing that works best in this film is the relationship between Jesus and his mother - the portrayal of Mary is brilliant and heartbreaking , especially the flashbacks to earlier in Jesus' life. This was a side of The Passion I had never really considered and Mary's bravery and acceptance of her son's fate was truly moving.This is a very violent film to be sure. For most of its running time, Jesus is being beaten, whipped or crucified, and it does not let up for a moment. There are a couple of over the top scenes, but nothing that I found objectionable. Young teens and children and those who cannot handle the constant flow of blood should avoid this. I can completely understand why this movie is polarizing audiences and critics. I did not find the violence off-putting, but some may and for many, it will cloud the message of the movie and that is understandable. For me, a singularly unique, moving and yes, uplifting movie experience. **** out of ****",The Passion of the Christ
205,justincasey083,An Extremely Violent Depiction Of The Passion Of Christ,10,2 August 2019,"Mel Gibson directed a film about the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ starting from the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane until his death on the cross with a preview of his resurrection at the conclusion. It stars Jim Caviezel in the title role together with Maia Morgenstern, Monica Bellucci and Hristo Shopov.The movie was evidently extremely violent as the viewer is treated to a bloody depiction of Jesus Christ during his passion and death on the cross. The movie was evidently sadistic that one would feel discomfort especially as the viewer sees Jesus go through his ordeal on the cross for the salvation of mankind and to renew his standing in the eyes of God. It was obvious that it grossly exaggerated and it would adhere to the taste of blood-thirsty viewers.What saved it from total disaster is showing the resurrection of Jesus at the end. While some viewers will have the movie get to them particularly the extremely violent scenes,the resurrection obviously will provide a spiritual message that Jesus is willing to go through the enormous sufferings for the sake of mankind's salvation. Added to that,it also will provide the viewer possibly a better appreciation for what Jesus did and would probably give them motivation to change their ways for the better and in obedience to God's commandments.",The Passion of the Christ

It stars Jim Caviezel as Jesus together with an ensemble of international cast.It was obvious that the movie is extremely violent as it tries to portray the sufferings of Jesus from being scourged at the pillars, being crowned with thorns, being nailed to the cross, and dying on the cross. These scenes were exaggerated as it presents enormous blood that Jesus bled during these events as well as the extreme amount of pain that he experienced. It was apparent that it tries to present the level of suffering that Jesus have suffered for the redemption of mankind and for their salvation. Some viewers could be turned off by it.Despite these scenes,the movie saved itself from ruin by showing a glimpse of Jesus' resurrection inside the tomb.Apparently,there will be a movie about it with the same cast and the same director. At least,the glimpse of the resurrection scene provides the viewer hope and that Jesus indeed is for the benefit of mankind and to renew their standing in the eyes of God.",The Passion of the Christ
207,fubared1,Gruesome Sadistic Horror Film,2,31 January 2005,"This has to rate as one of the most graphic horror films I have ever seen, beating out the likes of 'Dawn of the Dead', 'Dead Alive', ant 'Evil Dead'. It could easily be summarized as the death of Christ, told mostly in slow motion. This is just simply a bad film, and I find very little to recommend it. The acting is mediocre, the entire film appears to have been shot through a brown filter, the music is dull and unimaginative, and as I said, Mel directs almost half the film in extremely slow motion. In fact, looking at it, I can only assume this film would be appreciated by a true sadist. In fact De Sade himself would have loved it! The torture is shown in highly graphic detail, and though one knows it's fake, it's like the scene with the excrement in 'Salo'. You know it must be chocolate pudding, but that doesn't make it any more appetizing. All I can guess is that Mel is one, sick, twisted mind, if indeed, he has any brains at all. He is an actor, after all. So, unless your into graphic torture and blood and gore, I suggest you avoid this nonsense. And even if you are into those things, I'd still avoid it as it is also extremely dull storytelling.",The Passion of the Christ

However, IMHO it's NOT a film for any child below 10 to watch and I saw many people in the theatre having kids present.

209,bburns,A merely okay version of the Greatest Story of All Time,7,28 May 2004,"The Life of Jesus has been filmed at least once per generation ever since the invention of motion pictures.  Unfortunately, there has never been a great version of this story.  The film that came closest was Pasolini's ""The Gospel of St. Matthew"", but that was marred by weak acting and cheap production values.  Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" lacks either weakness, but they are more than made up for by Gibson's complete lack of subtlety or nuance.As I said, the acting in this movie is very good, especially Jim Caviezel as Jesus.  Hopefully the Academy will remember him next spring.  Francesco De Vito as Peter and Hristo Shopov as Pilate are also noteworthy.  And--with the exception of the digital retouching which makes Jesus' irises look red--the production values are rich, textured, and realistic.  One is constantly reminded just how much Jesus truly suffered at the hands of his tormentors and how much Nazi Germany borrowed from the Roman Empire.But the problems start very early in the movie.  When Jesus is taken before Caiphas (Mattia Sbragia), we do not see a venerated rabbi who honestly believes that Jesus is a heretic.  Instead we see a shifty-eyed villain who is merely after the blood of a rival and who does not care about right and wrong.  Later in the movie, Herod (Luca De Dominicis) is portrayed as a homophobic caricature.  And the various Roman soldiers and Pharisee zealots are cackling, foaming-at-the-mouth sadists.  Only the morally conflicted Pontius Pilate comes across as a fully three-dimensional and human antagonist.As far as the film's alleged anti-Semitism is concerned, it's very subtle if it's there at all.  In this film (and I don't see any proof in Scripture for this) the Roman authorities are initially less than fully compliant in Jesus' arrest.  However, the non-Pharisee Jewish characters in the film all acknowledge Jesus as a holy man when they come into contact with him.But with all the blood and gore, along with the elderly dwarf actors playing demons, and a not-very-funny comic interlude (with Jesus the Carpenter making a tall table) this film has a typical action-movie in-your-face attitude, which I think is inappropriate for spreading the Word of God.Although Christ's death is a major part of human history, this film would have you believe that His death was more important than His life.  This movie is meant to make the viewer feel all the pain of Jesus during His final hours.  I would prefer a film that made you feel His love for all humanity.  If I made a movie about Jesus, I would tell the whole story, from the Manger to the Resurrection.  Rather than focus on His violent death, I would focus on His teachings--especially the ones that people who brag about their Christianity often choose to ignore:  ""Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth"", ""Judge not, lest ye be judged"", ""When you give, let not the left hand know what the right hand is doing"", ""Give unto Caesar what is Caesar's"", and ""Love thine enemies"".  And when it came to His death, instead of the standard Hollywood bad guys, I would show that He was murdered by zealots who refused to admit that no religious faction has a monopoly on truth, an unpopular government trying to hang on to its authority, and several people who either were too scared to stand up to the religious and governmental authorities or who honestly believed that they were doing the right thing.""The Passion of the Christ"" is a good but not great film that focuses too narrowly on Jesus' suffering and death and not enough on His life and teaching.  7 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
210,loufalce,A Good Try,6,7 December 2007,"Even though I found it to be too slow going, rather heavily handed, and way, way too violent, I must congratulate Mr. Gibson for taking a risk, and for actually making a movie that people went to see. There really is no anti Semetism,and Jesus is portrayed as being a victim of the times. The film features a very intense musical score-totally opposite what Miklos Rosza would have done, and the use of ancient Aramaic{with subtitles} gives this film a distant, almost alien feel. This non-epic does feature some good acting by a mostly no-name cast, with Cavaziel turning in an interesting portrayal as Christ. The crucifixion sequences are just too graphic to actually look at, but that is what earned this film its R rating. All in all, a good try and Gibson does deserve some credit for pulling it off. Prehaps I'm old fashioned, but most of this material was handled a lot better in Ben-Hur and King of Kings. Anyway, this controversial film will definitely have you talking-and thinking as well. On this point alone, the film is worth seeing, but if you are looking for a reverent and moving epic, look elsewhere.",The Passion of the Christ
211,williambendavis-933-218958,"Not amazing, not terrible, somewhere in the middle",5,5 April 2015,"Is it a terrible movie? No. It is an amazing movie? Well, no. It's somewhere in the middle. It is a competently made movie, don't get me wrong. There are things I like about it. It just could have been a much better movie. All the actors did a great job. They all played their parts convincingly and it's also pretty impressive that they all spoke another language the entire time (Is it Hebrew? I think it's Hebrew). I have mixed feelings about the violence. On one hand, it's a more honest portrayal of the Crucifixion (I'm pretty sure anyway. I'm an Atheist, I'm not entirely sure). On the other hand, it just makes this a 2 hour Saw movie with Jesus in it. I'll leave the violence thing up in the air. It can really go either way. The one thing that is really holding this movie back, is the lack of character development for Jesus. He isn't given any qualities or personality, so it's really hard to invest any emotion into him. They kind of expect you to care about him just because he's Jesus. Since they don't really develop him, you're left with a 2 hour movie that is just this one underdeveloped guy getting brutally tortured. It makes the film slightly boring and even more like a Saw movie. There are 2 other minor things I didn't like. 1: the overuse of the slow motion. They used it way too much and it felt like it was only there to stretch out the run time. 2: whenever the Devil showed up it was kind of hilarious. He looked like a vampire and it really took me out of the movie whenever he showed up. So yeah, it's an OK movie. Christians will definitely take to the movie more, but it isn't entirely out of the realm of possibility for others to like it as well.",The Passion of the Christ
212,bjones,I think many critics must have slept through it...,10,1 March 2004,"by Bruce L. Jones, Inland Empire MensaI feel I must take the assumed position, as did the film-makers, that the biblical text is literally true. Otherwise it quickly deteriorates into unending, unresolvable arguments. I have been reading about this film for several years and originally expected much less controversy until recently. Why should this be any different of a release than, say, The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965)? I saw that film in it's original release and although there was some negative press it was no where near the commotion I saw with this. I think the answer is the hugely expanded world of technology and communication compared to that time.I arrived at the theater when just before the doors opened 2 bus loads of teenagers and kids showed up from a local Christian center, most of them between maybe 12 and 15 years old. I hoped now just for quiet if I could get in. There was absolute silence during the entire film. Nothing could be heard but the sounds of perhaps dozens of people softly sobbing in the dark.The film opened in a scene not often portrayed or discussed, Jesus' tormented night after the last supper, awaiting his destiny listening to the taunts of Satin. The majority of the film fairly much followed the biblical texts up to Jesus' decent from the cross, which looked a bit like Michelangelo's Pieta. The entire theme of the film could be easily summed up by John 3:16: `For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' There was very little interpretive material here outside biblical sources. The interpretive material that was present was nicely used to fill in to make more of a story, such as a scene depicting Jesus working as a carpenter showing a newly crafted table to his mother, Mary. The one element I did expect to ignite some controversy has not generated one word printed that I have seen, that being Gibson's use of a woman with a shaved head to depict Satan. I thought for certain that would bring howls from feminists at least. That part was played by Rosalinda Celentano, a strikingly pretty woman if not for the fact of her character.What I loved about the film is hard to condense in the limited space offered here. I might begin with the presentation in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew. That gave a wonderfully real feel to the film that would have been completely lost otherwise (some critics have cited that Greek likely would have been used also but it's not certain). Then there was the great, haunting musical score by John Debney. The entire film was a masterfully beautiful work, one of the best presentations of cinematography I have ever seen; by Caleb Deschanel. The art direction, set decoration, costuming and special effects were nothing less than superb throughout. This film has by far the best and most realistic look of a biblical era film I have ever seen. It was a visual feast. The casting was sheer genius. James Caviezel as Jesus or more accurately, `Yeshua bar Yosef' was magnificent. It is the best portrayal of the Christ I have ever seen. I personally feel someone like Francesco De Vito who played Peter so well may look more like the real Jesus, but no one knows. To go on, Maia Morgenstern as the Virgin Mary was wonderful as was Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, who some scholars believe may have been Jesus' wife. Luca Lionello did wonderfully well with the much misunderstood role of Judas Iscariot (he is really the hero who insures the fulfillment of prophesy). I really enjoyed Hristo Shopov as the infamous Pontius Pilate. His role has generated much criticism as what is known historically of Pilate has him a sadistic ruler who often executed people without trial. Critics have thought his portrayal here too soft. I disagree. He was simply not given to acquiescing to the Jews who disturbed him, especially Caiphas (Mattia Sbragia), so he wanted to release the one they wanted to execute. Simple human nature. Had it been his idea he would not have hesitated to executed Jesus. He had the staff and implements for it. Those were superbly portrayed by a trio of fine actors, the two flagellators and their immediate superior who was overseeing the scourging. This is maybe the finest ensemble cast in a major film in a very long time. In fact, I am disappointed that I cannot find a complete cast list anywhere. Who is the wonderful woman who portray's the woman offering Jesus water? That's one of many missing.For negatives, there has been much made of the violence, but from the considerable history I have studied it seems average for what the Roman's actually did to prisoners during that time. There is far, far worse on record. It was the point of it all, for Yeshua, Jesus, to suffer in death to atone for the sins of mankind. It goes the same for the history of anti-Semitism generated by past centuries of relatively ignorant peoples looking for any excuse to persecute the Jews. Every Christian on earth owes thanks to the Jews. Yes, they did - according to the scriptures - lead the Christ to a place to be condemned. However, they were only acting as a tool of God. They helped God guarantee fulfilling the inevitable destiny prophesied by the Pentateuch to give the Messiah to humankind. It is, in the final analysis, a Jewish story. All the non-Roman players here are all Jews. It is by, for and about them. Jesus and his followers were all Jews and considered themselves exactly that even after the resurrection. It wasn't until much later when a Turkish rug merchant named Saul came along that Gentiles were invited to join the party.",The Passion of the Christ
213,axismladen,A proof that this movie is in no way anti-semitic!!!,10,2 August 2010,"Passion Of The Christ is most definitely not an anti-semitic movie!!! Unfortunately, whatever Mel Gibson does is called anti-semitic these days. I am not defending him. What he said in 2006 was terrible and he was righteously judged for it. But give a man a break. First off, his not anti-semitic. Ask producer Dean Devlin for instance. He is Jewish, his wife and the rest of his family are Jewish an Mel Gibson and him are one of the best friends. He was publicly defending Mel in 2006. As did Robert Downey Jr. who's brother is Jewish. Also, Mel was going to produce a holocaust movie. That project failed after the scandal that happened in 2006!-------------------------- I am strongly against any kind of racial, religious, national or any other kind of discrimination, so don't think that me defending this movie or Mel has anything to do with me hating Jews or anyone else. I simply think that it in no way hurts anyones believings or anything else. I even read some comments on Braveheart that say that Braveheart is an anti-semitic movie. Come on! If Braveheart is anti-semitic movie than Remember The Titans is a racist movie.-------------------------- Passion Of The Christ has nothing to do with anti-semitism. For instance, there is a scene when Jesus is carrying his cross. He falls and can't carry it alone anymore. Than the soldiers take a man from the crowd, a Jew, to help him carry it. Along the way soldiers are continuing to beat and torture Jesus. However, the Jew that was taken from the crowd drops the cross and threatens soldiers to stop carrying no matter what happens to him unless they stop beating Jesus. Are you telling me that that is anti-semitism? If you are than you don't know what you're talking about. Also when they get to the place where Jesus is gonna get crucified, that same man doesn't wanna leave Jesus. It's not because he believed that he was the son of God or anything like it. Simply because he felt sorry for him. I repeat, this movie has nothing to do with anti-semitism. If this movie has anything to do with it, than the entire Bible does as well.------------------------------ Also, a lot of feminists where saying that this movie is insulting to women because Mel Gibson decided to make The Devil look like a woman. On this one i really have to quote Mel, 'In all other movies Satan is a man. Imagine how men should be offended'! Well said!!! ------------------------------ A lot of Christians claimed to be offended because the movie is too violent. Well, isn't that what you believe in? According to Bible Jesus was terribly brutalized before he was crucified. Allegedly he went through agony and so on, and so on. I can't see what's there to offend you than.------------------------------Once again, don't think of me as some fanatic lunatic just because i'm defending this movie and Mel Gibson. I'm actually more of an agnostic. Also my grand-grandfather and my grand-grandmother were fighting against Nazis in a WW2. So i'm definitely not a Nazi or something. :) ------------------------------All in all, at my opinion Passion Of The Christ is a masterpiece that will be seen in a hundred years from now. One of the best movies in the last twenty years. Simply brilliant! Also the directing and acting were brilliant! I think that there is a lot of politics involved in a fact that Mel wasn't nominated for best director! Also, Jim Caviezel was great as Jesus, Though, i do think that Daniel Day Lewis would have been even better! Anyway, the movie really is a masterpiece of it's kind! Watch it!!! Don't believe everything that people say about it!!! :)",The Passion of the Christ

We allowed our 11 year old to see it in spite of the R rating so she might learn something about our USA Christian heritage.

215,Balthazar-5,"Maybe OK as history, but fairly lame as film",7,26 March 2004,"I used to think that 'The Last Temptation of Christ' was a poor film. But it is shatteringly original compared with this very 'straight' and unadventurous production. Structurally, the flashbacks are really chichéd.Apart from the presence and characterisation of the Devil, it would be difficult to think of a 'flatter' depiction of this most emotive subject. But, perhaps, 'flat' is what such a subject needs. Personally, I am on the squeamish side and wasn't looking forward at all the the much-trumpeted scourging, but I didn't find it gruelling at all. Ergo... I wasn't empathising that much with the Christ character. So maybe the film's very admirable search for historical accuracy has given it 'too much' objectivity.Would I recommend it? To cinephiles, not unless you have no better film to see. To non-Christians, certainly. To Catholics. certainly. To Protestants, certainly, just to understand what Catholics are on about... But these latter recommendations are for philosophical reasons, not aesthetic ones.Finally a note about the translation, which is the one area for real criticism. I found it unbelievable that Jesus talking to God addressed Him as 'you'. It is very clear within the English language that addressing God, the word for 'you' is 'Thou'. (I would be staggered if the German version of the film doesn't refer to 'Du' in this context.)  I can only conclude that Gibson and his team thought that a large part of the audience for the film would be too stupid and illiterate to understand the meaning of 'Thou'. Maybe that was the reason for the 'flat' dramaturgy as well...MikeP.S. Me, I'm agnostic...",The Passion of the Christ

217,Shaolin_Apu,The Maximum Overkill of The Christ?,3,19 July 2007,"When aiming to a historical accuracy that counts every teardrop, sweat and blood is Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ the ultimate work and he makes it go even further. The dialogue is conducted in original antique language and that feature alone lifts a Hollywood movie onto another unsurpassed level. Nothing ever has been more impressive on the silver screen than this movie, but this is also far from being the greatest Biblical movie.That The Passion of the Christ is a movie based on the Gospel gives another challenge: any movie about the Bible will always be either too liberal or too word-to interpretations of the main source, and cynically speaking it seems that it is difficult to make a 'pleasing' Bible dramatization at all. Well, I don't think Passion of the Christ is pleasing but, instead, it is satisfying to the level of ad nauseam. For the manifested impression this movie contains is done by blood, by the blood of an acclaimed historical figure whose name was Jesus of Nazareth, later known as The Christ. The man who became the Christ is portrayed to go through every possible sort of humiliation, like he did really, but I think the portrayal goes too far in the above mentioned ""accuracy"".I don't deny anything that is known and verified about the life of Jesus of Nazareth but I don't believe he had ever survived to carry the cross from loss of blood because of the violence this picture makes him to suffer. The violence in film is too unrealistic, even ridiculous and that is what makes the film 'only' the greatest passion (in the sense of 'suffering') seen in a film, and not really the 'Ultimate Gospel'.",The Passion of the Christ
218,CurtMan@LVCM.com,"Brutal, uncompromising, and necessary",10,3 June 2004,"Mel Gibson's controversial phenomenon, ""The Passion of the Christ"", detailing the final hours of Jesus Christ: his passion, his conviction, and his crucifixion, is the most brutal and uncompromising of accounts, and as a religious message, it succeeds to incredible lengths. We witness Jesus Christ as he practices his passion to spread a message of faith and principle in the final hours before his terrible demise. Intimated of this fate by a vision of Satan, ""Do you really believe that one man can bear the full burden of sin?"", Jesus is soon captured and carried away for a judgment of his people- imprisonment, liberation, or execution. The rest of the film focuses relentlessly, and excruciatingly, on the savage scourging and eventual crucifixion of Jesus Christ, without intermission, without shame, without compromise. If Mel Gibson aspired to horrify those perhaps forgetting of this ultimate sacrifice, then his film has succeeded- egregiously. As a religious testament, perhaps relentless violence in the focus of the crucifixion stands in the way of an entire portrayal of the Lord's savior, and is too excessive to appreciate or absorb. However,I strongly recommend this film as an excellent realization of the sacrifice we should always remember, and carry with us, whenever we feel life has rendered us absolute misery. Jesus Christ: he lived and died for our every horrible sin; as ugly as it might be to watch, this film is very necessary for any religious or moral conviction. ***1/2 out of ****",The Passion of the Christ

220,stevetseitz,"Stunning, staggering, powerful and beautiful",10,28 February 2004,"!SPOILERS! The ""Passion of the Christ"" is simply one of the outstanding films of our age. It transcends genre and re-defines what the motion picture can be. With beautiful cinematography, tour-de-force performances by the entire cast and top notch directing by Mel Gibson, ""Passion"" re-enacts the most important single moment in the history of all mankind.The film is staggeringly powerful with heart rending scenes of extreme human suffering. I do not recommend this film to anyone under around 18 years of age or at least some life experience. To a practicing Roman Catholic like myself it is at once one of the most painful and introspective experiences I've had at a movie theater and one of the most loving and celebratory experiences. The predominant emotion at the end of the picture is extreme gratitude: The feeling of being unconditionally loved. Leaving the theater, I was WORN OUT emotionally.I will now address the issue of violence and Anti-Semitism because it seems to be unfairly tainted reviews both on this board and throughout critics nationwide. The film is extremely explicit in it's portrayal of the suffering of Christ, HOWEVER... to any Catholic who has been through Benediction, the stations of the Cross, or the Gospel reading on Palm Sunday or Good Friday it is nothing new or shocking. Gore, wanton destruction and random brutal violence is nothing new in movies. In fact, it is celebrated (somewhat artfully) in the films of directors such as Sam Peckinpah and Quentin Tarantino. I guess what bothers people the most about violence in this film is that it's on their behalf. There is no innocent party here. This is no normal film where we can sit smug, self- assured and safe, in our ""third person"" reality judging the film solely on aesthetic merits. Even in some of the most violent great films of our day: ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""Braveheart"", we watch everything through a historical lens. We are separated from the action by history, culture, or political climate.
Ironically, here we have a film without a word of english, in a completely foreign culture, about the events in a far land that happened almost 2000 years ago and the violence strikes to our very hearts and souls! Astounding. Bravo, Mr. Gibson.  Jesus was tormented by and for OUR sins and that is what sticks in people's collective craw. Today's jaded and ignorant audiences simply refuse to accept the burden and thus, must whine that the film is too violent.The issue of Anti-Semitism is more difficult. Dennis Prager, a man who I respect highly, said that Jews and Christians are seeing two different films here. Many complain that Mel Gibson overemphasized the Jewish leaders role in the death of Christ. It is historical fact that the religious leaders feared the teachings of Jesus, clearly they saw him as a threat to their control and a blasphemer. Simultaneously, some of these same leaders saw him as a potential spark which could set off the tinderbox that was Jerusalem at the time. Any violent insurgence would have been met with swift and deadly response from superior Roman forces, so the element of self-preservation entered into the equation. Thirdly, there were truly rebellious radicals amongst the Jews who wished to overthrow Roman rule and fight for their freedom. The teachings of Jesus bothered this element also, because he preached things like ""Love thine enemy"" and non-violence. With all of these forces within the Jewish community conspiring against Jesus it is a miracle he lasted as long as he did.  It is clear from the scripture and historical documents that Pontius Pilate at least tried to give Jesus the benefit of the doubt, it was the insistence of the Jewish leaders that led to the brutal flogging and crucifixion of Jesus. It was extremely rare that prisoners were both flogged AND crucified.
Whether the specific individuals in the Jewish religious leadership were culpable for the death of Jesus is without question. Simultaneously, it is an extremely irrational and decidedly non-christian attitude to blame an entire people or race for the act or acts of any specific group of individuals.We must also realize that an Anti-Semite won't be swayed from his ignorant beliefs because he sees a movie. Conversely, a rational intelligent person won't become an Anti-Semite because he sees a movie. Let's take a little more accountability for out own actions, habits and attitudes instead of blaming a piece of celluloid, people.",The Passion of the Christ
221,stevetseitz,"Utterly moving, stupendous and amazing",10,25 February 2004,"Few films I have ever attended have been met with the stunned silence of the entire audience at their conclusion. Fewer require an immediate call to a dear friend after seeing it. Awe, amazement and deep sorrow are emotions I remember feeling during this film. <Note: I wouldn't recommend that anyone under (at least) 17 years of age view this film simply because the viewer needs some life experience to be prepared for it.>Let's address the controversy: Yes, the film is a very violent and realistic depiction of the horrible torture and murder of an innocent man. This is suffering at it's most unbearable and intense agony for long stretches. It is also a historically accurate depiction of the death of a historical figure. To minimize the sacrifice of Christ's passion would be a mistake.In no way is the film ""anti-semitic"", the editing makes it clear that although no human is without sin, the real battle Christ is fighting is against his foe, Satan, an androgenous unsettling figure we see throughout the film.If anything, the film is ""Anti-Roman"" and a stark depiction of the depravity and early decline of the Roman Empire. It's a lesson about how on earth power corrupts.There are several scenes in this film which brought me to tears and I was completely drained after seeing it. Admittedly, I went to the movie theater having just gotten off work, ran some errands and went to the Ash Wednesday service at Church.
SEE THIS FILM!",The Passion of the Christ
222,unakaczynski,Jesus gets the crap beat outta him with glorious cinematography!,9,28 September 2005,"Firstly, we're all well aware of the controversy surrounding this filmnamely, it's accusation that Jews killed Jesus. Well, let's just try to ignore all that for the sake of this review, and look at the film from a motion picture standpoint. I'd just like to point out ahead of time that I was raised, baptized, and confirmed Lutheran, and still managed to find my way straight into science, logic, and atheism. However, I'm actually very interested in religious histories, stories, and the likemuch to the chagrin of my wife, who has little tolerance for my constant viewings of ""Jesus shows"" on the History Channel. Now, onto the movie:This is, of course a story about the hero, prophet, leader, savior, what-have-you of the Christian religion. Not the whole story, however, as this movie focuses primarily on Jesus' final hours on earth. Rather, his final, extremely brutal, agonizing couple of days alive on earth. Here's what the movie does right: Just about everything. Frankly, the cinematography is simply beautiful. The acting is excellentnear as I can figurethe film is done in three languages, Aramaic, Latin, and Yiddish (the language of Jews). I know nothing of these, especially as two of them are now considered dead languagesso the acting in a sense is a tad hard to judge. From what I could tell, it was great and the characters emoted beautifully. The atmosphere is thick as, well, thick as hell. Which is excellent for any filmatmosphere is great, emotion is better expressed through atmosphere. And as it is, so is horror. And this movie seems to take a huge amount of influence from horror films, simply in the agonizing brutality inflicted upon Jesus, and the rampant violence, blood, and gore visible throughout. In that sense, the make-up effects are outstanding, up to par with anything Stan Winston or Tom Savini could pull off. So, no disappointment there. Characters are excellently portrayed, that is when you can tell who the hell they are (get to that in the next paragraph), and the costumes are obviously far better than your average Church-produced Jesus story.Now, here's where the movie fails as a motion picture. Character development is totally absent. I like Mel Gibson and all, but, dammit, he should know better than this. His ego must have told him that everybody must already know the story by heart and he just figured that clearly introducing us to the characters would be a waste of screen time better used whipping the crap out of Jesuswhich takes up, like, 80 or so minutes of this 2 hour film. Now, I'm all for gore and violence, but in a movie this well made, with this much atmosphere and attention to detail (which was also excellent), I'd expect to filled-in a little bit on which one of these middle-eastern dudes is f*ckin Judas. The only characters I accurately figured out were Jesus and Pontius Pilateand I had to confirm him from someone else in the room. Oh, and Barabbaswho was about the only character named more than once, which was great for the whopping 2 minutes he was in the movie. I was forced to go to church and be all little Mr. Christian as a child, and being forced to go caused very little to sink in, and even after dozens of hours with the History Channel, I could've used a little help here. You cannot just have characters running around talking and expect the audience to just assume correctly who the hell they are. Oh, and Satan, I rather figured out who that was as welland the Prince of Darkness was well visualized, as were the few demons seen in the film.That rant aside, the rest of the film was simply fantastic, and after a while, even I started to feel more than a little sorry for Jesus after his constant whoopins. One scene actually showed a chunk of flesh being ripped out of his ribcage, exposing bone for crying out loud! And this isn't a spoiler, it's something to look for because it's actually pretty brief, though nasty. So, that said, ole Mel did succeed in portraying serious emotion through his characters. Or God's characters. Whatever. However, what he did even better was exceed in portraying gratuitous loads of graphic violence, blood, and some gore all over a sacred religious icon. I have a sneaking suspicion that Christian Mr. Gibson is an old fashioned gore-hound. Look at Braveheart, if you disagree. He loves the graphic violence and gore And, apparently, Jesus.Acting: 9/10 (all Aramaic, Latin, Yiddishsubtitled everywhere) Violence/Gore: 8/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 Story: 6/10 (retelling of story that's been told before, nice twist on it, however) Atmosphere: 10/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 3/10 Direction: 9/10Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 1/10Overall: 9/10An excellent film on the points I stated, with an almost total lack of character development.

223,Michael Kenmore,The most hokiest movie to come along in a long time,5,29 February 2004,"I will not debate this film to death, as it's already been overhyped, praised and attacked by the mortal and intelligent walks of life on Earth, but here's my opinion, however embarrassed I'm about to say.In the interest of full disclosure, I'm an agnostic and a rabid socialist liberal with keen interest in cinema as an intellectual simulating art form, world history (Greek, Roman and medieval) and Western philosophy. Having heard the pro and con of opinions regarding the film, always passionate and not so humble, I went to the late night screening the following Saturday after Ash Wednesday. I don't expect parents bring children to see the movie, having heard it's a pretty gory and violent film, but my expectation was dashed. There were less than a dozen children in attendance, so why should it bother me? I saw Natural Born Killers with some kids in the audience when it was released in theaters on the opening weekend.Getting back to the film, I expected it to be a serious film from the beginning. Nicely photographed, well done until the first instance of Judas catching the bag of coins in mid-air in slow motion. From there, it becomes obvious that Mel Gibson makes the repetitive and excess use of slow motion as a sledgehammer approach to giving the audiences the pointers until they understood what goes on. Not to mention appropriating the exact scenes from Braveheart (you know the character's head moving along in the crowd in slo mo). It quickly slides into unintentional self-parody.
Despite the critics raving that The Passion of the Christ is so violent that it should have gotten a NC-17 rating, I must retort: What are you smoking? I didn't cringe or even wince when Jesus got lashed, skewed, nailed and endure suffering, even though I know how truly painful it is to endure the abuse in real life. I've seen worse films with enough realistic gory violence to prompt retching and massive walkouts, particularly the stupendously awful French horror Haute Tension. As an utterly jaded horror fan, the horrific torture sequences didn't repel me while it did for most of the audiences with weak stomach, although I commend good F/X gore effects.Impressive narrative of using the dead languages and Jim Caviezel's spectacular acting as Jesus aside, the film feels light-weight and maudlin courtesy of Mel's ham-handed direction. After the film ends on a corny and not-so-compelling note, I felt underwhelmed giving way to disappointment that the film isn't all that despite the insane amount of hype propelling the film to heated debates and terrific box office bonanza. This is basically a triple-cheese Big Mac Saturday-night Christian movie with a bigger budget for the masses of diverse religious convictions and affiliations which includes the Southern Baptists, the Mormons and the Jews who could care less about the inane protestation from pro-censorship fundamental groups like ADL.When I notice overly artistic and meaningful but awkward scenes that made me want to cringe out of embarrassment at Mel's thick-as-a-ham direction, I make the mental running commentary of Monty Python's gut-bustingly hilarious satire Life of Brian and it made sitting through the movie more bearable by that method. Terrence Malick, himself an Episcopalian, would have directed this film several times better than Mel Gibson's version, however in a radically different context.Sorry Mel, it's not your time to garner more Oscars next year. Well-made strictly in better-than-expected production values and cinematography on a moderately low budget mostly financed by Mel, it's so ham-fisted in flouting subtlety for in-your-face sledgehammer approach with improper and ill-timed indulgence of slow motion that it was too much for me to pay respect demanded by the film.Strangely, the late night screening was occupied by virtually all young people on dates, so I guess The Passion of the Christ is a good date movie when it suits Mel's somberly humorous purpose of making the audience patrons queasy. Just don't expect trying not to argue with a female date upset over gory violence in an R-rated film about the last 12 hours of Christ's life, like I saw the twenty-something young, naive and exceedingly stupid dating couple ripping each other outside the theater as I walk out after the ending credit finishes its roll.",The Passion of the Christ
224,Sparrowmaniac,One of its kind,10,19 June 2005,"Before I even start praising my head off about this movie, I must say that it is truly amazing that Jim Caveizel didn't pick up the Best Actor Oscar for his performance in this movie.He was all Christ. His eyes and his body language was all the acting he needed to fit into the Lord's shoes. Having studied in Christian Missionary School all my life, I know pretty much about the Bible, even though I'm not a Christian myself,but Mel Gibson's portrayal of Christ's last hours of his life is so vivid and unreal that it is shockingly amazing. The visual effects, the camera work, the acting, the make up, cinematography, the music...The list goes on. It is amazing that this is one movie with practically no flaws at all, is so low rated. 7.6, C'mon you guys this movie deserves more.Coming back to the movie, the detailing in every scene is intricately woven. The Crucifixion scene, and the torture scene is so graphic, I remember that the entire theater was filled with shrieks, and some underage guys who spied in fainted, during the torture scene. I liked this movie so much that I watched it no less than 3 times. The first time I went with my cousin, who incidentally was under aged, and after the torture scene he threw up. The next 2 times I went with my friends. Underagers, please note, don't watch this movie because it is extremely graphic, and brutal. Gals in the theater were shrieking and screaming like crazy during the Crucifixion. A Classic in the making, but this must be one of the greatest underrated movie10/10 from me",The Passion of the Christ
225,thewillt08,Sunday Bloody Sunday,3,8 August 2012,"Passion of the Christ, may God have mercy on this review. Passion of the Christ was directed by Mel Gibson and he went all out on this one. I heard this movie was controversial but I never knew why people actually made a big deal about it. Now I know. There is a line in what to and what not to show in a movie and Mel Gibson crossed that line and then some. This movie had many things wrong with it. It's not like I hated it because it was offensive. Sure the Christian church could take offense to this but I personally didn't care. Jesus didn't just get crucified, he got tortured and mutilated. The movie focused more on torturing Jesus than focusing on the story. The poor guy got lashed at over forty times with a whip with hooks like weapons on the end. Most movies cut away and show something else, but this movie shows a continuous shot and the audience sees every lashing. By the end Jesus is a bloody pulp and he can't even move. There is blood everywhere and it is just disturbing to watch. This is all before it is decided that Jesus will be crucified. This was only the beginning and the worst was yet to come. The poor man is bleeding all over his body, open wounds are everywhere, and he has a crown of thorns digging into his head. It's just wrong. That is too much to show on the big screen, but it gets worse. Jesus is then sentenced to be crucified and he has to carry the cross all the way to the hill where he will die. This process takes over thirty minutes and again it focuses on Jesus being beaten and tortured. He falls at least four times and is constantly whipped and beaten. This scene could have easily been cut in half and focused more on why Jesus was being crucified in the first place. Mel Gibson could have made a great film with why Jesus was crucified and how he got to where he was. Instead Gibson focused on blood and disturbing images and didn't care about a story. Everyone who is religious knows the story of Jesus and how he died and why he died but for people who don't, they were possibly very confused as to what was going on. Showing the last supper and Peter pledging his allegiance to Jesus was good, but it was a small segment. Peter feeling so guilty was irrelevant because nobody knew why. Nobody knew the back story, unless they are religious. The twelve disciples were not important to the story at all. They were there but I had no idea who they were or why they were important. I'm not sure how historically or religiously accurate this movie was but I'm pretty sure Peter didn't hang himself because of guilt. That could have happened but it's not likely. Another aspect of uncertainty was when Jesus had his hands nailed to the cross. The hand is all flesh and his hands should have been torn to shreds. The nail would not have supported the hand and it would have failed. Instead they really put the nail in the wrists so he would stay. Finally, I'm not sure if the temple actually got destroyed when Jesus died. It could have but I'm not sure. Did I like the movie? Absolutely not, Mel Gibson didn't care about his story and he only wanted to show the brutality of Jesus' death. The only thing I could have liked about this movie is how it showed how brutal humans can be and what we are capable of. In reality this could have been what actually happened and he has the right to show it. People may hate it but tip my hat to Mel Gibson for doing what he wanted to do knowing he was stretching the boundaries of movies. Gibson always goes into extreme detail and he dragged this movie on way to long but I commend him for putting it in Latin and having English subtitles. That was a detail that people should appreciate. Another positive is that the audience does get emotional during this movie. Weather it's crying or disturbing, this movie made an impact. People had strong feelings towards this movie and maybe that was the goal. I don't think many people actually like this movie but I definitely think it is a movie people need to see. I hated it but I'm glad I saw it. I would never watch it again but it's a movie that should be seen once, and only once. Overall, this movie does not get the WillyT seal of approval, it gets a disturbing. This is a movie not to be taken lightly or for people with a weak stomach. Finally, don't watch it with friends. Watch it alone and pay attention. Friends can become a distraction and since it's not in English, don't do anything else but watch this movie. I give it 3 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
226,pied,A Life-Changing Experience,10,16 January 2005,"As of now, ""The Passion of the Christ"" has made $600 million and has been seen by millions.The film has been out for a while, but I put off seeing it because of the violence. I finally watched it today and was blown away, incredibly moved by this piece of work.Although ""The Passion of the Christ"" deserves to be the best picture of the year, or at least nominated--it won't be.The movie's Christian message is too frightening to Hollywood. Tinsel Town's anti-religious bias is well documented.The acting, the Aramic sub-titles, the direction, scenic casting, music are all first rate. I felt I was there, in first century Rome.I felt every lash of the whip, writhed with each nail pounded into Christ's flesh.Anti-Semitism doesn't exist in this movie. Simon of Cyrene, a Jew who helps carry the cross, is one of the most sympathetic characters. If anything, where is the Italian Anti-Defamation Leaque? The Romans are portrayed as mindlessly, joyfully sadistic. The Jewish Sanhedrin are just corrupt Roman Collaboraters. Most of the Jews are horrified by Jesus' torture and death.""The Passion of the Christ"" is a life-changing, extraordinary movie.It will have a profound effect on the world.",The Passion of the Christ
227,paulo20,The Lashin' of the Christ,1,20 May 2005,"I saw this yesterday, out of curiosity, probably of the morbid variety, I'm almost ashamed to say. But it was made and put out there to be seen and so I saw it. Having seen this piece of blood-soaked propaganda, I'm almost glad I did because, it reaffirms my non-belief (being a lapsed Catholic) in the Christian faith, a result which I'm sure is contrary to Mel Gibson's purpose.Which wa to beat practicing Christians (primarily, Catholics) over the head with a 2-hour guilt trip, at least half of which involves Jesus getting beaten, spat upon, choked, scourged, beaten, spat upon, lashed, beaten and then lashed and beaten; then nailed onto a cross of wood. This will really dig in the message of guilt and just how horribly Jesus died for and because of us. This is basically the basis of the Christian faith, not message of love and peace and all that jive (at least not by the Gospel according to Mel).Anyway, I'm not too knowledgeable about the historical record and how historically correct this film is or isn't, but there are some things that don't make a whole lot of sense in this film (or religion).Pilate, for example, is shown as a humane, almost kindly figure, who doesn't wish to have Jesus crucified (he even has a weepy, sensitive wife who asks him to let Jesus go). At first, he refuses to do so, and instead orders him to be merely chastised instead. Somehow this order (there is even a scroll with orders on it) is interpreted to mean ""please beat and scourge this man to within a centimeter of his life and laugh maniacally while doing so."" We know the punishment order is misinterpreted because, after what seems like a good hour of sadism, Pilate's right-hand man, Abenader, arrives and yells at the torturers for misinterpreting Pilate's orders. Shortly thereafter, Jesus is beaten and spat upon some more, then has a crown of thorns slammed on his head. Later, as the bloodied, ragged figure is made to carry his cross all the way to the crucifixion site, he is punched, kicked, lashed and spat upon every step of the miserable way. Significantly, none of the other ""crucifixees"" are so abused. Abenader swings by on horseback and tells the soldiers to help Jesus carry the cross, then goes off again doing basically nothing else to get the soldiers off Jesus' back because they continue to beat and whip the living $#!+ o out of him (still laughing maniacally). The point here is: Pilate, this supposedly just, humane leader who doesn't want to punish Jesus, apparently has no say on how his underlings treat his charges and is somehow ignorant of how he is punished.Also making little sense is an earlier scene, in which Peter practically goes ""lethal weapon"" on the Jewish soldiers who arrest Jesus, even cutting one soldier's ear off. It takes basically all the soldiers to hold Peter down and he only relents when Jesus tells him ""those who live by the sword, die by the sword...to which Peter could've answered, ""better to die by the sword than to die by the cross,"" but I digress. Strangely, Peter is not arrested and is let off without so much as a slap on the wrist, while Jesus is slapped around while being dragged off. The stranger thing is, later, after witnessing Jesus getting slapped around, this same Peter is accosted by several bystanders who accused of being a disciple, to which Peter shows no sack whatsoever and denies knowing Jesus. First off, why does this matter when he can get away with beating up guards and lopping off ears and second, why the hell should he even be afraid of some bystanders after he just whupped ass? Overall, perhaps to temper the relentless gore, there are some flashback scenes of Jesus relating his messages of love and forgiveness. But is there any forgiveness in the movie? Not so sure about that. Jesus looks at Judas and Peter when they've respectively betrayed and denied him. When Jesus's body is taken down from the cross, Mary holds her son in her lap, then looks, accusingly, at the audience. Yeah, nice message of forgiveness there, Mel.Anyway, this is run on too long (slow day) so I'll just end with the following: Jesus, in a flashback, tells his followers ""love your enemies because if you love only those who love you, where is the reward in that?"" Uh... for starters, you won't get the tar kicked out of you and hung on a cross, maybe?",The Passion of the Christ
228,miken-3,You don't have to be Christian to enjoy this film!,10,24 January 2005,"Based on all the hoopla, positive and negative, I went to this movie thinking I would be bored from knowing the story and disgusted by the violence. I was wrong! Not only does the Aramaic work well and convincing but also the story was ""fresh"" and exciting. Gibson does a super job of directing putting in some very scary scenes such as a snake that appears to come from a demon and having some children turn demonic and attack Judas. As Jesus is beaten by sadistic and unfeeling Romans, the populace look on including his mother. You feel her pain as the torturers flay him to a point that you wonder if he has any skin left. Throughout the beatings there are some very nice flashbacks, showing Jesus in happy times with his mother, making a table for her. The only drawback to the movie is the part when Jesus is made to drag his cross to the crucifixion site. Gibson seemed to drag that part out almost 30 minutes. It is quite interesting that a man is forced to help Jesus carry his cross and the man seems to have more difficulty than Jesus even though Jesus is a bloody mess all over his body. The movie seems to place the main blame on the Jewish priest Kyfus who seems to be obsessed with seeing Jesus die for going against Kyfus's teachings. Kyfus spurs the Jewish crowd to demand that Jesus be crucified. Like anything Biblical, we will never know what is the truth and what is someone's interpretation. And yes, with things like The Da Vinci Code, many people question if any of this story is true. That is up to your own personal beliefs. However, whether you believe or not, Gibson has made a powerful film and by far the best rendition of the story that I have seen and this movie can be enjoyed both by believer and non-believer alike!",The Passion of the Christ

The Passion of the Christ beats it (no pun intended) by leagues. All about this guy name Joe who talks like Kwai Chang Caine (when he talks at all), who has been told he's the son of God and seems to have a great tolerance for pain and blood loss without passing out.This is the sort of film that the Marquis de Sade would have loved. The plot is, here is a guy who thinks he's all mighty. Let's spend two hours beating the crap out of him. Payback with Mel Gibson was a brutal film, but it doesn't compare to this. J.C. is tortured for a good hour of the film. There is blood all over. His body is cut up with lashes from cat-o-nine tails with metal blades at their ends. His eyes are swollen. People constantly spit on him and kick him. But then comes the good part...close-ups of nails being hammered into his palms and into his feet. But, gosh, that wasn't enough. Let's let the crucifix drop face down with J.C. already on it, so that we can bend the nails from the back, so that they won't slip out.The pic is all subtitled. All the actors either speak bad Hebrew or Latin with an Italian accent. Mama mia!

231,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Gratuitous violence does not give it a higher meaning,3,17 February 2013,"I finally got around to seeing Mel Gibson's most controversial movie, and as I expected, I wasn't impressed. The Passion of the Christ is technically admirable. Gibson employs haunting music, expert cinematography, and lets face it, effective use of violence and gore to leave a heavy impact on the audience. Jim Caviezel has Jesus down pat. But the film is devoid of any higher meaning and its self-seriousness lacks entertainment value.Basically, The Passion of the Christ is the story of the crucifixion. Rather than focus on Jesus's teachings, Gibson just gives us two hours of Jesus getting tortured while his mother and Mary Magdalene look on in horror. Occasionally Satan turns up to tempt Jesus and I must say these scenes were especially creepy. I was struck by how genderless Satan looked. I'm not sure if Gibson did this to serve a higher purpose or maybe it's just me. Either way, Satan really looked like he was not from this world.I suppose if you are religious you might find this movie extremely moving but for me it was very boring. It was like the third act of a film extended into a two-hour movie. If you're going to make a movie about Jesus, I don't know why you would only focus on this narrow aspect of his life.I should reveal my bias- I've always found the idea of God sacrificing his son for the sins of humanity to be barbaric. That doesn't sound like a loving God to me, and I guess that's part of the reason I wasn't impressed with this film.Furthermore, the torture scenes were so gruesome I can't believe this movie isn't rated NC-17. I prefer it when directors do not shy away from depicting violence when it is warranted, but this went a little too far for me. Gibson also includes gratuitously violent scenes that serve no purpose- for example, a crow pecks out the eyes of one of the people that was crucified next to Jesus- what was the point of this? Gibson was in a dark place when he made this movie.Finally, I must address the charges of anti-Semitism that plagued this movie's release. I understand where the charges come from but I think they're overblown. The Pharisees are one- dimensional evil bad guys (and so are the Romans, I might add), but there are several good Jewish characters. The man who helps Jesus carry the cross is Jewish. The woman who gives him water is Jewish. Many of the Jews who witness Jesus carrying the cross are horrified by what they see. The High Priests are corrupt, but you can expect that in any religious organization (look at the Vatican). I don't think this film is anti-Semitic.In the end, The Passion of the Christ doesn't really have much to offer except violence, violence, and more violence. I don't think it's particularly ""deep"" or inspiring-it's boring. I'm afraid I don't have anything more to say.",The Passion of the Christ
232,daviddaphneredding,"totally authentic with the ""you-are-there"" feeling",10,3 December 2012,"I, a minister, keep a watchful eye on details connected with given events in the Bible, and I was thus, to say the least, impressed with this movie about the suffering of Jesus on the cross. I bought the DVD of it and have seen it many times, after I saw it three times on the movie screen. It is not a ""pretty movie"", to be sure, but it was realistic in depicting the suffering of the savior and all that led up to that. I was given an adequate idea of the degree of brutality on the parts of the Roman soldiers who beat him like an animal, and the mocking toward Jesus on the parts of Herod and others as well. Because it was authentic, it facilitated the imagining of the state of things from the arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane till the very end of the movie, and the trial by Pontius Pilate in between. And though it was actually filmed in Italy and Morocco, I had no problem imagining the appearance of Jerusalem two millenia ago. The first time I saw the movie in a theater which, that particular night, was packed like sardines, it was indelible and adhesive to my mind, and I left the theater facetiously saying to myself that Jesus did not do that for the human race; but I then totally seriously said to myself that, as the Bible reminds us, Jesus did do that for all members of the human race. To receive an adequate idea of Jesus' last few hours on Earth, and to be given a feeling into the story, this outstanding movie is completely recommendable.",The Passion of the Christ
233,claudecat,doesn't enlighten,1,7 December 2004,"I went to Sunday School as a child, so I know the basics of the crucifixion story, but I had trouble following the ""plot"" of this movie. Half of the characters aren't even named, let alone given any motivations for their actions. The film lacks the simplest contextual information. Why are the temple leaders so anxious to get rid of Jesus? Because they're evil, apparently. Why do the Romans so joyously flog Jesus? In the words of my uncle, ""Because that's what Romans do.""The only scenes that worked for me were some of the ""flashbacks"", especiallywhen Maia Morgenstern, as Mary, was present. (Gibson cast more interestingactresses in this film than most Hollywood types would have.) I wish Gibson had made a movie of Jesus' life and teachings, instead of making his audience suffer through 2 hours of slow-motion whippings, and Jim Caviezel's painful wheezes. I get the impression Gibson thinks it's his job to punish contemporary people for what Christ went through, but don't Christians believe he went through it inorder to save mankind from further punishment?",The Passion of the Christ
234,chribren,Mel Gibson's brutal film about Jesus last day,7,28 August 2013,"Mel Gibson, most known as an actor, has directed a very brutal film called ""The Passion of the Christ"". With a running time of at least two hours, this film focuses heavily on Jesus' last hours and crucifixion, which involved lots of torture as we people know it from the Bible.Not going into the story itself, I can say this film has a lot of violence and gore in it. And for this, this film is not recommended to children at all. The film got rated 15 in Norway, just prohibited to be viewed for minors under this age. Together with people under 15, I don't think I would recommend this film to be viewed for people with weak stomach, mainly because of the graphic and gory violence itself.I watched this film together with my mom and my (now deceased) grandfather at cinema, and I would like to admit that this film was not exactly easy to watch because of the said gory content. But I managed to sit through it.This film, however, was somewhat controversial when the film was new, and caused several discussions about this in many form of media, as well as how Jesus was portrayed in the film. I can even recall about hearing some people talking about ""an Action-version of Jesus' last hours"", which is no surprising for me.Other epic works by actor Mel Gibson include ""Braveheart (1995)"" and ""Apocalypto (2006)"".",The Passion of the Christ
235,wastebot,Clive Barker's Jesus,4,23 March 2004,"Yes, it's Mel Gibson's, but if you didn't know in advance, would have you been able to guess?Ignoring the immense amount of hype surrounding this film, which is worth studying and will no doubt be used more often to promote movies in the future, this is a gothic horror movie.Gibson deserves credit for this.  It's a new approach to an old myth that had become tiresome.  There are plenty of myths and legends that would benefit heavily from such an approach.
It borrows the biblical horror elements of late 60s, early 70s Satan movies like Rosemary's Baby, Excorcist, and Omen (demons, a child Satan, ghosts).  It weaves them into the graphic gore of late 80s, early 90s horror, most significantly the Hellraiser movies.  I doubt this was intentional.  Probably the result of the movies Mel grew up with, enjoyed, and participated in (a little Road Warrior influence is noticeable).Unfortunately, in the end, it's still the same story with the same lame ending.Except for bringing modern horror FX to the crucifixion mythology, there's little new here.  It's kind of like watching a wrestling match where the good guy keeps avoiding a pin for another beating, but never returns a single blow.  The result is tiresome.  It gets to a point in the movie where you just want them to put Jesus on the cross and get it over with.  Gibson should feel lucky that he was forced to shorten it.The soundtrack isn't bad, but not original.  It seems borrowed from the Last Temptation of Christ, and it didn't really fit in that movie either.Finally, because it was such a huge amount of the hype and essentially became one with the movie, a short comment about this film being racist (anti-Jewish).  Impressions will vary from person to person, and my impression is that of a white male that was raised in a Christian home.  To me, the overall impression is that the Romans (the clean-shaven whites) are thoughtful, caring, and obedient and the Jews (the bearded middle-eastern people wearing robes and hoods) are conniving, blood-thirsty, and reckless.",The Passion of the Christ
236,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,W.W.J.D. if he saw Hollywood glorify his torture and his death?,5,3 February 2009,"""The Passion of the Christ"" has indeed sparked much controversy since its release. This review is going to be impartial even though I was born and raised in Christianity. Every film deserves a chance to be watched and I will recommend at least watching this once just as I would recommend any other movie, because it might or might not be someone's cup of tea. But watching it for a second time? Or bringing your children to see this? Well...I have no comment...but there is a reason why it is rated R. Overall, I will give credit to the Cinematography and it's watch-ability.That is with the blood and gore in the torture scenes put aside. Mel Gibson proves to be a good director in a technical way. The acting is powerful and some of the supporting cast does have express a certain degree of morality. The down side of this movie is a heavy one. As I sat through this, I was willing to buy into the message that I thought it would bring. But it was a just a long scene of inhumanity.The drawn out torture scene is very gruesome and a way too excessive. For all you believers and non believers, I ask you this. If theoretically Jesus comes back from the dead, what would he say if he found out Hollywood was glorifying his painful existence prior to his death?Wouldn't he want us to glorify his teachings instead? Other than a few flashbacks in the film, there was not enough exemplification of his ways. I wanted to see Jesus living and teaching others. I wanted to see more of his relationship with his followers. I wanted to see the man who heals and walks on water. But all I saw was that time period of 12 painstaking hours of displeasure, which was overdone on torture. It was like watching Hostel where Jesus was the victim.WWJD? If I were Jesus, I would be upset at Hollywood making money off of me through misleading religious propaganda such as this. I would be very upset at the message it sends out to people. Certainly Mel Gibson got the message wrong, and the audience was affected with the wrong concept. What church or bible did he get the wrong impression of Jesus from?At least, this is from my unbiased point of view. Anyone who reads this, don't take this to heart. I rate this mediocre because though the screenplay was well done, the message is very misguiding and should be watched with viewer discretion. He may have died for our sins, but I think he wanted us to celebrate his life.",The Passion of the Christ
237,Pistol219,Will Never forget opening night at theaters,10,28 October 2019,"Ok so I have always wanted to review on here but this is my first time and for many reasons but mainly on the key issue of pure love and Joy and other words not able to express in any words mainly because silence is all that was at the theaters when i saw this movie.I remember going to this with a close friend of mine I knew from 3rd grade and actually was also an alter boy with. The key moment I will never forget you in my years to come as I am 34 now. Remembering that not only after the movie ended that I was frozen as my friend and looked at other viewers and seems it was unanimous silent. But didn't stop there . Car ride to restaurant was a full 15 minutes silence and only words really said was ordering food. Until finally I broke the silence by simply saying I will never witness another thing the same.So I urge people to put away religion or beliefs and just truly focus on the message. I was born and raised Roman Catholic and I still somewhat practice or should say have un dying love for the Catholic Religion but Not to be confused with it being a religion and Being Christian is my faith. So with that said, please know that We all should view this movie as a look into a mans life and suffering for him only for others. People can say whatever they want to disprove others positive beliefs. Yet we need to see how horrible people can be and also how amazing people can be. Forget Religion and Hate of the Church and open your eyes to see a picture being portrayed of a time in life that was such an impact that it with be immortal in life ti come. After we all return to dust, this life story will remain.I have just as much respect for Jewish, Budists, Islam, Hindu and any other Types of Faith not to be mistaken for religion. But that the real message is Kindness and To realize we are all savages but also are To be kind.This movie portrayed the pain and suffering so that we may not .Godbless everyone and please put aside beliefs and just watch with respect and an open heart",The Passion of the Christ
238,bilahn,"Abhorrent, shockingly immoral",1,2 March 2006,"It is a sad day when families and children are going together to see a film like this - for me it qualifies as child abuse. Mel Gibson has an obsession with violence, and it is a real stretch to turn a few mildly descriptive phrases in the Bible into a virtual snuff film that Roger Ebert has called ""the most violent movie I have ever seen."" It is symptomatic of how great religions today are being refocused into instruments of violence. This movie shows human depravity at its worst, and has us believe it is part of God's plan. You don't have to take my word for it, many devout Christians I know are very disturbed by this film and condemn it. I know Catholics who refuse to see it.It is interesting that I heard a ""sanitized version"" of The Passion was released - and no one came. Violence, like sex, sells.I don't find this movie any more acceptable than the current movie ""Hostel."" There is no question that Mr. Gibson is an extremely talented filmmaker, in terms of style and cinematography this movie is quite astonishing, as is some of the acting.All the more reason to be deeply troubled by this very unsettling movie. That such extreme violence was embraced by a huge number of Americans is very dismaying indeed. I am left incredulous as how so many people are ""shocked and disgusted"" by a beautiful love story like ""Brokeback Mountain"" and yet flock to see this gruesome slasher film, which is basically what it is, and come out ""uplifted.""As a non religious person, I find all of this terribly depressing, but I am not here to bash religion - just religious extremism which I feel this movie represents. I honestly believe any sincere religious person of moderate views will feel the same way and see this as part of the rise of fundamentalism in the world. I feel tempted to raise my rating a little because of the quality of the filmaking, but this movie is so bereft of redeeming morality, I feel I cannot.",The Passion of the Christ
239,danjakubik,"Highly recommended, regardless of one's religious faith",9,8 May 2007,"""The Passion of the Christ"", 2004, Directed by Mel GibsonVery Good ***.5 A mini, capsule review.Regardless of one's religious beliefs, this is a visually stunning and emotional film, simply about the final hours in the life of a condemned man. I was born and raised Catholic, and not a religious person throughout my adult life. As a film buff, I admire how this film's story was told. One can see it in a religious sense or simply the story of the final hours in the life of a condemned man. Cinematography and music score are excellent. The story telling is aided by flashbacks at well chosen moments. I am not religious, yet I was engaged by the simple story and the emotions of the film. A very familiar story is being told here to the world's 1 billion Catholic's. So, exposition is not that important in this case. I best admire and appreciate this film for it's authenticity, visual and musical excellence. Co-written by Mel Gibson and largely an Italian production.",The Passion of the Christ
240,deadsenator,Holy cow. The bloodshed is relentless. - 6 of 10,6,1 March 2004,"I liked this movie, generally speaking, but the blood got a bit distracting. The punishment was so pervasive that I grew immune to it's aim and started not to care.  Blasphemy!  Hey, it's a movie.  Of course, we all know how this story goes, but until now, we've not seen this particular interpretation of it.  I felt the gore overpowered the smaller memory scenes that were scattered about in the film.  I will say that the special effects makeup was very well done.  It also postures itself for the next film (The Resurrection) nicely if they choose to make it.  I don't know if that's a good thing or not.  A moving film that will have you cringing in your seat. All in all, powerful, uncomfortable, and questionable.  I can only go as high as 6 of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
241,arturmachado-29588,The Torture of the Christ,5,22 April 2016,"I feel compelled to write about this movie because I really like biopics and have the uttermost respect for the various religions (even considering myself agnostic), subject matter taken very seriously by a many good people. Knowing it was directed by Mel Gibson I was curious to what he had in store for us, enough for me to go watch it at the theater.What's it about:The last 12 hours of Christ condensed into 2 of beating after beating until the crucifixion in capital graphic detail. And that's it...Verdict:Besides drama, it should also be categorized as horror. If Gibson's intent was for the viewer to capture and feel, in anguish, the suffering and pain the poor bastard went through, well, CONGRATS, he nailed it (literally)! Congrats also to Jim Caviezel for having endured this torture, even if it is only representation. I had to put the popcorn aside 'cause I lost appetite. Thinking I was going to see an account of the good man's life and message and what we have is him being beaten, scratched, wiped, scourged, disfigured, mocked, humiliated, nailed and crucified. There is nothing informative to get here. Nothing. Nevertheless, the remaining technical aspects are absolutely highly detailed, carefully planned and executed, to the point of only using the languages of the time.Not a movie I want to see again. Ever. Once was enough. 5/10.",The Passion of the Christ
242,Sjhm,Profoundly disturbing,4,31 October 2013,"This is a film about faith. And commitment. It's beautifully shot, and Jim Caviezel's performance as Jesus is truly inspired. The use of Aramaic and Latin lends a powerful authenticity to the proceedings, and the events depicted are from the Bible (or certainly from the King James Version which I possess). These are the good points.I was raised a Christian, and as such I have to say that the lengths that the Director goes to in this film horrify me. I have no doubt that Mel Gibson's faith is profound, and his leading man, Jim Caviezel, is known to be a devout man. Truly only a devout man would have had sufficient faith to carry him through making this film. The level of sadism presented in the story goes far beyond the depiction of the last hours of Jesus' life into areas of cruelty which are simply horrific.This is where I have a problem with the film. I have read the Bible, cover to cover. I have a good imagination and I am well versed in matters historical, including all the nasty parts. Frankly there are many crossing points in the movie where depiction turns into voyeuristic sadism. Jesus suffered and died on the cross for mankind's sins. I know that. But there is knowing a thing, understanding a thing, and then having that thing laid out for you in minute and brutal detail. The effect was that I felt deeply uncomfortable with myself for having watched. In the same way that I would feel revolted with myself if I slowed down to view the details of a car crash on the other side of the road.Putting this as simply as I can: a man's torture and death should never be the subject of a film made for entertainment. Not in this way.I would like to give the film many more stars for Jim's performance, and his co-stars but I can't get away from the level of sadistic brutality, I am sorry Mr Gibson, but this was simply too vicious.",The Passion of the Christ
243,wayno-6,VERY Disappointing....,3,26 March 2004,"Well --I saw ""The Passion of the Christ"" last night, with about 10 other souls from my little  trailer park.  Eh...It had no central plot, seemed like disjointed vignettes loosely stitched together, dialogue did NOT always advance plot, music did NOT enhance scenes, (in fact it mostly distracted from the overall effect and seem more like a fish out of water), and it ends abruptly.The movie had an overall low-budget feel to it.  The cinematography was extremely poor -- many dark (LOW LIGHT) scenes - where you couldn't make out any detail at all.Several glaring technical in-accuracies:1.  After Jesus was scourged, women are seen mopping up the blood with towels.  No historical or biblical  basis for that scene.2.  When Jesus carried the cross, he carried the WHOLE cross.  This is NOT biblically or historically accurate.  The weight of the entire cross would be 350 to 400 lbs -- much more than anyone could carry.  They would carry the mantle (cross piece) which weighted between 80 - 100 pounds.3.  During the crucifixion, they drove nails into the palm of his hand. That is also historically inaccurate.  Nails would be driven into the wrist of the hand, because if they use the palm of the hand, there's not much support there, and it would rip out.  Wrist is considered part of the hand.4.  The scene where the crow pecks out the eyes of the thief, is NOT biblically based.  As far as we know, this never occurred.This movie, for all it tries to be, was in honesty, not that well done. I've seen better productions -- like ""Jesus of Nazareth""I emotionally detached from this picture.  I was numb before I saw it, I was numb during it, and I was numb after wards.However, I did NOT feel this movie was NOT anti-Semitic.  While the Jews may have cried ""Crucify him!  Away with him!""  - it was in fact the sin of all of us, that sent Jesus to the cross, to die on our behalf.Wayno",The Passion of the Christ
244,Mitch-25,A great piece of art from any point of view,8,26 February 2004,"This is the type of movie you will either LOVE or HATE.  I as an atheist don't necessarily agree with the entire story.  However, this is not necessary to understand and appreciate this movie.  It is a great story of a man who suffered for all of us (if you go by the Bible). 
One word of warning.  This movie is NOT for young children.  It is absolutely the most brutal movie I have ever seen.  I think the R rating is correct because it lacks ANY swearing or sex (not so much as an ass cheek is shown).  But all the same, it is VERY violent in places.Having said that, I think the brutality adds a lot to the movie.  What happened to Jesus was NOT kind in the slightest.  Nor was it a ""kind"" punishment for the many people who died like this.  The brutality adds a sense of how it felt to actually BE Jesus.  The camera does not shy away from showing the most brutal and bloody parts of the punishment he recieved. However, the brutality is partially abated by the other scenes of Jesus talking to his followers in a few scenes before his capture and punishment. It's clear from the movie and the Bible that Jesus understood that he was supposed to go through this torment.What else to say about this movie?  Well, the acting was very good.  James Caviezel as Jesus was great.  The supporting cast was also very good.  The portrail of the Jews and the Romans was pretty mixed.  There were good Jews (the ordinary people) and bad Jews (the leadership).  As for the Romans, I sort of understood the problem that Pontius Pilate had.  According to the movie, he didn't want to execute Jesus but was forced into it by the Jewish leadership.  I don't know what the real story is (nobody really knows), but I think Gibson took sort of a middle ground with these people.  As for Gibson himself.  I was surprised to hear that he put up his own money to make this movie.  This shows that this story was very important to his.  I also found it kind of enlightening that no major studio backed Gibson.  This shows their true colors.  They do not want stories like this to be made. Fortunately, Gibson was able to find a small distributor (Newmarket Films) that had the balls to put this movie out.  I think that studio will reap HUGE rewards for what it has done.Overall, this is the type of movie that EVERYBODY should see at least once. It's a very important story and a lesson for all of us no matter what your religious convictions.",The Passion of the Christ
245,Mitch-25,Atheist notes,8,12 April 2004,"As a committed atheist, it is often hard for me to watch Biblical movies. Most are VERY idealized versions of Bible stories.  Passion of the Christ is NOT.This is a hard look at the final hours of Christ's life from his capture and torture to his crucifiction.  It is VERY bloody and VERY violent.  Almost the entire movie is a one scene after another showing the extremes that the Romans went to to punish Jesus.  If that were the only thing on the screen, I think it wouldn't be as powerful.  However, innercut between the scenes of extreme violence are flashbacks to happier times when Jesus was teaching his followers.  The way this was done was very simple but very powerful.  I don't know if what is shown on the screen is true, but it IS a powerful story and a VERY powerful way to tell it.It's hard to call this movie ""entertaining.""  It was very well shot, the acting was extremely good and the direction (Mel Gibson) was very well done. However, this is most certainly NOT a movie that is meant to entertain.  It is meant to be a morality tale and an unabashed telling of the last days of Christ's life.  Also, parent should wait till their kids are at least 15 to have them view this movie.  It's probably the most violent movie ever made and certainly the most violent I have ever seen.",The Passion of the Christ
246,miro-6,Do you like horror movies?,2,27 February 2004,"I would like to say first that i was born Christian. Today i don't believe to any religion. I saw this movie for curiosity and because I respect very much Jesus Christ as a philosopher. The movie in itself for me is very superficial and plays a lot around the absurd and exaggerate violence which accompanies all the movie. No man in the world could survive to the 10% of the beating received by Christ in this movie. After the first 10 minutes it starts a cruel and wild torture and it never stops until the end. I guess that only people who love movies like ""Texas chainsaw massacre"" or maybe ""Splatters"" will love in total this ghastly,bloody and full of sadism movie. And more I know that Jewish don't like this movie thinking that this is a movie against them. Romans should be very much more upset,in fact Romans are described really as  beasts. I come from Rome and I guess that Romans were very much more civilized than how people can see in this movie (but that,I guess, everybody knows). I found very stupid the idea to let people talk Aramaic for the entire movie and more let Romans talk a kind of americanized strange Latin language.I have been studying Latin for 8 years and I found this  the only funny thing in the movie. What I can say more. If this was an American movie I could understand the western style but the director is Australian and most of the actors are Italians ( I have been working in Italian movie business for 10 years and I recognized a lot of people I know). My conclusion: an idiot movie very self confident, in the middle between the horror and the western, very cheap and superficial. Jim Cavietzel talks very little but this is a good thing as he is a Ben Affleck style ""actor"". One of the best advertised stupid movie I ever seen.Sorry for my bad English but, as you already understood I'm Italian.",The Passion of the Christ
247,suessis,This is film...,8,29 February 2004,"... not real lifeMel Gibson is an actor, writer, and director. He has made a film that he hopes will communicate to the world his feeling for the subject matter. I believe that he has a achieved that. It is still, however, a film.I have no desire to get into a debate on this site about the religious, social, and political implications of this film. The only thing I want to comment on is whether or not I found this to be a good film. It certainly is an extraordinary piece of work. It is very classically Mel Gibson. There is a great deal of violence, and the lead figure is romanticized in some way. Gibson's Jesus is a truly handsome and fit individual who's women followers seem to be his most loyal.With the exception of James, the disciples are pretty much gone after the first 45 minutes. The film, however, is also powerful and majestic. Even though subtitles are not given to everything I found that I didn't need them to understand the motivations of the characters. The expressions on their faces and their actions did that for me as well as the script. Gibson is trying to push the envelope in film making, and I think it is something that every filmmaker should do. Films should get people to think and have discussions about the subject matter. ""The Passion of the Christ"" has certainly done this.",The Passion of the Christ
248,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of The Passion of the Christ,10,25 February 2004,"What has this country come to when a man can't make a purely inspirational retelling of a story that is the basis of his entire religious beliefs? Has America become a fascist state? Is the United States of America under Communist control? That would appear so with the immense outcry against Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ from the Jewish community who believes this will result in a resurgence of anti-Semitic feelings amongst the movie-going public, a claim that has no justification. Too many people in this country have fallen for the liberal lie of `Separation of Church and State' which does not exist in any shape or form in the United States Constitution. The only thing that comes close to that is the `Establishment Clause' which states that federal government will not choose any religion for the basis of its country nor will it restrict religious freedom. Hmmm . That's funny! Doesn't sound like our country today, now does it? The liberals of this country view Christianity as pot religion, one that can be pushed around and restricted without so much as a peep from the believers. God forbid this film rejuvenates religious moral values in this country!The story, although based mostly on the Bible, has more of an association with ""The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ"" written by St. Anne Catherine Emmerich and St. Mary of Agreda's ""The Mystical City of God"", two sources that Gibson used directly while writing the script for the film. Jesus of Nazareth is known to his followers as a teacher and as the messiah of the Jewish people, whom prophets claimed would come and redeem them from original sin, but to his enemies, namely the Jewish High Priests and the Roman occupiers, he is a religious and political threat. A threat that must be gotten rid of as soon as possible before he creates an uprising, one that has been looming the horizon since the Roman Empire took control many years ago. So in the middle of the night, the High Priests arrest Jesus and in the morning present him to the Roman governor of Palestine, Pilate. Both he and King Herod find nothing to charge the man with but the Jewish people call for the prisoner to be crucified. In an effort to appease the crowd and prevent a riot, Pilate condemns Jesus to death. From there Jesus is forced to march through an angry mob while carrying his cross, nailed to that cross, and to die on that cross only to rise again, according to Christian beliefs, and save mankind from sin. The story for The Passion of the Christ sticks very true to its source, the Bible, and for that Mel Gibson should be praised not only for his accuracy in what he beliefs but also for not appealing to the unrelenting masses crying of anti-Semitism. In what was seen in the film, The Passion is more anti-Italian then anything else. There is no instance anywhere within the film that points directly to anti-Semitism; in fact it is the direct opposite. When the Jewish High Priests meet in the middle of the night to decide what to do with Jesus, two of the High Priests proclaim that the man is innocent and he should be set free but they quickly pushed away by the leader of the group. There are many other such moments that should all but silence the joke-of-a-claim made by Jewish leaders who have no idea what they are arguing against, let alone what is in the film.Instead of focusing on each member of the cast, all of which performed exceptionally well, let's concentrate more on the individual characters the actors and actresses portrayed on screen. Jesus Christ is portrayed in graphic detail through the emotionally driven performance of James Caviezel and the implacable choreograph of Mel Gibson. Jesus is portrayed exactly as he is in the Bible as a man of tremendous power who is beaten down by those who are, in actuality, lower then he is and yet he continues to press forward the message of forgiveness and love, not revenge. Maia Morgenstern conveys such an expressive motherly aura about her that when she performs on screen next to Jim Caviezel, it is utterly heart-wrenching to witness and could bring even the most virile of individuals to tears. Mary Magdalene, performed by Monica Bellucci, is once again misrepresented as a former prostitute whom Jesus saved from being stoned to death, which is a great misinterpretation that even today has gone unchanged. Unfortunately the story about Jesus saving the prostitute comes before Mary Magdalene is officially introduced in the Bible and therefore is often misunderstood. Rosalinda Celentano, who portrays Satan, gives a haunting performance that owes much to Gibson's vision of how he wanted the ruler of Hell to be represented in the film.Overall, The Passion of the Christ is quite possibly the most gut-wrenching, vicious and gore-filled interpretation of Jesus' death but at the same time it is the most emotionally-driven and praiseworthy one as well. The radical liberals and uptight religious leaders may lead many to believe that this adaptation of the gospels will cause anti-Semitic feelings but don't listen to single word they say because it is a flat-out lie! If people leave this feeling angry at the Jews then they have obviously missed the message Gibson and the Bible itself have tried to express, and therefore the filmmakers should not be held responsible for their foolish actions. Others claim that the feature is too violent and, once again, people have missed the point. Any interpretation of the death of Jesus should be graphic and more violent it is, the more expressive the message of forgiveness and love should be. The only problem that could be seen in the feature was the inclusion of children representing demons, which just came off as being a little too awkward to be taken seriously, as well as the too many `jump' moments in the beginning, which came off as being too thriller-ish then anything else. Other then that, The Passion of the Christ is a definite must-see for both Christian and Non-Christians alike. Even if you aren't Christian, you will absolutely embrace the emotionally driven story and it clear-cut message that transcends religious barriers.My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A)",The Passion of the Christ
249,RolloTomasi,NOT NECESSARY,5,10 March 2004,"The four gospels do not go into much detail about Jesus' beating and crucifixion. Mel Gibson expands greatly on John 19:1 (`Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged'). If Pilate really had believed in his innocence, his failure to release Jesus is one of history's greatest failures. The film supposes that he had him whipped in order to calm the crowd, thinking that if the beating were severe enough the crowd might not ask for his execution. Instead, Jesus' flogging (by far the most brutal scene of the film) is added to his crucifixion at a time when a prisoner would suffer either one or the other but not both. Pilate is made to be too humane in his portrayal here. Jesus was handed over to the mob as a form of crowd control. Roman laws forbade the people from executing their own. The Roman officers crucified Jesus under Pilate's orders, so Pilate's `hands clean' claims have always been empty. Crucifixion is a way of punishing insurgents and publicly proclaiming Roman authority over its conquered people. Why did the mob want Jesus crucified? Could it be because he wasn't an insurgent (and Barabbas was) and did not appear to be the king he claimed to be? If he were the king of the Jews, if he were their savior, they wondered, why wasn't he leading his people to freedom? Scripture even seems to show Pilate firing up the crowd to make himself appear less culpable in Jesus' death. `Shall I crucify your king?' he asks them, also from John 19 (but not in the film). Jesus would later pray to God the Father, as he was being crucified, `forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.' (Luke 23:34) Gibson takes many liberties with the gospels, though, expanding the proceedings to fulfill his cinematic vision. Not enough has been said about Gibson's weird idea of Satan, who reminded me too much of the Grim Reaper from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey (a character based, of course, on Death in Bergman's `The Seventh Seal.') nor the demonic children (whose facial transformations is stolen straight from `Devil's Advocate') who torment Judas into hanging himself. If any one thing ruined `The Passion' for me, it has to be these sorts of film school flourishes interwoven into historical events. If the Beelzebub character had been given any thought or imagination I could at least have given Gibson credit for trying. It's as if Gibson had two Passion films in mind, one surreal and one real, and never divorced the two in his mind as he wrote the script and shot it.I'm surprised at how Christian believers have embraced this film. Yes, it does basically endorse the purpose and message of Jesus Christ and (briefly) features his resurrection in the end. To have said, yes we endorse the film. Christians, it's okay to see it because it basically reflects our beliefs' would have been enough. But they wrapped their arms and words around it until it became more than just a film. It had to be an event. In that way, the now-phenomenon of `Passion of the Christ' has become political. Evangelists who previewed rough cuts of the film earlier in the year adopted the film for Christians everywhere, making sure they did not squander the rare opportunity to bring Jesus' message (in the form of a `gift' from a big-name Hollywood star) to the offices, kitchens and living rooms of Christians and non-Christians alike. They made sure that the voice heard loudest about the film was theirs.But here's the thing: it is just a film (and not a very good one). It's one man's vision, which has every right to be expressed. The film's brutality is the rare unique aspect of this latest passion play (as well as the aforementioned pasted-in depiction of Satan and his demons). Otherwise it has nothing new to say about Christ's ministry and message. Unfortunately many Christians have embraced it as an evangelism tool. As a Christian, my hope is that non-believers will want to know more about who Christ was and is, whether they enjoyed the film or not. I cannot recommend anyone see `the Passion,' but do highly recommend its source material.Rating: 5 of 10 Postscript: An Entertainment Weekly reviewer wrote that he thought that Pilate's wife was an invented character. But she's there in the gospels. Matthew 27:19 reads, `While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.'",The Passion of the Christ
250,aeo,A very moving picture....,10,3 March 2004,"I have just watched the movie and I was crying because the movie just touched me very deeply.  I am  an atheist so I do not believe in any religion.  However, aside from the religious overtones, the emotionally wrenching scenes of Jesus' mother's agony as she watches her son being brutally tortured and then crucified, just makes your heartache deeply for her loss.As for all the controversy regarding anti-semiticism, I did not see any but I only have a rudimentary knowledge of the Bible.There has been a great deal of criticism that this  film is too violent but trust me, it is not.  I love violent films; in fact, the more gory and bloody the better.  Kill Bill, Dawn of the Dead, Gladiator, and etc., are far more violent than this movie.  I think many people say this movie is too violent because it depicts a real figure who is considered by many to be the son of their god.  To put it in another way, the violence hits for many, too close to home.The only criticism of the movie is that certain parts could have been more elaborated but again, this movie only depicts the last 12 hours of Jesus.A great film.  I hope this movie gets Oscar nomination and some awards but it probably will not because many academy members will have differing religious opinions or risk aversion to vote for this movie.I really enjoyed this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
251,DVR_Brale,Brutal for a reason: makes you re-examine you faith and reconsider the meaning of a cross,8,16 September 2016,"I never thought I'd say this, but: I'm glad Gibson decided to make this movie so gory. It seems to me Christians are often not aware of how big punishment Jesus took. That leads to trivializing Jesus' cross and His call to take our own cross and follow Him. Cross is heavy and punishment is severe. You can't be a ChrCatholicistian without struggle. Yes, Jesus did suffer tremendously, not only in the night of passion when He was left alone bi His disciples. The Passion of Christ puts a very important question in front of us (at least before faithful): after seeing how severe Jesus' passion was, how likely is that we would've left Him by Himself? This movie made me reconsider my own faithfulness and that's probably everything Gibson wanted.I'm pretty sure non Christians are not able to appreciate this movie as Christians. The Passion of Christ is filled with details of theological significance which are best properly understood together with the Holy Spirit. Take for example Jesus' mother, Marry (Maia Morgenstern). All the time she is suffering tremendously (""Flesh of my flesh... Heart of my heart... My son, let me die with you."") but doesn't take any action; she is not hysterical. She forbears getting involved because she knows there's nothing she can do. Marry accepts her Son's decision ("" My Son... when, where, how... will You choose to be delivered of this? "") and follows Him all the way to the cross. That's why Catholics contemplate Jesus' life with Marry - that is, pray rosary.Than, on the other hand, look at Judas and Peter. Judas betrayed Jesus (""Judas... you betray the Son of Man with a kiss? "") and Peter left him down (""I've never seen Him.""). Judas recognized his sin (""I have sinned, betrayed innocent blood. Take the money back! I don't want it! ) but nevertheless ends his own life by hanging himself. God didn't punish him for what he did; he punished himself. Peter, on the other hand, became a saint. Why so? Because he saw Jesus' face and his forgiving eyes. He knew Jesus forgave him but Judas didn't. This two examples shows that there is a lot more material worth contemplating besides suffering if seen with faith.Cinematography (Oscar nomination), makeup (Oscar nomination) and Jim Caviezel performance are outstanding. Unlike other movies about Jesus life and passion, Gibson's passion takes everything to another level. Passion is depicted extremely violently and realistically and is thus hard to watch. When mentioning how realistic violence is, let me mention that Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin are languages spoken in the movie. Gibson deserves praises for taking this hard route. Language really brings a lot to the general experience.Let me conclude: The Passion of the Christ is made for faithful Christians. Other's may find this movie quaint and nonsensical, but who cares. Don't take into consideration secular critics who have theological problems with it and make fun of Christianity with this movie as an instrument. Watch it with eager desire to deepen and re-examine your faith. If this movie makes you pick up your Bible again or makes you reconsider going to church again or makes you appreciate more Jesus' suffering and price He paid for us, than you've seen is it as Gibson wanted you to see it.",The Passion of the Christ
252,charlessmith702210,This is the most shocking--yet most effective--of the Passion movies,10,7 April 2007,"Perhaps this was the most gory movie Mel Gibson ever directed. It even surpasses ""Braveheart"", in which Mel not only directed, but also acted as character Sir William Wallace. It was like Jesus was the new William Wallace, but to Christians, this ""William Wallace"" was attempting to deliver a prophecy, where Jesus was going to be handed over to the priests of the temple, betrayed, arrested, mocked, scourged, condemned, and finally, crucified in Golgotha---and on the third day, be risen again.The flashbacks of Mary Magdalene, and another Mary Magdalene, which represented Satan, were almost overblown to the point that it lagged some parts of the movie. There was an understanding of that Satan when Jesus was crucified, when Satan disappeared when the temple broke in two. Other flashbacks that took place, especially after Jesus's arrest, were good enough....especially the flashback where a woman, who was about to be stoned to death for being caught for adultery, blesses Jesus when the stone throwers dropped their stones and went away.The part when Jesus was scourged resembled almost that in the movie ""Jesus Christ Superstar""...at the beginning. Like both movies, the counts during the scourging are yelled out, although in different languages. He was whipped about 25 stripes, with cat-o-nine tails, before I thought it was all over for Jesus with the whipping.Then, in probably in a sort of lust that Jesus was the Messiah, the two scourgers did a about-face to hurt Jesus even further--by whipping him with cat-o-nine tails laced with nails. I think a total of 100 lashes occurred with this new torture...before the scourgers were ordered to stop.After the scourging was all over, you see Jesus's blood all over his body. It was like as if Jesus was immersed into a bath containing hundreds of crowns of thorns, or thrown into a bed of nails several times.Such torture from Jesus's scourging had never been found in most other Passion movies, although some show you the crown of thorns and of course Jesus's hanging from his crucifixion.And unlike other Passion movies, the lust for Jesus's death in ""The Passion of The Christ"" came even as he let his head fall forward, and his face never goes up again...signaling the end of Jesus's life. One of the guards who saw Jesus on the cross, who realized that the temple's veil in Jerusalem was split in two, decides to pierce Jesus's chest with a spear even though he was truly dead. As the blood gushes out of the chest for the final time, that part was the most shocking part of the movie I had ever seen.",The Passion of the Christ
253,chiguy17,Speechless,10,13 April 2020,"I grew up in the church and know the story well, but seeing it laid out like this... I was touched beyond expectation. Literally brought tears to my eyes.

254,teejayniles2345,Flawed epic is Blood-fest and visually hammering !,7,9 April 2004,"First of all, this film is not for the squeamish nor the uninformed as far as the history that underlies the somewhat oversimplifying ""harmonization"" approach to this sad part of world history.  I ranked this major film of 2004 as a ""7"" and that's unusually low for me as far as movies that I had so much anticipation and had heard from many who were emotionally satisfied by. It is, however, quite oddly anti-Semitic even as it makes the cultural context so essential, given that the major languages of the time and place (Hebrew, Aramaic, Latin) are what the film dialogue is conveyed in.  I have seen over much of my life such ""PASSION plays and skits,"" both good and bad, but I found this one oddly visceral and bloody for special-effect pizazz sake.  I just don't understand what's happening with its extended VIA DOLOROSA segments, the good soldier-bad soldier politicking, and special effect-loaded punch as the dead Jesus is taken down from the cross in a thunderstorm by sympathetic Romans who all have sympathy for Mother Mary. The Satanic scenes are slo-mo for bad purposes in my opinion.  The macho fight scene in the Garden Gethsemane did work, however; the Malchus (ear-cut off) healing episode was effectively reminiscent of other similar epics like THE_ROBE, BEN-HUR, etc. The diverging sorts of flashbacks and Jesus POV shots felt out-of-place since the film attempts to convey again and again the intense physical suffering and spiritual struggle with an unearthly Satan-figure.   What an odd blend of Middle-Eastern music soundtrack and loud, loud looping of dialogue only partly subtitled!  I believe this may be better in a DVD format when you can alter some of that distraction from the sometimes quite effective flashbacks.  I do wish that the make-up was more consistent as far as making the Jerusalemites more uniformly dark-toned than sometimes all-too Italian.  I also found it strange, strange, and hateful that Herod came across as the quintessential fop with a ""bad wig"" and sissy attributes.  Mel Gibson knew about the villainous ""fall guys"" and resisted assigning much to blame Pilate for [which is historically untenuous]. Again this film is NOT for everyone; only mature 17+ year olds and people who have their emotions under control.",The Passion of the Christ
255,FilmLabRat,Profound and Unique,8,27 February 2004,"This rendition of Christ's life is unique in many ways - as most people have heard from the incessant media coverage.  Besides being centered on Jesus' last 12 hours (plus 12 brief flashback segments interspersed), the depiction emphasizes the clash between good and evil, sacraments and the courage in the face of suffering more than I expected (from the dozens of film clips I had seen on TV).  Very bloody 9-minute scourging scene and emotionally high-pitched throughout yet presented with amazing artistry and contrasts. While I found it slow in some places and too black and white, in trying to show the extent of Christ's suffering, Mel Gibson succeeded brilliantly. Truly one of a kind and a much to be admired oeuvre.",The Passion of the Christ
256,marcosaguado,Once In A Lifetime,10,18 March 2004,"You may have an experience like this in a movie theater, once in a lifetime. I haven't been able to take those images out of my mind. What an incredible achievement. It works in so many different levels that it would be impossible to list them. It touched me in a way no film has done before. It provoked such degree of hatred around my neck of the woods, that it goes to prove how the devil reacts to holy water. Most people I spoke to in Los Angeles had made up their minds about the film before actually seeing it. What's that all about? At the end of the day Mel Gibson had the last laugh or the right to have it, although I don't believe that he is laughing. He seems to be unafraid, fueled by his faith and convictions, a man of his word. That in itself must confuse the hell out of Hollywood. All religious considerations to one side this is an artistic masterpiece. You may agree or disagree, but why not to make up your own mind?",The Passion of the Christ
257,GHCool,This Film Bothered Me,1,6 March 2004,"Before I tell you what I thought of the film, keep in mind that these comments are ONLY ABOUT THE FILM and not about Christianity or Jesus himself.  As a Jew, it is my belief that Jesus was not the Son of God and even if he were, I don't understand how his suffering and death has anything to do with the sins of humanity.  That is my belief and I saw this film from that point of view.  Some (if not most) of my best friends are Christian and I have a tremendous amount of respect for the Christian faith and the teachings of the New Testament.  So I repeat, any and all criticisms I make in this e-mail are ONLY about the film and filmmakers and not about religion.That being said, THE PASSION is my early vote for the worst film of the year.  I had high hopes for this movie because it was getting so much word of mouth and because a lot of people I respect praised it as a profoundly moving experience.  I was completely unmoved by everything that happened on the screen.  I guess I felt sorry for Jesus, but only because I wouldn't have wanted to be in his shoes.The first, and probably the largest, problem was the story structure.  The movie was basically divided into two halves pretty evenly.  The first half was about how the Jews of that time and place were responsible for Jesus' death.  The second half was about how brutal Jesus' torture and death was.The first half is the half that Jewish leaders have unwisely been protesting for months.  My feeling is that if they had not put PASSION in the spotlight of the media, this movie would have opened in limited release and disappeared without anyone knowing about it.  I have not read the Gospels and know very little about the New Testament.  What I gathered from THE PASSION is that Jesus was condemned to death by Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest, because he claimed to be the Son of God.  After Caiaphas and his evil Jewish henchmen beat up Jesus, they take him to Pontius Pilate who takes a look at him and says that blasphemy is not a punishable crime. Caiaphas and the other Jews vehemently protest and, after considerable thought, Pilate agrees to whip Jesus.  As Jesus is being whipped, Caiaphas and the Jews cheer and the Devil walks among them.  It is clear in these shots that the Devil and the Jews share the same satisfaction out of Jesus' suffering.  After Jesus is totally scarred and bloody, Pilate shows Jesus' body to the Jews and asks, `Isn't this enough?' The Jews demand that it is not enough and Pilate reluctantly condemns him to crucifixion.Whether or not Mel Gibson and his family are anti-Semites is not something I know or care about.  THE PASSION, however, is a film that has anti-Semitic themes in it.  There is no doubt in my mind about this.  The problem with the film's structure is that it begins at the end of the story.  There is no context for Jesus' life and setting.  The Jewish high priests look, dress, and act as though they are minions of Sarumon from LORD OF THE RINGS. There seems to be no reason why Caiaphas and the Jews are so cruel.  They are just cardboard cutouts of `bad guys.' When Jesus is on the crucifix and says the line `Forgive them for they know not what they do' he looks directly at Caiaphas who is smiling at the wonderful sight of Jesus' torture.  Time elapses from day to night as Jesus is on the cross, and yet Caiaphas stays there for the entire time! Doesn't the high priest have other things to do or does he take so much pleasure in Jesus' torture that he wouldn't want to miss a minute of it? Even if he didn't have other things to do, doesn't he know that as a high priest, Jewish law forbids him to be at a place of death?That was another problem with the movie.  None of the characters had any emotional depth except Pilate; the only character in the story that historians say did not have any emotional depth whatsoever.  Jesus might as well have been played by a crash dummy since he is given nothing to do except get beaten up.  And Mary and Mary Magdalene are given nothing to do except cry during reaction shots of Jesus' torture.",The Passion of the Christ
258,Clothahump,"Not quite a total waste of money and time, but close",5,9 March 2004,"Sorry, folks.  This is a bad movie.I realize the Christians will immediately denounce me as Satan-spawn for saying it, but this is nothing more than a two hour movie of someone having the snot beaten out of him.  To give Gibson credit, he did follow the mythology closely.  However, his movie makes the assumption that you know the story.  There is no development of the character of Jesus as the demigod he's supposed to have been, other than the healing scene when he's taken prisoner.I'm no longer Christian, but when I was raised in the Christian faith, I was taught that the important part of the story was the resurrection, not the suffering.  Gibson relegates that to about 30 seconds at the end.Again, this movie is just violence for violence sake.  Gibson could have let the audience imagine it and it would have been much more effective, kinda like the shower scene in Psycho.  Instead, his dwelling on the blood splashing everywhere really detracts from the movie.  If this movie gets nominated for Best Picture, the producers of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the Halloween/Friday the 13th flicks should sue, because PotC is right on par with them.",The Passion of the Christ
259,comquest,The Gospel According to Mel,1,26 February 2004,"Mel Gibson's ""Passion"" is among the worst films ever made. 
By isolating the death of Jesus Christ into a stand-alone event -- completely out of context -- the movie portrays Christianity as a religion that was born out of hate, violence, death and fear.  If humanity were truly as mindlessly brutal as depicted by Gibson, then a loving God would have destroyed - not saved - such a pathetic species and frogs would rule the world.Furthermore, it is deliberately anti-Semitic.  Gibson's hand-picked version of the Gospel lets Pontius Pilate off the hook, and places the blame for Jesus' murder squarely on the raving hordes of Jews.  An accident?  I think not, since this is a theory that follows Gibson's personal beliefs.In recent interviews, Gibson talked about his brand of Traditionalist Catholicism, a fringe religion which does not accept the Second Vatican Council's 1965 rulings on various subjects including responsibility for the death of Jesus.  Traditionalist Catholics view the Second Vatican Council as a conspiracy between Jews and Masons to take over the Catholic Church. Gibson is such a devout follower of this faith, he has already invested over $5 million to build a Traditionalist Catholic church in Agoura Hill, Calif. Profits from The Passion will, no doubt, find their way into Mel's construction coffers.Lastly, the degree of graphic violence portrayed in the film - and its unrelenting length (over 45 minutes) - is way over-the-top.  This appears to be Gibson's attempt to shock the flocks of Christians into accepting his personalized version of the Passion.  It's just too bad that Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwartzenegger could not have been cast in this Ramboesque gorefest.  Thanks for the effort Mel, but Cecil B. DeMille you're not and I prefer to draw my own interpretations from the Bible and historical sources.",The Passion of the Christ

261,gerry-russell-139,A pulverizing account of His sacrifice that has shaken the world and changed forever the face of modern cinema,10,3 September 2004,"Some say Mel went too far with this film but in truth, Christ was beaten beyond recognition... his torso was so deeply cut into that you could see his lungs breathing, it was that intense. Jim Caviezel's portrayal was so real that the Academy should damn well give him a nomination next year... that's one thing about releasing a film really early on in the year: the Academy voters don't really have much remembrance prior to the big summer releases. But I really think Mel and the picture itself (plus the incredible cinematography, the sound, the score, the editing and the makeup) will all be given a nod come January. A word of advice, this film is not for the faint of heart or ones who can't stand the sight of blood. It's a very brutal depiction in terms of the violence but it's good that this film was made and that it's received so much success at the box office. On it's first day of release on DVD it sold 2.4 million copies on the east coast by noon, alone. That's certainly saying something about what Mel has done. Controversy aside, THE PASSION OF THE Christ will go on to become a great epic over time and people will remember it with more reverence than disdain over how brutal it is.Much of the scenes/character development was very clever, too. For instance, Satan had taken on the form of a woman (a very pale, sickly looking one without hair) who at one point in the film carries a baby in her arms while looking on as Christ is tortured. She uncovers the child's back to reveal it to be a ghastly midget with back hair and it turns to look at Christ with a very beastly grin and a vengeful glimmer in its eye. Another fine conception is of Judas being relentlessly taunted by a large number of children who are really Satan's minions (demons) who chase him beyond the city with Satan among them watching their vicious game and gleefully awaiting the fateful result: Judas committing suicide.Mel's film is really due all the praise and award recognition in the world. It's a lasting tribute to the deeply painful yet ultimately redeeming truth of what one Man went through to save all humanity.",The Passion of the Christ
262,byrann_gowan,"Dear God, I pray for your mercy...",8,10 December 2011,"... I pray for your mercy on me Lord. This movie has shown me the brutality of Your Son's crucifixion. I am speechless, Lord; I am speechless, because it is a truly awe-inspiring thing when someone who loves you just as much as Jesus does wants to save you from eternal damnation. Thank you Lord. Amen.In order for this review to work, I had to start out with a prayer. That's the first sign of how much I love this movie.The thing that I loved the most of this movie was the fact that, to me, it was the closest portrayal of Jesus' crucifixion I've ever seen. I've heard complaints that the film is too gory and too violent, but what those people need to realize is that Jesus' crucifixion was anything but non-gory and non-violent. I'm sure that even non-believers know the story of Christ's crucifixion, and if they think that Mel Gibson should have layered down on the blood, then they should be watching ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" not this movie. I'm not saying that I loved watching the gory scenes; in fact, I hated watching them, especially the whipping scene, and the hammering of the nails. But, the fact that these scenes were in there just solidifies how true to the story this really is. And I thank Mel Gibson for that.Also, I liked how Mel Gibson decided to incorporate certain things into this movie that weren't in the Bible. The reason why was because they were appropriate things, and most of them had to do with the devil. We see the devil at Jesus' torture, and at his crucifixion, and we see these ""devil-kids"" along with the devil himself torturing Judas. I liked these scenes, because it shows how much the devil has influence on us. The devil can influence us to do evil things, like trade a friend for money, or put somebody to death. Kudos again goes to Gibson for that.Finally, the acting. Everybody did a really good job here. Caviezel was the best person to play Jesus, and I applaud him for taking on such a momentous role. It will never come true to the real thing, but it was still a good job. Everybody else was great too (unfortunately, I don't know their real names, so I'll just use the characters): Judas was great as someone who deals with the consequences of selling his own friend to His death. Peter was great, especially in the denial sequence. Mary, John, Mary Magdalene were all great. The person who played the devil was truly chilling. Great job to everybody.Overall, this film was really well done. I don't know why some people complain about it; if it's just too gory, go watch ""The Life of Brian."" Get a laugh out of that. This, however, is the real deal, and Gibson definitely had God's help in this film. A 10/10 for me. God bless.",The Passion of the Christ

THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST was not an entertaining kind of film; certainly not a ""popcorn movie"". It was one of the most gripping films ever made.As a Christian, it served to remind me of the price Jesus paid for the sins of mankind; more personally, for my sins. Never has a film so graphically depicted the suffering of Christ. Whether you,re a Believer or not, I highly recommend seeing it.

Even with that aside, this is just a great movie.This movie takes risks that many modern day movies never take. Mel Gibson uses some really cool first person camera angles so that you can see what Jesus saw.If you have in love in your heart at all for Jesus this movie will have you crying.  The scene in which the guards whip Jesus is one the most riveting moments that I have ever seen in a movie. The only thing that compares to that is in Schindler's list when you find out that the child who wore the red jacket was killed.  I guess it is ironic that I compare it to a movie based on the suffering of the Jews.This movie is not anti-semitic. Those who were quick to make that assesment has never studied the Gospels of Jesus.  I must agree with the Pope when he said ""It is as it was.""Satan in this movie is portrayed as women and children, that is a interesting spin on the innocence of evil.This is the only movie that I have evered reviewed in which everyone already knows the ending.

265,dj_xand325,"A passionate, harrowing, barbaric and daring adaptation of Jesus' last hours... A masterpiece of cinematographic art",9,28 February 2008,"The Passion of the Christ is a film directed by Mel Gibson which follows the final hours of Jesus. It begins with one of Jesus' disciples Judas betraying Jesus and telling the Jews where he is. The film then leads on to the arresting of Jesus and his torture and condemnation ensue.This is an extremely graphic film that features Jesus' last hours exactly how it happened. Jesus is whipped, tortured, spat at and verbally assaulted. The film is filled with hatred but its also filled with love. While Jesus is being crucified he is praying to God to forgive his torturers for they are not knowing of what they are doing.This inclusion of love in a seamingly bleak situation makes the film relentlessly powerful to the viewer. So much hatred is being done to Jesus yet he still finds a place in his heart for forgiveness.Mel Gibson didn't put the excessive violence in the film for the sake of it, he used the violence to his advantage to increase the power because after all, this actually happened, its all true.The film is riddled with exceptional cinematography (which earned it an Oscar nomination) that produces imagery of the finest standard. A personal favourite camera angle is the one through the rain drop near the end of the film. The transition of the angle was smooth and somewhat disorientating which therefore, relates to the situation.Gibson also uses flash backs to his advantage in increasing power, he manages to create cinematographic and situational juxtapositions with subtle flashbacks. An example i could think of this is, when Jesus is being aggressively arrested and there is a flash-back of Jesus happily at home with his mother Mary. Not only is the lighting juxtaposed ,the mood of the situation is juxtaposed. Gibson manages to juggle with the viewers emotions. Although, this makes the film very difficult to watch (alongside the graphic violence), it makes the film a work of art.We are in a time of philosophical confusion and this thought-provoking film presents an insight of a theological solution to our existence.This film was difficult to watch yet i couldn't stand not to.Praise is owed to Gibson 8.7/10",The Passion of the Christ
266,tbabe29,Decent Movie - But the Book is BETTER!,8,27 February 2004,"After the hype over this movie began to die down, I finally saw it tonight.It's pretty good.  I had been going over the four gospels again, to make sure they were fresh in my memory.  After seeing this movie, it makes me want to read my bible more.  And that's a good thing.This is not a perfect movie.  There are some discrepancies (that I will address in a minute).  But I think the point Mel Gibson was trying to do was to get audiences to engage in dialogue about spiritual things- and he has succeeded.This movie will plant a seed in some people and create a spiritual fervor and spark.  But it will not answer all your questions.  But it may encourage you to read the Bible, and the Bible will satisfy alot more than this movie.And now for my questions:Mary Magdalene- Um, where in the bible does it say that she was the woman who was caught in adultery?  It says she was a woman ""out of whom had come seven demons"" (Luke 8:2)   Where as the woman who was caught in adultery in the movie flashback (although this is not obvious to people who don't know the scriptures) is not named in the Bible.(John 8:3-11)Where is Pilate's wife in the Bible? Someone told me she is in there, but I am still looking.Mary & John took Jesus down off the cross in the movie, but in the bible it says:""When Jesus therefore saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, ""Woman behold your son!""  Then He said to the disciple ""Behold your mother!"" And from that hour THAT DISCIPLE TOOK HER TO HIS OWN HOME.   (John 19:26-27)THEN Jesus said ""I thirst"" and THEN He gave up His Spirit.  Later on Joseph of Arimathea took away Jesus' body. (John 19:28-38)One last thing:Someone said that the gospels were in Greek only, but my bible says in John 19:19-20  ""Now Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was:  JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS""""Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in HEBREW, GREEK AND LATIN."" ----- okay enough of that.Good movie, but the BOOK IS BETTER! 8/10",The Passion of the Christ
267,PaulLondon,You can take the Gibson out of Hollywood,5,10 November 2004,"But you can't take the Hollywood out of GibsonSurrounded by controversy it came as quite a surprise to find out just how ordinary this film really is. Certainly the violence is distressing and there are a couple of beautifully acted and moving moments. In many ways I'd have liked to be able to say that this is a good film, but I can'tSo what is wrong with this film? Well, Mel Gibson. Although there is no doubting his sincerity in making this film it does demonstrate his limitations as an artist. His decision to have the film subtitled demonstrates his striving for authenticity; so, how to explain the 'Golden Turkey Awards'esque moment where Mary and he laugh about the table he has built or the addition of a few hissing demons to spice up the non violent moments? He also wants us to know who is GOOD and who is BAD. There is no room for moral ambiguity in this film; hence, Pilate, a victim of political machinations and Herod, a laughably sybaritic decadent who is obviously a BAD man. By the end of the film I felt bludgeoned; not by the violence, but by the stereotypes that Gibson parades for our entertainment and by his desire to make sure that this is a Hollywood film despite all of its pretensions to being ART",The Passion of the Christ
268,mercury4,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time,10,13 August 2004,"When I saw The Passion of the Christ I didn't know what to expect. I heard many things about this movie, but no matter what I heard I wanted to see for myself. I went into the packed theater and I saw one great movie. This movie is definitely without a doubt the best movie I've seen in a long time. This movie will probably be the highest grossing one too. It deserves every dollar it's getting. When I saw Mel Gibson's name involved I knew from the start I wouldn't be disappointed. 	When the movie starts out you know it's going to be in another language. Many people have said it's in Latin, but in fact it's in Aramaic. The film moves right along and it starts with a man praying and asking God to protect him. This man seems very frightened. When you get a good look at his face you know right away from the great makeup and costuming to this movie that it is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is phenomenally played by Jim Caviezel. In The Passion of the Christ Caviezel doesn't just play Jesus, he becomes him. When I first heard that Jim Caviezel was playing Jesus I was a little unsatisfied. I never saw him in anything before that impressed me. But after seeing him in this, there is no doubt in my mind that he has some real talent. Surprisingly the leading man to this movie isn't getting any attention. In the 1961 movie King of Kings, Jeffrey Hunter was given a lot of attention. All eyes were on him, not for his performance, which I thought was very good, but for his youthful age. People at the time unfairly called the movie I Was A Teenage Jesus. Anyone who can say this movie is just like any other biblical picture is very wrong. This movie is like no other film put on screen. 	After Jesus is arrested his life starts to change for the worst. He is spit on and beaten, but he goes on and he refuses to yield to the High Priests. People complain that this movie doesn't go into the miracles of Christ, but that really isn't what the movie is all about. When people see the word passion they think of romance. This movie has nothing to do with romance. This movie has to do with the suffering Jesus went through. It is about the pain he went through. The best part about this movie is that you feel as if you're right beside him for every last minute of his life. When he is being tempted by Satan, you're with him. When he is betrayed, you're with him. When he is brutally scourged, you're with him. When he is condemned, you're with him. When he is finally crucified, you're with him. During the crucifixion scene while he carries the heavy cross that he will be nailed to, the camera is so close that you feel like Simon of Sirene, the man that helped him carry it. One of the many touching scenes of this movie is when the Virgin Mary rushes to her dying son's side. The whole time Jesus is suffering you can see a look on his face that's saying, `I have to go through with this.' When he is placed on the cross to be nailed you are feeling exactly what he is feeling, fear. There is one shot of Jesus on the cross that makes you feel as if you're up there with him. While he is up there forgiving his enemies and telling a sorry criminal that he will be with him in paradise, you can't help but feel very sad. When Jesus finally does commend his spirit you feel exactly how the Romans are feeling, `Truly this man was the Son of God.' 	 	This is a great movie that I highly recommend to all. I think that Mel Gibson is a brave man for making this quintessential movie. If you want a strong story, genuine acting, and amazing directing, then this is the movie for you. Passion of the Christ deserved every dollar it made and next year this movie should win many Academy Awards. People say that this movie does not change your feelings about religion. I would have to disagree with that because this movie is a great religious experience. I also agree that Catholic schools should go to see this. This movie is violent, but it is also true. The violence does not ruin the movie, but it gives it more strength and accuracy. Kids in Catholic schools have been reading about this. I think it is time they saw the whole story and the whole truth. Years from now this movie will be remembered and it will live on as a classic.",The Passion of the Christ

270,thehardyboyz2043,It's a labor of something all right....,4,4 March 2004,"(Possible Spoilers) Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" has been called a labor of love, among other things. Well it probably is and I applaud Gibson for having the guts to produce a film about such a touchy subject.  Well, personally I don't care how accurate this film is, I found it boring. I don't see that as an attack on the movie's subject matter so much as the film itself. It is just a movie after all, Gibson's interpretation of the events. I don't know how these events go, I haven't read the bible since I was 8 and I won't again, if I have anything to say about it, so I'm not an expert, nor do I plan to be, but I just found this film boring. The acting by Jim Caviezel as Jesus was good, as was Maia Morgenstern as Mary. The cinematography is excellent, but the pacing movies like a snail stuck in molasses, the film itself seems to go on forever and the much talked about brutality, is nothing to write home about, there a couple of cringing moments, but overall not that brutal.  I'd like to close by saying that I work at a movie theatre and I've received some backlash, first for not seeing the film, then stating my opinion on it. I don't see why personally, I'm not attacking the bible, or the beliefs, just the film and that's what it is just a film, nothing more nothing less. *1/2 stars",The Passion of the Christ
271,Yiannis_Galidakis,Emotionally powerful and moving,10,10 October 2020,"Mel Gibson on orgasm with this. Indeed quite a moving emotional experience. Excellent cast and powerful interpretation with Kaviezel, who masterfully portrays the more gentle and peaceful but optimistic side of Jesus - there's a YouTube video of him talking about some of the details in the movie and some personal testimony as it relates to this movie. The violence is graphic and a bit on the overdone side, but that's just my opinion. I searched online whether such violence was historically justified, but I couldn't find anything away from the NT texts, so this leads me to think that there is a bit of hyperbole with the portrayal of the incessant beating. Particularly as it relates to all this skin tearing. Otherwise, it looks fairly accurate in terms of what's to be found in the NT. Excluding some of the little ridiculous bits and pieces, here and there, such as the appearance of Satan as a no-gender-specific freak carrying a monstrous baby in his/her arms, overall quite a moving experience. I did cry and was overwhelmed by emotions of sympathy like many other people when they saw this. I suspect because my background is Christian, but in the long run it doesn't matter, whether you are one or not: The visuals are so powerful than any reasonable sympathetic will respond likewise. The cinematography is terrific, the dialogs are taken line for line out of the NT texts - with some notable exceptions such as the dialog with Pilate and the overall atmosphere is right. The resurrection scene is uneccesary, really. One gets the powerful message regardless - guess that's Gibson's personally added note to Jesus' message as a believer. So is the ""metaphysical"" scene, related to God's ""view"" of the Crucifixion. Excellent portrayal of the confusion and terror after Jesus' betrayal and the weakness of Peter. The narrative is well balanced with appropriate time cuts and regressions which add to the tension. A much better script than Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth TV mini-series, which is relayed traditionally here every Easter and which is too emotionally bland for serious consideration. Prefer to be bombarded and bent by emotion than having an emotionally ""cool"" and neutral Jesus who simply plays along scripture text. But as far as my overall impression is concerned, i'd classify it as horror really, rather than as drama. Gibson took special measures to exemplify this using visual violence: Kids & sensitive people shouldn't be watching this, because one may eventually grow VERY angry against the Jews, something which is scipturally justified in John 8:44. So, if you are a Christian, it's definitely worth a watch. If you aren't you might want to avoid subjecting yourself to the overall emotional bent that results from watching all this graphic violence, unless you are a horror fan.",The Passion of the Christ
272,movie-viking,No Anti Italian Bias Evident! Jewish Jesus seen!,9,14 October 2008,"Other comments above detail the depth of this stunning movie.Production quality seen here - Not a tightly woven super white ""bedsheet"" used for a robe evident anywhere. All garments appeared to have the slightly imperfect weave of a pre industrial society. Lighting, composition also great. Actor selection - No Blonds! No actors appeared to have come out of Stockholm, Amsterdam, or similar nordic towns. Good. Thus, actors had medium to somewhat dark coloring, appropriate for an area located near the sea in the Middleeast.Anti Italian Bias??? No, tho Romans (Italians) in this film are responsible for all violence against Jesus. They beat Jesus in that long ghastly scene and Roman Soldier nailed the nails in - Yet we KNOW that they represent all humans who have sinned. i.e. I and you are guilty also. I (vicariously) helped nail the nails in...etc.THE Jewish Jesus- Wish this film could have been seen in prewar Nazi Germany. Jesus (tho played by an Italian American) is still connected better with his Jewish culture than in other films I've seen (where he is too Nordic). Thus, Jesus followers in Germanywould have had a visual WAKEUP CALL - Persecuting Jews is persecuting Jesus' kin.",The Passion of the Christ

The film stuck very close to the Gospels and exuded brilliance from start to finish. I was so moved and drawn into this film like few others ever could. This is truly a must see film for anyone old enough to understand the subject matter. Owning the DVD is also a must. For Christians, this film goes to the heart of what Jesus went through in His action as a sacrificial lamb. Long ago, I read the medical aspects of what Jesus had suffered but no film of His life story ever came close to expressing what really happened on that fateful day.",The Passion of the Christ
274,ColeSear,A testament on behalf of us all,10,2 May 2004,"-possible spoilers-The Passion of the Christ is most definitely a film by Mel Gibson. With this film we see a man stake his claim as an elite director. Even prior to hearing about this project I had eagerly anticipated Gibson's 3rd Film.His first two films in my eyes were a resounding success. The Man without a Face is a harrowing tale about redemption and the living past in small town America. In it Gibson played a man who was accused of inproprieties with a former student. Eventually, he had an accident and had his face burned and was convicted of manslauhgter of the same student. Several years later he is seen as a freak and lives as a hermit in a small town. He gets a chance to teach again when a young man Charles Norstadt, played brilliantly by Nick Stahl in one of the top screen debuts of the past 15 years, needs his help to pass a test and escape his broken home.Gibson's directing style was non-existent in this film. It was invisible cutting and the classic Hollywood technique. Yet the results were extraordinary. What we get is a testament of friendship and a denouncement of persecution that is as moving as it is enthralling. Due to its subject matter The Man without a Face hardly made a dent at the box office and hardly garnered Gibson notoriety for his skills as a director.A few years later, however, came Braveheart. It was a critical and financial success. While some people find Gibson's use of slow motion to be heavyhanded, Braveheart and subsequently The Passion of the Christ show Gibson to be the shrewdest innovator in the use of slow motion effects in god knows how long because I generally hate them. There isn't a thing about this film that isn't great. Gibson has probably also received undue criticism because he was the second actor in a short period of time to win the Oscar for Best Director (Clint Eastwood, Unforgiven) yet both were very well deserved.The second film for a director is usually his make or break film if his first is a success. Gibson knew that Bravheart was a hard act to follow but he found a way to try and outdo himself. He went behind the camera and stayed there to make The PassionStepping back from the film for a second I want to wonder for a moment why people are so surprised Gibson set out to make this film. Mel Gibson operates his own production company called Icon Productions, the logo is apparently an Icon of the Virgin Mary. The seeds were sewn long ago. More importantly we must note that every great director has either made a film about Jesus or has contemplated it.Gibson's style is hardly unchanged. A detractor may say he took the Braveheart formula and applied it to the Passion but what we find here is Gibson's emrgence as an auteur. A man possessed, intent on making his film his way and may all those who don't like it please step out of his way. The first bold and brilliant move on his part was to shoot the film in Aramaic and Latin. While I was skeptical at his chances of having it released without subtitles, having seen them with subtitles I can honestly say they well could've been removed. We don't necessarily see this film, analyze this film or appreciate this film so much as we experiencce it. It couldn't have been any more difficult or real if he made it in 'real time.'My favorite part of the film is that Gibson cuts away from the Stations of the Cross and the Crucifixtion itself to: The Last Supper, The Kiss of Death, Jesus washing the Disciples' Feet, The Sermon on  the Mount, The Stoning of Mary Magdalene, to put into focus, to make real to us that through his death Jesus would absolve us of our sins and give us life everlasting; to show us that even amidst the brutality and the humiliation he suffered there was a reason to it. I seriously considered taking a break from the torture of seeing this film. I found myself questioning Mel Gibson at times in the film but I feel what really bothered me was that Jesus had to go through this. It was painful to watch but that doesn't make it any less real or artistic. There is a scene where he is being flogged by Roman soldiers that is so incessant that just hearing numbers shouted out in Latin sends shivers down your spine.As violent as the film was it makes the miracle of Easter which we witness for but a brief second at the end of the film all the more amazing and all the more of a blessing. Yet The Passion of the Christ takes on an added dimension because it is also a brilliant document of those who witnessed and suffered through Jesus' death, as we too suffer and witness it. One of the more brilliant moments in the film is when an unnamed woman risks her life to run past soldiers and gives Jesus a cloth so that he can sop up the blood on his face. It is obvious this is the Shroud of Turin but it is so subtley and beautifully done its a highlight in the film. Another amazing aspect of the film is the depiction of Mary. I like most Catholics I hold Mary dear to my heart, she is the ubermother for lack of a better word. Yet cinematic depictions of her always seemed to fall short of accuracy for some reason left unknown. Gibson points it out where Mary is snapped out of her suffering and is a mother. She runs to her son's aid. Jesus at this point gives Mary a huge kiss on the cheek. That coupled with a great flashback scene really show the fullest relationship between Mary and Jesus I think I've seen. We also Peter's denials of Christ done in a very original way along with Judas' suicide.Ultimately, it took me a while to draw these conclusions about the film because it is such an atypical film. Its not entertainment and its not a docummentary. It's  quite simply a man's love letter to Jesus Christ. A testament on behalf of us all that we are 'not worthy to receive him' yet so great is his love that he receives us all.",The Passion of the Christ
275,tamstrat,Beyond beautiful,10,5 July 2005,"This movie, more than any other movie I have witnessed in my 44 years on this planet, touched me more than anything I have ever seen. I can truly state that this movie brought me back to my Christian upbringing after years of doubt and apathy.What can I say that hasn't already been said? Yes, it's graphic, but lets be honest, being crucified was graphic, it was one of the most horrible ways to die in Roman Times and only the worst thieves and criminals suffered this terrible death. That's what makes Jesus Christ's death on the cross so horrible, here was a Man who died a shameful death,and it could not have been shown any other way. I applaud Mel Gibson in refusing to whitewash what happened to Christ in his last hours on this earth.It showed Jesus as not only the Son of God, but as a man, terrified and conflicted about what he knew his destiny was to be. There are scenes that are almost unbearable to watch, the flogging scene in particular left the audience I was with in the theater literally gasping and recoiling in horror, I have never been in a movie where so many people, male and female were in tears at what they were seeing on the screen. Again, Gibson took heat for this scene and at times even I thought ""enough already"", but after watching it and reflecting on it, I understand what Gibson was trying to convey, that Christ suffered, REALLY SUFFERED at Calvary for my sins.The scenes showing Jesus and Mary were so hard to watch too, as a mother of a son myself, I can scarcely imagine what Mary went through watching her son repeatedly beaten, spat upon and ultimately crucified, yet knowing this was the reason he was sent to earth. The scene of Jesus falling while carrying the cross to Calvary and Mary running to him, and the flashback of him as a child falling and her comforting him had me in tears (the only time in a movie where I was actually sobbing), and I wasn't the only one.I feel the film was unjustly portrayed as anti-Semitic. Most of the Jews in the film were portrayed in a positive light, the Jews DID NOT CRUCIFY Jesus!!!! It was the Romans who hung him on the cross. Yes, history tells us some of the Jewish leaders had a hand in it as well, but the Bible also tells us that following Jesus to Calvary were many Jews to quote the Bible ""Weeping and Wailing"". I feel anyone who really watches the film should be able to pick up on this, if they really watch it and keep an open mind.This movie lead me back to church and back to Christ. I am not preaching, it is just the reality for me, and I am personally glad Mel Gibson had the courage to make a movie that portrayed what the ""passion"" of Christ is all about. Even if you don't believe Jesus is the Son of God as I do, please watch this with an open mind to at least see what a good and decent man endured in the name of his Faith.",The Passion of the Christ

This is the most bloody biblical movie I've ever seen, a bit too much if you ask me.It is very clear that Mel Gibson wants to show the most horrific side of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. I found the scene where Jesus gets whipped very graphic and much too long, it was like Gibson wanted everybody truly to understand the pain Jesus was going through but the only thought I had was 'Enough already'. I thought it was a bit over the edge. If you're a bit sensitive about graphical & scary movies you shouldn't watch this one.",The Passion of the Christ

278,jkbonner1,The final hours in the life of Eyeshua Bar-Yosef,9,12 May 2014,"Depicted in this movie are the last twelve hours of the life of Eyeshua Bar-Yosef, better known as Jesus the Christ (or anointed one) according to the gospels of the New Testament. Because Greek does not have an sh sound, Eyeshua became Iēsous although the Greek NT often used nomina sacra―abbreviations consisting of two or three letter―to indicate his name. Iēsous became Iesus in Latin.There are two claims often made in regard to this man, and they need to be clearly distinguished: (1) Jesus as a messiah (either of the Jewish people or of the entire human race); (2) Jesus as the son of god. These existential claims do not signify the same thing even though they are often confounded. Although the gospel of John clearly stresses the second claim, it isn't at all clear what exactly was the position of the earthly Jesus since virtually nothing is known about his life outside of the gospels. The other three gospels suggest the first claim only.Within the context of their history as a separate people, the Jews were (and orthodox Jews still are) awaiting a messiah to arise to free them from their bondage, much as Moses had arisen in the past to release them from their bondage in Egypt. Because of this role, the messiah was expected to bring political power to bear on the situation of the Jews. Within the long, tortuous course of Jewish history, many men have stepped forward claiming to be the messiah. Most suffered very uncomfortable deaths. The powers that be do not kindly brook rebels.The temple guards were ordered to arrest Jesus and bring him before the temple priests was so that they could question him and decide on his messiah claims. For a Jew as Jesus was to have declared that he was the son of god would have been blasphemy in the eyes of the Jews. The priests would have petitioned the Romans to allow them to put to death a blasphemer, and to keep order the Romans would no doubt have assented. By Jewish law a blasphemer would have died by being stoned to death at the hands of other Jews.That Jesus did not die by stoning suggests that his role was interpreted by the temple priests as a man claiming to be the messiah. This would have put the priests in a very delicate and precarious position. Upon questioning, it was clear that Jesus possessed no power to free the Jews politically. Therefore, for the priests to have supported Jesus' claim would have put the Jews in jeopardy since Judea at the time was under Roman jurisdiction and governed by a Roman procurator, Pontius Pilate. Regardless of what kind of life Jesus had led, it simply would not have been politically expedient to allow him to continue living. Thus, he was crucified by Roman soldiers under Roman law, as was anyone found guilty of a capital offense and who were not Roman citizens.Of course, this isn't the end of the story. Jesus' life subsequently became interpreted as a mission enshrined in the myth of his miraculous birth and especially of his death as required by god to redeem humanity for our sins. Jesus' resurrection was interpreted as the ultimate triumph of humanity over death. When I use the word ""myth,"" I should explain that I am not using the term in a pejorative sense as being untrue. In fact, strictly speaking the terms truth/untruth in a rational/scientific sense are simply not appropriate to a myth. Whether a person accepts the myth that the world was created by a Judeo-Christian god and that Jesus is his son made incarnate and who died on the cross for humanity to propitiate our sins* or does not accept it should be a matter of personal choice.During the brutal scenes, I found myself thinking about the terrible suffering of this man, Jesus (Eyeshua). Regardless of whether one believes in the divinity of Jesus or does not, the movie was thought provoking and impressively done. The acting was good and emotionally evocative, and the use of the authentic languages of the time―Latin by the Romans and Aramaic by the Jews―establishes the movie at a high level of artistic and intellectual achievement. At the very least a historical movie should have a few lines of the original languages used by the participants to add realism.Jesus clearly died an agonizing death. But perhaps a more interesting question is: What exactly was he intending? And why, given the political and social context of his time, did he think that he could get away with saying the things that he did? The movie did not provide an answer, in fact, could not provide an answer, and most probably such a question will never be resolved.9/10* Agnus dei qui tollis peccata mundi miserere nobis.

It doesn't deserve the controversy and accusations surrounding it, but it also doesn't deserve to be making huge $$ at the box office. The fact that it's going to end up with such a huge total is less indicative of its quality than it is a matter of getting a lot of people who normally wouldn't go to the movies out and into the theater. I thought the movie was alright, and Caviezel and others did a good job, I just don't think it's anything great. The best scenes were actually those with Mary, and I also liked the way Satan was done...except for that final shot. As for the much-talked-about violence, it wasn't all that bad.

281,HBeachBabe,no context,5,15 April 2004,"Is it even possible to review a film like this without dealing with matters of faith?  That is, can you review the *film* without reviewing the *event*?I doubt it, but I'm gonna try anyway.The Passion of the Christ is less a film than it is an acknowledgment of the event.  It lacks many of things a film generally requires to be considered a good film- plot, characterization, dialog - and yet, to many people, it's a masterpiece and saying anything bad about the *film* becomes akin to saying something bad about Christianity.As a film, The Passion fails.  There is no plot to speak of.  It is simply a showing of events, or more precisely, one event - the torture and execution of Jeshua (Jesus).  The filmmakers assume we know the life of Jeshua and count on this foreknowledge to give context to the events shown.  But whether you know his story or not, a film needs context.  It requires that the events have some connection to one another and some reason for happening.  Here, all we see is a man being tortured, mostly because of the hatred of some Jewish priest, but the exact reason is lost to us.  The limited flashbacks don't show us nearly enough to justify this priest's hatred.What we are left with is a sequence of events that just happen, like a Sunday School Passion Play.  There is no new take on the material.  It isn't shown in any way different from any film before it other than being more violent.There is no characterization here either.  In keeping with the idea that this is just a sequence of events, the people are generally unimportant and in fact are often hard to tell apart.  There are certainly no character arcs to speak of.  No one changes, no one grows.  That would require a plot, an adversary, a conflict, none of which are in this film.  Events just happen.The film requires more than passing knowledge of the Gospels to give it any context.  This is not a film for people who don't know the story as it will seem totally pointless.  This is not a film for non-believers who will simply see it as exaggerated propaganda.  Is it a film for believers?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure what it accomplishes for Christians.  does it edify? does it give glory to God?  I didn't see that but perhaps I'm just too much a film critic to see this as anything but a failed film when Mel Gibson's intention wasn't to make a ""film"" in the traditional sense but instead to show believers exactly what they believe.I will give the film credit (although only about 4 seconds worth) for including a reference to the resurrection.  Most films about Jesus end at his death but in Christian theology, hid death is far less important than his resurrection.  Plenty of so-called prophets were put to death.  the reason Jesus' death is of any significance is because of the resurrection. without it, his was just another crucifixion.  And yet, while Gibson includes it, it is so brief and not connected to anything previously seen (in particular, the oft-repeated line about tearing down the temple and rebuilding it in 3 days) that it's almost as bad as not including it at all.Obviously, this film has spoken to people in some manner, but from a non-Christian perspective, evaluating The Passion as a *film*, it fails. From a Christian perspective, it offers nothing new to the story of Jeshua that a Sunday sermon doesn't already provide, and by focusing on the brutality absent the reason (both actual and spiritual) it may even offer less.",The Passion of the Christ
282,poetellect,hypocritical barbarism masquarading as art,5,27 February 2004,"First off, let me say that I feel that Christianity, indeed Christ's lifeand teachings, are some of the most spiritual, loving,philosophical, metaphysical, and far-reaching truths ever spokenby an avatar to remind people of our eternal validity.However, this schlock by Gibson disappoints and offends me.  Notbecause of any anti-semitism- a person could read into any filmdepicting Christ's death and choose to see anti-semetism if theywanted to.  What offends me is how this entire film was marketedand sold.  Talk about worshipping idols.  Unlike tasteful, evencontroversial films about Christ in the past, such as Scorsese'sbeautiful ""Last Temptation of Christ"", this film insists onmerchandizing, capitolizing, and hitting you over the head withChrist's ""message of love"", all compact in a wrapper of suchviolence and brutality on screen I have never  before seen, nor everwant to see again.  The T-Shirts that Gibson started selling abouta month before this opened were enough to make me want topuke.  All in all, it's films like these that remind of Christianity's veryreal dark side, evidenced by the scores of indigenous people whowere exterminated in the New World in the name of Christ, thepapal inquisitions, and the Catholic dogma today that still refusesto condone the use of condoms in Africa and the validity andhumanity of the gay population.Don't waste your time seeing this.  If you're looking for a film thattakes you back to Christianity's original message, rent TerryGilliam's ""The Fisher King""- this film is a much bettercondensation of Christ's message, and much more enjoyable andfunny to boot.  It doesn't hurt, literally, to watch, as ""The Passion ofChrist"" does.  EXCRUTIATINGLY so.",The Passion of the Christ
283,ringfire211,"""It was as it was...""",10,12 March 2004,"Film Review: `The Passion of the Christ' Rating: **** out of ****`It was as it was!'  These were the words uttered by the Pope John Paul II prior to the film's theatrical release.  Now, having seen the film, I have to agree.  Mel Gibson has brought us another masterpiece - the first being the highly acclaimed `Braveheart' for which Mel won an Academy Award back in 1995.  Kudos to Mel!  `The Passion' captures the essence of the Christian belief by revealing the exact path by which we were saved from eternal damnation.  Needless to say, this path was not an easy one.The film is very gripping and gritty, to be sure, and reveals the raw violence as it occurred without smoothing anything over in order to keep lovely smiles on the audience's faces.  In the age of excessive violence in film, here comes a film with perhaps the most gory and graphic violence that may have ever been shown.  However, this film uses this violence to grab the viewer and say, `Wake up, buddy! This is the way it really happened! No, it was not a pretty sight! Yes, you must accept it because 'it was as it was'!'  You have not truly seen Christ's 'passion' until you have seen this film.  The film is best viewed when the viewer doesn't hold anything back and just lets the emotions flow.  This is about our salvation, and at the end of the film you can truly feel the victory of good over evil.  If you walk away with dry eyes, you did not experience Christ's passion. Jim Caviezel was excellent in his portrayal of Jesus Christ.  Jim was as good as Jeffrey Hunter in 1961's `King of Kings' and Robert Powell in 1977's `Jesus of Nazareth.'  It doesn't compare to the lame efforts of some of the recent TV productions that I've seen.  My suggestion is `Go and see Christ's passion and in the process you will discover your own passion that may have been buried inside you for a long time.  It may be time to let that passion out and experience the closeness of the Lord as never before.Amen.'P.S.  Ebert & Roeper gave `The Passion' two thumbs up!!!

It's a shame.This is a fantastic piece of cinema which is important. Important in the sense it was released. If Weinstein didn't have this released then I think we'd be taking 2 steps back in life.The direction is brilliant, it is cleat Gibson took time and care in making this film.

285,NewDivide1701,Feel the Passion,9,2 March 2006,"A movie about the last 12 hours of Christ's life brings forth an incredible portrayal of courage that no one has ever seen before. And this review is coming from a non-religious person.One man, declared a heretic by the church of the time, tortured and killed to save the souls of the people he loves. You can feel the determination, the love, the agony, and the pain.From the people he is trying to save, some you do feel the hatred from them, but for most, you feel the sorrow when they see Christ tortured, the pity, and the shame for allowing it to happen. This also says that the Passion of the Christ is about as anti-semitic as belly button lint. This movie shows no sign that it is an attack on the Jewish community. Rather it shows love, not just for the Jewish and Hebrew faiths, but everyone.Being a fan of Star Trek, you learn to see the meaning behind everything, and saying that this movie is anti-semitic is no different than calling Christ a heretic.Well acted, beautifully portrayed, incredibly directed, one of the best movies of that time. Mel Gibson had definitely outdone himself in his passion.Give Passion of the Christ 9 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
286,Doogie D,Pretty good film; likely to be murky for the uninitiated,5,26 February 2004,"Judged as a film alone, The Passion of the Christ is wanting: there's not a lot of context for why this man is submitting to martyrdom.  Yes, a shrouded figure whispers that ""one man can't take on the sins of the world alone,"" but that's about all the viewer gets to hang onto for the two-hour ride.Judged as a spiritual piece -- well, it strikes me as much more religious than spiritual.  It's probably going to be remembered as a pretty effective footnote for illustrating, to some extent, the pain that Jesus or many other political prisoners have gone through; but there's not much of a sense that this man is really anything More.  So when Pilate utters the crucial line, ""Behold The Man,"" it sounds like Jesus is being given Honorable Mention in Scourging, since he survives an awful lot without much of a squawk. 
In Scripture, Pilate's utterance is much, much more resonant.  We have the sense that this Jesus, by the governor's estimate, is the very epitome of perfection of Man, and that includes the spiritual aspect which is part of our fabric.  Pilate sensed that this Jesus truly did have it all, so to speak, and he was amazed.Scripture brings me to another problem I have with the film.  Why, when time and again someone sets about to ""get it right,"" do they continue to add to the text?  This film is littered with scenes which do not appear in the Gospels, if, indeed, in Scripture at all; it seems to me that artistic gifts of faith like this movie actually show a marked LACK of faith for not trusting that God has told the story the way He intended it to be set down. Christians, time and again, try to ""help"" God by fudging details of what happened, what was said, or ""the hard sayings."" -- What they really need is to heed the great editor mark, ""stet.""For God's sake -- if this is for God's sake -- can we quit adding the jots and tittles to the whole of our faith?I'd give this a C+.",The Passion of the Christ
287,MyOpinionIsFact,Not good let alone great,5,2 April 2004,"This movie is well-crafted. But unless you are a Christian, it isn't very moving. The violence is displayed in an almost pornographic fashion. We're supposed to feel bad, I guess, because Jesus was tortured and by showing that torture in detail it is supposed to make us feel even worse. Well, it doesn't work for me. He was a guy that started a new cult, which was against the law, and he was punished for it according to the laws of the land, severe as they may have been. Jesus certainly isn't the only person in history to have been tortured. But of course, if you believe he was the Christ, everything changes. A better movie could have been made that tries to so how cruel people have been to others (usually because of religion), and the message could have been to embrace our differences rather than fear them. I did learn from this movie that the devil shaves his eyebrows because it looks weird. I also don't understand how people can have guilt for something that happened before they were born. Nobody alive today ""put Jesus up there"" although I agree some people alive today *would* do it. But you can't have guilt for something you didn't do. Anyway 5/10 because it was different and fairly well-made. It just doesn't work for me.",The Passion of the Christ

Mel Gibson's interpretations of the Gospels and his gory exploitation of it didn't sit well with me at all. First, unless you're one of those Christians who believe every word of the good book came from the hand of God, you must then open yourself up to some interpretation. The four Gospels were written two generations after the crucifixion. They don't all square with each other. The film has to be put in an historical context. There were many fighting for the heart and soul and land of Judea. Jesus was a pacifist, Barrabas was a militant. The elders of the Temple weren't pleased to have someone around who was preaching what they deemed heresy. Keep in mind, the Church used to burn heretics at the stake, so the early Church was no bastion of virtue. It was a bloody time. I saw a lot of anti-semitism in the film and those who missed it did so because they didn't want to see it. Now we have churches whose markees read ""The Jews Killed Our Lord"" (see LA Times). Even the Catholic Church no longer teaches that canard, if this film starts a wave of anti-semetic behavior here or in Europe, then Mr. Gibson could find himself with blood on his hands.

You begin to realize that the intent of the entire movie is no more than what you would be exposed to in any blood and horror movie and not a factual piece or biography of one of the most talked about events in history.

Of course Christians seem at times, rabidly, to hate sex in almost all forms although they do not carry this feeling to violence - witness the last two thousand years. Mel 'mad max' Gibson seems to have hit upon a novel scam: create a movie about Christ thus ensuring much publicity, then do it the american way - heap unspeakable amounts of violence, cruelty and sadism, graphically illustrated by the best film technology existent, and do not let up for the entire movie. Somehow infer that although the Romans (Italians), judged Christ, nailed Christ to a cross, and punctured him with a spear - it was actually the Jews who areresponsible for the death of Jesus. I don't know whether Mel was being serious about this, or whether he is just obtuse. I think it is a really novel way of making money - not only is mel doing the talk show circuit, he is also doing the EWTN, 700 Club circus. That's it Mel, leave no stone unturned. This movie has nothing to do with the Jesus in the gospels - this movie is a religious glorification of brutality and gore and as such it is sickening.

The violence is actually not as bad as some people try to make it out as. I actually thought that the movie was somewhat restrained, but that is if I compare it to splatter-flicks such as ""Beyond the limits"", ""Hellraiser 2"" or ""Braindead"". Unlike those movies this should aims a much higher target, the life and death of a very influential person (whether he existed or not), and it just does't pull that off. It's just violence for the sake of it. Mel Gibson obviously thinks that too many people are just too stupid to get anything unless it's shoved down their throats and therefor tries to beat the viewers into submission by making ""The Passion of the Christ"" far gorier than it really had to be. He basically tells the viewer: ""Look at this man, if he suffered this for you much you must obey him."". An extremely shallow message that obviously seems to work.And he doesn't stop there, all feelings of the characters are just crammed down your esophagus until you just want to puke the whole stinking mess straight into Gibson's face.The whole movie is also so extremely one-dimensional and dumb that it actually makes me hate him for it. For example the Jews in this movie are depicted as people of pure hatred and spite, constantly mocking and beating Jesus.And no, it does not even stop at that. Even homosexuality gets a punch by characterizing Satan as a very feminine man who wears a lot of makeup.The ancient languages spoken by the people in the movie only serves to make this movie look more intelligent than it actually is. When a movie is this thin it actually borders on narcissism and only serves make it feel even more pretentious than it already does.Also another thing that strikes me when I watch this is how little we actually get to know about Jesus as person, Gibson preaches for those who already believe in the Bible and is completely unable to move anyone who is merely interested in Christianity or make anyone interested who doesn't give a flying one about Christianity. Jesus could actually be any person who has committed a crime an then suffered the consequences, and actually this gives me support for my theory: Jesus was just a madman who got nailed to the cross because he could not keep his mouth shut. Hmmm. Wait. Wasn't this movie supposed to promote and support Christianity? Well that is just one example of the way you can interpret this movie. This basically means that Gibson actually had no idea of what the hell he was doing. He was probably to busy making fake blood to understand what this movie was supposed to be about.I have actually no idea how people can like this movie. It lacks every hint of thought and depth.

Why did Jesus' eyes keep changing color? Why did Satan keep appearing? Why did that random woman give Mary those towels? Was all this supposed to be symbolic in some way? It really didn't work.The main part of the movie was really repetitive and I found unintentionally funny. When Jesus was carrying the crucifix, every few seconds he would fall down, and it would be shown in like 20 different camera angles and unnecessary slow motion. If it was trying to be dramatic, it missed the mark and ended up being satirical.There were some parts that worked for me.

Films directed by Mel Gibson are normally very emotionally strong and his Jesus film is no exception. It is clearly that this film means A LOT to director Mel Gibson.From start to finish it is an emotionally roller-coaster ride with a great written dialogue, strong gory scenes of Jesus getting tortured, a seducing score and plenty of love! The film is like a big love story. Jesus shows under his torture that he forgives man for its ignorance and for not knowing better. Though he gets whipped, almost torn apart and crucified, he does not once give the impression that he hates man or that he feels sorry for himself. It is all about forgiveness  great! One of the most important things in this film is the score. It is SO beautiful and could not be more perfect, and when it is mixed with the love filled dialogue, you get an emotionally which I don't believe can be found anywhere else.All the way through this film I had tears in my eyes and whenever you are a Christian or not, THE PASSION OF THE Christ is a film not to be missed.But take this warning: Though it truly IS an emotionally strong and beautiful love story, then the torture scenes ARE disturbing and upsetting, which makes the film unsuitable for the squeamish.",The Passion of the Christ

Ignore it.From the opening scenes in the garden you are pulled into the story. The mists swirling around the characters lend a surreal atmosphere, but the reality of the situation is hammered home with the light of dawn. The flashbacks to the last supper, the sermon on the mount, the woman at the well... these are woven into the tapestry of this film so cleanly, they belong.Whether a nail goes into palms or wrists is a meaningless criticism. Anyone who could see this as a call for anti-Semitism knows nothing about Christianity.There is no judgement here, it is simply the telling of the story with every possible detail as described by eye witnesses. It does not attempt to convince you to become a Christian, or to hate the Jews, it does nothing except tell the story... and yet, that is everything.During the movie, I heard no audience sounds except the occasional cough. After the movie, a visibly stunned audience moved quietly and reverently out of the theater into the lobby where a few gathered in groups (I'm assuming some church groups were there). Just before leaving the theater, I looked up and saw maybe 15 or 20 people sitting with their heads down, some sobbing or trying to gather their senses.I feel as though I have witnessed something incredible, something totally different.

Mel Gibson uses artistic freedom in many scenes - some reminiscent of Fellini and even Hitchcock (the scene where the crow pecks out the eyes). I thought the use of old languages was very effective. If I have one criticism - it is the music - which seemed very over the top - even more over the top than the torture of Jesus. A modern classic by a modern master. I hope Mel Gibson continues to direct as well as act. The use of flash backs offered much needed relief to the unrelenting Stations of the Cross and I loved the ending to the film - which was very minimalist in contrast to the Grand Opera of the Crucifixion.

The production value, and the decision to have the dialogue in Amaraic are very impressive (even though the Romans are shown speaking Latin, which though they did speak in Italy, everywhere else they spoke Greek). It's very impressive. Unfortunately the experience lacks depth.The Passion without context is just torture porn. Every biblical film focuses the majority of the time on Jesus's life, with the crucifixion taking no more than 10 minutes. This film tries to give context with brief 30-second flashbacks of Jesus giving the Seemon on the Mount, but in a vacuum this isn't enough time for us to care about why this guy is being tortured and executed.The film tries to make up for this and make you sympathize with Jesus with extremely brutal abuse, but they go so far no man could ever survive it. Jesus may have been the Son of God, but he was given a physical human body with Earthly limitations. As he's being arrested, he's knocked off a bridge and caught in the chain restraints. That would've killed him already. The whipping scene drags on over 10 minutes, and I lost count of how many times he was hit after 130. The scene is so bloody, he would've died of blood loss before they could do anything else.His suffering is prolonged as much as possible. Every time he falls its in 30 seconds of slow motion, grinding the already slow pacing to a hault. After dogpaddling it's way to the 126-minute mark, we can't even be rewarded with an epilogue of the impact he had on his apostles and other followers.This is the fundamental problem, not just with the movie, but the extreme sects of Christianity who use the Passion as a scare/guilt tactic and make that the focus of the Gospel rather than Jesus's teachings and the events of his life leading up to it.

This was wrong because after a couple of minutes, I did not even notice there were subtitles.  I just read them automatically and heard the languages being spoken but thanks to the subtitles, understood what was said.  Further, a great deal of the movie is visual.3 - I thought it would be too gory.  All I heard about was how bloody or how gory the movie was.  It was far less than in most horror movies (and I don't like those anyway).  My children saw it with me (boy age 12 and girl age 13) and neither of them thought it was too gory.  Nor did my wife.  Yes, there was some blood but it was definitely not over the top or played for the gross reaction like other movies would play it.4 - I thought it would be too ""preachy"".  It wasn't.  It did not try to save your soul or anything like that.  It was more of ""here is the biblical account, figure it out for yourself"".  5 - I thought the flashbacks would be confusing.  They were not.  They added the right amount of flavor to a story that, had it just been a straight line story of the last 12 hours, would have become too overwhelming.  They did not cover everything about Christ and they did not cover several things in as much depth as some might have wanted (the ""cast the first stone"" scene especially since unless you know the story, you won't understand what is going on) but it flowed and felt right. So, in short, quit reading reviews and worrying about this or that and just see it and form your own opinion.  Everyone will see this one differently I believe but I think I can safely say my preconceptions about the movie were wrong and I did enjoy it.",The Passion of the Christ
304,Drewboy-2,Greater love hath no man...,10,29 February 2004,"I just finished watching this long-awaited film this morning and like many others, I was stunned silent by the graphic, yet totally realistic, portrayal of the Passion and crucifixion.  No other film about Jesus Christ comes close in showing what He did for all of us.  Greater love hath no man than to lay down his life for his friends.  Italy was made to effectively resemble Jerusalem in AD 29, the year scholars have placed the death and resurrection of Jesus.  The decision to film in Aramaic and Latin added a reality that an English version would have detracted from, and the subtitles in no way distracted from the screen action.  Mel Gibson did a totally fantastic job in his direction, and Jim Caviezel was spellbinding in his portrayal of Christ.  Ever since seeing this actor for the first time in FREQUENCY, he has brought a sense of morality and decency into all his acting, even when he ultimately played the bad guy in HIGH CRIMES.  Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci brought wonderful reality to their roles, respectively, as Mary the Mother of Christ and Mary Magdalene.  I loved the flashbacks, especially since this film showed the Lord as a dutiful yet sometimes feisty son (watch for a funny scene between Jesus and His mother that was probably the only laugh in the whole film - wonderfully done).  Also, the actress who played Claudia, the wife of Pontius Pilate, was exquisite.  A scene between her and Mary the Mother of Christ was wonderfully done and showed her to be a totally unselfish and loving person.  I also could even feel for Pilate as he agonized over what to do in the situation.  He did not want to put Jesus to death, but had no choice.  I often wonder what would have happened otherwise.  The actor playing Simon of Cyrene, who carried Christ's Cross to Golgotha, did an excellent job as well portraying a man riddled with doubt yet ultimately believing in the Messiah.  Simon's character is the one referenced in the Christian song ""Watch the Lamb"".Please go see this movie with an open mind and watch how this man suffered to redeeem all of us.  Be prepared to cry, and guys - don't be ashamed of it if you do.  And to the charges of anti-Semitism, I say it is ridiculous. Not one reference in this film that Jews were totally responsible for the death of Jesus - it was all of us, Gentile and Jew alike, from those times even to the present.This film will change your life if you let it.  See it soon.",The Passion of the Christ
305,antoinebachmann,masochistic and sickening has NOTHING to do with Christian message,2,22 October 2010,"Frankly I do not understand how Mel Gibson could have thought this has anything to do with the Christian message, ie basically be good to others.The whole film is about the torture inflicted to Christ, depicted in long graphic detail which is sickening and can only appeal, as far as I'm concerned, to people inhabited by strong masochistic or sadistic tendencies.As for the good things Jesus said, the positive messages, there is pretty much none of that.It's as if Mel Gibson wanted to do a sado-masochistic film, and he thought this would be a good excuse. It is said that he had mass celebrated every morning and all - I frankly don't see why.This is a truly pathetic movie - not technically, but in its message.Technically of course, it is well-made, and it was a tour de force to use only the languages of way back then.But overall it's probably one of the very least useful or enjoyable movies of all times.",The Passion of the Christ
306,spinbunny,Confirmation of MY PERSONAL beliefs,1,22 February 2004,"I saw this movie as a guest at a press screening. ""Interesting"" is one way to word it.  Director Mel Gibson is an egotist beyond belief and brings his views to the screen --- they are his views and this is a vanity project and the fact that is being released on 2800 screens is amazing. Is it anti-Semetic? that depends upon your interpretation: Mel's father should be shot for his comments on the holocaust and Mel is a product of his environment as we all are.I DID NOT like this movie: the actors are AMAZING: Jim Caveziel especially. The visuals are amazing, the cinematography sublime: but it is still not a GOOD MOVIE. It does not deserve to make any money as it is PURE VANITY.It is propaganda on the scale of 1930's Germany and will be the subject of news stories and university and college classes for DECADES to come. Will it be a subject for ministers, rabbis, atheists, agnostics and all others in the field to argue about forever and a day? YES...it is even on CNN now. (and I am LOVING IT!)Will it win awards? Sadly I imagine it will. Does it deserve it? No. (but that is free speech, folks!)Does it even deserve a vote? No. (as there are no minuses on a scale of one to ten).See it and decide for yourself ... just don't be surprised if you think you wasted your money and gave Mel some more filthy lucre to satisfy his enormous ego with.",The Passion of the Christ
307,djansen24,Let this film bless who it will and offend who it will...,10,8 September 2011,"Only one other time have I been left speechless by a film, and that was Schindler's List. But even that experience paled in comparison to how emotionally drained and grateful I was for watching Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ. I simply cannot believe it was made on a budget of only $30,000,000. So much research and craftsmanship was put into this film, it makes other big-budgeted films look silly in comparison.I am a devout Christian, and I found this film to be a holy and cathartic experience for me. The Scripture quote at the beginning is perfect. I felt more grateful to Jesus than ever after seeing what He suffered for me. I also really understood what it must have been like for him to have ""borne the weight of our iniquities"". It became very tangible to me. I suspect that any devotee of another religion (particularly Judaism) will be offended by this film. They don't know the Man as yet, though I pray they will want to know Him after seeing this glorious picture. The best aspect of this film is that it for the most part stays true to the Bible's accounts of Jesus's final hours. I do not approve of any portrayal of Jesus where He is saying things not specifically in the Bible . You run the risk of putting words in His mouth that He did not intend. But Gibson and Jim Cavezal (as Jesus) have Jesus almost entirely only quoting Scripture. It is simply the best portrayal of the Messiah I have ever seen. How he did not get the Oscar for best actor is beyond me. Having the costuming, language, sets all so realistic immerses the audience in the moment. And Jesus is shown exactly as I would have imagined Him, as a man who can see right into the hearts of anyone, able to pierce their soul with but a simple look. He is portrayed as He should be, 100% human and 100% God and unlike anyone you have ever seen. Which makes His death so much more devastating. Special point of interest: I love how they have Pilate start to talk to Jesus in Hebrew, Jesus responds in Latin, which then stuns Pilate and his cohorts. All of the cast from lead to extra have their moments. Gibson must have taken great pains to make sure each and every cast member understood exactly their part to play and how they felt about experiencing this moment in Jesus' life. I applaud the decision to show the resurrection only very briefly at the end. It leaves you with questions and wanting to know more, rather than wrapping everything up nice and tidy. It is an incredibly violent film. One of the most bloody and gruesome I have ever seen. Do NOT let kids of any age see this! It will overwhelm them. Whether or not you are a Christian, you may also be put off by the violence. But to me, the violence was necessary because it helped me to understand and appreciate just what carrying the sins of the world meant. I don't know how it could have been portrayed otherwise. I have seen many Christian films showing the crucifixion, but they were shoddy and never really moved me. In general Christian films are shoddy in their production values and even more astounding, their story-telling. They make the Bible account seem superficial. But Gibson somehow accomplishes the impossible with making a Biblical account play out like a secular film. It is not advertised as a ""Christian"" film, nor should it be. It plays out like a drama. But for those who know Jesus intimately, they know it all actually happened.While a film of this magnitude does not need to be defended, I will defend one critique against it; for the sole purpose of encouraging more people to see it. A lot of controversy came out of this film concerning its so-called anti-semitism. Let me make this perfectly clear, this film is NOT anti-semitic. It takes the Bible's depiction of the crucifixion (mixed in with a little Catholic non-Biblical tradition) and tells it like it is. Since the Gospels were written as eye-witness accounts, in order to not be offended, one must have an acceptance of these accounts as history. But the film's motivation just as the Bible's is to witness to an event that actually took place. The film shows the sin of those who would condemn Jesus, but confines it to individuals, not races of people. The religious leaders of Jesus' time sought to protect their power structure and diplomatic relations with Rome. But the ordinary Jews on the streets for the most part react as anyone would to seeing Jesus' trial and execution: absolute horror. And that is one detail I liked in the film. Varities of reactions from the mobs were shown. The acting of the extras is so strong, you can see how each individual felt about Jesus by how they react to his suffering. So, it is not anti-semitic even if Mel Gibson personally may be.I want all people to experience Christ and understand what this film set out to do, retell his final hours and resurrection. If you are someone who has seen this film and been offended, I hope that those barriers will come down. God bless you richly!",The Passion of the Christ

Okay it is a very well-made movie and is also well-acted and that's why I gave it 5/10 rather than zero, but I mean, it's just a blood orgy. I can believe that Christ went through all that but there needs to be a bit more about the story rather than him just getting tortured and humiliated. If you're wondering what its about, its about the last thirteen days of Jesus. I'd also like to ask why some don't find this movie anti-semitic. For those of you who've seen this movie and don't find it offensive to Jewish people, let me ask you: how can you not find this movie anti-semitic when Mel Gibson portrays Jewish kids as demons, he missuses one of the most important questions in the Jewish Passover ceremony having Mary use this question in a completely distorted context or uses offensive stereotypes toward the Jews (all Jews having big noses and being money lovers etc.)? And also, is there some reason why Pilate is portrayed as a saintly figure in this film? And by the way Crucifiction was a Roman method of execution, not a Jewish one. They crucified troublemakers/revolutionaries and Jesus was one.To conclude my review, this movie was visually brilliant but it was very manipulative.",The Passion of the Christ

I went to see The Passion of the Christ because I thought I would somehow be uplifted by a man's Spiritual Vision. But what I saw instead was something I could not watch to the end. I choose what films I see carefully. I do not like to see Bad Art. I went to see this film assuming I would be uplifted. Quite the opposite happened for me. As I waited to feel elevated by the story of the crucifixion, I was telling myself, `This is only a movie. This carnage is not real.' I continued to wait for the uplift. When the nails were seen to pierce the hands of the actors (I'm told that Gibson used his own hands for this scene) I realized I had seen enough a long time before and I walked out of the theater.

310,yddsp@aol.com,A staggering perspective...not for the faint of heart,10,6 November 2008,"Through the years Hollywood has approached the subject of The Christ, in many ways and with varying perspectives, yet has always remained within the bounds of moderation. This film crosses those bounds with a realism that staggers the imagination. When one considers the act of scourging as a form of punishment, the reality of the act itself seems to elude us. This is not the case with this depiction, as the graphic details make the viewer cringe in horror as the flesh is being rent, right down to the bone.After seeing this movie for the first time, I wasn't quite so anxious to see it again, and it has now been nearly four years. It wasn't for a lack of interest, or because it wasn't a great film, it was due to the emotional impact it had left on me. Just the sight of someone being tortured to the point of near-death, then considering that this ""someone"" was, for Christians, their Lord and Savior, was a bit disconcerting to say the least. From the acting, to the directing and production, this film is an example of cinematic excellence. It really blew my mind, and shook me to the depths of my soul. WOW!",The Passion of the Christ
311,morkulv_athferion,Unexcusable waste of time,1,10 July 2010,"I think the people that will get the most kicks out of this film are (obviously) Christian people who spent most of their time actively propagating their religion to other people. This might sound harsh, but its really how this film comes across to me. I can tell you now that 75% of the entire goddamn movie is just Jesus getting tortured and beaten, to further emphasize the suffering he supposedly went through.I don't mind violence in movies, and if you read my other reviews you would know that I love horror-movies that feature large amounts of gore and blood. This however, is not serving any purpose. Its violence for the sake of being violent, and that makes The Passion of the Christ one of the most utterly pointless films I have ever sat through.The story is about the final hours of Jesus, and unless your a Christian I honestly think that you won't care one bit about it. This movie has so little to say, that it quickly resorts to the beatings and whippings to shove this message of ""Jesus suffered for you!"" down your throat. By the end you are ask yourself: ""is this it? Is this the epic masterpiece of Mel Gibson?"".In conclusion: I would rather sit through a 24-hour marathon of Jesus Christ Superstar then watch this movie one more time.",The Passion of the Christ
312,Tyler_R_Weston,"Does His Passion Mean Nothing to Us? He Had Died with Scarred, Torn Flesh with Nothing but Love Left Inside His Heart...",10,8 March 2004,"The Passion of the Christ is truly a powerful story. Based on the true facts of history, Jesus of Nazareth had himself sacrificed to have our sins forgiven. He had suffered a scourge...He had suffered a cross-shaped burden on his shoulders...He had bled to death on the cross with nothing but a loincloth and a crown of thorns. This film brought tears to my eyes and more tears when I even think about it. People may feel regret after watching this film, but most likely, they forget it all and continue their cruel, old selves. It's true that sin exists in nature and in man, woman, and child, but there are those who betray their families and friends. I, myself, had always believed that I should only love those who love me. But Jesus in my heart had taught me to also love my enemies and pray for their forgiveness. Christ had his entire body ripped to the bone...His head pierced by a crown of mockery and humiliation. The Christ had lived in my heart since the beginning of my life, and no matter what happens to me, I shall never deny Christ or God...not like some people I've seen. I pray to the Lord every night and I treat others with all the respect my heart can bare. I suggest everyone else should do the same. Mel Gibson had helped with this film to redeem himself and probably to help us redeem ourselves. But we never needed Gibson's film (although it was a very impressive one.) to help us understand why Christ had sacrificed himself. He never fought...He never swore...and most importantly, He never gave up. I treasure this film like no other and I hope that I shall go to Heaven in the afterlife because of who I am and what good I've done, not because I had seen this film. Gibson delivers yet another powerful film, his most powerful since Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ may be his best.

316,TensersFloatingDisk,Jesus wouldn't like it much,4,14 April 2004,"Anyone attempting a serious film treatment of an historical figure or event -- and let's be clear right from the beginning, Jesus counts, whatever your particular theological beliefs -- is in for a double-challenge. Not only must the movie succeed *as* a movie, it must also satisfy would-be historians and analysts who will be standing by to shred the accuracy of the representation and how it emphasizes its subject.Does _Passion_of_the_Christ_ succeed?Well, as a movie, it's got some obvious strengths and obvious weaknesses. The cinematography is dilligent, if not inspired (heh), the costuming and other technical aspects more than competent.  On the other hand, this very technical expertise can be problematic, particularly as the language becomes a distraction from the actual story and characterization, and as the bleakness of the setting drains much of the vitality from the experience. The acting is generally quite good, and the pacing competent (with the potential exception of the central scenes, which emphasize the minutiae of gore so very much that, once again, they distract from the real story here). Let's give _Passion_ passing scores as a movie.But it's that very attention to the violence and gore that utterly fails the subject of the movie.  Jesus' central message was, and ever remains, that one must pay attention to how one lives, not how one dies.  Death is, in Christianity as in most major religions, supposed to be a somewhat ancillary event, not nearly so important as how life is lived.  One can't help but think that Jesus would watch the movie, and the hysterical reaction of its most evangelical adherants, with despair.  ""Why are you so obsessed with the suffering which is ultimately the most transitory part of existence,"" he might ask, ""rather than paying attention to one another and to creation?""Whatever your religious convictions, there's no denying that Jesus was a significant contribution to the moral and ethical landscape of Western society.  The ultimate failure of the movie, therefore, is that it turns   a thoughtful life into a special-effects sideshow.  One suspects that those who find the film ""transformative"" or expound upon it as an evangelical vehicle, are those utterly unable to experience religious or moral thought without a fireworks display, and that they then mistake the fireworks for the religion.  It's unfortunate that this is the depiction of Christianity in this movie...and perhaps in society at large these days.",The Passion of the Christ

Of course, there is valid proof that Jesus was subjected to such. The Romans were brutally sadistic as conquerors. The Bible says that he was beaten so badly that he became unrecognizable. Yet, it seems that such a film exemplifies today's need for raw explicitness on the screen for the viewer to get the gist. Some movies nowadays portray such horrendous violence that one can only wonder about the mentality that could derive pleasure by viewing it. And that's the point. We are hard, calloused people, Christian or not. We have become use to violence. We crave entertainment that leaves nothing to the imagination. We are, in a sense, pagan Rome. Contrast this film with Ben-Hur. No other film so effectively portrays Christ. No doubt the story, with a sea battle and chariot race, serves to hold the viewer's interest, with Christ as a backdrop. But this indirect approach worked. When Heston, doomed to the galley, receives life giving water from the hands of Jesus; when the crucifixion is portrayed; and when the lepers are fully restored, we know that this tale had Christ as the main theme all along.",The Passion of the Christ

That much blood just made me disgusted. It was obviously for effect, I don't like any film that relies on gore to sell itself.I am a Christian and every year we take time on Good Friday to recognize the Passion of Christ. We read the bible account and the homily or sermon is on the meaning of Christ's facing this degradation, but we do not smear blood everywhere and wallow in emotion. Christ came to tell us to care for each other not shock and gross others out with the retelling of his death. If this film had been made with an English sound track available on the DVD and cut the bloody scenes to 1/4 their extent it would have been a film I would recommend. As it is I would rather recommend ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" before this even though it has questionable ideas. At least it challenges you to think, this film just makes you ill.

There were brief periods of beautifully done cinematography followed by what felt like HOURS of nausea inducing graphic violence. WHY? Why did the violence have to be so over-the-top and so excruciatingly long?

Jesus Christ was born to die for our sins so that we might live.  This beautiful depiction of what happened was both accurate and passionately told, according to the New Testament.  Mel Gibson has finally given us imagery to go along with the story, as told in the Bible.  I felt as if I were there.  I cried as I was saddened by the pain Jesus had to endure for us.  Seeing the Passion of the Christ makes me feel like never complaining about pain again in life.As to the comments about Jesus not being nailed to the cross via his hands, I say, watch the film carefully.

322,hitchs,It's all there,10,28 February 2004,"It is almost amusing to see the attempts to find the hidden subtexts, devious pretexts, cynical motives and religious-political machinations behind this movie, when there has never been a film so transparently open about what it is attempting to do. The key lies in the opening quote from Isaiah: `He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities.'  The motive, the passion behind The Passion, is the traditional Christian intent to help people appreciate what Jesus suffered for them and to lead them to repentance for the transgressions and iniquities that made the passion necessary.To speak of this as the definitive portrayal of the redemption of mankind would probably be to undervalue the massive qualitative difference between this and every previous attempt to depict the life of Christ. Speaking as a believer, I cannot hope to appreciate its impact on unbelievers; I can only speak of its profoundly moving effect on me and on those who saw it with me. It is, both in watching and in retrospect, the most emotionally powerful film I have ever seen.Some parts of the movie may possibly have been a little overdone  there is actually no way of knowing for sure  but the most-criticised aspect, the scourging, appears to be absolutely true to life. The shroud of Turin, for example, shows blood traces from at least 50 separate strokes of the lash, and there would probably have been many other strokes which did not draw blood. It really was that bad. (And for those who choose to  believe that the carbon 14 tests reveal the shroud as a 14th century fake, please try to explain the following: how could a 14th artist manage to create a technology so advanced that every attempt to reproduce it has failed miserably and even 21st century science cannot work out how it was done, a technology so sophisticated that, unlike every picture ever painted, it can produce 3-dimensional images on a computerised image analyser? and why, having invented this unbelievable technology, would the artist use it only once, anonymously, to create an image which would not be properly appreciated until the invention of photography five hundred years in the future?)
As for the absurd accusations of anti-Semitism, there is far more anti-German sentiment in the average World War II movie than anti-Jewish in this one. The script makes a point of showing that Jesus himself did not hold the Jewish leaders totally responsible for what they were doing, and Mel Gibson showed graphically that he held himself personally responsible for the crucifixion by wielding the hammer that smashed the nails into Christ's hands.",The Passion of the Christ

It wasn't just mindless gore for the sake of gore, it showed the true torture that Jesus went through in his final hours. I felt that it really added an emotional punch to the film.I stongly recommend this film to any and everybody. I am not a religious man, but I felt real emotional watching this. I think that you will too.",The Passion of the Christ
324,tfc,Read the book first then enjoy the show,8,19 March 2004,"To Bible novices, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" (POC) seems simplified to sprinkling the New Testament (NT) on top of a Christ who was spin, folded and mutilated into hamburger for two hours. It was shocking, violent and unsettling to the point I would not recommend to people who seek entertainment or have not already read the NT because the underlying reasons for such cruelties are missing or lightly explained. I would highly recommend POC to people who have read the NT or understand history (witch trials, purges and repression of man by man) and basically know what to expect when someone is being scourged and crucified. The violence then has meaning to the story. My main reason for this belief is that Mel Gibson mostly based the POC around the last portion of Christ's life: His arrest, his trial by the drumhead Sanhedrin, Pilate, Herod, his crucifixion, and his resurrection. Sparsely covered are the times Christ spent upsetting everyone high on the Jewish food chain by being right, wise, and nice to everyone low on the Jewish/Gentile food chain. If people have read the NT, they will understand the dozen or more times Christ chastised the ingenious but hypocritical Pharisees and Sadducees, the dozen or so times he performed miracles for free, and the dozen or so times he said some really profound things that are not shown in the POC. People will gain a better understanding why the Jewish upper crust (political maneuvering priests like Caiphas) would gleefully expedite Christ to his heavenly kingdom.  Is POC anti-Semitic? I say no. Main reason, Christ was a Jew, he lived in Judea, the Jews lived in Judea so it was most likely that the Jews in Judea would kill Jesus who was a fellow Jew. The Romans went along to prevent problems. For the people who are anti-Semitic; whom would you rather have killed Christ? Where else in the world would Jesus go and not get killed for saying we should love one another? Antarctica? Q.E.D.. I believe the POC correctly shows that it was the Jewish upper crust (2% of population?) that passionately disliked Christ and the rest of the Jewish population were repressed. A point not realized by most modern people watching POC is that back in the old days when you got even sightly hurt you could die or become crippled. Back in the pre-antibiotic days, a small cut could kill and I am sure the Romans sterilized their whips between every use. Ancient medicine could more likely to kill than cure. When the Romans professionally and expertly scourged Christ, you can see his ribs through his mangled skin. This was why the Roman leaders were so upset.  Excessive scourging could kill eventually from infection. In a way, if Christ was scourged so badly as seen in the movie, Pilate may have thought why not let him be crucified? He is going to die anyway.James Caviezel well portrayed a strong and understanding Christ. Even with one eye, you could see the ""father forgive them for they are idiots"" look. Barabbas and others would look at Christ's eyes then walk away, looking back. The rest of the cast was well selected and did not detract from the plot. The scenery and costumes were as well, very good thus showing that someone had put some thought into the project.The Devil's scenes seemed out of place but if one has read the NT, you can understand where they came from though misplaced.Overall, I liked the POC as a theological movie that provokes thought.",The Passion of the Christ
325,Cube_TX,After further review...,8,5 March 2004,"I saw this film again after over a year and was able to get a much better understanding of Mel Gibson's purpose. When I first saw the film I felt the scenes were too long, but now I see why. Gibson was trying to portray how long and harsh Jesus' beatings, journey up Golgotha and eventual death really were. Gibson pulls no punches and made this movie the way HE wanted to. He did a great job portraying the truth and didn't sugarcoat any of it. The pain and suffering was almost real to me. Many people felt this movie glorified violence too much, but how is it worse than most other graphically violent movies these days? The backlash was inevitable and hit hard after this movie was released.I saw this in theaters with my brother, whose fiancée is Jewish, and can say that the so-called anti-semitism simply wasn't there. This may offend some of the Jewish faith, but I think many people were supposedly ""outraged"" only in order to find something wrong with the film. Backlash against this film was inevitable. I'm surprised the ACLU didn't try to sue Mel Gibson.I applaud Gibson's bravery and strong beliefs in making this film that he KNEW would be heavily criticized. He got the last laugh when the box office profits came in. Thank you, Mel Gibson. May we all learn to have the same courage you do.",The Passion of the Christ
326,mrvino15,"Good to know what to expect, I say EXCELLENT!",10,7 March 2004,"Some responses I've heard from friends are that they would have liked more character development, less violence, and more story told about Jesus and his disciples and their bond.  They say they had no one to feel sorry for or mad at, etc. because no story was built in the beginning.  I can't disagree with that because that is what they wished would have happened.
However, I personally disagree.  I didn't need anything more than what Gibson offered.  It was about His last 12 hours before death, and that is what was shown.  The stories about his disciples and so forth were told to me since I was born, that is why i didn't need them now.  As for feeling sorry for Jesus in the end.  It was more than that, I felt for Him through every blow that he took from the beginning.My point is, it could be a different experience for you going into it if you know what to expect and expect nothing less, nothing more.  Understand that that it is not supposed to be a full, well-rounded movie.  It doesn't go through all the typical stages most movies do.  It starts at the end of his life and finishes at the beginning of the New.I just love this movie!  10/10",The Passion of the Christ
327,Hairy_Lime,Wewease Wodewick!,8,15 March 2004,"Just as in Braveheart some wags in the audience treated us to ""It's just a flesh wound"" the first of the many times someone lost a limb, here I got The Life of Brain in Pilate's courtyard.  No singing at the end, thankfully.And as to my views of The Passion of the Christ, I liked it; not a great movie but a pretty good one.  It kept reasonably close to John, with a few traditions from the Stations of the Cross added in.  As for anti-semitism, I didn't see it - anti-Roman, yeah, yeah, that I saw, despite Pilate's John-based reluctance to order Jesus' crucifiction. The story necessarily (to be true to John and the prophesies that he drew on for his gospel) makes the high priests - with a few notable exceptions - complicit, and early crowds back the high priests, although the horror of the passion changes the crowd's tenor as the procession moves on.  The movie's view of the crowd owes as much to The Ox Bow Incident, or perhaps Huck Finn, as it does John.Gibson presents the plot of the story in pretty much the same way it is presented in the other movie versions of the Passion that I have seen - from Zefrelli's version to King if Kings to The Greatest Story Ever Told Jesus Christ Superstar.  Instigating role of the High Priests, angry jeering crowds at Jesus' trial before Pilate, reluctant Pilate, foppish Herrod, everything.  What separates Gibson's vision is that it occupies the entire movie - flashbacks aside - and, of course, the extreme violence of it.While I think that the criticism regarding spurring anti-semitism is misplaced, those who have criticized its extreme violence have a very definite point.  The movie worked for me, but for many viewers, I suspect, it would leave nothing behind except an impression of violence.  Me, even the sight of pieces of Jesus' flesh being scourged off him by a flail I could take.  But near the end, when Jesus is dying on the cross, a crow lands atop the cross of the unrepentant thief and... oh, man, there's one thing I have a phobia about it's eyes.  Just the thought of a bird pecking them out makes me turn from the imaginary screen.  That the puncturing of his eyes only implied rather than shown is a relief.Fortunately, the same thief is seen in two later shots, with both his eyes. So either the bird missed or Gibson made a huge continuity error.",The Passion of the Christ
328,CalvinValjean,"Whether You're Christian Or Not, It's Just Plain Not a Good Movie",3,13 April 2016,"You do have to give Mel Gibson and the marketing behind this film credit; they made a film that is a very difficult to review as a film and not as a theological position. Their goal was to get people talking about Christianity and they certainly succeeded. All I can do is offer my critique and why I think this film fails.This is an extremely simplistic portrayal of Jesus and all the events of the Crucifixion. Focusing so much on violence might have worked if the violence had at least been realistic and not excessive to the point of borderline slapstick. The dramatic slow-motion is so over the top, the portrayal of Satan feels like something out of a superhero movie, and the Resurrection of Jesus is done like something out of Spider-Man. It's not an emotionally moving moment; it's just visual gadgetry. ""Gosh, look, kids. He's got a CGI hole in his hand!"" There're two scenes in particular that I find dangerous and arguably distort the message of the story: The first is Judas's suicide; instead of an act of genuine shame, he is punished by seemingly an external force of demon children. The other is the Bad Thief on the cross; when he mocks Jesus, a crow comes down and pecks his eye out. The reason these two scenes are dangerous is that they basically preach the following: ""People who are mean to Jesus deserve to be punished, and wrathfully!"" It's this same mentality responsible for so much violence in the world.Mel Gibson's vision of God does not seem to be loving but very grotesque and visceral. What bothered me was how this film was marketed into manipulating people into thinking you were being shown ""what really happened."" I'm surprised by the large number who feel they MUST love this movie if they are Christian; giving it a negative review is like saying you hate God. I'll give you an example: one of my friends loves the score of the movie and I'll admit, it's very good. But while listening to it he remarked: ""I'm becoming closer to the Lord."" Ahem, can you say manipulation?Finally, regarding the infamous issue of anti-Semitism: while I don't think the movie itself is intentionally trying to be so, the seeds of it are there, and it's something Gibson could have been more sensitive about. His drunken antics and anti-Semitic remarks subsequent to the film's release have not helped his case much.I won't deny the cinematography is great, and the use of the original languages is certainly creative; though then why are all the characters whitewashed? Why is Jesus Caucasian? If you're going to go through all trouble of making the languages authentic, why not make the film racially authentic?At the end of the day, how you feel about this movie is going to come down to your personal religion, which is why it's such a hard film to review. But for all its visual tricks, the movie is ultimately just a movie and Gibson is just a man. Neither one ""owns"" the Christian religion, nor can represent it. Now if you want to see a superior film version of this story, check out Pasolini's THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW.",The Passion of the Christ
329,schmimic,Mel Gibson directs this gut-wrenching portrayal of the final hours of Christ's life.,10,23 April 2005,"Starring: Jim Caviezel When I first saw the preview for this movie, I was a little bit afraid. Oh great, Hollywood is making another movie with their perspective on the events of the crucifixion. Just what we need. Then I saw a few previews, read a few reviews, found out who was directing, and my fears disappeared. Most of them anyway. After that I was just afraid to watch the movie due to the emotional impact I knew it would have.This movie details the events of the final hours of Jesus Christ's life. It starts off in the Garden of Gethsamane, follows through the betrayal to the crucifixion to the rising of our slain Lord.The story is familiar, so I don't think I need to detail the plot too much. The movie takes into account pieces of all four gospels, plus a little bit of Catholic literature that I am unfamiliar with. At least that's what I've been told. Makes sense, since our director, Mel Gibson, is Catholic.This movie is one of the most, if not the most blatantly gory piece of cinematic work ever. They spared no expense when it came to making the flogging and the crucifixion look real, bloody, gory, painful, horrible, and excruciating to watch. If you can watch this movie without wincing even once when you think of what Jesus went through, then you have no heart.I would warn you to brace yourself if you're going to watch this movie. If you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ and everything that he has done for us, then this movie will hurt to watch. It should. It's not a fun movie to watch, but movies shouldn't always be about entertainment. This movie is about remembering that incredible sacrifice that our Lord made for us.What makes this movie even more incredible is that it isn't done in English. All the actors are speaking in Aramaic. It can get a little bit annoying to have to read subtitles through the whole movie, but it makes a far greater impact because it makes it all the more authentic in its feel.Many critics and theologians criticized this movie for being horribly anti-Semitic. Is it really? I don't think that it points a finger at the Jewish community at all. Yes, it is the Jews that do the deed of getting Jesus thrown up on that cross, but it's the Roman soldiers that physically put him up there. They are portrayed far worse than the Jewish leaders. The movie tries to convey the point that it is not the Jews that hung Him on the cross. It was us. Our sins made it necessary for Him to be nailed to that big piece of wood.I think I'm going to have to watch this movie again. I have not seen it since I viewed it in the theater, but since it is Good Friday, I can't think of a more appropriate time to watch it.If you haven't seen it yet, I would urge you to do so. Go rent it, or possibly even buy it. Just be warned that it hurts to watch it.Bottom Line: 5 out of 4 (yes, it's THAT good)",The Passion of the Christ
330,johnnysugar,The Most Offensive Story Ever Told,1,1 March 2004,"Films about the life of Jesus Christ, the Messiah of the Christian religion, are almost always fraught with at least a little controversy.  From ""King Of Kings"" to ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" to ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"", these films have always rankled those whose personal Jesus does not match that of the films.  Sometime a movie comes along that is so personal that only those of the exact same mindset can even hope to appreciate it.  Such a film is ""The Passion Of The Christ"", which is quite possibly the most offensive and repulsive film ever made.Directed and co-written by Mel Gibson, ""The Passion Of The Christ"" is a meditation on the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus, a period documented in the Stations of the Cross in the Catholic Church (Gibson himself belongs to a fundamentalist Catholic tradition).  Gibson assumes that the audience is already familiar with Christian scripture, and for the sake of argument, so will I.  I will not try to relate what happens here, as there are numerous contradictory accounts and interpretations of these materials.  So I'll just get right into why this movie is an unadulterated punishment on good taste.The movie is violent.  Graphically violent.  Needlessly violent.  The screen is drenched in blood and viscera, and as Jesus, Jim Caviezel spends much of the two-hour film caked in fake blood.  A scene where Jesus is caned and scourged by sadistic Roman centurions lasts a full 10 minutes, each lash dwelt upon with an unnerving eroticism.  Indeed, the violence can only be described as pornographic: excessive, lovingly filmed, and designed to elicit primal emotions.  Every cut, every bruise is gazed upon with a longing that only the Marquis de Sade could possibly appreciate.  While crucifixion was indeed a violent way to condemn a criminal, the punishment merited out to Jesus is unduly severe, even for Roman law of the time, and Gibson is giddy to shove each and every drop of blood into the faces of spectators.But what about the acting and the direction?  Not since the days of silent films have I seen such an abundance of enthusiastic overacting and broad, exaggerated emotions.  Subtlety is not one of Gibson's strong points, and even with a few very fine actors here -- Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdaelne, Hristo Shopov as Pontius Pilate, and Maia Morgenstern as Jesus's mother Mary -- the performances are all either overwrought to the point of comedy or underplayed to the point of boredom.  Characterizations are extreme and nothing resembling nuance or complexity is even attempted.  Caviezel himself lacks any charisma or gravity, and even in the flashbacks where he isn't covered in 20 gallons of karo syrup, he makes you wonder why anyone would follow someone so lacking in magnetism.  Gibson also has developed a fond fascination with slow-motion, as if he thinks it's the only editing tool that can add dramatic impact to a scene.The plot, as it is, is confusing enough without Gibson giving most of the characters names.  You are assumed to have read the Christian gospels and know all the players in the story when the opening montage rolls.  Those who aren't as familiar will leave themselves wondering what in the hell is going on.  The two Marys follow Jesus throughout the film, along with one of his disciples, who is never given a name.  Gibson has taken a small part of the gospels and stretched it out to a padded, dull two hour film, adding unnecessary violence (the gospels say very little on what was actually done to Jesus) and characters.  The Devil appears as an androgynous being, played by a woman (Rosalinda Celentano) and dubbed over with a man's voice. Often, she appears in visions to tempt Jesus with imagery that appears to have come directly from Gibson's head with no meaning for anybody else.Much has been made of the film being anti-Semitic.  Indeed, many Passion plays in the Middle Ages were used to fuel the idea of ""blood libel"": that the Jews were responsible for the death of Christ, which in turn led to much Jewish persecution.  The Catholic Church has since rejected this notion, but not the order to which Gibson subscribes.  The Jews in the film hiss their desires for Jesus' death through rotted teeth, and since the film is not placed in the proper religious or political context of the time, the viewer is led to believe that the Jews hated Jesus so much that they had to kill him, when in reality, he was an unfortunate political pawn in a Jewish attempt to undermine the occupying Roman government.  But Jews aren't the only ones treated with contempt.  The Romans are all sadistic drunkards, gays like King Herod are pigs, and women are unfit for anything but weeping and looking on in rapt agony.  Gibson can't even get his languages straight, using High Latin when he should be using Vulgate, and then having his actors mispronounce what is used.This film is disgusting and repulsive on a level I can't even gauge. Besides that, it commits the cardinal sin of being stultifyingly dull. Half-way through the film, the viewer has become so numbed to the violence committed that nothing registers.  People already inclined to follow Gibson's warped view of what many see as a beautiful mystery will certainly enjoy seeing their Savior whipped, beaten, scourged, and humiliated like a party favor at an S&M dungeon.  Everybody else will only be appalled that Gibson could take such liberties with writings that many see as holy, and that he could engage in such an arrogant display of self-righteous torture. For indeed, this film is a punishment to sit through, and even at the end, you still feel unclean.This film is Gibson's own ""Battlefield Earth"" with a higher special effects budget.  Don't waste your time.  If you really want to see Christ this badly, go to a church.  And if you don't, then avoid this movie like the plague.  1 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
331,TheFilmConnoisseur,The Passion of the Mad Max,10,28 February 2004,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*Poor
Last night I attended a screening of Mel Gibson's latest controversial motion picture, The Passion. I myself do not consider this film to be anti-semitic, but I can understand why the Jewish community fears this movie. The scene depicting the Jews demanding Jesus' crucifixion can be misinterpreted by some viewers. Aside from that this is a very powerful film. A film that serves its purpose to provide an accurate account (according to the gospels) of the last twelve hours in Jesus life. Twelve hours that changed the world. Twelve hours that resulted in the horrible death of a great man. A man who lived to bring peace to this world. Regardless of whether you're religious or not this is a film that will touch your heart and put tears in your eyes.
RATING: 4 STARSWARNING: This is not an easy film to digest, it is extremely graphic, so I don't recommend it to audiences who can't handle images of graphic natures.",The Passion of the Christ
332,pvsavla,Non - Christians must see it!,9,26 November 2010,"Spell bound! Justifying the name of its title, the movie is and was made passionately. It looked more real as it was made in Armaic language (prevailing language in Judea then). The locations and acting of the actors is worth watching. It has spurred a lot of interest to know more about Christianity and to actually visit all the sites related to Jesus's crucification.It reminds one of the crucification scene shown in the movie Benhur, but the one shown in this movie far exceeds the influence on one's mind. This movie also provokes one to see all other movies made on Jesus Christ. The only drawback seemed to be the prolonged scene of scourging and it seemed superficial for Mary, the mother to not have fainted or turned hysterical while her son is being whipped in front of her eyes for such a long time.",The Passion of the Christ
333,DylansFearFiles,Probably the Greatest Movie Made About My Redeemer,10,24 June 2010,"I am an Apostolic-Pentecostal and I was washed in the blood of Christ/saved in July of 2009. I had seen this film several years ago (I believe it was 2006) and I was relatively indifferent to it but I had not had my life-changing experience with God yet. This movie is best if you are a believer and have been saved.In this film, Jesus Christ is portrayed by Jim Caviezel. The film is called ""THE PASSION of the Christ"", so one can infer it was about His death and resurrection. The film does a great harmony of the four accounts of the crucifixion. I think it is also possibly the most emotionally and spiritual impacting movie made about the Lord. The film also includes a realistic interpretation of Satan which honestly sent chills down my spine. I don't think the Devil should be portrayed as scary but it got the main part right: he is subtle in his work and not an over-the-top creature with red skin, horns and a pitch-fork.I watched this movie for the second time in March. It made me cry, my heart bled for my Savior. Every time that I have watched it since then, I have cried each time. Great movie.The film is also historically accurate. It does add some little things, such as Jesus seeing Satan in the Garden of Gethsemane or Mary, the mother of Jesus, seeing the Enemy while Jesus is carrying the cross. The film does a little subplot about Judas Iscariot, who we all know betrayed Jesus.I loved the flashbacks of some of my favorite bits of the life of Jesus such as the Sermon on the Mount (which taught great moral values and spiritual guidance which only the Son of God could give) and Him saving the adulteress from being stoned (who is portrayed as Mary Magdalene) and the Last Supper. I applaud Mel Gibson for his terrific work on the film.I admired the purpose for which Gibson made The Passion of the Christ. I read that he was suicidal before he made the movie and made this movie to remind him what the Lord did for him and what He was able to do. The movie focused so much on the blood and wounds of Christ and it wasn't just to satisfy the great love for violence today's youth has but to show that ""He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. Surely He bore our sorrows and by His stripes we are healed"".",The Passion of the Christ
334,ForReal84,Holy Moly,9,19 March 2004,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is the best film of 2004! It is a story that almost everyone is familiar with. The film follows the final hours before Jesus Christ was crucified. At first I thought the reading of a constant sub-titled film would be hard, I thought I'd be paying more attention to what is being said then actually watching what is going on. I found myself to be very wrong, yes the whole film is sub-titled, but it had little effect on me. In fact, there is not a whole lot to read. It seems that throughout the two hours there is less talking and more actions taken place on the screen. I think that this is the first time that I can truly say that for two hours I was fixed on the screen. To be honest if there wasn't all of the hype around this film, I don't know if I would have been so interested in seeing it, I thought that it was going to be one of those movies that leaves it's viewers depressed. To some this film may do just that, but for this viewer, and yes it was at times hard to watch, but I left feeling uplifted. This film is about the struggle that one man went through for us, he did this so we could live, through his death he gave us life and that is amazing part. I also had a feeling that one should always stand up for what he or she believes in, because in the end we are all the same. I know that may sound like a stupid and childish notion to take away from such a powerful film, but I believe that in the worst of times evil will fall and hope will rise. That is something that Jesus Christ has taught me everyday of my life. There were points during the movie that I wanted to stand up and jump through the screen and help him carry the cross, or stop the men from beating him. I think that Mr. Gibson has captured something on film that has never and will never be brought to screen again. This is simply an amazing film that one would have to see for themselves. I can't imagine that playing Jesus Christ is easy, but Jim Caviezel did an amazing, outstanding, perfect job. He undoubtedly has delivered the best performance of the year and probably of his up and coming career. Maia Morgenstern gave another brilliant performance in the film, she delivered one of the most heart breaking performances to date. As Mary, Jesus' mother, she plays it with such grace, in a role with little speaking lines her presence on screen in captivating. I truly believe that she and Mr. Caviezel deserve any and every award that they could possibly receive for their work in this film. Mel Gibson does a great job with the direction of this piece; he truly is a master at what he does. He is a good actor but a great filmmaker, The passion of the Christ is a movie event in history, it is an astonishing film that will stay with you for a long time. I think it is a movie that family and friends should see together, I saw it with a very good friend, and that made the experience all of more enjoyable. Together we both watched the screen in amazement, afterwards we both talked about things that we never would have had we not seen the film. Honestly, I believe that this is one of the best films ever to be made. See it today and you'll remember it forever. I give this film an A and four starts out of four.",The Passion of the Christ
335,zelda1964,a truly inspiring film to touch your heart,10,4 November 2004,"I had bought the film on digital video disc, and was truly amazed at Mr. Gibson's masterpiece. He gives the audience a heartfelt look at what Jesus went through in the last hours of His ""human"" life. The most powerful scenes were at the trial, and you really feel your heart being ripped out. When you witness the whipping and beating torture Jesus went through, it makes you feel that you were suffering with Him. I am a Christian and have seen other movies of this genre,like Barabbas, or The Greatest Story Ever Told. ""The Passion"" is completely different and makes you ""soul search"".

336,IMDBcinephile,The Despair is Established into the staging of Torture,6,23 June 2011,"To begin, I would like to admit that I'm not pious or follow any religion; I concede that I'm not the apostle of the writings of this story being apocryphal or genuine in the way it's laid out; they are sacred I know that. However, I don't don't believe that this person was so puissant that he could turn wine into water, that he was a soothsayer and that he could walk across water (it's not anything to be proud of any way being able to do that!).However, don't go astray or be reluctant to watch this piece because of the idea that ideologically it only has one side and it's not rounded (which I thought was going to be a problem for me). I looked into the streaks of expectation and had the revelation saying ""what are we really expecting from a movie with this premise?)Gibson pulls off another solid film that doesn't quite go for the generic Blockbuster label or follow the foot steps of any of the Mummy remakes; Jesus is a man who is disparaged and considers the role of kind. The movie is appropriately in a Jewish language, and it shows the struggle through it all and the conflicts with the devil (slightly in a subliminal way under the subtext; the movie does try to get us to feel his presence). By the impugned intolerance, prejudice and purported envy, they do not look into Jesus' path thoroughly; they use force against him.With this movie, it's not on par with Biblical epics like Spartacus (1960), Ten Commandments (1923-1956) or even The Prince of Egypt (1998) namely and personally because the real predicated subject and character was not of some omnipotence but rather the shadow of innocence and hard work who wanted to subvert or undermine the system to lead the people to safety (Moses does have the power to sway water away but he is not as powerful as Jesus). I'm sure you understand what I am saying.... But this movie doesn't pander to the notion that he's so powerful. It's notion that, not quite at haste and harshness, but under the consideration of prejudice and bigotry that the only way for these people to prove their superiority is by whipping the person who won't oppose it.There is, in essence, two sides to coin actually and it's whether or not you can accept this, which I feel personally may have caused a turbulence for people; I can accept it though but it's whether or not I can choke up to it as well.It's on such a grand scale. Gibson has employed a construction of architecture that reminds me quite vaguely of Babylon in ""Intolerance""Another character is of course Mary, The Mother, leaves an eerie presence; there is another woman who is almost a counterpart of Satan as well. They cannot be ignored. When she witnesses her son is being pulped and in pain, she and he remembers how she chaperoned him as a wee boy as he fell to the ground and under her arms was quite potent - ""He will return and make everything better"" - though thankfully this is only addressed once, we know that he could alleviate himself of the pain; he repaired Judas' ear and also he's invulnerable until he died either naturally or by God's command.It does drag, but it is impossible to look away. It does have a Silent Film Power that excels many other movies that were out in 2004, however, it does lend itself to gratuity with some unwarranted amounts of violence.He stipulates and commands for his Father, I was thinking at what cause? And as I mentioned I think the movie has proved that the reason he died; but it did raise a question: Didn't he get stabbed through the arm pit? And then he did just for the accuracy that he was did and well, it gives it authenticity to the story. My favorite bit is just after his death, a drop of water is reflected from the lens as it pulls back into the crane shot and we see it hit the ground. You could say parenthetically that this is a celestial body but to me it signifies the end of the civilization. Until of course that was debunked by the inevitable outcome.But to be fair, the movie is unpretentious in preaching the story (to which it doesn't do much of that at all actually). It can be looked at as a beautiful film in spite of the whipping scenes - but what it all comes down is that it falls under a subject matter that can be contentious.I recommend to watch at your own will. Judge what you see. It is violent and the potency of it pervades through the mercilessness of it, not through an overflow of blood.",The Passion of the Christ
337,HulkVader,Just a movie.,1,29 March 2004,"Nothing more, nothing less. Not a religious experience and, frankly, not much a moving one, either. Simply proof that after you tell people what they want, you can shove it down their throats no matter how distasteful it is and the flock will smile and say, 'Thank you, sir, may I have another?'Passion is just another Hollywood Jesus. With a laughable Hollywood Satan, to boot. Hollywood. For instance, curious how every Jew in the film  save Jesus, Mary & Magdalene  were of the proper skin tone for the time and region, darker than Caucasian. However, those three: nice white people. It's so sad how simple they think we Americans are. This just one of several artistic flaws in the film. Another of the more subtle were the thieves in the film crucified aside Christ were done so with nary a scratch on their bodies, to further illustrate the singular pain of Jesus. Now that's a wily director manipulating his audience, yet again. In truth, the Romans tortured thousands. Many thousands never made it off that torture rack alive. Sadly, Jesus' suffering was no different than that of any of those poor souls. A movie that will probably never be made (to such level of notoriety, anyway) would be one about how many hundreds of thousands of people the Christian church has tortured and murdered since. On that note of notoriety, fulls marks for marketing with the movie being pushed as 'The film the Jews don't want you to see.' Aside from the false conspiracy theory, Gibson exploited yet another American fondness: our thirst for blood. He, himself, is obsessed with torture and physical trauma (see: Braveheart, Lethal Weapon, Road Warrior, and Payback  especially the scene with the sledgehammer that was absent from the original screenplay and inserted by Gibson himself). And Gibson knows Americans love blood. This movie is not much more than a car wreck on the freeway that drivers can't turn away from. However, the blindly devout can embrace this car wreck because it carries the guise of religion. Sure, there's a lot of blood in the real world, so what's the harm in portraying some of that? A better question is what's the benefit? This movie is not about the message of the man, Jesus. Not by a long shot. This is a two-hour snuff flick. And one that will gross the ridiculous Mr. Gibson around $300M. This film is historically, theologically, morally and artistically dubious, not to mention one of the worst films of this or any other year. Rating: 1/10.",The Passion of the Christ
338,yoyomagoo,Theatre of Pain,5,2 April 2004,"Coming to us in a blaze of controversy, The Passion Of The Christ may be, and is, a lot of things. But one of these things is not boring.You're familliar with the story. Suffice to say, this version is drenched in gallons of blood and features some of the most disturbing looking children you will ever see. However, this is probably the movie's main downfall. By the time we get to the crucifixion seen, it is fair to say that the novelty of the ultraviolence wears off. The violence has lost it's effect leading to the most important message of the film being drowned out in a sea of monotony.The film's failures don't end there. While the director of photography has done a very fine job with the visuals, it seems that they belong to a different movie altogether. The cinematography is always clean, crisp and beautiful. This grates with the extreme violence we are shown, and seems to undermine the darkness of the film.The cast is decent, with Jim Calvaziel making a particularly striking impression. The direction is brilliant at times (the flogging scene is hugely powerful, as is the use of flashback), heavy handed at others. The repeated use of slow motion and choir-like music is massively irritating. It's almost as if Gibson thinks the audience needs to be reminded the fact this is story is Important.However there are two massively objectionable things in the movie. The first is the depiction of the Jewish authorities, who unlike all any of the characters in the film (with the exception of the devil) are seen to be pure, almost the eptiome of, evil. The other, is the heavyhanded treatment of the ""end"" of the story, where Mel Gibson employs cliche so pretentiously, only a religious film could get away with it. The last shot of the movie reminded me of a bad superhero film.The Passion is brave, beautiful and memorable, but fatally flawed. Despite the performances and a couple of superb scenes, this film comes across as monotonous and empty. The spiritual message seems to have been sacrificed in order for a level of violence so excessive, it makes Death Wish seem understated.",The Passion of the Christ

""The Passion Of The Christ"" is the most controversial film of this century, but I respect the people who don't like this film. 1. It's not as acurate as some people may think. 2. The violence obviously. 3. The crucifixion and his death.  One of the last scenes is the crucifixion. This scene is enough to give you a heart attack.  As he remembers his last words he said to his friends, the nail pierces into his skin and the rest you already know. His last words as their nailing him to the cross, ""They know not what they do, they know not what they do."" This scene will inprint itself in my mind for years to come, this scene makes me realize that Christ died for us and thats all there is.

340,jaesboxer,A Personal Review (You Can't Do Much Else For A Movie Like This),3,28 January 2005,"I am not a Christian. I have recently converted to Buddhism, but at the time I saw this film, I was simply Agnostic. I decided that, despite the mixed reviews and controversy, or perhaps because of them, I just had to see this one. Now, I had not read the Bible cover to cover, and had only a vague knowledge of Jesus' life and death. Therefore, when I saw the Passion, I took everything in it for fact. This led me to question how I could have ever denied Jesus was the son of God? Of course, after doing a little bit of research, I discovered the factual basis of this film, and of the bible in a historical context, is weak at best. Just as Passion fever was hitting high fever pitch, I discovered Buddhism and converted. The next time I saw the Passion, I had read the Bible cover to cover, done research on the historical Jesus, the basis of Biblical anti-semitism, the accuracy of the Gospels etc.. Thus, watching it again, I finally developed a concrete opinion of the film. I will not say it is this, or it is that, for a film like touches everyone differently, but I found it, upon second viewing, to be little more than a glorified snuff film, gratuitously violent, inaccurate in many respects, definitely anti-semitic, over-indulgent and very weak. How many times must we see Jesus fall upon the route to Golgotha in slow motion? How many times must we see him hit and whipped by the Roman guards? The certain things I did not like about the film include the script's portrayal of Pontius Pilate as a conflicted man under pressure by the Jewish mob (he was later removed from his post for being too cruel!). I also did not like the way that Caiphas was shown, as a savage Jew jealous of Jesus' sway. A certain portion of the Gospels shows him mentioning the rebellion that could result from Jesus' power, thus inviting the slaughter of thousands of Jews. Thus, instead of a man concerned for the welfare of his people, Caiphas is merely a bloodthirsty Semite. And certain sections, such as the whipping scene (were the fish-hooks on the end of the whip really necessary?) are incredibly drawn out. The whipping does not end until Jesus' entire body is ripped with deep rivers of blood. Another torturous scene is the Crucifixion itself, in which we not only see close-up shots of Jesus' hands being nailed to the cross, but we also get to witness the dislocation of his arm, the nailing of his feet, his being crushed under the weight of the cross, and his being stabbed and raining blood upon the watchers (A note: there is a major factual error here. I don't care what the scriptures say, a person could not be crucified by having a nail driven through his hands. The weight of the body would tear right through the hands. The nailing was done between the two bones of the forearm, they could have at least got that right!). In fact, I think I can only say two good things about the film. The first is that Jim Caviezel (a performer I have always admired) is probably the best screen Jesus to date. The second is that, amongst all the scenes of torture intended to be moving or stirring, the only one that actually affected me was the scene in which Jesus, exiting Jerusalem, falls under the weight of his cross, and Mary, remembering a fall he had taken as a child, comes running to his aid. This is a beautiful scene, but there is nothing divine or holy about it. Rather it shows the beauty and sorrow that a mother feels for her Son, and personifies Jesus rather than idolizes him. Ultimately, I feel sad that, for a man who lived such a great life and taught so many wonderful doctrines on human brotherhood and love, the focus of the general public should be on his brutal execution. I mean, the entire concept of Resurrection is given only about 30 seconds of screen time at the very end. And though certain shots of Jesus teaching appear throughout the film, they are horribly offset by the violence between them.",The Passion of the Christ
341,JohnBoyRoy,This films speaks for itself...,9,4 April 2004,"There has been a massive furore over the release of the passion.  Well, even before its release it had been criticised or adored by the so called authorities on the story of Jesus Christ.I just wanted to share what I gained from the film with the imdb community, and to speak a little about the formal excellence of it.For me, a born and raised (but not practicing Catholic) The Passion did not feel like a film made for religious audiences, exclusively.  Yes, I had a better understanding of the character actions and motivations (for example, why Peter was a character I felt sorry for, yet had little screen time in which to take this stance) compared to other viewers.This is no bad thing - Gibson manages to wrench enough performance from the cast to assert weight to emotions that we have not seen grow over the past months.With regard to the accusssations of anti-sematic messages: absolute bollocks people.  It would be hard to set a film in Jerusalem that didn't feature a single Jew, but the fact is that there are plenty of Jewish characters (including the religious leaders) that don't agree with Jesus' unfair punishment.  Gibson shows that the real blame laid with a couple of corrupt high ranking priests, afraid of loosing their grip of repression on the general Jewish public - the true nation of Israel if one is being picky.Do we accuse every film not featuring Jews as anti-Christian, or anti-Muslim, or even anti-atheist if their are morally corrupt individuals in a collective?  Exactly, any level headed Jew will not be offended by The Passion at all, and I don't want to beat one up because I've seen the film, only pond life would consider it.On the flipside of this, the film is not necessarily a preaching Christian picture.  I think that Gibson set out to portray Jesus the man - and what he had to offer us.Jesus, be he Go or not, belived in what he stood for; and true or not, was crucified (in his mind at the very least) for humanity.  When you see just how horrible this was, you'll agree that the bloke was an absolute diamond. Gibson uses brilliant inter-cutting to show how Jesus' crucifiction woulkd preserve what he preached: Love, Friendship, Charity and Hope.I'm not overly religious, but I think that JC had a few good things to say to us - and that is Gibson's message, to open peoples' eyes to what occurred (in history ad well as the Bible).The violence is not excessive - it is historically accurate, and if people wish to deny man's savagery to man then this is not the film for them. Its as simple as that.My favourite sequence in the film was in the midnight garde.  THe sense of atmosphere created is electric.  I also loved the flash backs, they were highly emotional (especially the one involving motherhood) and provided respite from the horrific Crucifiction - during which my heart was pounding. I can compare it to the end of Braveheart - it was even more unsettling and tragic though (and obviously more visceral).  Don't believe the criticism of Gibson's use of slow-mo: its all so well shot that it allows you to study perfect framing, exposure and compstions.  It also prolongs the agony, which is good, in my humble opinion.Jim's performance is stunning, totally belivable, humble and subtle.  THe supporting cast also shines, especially the vile Roman soldiers.  The Aramaic and LAtin fit in perfectly, the film given much more dram by their inclusion.  It does not distract eiether - the script is to the point and unclogged.This is a brilliant film, with and importatn message, and should be respected by anyone - not just Christians using it as a cynical marketing toy.Mr. Gibson, I salute you, you're gonna be one of the great directors (and ""Tim"" was s**t hot!)9/10 peeps.  Go get some of it in!",The Passion of the Christ
342,orourkec-292-269155,"Passion of the Christ is no brilliant film, but it undoubtedly has its merits and works in its own right as a watchable film.",6,8 February 2015,"In what is positive about the film, I think that Passion of the Christ's most positive point is its stunning violence and that's in the scene where Jesus is being horribly slashed to death, for what seems like an eternity, by his captors! Watching this scene felt like it was really me, as Jesus, being slashed eternally and I just couldn't bare to look at that scene! It was just so horrific and unjust the way Jesus was tortured! This violent torture scene deeply impacted my mind. I also thought that the depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus's life was respectful and well done because you could really see what Jesus was thinking during his last 12 hours' life and his way of thinking during those moments are both noble and realistic to how he might have thought in real life during the last 12 hours of his life, and it was also pleasant poetry. Sadly, while Passion of the Christ has all of these advantages, it greatly suffers from a lack of powerfully felt emotions and drama, caring for all of the main characters, unclear message(s) and an ultimately brilliant, significant and influential piece of cinema and a film that could bring all audience people into unity. Passion of the Christ nevertheless works in its own right as a watchable film. My rating for Passion of the Christ: 6.1/10",The Passion of the Christ
343,sjwest,"Mad Max' To The Passion'  From So Ridiculous It's Good To So Sublime, It's Brilliant.",8,9 April 2004,"Last year was the year of the sequel and the comic character adaptation. Now we have something that is an adaptation of one of the world's most well known stories, but it is nature of the adaptation itself that makes this movie stand head and shoulders above anything thing else that you will see this year, if not for quite a few years to come. There is no accommodation for audience mass appeal. At face value this may seem to be a strange statement considering that Mel Gibson is using a story that has been deeply discussed many times between different cultures the world over. What I mean by this is that there is no sprucing up of the story to cover a higher demographic count. There is no girl meets boy, boy eventually wins girl over for the woman or fashionable character to tap into the current audience trend. There is also no watering down of the story. We see what happened as told through the ages and witness the horror and brutality of the times. Indeed this is the movie that we have been waiting a long, long time for.Mega successful movies are the result of the careful crafting of the components of story, images, sound and, of course, acting. Here we have these elements blended together so finely that not one stands out above the other. For sure, this movie will etch itself on the mind because of its intense graphic scenes of violence, but without the strength of the other elements we would have only been witnessing a movie intent on shocking the audience rather than a movie that wanted to communicate a message, that is, the suffering endured for the sins of man. The sublime craftwork created a movie of substance thus giving the audience a truly unique experience.
The movie opens with the scene at the garden of Gethsemane. The scene is a mesmeric one awash with ethereal blue light and mist giving the audience a sense of mystery and the anticipation for the rest of the scenes is immense. The use of lighting is used once again in the High Priest's house where he stands before the council in the presence of the teachers of the Law and the elders. Here a gold  like swath of light is used to augment the authority of the gathering, but at the same time it did not dilute the raw emotion of all within the courtyard. This clever use of artistic methods of storytelling also helped to accentuate the period of the story. Satan's presence is also ingenious. It is not ever  present, but it is there, hovering, waiting and enticing. Sometimes, producers can get carried away with the use of special effects which would have only served to undermine the story. The Satan character would have been a tempting opportunity for the lesser artist. Restraint exercised was restraint rewarded. 
All the actors were unrecognizable to me with the exception of Jesus, who was portrayed by the character actor, Jim Caviezel. This was an important and extremely effective tactic. Blockbuster stars may secure backsides on seats, but they may detract from the nature of the story and of more importance to Mel Gibson, the message. The story was the star here and with the objective of authenticity, actors who were ideal for the characters of the story were cast.Jim Caviezel is a man who radiates a sense of mystery and intense inner pain. That is what made him such a good choice for the role. He never got carried away with cries of agony which was necessary for the character that was enduring pain for the good of man. Overacting would also have negatively affected the longevity of the movie. His eyes were doctored with some brown lenses and at first seemed to distract, but ultimately accentuated the deep aura that radiated the man.  Further to the quest for authenticity was the use of the language of the time and for the benefit of the audience, the insertion of sub  titles. This was another key success factor and was absolutely no hindrance to my enjoyment of the movie. It is without doubt the prime contributing factor to the transporting of the audience to another time, another place, that is, the time and place of the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus. What a welcome change from the era of remakes and sequels. The typical Hollywood spruce  up is now being given a substantial challenge in the form of authentic storytelling. No user comment on this movie would be complete without a profound discussion on the brutality of the violence rained upon Jesus. As previously mentioned, the core objective of the movie was to indicate to the audience the suffering of the man. How would this have been achieved without showing just how cruel people were in those times? Messages against smoking and drunken driving show the tragic results of these types of substance abuse. These messages are powerful since they show people the reality they may face if they persist with habits that have negative effects on the human body. The same principle is applied here. Mel's message can only carry weight if he authenticates the historical references which could only be achieved with the inclusion of these graphic scenes. They are scenes of necessity, as dictated by the quest for authenticity and the message.As with all movies involving religious material, there is controversy in the form of the handling of iconic characters or groups of people. This is the nature of the world we live in and there is a lot of intent within material to disadvantage certain groups. I did not feel that this was the intent here and thought that the producers of the movie were all consumed with the objective of telling it as close as possible to the way that it occurred. This is, of course, my opinion, which is the opinion of someone who loves to watch movies and to critically analyze them which is my own purpose here rather than to expound a theological interpretation of the material.Whatever color, creed or religion, The Passion Of The Christ' is by far the best movie you will see this year. From the eerie setting of the garden of Gethsemane to the unworldly harshness of Golgotha, you will be unwittingly lured into a brutal world to witness the sad and deeply moving events within the last twelve hours. You will not be spared a single lash, a single drop of blood as all will bear witness to the cruelty of mans quest for power and for the appreciation of the masses. Stories such as these were meant to move people and you will leave the cinema amongst a group of people who will be quieter than the norm because they have just witnessed a movie beyond their normal experience. Sugar  coated Hollywood offerings are fine to escape the monotony of our everyday existence, but we also need a movie to make us think and feel. If you have not already seen it, see it quickly before the talk waters down the experience for you.",The Passion of the Christ

I don't care one way or the other over the controversy of how Jews feel about the movie. As far as I am concerned, Mr. Gibson has every right to display whatever his conception of Christ is. By the same token, those that disagree with him have every right to create their own movie displaying their viewpoint. I am glad that it has brought about a religious awakening.Was the violence necessary to do that? I don't think so, but now that it has come out with all that violence, let's make the violence worthwhile by showing what Christ taught and accomplished in his life.All the movie does is portray the manner and circumstances of Christ's death. Would it not be more important to tell of his life, what he accomplished and what he taught? I am thankful for the religious awakening that Mr. Gibson has brought about. But now that he has done that, I would hope that he would give us a prequel or two to show us what Christ taught and what he accomplished to make all that violence worthwhile.Without knowing what Christ taught and accomplished in his life, there is little point in demonstrating all the violence.",The Passion of the Christ
345,carlgt1,Gratuitous Violence Does Not A Religious Experience Make,4,4 April 2004,"OK, here are the major problems with this movie:1) ""pornographic levels"" of gratuitous violence, so you are just numb from being inundated with graphic images.  My best analogy would be if Mel Gibson filmed the horrible killing in Iraq in minute detail, say from shooting, firing up the cars, dragging bodies through the streets, tie bodies up on bridges while kids dance around.  All in Technicolor close-ups and slow-motion.  Or it would be like a 3-hour long watching the Hindenburg disaster in 1938 up close & personal.  It basically reduces the Christian religious experience to ""wow, Jesus had it nasty, he went through all that for you"" whilst ignoring the horrible human (and religious history) all around the world of people dying & killing in horrible & disgusting & nasty (even nastier than what Jesus went through) for ""what they believed in.""  If it were, say, a ""slasher film"" being released like this (i.e. this level of detail etc) it would be banned worldwide or at least get an ""X"" rating.2) The use of the ""Satan"" character and the ""demon-baby"" effects are absurd and are at the level of 20-year old horror flicks, in addition to making things absurdly simplistic.  Similar to the absurd scene of the ""bad unrepentent criminal"" on the cross who happens to have ravens pluck out his eyes for his ""blasphemy.""  3) It just doesn't ""scan"" --- so we are to believe God loves everything & everyone fully --- but the worst humans in the film aren't as bad as this psychotic evil and petty ""God"" who causes this mess in the first place!  I mean, how can Judas & Pontius Pilate or Caiaphus be really that bad if they are just pawns in the game of an omnipotent God?  It's like calling disgust watching ""Faces of Death"" as a ""religious experience.""  For all of those raving about how great this is I wish they'd go and watch something that has a ""religious experience"" and can hopefully make them think such as Ingmar Berman's ""Seventh Seal.""",The Passion of the Christ

The love that Jesus had for us is so evident, I could not help but be moved. You also know from Satan himself, that the Jews did not put Him there, Every human on this Earth that ever was born or ever will be born put Him there. And if you have to get picky about it, the Romans are the actual ones who placed Jesus on that cross. ""I did this to him"" were the words that kept popping into my head.

348,artemis_5,"An Eye-Opening, Deeply Moving, and Brutal Piece (possible spoiler)",10,18 March 2004,"It is very difficult to emerge from this film unchanged.  Yes, it is brutal, but it is also moving and thought-provoking.  And for all his taste for gore (even the most hard-core Mel Gibson fan has to admit he does not shy away from violence in his films), Mel Gibson can be subtle as well.  Just by the way he does a shot, or the expressions on the actors' faces, he reveals much.  Just look at the scene where Mary Magdelene first meets Jesus: she is surrounded by hostile people, she reaches out her hand to touch the foot of the only man in the crowd who has shown her compassion, and then looks up to see his face for what probably was the first time in her life--and the audience feels the sense of awe that the real Mary must have felt in seeing the real Jesus for the first time.      Gibson's formula for a good film begins with his casting.  Although virtually everyone in the cast was unknown when cast (Jim Caviezel may have previously been known to audiences as The Count of Monte Cristo), they fit their roles perfectly.  The ease with which the actors seem to assume their roles, the cinematography, the music, and Gibson's ingenious decision to do the film in the ancient languages actually spoken by the characters (although there is some quibble that the Romans actually spoke Greek at this time) gives the audience a sense of having actually been there. 
     This film is packed with moving and powerful moments, and I have heard of even the most hardened movie-viewer being overcome with emotion.    In the end, maybe the film is resented by some because it puts a mirror up to humanity.  As the Romans were driving the nails into Jesus' hands, I cried not only for him, but for all those times that I was unkind to someone else, and the realization that we emotionally crucify each other every day.  As for the charge that it is anti-Semitic, I found nothing to suggest that.     Every film has its faults, and this movie is no exception.  I agree with critics that the flogging scene was too long and too much to take inspite of the breaks.  I also think that Mel Gibson would have done well to have given more background on Jesus' life.  Having been very impressed with all the performances, and particularly with Jim Caviezel's, I thought that it was a pity that we did not get to know them better.  Some people have jokingly suggested a prequel, but I think that in all seriousness, Mel Gibson should consider doing one.  He made his point about the passion (and made it very well!), and now would be the time to elaborate more on the life of this man/God that he has made even non-believers care about.

What happened to Him was brutal beyond description, and this film spares no possible details.
I gave this film a 9 since it wasn't perfect, but last night when I was falling asleep, all I could see was Christ's bloody face. All I could think of was the sacrifice He made for humanity, a humanity which hasn't always appreciated His selfless love. If I were to factor in how my faith has been strengthened, I would give this cinematic tour de force a perfect score.In closing, I must add I hold nothing against my Jewish neighbors. Nobody should.

350,Skeptic459,Manipulative propaganda masquerading as religion.,3,20 April 2004,"The problem with religion is that when it is filmed the followers of that religion lose all critical distance. I am an atheist and can easily maintain an objective distance from the material. I have sympathy for religious people who will never look at the flaws of a film because it is important to their faith. I myself find it really hard to be critical of Terry Gilliam's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,' even though I know it is a noble failure of a film.  I like the book so much I just think it is a good film and do not look at its flaws.  I was not going to see this film but the controversy just would not die down! So, I wanted to find out which side of the debate I would be on. Is this a great film that powerfully exhibits the central message of the Christian religion? Is this film anti-semitic? Are Jewish groups being too sensitive? I was reading reviews that were all vastly different in their interpretation of the film. As a result I became very curious. Martin Scorsese's 'Last Temptation of Christ' was also extremely controversial when it came out. This film was about exploring the psychological make up of Jesus and his message. It was controversial because Scorsese dared to portray Jesus as a flawed human being and not some sought of superhero.  I thought that the Passion might be a similar case where the message had been portrayed using a controversial angle. This version of Christs story is controversial for a typically American reason, the violence. When I think of the messiah. I tend to think of the good things he might have done. He stood up for the little guy. The  lepers, the sex workers, the poor and neglected. He stood up against a corrupt establishment that cared only about money. Jesus could be a passive version of Che Guevara! Jesus was certainly not a money hungry televangelist. I also have never understood the Catholic fixation on pain and suffering. I would focus on the mans life, not on the horrible way that he died.  This is where the film fails, it is so gruesome that Christ's teachings take a back seat to extreme physical violence. I have seen this happen in two other films, the infamous 'Baise Moi' and 'Irreversible.' Both focused so much on violence that the message was almost completely drowned out. 'The Passion' is as violent as these two films and I don't understand why it needed it to be.  I found the Passion offensive because it bordered on emotional rape. When you see someone being brutally tortured it causes you to react in an extreme way. 1+1 does equal 2. Unless you are inhuman, you feel empathy, how can you not? Even if it had been Chuck 'I'm more wooden than Chucky' Norris up on that cross I would have still felt really bad. However, Mel Gibson doesn't want to simply show Christs plight. He wants to, through violence, brutalize the viewer, so they will submit to his extreme Catholic ideology. Personally I thought the violence was self defeating because it reduces the alleged messiah to nothing more than a screaming, groaning punching bag. 
 What also makes this film manipulative is that Gibson removes the viewers critical distance by placing the emphasis on the image. Remember Leni Riefenstahl's 'Triumph of the Will.' That was another film that focused on music and image. It was a brilliant piece of propaganda that encouraged emotion rather than critical analysis. The whole thing plays like an early music video. 'The Passion' is no different. Gibson stated that the images should be the guide. Sometimes there are no subtitles further demonstrating this fact. There are many shots in slow motion and there is actually little dialogue. Again 'the Passion' could be a very long Christian music video. All of this helps manipulate the viewer into just emotionally reacting to all of the images of horrific torture. It discourages the viewer from actually questioning what is taking place. Gibson has stated that this is the absolute realism of the crucifixion. Give me a break! How many bits are thrown in for artistic good measure? How many times does Satan actually show up in the new testament? How many evil demonic children actually chased Judas? These are all bits that have been added in. Gibson cannot have it both ways, he cannot put fake bits in and then state that he is being realistic. This picture is obviously Gibson's own interpretation and it is an interpretation that is full of hate. I do believe this film is anti-semitic. Pontius Pilate was recorded in history as an absolutely brutal man. A man who even Tiberius said should calm down on punishing the Jewish population. Here he is portrayed as a soulful man whose hands are tragically tied. A man who actually broods over Jesus...GIVE ME A BREAK! Pilate would not have given a second thought to crucifying Jesus. The Romans did not mess around. They thought of the Jews as ignorant, militant savages. Any Jews that resisted were brutally killed! It was that simple! What strikes me as odd is that the Roman policy on execution normally meant that the entire family would be killed. This ensured that no one would come back to take revenge. In the bible this obviously does not happen. I wonder why? Please e-mail me if someone knows the answer.  Then came the scene where the Jewish crowd is baying for the blood of Jesus. They do this not once, not twice but THREE times! I almost walked out. I have never walked out of a film. So, I wasn't going to let Gibson try my patience that much. What made me angry was that it is like Gibson is screaming at the viewer, 'LOOK AT THEM! OBSERVE THEIR TREACHERY! LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID TO JESUS!!!' It is Caiphas who is really vilified, this man receives all of Gibsons wrath and is portrayed as treacherous and evil. Gibson gives lip service to the Jews by having just TWO priests stand up for Jesus. The Jews are portrayed in that same old tired stereotype that the Nazi's loved so much. As money grubbers who are looking out only for themselves. Even King Herod and his court are portrayed as decadent, foolish and disgusting. The gospels may portray things as being this black and white but I severely doubt it was ever this clear cut. The gospels were controlled by the Romans weren't they? Therefore they abdicated their responsibility. It impresses me that Jewish groups have not protested this film more vehemently. Israel's current policies with the Palestinians may suck but the Jewish people do not deserve this kind of covert hatred coming from Gibson and his Father. This is a film that goes so far as to portray Jewish children as evil demons. In fact, that moment where Judas is being chased I realized   what a superstitious world religious people live in. Where common physical signs, such as the moon or a bird, can be interpreted as symbolic. Bizarre. Symbolism and semiotics are great in art but in real life?                 
 What is also bizarre is that the teachings of Jesus come back as flashbacks. We get Jesus washing feet and telling everybody about love. Then the viewer is thrown back to the incredible violence that exists in this film. Maybe you just have to be Catholic to get 'the Passion.' What the viewer ends up learning from this film is that Gibson has an obsession with martyrs, masochism, blood, retribution and extreme violence. You can observe all of these themes within all of his films. What amused me is that if you were from the planet Mars, the end scene could be interpreted very differently. You can just see the sequel tagline 'Jesus is back and this time it's personal.' Next thing Jesus teams up with Bruce Willis and they go and deal to the evil Jewish and Roman state. The sequel is then called 'The King of The Jews Dies Harder.' Or 'Hard to Kill.' All of a sudden Jesus has a pony tail and a pot belly. This film would appeal to Torquemada. There is only pain. It is a depressingly bleak film that does not carry the hope, love, forgiveness or redemption that you expect of a story from the new testament. We are virtually told that Jesus died because of those bad Romans and Jews. To me, what Jesus was trying to do was not portrayed. This is because the focus is on death. You could never accuse Mel of being one of those Christians who sings in the street and acts like a crazy hippie. This guy is like a cinematic inquisitor.  My conclusion is that this film is anti-semitic, has no idea about history in an academic sense and in my opinion is barbaric. I would have given the film a five but because of the hatred hidden within it I will give it a 3.
 I am not anti-religion but a film like this makes me 'thank god I am an atheist.'  Just as a postscript, at the end of this film when the lights came up I looked around the movie theatre. This film may be a restricted 16 picture here in New Zealand. But there are still whole families with young children watching 'the Passion.' This is like taking your kid to 'Irreversible!' It disgusted me! But I forget people are much more comfortable with extreme violence than extreme sex. Western culture is more comfortable with fighting than fu**ing. We are all screwed up!",The Passion of the Christ
351,madbeast,A Brutal Snuff Film,2,5 May 2012,"I finally saw this film after years of assuming that it would be just a brutal snuff film without any spirituality or affirmation of Jesus' teaching and philosophy. It starts out promisingly, with a vivid depiction of Jesus' capture and the apostles' various reactions to it, but it ultimately descends into tiresome scene after scene of a man – and it could have been any man - being beaten into a bloody pulp.The great shortcoming of the film isn't its graphic depiction of Christ's suffering. It is the fact that not a single character grows or is even strongly affected by seeing it. Many of the onlookers express shock at what they are watching, but it is the kind of reaction any human being with a conscience would give at witnessing someone being sadistically beaten to a pulp. The fact that it is Jesus who is undergoing the torment makes little difference. Keeping in mind that literally thousands of people suffered similarly gruesome punishments during this era, the film completely fails at showing its audience why this man's torment was unique.The experience isn't helped by the bland presence of Jim Caviezel as Jesus, who lacks the charisma and spirituality that actors like Robert Powell and Max von Sydow brought to the role. Flashback scenes showing Jesus in Biblical reenactments have curiously little impact. The only interesting performance in the film is Hristo Shopov's conflicted Pontius Pilate, whose place at the center of deciding Jesus' fate provides the only moments of drama in the entire two hour running time. But an unfortunate result of casting such an interesting actor in the part makes the snarling Jews who demand that he carry out Christ's crucifixion come off as one-note monsters, giving validity to complaints of the film's anti-Semitism.In the final analysis, I found ""The Passion of the Christ"" to be a pointless enterprise, completely devoid of any point of view about Jesus' suffering that it went to such great pains to depict. As the final credits rolled, I felt that I had just seen a brutal snuff film without any spirituality or affirmation of Jesus' teaching and philosophy.",The Passion of the Christ
352,MikeWright75,Brief and to the point,10,4 March 2004,"What can I say?   Beautifully photographed, brilliantly executed and acted. Get's deep into your heart, whether you are religious or not.   Most biblical tales move most people at some level, but this is something else.   Loved it. Moving, and unbearable to watch at times.  Compulsive and compelling.
I'm not a fan of subtitles, as the viewer tends to miss the more subtle nuances of expression from the actors whilst following the text but the choice to use Aramaic dialect was wise, adds a whole new dimension to the movie, takes you right there and holds you there.    Brutal and pitiless,  heart wrenching and beautiful.   Makes you wonder if you shouldn't ever sin again.",The Passion of the Christ
353,LG72387,'The Passion' is a masterpiece,10,4 September 2004,"To begin this review, one must acknowledge that I was very hesitant at first to see The Passion of the Christ. After all, the film is littered with controversy from it being too anti-Semetic to the extensive overuse of violence by Mel Gibson. However, I had heard that in seeing the film many people were moved by its emotional spectrum and the extraordinary power of the story. As such, I decided to see The Passion and try to judge it as a film and not a source of controversy. After watching it, I have concluded that all the accusations against this film are totally false. Indeed, the film is littered with graphic violence especially in the scourging of Christ. However, it adds to the realism of the story and creates a powerful effect upon the audience. There are some sequences in which the violence is absolutely shocking and what you would like to do is just leap out of your seat and scream at the top of your lungs for it to stop. But that is what makes the film so powerful. Mel Gibson refuses to let you shy away from such reckless violence because it is based on actual fact. Jesus suffered beyond recognition and died on the cross for the salvation of our souls. Gibson's depiction of the last twelve hours of Christ's life is without a doubt the most graphic, the most violent and the most realistic interpretation of the Bible story ever put onto the big screen. It doesn't hold back anything and brings with it a feeling of extraordinary sorrow within you that you feel as if it is you getting beaten right there along with Jesus. Those who are Christian should be embracing the sheer magnificence of this film because it is the first film to actually TELL Christ's story without holding back anything. Gibson's film is the definition of everything we believe in and to disregard it as some piece mindless, violent and gory trash is ignorant and selfish of the audience. Those who are not Christian will discover a well-crafted, flawlessly directed masterpiece that should be recognized as one of the best films of the year. Indeed, when one sees this, one is not seeing just a film but is also seeing a work of art, a true masterpiece that will down in the annals of cinema history. In 50 years, it will be compared to the likes of Schindler's List and Lawrence of Arabia for its sheer pageantry and graphic nature. But for now, I would accept this film as a Best Picture nominee come next February. Oh, and Jim Caviezel's Christ is perhaps the single greatest performance I think I've ever seen since Robert De Niro as Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. Caviezel conveys to the audience everything that Gibson tries to present. He presents the pain and the suffering to an extent that the audience believes that he is Christ. Without that emotion, the film is nothing. Maia Morgenstern as Mary is wonderful and deserves a Best Supporting Actress nomination, as does Hristo Shopov in the Best Supporting Actor category as Pontius Pilate. But all this would have been impossible without the direction of Mel Gibson, a man who fought the controversy to create a film of sheer brilliance. Gibson deserves a Best Director nomination and should win. The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel and the music by John Debney are also magnificent. The Passion of the Christ is a visually dazzling, superior epic that is indeed one of this year's very best films and also one of the very best religious films ever made. Accolades to Mel Gibson for giving us this masterpiece.",The Passion of the Christ
354,JCBar,Perfect in Intent,10,15 September 2005,"I don't understand the criticisms this film has received. It's too violent, it's too literal, it's not about the 'gentle' Jesus, it's not about the Resurrection, it's upsettingetc. The film is about the last hours of Jesus' life  pretty clear. Mel Gibson expressly wanted the film to be about Jesus' suffering. His viewpoint (which he said over and over again) was that not enough people actually realized what suffering a crucifixion entailed, and that through the ages, it had become sanitized and watered down so much that all most understood or thought was that Jesus eventually suffocated on the cross after being whipped.Mel Gibson made that quite clear when he was making the film, and it was quite clear as he was trying to find a distributor - that this was a film that wasn't going to shy away from the graphic agony Jesus suffered.Now about the other main criticism  it's anti Semitic. I don't find it to be, although I'm not Jewish, a scholar, nor particularly bible knowledgeable. I do know that it follows some bible versions. That the Romans crucified Jesus at the instigation of the Pharisees and the crowd is well known. I don't find it relevant criticism  the film will not sway anyone one way or the other regardless.I found the film to be almost perfect; not necessarily as a movie however, but in conveying what the filmmaker wanted. In that aspect it was. While I don't believe that the scourging needed to be as drawn out as it was, that is really the only criticism I have. The director wanted us to experience what a crucifixion was and he succeeded. He wanted us to see Jesus' suffering and he did. And thankfully he ended the film well with a 'restored' Jesus. The film makes us feel, suffer, cry, and eventually be joyful in a renewed Christ. I'm not sure what else was necessary.",The Passion of the Christ

356,HarryWarden,"""It is as it was."" Hollow.",2,26 February 2004,"'The Passion of Christ' is a movie that tries VERY hard to be important and moving, but is WAY too over-the-top to have any real emotional impact. It's the classic case of a film that drowns in it's own style and excess.
The main problem is that everyone in the movie is a caricature. There's not a trace of actual humanism anywhere in this film. Jesus and all his followers are portrayed as perfect saints and every antagonist is a cartoonish villain. From the mega-evil Barabbas, to the saintly Pontius Pilate, to the overly-sinister Jewish High Council...everything in this movie is a completely exaggerated black-and-white adaptation of The Gospels. Sadly, all the anti-semitic controversy was just the result of Mel Gibson's bad characterization. And what was up with Judas getting chased by CGI demons? Or the goofy devil baby? Or Satan screaming ""Noooooooooooooooooo!"" in Hell when Jesus dies? Scenes like those kicked the film from epic historical drama down to the level of a TBN 'Omega Code' movie.But it's when Mel Gibson kicks in with Christ's suffering that the film completely loses itself. Some of the moments of torture might have actually been disturbing, had he not cut to over-acting bucktoothed Roman soldiers laughing every five seconds. And there is only so much you can show before it all becomes tedious. How many times can Jesus fall down in slow-motion before the impact is gone? I didn't pay much attention to Mel Gibson's interviews or the surrounding controversy...but, in the end, 'The Passion' just seemed like the confused and biased perception of a crazed zealot. Skip this...and go rent 'The Last Temptation of Christ' or 'Jesus of Nazareth' - two MUCH better films. Or just go see 'Club Dread.'",The Passion of the Christ

I recall the previews for this movie was of controversy, but also highly recommended. Being Catholic helps, as we all know this story, so the fact that the movie was not in English did not matter. The casting of Jim Caviezel is inspired, because I did not see the actor, I saw Jesus Christ. The flashbacks was a beautiful contrast to the horror of the final hours. Even now I flinch EVERY time I watch the flogging scenes. Some might say that the bloody scenes were too much. Maybe. But it certainly got my attention. It's the only movie I've ever seen that left me speechless at the end. And now I make it a ritual that I watch this movie every Easter.",The Passion of the Christ
358,Tarasicodissa,Gibson has made a sign that will be opposed...,10,6 March 2004,"...and certainly a means by which the innermost thoughts of many were revealed.  Especially the secular anti-religious critic types who piled in on it.Gibson has made a Christian movie stripped of Cecil B. DeMille sentimentalism.  Frankly, I always thought that many of those old Biblical movies were hypocritical ""sword and sandal"" movies which pushed the envelope as far as they could about showing skin before nudity but threw in some phony piety so the Legion of Decency wouldn't go ballistic.  Had he made a cotton candy movie depicting a hippie Christ (or Hollywood would have preferred a gay one) preaching about how everyone should be tolerant and inclusive of everyone else and have plenty of self-esteem, Hollywood and secular anti-religious types would have had no problem with that.  They just love to talk about God's love. They hate talking about God's judgment or sin or sacrifice or repentance or the need for divine grace.  All that Christian stuff strikes them as ""judgmental"" and ""insensitive"".People who whine that the violence ""detracted from Christ's true message of love and forgiveness"" ignore the fundamental truth that Christ's message WAS the cross.  Christ was born to die as the sacrificial Lamb of God.  He was born to take upon himself the full weight of divine wrath for all of your sins, my sins, Stalin's sins, Hitler's sins, Pol Pot's sins, etc so we could have a chance to start fresh.  The cross wasn't an afterthought.  It was the Divine Plan from the very beginning.  Gibson has had the courage to tell this truth.  Those who ignore it have watered down Christianity into a kind of ""self-help, self-esteem"" slop.",The Passion of the Christ
359,Tarasicodissa,Two additional points,10,14 April 2004,"First...A correction to something someone said earlier. An earlier poster said that Mel had erred in having the soldiers talking in something that sounded like Italian and was willing to concede that the actors were Italian so it sounded that way.Mel was absolutely right.  You see, the textbook Latin, Classical Latin, was not the same language that common people spoke in the Roman Empire.  Pontius Pilate, because he was upper class, spoke Classical Latin because he was an educated man.  The common people spoke what is called Vulgar Latin and it is what the Romance languages are derived from.  Vulgar Latin did not have the declensions and grammar and syntax of Classical Latin.  It was much simpler.  It had articles unlike Classical Latin and a syntax like Romance languages.  So Mel was absolutely right to have the common soldiers speak Vulgar Latin, a kind of proto-Italian.Second...The cultural significance of this cannot be underestimated.  I am reminded of the Pope's first return visit to Communist Poland.  The whole nation turned out to welcome him in such vast numbers that people who had felt isolated in their Christianity amidst a fiercely pagan political culture realized that they were NOT alone, they were NOT a minority.  They were in fact, the majority and the power was theirs if they wanted it.  That is where Solidarity came from.  With the tremendous success of this film American Christians have seen their economic power and with that comes cultural power.  TPOTC has effortlessly left every other movie released this year in the dust.  The Cultural Left threw everything it had this winter against Mel Gibson and this film, resolved not only to make this film a flop but to make an example of him by destroying his reputation and career.  Christians saw this and seethed.  In response to the Cultural Left's maximum effort, the Cultural Right made a maximum effort and the result has left the Cultural Left speechless in shock.  Millions of people who never go to the movies poured out of the woodwork to see this film.   A huge and lucrative audience existed that Hollywood had completely ignored with simpleminded special effects blockbusters pitched to teenagers.   The Cultural Right has demonstrated its power to make something a colossal hit that the entire secularist Hollywood community wanted to see fail.  This will have big consequences.",The Passion of the Christ
360,ven2s,Gripping and inspiring,10,25 February 2004,"In a time of hollow heroes who sell out for the almighty buck, finally we see the true Hero who sold out to the Almighty and Gave his life for everyone who would believe in Him.   Although touted as extremely brutal and violent, I would say it is no more violent or shocking than Saving Private Ryan or Alien.  I think why many are so shocked by the brutality of the crucifixion is because they have been spoon fed, whether by religion or the media, a sanguine version of Jesus' sacrifice.  In fact, this movie does not even go far enough into the excrutiation of a crucifixion, a torment that could last as long as a week before a person finally succumbed to suffocation and exhaustion caused by being suspended between nails in the wrists and feet and pecked at by birds and vultures!  But it gets the experience across!  More importantly, it communicates the depth of God's love for us in that Jesus, as Divine as He was and in His Humanity, loved us with every fiber of His Being to the very end and to Life forever!By the way, don't bring your under aged kids to this.

361,t-h-fields,It's Fun Without the Sound,1,14 January 2007,"As most of you know, the dialog in this movie is all in Latin and Aramaic, in order to lend it some kind of ""authenticity"". Those two dead languages must have posed real challenges for the actors. Anyone familiar with Christian mythology knows the story anyway, so you can dispense with the dialog. The soundtrack is rather dreary and depressing, too.So when I watched this movie, I turned the sound off and put on some music instead. My selection was some excellent Dixieland jazz. Good time music. Party music. For a gore-and-splatter movie like this, my drink of choice is a Bloody Mary. I make them very strong. About halfway through the show, I ran out of vodka and switched to gin. It was just as good, either way.Anyhow, back to the movie. Where was I? Other reviewers have pointed out some of the movie's many flaws. Mel Gibson's anti-Semitism is plainly evident. And he's hard on the Romans, too. I couldn't resist thinking about that scene in The Life of Brian when the rebel leader asks ""What have the Romans done for us?"" The violence and gore are so grossly exaggerated as to be unbelievable. No one could have survived the brutal treatment that Jesus receives long enough to get to the Crucifixion. Everything in this movie is carried to absurd extremes. In short, it's nothing more than a propaganda film.It's not even good propaganda; the obvious intent here is to preach to the converted. It was made for them, not to convert any skeptics. In fact, the movie has little to say about Jesus' life, or his teachings. It barely touches on these subjects, and even then it's only through a few brief flashbacks (they provide just enough time to pour another drink).If you want a real historical film about this subject, see The God Who Wasn't There, by Brian Flemming. There is no solid historical evidence that Jesus actually existed. The so-called Gospels are simply recycled versions of more ancient myths about other gods and prophets.For gore, splatter, torture, and sadism, this movie ranks way down my list. See Bloodsucking Freaks, Hostel, Cannibal Ferox (aka Make Them Die Slowly), Premutos, The Burning Moon, Violent Sh*t, Man Behind the Sun, The Untold Story, or Dead Alive. They are all better than this junk.Well, after several drinks I began to forget what a piece of trash this movie really is. In fact, the music provided an excellent sound track, and made it very enjoyable. Sometime, I'll try watching it again with some Bourbon and some modern jazz, or perhaps some tequila shots and salsa music. Maybe I'll eat the worm during the Crucifixion scene.Thomas Edison said ""Religion is all bunk"". I agree, but sometimes it can still be entertaining.",The Passion of the Christ
362,stanclimbfll,wow,10,1 March 2004,"When I saw this movie I knew it would be gory. But I also knew that was very much like what Jesus went through for us. The violence wasn't there for our enjoyment (because there are some who like to see other people suffer), it was there show how much love and passion Jesus had for us. I was blown away.
Mel Gibson did a good job. The actors did well learning the language. Reading the subtitles didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.Every Christian should see this movie.

363,js1801,IMPORTANT,7,21 July 2019,"The Father and the Son are the Parents of the Holy Spirit, literally or metaphorically. The Trinity is a Family---literally or metaphorically two Parents and a Progeny literally or metaphorically, similar to a human family.(Humans are made in the ""likeness"" and ""image"" of God according to Genesis 1:26, although the human author of Genesis probably didn't know about the Trinity when he wrote Genesis) In the book of Job, which is in the Bible, God is compared to a father and a mother with a womb ""From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens?""-Job 38:29. Because we can think of God as like a mother (Isaiah 42:14, Isaiah 66:13, Matthew 23:37, Catechism of the Catholic Church 2nd edition paragraph 239), all three roles in a basic human family(father, mother, progeny roles) are filled in the Trinity. Saying that the Father and the Son are literally or metaphorically the Parents of the Holy Spirit is another way of saying ""the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son"" which has been official Catholic teaching for centuries. The Church teaches that the Son is begotten by the Father. If this is correct, the Father is the Father(Parent) of the Son. The Church teaches that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. If this is correct, the Father and the Son are (literally or metaphorically) the Parents of the Holy Spirit. The Catechism of the Catholic Church (second edition) paragraph 246 says that the Holy Spirit's ""nature and subsistence"" is ""at once...from the Father and the Son.""If the Church calls Mary mother(parent) of God even if Mary isn't the first source of Christ's humanity(God is the first source), then the Son can also be called (literally or metaphorically) a Parent of God (the Holy Spirit). I think that the Father is the principle-Parent and the Son is the begotten-Parent(literally or metaphorically). Some early Christians thought that the Holy Spirit was the Mother-figure because in the languages (Aramaic, Hebrew) that Jesus spoke (during Jesus' time and through at least the 4th century), Spirit was a feminine noun. (Some languages like Spanish assign genders to genderless nouns) The scriptures are vague if the Holy Spirit is the Second or Third Person of the Trinity, whichever of these is true, the First and the Second may be (literally or metaphorically) the Parents of the Third. Parent definition from Merriam-Webster dictionary: One that begets or brings forth offspring. Principle means base/foundation/first-source/first-origin/root-cause. The Church teaches that: Father, Son, Spirit are eternal (have always existed) and the Father is the Principle with regards to origin, not time. We can say that: the Father is the eternal Parent of the eternal Son, and that the Father and the Son are literally or metaphorically the eternal Parents of the eternal Spirit.",The Passion of the Christ
364,E-Z-Rider,Misnomer,7,15 March 2004,"Whatever else this film may have, passion is not among them.  (Yes, I know ""passion"" in this context doesn't mean emotion.)  Though the violence is brutal and graphic, it is curiously devoid of emotional content--there is a detached quality about Jesus's character that makes him seem beyond human suffering, and hence beyond human compassion.  Sure, the scourging is bloody and protracted, and the crucifixion scene is gruesome, but Caviezel renders such a detached performance that it's hard to feel much empathy.  Of course, this is an inherent tension in portraying Jesus as both man and God, but other movies involving Jesus--Ben Hur, for example--manage to make a much deeper emotional impact without being nearly so graphic.  The other main characters, too, seem strangely detached. The only character in the movie who seems real--and shows genuine suffering--is Judas who, from the first moment on-screen, shows ambivalence about his decision to betray Jesus, then regret, then despair.  A remarkable performance by Luca Lionello, an Italian actor I've never heard of before, but one worth watching.  The film is beautifully shot, and the use of Aramaic and Latin do add verisimilitude, but in the end the movie left me cold, and I was seldom moved to think back on it after I left the theater.  Perhaps Mel Gibson is counting on viewers to bring their own emotional content to the movie, and doubtless many do, but in the end the director has failed to give us any new insight into Jesus, his life, his suffering and his death.  Which is too bad because, whether one is a Christian or not (and I'm not), the story of Jesus does have much of universal significance that a creative artist could explore.  The film is no doubt popular in large part because it gives Christian believers a graphic representation of the events central to their faith.  But it is a missed opportunity to reach out to those who do not already share that faith.  And this is very much contrary to the universalist tenets of Jesus's teachings.",The Passion of the Christ

The sad part is perhaps emphasized a bit much in Mel Gibson's style.  The violence and abuse done to Our Lord during the last 12 hours of His life as a human on earth are a bit too much for most of us to imagine.  I, personally, dislike the technique of putting excessively violent moments into slow motion.  It's just a bit too much emphasis on the pain, and not the reason for the pain or suffering.I'm very much satisfied that the movie portrayed quite well the fact that Jesus went to suffer for all of us, and to obey His Father God in Heaven who sent Him here for just that purpose.  The embodiment in the film of this message is brilliant.  The fact that Satan was there in the garden is something I had never contemplated before, but I said ""Of course!"" after I saw it presented on screen.  In the Bible it does say that Satan would return at a ""more opportune time,"" so there you have it!My favorite part in the whole movie is the end where he gets up and has that determined look on his face and walks triumphantly out of the tomb!  Yeah! There is HOPE for all of us because of Jesus' sacrifice and His obedience to His Father.Simply marvelous.  A very worshipful experience.",The Passion of the Christ

This, in my interpretation, forges a quite beautiful link between Judiasm and Christianity, as this question and answer, or some variation of it, is recited at traditional Passover Seders to commemorate the beginning of ancient Jews' escape from their Egyptian overlords, but could also apply here to those of us, including myself, who are believers that Christ was and is the Son of God, as we see this night as the beginning of our ""freedom"" from eternal death and the end of our ""slavery"" to sin.This film has been criticized for its level of violence; I read one other reviewer who commented that this film was for people who ""like pulling the legs off of bugs"", or something to that effect. This, of course, is the common attitude of people who misunderstand what the story of the Passion of our Lord means to those of us who believe in Him. It is not about taking pleasure in His or anyone else's pain; it is about an admittedly painful reminder of just WHAT He was willing to endure for (we believe) our salvation. It is NOT about ""sadomasochism"", ""anti-Semitism"", or any other negative thing; it is about LOVE, SALVATION and, again, LOVE. In fact, the kind of LOVE that would drive our Lord to do what He did can only be spelled in capital letters; it is more than we can comprehend.Now, on to the performances. Mr. Caviezel was absolutely magnificent. Never have I seen a human face, on film or in reality, that looked so brutalized and yet so peaceful, even in the throes of agony. Whether you believe Christ was in fact the Saviour or not, his performance is the embodiment of infinite, unconditional LOVE, peace and grace under the pressure of unimaginable physical and emotional abuse, and, in the flashback scene between Christ and His Mother, JOY! Yes, there is joy in this film, albeit briefly, as Jesus shares a laugh and a kiss on the cheek with His Mother (after obediently washing His hands before entering their home to eat). Caviezel is amazing, and the other actors are up to par with him. And, for all the brutality leading up to it, the depiction of the Resurrection is simply breathtaking - so much so that it made me forget the horrors immediately preceding it.See the film with an open mind whatever your beliefs or religion. Do not believe the negative things you have heard (if you ever believed them) and perhaps, if not Christian yourself, you will come to understand what this Man means to your brothers and sisters in humanity who do take Him as their Saviour. God bless you all (whoever you are, whatever you believe).",The Passion of the Christ
368,TonysLittleFriend,Some Good Friday,7,3 September 2004,"GOOD GOD! (no punt intended), this movie pretty much sucks! I'm not gonna go into a Biblicale scale in terms of how this movie made me re-think my believes, considering, it didn't. The film tries too too hard to be emotional. I found myself reaching for the tp, rather than the tissues. Well, here's the basic plot:The Passion of The Christ focuses on the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. The film begins in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after sitting the Last Supper. Jesus must resist the temptations of Satan. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Jesus is then arrested and taken within the city walls of Jerusalem where leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a condemnation to death.Yup. It's all about Jesus. Who else. I'm not gonna spend all my time and your time telling the story of how I went to go see this movie. Too long. Even Jesus would get bored. The whole film is subtitled. No horrible dubbing, none. I'm sorry to be the party pooper Mr. Gibson but...THAT'S GAY!Now on the other hand, the violence is...well....violent, with a capital V.Half the movie is ""Esta xícara é o novo testamento em meu sangue, que é barraca para você"". The other half is an all out blood and guts fest! At times the violence gets so intense you can begin to see J's ribs when he is being whipped. But overall, this movie brings nothing but a headache, and a un controllable urge to whip your brother/sister.**/****",The Passion of the Christ
369,JasonT413,"This film is about love, not hate. Historically sound. Accept it.",10,26 February 2004,"In my opinion Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ is one of the bravest films made in the history of cinema. The films subject matter is handled in a beatiful manner and as a whole it is an honest probe into historical fact. It is a probe into the search for truth. This is something the character of Pontius Pilate asks himself and his wife in the film in relation to the situation of this man Jesus of Nazareth.The people who cry 'anti-Semitic' are hipocrates and crybabies who probably have not even seen the film. To me they reflect one of the characters of the film, Simon of Cyrene, who is ordered to assist Jesus in carrying the torture stake. At first Simon looks at Jesus and wants nothing to do with him, in Simon's probable view, his fellow Jews have already accused this man of being a lawbreaker and is someone who is already condemmed to die. His religious leaders have mislead him into hating instead of loving. No questions asked. But in helping Jesus, by coming in contact with the man (bruised and battered as he is), he sees something, he feels something is not right here. Just why was he made to die? By helping in carrying the torture stake, by sharing in the experience, he comes out a changed man. What was once opposition, has become more of an understanding. More love, less hate perhaps.This films message revolves aroung love. The greatest act of love that many feel was ever put into motion in this universe. That is what the film is about. It is historically sound. It is not completely accurate, but nevertheless very accurate. It is the most accurate film on the subject yet. The folks who cry 'anti-Semitic' would probably prefer the film not to come out. It reminds me of the mass book burnings by the Nazi's. It is the same kind of spirit.Mel Gibson is a brave filmmaker and a great one. He is one of my favorite along with Steven Spielberg (see, I'm not 'anti-Semitic'). Three cheers for Mel Gibson. We need more brave (in the true sense) men like him in cinema today.",The Passion of the Christ

IF there were ANY historical record by ANY contemporary the this time period of a crucifixion of a person named Jesus I would still rate this as a blood and gore, over the top depiction. 
But sadly, it is pure fiction. Gibson made a ton of money with this manipulation of non existent events.

One don't have to have ""The Faith"" only echoing some seen screenings are correct so far. I was awestruck with accuracy the truth of a man how he sacrificed to point of such agony none of us would go to such lengths for the love of mankind.BTW, though I didn't know James Caviezel's work, I thought he did a find job depicting Christ IMHO. BTW, those more interested in where Mel Gibson got his inspiration for this movie is from a $18.00 book from TAN publishers called, ""The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ,"" based on visions from Anne Catherine Emmerich a Roman Catholic visionary. Just to give some perspective of the background. Also, this is not bashing out Jewish brethren. It's that at THAT TIME they were the spiritual and political authority of the THAT time, with Romans influence as well. Hope this helps us all in these unsettled life threatening times, learning to love one no matter what the cost!

The torture Jesus underwent was brought to life in this movie and was so real. It was a very painful movie to watch but it is a film that everyone should see at least once to see what Jesus went through so that they can understand his love and have an attitude of true gratitude. The only thing that disappointed me about this movie is I wish that the movie had showed more of Jesus's teachings and healing and more of after he rose from the dead instead of only focusing on the torture. I think it's important for people to know what Jesus did for them but I think it's also important to see his teachings and how he rose from the dead. This is, however, an excellent and powerful film that everyone should see at least once.",The Passion of the Christ
373,standardbearer,"Butchery? Blood? Guts? Well done, but still CHEAP !!!!",1,8 April 2006,"Making a movie about someone like Jesus Christ, is maybe the cheapest thing to do. I mean he was maybe the most influential person in the history of the western world (I mean in the history of western culture), and whatever is a movie really about, every last person would at least take a look at it.SO, if a new film comes out, and it has nothing new to offer about this man, than it's really just cheap waste.Well the ""Passion"" HAS some things new to offer! Well really, it should be entitled as maybe the ""Vivisection of Christ"", or ""The Passion of someone in great pains..."". For that is the story: Some Romans beat the living material out of this poor Jew, who seems to be Jesus himself, for they call him that way. (Satan itself appears sometimes too!!!! wow! And it makes silly faces!!! Well thats tempting!!!)The scariest thing about this movie was the reaction of all audiences. They seem to get enlightened, and call this movie inspirational.I just don't get it. Are there this many serial killers / slashers out there? For who else would find it inspirational to watch a man being tortured to death??? No, I'm not a good Christian, not a Christian at all, not even a religious person, but i always thought, that Christianity culturally determinating, because it has been the base of European culture for centuries, so it is important to know about. Thats what I thought until i saw this film, and faced the hysterical mass of people, who had their life changed by this roll of celluloid. For this is a pile of fertilizer. It has nothing to tell, except 'how to ruin a human body in two hours?'. Its not about religion, not about culture, its not even about Jesus, nor the bible. Its 'bout GORE ONLY.I really don't know what to say. Maybe those poor Christian bastards couldn't watch any gore/exploitation movies when they were young, because of their priests, teachers, and religious parents wouldn't let them. They would say, that a good Christian'd ignore these violent works of Satan (you know, that bald guy). But then came along 'THE PASSION'!!!! Finally, Christianity could watch gore and exploitation!!!

374,jeek,"Way to go, Mel!",10,8 March 2004,"I don't know much about religion.  I was raised Protestant, but never took much stock in church, therefore I'm no expert when it comes to religion, so I'm not going to argue facts.  What I find so amazing about this film is that Mel Gibson spent his own money to make the film he wanted to make.  It takes a hell of a lot of courage to spent $25 million of your own cash after Hollywood tell you 'you're crazy,no  way' and continue on with a cast of no-names and subtitles. The production quality, the acting, costumes, and Caleb Deschanel's photography are second to none.  I always took Mel as an action-superstar, but now I include him in the same league as Spike Lee, F.F Coppola and other directors who give the middle finger to Hollywood and make the films they want to make.As far as the view that this film is anti-semitic, all I can say is Jesus was a Jew. Christians understand that Jews aren't responsible for his death; we as sinful humans are responsible for his death: me and you are responsible for his death, but through his resurrection we can have eternal life (that's about the extent of my religious understanding). Christians understand that Jesus was born to die, therefore I don't think mobs of Christians are going to be running in the streets burning down synagogues.Regardless of your beliefs or lack thereof, go see this movie.  If you don't believe in religion, go see it anyway for the fact that it is a powerful, intense and beautifully filmed movie.",The Passion of the Christ

I went to see this movie in expectation of being MOVED. Someone,perhaps,being inspired..and besides, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Let me just say this first, That the actor portraying Jesus,was good...It would have been more rich and rewarding if the picture concentrated more on the life and lessons the Jesus taught because I think the actor would have really brung Jesus to life,instead,we are given a sadistic,appalling,and over the top movie of the last days of the Christ life on earth. WHAT was MEL Gibson thinking?!there are some visually compelling moments in the film,but then there are uses of the slow motion camera effect,that I wondered,why use it HERE?? Did Mel just discover this cool ""tool"" and decided to sporatically insert here and there?!!!SHEEEEESH!!!!! Now, don't get me wrong. I love and respect most of Mel Gibsons films,but THIS was VILE. Ok, in no way did I get the sense of anti-semtics,that some critics were implying,yet if any group of people that SHOULD be kind of p***ed are the italians..(ROMANS)..I tell ya, when the Roman soldiers are torturing Jesus all I could see are those thugs from the Sopranos and Goodfellas who were such sick people getting JOY from hurting someone else. Let me say finally, PLEASE dont take your kids to see this movie. I had to sit next to some people who did and let me tell you,it was horrific.Kids shouldn't see this...if they want to have their kids experience the life and the sacrifice of Jesus..then Maybe they should read the BIBLE to the kids which gives a far more accurate account of his life.",The Passion of the Christ
376,ghigau,Marcel Marceau does the crucifixion,4,12 March 2004,"Great cinematography, but irritating music score and a near absence of dialogue. Gibson does a bit of a ""Battlefield Earth"" Travolta ego trip. Someday they will pass a law preventing actors from becoming directors, but until then we are doomed to mediocre movies. Clint Eastwood took years to get good at directing. Gibson does expand visually on biblical text, but loses his courage when it comes to going past cliche Bible quotes. He lets Jesus be too one dimensional by sticking to writings that were made centuries after he was martyred. When history leaves a blank space, the writers and directors are supposed to fill it.

Most people failed to realize all of that does not matter because Jesus Christ never existed!! Jesus Christ is a mythological figure the church has exploited for hundreds of years and now the film-making industry has taken advantage of for almost one hundred years. Absolutely no historical or archaeological evidence proves that he existed. Even if Jesus Christ did exist, it is highly unlikely he would have received that kind of punishment. How shameful a con artist like Mel Gibson used this mythological character to make millions and millions of dollars.

378,Urantia,A Bloody River of Lies,1,11 February 2011,"This movie is a shamefully disgraceful, graphically violent example of everything that is wrong with a religion that tries to drown the teachings of Jesus in a bloody river of lies. Jesus revealed God as the Father of each human being and when once you grasp this idea of God as a true and loving Father, the ONLY concept which Jesus ever taught, you must forthwith, in all consistency, utterly abandon all those primitive notions about God as an offended monarch, a stern and all-powerful ruler whose chief delight is to detect his subjects in wrongdoing and to see that they are adequately punished unless some being almost equal to himself should volunteer to suffer for them, to die as a substitute and in their place. The whole idea of ransom and atonement is incompatible with the concept of God as it was taught and exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The infinite love of God is not secondary to anything in the divine nature. Even if God were the stern and legal monarch of a universe in which justice ruled supreme, He certainly would not be satisfied with the childish scheme of substituting an innocent sufferer for a guilty offender! The barbarous idea of appeasing an angry God, of propitiating an offended Lord, of winning the favor of Deity through sacrifices and penance and even by the shedding of blood, represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive. What a travesty upon the infinite character of God, this teaching that His fatherly heart in all its austere coldness and hardness was so untouched by the misfortunes and sorrows of His creatures that His tender mercies were not forthcoming until He saw His blameless Son bleeding and dying upon the cross of Calvary! It is an insult to God to believe or teach that innocent blood must be shed in order to win His favor or to divert the fictitious divine wrath! These ancient errors and pagan superstitions about the Universal Father's nature represent a doomed philosophy destined for rejection by enlightened truth-seekers.",The Passion of the Christ
379,Cheesedemon28,"really well made, now let's work on subject matter, please.",1,9 March 2004,"Well, to Mel Gibson's credit, The Passion of the Christ is a really well-made film. It's got the good stuff: production design, sets, music, it's good. Really good. Like above most modern Hollywood standards good. The problem is that the rest ofthe film is so mind-numbingly stupid that I have to give it a four out of a ten. Anything higher would be overrated.My reasoning is this: Jesus didn't die for our sins. In fact, I doubt he died for anything other than being a good guy. And I doubt his death was this violent. The bible is no more than musing on life, a fiction novel to live by, so I strongly doubt that Jesus was even real. And yeah, the film is really violent. I've said it once, I'll say it again: I am a fan of Battle Royale, in which a 13 year old's genitals are stabbed nearly eight times, another's throat explodes, two other's crotches are cut off, and two are shot to death and then their screams are amplified through a megaphone they wereusing to try to preach peace. The Passion is worse. It's clear that Mel Gibson has a serious torture fetish, and I wish he wouldn't use such a huge religious figure to try to make it legit.If you can't look past most of the bs in the film to get to it's core: a bloated snuff film that uses controversy to be successful. Mel Gibson's intrests are torture, money, and being an above average director.4/10",The Passion of the Christ
380,mercybell,"An emotional, visceral, cinematic masterpiece",10,2 March 2004,"10/10I think this is the most powerful film I've ever seen, and it makes me respect film, the cinematic medium, more than I ever have before. I think it's a film ofimmense emotional magnitude and I would undeniably consider it to be amasterpiece. This is an intensely personal film that strikes you in the heart, and flanks you with images of brutality and beauty, evil and good, cruelty andcomplete, absolute, love. It's a cinematic masterpiece.First of all, I loved the sound of the Aramaic language. I loved the Latin spoken with hints of Italian accents and without the academic dryness that has haunted it for so long. Who knew dead languages were so poetic? These languagesadded a great deal to the whole experience of the film. We experience this film, instead of watching it. We break through and take part in it, similar to how we can take part in theater. Maia Morgenstern broke my heart over and over again in this film, the motherand child connection was so strong, loving, and beautiful, and yet so sad and heartrending. Mary's strength in the face of overpowering sorrow in this film was incredible, her warmth and love emanate from the screen. I fervently hope she receives Oscar attention, because she is amazing and an inspired choice forthis role. And James Caviezel did something incredible, he portrayed Jesus as a man of joy (not goofiness), solemnity, strength, and dignity (not austerity, detachment, or stoicism) but most of all, an all encompassing love, even in the face of immense suffering. And yet despite being God, this Jesus is not asuperman; Jim made The Christ very human, and as a human, very vulnerable,which makes His, human, strength all the more incredible. Caviezel was perfect, and I hope he is well rewarded next year.Morgenstern and Caviezel's chemistry is a genius stroke of filmmaking. Jesusneeds His mother desperately, and she must find the strength to support Himeven though it is her greatest suffering to watch, and yet she is strong. It is beautiful, and it touched me deeply. It is a most human and universal of feelings, the parent-child bond, and here we see it put to it's greatest test. Through the connection we see on film, we are given a vehicle of understanding, of empathy, and it makes Mary and Jesus identifiable and familiar on a whole new level.I think the pace was very swift, it was over before I knew it, and although it was very violent, I do not think it was tedious or gratuitous. I found the mechanism of violence to be a necessary part in the story being told, and yet I felt it all, which is kind of new for me. I've watched a lot of violence and gore, and I guess am desensitized to it. But I found this to be more painful than standard ""action"" violence. I think it was the closest to feeling pain without feeling it. I find ""Gladiator"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Kill Bill"", and ""Black Hawk Down"" muchmore violent, in a certain way: with the detached limbs, broken bones, guts, and brains etc. Everything here is a prolonged beating with blood, but nothing is decapitated except for a guy's ear, and we hardly even see that. In fact it's the implication of pain (the sound effects, yikes) which makes this so effective. Most of us don't know what it's like to get a foot blown off, but it's easier to imagine getting whipped by something, or getting gravel in a bleeding gash, or hitting a bruise really hard. Pain is the key here, and I think through the violence we are shown the evil of violence, which gets lost in a lot of films, because here we are made to empathize in a very visceral way, in addition to emotional: we have to see what He went through for us, and do we see it. I don't think I'll ever forget. And I think there was more pain Gibson could have added that would still have been authentic.I did not feel, as many critics said, that it was an ""angry"" film. I think it was the complete opposite. It is brutal and intense, but I found the message of Love in this film to be incredibly powerful and the crux of the whole thing: that through all this, Jesus never had hatred in His eyes. It doesn't need to be explained, mere glimpses in this speak more than pages of dialogue; that has always been adevice I've loved - the power of the human face. I felt that the numerous acts of kindness and love from strangers, be they looks or gestures or even more, inthis film drove it further and lifted the audience from the savagery, which they are meant to do. And I didn't find it anti-semitic at all, in fact if you pay attention there are quiet a few details and elements of scenes in the film to point out the fact that the Jews as a people were not liable for Christ's death. I would explain, but space does not permit. But as I pointed out above, this film doesn't try explain many things to you, because it expects it's audience to pay attention. So pay attention,everything you need to know is there: you don't need to know the names of the people who are kind, but just to see that they are kind. There are films, that aren't ""2Kool 2"", that expect you to pay attention anyway, and details, subtle as they are, are suitable, wonderful, devices for a complex, meaningful narrative. I shudder to think of the day that everything needs to be exposed and explained 15 times apiece. It's beautiful and profound. I think it's a work of true art. It is a brave, brave piece of filmmaking on many levels, and it will stand the test of time.",The Passion of the Christ
381,Jack_Acid,So much potential squandered...,7,6 March 2004,"Man oh man....this film could have been so good, yet falls short in so many ways.  First of all, though not devoutly religious, I have no doubt that Christ existed and have read the Gospels.  Religion, especially in film, is so subjective, it's nearly impossible to classify it in any conventional sense.  This film is obviously driven by Mel Gibson's undeniable faith, and at times it shines brightly.  I give it high marks for intensity, but I wouldn't call it moving or spiritually enlightening.First of all, the good: the subtitles are an excellent device.  I thought it offered great authenticity to what could be defined as the single most revered day in history.  Technically, I thought the cinematography, visual effects and score were also excellent.  The roles of Jesus, Pilate and Mary were well done for the most part.  In fact, perhaps the most captivating part of the film was the relationship between Jesus and Mary, though even that was barely touched upon.  And again, the relationship between Pilate and his wife Claudia were better captured than the compassion for Christ.The bad:  Just about everything else.  In terms of a film, we expect an arc of story, or a plot.  This film offers none.  It's not a story, it's a sequence.  Had Gibson focused more on Christ and who He was and what He taught, this film would have packed way more of a punch.  It also might have sent a more profound message instead of what I took it as, which is sheer guilt.  The acting, especially on the parts of the Romans, seemed very forced and cartoon-ish.  The Jewish high priests were also one dimensional.  The bloodshed, though at first effective, quickly became the focus of the film instead of why we should care that it's happening.  I don't think that the bloodshed was unnecessary, but certainly excessive and over the top.  It's good to see the darkest aspects of what Christ endured, but there comes a point where all Gibson's doing is establishing that torment, over and over and over.  Nothing moves forward, it's just regurgitation.Gibson doesn't offer any reason for us to care what's happening.  I found myself relating to it strictly from a humanity standpoint, where I sympathized with Jesus only out of compassion for his physical endurance. But I felt the same for Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking, where he plays the part of a convicted rapist and murderer condemned to death.  Hmmm, what's wrong with this picture?As an example of misdirection, instead of making the March to Golgotha scene 15-20 minutes long (I'm estimating here), make it 3-5 minutes.  Use the rest of that time to COMPLETE the scenes of the Last Supper, or the Sermon on the Mount.  These snippet scenes, that consist no more than 15-20 seconds each, are the only link to who Christ was or allowed me to feel connected spiritually.  But the second I was compelled by that, it's back to the torture and bloodshed.  I'm sorry, but that's just HORRIBLE writing and directing.  Seriously.I think my biggest complaint is the message here, which is guilt, guilt, guilt.  Regardless of Gibson's intent, that's all that was conveyed as far as I'm concerned.  I interpret the teachings of Christ to be that of love, forgiveness and peace.  And though there are glimmers (and I mean glimmers) of those teachings in the film, they are too sparse to compensate for the bloodshed.  And though I am familiar with the Gospels and understood everything that was happening, from beginning to end, I still left scratching my head.  Bottom line, if you're not familiar with the story of Christ and His death, this is a very hollow film.  And to quickly touch base on all of the controversy this film has stirred, here's my two cents:  I don't think the film is anti-Semitic.  I didn't have a hard time with the gore or bloodshed.  I think it's pretty strange to read people's reviews that INSIST you take your kids to see this film, and it should be used as a teaching device, when really, it teaches NOTHING about who Christ was, or what He taught.I commend Gibson for his faith and vision to bring something to life that has affected his life in profound ways.  THAT is truly amazing, and in my opinion, the very essence of faith and what it can do to mend souls.  But in terms of a commercial film to be shown to the masses, there's really not a whole lot here.I wonder, would Christ Himself approve of this film's focus?  I highly doubt it.",The Passion of the Christ
382,Kazombie,Guilt trips u into believing,7,3 April 2004,"Some might say if more people saw the passion, they'd have faith in Jesus. I'd say it kinda guilt trips u into believing. Although, the movie is excellent in direction and acting and is very powerful with a very moving score.If you want to pay $9 to sit for 2 hours and watch a guy get tortured, well then its your choice. I'd say if we want to learn stuff like that, we should goto church, but the whole point of going to the movies is to be entertained and I myself, wasn't entertained.I think if the movie focused more on what Christ taught and what his miracles were, it'd be more insightful. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the dark ages and it ends up in really bad results. Lots of people got crucified in those days. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith. The truth is, there's not a whole lot about the crucifixion in the bible itself, it was actually done as a performance piece back in the middle ages to insight people against jews.Well, thats my personal opinion. but If you enjoy blood, gore and violence, this is a movie for you.",The Passion of the Christ

384,jhuni_x,Sickening and overly dramatic. GOD CANNOT FEEL PAIN!,1,19 July 2009,"It is sickening to see the crucification of Christ and they over-dramatize it, no human would have that much blood, especially someone as skinny and poorly-fed as Jesus. Throughout history many people were crucified such as 10,000 of Spartacus's soldiers. Why do they dramatize this particular person to such an extent? According to new testament canon this fictional Jesus character is considered to have all the powers of Yahweh as such he was omnipotent so he could have easily blocked out pain and he also being omniscient knew before hand that this was going to happen and that he would not die. He did not experience any fear, risk, death, or pain in this experience. Jesus did not sacrifice anything for these reasons.As such this whole movie is based upon a deception, a deception not only that this fictional story is true but also the deception that Jesus sacrificed something and that Jesus felt any pain at all. There is no way Jesus could have felt pain according to the same people who created this story. I have yet to here someone address the issue that Jesus did not feel pain in crucification, as such this whole entire story is based on a lie.",The Passion of the Christ

How come its ok for the jews to blame the Germans for the holocaust, but the minute the Jews are blamed for something, all of a sudden its anit-semitism? theyre quick enough to point the finger of blame at others, but when its pointed at them, theyre suddenly innocent. The Jews are just mad that the truth of the passion of the christ is coming out and they know they should be ashamed of what they did to Jesus!On another note this is quite possibly the MOST IMPORTANT FILM EVER MADE! The most emotional experience you'll have at the movies this year! Mel Gibson has delivered a bold, brilliant and compelling film. Its is such a MASTERPIECE that it simply can't be put into words. This movie will CHANGE THE WAY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE!",The Passion of the Christ

387,aliholly-62819,"Heart wrenching, visual stunner",8,22 April 2019,"This isn't Memoirs of a Geisha. The movie takes place in the desert and they all wear burlap sacks, with the exception of the Roman soldiers, so it was a difficult task to take a story and make it artful without the obvious visual stimuli of color. Yet, somehow, Mel Gibson turned this into a moving painting. In that respect, alone, it's an amazing film.
The story, wholly familiar to some, is pretty cut and dry. It's not difficult to understand what's going on, and can be very emotional, IF, again, you know the story. I feel what the story lacks is character development. You don't get to know who Jesus is before you watch him be brutally beaten and crucified. It would have been more impactful to the audience to get to know Jesus.
I think the movie that Mel Gibson was trying to make was for those that know who Jesus was and is, and is, to come. To comprehend what Jesus suffered and how brutal what He went through for us was. In that respect, Mel Gibson hit the nail on the head....literally.
For those that don't know, Jesus was the Son of God. He was sent down here, innocent and free of sin, to die so that we could believe, by faith, and have the chance at eternal life. That was The Passion of the Christ",The Passion of the Christ

Now, if you want the true religion that will save you in the afterlife, and the real story as to what actually happened to Jesus, READ THE QURAN!The Quran is the true, unchanged words of GOD. I don't care if you believe me or you think I'm trying to wash your brain or you think I'm delusional. But, do yourself a favor and think critically and objectively. Your whole believe (as a Christian) relies completely on The Bible, a book that in fact was -once upon a time- indeed the words of GOD but isn't now but a tampered-with book. While The Quran is nothing like that. Don't believe me? A simple google check suffice. Jesus wasn't the son of GOD. GOD has no children and is mightier for such a claim. But, Jesus was his prophet. Also, Jesus was never crucified, but people were made to have this thought. Anyway, read the Quran, read about Islam and prophet Muhammed. I'm out.",The Passion of the Christ
389,Hal_Opinot-Pepper,"Beautifully shot, otherwise completely vapid",6,18 February 2006,"I give it a 6 because it's so technically lovely. Other than that, there's nothing either good or bad to say about this film. It's telling that this movie generated a ton of *controversy* but no *debate*. That's because it doesn't say anything.I could comment about scripture, or Christian beliefs about the events surround the historical figure of Jesus, but having seen this movie I have no comment to make that I wouldn't have made before seeing it... it added nothing, it said nothing particularly new, it basically made no statement other than to re-tell a story that you probably had already made your mind up about. I have never seen a less thought-provoking movie.Yes, it's very graphically violent for a mainstream movie, and a lot of time is spent on torture sequences. I actually didn't find it gratuitous... I think Gibson is trying to present a horrific death in keeping with the horrific amount of human sin that his beliefs say that death was meant to compensate for... to those who subscribe to Christian beliefs, it's a serious story, and I got the impression he went to visual extremes not gratuitously but because he was trying to convey the full weight of it as a sacrifice (as he believes it to be.) That said, as entertainment goes, this does not hold a lot of weight as a movie. There's is nothing to make someone who is a newcomer to the story identify with the Jesus character. Everything is painted in broad dayglo strokes. When key narrative points happen, slow motion is often used to make sure you can't miss THIS HERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPORTANT! This often passes for some sort of dramatic tension. There's very little character development or anything that makes you care about the characters in the way most successful dramas make you care about the individuals story is being told.I didn't particularly pick up on outright antisemitism - I think what some people are considering antisemitism is just Gibson's inability to use any kind of subtlety. His characters come off like caricatures not because he's a bigot, but because he never bothers to flesh them out.Basically, beyond the technical polish, all this movie has is what the viewer brings to it in terms of his beliefs or prior knowledge of the story. There's nothing here to give you any perspective that you didn't already have.Oh, wait, I did forget one thing about it that I have a big problem with. The film is in Latin, Aramaic, and Hebrew with English subtitles. There is no English audio track available, you MUST read the subtitles for two hours. An audio track for the visually impaired is provided with English voice-overs but it also includes an annoying announcer-type voice that gives a ""play-by-play"" description of every single thing that is happening on screen. This is almost unlistenably annoying, and completely interferes with the enjoyment of the movie. It's like trying to watch the movie with an audio book of the story playing. Given that it was recorded and included on the DVD anyway, the English language overdubbed dialog could have been provided on an audio track by itself, so those of us who don't want to use subtitles could enjoy the movie without them. But this was not done, so unless you put up with an annoying ""play-by-play"" that you'd really have to be seriously vision-impaired to be willing to put up with, you must read the subtitles and listen to his precious ""historically authentic"" dialog. A case could be made for accuracy, but if he's going to go to this much trouble to get it accurate why did he then cast white actors to play middle easterners? He's got the entire cast speaking Aramaic, yet the actors playing Jesus and his followers look like they're from northern Europe! The insistence on using the original languages is not art, it's not historical accuracy, it's just artistic pretense and it's very irritating.",The Passion of the Christ

391,openeyes,A brutal but beautiful film,10,6 April 2004,"""The Passion of the Christ"" is one of those rare films, like Oliver Stone's ""JFK,"" were the reviews tend to reveal more about the reviewers than the film itself.   Many people seem to be praising or rejecting this film strictly in light of their personal prejudices concerning the person of Jesus.  I suppose that is unavoidable.  As a Christian, I generally found myself in agreement with Gibson's viewpoint, but I believe I could still look objectively at the film as a film -- religious beliefs notwithstanding.For example, yes, I hated Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" which I disagreed with theologically.  However, I had just as many theological problems with ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" but I enjoy that film immensely.  I have probably watched JCS many times more than I have watched Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" which is probably the best overall, and most theologically-sound, film about the life of Christ.  However, any of the films mentioned above are more interesting to watch than the high-minded but dour ""Greatest Story Ever Told"" which seemed to last longer than Christ's actual ministry on Earth.So how does ""The Passion of the Christ"" fit into the equation?  Is it successful?  Does it work as a film?  Objectively, I believe the answer must be yes.  Technically, the film is flawless.  ""The Passion"" was shot beautifully by Caleb Deschanel, one of the masters of the craft.  The sets and costumes were impressive.  The acting was uniformly professional, if not excellent.  (It is hard to truly evaluate performance in a foreign language.)  More importantly, the structure of film itself was simple and skillfully executed.  Granted, the film does have a limited scope, dealing only with the passion in light of the opening scriptural quote from Isaiah about how we would be healed by the Messiah's wounds.  The quote was essentially a thesis statement which Gibson rarely swerved from.  He wanted to show those wounds and he did so in great detail.  I believe Gibson was successful.  ""The Passion"" was a beautiful and moving, albeit brutal, film.Many complain the film doesn't spend enough time dealing with the teachings or life of Christ, and that, based strictly on the information shown in the film, one would have to wonder why Jesus' death was even worth showing. Good point, however, I think it'd be safe to say that pretty much everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation or lack thereof, knows at least some of the basic outline of the story.  How much background is really needed?  Plus, remember Gibson's thesis.  This film isn't about the teachings of Christ.  It's about the purpose of his incarnation: His sacrificial death.  The source material for the film, the Bible, makes it clear that Jesus' primary purpose wasn't to teach us how live better, but instead take away the sins of the world with his death.  In that light, I don't think it was outlandish to finally see a film dealing strictly with that subject.  People didn't complain that James Cameron spent too much time in ""Titanic"" showing the ship sink.  If anything, they complained Cameron waited too long before letting the ship to hit the iceberg.  I can understand that.  The story of the Titanic is pointless without the iceberg, just as the story of Jesus is pointless without the cross.But did it have to be so violent?  Probably not.  If I were Mel Gibson, I would have toned down the violence to get a PG-13 rating, and hence, a larger potential audience.  Sadly, for those offended by the violence, Mel didn't call and ask my opinion.  It's just as well he didn't!  Since the purpose of the film was to illustrate the suffering of Christ, toning down the violence would limit its effectiveness.  Still, despite its artistry, I would not recommend this film to children.Normally, I don't respond to previous reviews posted on this website, but there have been so many strange opinions that I can't resist making a few comments.  Despite all the controversy before the film's release, it seems only a very few people here actually found the film anti-semitic. However, I was amused by one reviewer who said Mel didn't have one good thing to say about a single Jew in the entire film.  Huh?  What about Jesus?  Wasn't Jesus a Jew?  Mel seemed to display some admiration for him.  Others complained that the film showed only hate, and not the positive qualities of Christianity like love.  Hmmm.  I think those reviewers might've missed the whole point of the film.  Wasn't it Jesus himself who said there was no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends?  The film had love.  Lots of it.I was also somewhat dismayed by the shoddy scholarship of some of the people discussing the historical accuracy of ""The Passion of the Christ."" Whether Jesus is the Son of God is indeed a matter of faith.  However, other aspects of the debate fall within the realm of fact.  There have been those here who claimed the gospels were written long after the events, and that they have been changed periodically by church officials over the centuries to suit their needs.  Both charges are nonsense.  Take, for example, the Magdalen Papyrus, a fragment of the gospel of Matthew, which has been dated to roughly A.D. 60.  That easily puts the gospel within the eyewitness range. Skeptics and believers alike generally agree that the last gospel to be written was the Gospel of John.  I have read some books which dated it as late as the third century, but that is a hard position to maintain when a fragment of the Gospel of John found in the Egyptian hinderlands, the John Ryland MS, was dated to A.D. 130.  Since it probably took some time for the Gospel to find itself in such a remote location, it is safe to assume the Gospel was written a number of years earlier.  As for the claim that the Gospels have been changed periodically over the years, I must ask you to present your evidence.  Give us the before and after passages.  Over five thousand Greek manuscripts have been found.  Granted, there is some variance, but the vast bulk of differences are as trivial as alternate spellings of words.  No manuscript has been found with any change which suggested the slightest revision of doctrine.  Reject Christ as Lord if you so desire, but don't tell me the Bible isn't textually reliable.  The book has stood the test of time.",The Passion of the Christ

393,MikeSmash,"""The Passion of the Christ"" is Gibson's masterpiece!!",9,17 April 2006,"""The Passion of the Christ"", Mel Gibson's historical account of Christ's crucifixion, is a modern day cinema masterpiece. Although thought by many as somewhat gruesome & anti-Semitic, ""The Passion"" paints an all to realistic account of the persecution & ultimate crucifixion of Jesus never before witnessed on the silver screen. The subject matter of Christ's last moments will always be sensitive in nature & fodder for the skeptical & Gibson's rendition does little to quiet the ongoing disputes & skepticism. ""The Passion"" is depicted in excellent slow-motion shots, recollections of events leading up to the crucifixion, native languages spoken with subtitles, & ultra-realistic imagery of Christ's brutal persecution & crucifixion. Gibson spared no viewer the absolute horror of the beatings & bloodshed Jesus endured, as well as the beauty of the His love towards his persecutors. Gibson captured Christ's final moments with his own religious & film-making passion & succeeded with capturing the viewer's heart & thoughts of faith and love.""The Passion of the Christ"" chronicles the last 12 horrific hours of Jesus of Nazareth. The story begins with Jesus praying just after the Last Supper. Jeshua is betrayed by Judas, a disciple of His, & is captured in the Garden of Olives by the Jewish militia. Judas was paid by the Jewish religious leaders to lead them to Jesus in order to arrest Him. Jesus had been teaching for years & spreading His word, healing the sick, & gaining followers who questioned the Jewish faith & saw Him as the Messiah. For His crimes, Jesus was long sought after to stand for His betrayal of lies. Jesus is bound in chains & brought back to Jerusalem to be judged. In the Jerusalem square, the Jewish religious leaders lobby for His persecution for crimes against the faith. As foretold, Peter denies his friendship with Jesus three times. Judas, racked with guilt, goes to the Jewish religious leaders to plead for Christ & return the 30 silver pieces given to him for his betrayal. Judas later hanged himself in grief over what he had done. Jesus was brought before the Roman governor Pontius Pilate to answer for His crimes. Pilate sees no reason to punish Jesus, who then sends Him to Galilean king Herod for final judgment. Herod, amused & disgusted, questions Him then sends Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate leaves Jesus' fate to the people & Jewish religious leaders to decide & it is flagellation to be carried out. Jesus is brought to a square where Roman soldiers prepare to punish Him. Mary, Mary Magdelan, & others watch in horror as Christ is struck numerous times by cane & cat-o'-nine tails, leaving His body with torn flesh & immense pain (hard to watch). After the savage beating, He is brought before Pilate & the angry mobs to be given His ultimate punishment, crucification. With His body battered & bloodied & a crown of thorns upon His head, Jesus carries his cross with assistance from Simon & is finally nailed to the cross where He prays for Man, who watch Him die on the cross. The film ends with Jesus resurrected from His tomb, walking into the world again. I have never witnessed such a brutal display of cruelty & brutality as seen in His persecution. Gibson spared us nothing & made us uncomfortable with his portrayal of the savagery & cruelty of the beatings, the agony expressed of His face & body, the severe pain He felt, & the bloodshed spilled. Mary, filled with emotional pain & suffering at having to witness her Beloved Son's demise, grabs the heart of all who see her. You cannot turn away your eyes; you are riveted by the performances & emotionally attached. James Caviezel is brilliant in his portrayal of Christ & should have been forever changed by His role. Maia Morgenstern is captivating as the Holy Virgin Mother Mary.""The Passion of the Christ"" will move you in many ways. The flashbacks used give subtle hints of the past & the looming Satan beckons Christ to abandon His faith & succumb to temptation. A film worth seeing if only to satisfy curiosity. This is not a film for children nor the faint of heart. The scenes of persecution are extremely graphic & will disturb some viewers. Brutal. Historic. Amazing.",The Passion of the Christ
394,Theoron,I'm not worthy...,10,25 February 2004,"Just saw ""The Passion"" a little over two hours ago.  In short, it was the most powerful film I've ever seen.  Nothing else even comes close.
Watching ""The Passion"" is like watching the stations of the cross come to life. (Catholics will understand...)  You get to see EXACTLY what Jesus went through during his last hours before death.It begins in the Garden of Gethsemane where we find Jesus praying that ""this chalice be taken away.""  We see Satan doing everything SHE can possibly do to prevent him from saying ""yes"" to the coming torture and crucifixion. Then the Temple guard, lead by one of Jesus' own disciples, comes to arrest Jesus, and take him before the Sanhedrin to be tried for various crimes, especially blasphemy.  And so the passion of Christ begins, and will only end when Jesus breaths his last breath while hanging on a Roman cross.  It is these last few hours of his life that the term ""passion"" has come to signify.  And what an interesting choice of words ""passion"" truly is...This movie goes beyond intellect, beyond cold, hard reason.  It is intentionally emotional and very spiritual.  You can only understand it and appreciate it on those levels.Is there a lot of violence?  Well yes, and it's all done to Jesus.  But the truly amazing thing is that he doesn't fight back.  He knew he had to go through with this terrible humiliation and death, and he never lifts a finger to prevent it.  That's what makes it seem more violent than what it really is...Jesus never fights back, nor do his followers.  We're not used to seeing that in a movie. (...or NOT seeing it...)""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Patriot,"" ""Kill Bill,"" and countless other films are all far more violent than this film.  What separates the violence in ""The Passion"" from your typical slasher or war movie is that in this film the violence is done to humiliate the victim, just as it really was intended back in Roman times.  The crucifixion and flogging were not some neat little punishment where a couple of drops of blood were shed.  The Romans had every intention of making flogging and crucifixion as bloody and painful as they possibly could, and the movie brings this FACT home in a very powerful way.The Bible is very clear that Jesus knew well in advance that all this was going to happen to him, and he does NOTHING to prevent it!  As a matter of fact, he almost seems to welcomes it!Is it anti-semitic?  No.  Jews are shown in both a positive and a negative light in this film.  Remember, Jesus and his followers were all Jews, and Jesus is the one who is the worst for it, especially after the Roman soldiers lay into him.  The Sanhedrin of that day certainly played a role in his death, but that was then...and they were only doing it because they thought Jesus was a blasphemer.  According to Jewish law, the penalty for blasphemy is death.  No doubt they had political motives in their decision to go after Jesus as well, but there were lots of regular folks, all Jews, who tried to show kindness to Jesus as they saw him suffer under the Roman whip.What I came away with after watching this film is a wonderful feeling of being unworthy.  Yes, a WONDERFUL feeling of being unworthy!  Why so? Because it is obvious that the real Jesus went through with all this pain and suffering because of his great love for us: all of us.  Even those who don't believe in him; even those who killed him.  There's simply no other explanation that makes any sense.  Why does God demonstrate his love for us in such a painful, humiliating fashion?  What caused Him to do this?  I think he wants us to realize that his love is more powerful than death, more intense than torture.  We can do what we like to God, but we can't stop him from loving us.I'm not worthy of that kind of love.  I don't want someone to go through torture and crucifixion to prove their love to me.  But then it wasn't my choice...it was his...I'm a better person for having seen this film.  What more can you ask of a movie?Rating: 10/10",The Passion of the Christ

It is also a relief to see Christ portrayed as a dark-haired, olive-skinned Jew.However, there are a number of clumsy film editing splices as well as continuity problems during the crucifixion scene (Jesus' arms are horizontal, then at an angle above his head).I am concerned that the power of this message may be overwhelming to the ignorant or underdeveloped mind and bring about intense zealotry in the form of attempts to 'avenge' Christ or retaliate against society; please remember everyone, if you disagree with someone's beliefs, pray for them, don't judge them.",The Passion of the Christ

Despite the very depressing, long and continuous flogging of Jesus at the hands of the Romans, there is a positive message here: BELIEVE.Jesus kept his faith until the very end and even forgave those who brutalized him. How he had such convictions is beyond me, but the power of those convictions is never to be questioned. I seriously doubt that anyone can walk away from this film and not be impacted in some way by what they have seen.

398,limesoda,An unbiased review,2,29 June 2004,"Ok lots of people have commented so I'm going to throw in my 2 cents. This movie was pretty boring. The creepy Satan was pretty cool. I have actually read 2 of the 4 (I think there was 4) versions of the Capture and crucifixion of Jesus in the New Testament, and the movie strayed from the text quite substantially. However I digress. I always think that when something is based on a Book that the movie should be able to be viewed separately, this was a problem I had with the first 2 Harry potters, my coz who read the books loved the films but I found them pretty uneven and kind of unsatisfying - this ties into the film because you see Jesus getting bashed and snuffed and it doesn't really let you into his message. I liked the scene where Mary talked to Jesus about the Table he was making it was a sweet scene and played very nicely. I'm not a religious guy I think there is something out there more great than we can possibly fathom, but until it's time to meet it face to face we should kick back and have some fun. If a person has faith I think it's great unless they're Zealots or only use the Bible to propagate hate and persecution. Ok I'm a little off track but back to the movie - Pretty boring movie - If you'd like to see a good movie about Jesus find a Mini Series called ""Jesus"" released about 3 years ago (I think) A better use of the source text.I'll end with what I think sums up the entire story of Jesus in one line as written by Douglas Adams in Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy. ...2000 thousand years after a man was nailed to tree for saying how great it would be if everybody was nice to each other.",The Passion of the Christ
399,asticht,Words cannot adequately describe this masterpiece,10,1 March 2004,"For those persons who have made the comment that Mel Gibson has committed career suicide by making this film, I think they are wrong.  This film is one of those films that one is reluctant to say that you enjoyed it.  This is a masterfully done recreation of the last 12 hours of Christ's life and while the movie is extremely uncomfortable and painful to watch it is very well done and it probably more accurately portrays the Passion of Christ better than any film that has ever tackled the subject matter previously. Let there be no mistake about it, this film is extremely violent and graphic in it's presentation.  But for today's audiences who crave realism and watch episodes of Law and Order and CSI, the very graphic representation of the humiliation and tortuous abuse inflicted on Jesus is important to the whole context of what Jesus went through for the rest of us who are Christians. This film left me in shock and I was exhausted and in virtual pain realizing how horrible people can be to one another, let alone that Jesus was during his time one of the most respected and at the same time hated personalities in civilization. For those who feel that this film will spark anti-semitism I think that you really need to reexamine the scriptures because the subject that is addressed about the Jews themselves hating Jesus is no secret and the things that he suffered not only at the hands of the Romans, but at the hands of his own people are accurate and are well documented in the bible. This information is nothing new and if someone decides to take out their anger against anyone living, they really need to take a breath and realize that what happened in this film took place over two thousand years ago. None of the people who commited these heinous crimes are living and should not be punished for the sins of those who lived back during the lifetime of Jesus. Mel Gibson is a genius who has an eye for cinematography and displayed a sense of pure mastery behind the camera.  He is as good of a director as any that currently are employed in Hollywood and I hope that he can continue to run a career where he is both behind and in front of the camera.  One scene in particular which I strongly suggest you to watch for is when Jesus actually dies on the cross, you see a tear from God descending from the heavens, and the camera is from the tears point of view as it travels earthward. This scene was pure cinematic magic and struck me as the work of absolute genius.  For those persons who have contemplated taking their children to the film, please don't, at least until they are at least in their teens as this film is bound to induce nightmares in the younger kids and this movie is not something that they are ready to experience.  I would sum up my rating of this film with one word, AWESOME.  At least for me it was a faith reaffirming experience and it is one that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.",The Passion of the Christ
400,nbwritersinbox,Stunning Cinema: But I'll Continue To Worry About Historical Accuracy,10,2 May 2013,"In the hands of Mel Gibson, The Crucifixion Story is retold with solid flare, historical detail and an outstanding caste. (The casting itself is superb for a modern, Hollywood movie). Convincing, believable performances are coaxed from nearly all the players. We can also feast our eyes on outstanding cinematography, while enjoying a compelling soundtrack. My big problems with exploring one of the most significant religious figures in history are these: How accurate can an account of Jesus' last painful twelve hours on Earth be? And - How much artistic license is being used instead of historically researched fact? Most historians and philosophers appear to agree, what Jesus said was profound (and sometimes difficult to interpret). If this film promotes a genuine study of the New Testament and it's deep meanings, then cinema has a point after all, rather than just for dramatic spectacle.Mel Gibson understands the language of cinema well, and how players interact within scenes to provide an audience with satisfying connections. That said, did the crowd really chant for Jesus' blood after he is condemned by a Jewish Court of Sanhedrin? Did the Roman Abenader really act with compassion, arguing directly against crucifixion of a man who had committed no recognizable offense under Roman Law? ""Abenader"" is, in fact, a name ascribed to an unknown centurion reporting to Pilate, the Fifth Prefect of Judaea assigned by Rome to that province. During Jesus' life, Judaea was an occupied territory, Pompey The Great having sacked the Temple Of Jerusalem some years earlier. Judeae was important to Rome due to trade routes through to Egypt, beyond that it had little benefit to the treasury.In most accounts, it is Pilate that orders Jesus' execution, manipulated by the Sanhedrin to a lesser or greater degree. Pilate was recalled to Rome due to harsh treatment against the local Jewish population of Judaea.Abenader arises from Anne Catherine Emmerich's visionary work: The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ (published in 1862). Anne Catherine was a devout German Catholic and stigmatic (someone displaying the same types of wounds as Christ Himself suffered). Although no expert in this field, stigmatics tend to be Catholic and tend to feel a deep and passionate connection with Jesus Christ. Many Catholic Saints displayed stigmata, these being recorded as early as 1200 AD (during the life of Francis Of Assisi). Anne Catherine herself was canonized (bestowed sainthood) by the Catholic Church.""The Passion"" itself is a cumulative suffering of Christ, ending with his crucifixion on Golgotha (according to The Catholic Encyclopedia).So, although I admire Mel Gibson's beautifully rendered account of The Passion, I will continue to worry that his screenplay was based on a visionary work of the 19th Century, not a detailed study of the Gospels. (The latter study, one must emphasize, amounting to a lifetime's work few scholars achieve easily).",The Passion of the Christ

As the movie progressed though, my enthusiasm just got eroded bit by bit and I really struggled to make it through to the end. The biggest let down is that the film showed very little of the gospel that Jesus preached and so for newcomers you really don't get a sense of what it's all about. There were a few lame flashbacks tacked on here and there but I imagine Jesus to have been a very passionate guy and there it is in the title. But what we get here is a kind of watered down version who in most scenes looks half stoned like he'd had a few hits on the crew's bong before each take. What we end up with is a crucifixion by numbers. A melodramatic, docudrama saturated with gratuitous violence and little else. Long, slow, drearily nihilistic and brutal scenes are played out with little hope or sense. This was a man of incredible faith and conviction supposedly enduring hell for us but the movie hardly gets that point across at all. Some of the acting wasn't bad though so I suppose we can give it a 3.",The Passion of the Christ
403,Flamio,Wow! The most thought provoking film of the year!,10,23 March 2004,"Those of you who have read my many reviews over the years know I am very critical, honest, and just don't comment on the obvious. Read on......This film is one of the best films I've seen in years. There's a reason this film has over 59% of the reviewers giving it a 10/10. The acting is great. The story is the best ever (read a Bible). Yes, it is very graphic, and it helped me realize how much Jesus suffered for my sins. I made the mistake of eating a large buttered popcorn through the scourging scene. If you have a weak stomach, not a good move. You know what made me realize how good this film was? It was the fact that after watching it I didn't even think of it as a film ALL in sub-titles.I remember all the actors speaking in English. Holy mackerel Batman!Amazing. Yes, maybe it wasn't 100% accurate. Yes, maybe Gibson's pre-vatican II, catholic church Mary worship junk came out, but all in all, it was great and pretty much in line with scripture. WARNING: This film is graphic, very graphic. DO NOT TAKE CHILDREN. Alright, about all the hype. You're not gonna leave the theater hating Jews. If anything, you'll hate Romans. Yes, in the beginning, the Jewish leaders were a bunch of self-righteous, holier than now snobs, and yes, it was easy to hate them, but common, this was 2,000 years ago. The roman guards, now those guys were scumbags! Some were cruel, mean, without feeling. Some were compassionate. It reminds me of the Nazi guards who befriended some of the Jews during the holocaust so they could live. Not everyone is bad. But, those Jewish Leaders that condemned an innocent man to death, and those brutal guards who laughed and mocked all the way through, oh ya, those dudes apart from repentance are frying good now, with various levels of pain for eternity. We get one chance on this Earth (did you hear that Shirley Mclaine!), make the most of it. SEE THIS FILM. FLAMIO, and I'm out.",The Passion of the Christ

There really is nothing else to make this film interesting to anyone, except of course that someone told you this was the ""real' story of Christ. It isn't...not at all.Thanks to Mr. Gibson and company, people can safely go into Blockbuster, and pull this off the shelves, and get the exact same experience you would if you rented any other bad slasher picture out there.There is no message of Christ in this film. There is simply some sick people getting off on being able to film a man being slowly beaten to death.",The Passion of the Christ

It details the suffering of Jesus Christ in detail - what he went through for all of us.  What happened was brutal and violent - and for that the film does deserve its R rating.  It is not a film meant for younger children.  From what I remember of reading through the Bible, the story does follow what came down from the gospels pretty accuratly.  Also the use of Latin and Aramaic, along with the buildings and props used gave the film a sense of realism.  Plus everyone who starred in the film did an excellent job in making the Passion have such an emotional impact.  I think that for adults and older teenagers, it's definetly a film to see.",The Passion of the Christ
406,carlabrams,Very graphic and appropriate,10,23 October 2004,"We did not see this movie in the theaters - we just got up from the DVD on our home theatre, which was striking enough.First, this is quite a graphic movie. In an era where zombies eat brains and it's shown in full cinematic gore, the realistic showing of the lash and the cat o'nine tails ripping into the flesh of Jesus (James Caveziel) was well done. Why does this strike people so much? Because, whether you're religious or not, you've heard of this description, with Jesus getting lashed and then crucified.That's one thing that this movie does more so than any passion play that a church could do - it immerses you into the last days of Christ. Whether this is Mel Gibson's Catholic interpretation or not is irrelevant. No matter what else you may think of Him, Jesus was special. If you're religious, then you can believe that He died for your sins. If you're not religious, you still have to admit that He was a powerful spirit and a powerful man - especially given the time when these events occurred. There was no internet - no television - no radio. Just one man carrying a message of peace and love throughout a region to an oppressed people.What was done to Him is shown quite well. There were very few technical errors in the whole film - a couple of missed CG shots on the eyes. Mel Gibson wanted to do this film without the sub-titles. It could have stood alone without them. The performances by all the actors were stunning - and Maia Morgenstern deserves an Academy Award for her performance as Mary.Veritas - truth - this will go down in history as a movie that will be played again and again as an affirmation of faith.",The Passion of the Christ
407,abdelgulabkhan,"A Masterpiece, Shot beautifully and Grips You All The Way",10,27 February 2009,"This film is simply fantastic. Mel Gibson has done a great job. The language is hebrew and really gives the film a middle eastern environment and setting which is authentic. The story is really accurate to the bible and the all the actors are great. It shows how evil man can be, and how Jesus takes everything that is thrown at him and still carries on. Its a very interesting story as it also has the devil appearing in scenes all through the movie saying the burden is too much for any man to bear. Jesus continues the immense suffering and torture and the devil is wanting him to give up and die. The film has so many different levels of understanding in Christianity, and is really educational too. Its also inspirational in many ways. He heals the soldiers ear that is bleeding. He draws a line in the ground in his hand when the people are throwing stones at the harlot. Overall a film with depth and quality. I would say the best film ever. Nothing can match the atmosphere it should have got lots of Oscars, but there are so many people who do not believe in Jesus and just regarded the film as too horific because they do not open their minds to the bigger picture and the truth.",The Passion of the Christ
408,SelvarajanK,Man's love towards Mankind,10,29 November 2005,"This film tells the story of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus (Caviezel), on the day of his crucifixion in Jerusalem. This film's script is based upon several sources, including the diaries of St. Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774-1824) as collected in the book, ""The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ"", ""The Mystical City of God"" by St. Mary of Agreda, and the New Testament books of John, Luke, Mark and Matthew.Beautifully narrated by the multi-talented Mel Gibson (director) this is a must see film. The film moves really slow from the opening frame, but its that what makes the movie heavy in the end. Did Gibson had a blood bank near by when he shot the film? well, i thought there was too much of blood shed that some times it makes you close your eyes but the impact pours right through the veins of your heart.I really thought what difference can Mel Gibson can do with story, but at the end you have to give a standing ovation to Mel. I really liked the climax where a drop of water falls from heaven, which depicts the tear of the father of the Lord Jesus was really amazing and heard pounding.The film stands apart from Christianity, it's about one mans love towards his own mankind.",The Passion of the Christ
409,fwgrhouse,Greatest Movie Ever,10,30 April 2006,"I went to this film with my dad and when I left, I was speechless. Gibson really out did himself on this movie and I congratulate him on it. He really did an excellent job in showing all of us what Jesus went through to pay for our sins. It is also accurate about the events that lead up to the death of Jesus from the Last supper, to the death and resurrection I was also really surprised that the devil was actually included in the cast and it even showed a brief glimpse of hell. I was actually really surprised that The Passion didn't win any academy awards. I would recommend this movie for anyone but parents should think twice before letting their kids see it because of the graphic violence.",The Passion of the Christ
410,Ironboundfw,The Passion for the Slow Mo.,1,7 March 2004,"All right, was it as anti-semetic as we were led to believe. Not really. Facing the fact that Jesus was Jewish, and the story takes place in the land of the Jews, it is to be expected that both good guys and bad guys are jewish, except for those PESKY ROMANS.  Those Romans, have always been violent.  I mean, we go from Jesus's Death to Tony Soprano, and we learn one thing... Roman's like their pizza good and their deaths bloody.  (so what is Mel Gibson trying to say?)
Was it a good movie?  Heavens NO!  Mr. Gibson has not brought anything new to the art of film making, and the movie itself is a 2 hour lynching, wich, is more like a very violent S&M video.  You don't know if you're feeling bad for Jesus, or feeling admiration for the hunky actor playing him.  Let's just face it, this is the first Jesus in film history that is right down sexy.  Even as he is being mutilated, there is something about Cavizel that just fills the screen with sexual charisma.But Mel, oh Mel, those slow motion shots added a good hour to the movie. and they were silly.  Oh, yes, I know he died for our sins, but I can't believe he would die to have a movie so tackily made about him.  don't you think that it would have shown Jesus more love to abstain yourself from the self indulgent slow motion shots? I DARE SAY, after this movie, I want the slow motion shot retired and any director who ever dares to use it ever again, well he should be, well darn it, he should be... crucified.",The Passion of the Christ
411,newkfl,And Justice For All...,9,9 August 2008,"I really thought this was the best film that Mel Gibson had ever directed. Gibson captured the raw nature of man, the deceit of man, the passion of man and how when the chips were down, how man could be accepted or rejected. Some of the scenes were really graphic, but necessary to tell the true story of The Passion Of The Christ. Christ was a very loving man, but this love posed a threat to the king and some of the other rulers of the country. Christ could not be broken and took his true belief to the cross with him. At the time of death, sins were forgiven and the kingdom of heaven would be at hand. Christ could not be kept down. Mel Gibson was at his best and you should not miss this great film work.",The Passion of the Christ

In times of hate and violence the greatest leader preaches love & tolerance. I believe that's the only interpretation. The fundamental message of all religions.....

413,cdimdb,Mad Mel lets us into his world,1,5 January 2006,"Other commentators have described the appalling tolchocking and lashings of ultraviolence, so there's no need for me to go over it again. I'm more interested in the mentality of the man who made this high-budget sequel to 'The Life of Brian'.We hear that Mad Mel is deeply devout. That he belongs to a highly uncompromising sect who brook no deviance from the official texts. Which presumably means that everything shown in the film is note-perfect as far as Mel and his clonies read it. I assume that he, and they, all consider this particular segment of the Jesus story to be the most important part - the bit that most needs retelling in perfect realism.So what on earth is wrong with these people? Admittedly the documentation on most of JC's reported 33 years is sketchy, but there are a number of highlights with cute story lines that they could have used. It might have been interesting to see, in a super-realistic setting, the impact of some of the famous miracles on those present.(Or they could even have bitten the bullet, and shown that these magic events were actually just the result of hysterical re-telling of ordinary events: walking on water=wading out on a sandbar. After all, JC's central, important message was 'love your neighbour', with no codicil about '...and you'll be able to do magic.' The 'miracles' may have helped to sway the crowd, but either you believe that JC was divine or you don't. In either case, tricks that David Blaine could easily ace are pretty irrelevant.) Instead, Mel chose to show the part of the story where JC is tortured and murdered. Why is that important? Well, it's the blood sacrifice demanded, bizarrely, for the 'redemption of Original Sin'. Pretty gory and OT, but that's the way it's supposed to work, apparently. Was this point put across? Don't think so. In fact there seemed to be two messages in this film: a) humans are horrible; b) JC suffered terribly. Are these important or central to Xianity? News to me, if so.I spent two weeks in Intensive Care, contorted in horrible agony. Did that help the side out at all? We have horrible people today, in great number, causing unspeakable suffering to zillions. So not much change there. And what's the point?In all, I don't see how this film advances the cause of Mel's 'religion', unless they're really into pain and gore to the exclusion of the rest of the story. What's really alarming to me is the degree to which other Christians, who were hopefully less fixated on this part before, now have such realistic illustrative imagery left in their heads that they can hardly think of anything else.CD",The Passion of the Christ
414,kenday1,Extraordinary Film!,10,27 February 2004,"After just seeing this movie a few hours ago I still struggle to express all that I am feeling.  When the film was over there was such silence in the theater.  You could still hear people crying.  It was quite an experience! I have never been one to go see very violent movies but I knew I had to see this one.  I think if you go in knowing that the film will be brutally violent then you can prepare yourself to withstand it...I did! 
It's hard to comprehend that the Romans were so barbaric, but they were. Remember in history of how some of the Christians were thrown into the lions den?  What an awful sight that would have been to witness as well as the crucifixions!As a Christian, it is important that we all know what Jesus really went through and this film portrays that in raw reality!  Jesus the Christ took upon Himself the pain and agony FOR US!  He took our punishment for us!  He paid the price with his blood!I think the film would have been even more wonderful if the resurrection had been portrayed in more detail.  It was too brief.  Jesus rose from the dead! His physical resurrected body, nail-prints and all!  We could have seen the joy on Mary's face as she sees her son alive again!God bless Mel Gibson, James Caviezel and all the others who had a role in making this film!  This is a masterpiece!

415,RDenial,An important film,10,5 April 2004,"Reading the positive and negative reviews here reminded me of the crowd scenes in the Passion where some people yelled out curses at Jesus and some showed love and sympathy. This is a very violent and brutal film that was not easy to watch. I personally kind of think that part of the reason Mel Gibson made the first film on Jesus that focuses almost exclusively on His suffering is to appeal to the small minds who think Tarantino films are ""deep"". You know the type. Ask them their favorite films and they will list Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Memento, American History X and Se7en. So predictable.This is an important film. There is nothing more that I can add to previous comments except that if you go looking for something to like or dislike in the film, you will probably find it. If you go looking for anti-semitism, you will probably find it whether it is there or not. I do not think that it is ""there"".

The movie begins with clearly showing he is God and will not succumb to Satan but, banish him. Then we see him as a man who is betrayed and the complete and utter human sacrifice he knows he has to go through, is utterly terrified to go through it but, as God does it. The duality of this cant be explained to us and that is what faith is. This is just to witness what happened not to explain how and why like the bad reviews for this say.

418,runner-15,Some Thoughts,10,1 March 2004,"Most of the reviews of this movie are sharply divided between great and terrible, with few opinions falling in the middle ground. I am no different; I think it is one of the greatest spectacles in the history of cinema.Instead of simply reviewing the movie as many others have done more eloquently then I could ever hope to do. I will instead attempt to address a few specific issues that many people are pointing out again and again.First and foremost of course is the charge that the movie is anti-Semitic. The Idea that this movie by any stretch of the imagination could be considered anti-Semitic goes so far beyond ridiculous as to be ludicrous. I cannot even find the adjectives in my vocabulary to explain my disdain for this accusation.  A few words that do come to mind are; preposterous, absurd and yes even stupid. As Mr. Gibson himself has pointed out, there were only two groups of people present at the events portrayed in this movie, Jews and Romans. What Did you expect Mr. Gibson to use Russians and Aborigines? It was plain that not all of the Jews or Romans wanted Jesus to suffer, just as it was plain that some on each side did. If anything the Romans were depicted as the blood-thirsty savages, the Jewish leaders were simply following their own rules. Blasphemy was a crime under Jewish law and they were blind to the truth of Jesus being the Son of God. So when Jesus uttered the phrase, ` I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.' they were bound by Jewish law to condemn him to death. The greatest crime committed under Jewish law as applied to this case was the fact that they conducted an Illegal trial at night. There are other aspects of the capture and trial of Jesus that were questionable but this is not a forum for debating points of ancient Jewish law. People that find this movie anti-Semitic need to look deep into their own psyche, as they must have issues with hate and anger that need resolving. Instead of hate and anger toward any one person or group of people depicted in this movie I felt pity and sadness for them. They were only fulfilling a destiny that had to be fulfilled. As Jesus himself said `Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.'Some have made the statement that the movie is not true to the scriptures or left out important details or added others. Two thoughts come to mind. First this is a movie and a movie will never satisfy all of the preconceived ideas and opinions that have formed in peoples minds of a well-known topic, especially a topic as well-known and deep seated as this one. Second, although there was obviously some dramatic license taken in the making of this movie, I could find NOTHING that was counter to the accounts given in the four Gospels. There were things shown that are not mentioned in the Gospels but just because something isn't mentioned we don't know that it didn't happen. It quite obvious to anyone who has read the Biblical accounts of the events portrayed in this movie that not even the authors of the four Gospels saw things in exactly the same light. There are events in some that are not in others, and words spoke in some that are not in others. It is as the saying goes `A matter of perspective'.  This is Mr. Gibson's perspective on Christ's suffering.Others have said the movie was nothing but a gore-fest with little or no attention paid to the events that precipitated the events portrayed in this movie, or what happened next. Did you read the title?  The movie is titled `The Passion of the Christ'. The word PASSION when taken in its ordinal meaning and when applied to the crucifixion, means something completely different that what it means today. Today we equate the word passion with lust and desire, but its original meaning was suffering. So to make it a little simpler for those who don't understand you could re-title the movie `The Suffering of the Christ' and then it might make this a little clearer. The movie did not attempt to show the entire life of Christ or even the events after his resurrection. That has been done many times before, and who on this planet does not at least have a small concept of the story of Jesus Christ. This movie was about his suffering, the day that defined his love for mankind. That is why PASSION means suffering; he loved us all so much with such a pure PASSION that he willingly endured this SUFFERING for the salvation of mankind. This is even more amazing that if as a believer you consider that at any moment he could have called on God to stop the suffering and God would have done so. Jesus himself said that if he wanted God would send more than twelve legions of angels to save him. Even if you are a none-believer you must realize that when brought for trial before the Jewish elders he could have denied being a prophet and escaped the torment that was sure to come. But without his sacrifice there would have been no hope for mankind. Although I am not a Catholic, I am a believer and I believe God is reaching out to mankind in any way he can in today's world. All God is looking for is a `Willing Vessel' to do his work and he has found one in Mel Gibson.  Kudos to you Mr. Gibson for following you heart and producing a thought provoking film that is speaking to the hearts of many people. I myself have seen people who have not darkened a church for many years return after seeing this film.",The Passion of the Christ
419,mcmickymick,wailing on J.C.,3,27 August 2005,"Not exactly the feel good movie of the year. After watching Jesus get the h*ll beat out of him for about two hours I kind of felt numb. I'm not sure why people keep saying they were profoundly moved by this picture. I left thinking ""Boy, Jesus sure can take a beating."" After a while the whole thing just felt sadistic. Like one comment I read said- It was like watching a snuff film. Too much graphic violence for my taste. Got the point LONG before the close- ups of Big Js hands being nailed to the cross. Mr. Gibson-can I call you Mel?- You need to lighten up a little. After all, Jesus did make a great comeback only three days later. Maybe you're saving that for part II. Still, I gotta say I like the movie better than the book. Can't wait for the sequel.....",The Passion of the Christ
420,sylvesterthekat,Somewhat over-done but good performances,5,29 March 2004,"I suppose I ought to clarify firstly my religious leanings. I don't have any. I can't say I'm agnostic, maybe atheist but definitely not Catholic, Christian, Jew, Muslim or any other official or unofficial religion. I went to this movie with my husband who wanted to see it for some reason. I would have waited for the DVD. So bearing all this in mind I am judging the film as a movie and for its credibility rather than emotionally or with any leanings for or against any religion.Firstly, I was surprised at the lack of story. I don't call 90 minutes of torture and walking from point A to point B to be a story. There was very little of Christ's life, simply snippets in the form of flashbacks as he encounters people along his tortuous journey which trigger memories in his or their minds. It assumed sufficient knowledge of the scriptures as nothing was explained. Evidently I was sufficiently indoctrinated as a child that I was not left wondering what the various references and flashbacks were about.Secondly, I found the beating to be unrealistically harsh (not that I think the Romans or any other power group are/were incapable of doing such things but that a man could not survive them). I'd be interested to know what a doctor would have to say about the likelihood of a mere mortal being able to withstand so much blood loss, so much trauma to the skin and then somehow carry what appeared to be a tremendously heavy crucifix for 45+ minutes uphill. I'd challenge a healthy, strong man who had not been beaten to within (or beyond) an inch of life/death to be able to carry such a crucifix. This improbability spoiled the film for me because it is supposedly a true story and therefore Gibson had a duty to portray things realistically or else make it clear that Man has a heck of a lot of sins to be atoned for and therefore the beating was symbolic of that, rather than a true portrayal of events.It was drawn out for emotional reaction, I am absolutely certain of this. It may or may not have been done in order to attract controversy and therefore attention/box office $$. The acting was good by most of the players, especially the Roman boss guy who had to make the decision about Jesus' fate. It's a shame that more was not made of the Satan character, this was an interesting and intriguing storyline/character.So if you're wondering whether to see it... if you're looking for a good movie then don't bother until it comes out on DVD. If you're a Christian/Catholic and want to bathe yourself in emotion and the glory of Christ then go see it. Be warned though you'll do a lot of crying. If you're Jewish I'd caution against seeing it as the Pharisees are painted in rather a poor light and little explanation is given for their sudden hatred (are they really so insecure that a man calling himself the son of god is a threat? today we'd think he was a crank). If you're squeamish in the least then you'll spend so much time with your hands in front of your face that you'll have wasted your money. If you're a scholar of religion I'd recommend seeing it out of interest at how religious groups view each other and how someone such as Mel Gibson uses his position to put his personal views across (who knew he was so devout?). If you enjoy watching people suffer and wish you were wielding the cat o nine tails then you'll enjoy the movie but I caution that maybe you ought to enter some sort of counselling program as you may be a psycho.",The Passion of the Christ
421,Justin Harris,Just about what you'd expect...,6,28 February 2004,"Nothing spectacular about the film itself as we've heard this all before. Great performances and cinematography though. I'm not to much of a fan of reading movies, but the performances were so captivating that I didn't even notice it. A lot of people are trying to convince me that this is a super awesome movie (obviously because of the content involved). And I guess a lot of people are rating this film with a perfect score without taking into the context of what really makes a movie a movie compared to what makes a story a story. The story is well known and quite a depressing one too. People were literally leaving the theatre mid-movie crying. The story is good and so is the film, but by no means perfect as it's been done before. It's really just another story about Jesus Christ that's been overhyped for no apparent reason.Kind of a spoiler: My only real complaint with the movie was the ending where they showed Jesus resurrected with the holes in his hand. It's quite effective for the entire resurrection story, but I felt when they had Mary staring at the audience (breaking the fourth wall), it was far more dramatic and a better way to end the film.Score: 6 out of 10 (okay)",The Passion of the Christ

They were Lucky it was not rocks.,The Passion of the Christ
423,smitheeallen,Intense and Powerful Work of Art,9,29 February 2004,"Well, I saw it and it's intense and powerful.  I'll be honest, I am apracticing Catholic, so I buy into the belief that Jesus is the Saviorof the World, Died for my sins, is God Incarnate, etc.  It is abeautifully made film.  Some of the stuff with Satan does not work. There are some historical inaccuracies but the film is a work  of artand not a documentary.  Jim Caviezel who I loved in ""The Thin RedLine"" (which is my favorite film of all time) made a great Jesus.  Heis probably my favorite Jesus on film, though I loved Robert Powellin ""Jesus of Nazareth"" (it's been so long since I've seen ""TheGreatest Story Ever Told"" that I can't remember what Max VonSydow's performance was like but I'm sure it was good).  Is thiswhat Jesus really went through? Probably close to it.  From aCatholic point of view I like how the film showed that Grace existsin a sinful and brutal world.  I think the brutality was appropriate forthe film (though I would not show it to little kids).  I think it is goodfor people to know what Jesus went through no matter what theybelieve about him.  If he had not gone through what he wentthrough then there would be no Christianity.  Some people wouldsay that is good, but there would have been no Francis of Assisi,Mother Teresa, Martin Luther King, Jr., Dietrich Bonhoffner, JohnXXIII, or Oscar Romero.  These people are all lights that shine indarkness in which the darkness will never put out.  (That's fromJohn Chapter 1).  There would also be no great works of art likeMichaelangelo's Sistine Chapel or some of the world's greatestmusic the like Ave Maria (though that is about Jesus' mother) orAmazing Grace.       Probably the strongest point of the film is that it shows thatJesus was a real person with a real personality.  The flashbackscenes work really well.  I would not have minded a few moreflashbacks actually.  It showed that he loved everyone even thoughthere was a lot of hatred for him. As for anti-Semitism, I did not think it was.  The Romans werethe real brutes.  Caiphas and the other Temple priests were notshown in a positive but they were not in the Gospels either.  Therewere Jews in the priesthood that did not like the way Jesus wasbeing treated and the same with the crowd some were bloodthirstyand some were against it.  One must remember that most peopleliving at that time were ignorant and illiterate.  The priests toldthem what to do.  It would have been easy for Caiphas to entice thecrowds (assuming that is what really happened).  Also there isone scene where one of the Roman guards mocks Simon ofCyrene because he's a Jew. The other thing that was really good is that it felt as though itwere real.  It showed to the chaos of the whole Passion, basically. Except for a few hoaky scenes involving Satan, the film is superb. 9/10.",The Passion of the Christ
424,stamp1,"Very Moving, Very Bloody, Made Me Cry, Definitely NOT for Kids",10,27 February 2004,"I found the movie moving, many people were sniffling and wiping their eyes watching it, just like I did. I felt very sorry for Jesus and what he had to go through. I was ashamed that there are so many evil and wicked people in the world who could do such evil deeds. The Romans in the film just ENJOYED their torturing WAY TOO MUCH!!!! THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WERE TRULY EVIL AND WICKED! (If you are one of those naive people who think everyone is wonderful and there is no evil in the world, THEN MAYBE THIS MOVIE WILL OPEN YOUR EYES!!)The movie definitely should have been rated R. It is very violent and bloody!! (And this is an Understatement!!) The Flailing/Whipping scene made me cry. NO CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN SHOULD SEE THIS FILM IN MY OPINION! In the audience I was in, there were children (not a large number thank goodness!), and I was appalled that parents would bring 6 and 7 and 8 yrs. old kids to see this blood and carnage. I think those parents should be arrested for Child Abuse!!!!There was no profanity or sex in the movie. I thought it seemed extremely accurate, except for Satan appearing every so often. Except for that, it looked like a very good documentary film to me. I felt like I was really there in Jerusalem in 30AD for that Passover week and the Cruxificion!! Satan was played by a woman, and she was AN EXTREMELY GOOD ACTRESS!!! She really made me scared and nervous everytime Satan was shown on the screen!! And the little demons were HORRIFYING! I definitely got the symbolism of the Anti-Virgin Mary & child when Satan was there at the scourging of Jesus holding his little demon child. If Satan had been in the film more, then this would have been one of the scariest movies ever!Historical errors: No Greek on the sign on the Cross proclaiming Jesus the King of the Jews. No Greek being spoken at all. The Latin speakers and the Aramaic speakers could not understand each other back then. They spoke Greek as their second languages, to talk to each other. This is why the Gospels (and the entire New Testament) were written in Greek. NOT LATIN OR ARAMAIC OR HEBREW. (Like English is spoken today as a second language around much of the world, allowing people in the US, and India, and Vietnam, and Germany, and Israel, and Saudi Arabia, and Russia, to all be able to communicate with one another.)The audience I was sitting with mostly clapped and cheered when the film ended, just like with ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Lord Of The Rings 3"". I would strongly recommend people see this film, BUT, take tissues to wipe your eyes, and be aware IT WILL BE VERY INTENSE TO WATCH!! If you are a Christian, then you will be MORE AWARE THAN EVER of the sacrifice Jesus made when he willingly went to his death. If you are not a Christian, then maybe you will better understand why Christians celebrate Palm Sunday and Easter and The Resurrection. And wear crosses and have paintings and churches with crosses in them.",The Passion of the Christ
425,electrictroy,Watch Jesus of Nazareth first - this movie second,10,25 September 2005,"""The Passion"" won't make any sense without knowledge of the story. All you see is a man getting tortured, because Mel Gibson fails to develop his character. Which is the great flaw of this movie... it requires a fore-knowledge of the story. Without that knowledge, it falls flat.So instead I recommend you watch Jesus of Nazareth first. This is a 6-hour TV miniseries, available on DVD or the History Channel, which very, very powerfully portrays the life of Jesus - his birth, his years of preaching, the torture, and the resurrection.Then, knowing the story, you can watch The Passion. That way you'll feel you're watching a MAN on the screen, and not just an image. And most importantly, you'll feel the passion/suffering that Jesus experienced.",The Passion of the Christ
426,JimS_8686,"""Triumph Of The Will"" for the 21st century.",1,14 February 2010,"The success of the Passion Of The Christ serves as a reminder to a very unfortunate time in American society. An era where a post-9/11 America applauded a leader who said he ""sought a higher father"" to start a war in a country that had nothing to do with 9/11. Thanks to Mel Gibson, the dark underbelly of the religious fundamentalist movement has been exposed. This is a disgusting and nihilistic piece of garbage. The purpose of POTC is to provoke anti-semitic hatred and provide masturbatory material for religious fundamentalist wackos who insist the events depicted in this film ""actually happened"". This film inspired a movement of dangerous lunatics who broke into the hospice of Terri Schiavo and attacked nurses working there one year after the film's release. Hollywood will never put out a more sickeningly gory R-rated film, because it is not possible. Spatter films are of course a genre which has an audience. POTC is a splatter film hiding behind a religious agenda. How people could enjoy watching this crap is beyond me. POTC may have made a mint at the box office, but the film's goal of turning society into a bunch of psychotic fundamentalist freaks was dealt a crushing setback with the death of Schiavo. People like Gibson and George W. Bush who use religion as a blunt instrument with their attempts to divide and conquer are scumbags who are completely devoid of any worth to society. Jesus would be ashamed.",The Passion of the Christ
427,delbomber,It is accomplished,10,27 February 2004,"Brutal. Savage. Gory. Disturbing. Horrifying. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is all of these things.Moving. Haunting. Powerful. Mesmerizing. Unforgettable. It is also these.What it CERTAINLY is NOT: anti-Semitic. But I'll get to that...I was raised Catholic, but have very few ties with the Catholic Church today. I eat meat on Fridays, live in sin, and do lots of other things frowned upon by the Pope and the Church. While there is certainly much more to Christ than Catholicism, I added this qualifier for those who are quick to label anyone broaching the subject of religion a ""fanatic"".Few have endured hell-on-earth as Jesus did, as portrayed in this film. The last twelve hours of his life consisted of being betrayed, abandoned, tortured, and martyred. Was he as savagely beaten as Mel Gibson portrays? It doesn't really matter. What matters is that, for the first time in memory something attempts to convey, in all its rawness, the monumental sacrifice Jesus made for mankind. Regardless of his legitimacy as the messiah--even if he was just a kook--this man endured more pain, suffering, and humiliation than I ever realized or cared to imagine. This doesn't strengthen the love I have for Jesus, it makes me appreciate it that much more. Until today, no film has explored the physical sacrifice in such depth, and as a result this appreciation has long been missing, not just by myself, but by most Catholics and Christians I have known throughout my life.Viewers of this film will generally fall into two groups: those who believe in and love Jesus and those who do not. The first group will be horrified and moved by seeing their Messiah in such a blunt, prone, conquered state. To see the baseless contempt for and malice perpetrated upon Jesus, presented in such gory fashion, will leave most aghast, and some nauseous, but it will surely impart a visceral reaction of awe and wonderment for Christ to which few other sources have been able. The images projected in front of our eyes are so rattling that, perhaps for the first time, Christ is relatable, and accordingly extraordinary.Members of the second group, who are not watching their God being tortured as almost no human should ever deserve, will not be touched on this level, and will be more likely to complain of the violence. They may gain and understand an appreciation for Christ's devotion, but their lasting image of this film will be one of excessive violence and gratuitous gore. This won't even be so much of a conscious decision as an practical reality. They have no stake in this, and simply will be unable to interpret or digest in quite the same way what the anguish symbolizes for the first group. Without an existing compassion and deference for Jesus, few will have any feelings or ideas to be enhanced, and the film will be remembered for the excessive violence it certainly contains.Members of this second group are also much more likely to perceive an anti-Semitic message. Mel Gibson repeatedly focuses on the insistence by the Jewish high priests that Jesus be punished. Again, without a base of love upon which to build, these viewers will, in addition to the visual onslaught, focus on a plot that does not hide who is ultimately responsible for Christ's torture and execution... ...but to say the film has gone out of its way to blame all Jews for the death of Jesus is absurd, and a monumental leap. Not only are there dissenters within the group that condemn Jesus, there is not one single reference to the faith of that group. One man in particular, rather than canyons and canyons of Jews, is shown as the driving force behind Jesus' fulfillment of his fate. Additionally, it's the Romans who are portrayed as sadistic goons in their scenes of wanton cruelty, and the mob of Jews calling for crucifixion are no different than the mobs shown in any other historical Jesus picture. (Without the hoopla and hubbub surrounding this film, very few would even consider that the group is Jewish. But then, our media is one that thrives on controversy and perpetuating prejudice, so why should anyone be surprised?) What is key to note is that the characters in this film act in accordance with self-interest, not faith or religion.
And I ask, what would detractors have Gibson do? Historical texts tell us Jewish priests prompted the death of Jesus, so how can the story be told otherwise? Should aliens have been substituted for the typically power-hungry, religious officials? Perhaps Russians. They were demonized in films for the last fifty years, why not rewrite history for the sake of over-sensitivity for just one more picture?We do not blame all Germans for the Holocaust, and we do not blame all Americans, most descendents of Europeans, for the slaughter of Native Americans. Why, then, is there this idea that people will suddenly begin organizing lynch mobs to punish all Jews for the nearly 2000-year-old crime of only a handful?I'm certainly not going to change anyone's opinions. People will see what they want to see, and read into this film whatever they wish. This is not what this film is about, and those focusing on such a contrived detail, no matter their personal beliefs involving Jesus, are depriving themselves of an unforgettable experience. Good or bad, but certainly unforgettable.One last note--I can't help but be baffled by critics' reactions to this film. It has widely been panned for its overt and `exorbitant' violence. The website `Rotten Tomatoes' indicates 58 positive reviews to 55 negative. A quick check of reactions to `Kill Bill Vol.1' shows 159 positive reviews to only 32 negative. The only logical conclusion to be drawn from this is that violence, no matter how graphic so long as it is `stylized', is accepted with impunity, while true human suffering is intolerable and repugnant. Didn't 9/11 teach us we're not living in a dream world, or I am one of the few who has not forgotten?I'm a believer, and that's what I took away. In the end, each of us will have a unique reaction, and it would be foolish to allow the rhetoric of others to influence that.Beyond the gruesome brutality, I found this film to be beautiful. It is the first time someone or something has conveyed to me the true awesomeness of Christ's sacrifice. Some will agree, others will be disgusted, but few will walk away unmoved.",The Passion of the Christ
428,FilmLover-4,For LDS viewers,9,6 March 2004,"My wife and I decided to go see ""The Passion of the Christ"" movie despite its ""R"" rating.  This has been much talked about in Utah, with its predominantly LDS population usually shying away from ""R"" movies.  However, many have decided to go.We were both strongly affected by the movie.  For a 2 hr 15 min movie covering familiar territory from the Garden of Gethsemane to the first part of the Resurrection, it was amazing how fast it seemed to go, and that's for a movie in subtitles.  At two instances, during the brutal beating of the Savior in Pilate's courtyard and then again the nailing on the cross, I wept.  It was that powerful.  However, the movie was shockingly brutal -- which could be powerfully moving to some (after all, do we think the beatings and crucifixion were not brutal?) or simply disgusting to others not in that frame of mind.  The movie was dark from the start, beginning with the nighttime atonement in the Garden of Gethsemane, with the sweating drops of blood as it were.  I personally was positively and spiritually affected, on balance, by the experience.  My wife was more horrified and would rather that she had not gone.  The movie was well done on many levels, especially considering the difficulty in putting out a subtitled religious movie.There were only a few minor doctrinal issues I might take with the movie, though the Christ is put forth much more like the LDS image as opposed to the traditional Catholic image.We would never have our daughters at the ages of 13 and 11 see this movie. Our sons (16 & 18) are a maybe, the oldest probably would be fine.  I would put the minimum age at 16 to see the movie.  I don't think a 14-year-old, on average, should see it.I encourage all of you to see it if you are in the right (wanting, not overly affected by the brutality, able to take it in context) frame of mind. If not, skip it and read the New Testament.",The Passion of the Christ

If this overrated chainsaw massacre was speeded up to real time, the movie would be about 3 minutes long. The only worthwhile acting done is by the body makeup. Everyone else just stares into space. I'm sure someone will interject their religious mythology into how this film makes any sense but if a man was sliced, pummeled, chopped, pierced, stomped, punched, crushed, ripped, pounced and smote as often as the main character was, he'd be dead by the opening credits.

This is the best shot, best acted sustained whupping you are ever gonna see. That being said, I guess it is effective in a very over the top way in saying something about Jesus. It actually reminded me of Blackhawk Down in a way; both are all about the action and light on characterization or dialogue. The Roman soldiers are pretty much cartoon characters and the few really interesting characters like Christ's mother are given too little to say or do. Pilate hints at having some depth but it's all shunted aside to get to the beatings, whippings etc. Cavaziel does an ok job as Jesus; he's finely stoic but that's it. He's not given many directions to go in I guess so we don't really get too much depth or range from him but what he does show is fine. Overall this movie is mainly an oddity. Take away the Christian context and a similar film would be judged unwatcheable by most people.",The Passion of the Christ
431,XFLRWF,Gibson's passionate gift,10,29 February 2004,"Powerfully emotional and spiritually uplifting only begins to describe Mel Gibson's latest feature, `The Passion of the Christ.'  The film is also a multi-dimensional masterpiece focusing on family and love and not just on the beatings and the crucifixion.  The controversial movie, which depicts Christ's last hours on earth, is not the average biopic of Jesus healing the sick and preaching sermons.  Rather, it is an explicit, in-depth look at the punishment and suffering Christ endured for the sins of mankind.  Gibson's interpretation of the Gospel is vividly presented through creative camera shots and a commanding performance by the cast.	The high priests of Jerusalem, who decree Jesus' claim to being the Messiah as blasphemy, pay Judas (Luca Lionello) 30 pieces of silver to lead them to Jesus and have Him arrested.  In these last hours prior to His known execution, Jesus (Jim Caviezel) prays to God that the Almighty's will be done.  Jesus is arrested, flogged, and brought before Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov) for judgment.  Unwilling to condemn a man he deems innocent but also wanting to avoid an uprising, Pilate hands Jesus over to the people who demand that He be crucified for His heresy.  Jesus undergoes extreme torture and ultimately crucifixion for the sins of the word as it is stated in the Bible.         After almost ten years since directing the Academy award-winning `Braveheart', director Mel Gibson goes behind the camera once again and delivers another beautiful epic with `The Passion of the Christ.'  Gibson's omnipresent eye brings the audience into every aspect of the trial and punishment of Jesus.  This attention to detail, however, serves as a blessing and curse; particularly when the director focuses on the crucifixion.  Gibson's does not hide the viciousness of the penalty from the audience and draws them in to feel Christ's pain.  Not withstanding the brutality that is portrayed in the film, Gibson also tugs at the hearts of theatre patrons by capturing the love between mother and son in Mary and Jesus.  Gibson's directorial skill not only creates a strong emotional response within the audience but also brings them in to experience the events of Christ. 	 Many films have been made which detail the life of Jesus but none with the care and precision that Mel Gibson put into `The Passion of the Christ'. Taken almost directly from the Biblical books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Gibson co-wrote his interpretation of the Gospels with television and film writer Benedict Fitzgerald.  The script, originally written in English, was translated into Latin and Aramaic through the help of Jesuit priest Bill Fulco, S.J.  As such, the film is done in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitles.  The translation is a key element as without it, the film may very well have lost its emotionally stirring edge.  When the characters speak and converse in the ancient languages, they pull the audience into the realism of the time.  The translation makes each speech more forceful and moving as evident when Caviezel as Jesus preaches and prays in the ancient tongue.  Moviegoers can sense as if they are right beside Jesus and He is speaking directly to them. 	        No matter the size of the role, each actor delivers a phenomenal performance.  Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Christ is done with a more humanistic nature that is rarely seen in other representations of the character.  Caviezel plays Jesus not as a god but as a man.  He is a human being scared of the burden He must bear and the forthcoming punishments He will soon receive.  Caviezel's talents are especially shown during the flogging and crucifixion scenes.  The audience feels the pain exhibited by Caviezel as his body is continually beaten.  Caviezel goes to extremes and delivers a heart wrenching performance that entrances audiences and may just reaffirm the faith of others.  Maia Morgenstern plays Mary as a follower of Christ but who is first and foremost a mother.  She will pick him up if He falls down and stands by Him devotedly throughout his ordeal.  Morgenstern reveals Mary as a loving mother who is rightfully distressed with the torment that her firstborn undergoes and yet she must stand by and allow God's will to be done.  This love and pain is expertly played by Morgenstern and will touch the hearts of moviegoers.  The outstanding supporting roles belong to Hristo Shopov as Pilate, Rosalinda Celentano as Satan, and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene.  Shopov's Pilate is seen as a man struggling to keep order within his region.  He does not see any reason to condemn Jesus but does what he must do to prevent any uprisings.  Shopov's portrayal of Pilate is also done with the same humanity that Caviezel does with Jesus. Shopov's Pilate is not a man who readily sentences Jesus to die but a leader who labors with the decision of sentencing an innocent man or allow for mob rule.  A female Satan is rarely played and is excellently done by Celentano. Appearing at all the key moments of Christ's trials, Celentano continually mocks Jesus and dares Him to give up the cross and often without saying a word.  Her facial expressions and taunts at Jesus emit an evil feeling throughout the film.  Bellucci does not have many lines in her role as Mary Magdalene.  However, she hardly needs any words to bring about the caring and love from her character.  Bellucci portrays Magdalene as a committed follower of Jesus and a source of comfort to His mother.  All this is achieved through her actions.  Bellucci's Magdalene is a woman who lets her deeds speak for themselves. 	       Gibson's film, though marred by controversy, is powerful and touching.  The film does not set out to put blame on anyone but rather to deliver and portray the Biblical message of why Jesus died on the cross. The graphic nature of the film does not make it a family movie nor is it for the weak of heart.  But the film is as emotional as it is graphic and those who will have the benefit of watching this great epic will be moved to tears.  As with the `The 10 Commandments' and `Ben-Hur', `The Passion of the Christ' is a Biblical epic that will surely be remembered for years to come.",The Passion of the Christ
432,sdillon-1,"Riveting, shockingly bloody and profoundly moving",10,2 March 2004,"Let me say one thing straight away: go and see this film.  Over the years there have been several versions of this story, some good (Jesus of Nazareth), some terrible (The Last Temptation of Christ) and some completely dull and overrated (the Jesus film that's been translated into umpteen languages).  However, none are anywhere near as disturbing, violent and staggeringly powerful as The Passion of the Christ, unquestionably the definitive cinematic rendering.Whether one is a Christian or not, this is an undoubted work of art and a triumph for director Mel Gibson.  Beautifully directed and acted, the dialogue, spoken in flawless Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic adds a rare authenticity.  Based on the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John (with some creative licence) the film covers the last 12 hours of Jesus' life with flashbacks to past events.  The film opens at night in the atmospheric garden of Gethsemane, with Jesus being tempted by Satan as he prays to God in anguish.  His subsequent betrayal, arrest, trial and crucifixion are riveting.  Jim Caviezel is mesmerising as Jesus, and is ably supported by a cast of relative unknowns.  Maia Morgenstern is particularly potent as Mary, whose looks and glances infuse powerful emotion.  Luca Lionello's Judas is very effective, and Satan, a creepily androgynous figure played brilliantly by Rosalinda Celentano, adds an intriguing spiritual dimension to the film.As a director, Gibson has advanced considerably since Braveheart.  His use of slow motion and imaginative camera angles beautifully accentuate the already potent mix.  The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is beautiful, evoking the religious paintings of Italian artist Caravaggio.  The music score by John Debney is also very good.Some have criticised the film for showing too much blood and gore and not enough of Jesus' ministry.  I disagree for two reasons.  First, adding more flashbacks would have diluted the dramatic power and focus of the picture. Second, the brief flashbacks that are there show just enough to whet the appetite, leaving unanswered questions which will encourage non-Christians to either read the Bible or question their Christian friends. 
Whilst the violence is intense (particularly the scourging sequence) it is restrained compared with what Romans actually did in crucifixions.  For example, victims were stripped naked.  Gibson says he wanted to push the audience to the edge.  This he certainly does.  He also says he `backed off a bit' from showing the full horror.  This he also does.  Therefore, it's certainly not a film for children, but for older teenagers and adults. 
What I do find baffling are critics who said the film was too violent, yet consistently recommend countless other films with horrendous violence. These people are hypocrites and cannot have it both ways, just because the film upsets their particular sensibilities.  Of course, the Bible says the cross is an offence to some people and salvation to others.  Such polarised views will no doubt continue until the end of time.Which brings me to the second main controversy surrounding the film.  It has come under fire from some Jewish groups for anti-Semitism.  As a Jew myself, let me say most emphatically that The Passion is not intentionally anti-Semitic.  The film does not exceed the gospels in its portrayal of corrupt religious leaders.  It also goes out of its way to show the dissenting voices in the Jewish council, sympathetic Jews such as Simon of Cyrene, the disciples, and of course Jesus himself.  Great art by its very nature is dangerous in that it has power for good or evil and the potential for misinterpretation.  Unfortunately, over the centuries many groups and people have grossly misread the Bible.  It is understandable that the Jewish community is cautious.  One line deleted from the subtitles (but not the soundtrack) is the notorious `blood libel' from Matthew 27 verse 25, `His blood be on us and our children.'  Traditionally, this line has been interpreted as a curse on the Jewish people and has been misquoted down the centuries as a means of blaming the Jews for Christ's death.  What this fails to take into account is that it was God's will for Jesus to die, for all our sins.  Furthermore, in Acts chapters 2 and 3, many of that same Jewish mob who pronounced that curse on themselves become some of the first Christians.  Thus `His blood be on us and our children' becomes a blessing rather than a curse, as indeed Jesus said on the cross `Father forgive them, for they know not what they do' and the apostle Peter concedes in Acts 3 verse 17 that the mob acted in ignorance.  Therefore, to read anti-Semitism into either the Bible or the film is preposterous.  I understand why Mel Gibson took Matthew 25 verse 27 out, but I think he should have been brave and left it in.In conclusion, I urge you in the strongest possible terms to see this masterpiece.  This is riveting, shockingly bloody and profoundly moving cinema.  A must-see movie both artistically, and if you're a Christian, spiritually.",The Passion of the Christ
433,yak-yak,"Brutal, realistic, impacting, and technically very good.",9,25 February 2004,"No spoilers here. But really, what's to give away?I read some professional reviews by those with a lot to say and the skill to say it well. I'll just add my two cents for what it's worth.This film is about the torture and death of Jesus of Nazareth. It is definitely a very physical, very emotional, and very bloody work. It will have an impact on any viewer not made of stone. You won't hang yourself from a tree when it's over, but you won't be smiling, not for a while.The English subtitles are big and white and easy to read. It works very well in the film to have the people speak in the original Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew. The acting by the few main speaking players was very good, some of the physical roles were also played very well, and everyone else was just there. Since the movie takes place in the span of about 12 hours, there's no time to get to know anyone who doesn't have much to say.Technically, the movie was done very well. I could only see two or three simple technical errors, one of which distracted me from the film briefly, another is common in many movies. No problem. I won't point them out. If you don't notice them, great, you were doing what you were meant to be doing.Overall, it was a fine piece of work. Brutal, realistic, and impacting. One poor lady was sobbing halfway through the movie, and she was still there sobbing with her family when I left, long after the lights came on.I give it 9/10 if such a thing can be given a score at all.Wow.",The Passion of the Christ

The devil also kept appearing but that was not needed i think. this has been called a snuff movie by certain people but i totally disagree ,this was a personal tribute to the passion by Mel Gibson and the movie is so much better for it.

437,KMM,An Amazing Experience,10,8 March 2004,"Having watched The Passion of The Christ a few times in theaters now, I can only say that it has been a spectacular cinematic experience.  I would have liked to have seen more done with the Resurrection, but the film was still very powerful. As I was done watching the film, I was emotionally drained, yet spiritually filled, as I knew what that brief moment on film (the Resurrection) meant to me personally as a Christian. The movie takes God's truth from Scripture and puts it right in your face. I commend Mel Gibson for having the courage to show on screen what Christians already know when Christ died on the cross for all of usSatan had lost the battle; truth and love prevailed! This movie was a portrayal of exactly what it was: good versus evil.I know no motion picture can truly capture what Christ went through for us as sinners, but as I watched the scourging scenes and His walk to Calvary, I was deeply moved to tears on numerous occasions. The imagery of what occurred onscreen had a profound and humbling effect on me.  I have read many reactions to the film by other Christians and I feel the following from another person online describes best how I felt about the viewing experience:`I can't tell you how the movie will affect you, any more than I can tell you what God's plan is for your life. If you have rejected Him, you may see yourself in the mob. If you have denied Him, you may see yourself in Peter. If you have made fun of Him, you may see yourself in the Roman soldiers. If you have allowed Him to save you from your sinful life, you may see yourself in Mary Magdalene.'If you have studied Scripture (not just read it, but studied it) then you will understand that this movie is by no means anti-Semitic, as many reviewers of the film have felt after viewing it. All I can say is that you either get the message of the Scripture, or you don't.  Sure, Jesus Christ could have prevented all the suffering he endured before it even started, but as mentioned in Scripture and in the movie at the Garden of Gethsemane, this was part of a bigger plan that was meant to happen because of God's will and love for ALL of us.  Christ underwent great agony as he accepted God's will knowing that great betrayal and suffering were to come shortly thereafter. As is the case with many other films, The Passion of The Christ will affect different people in different ways. Most Christians will watch the film and understand why, for the context of the film, there will be a lot of violence. The title of the film alone tells it all. The Passion, or suffering, of The Christ. As I watched the film all I could think about was what really went on 2000 years ago in Jerusalem. I understood that the person on screen was not the actual Christ, but the dialogue and visual imagery onscreen reminded me of what went on as Christ staggered and struggled to Golgotha to be crucified. Even in his most agonizing moments all he could think about was love and forgiveness towards his enemies; moments, which were further supported by the flashbacks to earlier times among his Apostles and followers.  This is the message I got from the film, not hate the Jews or anything else. It amazes me how people can watch this film and not understand that this was what Mel Gibson was trying to get across to his audience. It was clear as day to me. Why not to so many others. The main performers in the film, especially Jim Caviezel (Jesus) gave outstanding performances, as did Maia Morgenstern as Mary and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene. Another moving thing about the film was the musical score, which was timeless and beautiful.  It definitely helped make the film that much more powerful. Also, viewing the film in Aramaic and Latin added to the mood and setting giving it an almost documentary like feeling as the film progressed. As was the case in other testimonials I have read about the film, the audience I was with sat in stunned silence as the credits rolled, and then one by one began to quietly leave. I believe it was because many who watch this movie will see a little bit of themselves in each character. I know I did. Please watch the movie as soon as you can.

438,PeterJordan,Though provoking,8,13 August 2006,"I watched this film not quite sure in what vein to approach it. On one hand the negative publicity or perhaps intentional smear campaign alleging anti Semitism left me very curious, On the other hand the clambering of the right wing fundamentalists left me somewhat suspicious and sceptical. What I experienced was a powerful, very graphic and definitely emotive piece of film making, which most certainly offers considerable food for though. This charge that this is an anti Semitic movie was to the forefront of on my mind as I sat through the 2 hrs and 40 odd minutes of the film. But overall I could find little justification for the charge. True there are some very nasty portrayals of Jews in Mel Gibson's movie, The high priests in particular but also the mob and rabble they manage to raise up and bribe out in the middle of the night, come out particularly badly in this movie, but then this was always the case also, in the four Gospels on which this movie is based. Out of the advance criticisms, I didn't expect to encounter any positive portrayals of Jews in this movie, yet they are considerable. The few high priests who council caution and question the charges being levelled against Jesus (Who are swallowed up and chased away by the mob for their efforts!), Simon of Cyrene who is called in to carry the cross for Jesus and for his trouble get abused and name called in tones that could be straight out of 'Schindlers List', The young woman who comforts her own daughter before she goes to bring Jesus a drink of water after he has fallen for the third time.Of course if one wants to be hyper critical (Or sensitive, depending on your level of political correctness!) the Romans don't come out of this movie at all well either. The centurions that take a perverse pleasure and a great deal of entertainment, as well as pouting masculine rivalry, in dealing out the scourging to Jesus, whilst they vie to flay strips of skin off his torso, are deeply disturbing in the same way as the most sadistically portrayed prison or concentration camp guards from a host of previous movies. Mind you this movie did reflect something that I've always been inclined to feel myself yet which I've rarely seen portrayed in other movies, namely that Pontius Pilate was, by and large, a good man caught in a very difficult situation, which admittedly he wasn't brave or strong enough to stand up to, despite his best efforts at compromise. He did near everything he could to release Jesus, stopping just short of provoking a riot and finally washing his hands of the affair and all apparently at the instigation of or for the love of his wife who felt deeply at the wrong being perpetrated.I have little need to outline the plot of this movie. A thousand gospel stories and many previous movies have already paved the way. It begins with Jesus' agony of waiting for his impending death in the garden of Gethsemane and follows through, pretty much word for word, to the crucifixion and resurrection in the tomb with occasional flashbacks to his childhood, his works as a carpenter, his sermon on the mount, the last supper and his rescue of Mary Magdalene amongst other scenes. One of the wonderful things about it is that it is all in Aramaic (The actual language of Jesus and Palestine/Galilee 2000 years ago) and Latin with subtitles, so that even that most dramatic of cries from Good Friday ""Eli Eli Lama Sabachthani?"" (Father, father why have you forsaken me?) is rendered in its apparent original.The movie carries the distinct imprint of Mel Gibson and makes more than a few nods to Braveheart, from its slo-mo sequences, to the wonderfully haunting soundtrack and the graphic-ness of the gore, right down to the squelch of nails penetrating flesh and the spurting of blood. More than once in this movie you will find yourself physically wincing from the sheer vividness of what is portrayed on screen, you sense the pain of the passion which I think is the ultimate intention of Gibson and an indication of his brilliance in crafting this movie.This is not a pleasant movie nor an especially attractive one, thought there are moments of truly moving beauty in it, in the portrayal of the tenderness of the Christ, The love of a mother, The pieta at the foot of the cross borrowed from Michelangelo himself and the horror of both Judas and Peter in their moments of weakness. I don't know whether it will make a better person of those who see it or whether it will bring people closer to God, but it certainly projects all the pain, determination and an indication of the immense love it must have taken for a man to give up his own live for the sins of all men, two thousand odd years ago and, if only for that alone, it's worth seeing.",The Passion of the Christ
439,lkl6411,More than Awesome - A Masterpiece of a Movie,10,27 February 2004,"Seeing the Passion of the Christ is an experience no Christian, at least, should miss.  I realize Mel Gibson needed to use some creative license, but reading some of the posts and critics' reviews about ""Jesus wasn't tortured, he was beaten"", and that the violence was ""over the top"" etc. really frustrate me.Those who watched his interview on Primetime Live, or have done some research, know that Gibson based much of his movie on the writings of Catherine Emmerich and other Christian ""Mystics"", who through visions from God, wrote detailed accounts of Christ's actual crucifixion.  And, Gibson actually lightened things up a bit by allowing the ""flashback scenes"" for respite during the scourging and walk to the crucifixion.  Gibson apparently poured through literally thousands of documents and writings to portray the passion as factually as possible; he also relied on guidance from the Holy Spirit.  For those who can't fathom visions from God, guidance from the Holy Spirit, etc., these are matters of faith, and can't be rationalized, so I won't try.  But, as difficult as taking in Jesus' very-human anxiety in the Garden of Gethsemane, his scourging and ultimate death on the cross were, they appeared to me less as violence than as immense suffering for the love of all mankind.As a mom, the scenes with Mary and Jesus were the most heartbreaking of all. I rarely cry in everyday life, but I had a hard time keeping my eyes dry throughout the movie.  It was a once in a lifetime experience and I pray the love and bond I feel for Christ today never fades.  I appreciate His suffering so much more than just reading about it could ever convey, and I want to be a better person for the rest of my life, because I understand with greater clarity, how much He loves me/us.This movie can improve the life of anyone who sees it, and who wants to receive its message: of forgiveness, of hope and of everlasting life.",The Passion of the Christ
440,happiscotsman,Why this film means what it means...to me,10,11 April 2009,"While every filmmaker wants to reach a large audience, the actual effect will usually boil down to an individual experience. So it is with ""The Passion of the Christ"". Notice how Jesus makes an impression on individuals throughout the movie. His mother Mary; Satan; His disciples John, Peter, and Judas; Mary Magdalen; Pontius Pilate, his wife, lieutenant Abenader; the High Priest Caiphas; Simon of Cyrene; and the unnamed soldiers who crucify Him. I make no judgment on the reaction of others, how I see it is what remains with me. I am a Born-Again Christian, and therefore a movie that concerns the act that forms the foundation of my beliefs will effect me differently than an atheist who challenges it, a skeptic who questions it, a movie critic who analyzes it, or even another Christian who has seen it. But why I value this film is because of how Mel Gibson portrays it, not simply because it is about Jesus Christ. I've seen other movies about or with Jesus in them, but none where nearly every scene has effected me deeply. I credit Gibson and his team for making this happen. This should stand as his masterpiece, and the career performances for much of the cast. The standouts are Caviezel's Christ of course, but also the commanding presence of Hristo Shopov as Pilate, Rosalindo Celenato's haunting Satan, and Pietro Sarubbi's manic Barabbas. This film is just too powerful and well done to be missed. See it and draw your own conclusions. For me, it will never make my Top Ten list because it exists outside of entertainment value. But there was no reason it could not have won Academy Awards in several categories had it been nominated.",The Passion of the Christ
441,slappytheclown,Absolutely Relentless,10,25 February 2004,"Breathtaking, relentless, visceral and brutal.  I remember a scene where one of the characters spoke to Jesus and said ""Just a little more, its almost over"" and I felt like the director was talking to me. Charges of ""excessive violence"" by Americans (I am one) strike me as lacking in morally authority.  This was not violence for the sake of violence; it had a point. Christians basic belief that Jesus had to suffer pain for our offenses made it necessary to push the envelope here, and not let us off the hook. An inspiring, challenging movie.  I can't say I liked it; that would be brutal.  So let me say this instead: I needed it.",The Passion of the Christ
442,brown1982,"Gorefest, yes; Anti-Semitic, no.",8,28 February 2004,"As a Christian who sometimes questions my faith, and having read lots of reviews with keen interest, I was expecting something between the ultimate faith-boosting movie experience and an anti-Semitic gore fest. It was an experience, that's for sure. But I'm still not finished processing everything.  One thing I am sure about.  For my taste there was way too much blood.  I know Mel Gibson wanted the audience to appreciate the sacrifice of Christ.  He didn't HAVE to suffer; he was God and could have called the whole thing off.  It's still a mystery and will always be and I still go round and round with my faith, but in the end I'm still going to believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah. HOWEVER, as for the movie...I think there are better ways to convey suffering than to repeatedly show bloody disgusting wounds.  I liked the flashbacks to Jesus' life before the Passion. I think there was a sufficient amount of them, actually.  I read reviews in which critics thought there weren't enough flashbacks.  Was the movie anti-Semitic?  How does one define ""anti-Semitic"".  Did the movie put down Jews? Not from my perspective. It portrayed Jews as dignified and religious.  The Romans looked like a bunch of violent buffoons.  The Jewish leaders were doing their religious duty by condemning a man they were convinced was a blasphemer.  The movie also made a point to convey that there were several Jews who truly believed that Jesus was the son of God. Maybe I'm ignorant, but I am thoroughly confused at how this movie could be anti-Semitic.  Jesus was Jewish. I love historical, period films.  I always wonder though, what did Jesus and the disciples and the two Marys REALLY look like.  I don't think they resembled how the old artists portrayed them, but I still take comfort in seeing everything on screen have the same ""look"" of the stations of the cross, and the old masters' paintings. If I didn't have to keep covering my eyes, I'd give it a 10/10.  So 2 points off for excessive gore.  I give it 8/10",The Passion of the Christ
443,rumfoord,"Failed to realize potential, gratuitous violence instead",2,12 August 2004,"My faith has nothing to do with this. The cinemaphile part of me is what aches when I watch this film. With the possible exception of Pilot, Gibson reduces all the characters to flat 2 dimensional vectors. And then he proceeds to perpetrate rather extreme violence on the audience. The cinematography was decent, but the representation of the devil was laughably ham-fisted. There was certainly some potential in the story. I would have liked to explore some of the ambiguities of the story. But no, Gibson isn't about exploration, he's about shoving saddistic violence down the throats of the audience.Incidentally, the R rating of this film in america is revealing, especially in contrast to Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers"" which received an NC-17 rating for a few relatively mild sexual scenes. What kind of culture allows parents to bring their 14 year old children to see this kind of incredible level of violence, but shuns the most natural of sexual acts?",The Passion of the Christ
444,Mappyman,Guro,6,2 January 2005,"The Passion of The Christ focuses on the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. It begins where Jesus has gone to pray after sitting the Last Supper. He is then arrested and taken within the city walls where leaders of the confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a violent beating and then to crucifixion. For further plot synopsis...read the Bible. All scores are out of a possible 10: Story: 8 - Great. Very well told with actual quotes and keeps completely true to the IL book. Even if you have no idea what The Bible is (living under a rock?) the story pieces things together so you get background story of who Jesus is and why the things happen to him. Acting: 8 - The main actor who played Jesus did an outstanding job. He really really looked to be suffering. The sounds and expressions he made really get to you, right down there really. All other actors also did well, Pontius Pilate also had a really good role and acted great for his scene. The executioners were drunk with stupidity and wicked laughter so their part was fairly easy. The woman who played as Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) was also very eerie looking, and did well in her role, especially the shaved eyebrows! Music: 7 - Nothing too great. Most times you would hear drum beats and flutes. Some chanting & moaning almost Enya-like music. Still, it fit the scenes well. Sound Mix: 9 - Very very well done. All of the loud clashing really hits you. And the screaming of crowds is really loud too. Camera-work / Lighting: 7 - There were lots of views from different angles of the mountain he is crucified on. The closeups really showed what pain he was in and the dark expressions on some of the evil people in the movie, Satan in particular. There were some quick shots that scared you a bit too. Editing: 7- Overall time for the whole movie's time line is only from when Jesus is captured to when he dies, so its not the story of Christ, just the final moments, but during the movie there's a lot of scenes to explain parts of his past. Scenes of him as a carpenter, scenes of the last supper, and a few miracles he performed. It pieces this all together well but could have explained more. Uniqueness: 7- There's been Bible movies before and other Jesus movies, but this one was dedicated to going into full detail about the actual crucifixion. It did well but still seemed to have parts missing to fill in some questions people have about Jesus' past. Worth: 7- Worth watching at least once. Not a late night movie with friends or girlfriend, but more if you're in a real deep mood and want to see just how much Jesus suffered in his final moments. For the weak of heart, this can be passed up for another action movie. Overall Score (Not an average): 8 - Its a well made movie. The subtitles for the Aramaic / Latin / Hebrew spoken dialogue was definitely a good idea to keep the setting extremely true to the real event as told by the Bible. The initial shock from the violent beatings in the movie will definitely surprise most people and children should definitely be warned before viewing this. For a broad audience its not that great of a movie as its mainly just the ending to the full story of Jesus. Religious followers might also be turned by the violence but fascinated by the accuracy of the movie in comparison to the Bible. Reviewer's Insight (Including bias): First off, the previews before the movie were Agent Cody Banks 2 & Spiderman 2. Maybe i'm wrong but this movie was definitely cut out for adults, so why preview kid's movies? I had heard about this movie about a year ago when it was getting a lot of controversy over being released (and at that time it was simply ""The Passion"") and i totally see why. Even though my church pastor previewed the movie telling us ""Everyone Should Go Watch This"", i'd say it is more for dedicated people who already know the story of Jesus and can actually stomach the intense violence in this. More nitpicking! The entire theater smelled like old grannies, mainly since the audience felt like a church because of all the old people watching. I thought there'd be a more varied audience than church goers. The lady next to me had the shaky-leg thing going too, especially during the intensely violent scenes. I liked how Jesus is pronounced ""Yesh-wah"" in Hebrew. It rolls off the tongue better",The Passion of the Christ
445,purban,Indeed antisemitic and homophobic,1,1 March 2004,"Even as a Christian (and it's unfortunate that I feel I have to open with that true statement to lend myself some credibility), I was rather disgusted by this movie. I think the accusations that the movie are antisemitic are indeed founded. The primary ""villain"" of the piece is the most Jewish looking character in the whole film, and is almost a caricature. Granted, he was a pharisee and followed certain guidelines regarding appearance, but no other Jewish characters were depicted similarly. More compelling evidence supporting prejudice in the film, however, is in the obvious representation of two other main villains as gay. Satan looks to be a very effeminate man (played actually by a woman), and Herod is shown wearing makeup and has gay mannerisms (and should have been much older, no?). Again, no other characters are represented in such a way. Because of this triumvirate of caricatured villains, the film seems in every sense a representation of Mel Gibson's beliefs and, frankly, some of his beliefs make me uncomfortable or angry.I believe he and his film are antisemitic and homophobic.Considering this, the scene in which Joseph puts his arm around Jesus while carrying the cross seems more like a Harriet Beecher Stowe move, to me (she may have written Uncle Tom's Cabin with sympathy for some characters, but in the end, still wished black people to return to Africa--in other words, a few sympathetic depictions of Jewish characters do not mean the film is not antisemitic).As a representation of Mel Gibson's beliefs, I think some people who believe similarly or are willing to overlook certain flaws may be moved by the picture. However, they are likely moved more by existing belief than anything that is actually created in the film.This film did not challenge or inspire me intellectually or spiritually, and I saw nothing new or highly original in the film. I was not moved by the violence.The moments of Jesus carrying the cross and his crucifixion were somewhat redeeming on an emotional level, likely because the focus became Jesus rather than the violence that was inflicted on him, and those that showed him sympathy actually were putting into practice his teachings. Unfortunately, these character-driven moments were too few and fleeting. The cinematography and performances were fine. For the most part, however, I think these positives are overshadowed by the bland nature of the film and the depictions of some of the characters that were to me quite offensive.This film was a missed opportunity. As a representation of one man's personal beliefs, I frankly just don't care about it very much.",The Passion of the Christ

We are born sinful, fallen short of the perfect standard of God, unable to earn our way to him. But God, in his great love and mercy, sent His son to this earth to live the perfect life that we could not and to die the death that we all deserve, taking upon his shoulders the burden of the sin of all, so that all who call and believe on the name of Jesus Christ might be reconciled to God, forgiven of their sins and granted eternal life!A beautiful film that is guaranteed to make you cry if you understand the weight of what this film depicts.",The Passion of the Christ

There isn't any insight into his spiritual suffering. The Last Temptation of Christ of Christ is far more insightful in that regard.Furthermore, I think that this movie is deeply anti Jewish. At the end, God basically says boo and the Romans scatter. The Romans are the ones who actually did the crucifying. The Jewish leaders in the movie merely condemn Jesus with words, and God destroys their temple. It seems that the movie is sending the message that it is worse to condemn Jesus with words than it is to kill him. That's a frightening thought. Mel's recent escapades with the police serve as further confirmation of his anti-Semitism.",The Passion of the Christ
448,mikestollov,Appeals to the worst possible level of religious emotions. Lame & narrow exploitation.,1,7 September 2004,"A gore fest, far more worthy of B Movie, slasher status. This has little to do with the bible & everything to do with Medieval European ""Passion Plays"".This film goes absolutely nowhere, it's all basically a long, drawn out torture scene. Quite what this was meant to achieve is beyond me..... nah, it's Mel Gibson's Retirement Fund, that's obvious.Playing in to the current, post millennial religious fervor Gibson comes up with a cynical manipulation of the Christian Bible. I used to think that John Wayne drawling ""Truly this is the on of Gawd!"" as an abomination, but Gibson's film puts all the 1950s & 60s Hollywood Bible epics to shame. At least they pretty much stuck to the story, whereas Gibson simply milks the violence. Like the nails that are so lovingly shown being hammered home, this film knows no shame when it comes to audience manipulation.As a guilt trip (you're a sinner/Christ died for your sins/so if you sin you're guilty/repent/loathe yourself etc etc) it probably appeals to a huge section of Christians who will throw all they've got at it & ensure that Gibson never has to work again. Just wait for the ""Special Edition DVD"", then the ""Easter Special Edition"", then the ""Christmas Wonder Special Edition"", ad nauseous.Is there anything positive? Well the direction & camera work are often very good & sometimes impressive. Caviezel seems set for bigger thing, giving a eye catching performance, albeit when he's allowed to & not simply being an inanimate object for punishment.Apart from that there's little else to say. Gibson has obviously hit upon a theme, but deals with his target audience on the most exploitative level. One wonders who's the bigger fool, Gibson for making this tripe or the audience for being so willing to gobble it down wholesale.",The Passion of the Christ
449,critic_w,"Once you set the controversy aside, all you have left is an excellent movie!",9,2 March 2004,"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" is very hard to watch. That's not a criticism; it's just a reality. The movie has gone somewhere that no other movie about this event has ever gone stark realism. Did he HAVE to go this route? No, but why shouldn't he have? Everyone who has ever read the written version of this knows that it was just plain awful, and very hard to watch. In fact, if we were actually there, most of us would have turned away. Likewise, in this movie, many viewers are at times forced to cringe, tightly squeeze their eyes shut, or otherwise turn away. This movie is the most excellent and realistic depiction of the horrible whipping, brutal beating, and inhumanely cruel form of capital punishment endured in an incomprehensible act of sacrificial love.It is also a brilliant piece of filmmaking. From the use of first century languages, (Latin, Hebrew, and Aramaic) and the symbolic interpretations of evil and temptation, to the beautiful (seemingly authentic) score and heartbreaking examples of love, the viewer is actually left wanting for more in spite of all the pain. Mr. Gibson's film manages to portray a Jesus that we would have loved to known. He seems like a very nice guy. His relationship with his mother seemed so tender and healthy, and his disciples all seem to like him as opposed to simple revere him. There's just so much hope.When we see him treated so cruelly, perhaps more cruelly than anyone has shown anyone treated on film, it is, quite frankly, very hard, and borders on the unbelievable. But this also is not a criticism. Again, the movie has chosen to go where others have not. It asks us to watch the results of whip on skin, and actually counts the number of blows given in this type of scourging. To see that on film IS hard to believe! It forces us to ask, who could take such a beating! And more controversially, who would deliver such a beating. No one would want such a charge laid at their feet. The movie does show that the Romans were cruel (even monstrous) and Jewish leaders were pig-headed, and ultimately responsible for the death sentence placed on Jesus. Does it do so incongruently with text from which it is derived? No. It is as accurate as any one director can be in one movie. Mel Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald have pulled from various passages of scripture to piece together the best depiction that they could. I would argue that it is the best depiction that has ever been.But then there's the controversy. My take is, if you believe that Jesus Christ was and is the Son of God, and He really did come here to be a sacrifice for all mankind, then by definition your life's goal is to bring the world to that understanding. Someone HAD to sentence Him to death. And someone HAD to carry out His crucifixion. If it weren't the Jews and the Romans, it would have been the Greeks and the Babylonians, or the Africans and the Assyrians, or whoever. It wasn't by mistake that He died, nor did anyone ""take"" his life. The Bible is clear; God ordained it, and Jesus ""laid down"" His life. Anyone with ANY belief at all should be all the more concerned for those who God selected to do the deed. They need Him as much as any of us, and are by far the least likely to feel open to receive Him as the Son of God. Conversely, if you do not believe Jesus was the Christ, then this movie is simply a gut wrenchingly close-up view of the cruelty of man, and the cruel death sentence of a great man; whose followers would continue to grow in number until this day. It has no basis to cause tension and hatred toward any one group of people for the very reasons just stated. Those who believe will be spurn to do more to help non-believers see it their way. Those who don't won't. And as for those who are simply looking for an excuse to hate, and a reason to be cruel? Well, it's better they are dug out from their demonic places here and now and exposed them to the light so that they too can find the true meaning of love and sacrifice that this movie is all about.Sure it's very hard to watch. Everyone cheers to know that a parent would place their life in jeopardy for the sake of their children, but no one wants to see them actually die a cruel death. And at the very least, we all need to know that the children were grateful, and grew up to honor the memory of their parents as decent and contributing members of society. This is where ""The Passion of the Christ"" leaves you. You so desperately want to know that all that sacrifice was worth it, that the whole world would honor the memory of His death. Your heart is left in limbo, your emotions are wrought and ragged, and you are mentally unable to account for the two hours and 6 minutes that have gone by. Sure it was painful, and chances are you cried, winced, and at times hid your face from it yet you are left so desperately wanting for more; More of the hope that all will be better now.",The Passion of the Christ

The story is widely known I suppose but this version is really what I would call ""hardcore"". Although I like horror and splatter-movies as Quentin Tarantino's ""From Dusk till Dawn"" or ""Kill Bill"" and am thus used to the presentation of blood and violence in films, this one was too much even for my taste.

If the most positive thing that people can remember about the LIFE of Christ was his death, if it takes a visual interpretation of the Crucifixion to stir your emotions because the words of the Bible don't do anything for you, than I'm not the only one who needs to go back to Sunday School.I did not go see this movie en masse with the rest of the congregation because the story of Jesus really isn't something we should line up to buy tickets for in all eagerness to watch a man be slaughtered. If people lined up and paid money for 2 hours of emotional depth in a movie theater to feel better about themselves, they could have gone to church, which is usually accompanied by free punch and cookies afterward.Media hype treats it as if it was a spiritual awakening for them to see a movie of about Christ while the book they've undoubtedly got at home sits in a drawer somewhere collecting dust. No one should feel obligated to see any movie, that's not what movies are fundamentally about. They should go to movies to be entertained.I think the real tragedy in the death of Christ was that he believed in the best of us, in each person's capacity for goodness, but more times than not we end up betraying not only his trust but his memory. There were only brief moments where I saw Jesus the teacher, Jesus the philosopher, and Jesus the friend to outcasts. That's how I remember the guy.

I had major doubts, having been familiar with him only from Count of Monte Cristo, and I was pleasantly surprised. He did an enviable job, kudos.I thought that the attempt at authenticity which provided us with the language of the film was admirable. Although I'm really not much of a Mel Gibson fan in any regard, I have to give him credit for his passion (no pun intended, naturally) and attention to detail in many parts of this film.The cinematography was fantastic, the character portrayals, although some aspects I found difficult because of my personal beliefs, were still very skillfully done for the intent of this film. It definitely managed to portray a range of cautious fears and uncertainties in the face of brutality, I respect that about the movie very much.I will disagree with those who call it a snuff film merely because the violence it portrays is historically accurate to its time and it is indeed that sort of violence that the Bible speaks rather clearly about. And since this is a movie about a part of the Bible, let's face it, it's merely accurate to it's source material.I will also say that I cannot see how this is a life-altering or faith- affirming experience. It's just a movie, really! No matter your faith, these are actors playing roles. Skillfully, yes. But nonetheless, still actors.I really didn't find it as heart-crushing as so many others did although I am a Christian, admittedly with beliefs that may vary greatly from other Christians. You want to see something that will really affect you in a gut-wrenching sort of way? Get yourself some tickets to Jesus Christ Superstar (only live will do) and watch the 39 lashes, for some reason this movie pales in comparison to me.Nonetheless, it's a good, solid piece of film making and if you're ever inclined (and don't mind subtitles), it's worth giving a watch.",The Passion of the Christ

Very few movies have ever gotten me more curious in advance than ""The Passion of the Christ,"" the first major testament of director/co-producer Mel Gibson's renewed Roman Catholic faith. Knowing Gibson primarily for his violent R rated action movies, his sudden public piety was a nice surprise to me. Though I'm a Protestant, I consider Catholic-Prostestant differences to be on secondary issues - not issues on which our eternal destinies hinge.Unlike other movies about Jesus, which tend to cover His full earthly life, ""The Passion of the Christ"" concentrates on the 12 hours from his arrest to his death on the cross. The movie seems to be largely Biblically accurate and much of the dialog is comprised of direct quotes from the Gospels. I don't think any of Satan's (played by Rosalinda Celentano) lines are from the Bible but they fit that character.Much of the commentary that I've heard about this movie deals with its intense, graphic violence. Word of mouth and reviews, particularly the words of Roger Ebert - ""This is the most violent film I have ever seen"" and ""If it had been anyone other than Jesus up on that cross, I have a feeling that NC-17 would have been automatic"" - had me bracing myself and preparing for the worst.While the movie is extremely violent and bloody, it wasn't quite as bad as I expected. It certainly merits its R rating but not an NC-17, in my opinion. It might be the most violent movie I've ever seen but I have to think about it. Perhaps my preparation for the violence made it seem not quite as bad as it really is.Nevertheless, Gibson unquestionably succeeded in his hope that the movie's ""message will change people's lives, remind them of the enormity of the sacrifice that was made for us all."" There have been several movies about Jesus that are much more comprehensive, but this is probably as close as any movie will ever get to portraying the suffering of Jesus as it happened. And the movie's flashbacks to such events as the last supper and the sermon on the mount help emphasize the significance of his sacrifice.Furthermore, this is the most professionally made Jesus movie I've ever seen and being in Latin and Aramaic - the DVD contains English and Spanish subtitle options - adds to its sense of realism. And a phenomenal performance by Caviezel tops it off. Playing a hydroplane racer from my hometown then playing Jesus and excelling at both is a monumental achievement that shows his amazing versatility.I'm also glad that the first Christian box office blockbuster of this generation was a movie like this rather than the speculative and sensationalistic end times movies that have saturated the Christian market in recent years.And I tremendously respect Gibson for sticking his neck out and expressing his faith so strongly in a field that is largely secular, left wing and anti-Christian.The DVD contains no special features which is not only disappointing, it's shocking for a new release of this magnitude. But that in no way changes what the movie accomplished.I'm not sure it would be accurate to say I ENJOYED ""The Passion of the Christ"" and I doubt I'll ever watch it again. But it made a very strong impression on me and I hope it opens the door for more quality Christian movies.",The Passion of the Christ
454,cdipatri,I'll never take His name in anger again.,10,9 March 2004,"I'm a non-believer in the church.  I believe in God and Jesus Christ, but I just don't subscribe to man-lead religious organizations.  This film moved me in many ways.  It was upsetting to see how Jesus may have been brutalized before crucifixion.  More than that, the enlightenment of seeing, in a very real way, how he suffered for our sins was felt deeply.  Mel Gibson should be applauded for his bold statement and beautiful film.  Although the film was undeniably brutal, it was done exceptionally well.  I was almost at the point of jumping up and trying to grab the flogging implements those two idiots were using to beat him with.  I was practically growling every time one of the soldiers whipped him as he carried the cross.  This was a moving film and must be seen in the theater to be fully appreciated.  Great applause also to the visual effects team who made every wound believable.  A beautiful film.  I can't wait for the DVD so I can own it.  Mel Gibson deserves every penny he will make from this.  It was so refreshing to see money spent on a story worthy of the big screen.",The Passion of the Christ
455,Roger-81,I saw this movie this weekend,10,8 March 2004,"and while I'm not a christian, I was very moved by this story of the brutalization of Jesus.  I did think Mel went over the top with the brutality, but I also think that was intentional because just when I thought I could not stand another blow, it would get worse.  He did not let up. Whether this is historically accurate or not, I don't know, but it did make the beatings, the crown of thorns and the crucifixion very real and very sad.  I was so moved by his mother, Mary. The agony she felt watching her son go through this was haunting.  I don't think it matters whether you are a christian or not..this was a very well made movie.  The cinematography was superb, as well as the acting and directing.  I think Mel is a very astute director and very talented.  I also don't understand where the claims of anti-semitism are coming from.  I saw this as a movie depicting man's cruelty to man.  If anything, the Romans were excessively cruel.  Does that make me hate Romans?  Who are Romans?  My point, I saw nothing in this movie that would make me hate any particular religion or culture.  More than anything just saddened me with the cruelty that is inflicted by humans on other humans.  That went on 2000 years ago and is still going on to this day. By all races and creeds.",The Passion of the Christ
456,rgoodden,Worth Seeing Again,10,1 January 2007,"This cinematic gem manages to transport a setting, story, and cast of characters known to all into the stuff of yet transfixing drama: a feat that only masterly film-making can successfully pull off.And to do so employing only exotic languages as script multiplies the wonder of the accomplishment. I recently sat for a third viewing of this movie and was again simply astounded by its perfection of casting and the shear artistry of its actors.Critics who seem to regard the religious inspiration behind the film's making as some sort of obscure ""threat"" are unfairly saddling a cinematic event with their own unhelpful biases. Others inclined to question its bloody portrayal of scourging, crucifixion and death in Roman times are perhaps ignorant of the realities of that (after all, well-documented) era when life was famously ""nasty, brutish and short.""This film's box office earnings speak for themselves. And justly so.",The Passion of the Christ
457,princesss_buttercup3,"""Even if you're a minority of one, the truth is the truth."" - MK Gandhi",8,19 June 2008,"I just returned from seeing ""The Passion"". This is the first time I can recall having such a compelling need to write something down, but without knowing where to begin or even exactly what I want to say. As you've probably read, the film has already inspired unprecedented controversy for two reasons. First, the utter brutality and violence of the persecution and crucifixion of Christ. And second, the alleged anti-Semitic perspective.On the first critique, I can't recall seeing a film that more graphically and viscerally portrays human physical suffering. It is incredibly difficult to watch, yet I could not take my eyes off the screen. I believe this is a credit to the actors, who manage to convey a level of spiritual suffering that transcends the physical infliction of pain. It is not only Christ's sacrifice, but that of Mary and the disciples, and by extension, everyone who came to know this individual and his message. It is the most human and touching of moments when Mary asks her son to let her die with him. And that simple message of pure love and profound loss is conveyed beautifully. It may have been possible to tell the story without the graphic violence, but it would not have been as profound. The story is not just about the persecution of Christ, but about the power of all-encompassing love, forgiveness, and spiritual strength. The message works precisely because Christ's physical suffering is something we can all identify with. It makes him more human, and thus makes his faith more remarkable.The second critique is hardly worth addressing. This is not to disparage my Jewish friends, but this film, like (my reading of) the gospels, is not about the special cruelty of one group or another. It is about human nature, and more specifically, human frailty, weakness, fear, and ambition. It is a comment on politics- the struggle to gain and keep power. To be fair to the film (and I don't think this gives too much away), while it is the Jewish priests who demand the crucifixion of Christ, it is the Roman guards who carry out their orders with a mixture of brutality and glee that would make any feeling person's skin crawl. Even Caiphus is shown repenting, albeit too late, for his blind ambition. If viewers, Jewish or gentile, saw the message as anti-Semitic, I believe that they have utterly missed the point. Jesus, like others who went both before and after him, had a message that challenged the prevailing wisdom, and thus, the legitimacy of the powers that be. To question the conventional wisdom, religious or ideological; to threaten the perception of what is widely believed or portrayed to be reality (and to do so in the quest for a larger truth)- well, it is the single most courageous act a person can commit. And often those who have done so- Socrates, Galileo, Gandhi, Sakharov- are condemned as crazy or criminal, as was Christ. But without the courage and faith of these individuals, humanity would not evolve.Which brings me to the main message of the film. As a friend so perfectly put it as we were parting ways in the parking lot, for all the criticism and analysis of Gibson's interpretation, the simple fact remains: we have not come very far. That is the real sorrow. I had read that audiences who saw early screenings had an unusual reaction at the conclusion, and my experience was no different. As the credits began to roll, the theater was silent. For nearly 10 minutes, no one moved or said a word. I imagine that it was a collective gathering-of-thoughts, a reverence and remembrance. Yet I can't help but think that once everyone finds themselves back in the safety and security of their own homes, the introspection will fade to a kind of distant nostalgia. Meanwhile, brutal wars and crimes against humanity rage on around the globe in the name of religion and righteousness and our own ""democratic"" leader calls for limits on equality and disguises it as piety. Human hypocrisy, ambition, and greed in the time of Christ is no rival for that which we are witness to today. In that sense, this film could not have been more timely. I hope we listen.",The Passion of the Christ
458,jasonsurety,What's new?,5,12 March 2004,"Fortunately for Mel Gibson, when a film is talked about as much as this one, people will go see it.  Unfortunately for the people that go see it, Mel Gibson has made a controversial film that teaches little while torturing a lot.  Unlike some films where violence plays an important role in the film's intention, The Passion isn't bringing something fresh to the screen.  This story is familiar to most people.  Retelling a story that has been told so many times before, only telling it in more graphic detail, is arguably irrelevant.For those who know the story, seeing Jesus tortured for a dismal length of time does not move nor does it educate.  Worse, if you are not acquainted with these events, The Passion is so confined to the arrest and execution of Jesus that virtually none of Jesus' teachings and life are depicted. Therefore, what are we to gain from this film: a better appreciation for Christ's pain and agony?  Any Christian who has had even the smallest teaching should be mindful of this.  Does it help us to see shreds of flesh and streams of flowing blood?  Personally, I wish I had not gone to see this film.  I feel like one of the many sheep who flocked to the theater because of hype.  One idea the movie really drives home is how horribly cruel people can be to another human being.  I already knew that, though.",The Passion of the Christ
459,shinymc_shine,The Film Of A Latter-day Sinner,7,28 May 2004,"""The Passion Of The Christ"", Mel Gibson's third output as director, is a mixed blessing. In one hand, there's a thoroughly researched, extremely visual, rich in detail, piece of art. While in the other, there's a clumsy, stereotypical, overemphasized film. This is an excessively bloody, biblical day in the life of Jesus Christ from his capture to crucifixion and resurrection.One of the pluses is the beautiful cinematography of Caleb Deschanel which resembles classically, iconic, religious paintings, bathed in a golden glow. His solid camera-work's never flashy apart from a few point of view shots through Christ's eyes. Lighting's realistic yet it has an aged look which adds much needed warmth to the film.Not a lot of directors can pull off mood in a film. There's an air of horror that lingers throughout. Everything from the clothes to the buildings appear lived in. You feel that you're watching a living painting on a larger than life canvas. The team of director Gibson, cinematographer Deschanel, the production and costume designer certainly have worked well together to produce this atmospheric film.A good example of Gibson's clumsiness is a flashback in which Jesus is at work building a ""high"" table for a rich client. The scene is extremely laughable in its attempt to convey that Jesus was a man ahead of his time. But couldn't Gibson have achieved this through speech in the same way the Bible uses words to get its message across.When attempting to capture reality, which seems to be Gibson's aim, it's a mistake to use film trickery such as slow-motion. He tries too hard to emphasize notable incidents in the passion story. There are other choices than slow-motion to bring something to an audiences' attention. The close-up, colour or stillness are better examples. Slow-motion only emphasizes that this is a film and a state of the art, expensive film at that. The authenticity would've been better served had he shot it more simply without modern film techniques at his disposal.While this was funded by Gibson, the dialogue is in a foreign tongue with English subtitles. As the film progresses, you realize how pedestrian the subtitles are. In a couple of scenes the word ""hey"" is used to get someone's attention. This is an extremely modern term and stands out immediately. Gibson co-wrote the screenplay but did he write it in English, then translating it, or was it the other way around. Although Martin Scorsese used contemporary American accents to draw middle-class audiences to his period, biblical interpretation, it seems that Gibson was thinking along the same lines with his subtitles. Ultimately, the words are too current and appear dumbed down for the average viewer.While the wording of the subtitles can be distracting, Gibson doesn't always feel the need to use them. Film's a visual medium and, as the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. He should be commended for not translating every word a character utters. The subtitles are used sparingly, are clear to see and are on screen long enough for a slower cinema goer to read.Jim Cavisel's the perfect choice to portray Jesus. His youthfulness is a reminder of the tragically short life Christ led. I've never understood how an actor can deliver foreign dialogue convincingly as if it's their first language. We believe every line that's spoken. This Jesus is calm, understanding but this specific time in his life is consumed by pain and the violent beatings becomes repetitive after awhile.You're constantly staring at Christ's eyes as Gibson's chosen to disregard the iconic, blue irises. The eyes, the say, are the windows of the soul and the story of Christ is filled with symbolism and subtext. Why choose to abandon his blue eyes? Blue's a naturalistic colour. The sky and the sea, two of nature's true mysteries, are blue. Other meanings include purity, liberty and calmness. So why choose red for Christ's eyes? There's too much red due to the bloody nature of the crucifixion and the ritual beatings caused by the Roman centurions.Another great casting choice was the actor playing the Devil incarnate. This actor appears androgynous, both male and female, though I believe it's a she. Scenes featuring the Devil are truly frightening, inhumanly creepy and grotesquely sickening. One scene in particular has the Devil nursing an adult looking baby that stays with you long after the film has ended. There are a few choice shock moments throughout that are expertly handled.A major percentage of critics have noted the levels of blood and brutality. But what repulses you most is how repetitive the violence and bloodshed is. Restraint's needed and maybe a more seasoned director would've known this. The Roman centurions who beat, kick, whip and spit on Jesus are depicted as sadistic, moronic Neanderthals. For such a resourceful, intelligent race who invented objects that are still in use today, they've been wrongfully represented. Use of make-up and appliances are realistic, gut wrenching and greatly add to Cavisel's afflicted performance.Overall, there's a great film here shining through the bad mistakes and poor choices. Gibson wears his heart on his sleeve but the problem is that he's too close to the film to see its flaws. By the way, when making a biblical film it's always a good idea to mention the source material you've adapted it from as it seems a little pretentious not to.",The Passion of the Christ

I guarantee you this, your heart will be touched. This movie isn't just about Christ getting beaten within an inch of His life and then hanged on a cross, it's about Him returning from the grave. He defeated death and proved that He was the Savior. You will never be the same after you see this movie. I challenge each of you to watch this movie.

461,john_murdoch2002,A Stunning and Perfect Motion Picture Experience,9,14 June 2004,"I fully believe that the end times are approaching. In the book of Revelations, it speaks of nation rising against nation and then all nations turning against the holy land. It also speaks of a time when those who believe in Christ and God will be persecuted. Outside of the seas boiling and the moon turning to blood, we are pretty close. With the media focusing on attacking Christianity (relentless focus on preacher abuse scandals and portraying religious people as thoughtless fanatics), we have fulfilled one prophecy and with the mess in the Middle East, another one is quickly being fulfilled. That's why watching The Passion of the Christ was such a powerful reminder for me of the passage: ""Watch ye for ye not know when the master of the house will return.""The film chronicles the last twelve hours of Jesus' life, from his betrayal in the garden of Gethsemene to his conviction at the hands of society to his eventual death. This is all done in a brutal and graphic display. We see his captors physically abusing him in custody, we see everyone around him mocking him and his word, we see the horrific punishment that he was originally sentenced to, we see his journey to the top of Mount Golgoth, and then his crucifixion. All of this is pretty graphic to watch because of the depth of the cruelty and some may argue that this is a bit excessive, but the bible does support this display, both in the book of John outlining his sentence of forty lashes and even noting that when he was presented, he was beaten so badly that he was unrecognizable. So this vision that Mel Gibson has chosen to portray may be difficult to watch, but is a vision from the bible that has been looked over for many years.And the violence is shocking. How shocking, you may ask? Shocking enough that in a society desensitized to violence and cruelty that it still managed gasps, tears, fainting, even in a few cases in this country, death. So this is one movie that is not for the squeamish. Yet, the film's primary focus isn't on the violence. It is juxtaposed with scenes from the last supper to scenes with the Sermon on the Mount in which Jesus talks about loving one's neighbor, despite the abuse you receive. It is through these scenes that the audience shows both reasons for Jesus' life on earth.And Mel Gibson himself has crafted this movie to perfection. The scenes are dramatically powerful, yet never overplayed so as to feel ostentatious or exaggerated. The emotions are overpowering and the drama of each moment is played perfectly, so an average audience, not accustomed to reading subtitles, can see the story vividly on the screen. Yet, the subtitles themselves are perfectly played, coming straight out of the bible and not feeling cheesy. And the brilliant photography by Caleb Deschenel paints the film like an old renaissance painting, bringing to mind the works of the Sistine Chapel.Some of the best moments in this movie occur without any words whatsoever. The sight of Judas being plagued by his demons, the moments Mary has in remembering her son and watching the reactions on her face, the betrayal in the garden, all of the scenes take place without one word, showing that images on the screen are infinitely more powerful than the words spoken on the screen. Not to discredit the script in anyway which does take a little dramatic license, but overall follows the exact words in the Bible perfectly.Faithful people believe that Jesus was brought to this world for two purposes, one is in his life be a living testament to God's love and power and the other was in his death to die for our sins. In his life, Jesus performed his Father's miracles, he spoke his Father's words, and lived his life avoiding sin to set an example for us on Earth to live a more heavenly life. Because Jesus was born a man, he bore the folly of all mankind since he was a divine figure who took the appearance of a mortal, which is why his death was so symbolic. For Jesus to suffer as much as he did at the hands of man, he took on the sins of mankind. So his death allowed the opportunity for man to be redeemed through Jesus' sacrifice.Overall, this is the finest film that I have ever seen. A movie has never moved me and influenced me that way that this film has. What this movie sets out to accomplish is to create a curiosity about religion. It makes people wonder the accuracy, the power, the affect it could have on those who watch it, and cause people to make a decision about their own faith, which I believe should be the goal of all art. As an audience, we take out of this film what we want. Some see it as anti-sematic, some see it as a film of tolerance, some will see it as a violent excessive film, some will see it as a peaceful film. That to me is a true success that a film can allow for differing viewpoints in such a debatable topic like religion. Gibson has accomplished just that with this film, bringing to life his interpretation of the crucifixion and even leaving much for the audience to wonder for themselves. So with fine form, this movie and Mel Gibson succeed.
I'd rate this film higher than a ten because I believe this is one film that actually transcends ratings and belongs to the ages. My words could go on forever, but I don't think I have enough to express the true greatness this film.",The Passion of the Christ

With that out of the way, let me first say that this film was, from a production standpoint, amazing. Acting, cinematography, makeup, unity of artistic vision - all are amazing.From my background as a Christian, I was moved by the severity of the depiction of Christ's suffering. Never before has it been so graphic, and never before has it been so powerful. If you are a Christian, this film will likely bring you to tears. For that reason, this movie is completely successful.That was my emotion/spiritual response. But I also had an intellectual response. And my brain had some questions at the end. The big question being one that has been made much of - why was the Roman leadership portrayed in such a positive and complex light, and yet Caiaphus and the majority of the Jewish leadership was portrayed as single-minded evil people. I wondered about that. I wondered why Mel Gibson had not included Caiaphus' line of doubt from the Gospel of John.Also in question was one of the last shots of the movie - the devil was in it and I think it was supposed to be a shot of Hell, but I wasn't sure. Eh. It didn't work for me.But overall impression - this is a moving film for Christians. Non-Christians would probably not respond in the same way.",The Passion of the Christ
463,toddinvestor,Gripping,10,11 February 2005,"With the close of 2004, looking back ""The Passion Of The Christ"" stands out for me as the best picture of the year. In my opinion, The Passion deserves Oscar nominations for both best director in Mel Gibson and best actor in James Caviezel. It received neither of course being out of the loop of the Hollywood empire. The Passion is also amazingly polarizing. Viewers tend to give it either a 10 or a 1, opposite ends of the scale. Nothing in 2004 gripped me from start to finish, mesmerized me with intense emotion or left such a visual and emotional impact as ""The Passion Of The Christ"". And this is from someone who was hesitant to see it at all. This is not a typical bible story. Believer or not, the suffering of Christ is a charged event brought to life by Mel Gibson's stellar efforts. If you are not sure whether or not to take this movie in, just see it! Yeah, maybe you will give it a 1, but is it not worth the risk that you might find instead a 10 out of 10? How many movies have that potential?

464,vgs1895,No words can summarize this movie,10,26 February 2004,"I went to the movie expecting to be disappointed after all the hype it has received.I wasn't.Literally speechless for hours after the movie, I still find that descriptive words about it fail me.  For most believers, this film will add to their infinitesimal comprehension of what our Lord suffered for the world.  For non-believing searchers of the truth, it may cause a deeper investigation into what Jesus is all about.  For atheists (many of whom wouldn't go anyway), perhaps it will cause some soul searching.As a person of mixed Jewish heritage, I was not offended at all.  Knowing Biblical history, I knew that God was, and had to be, ultimately responsible for Jesus' death.  If I hadn't known that, the movie still didn't give the impression that any one group of people ""killed"" Y'shua.This movie set out to condense the last 12 hours of Jesus into 2+ hours.  It did just that.  It made Him very real--as He should be. Artistically, Gibson did it right.  The actors played their parts perfectly (I was glad to see that Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew were spoken well--no obvious American or Italian accents).  Even though I don't speak those languages, I can recognize when a foreign language is poorly pronounced.  I am very glad Mel chose not to put anything in English--it would have ruined the attempt at authenticity.  I am also glad that many times he didn't put subtitles in the parts where we could easily figure out the gist of what was being said.To paraphrase a famous quote: For believers, no amount of negative hype will destroy their appreciation of this film.  For determined skeptics, no amount of positive hype will be sufficient.  Let's hope those in the middle will give this movie a chance.",The Passion of the Christ
465,lochnessmummy,Some moments of brilliance,7,3 March 2004,"This is a very good film, with some moments of true brilliance.  I didn't feel it was the bloodiest movie I've ever seen, nor was I spiritually moved by it.  The person I saw it with though, said ""yes"" to both of those things.Being a film about the death of Jesus, it's only fitting to focus all of the attention on him.  However, I wanted to know more about some of the other characters in the film.  The most poignant moments occur when Mary, Jesus mother, weeps hopelessly at the brutalization of her son.  I wanted to know a little more about her.  The apostle Peter is a key part of the first half of the film, but then gets dropped completely.  Finally, Satan here is portrayed with more dynamic corruption, more androgynous perversion, and more unspoken power than in any other film I've ever seen.  This juxtaposition between righteous divinity and supernatural malignancy is given far too little attention.The Passion also has a very linear composition to it, which doesn't help it any.As far as the controversy goes... yes, the Jewish leaders who pushed for Jesus' crucifixion are the clear villains in this film.  They're not nearly as evil though, as the sadistic Roman centurions who carry out the sentence. They're also not portrayed half as vile as the depraved, lunatic demons who have inhabited the Catholic priesthood according to Hollywood over the last decade.",The Passion of the Christ

He dies, and a couple of days later he revives.Here's the real question, what purpose does this movie really had? To tell a story? Not here, there is no story at all, just a torture-porn flick (one that truly embodies the term) using some trivial back story to unleash it's carnival of tortures upon the main character. The audience looking forward to this movie already knew what to expect, they already know the story, the characters, they didn't discover anything they didn't knew already.

Mel Gibson haters will see this as proof of his insanity & intolerance. Christians will see too much violence to be on a big screen. Humanists will see the shining truth that Christians are gullible fools willingly self deceived, but what about the movie making? The events that are being depicted here are detailed fairly well in the bible. Does the movie stay close to it's literary source as far as events & beatings & death? I say yes it does.Someone somewhere should get credit for putting that on the screen. Your sense of appropriate levels of violence really took a beating in this story as it's told in the Bible. Go complain there. The movie is a good pictorial representation of the subject matter it claims to cover which is, the suffering & death of a man known as Jesus Christ as revealed in a book about his life.You can claim that Jesus never existed. You can claim that these events never happened. You can claim all kinds of personal preferences but you can't claim that this is a bad movie because it didn't stay close to its literary source. You can't claim that it deliberately embellished that story. Mel Gibson certainly didn't create the story & since it wasn't intended to meet any other muster than its relationship to it's source I feel it must be highly rated as a movie & movie making.Are you offended by the show for some reason? The show doesn't care. It wasn't made to not offend. To belittle what was done on screen here is to belittle every movie that ever stayed close to its literary source. I understand that people will have deep feelings because of their personal beliefs but it's really sad to see a movie bring out the sentiments of either all opposition is based in stupidity or illogical beliefs or I'm a Christian so it's great & no discussion of the movie, its relationship to its source or it's crafting as a movie.The violence is deep, gritty & horrifying but the subject requires it from the source. It's not for everyone. Especially not young unformed personalities.You know, you can discuss death, even murder, with a little child but it has to be within his speech & comprehension level. You can show him pictures of death & murder that far exceed their speech & comprehension levels & these images most assuredly exceed what children can comprehend.I'd just like to see more individual evaluations. One's not based on the doctrines of a group, be it religious groups or any other.",The Passion of the Christ
469,yuenw003,"The message of Christ, an appropriate message for our times",10,25 August 2006,"There's a saying: Action speaks louder than words. If I could add another dimension to communications, I submit: Timing of a message speaks louder for its words. The message of Christ is so appropriate for our times. War is causing death, suffering, and despair to our fellow human beings in other parts of the world. When I saw this movie that dramatized the final days of Christ, I saw it as a strong anti-war message. Christ was a peaceful, non-violent activist. His words and teachings speaks for himself. This movie brilliantly focused on how the Roman soldiers and priests took pleasure in hating someone who did nothing to them, except speak the truth and be the truth. Denial will cause men to create their own truths, because facing the real truth is too unbearable. And so it was that the high priests made a case for destroying Jesus by accusing him of heresy because they feared the real truth that he was the prophesied messiah. I picked out a few quotes from Christ, which in context of the movie, says it all. ""Live by the sword, die by the sword."" ""I am the truth, the light and the way."" And as Christ underwent so much suffering on the cross, he didn't direct anger, revenge or hate to those who persecuted him for no apparent reason but instead said: ""Forgive them my Lord, for they do not know what they do.""",The Passion of the Christ

471,filmLove-2,Mel Misses The Mark,1,15 April 2004,"A catharsis for Mel, but a mess for us. Mr. Gibson's well-intentioned effort to find God and save his soul has yielded a film lacking insight and wrought with hyperbole and exaggeration to the point of caricature. Pontius Pilate, historically known for his excess and brutality, is portrayed as a sympathetic and indifferent soul. This is certain to mislead the naive moviegoer.  The Passion of The Christ exhibits so much physical violence and horror, we are transported to a state of numbness so the full meaning of Jesus' life and his noble mission are lost. As I left the theatre at the film's end, I watched audience members file out of the auditorium dazed and disturbed instead of being awed, filled with wonder and uplifted. If you wish to experience a splendid cinematic event and gain insight into the meaning of Jesus' life and the beautiful message he brought us, I urge you to see King of Kings(1961) or the superb Ben-Hur(1959), the winner of no less than 11 well-deserved Academy Awards. No, The Passion of The Christ is not overtly anti-Semitic; however, those who wish to promote anti-Semitism might just find this film a most useful tool.  Because Mel misses the mark, we are forced to endure a low-grade docudrama laden with brutality. Had Mel hit the nail on the head, we would have witnessed a brilliant cinematic event and left the theatre with our spirit soaring!
Bear in mind this is a very personal film, and what you bring to it will have an enormous effect on how you perceive it.See it for yourself, and make up your own mind.",The Passion of the Christ

I am not a Church goer, I don't even consider myself religious but I was immensely touched by what I witnessed on the screen.   I have never been so moved by a film in my life, I feel I have not the words to describe how I feel about this whole experience.  I just know I witnessed something very special.  I am not going to go on about the story but as Cecil B Demille once said it is, 'the greatest story ever told'A lot of credit should go to Mel Gibson for making what was always going to be a very difficult film because of the very nature of the work.",The Passion of the Christ
473,carface-2,What the fuzz is all about?,8,13 April 2004,"I am no religious fanatic or an avid bible reader, but I thought this movie is engaging and fairly realistic. The movie is passionately made filled with raw emotion. The use of Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin is amazing and they omitted other dialects (Greeks etc.) for simplicity.A critic accused of those who praised the movie while they panned Kill Bill are hypocritical. I don't agree with him because the use of violence in the Passion serves as purpose of sacrifice of a man for everyone and not revenge.Is it anti-Semitic? No. In fact movies like ""Stigmata"", ""Da Vinci Code"" (Vatican portrayed as thugs), ""Magdalene Sisters"" (sadistic priest) and ""The body"" (Vatican as sore losers) are far more biased and you'll find that the Passion isn't as an anti-Semitic as some people claimed and this movie is neither an attack on Jewish faith or the Jewish people. One scene show some of the Jewish high priests disagree about Jesus accusation and the Jewish leader did not show any sign of pleasure about Jesus' torture. The Jewish police did beat him up, but not as gruesome as the Roman. For those who think Pilate is too nice, think again. If the Jewish high priest want Jesus dead, why did not the Pilate ask the high priest to torture Jesus or at least skip the lengthy march with a heavy cross and just nailed him right away? This movie proves that Pilate isn't too nice after all.The Flaw is that King Herod and Barabas seem a bit cartoonish. Some part of the film has some ""unintended"" humor like the Barabas scene so I chuckled a bit.So like what Jesus said that love your enemy and forgive them ;)

474,nankipoo,Nothing to compare to.,10,8 September 2004,"I purposely put off seeing this film when it was initially released, and have just seen it for the first time on DVD in my home, with my children sitting close by. The furor raised by the critics and commentators concerning the ultra-realistic punishments and abuse heaped on Jesus in this movie kept me away, I'm sorry to say. When I finally did sit down and watch it, it wasn't the scourging or the crucifixion that stayed with me, but the masterful manner in which Mel Gibson had unfolded this most familiar of stories. There was no wasted motion or dialogue, even though the film is just over 2 hours long. I don't think that one has to be a theologian to understand that ""The Passion"" indicts all of us (humanity) equally; personally, I think that the charges of anti-semitism are empty and misplaced. The Bible clearly states that Jesus voluntarily gave himself to be The Sacrifice, and that includes everyone, from Caiaphas to Pilate to me and you. Real people were certainly involved in seeing to Jesus' physical suffering and death, but I shudder to think what I would have done if I had lived in Jerusalem in those days.This film is absolutely a must-see for anyone who thought that any predecessor film didn't fully depict Christ's agony. It also does something that I have never seen in a film about Jesus: it shows Him at home with His mother, working as a carpenter, and sharing a humorous moment with her. With that brief scene, Gibson shows us the humanity of Jesus: He did laugh and smile, and He got hungry. Usually, storytellers create a cool, scripture-quoting Jesus, who dies as if He were taking a nap. But not here. When Gibson's Jesus dies, you will feel relief. ""The Passion"" has taken this story and asked us to look at what happened when unbelievable cruelty was swallowed up by an even more incredible love.Much better than I imagined it could be. 9/10",The Passion of the Christ
475,cmivie,"A film that everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY, should see!",8,22 March 2004,"First of all, let me state that I am a christian. I want to get that out before I start my review of this film. So, here goes.Well, Mel Gibson has done it. He went against the flow, against liberal minded Hollywood and made a box-office smash by re-telling the story of Jesus. And he did it by telling it the way it was meant to be told. Hollywood takes certain liberties when telling a story from the bible (like Noah's Ark) and to be fair and honest, Gibson takes some of these liberties as well (as in the presence of Satan). I know that theologians, or some of them, have a problem with Satan being in the film. My response to that is that I feel it is totally asanine to think that Satan wasn't their tormenting Jesus during his final hours. The guy is evil ya know, and you can bet that he was their trying to convince Jesus that he did not need to die for mankind's sins.Now, as for it being anti-semetic. I didn't get the impression that ""The Passion"" was directed to make everyone hate the Jews. The Jews wanted Jesus to be crucified because they belived him to be a blasphemer. Yet, they needed the Romans to carry this out because they themselves could not do it. The Romans are the ones who beat Jesus to a pulp, who ridicule him as they beat him. If anything, the movie makes you hate or dispise the soldiers who do this to Jesus. Yet, their are Jews in the movies who do believe Jesus is the Messiah, and you see the pain they go through watching Jesus suffer for them. If anyone gets the feeling that this film is anti-semetic, then that person (or persons) either has some sort of agenda or is very narrow-minded.So, how was the film? It definitely leaves you speechless after it ends. My wife and I went about 10-15 minutes before we talked about it. My mother asked me how good it was, and I could not answer her back. This is one film that you have to see and give your own opinion. So, now let me try to put down how I felt about it.It is an epic film that is wonderfully directed and the acting is very good. The score for the film is passionate and powerful and the cinematography is excellent. This film probably won't get any Oscar nominations, but it should. Their are two performances worth mentioning. First, is Jim Caviezel as Jesus. He is wonderful at bringing out the love of Christ as well as his determination at fulfilling his duty. Second, is the guy who plays Pilate. I have always envisioned Pilate as a man who, though powerful, was fragile. In ""The Passion"" Pilate is displayed as such.Now, about the violence. While this is a great story, this movie makes it more realistic than any other. You will see a side to this story you never have, and that is when Jesus is beaten by the Roman soldiers. It is violent to say the least, but that is how it should be. Their is no way to sugar coat this (even though in all Passion plays you never see it because, well, because they are done in Church). Mel wants you to see and know the suffering Christ went through, and he does not hold back. But, he also shows you the suffering that the followers went through, most notably Magdelene and Mary (his mother). I like this touch, because it brings realism to the story. The Jews who don't believe are satisfied that Jesus is being punished, the Jews who do believe suffer to seeing Jesus go through this ordeal, and Jesus suffers but knows he is doing the will of the Father. That is as realistic as you can get.Overall, this is a film everyone should see, and I do mean everyone. If it leaves you with questions, then I suggest seeking out someone who knows theology (preferably a minister or evangelist) to help you understand. I'm guessing that is what Mel intended. He wanted folks to seek more information. Not just unsaved, but also saved people.",The Passion of the Christ
476,NYLux,"One of the Best, most Powerful depictions of the Passion",10,20 August 2009,"This film stands out for the quality of the direction. We see the story of the Passion unfold quite naturally as part of a time and place, yet the subtle grace and powerful nature of both Christ and the Virgin Mary separate them from the rest, giving a new understanding to the meaning of divinity. This is the very first film in which I realized why the Virgin was a necessary witness in the passion: She was there to support the human body and nature of Christ and help him battle the enemy on the last stand. The silent communication between them is one of the many masterful details of this extraordinary film. The use of the original languages is extremely helpful in understanding the relations and cultures of the people involved. An excellent rendition in all details. The violence used was strict to the scripture, it's just never been shown before the way it was. It also helps clarify why Christ fell twice on his way to the crucifixion, and died so quickly. The moment of death was a great inspiration: Even the brutalized Roman soldiery realize they are witnessing something completely out of the ordinary, which actually applies to the whole movie.",The Passion of the Christ

After I watched it, I think i created a Tsunami in the cinema. It was so accurate to the real story of Jesus Christ.Mel Gibson, he worked so hard and the Jewish people are not proud of the effort he put into this film. I respect him even more now than I ever did. So Mel rock on as you should.I would say if you ever want to see such a powerful masterpiece of a movie, watch this one and become a religious fanatic.

479,capncrusty,Jesus H Christ,3,10 December 2005,"It's probably true that the people best qualified to judge ""The Passion of the Christ"" solely on its merits as a film are those with no specific metaphysical ax to grind, yet having some familiarity with the appropriate mythos and its various multicultural manifestations. As a Western agnostic, I would like to think that my POV might therefore be of some worth.What the hell; I'll give it a whirl.This movie could have run easily in half the time. Brutish men beat helpless nice guy to pulp, then nail him to a cross-tree: bad. Most of us get that kind of thing fairly quickly; those whom remain unconvinced that the execution of Jesus Christ was any more than one in a long series of mankind's inhuman acts aren't likely to see things otherwise, no matter how many times barbed whips rend bloody flesh. Indeed, I quickly found myself with my head propped in my hand, stifling a yawn, wishing the senseless savagery would either morph into a plot, or come to an end. One wonders, then, what Mel Gibson had in mind, producing two-plus hours of little else. I'm guessing here, but it may simply be as many have subsequently said: Max is indeed Mad.Faith has a tendency to do that. Physicist Steven Weinberg stated: ""With or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion."" Knowing truth may indeed set one free, but making it up only sets one loose. There's a world of hurt running rampant because some group of the credulous and easily misled grab hold of an internally-consistent verification of their own fantasies, then go out gibbering into the streets with it. It's the kind of thing that can stamp reason into the ground quicker than a Legionnaire's calceus.Take the claim that the movie was anti-Semitic. Yes, many Jews were portrayed in an unfavorable light...but to me it seemed that the Romans came off even worse, if wanton cruelty trumps venality. Where, then, are the cries of ""anti-Latinic""? If my above premise is valid, then when ""faith"" is involved, Jews are just as likely to behave as barbarically as anyone else. Nuts is nuts; and I'm afraid that crimes committed in the recent past, no matter how thuggish, do not grant the victims an eternal ""king's X"".Overall, I'd have to say that ""Passion""'s only saving grace (pun? not intended) was a few scenes that worked for atmosphere.

481,wbagot1,Breathtaking,10,26 February 2004,"Mel Gibson has created a powerful movie on the passion of Christ that has never before been seen.  That he chose to do it with his own money, use subtitles, and still make the movie a success after being rejected by the major distributors is a testimony to his savvy and tenacity.There were a few things that struck me that I didn't expect based on the negative press that the film received.  Firstly, the film is anti-Roman. The only group that is viewed as enjoying inflicting misery and suffering for the sake of inflicting it are the Romans.  There are many more sympathetic Jewish characters than there are Roman.  Mel actually creates a role for Simon of Cyrene where he is defending Jesus and helping him while the Romans are laughing and call him a Jew.  He is seen as very noble, and very Jewish.  Oddly, that scene is not brought up by reviews that stress negative Jewish content.The film is violent.  Do not take children.  It is meant to touch a deep spiritual core and has succeed in audiences across the nation.  The audience left after the same silent reflection that I last experienced with watching Schindler's List.  Both are powerful movies.Hearing the movie in Aramaic and Latin added an air of authenticity.  It certainly adds a nice touch.  Oddly, you stop noticing this as the movie goes on.  As you read the subtitles, it's almost like they're speaking English.Unlike some other Jesus films, the Jesus in this film didn't look like an effeminate man who would blow away at the first strong wind or have piercing blue eyes that would be very unlikely in Palestine at that time.  He had the type of body one would expect from a carpenter and did a remarkable job filling the role.  Although the actor's eyes are blue, they were colored to be greenish brown for the film.Although the movie is viewed as violent, and rightfully so, it follows many of the customs that were common at that particular period of time and does follow the Bible rather well.  The crucifixion scene is actually downplayed versus the way it would have been in reality.The only real point of contention that I had was that I found myself wanting to see more of Jesus' life and His teachings.  But, that wasn't the focus of the movie.  The flashbacks were great, but without narration anyone not already familiar with the Bible would have trouble placing them and knowing what was occurring.From what it set out to do, show the passion and suffering of Christ, the movie is superb.  It is recommended for anyone who would have an interest in this area.",The Passion of the Christ
482,deamond9,Damn! I was looking forward to saying it sucked.,7,27 November 2006,"(WARNING; SOME READERS MAY BE OFFENDED) I rented this movie because, unlike the Christians who protested ""Dogma"", I believe you should watch a movie, THEN make fun of it. Otherwise, that would be like saying Dungeons & Dragons promotes Satanism without actually reading the manual first.Mind you, I actually turned on the ""Audio Descriptive"" feature. This is a DVD feature that only some DVDs have, designed for blind people. Normally they stop talking during the duologue. Howevere, since all the duologue was in dead languages anyway, the audio descriptive kept going thought the movie. Much better way to see it.Funny thing, all the ""Good"" Jews (Jesus, Mary, Mary, etc) have small European noses, whereas all the ""Bad"" Jews (everyone else) has huge noses. one of the biggest was on the nose of a murderer. I think his makeup was a bit over-the-top.Visually, Jesus himself was based on the typical depiction of Jesus, which is based on the Shroud of Turin, which was faked by Leonardo Da Vinci. Whereas all the other Jews were based on Nazi clichés. Especially the murderer.The storyline basically starts and ends at the same place as ""Jesus Christ Superstar"". The violence wasn't bad, and there's plenty of it. It's basically a movie about a guy getting tortured.I actually felt sorry for Conscious Pilot, actually. Here's a guy, trying to help a poor psycho who refuses to help himself. He's like, ""Look, I think you're innocent, I wanna let you go. Just say you're innocent, say you're guilty, but just help me help you."" King Herrod has only one scene and isn't depicted in a flattering light, but really he's like Anesthasia's Grandmother; he's been waiting for the Mesiah to come, and he's been looking forward to it as much as anyone, but is convinced that THIS guy is a fake.The Devil is depicted as an odd looking pale androgynous balled thing with no eyebrows. At one point, while Jesus is carrying his own cross, The Devil is holding a weird looking baby (The Antichrist?) That kid was just ugly for ugly's sake. It wasn't a child at all, it was a really ugly little person, like Baby Herman without the charm.

WE thoroughly agreed that it was the most anti-semitic film we had ever seen and those who see it otherwise are not seeing it through their whole brain.  I think this might be a  SPOILER.  The badly beaten Jesus is ""standing before a crowd of Jews"".  The Romans are actually saying he has had enough and to let him go as he has been punished enough, but the Jewish crowd in the courtyard are screaming ""Crucify! Crucify! Crucify!""  How can I not feel that it is anti-Semitic?  Neither my friend nor I are Jewish, but this is the way we saw it!

I cannot comment of the truth of falsity of Christianity.All I can comment on is the quality of this film and I can say, hand on heart, that it is the worst I have seen in a long time.I am told that Mel Gibson finds inspiration in the writings of German mystic Katherine Von Emmerick whose writings boarder on the sadomasochistic and I think that is true. Whatever else I do not believe it was as bad as depicted on this film. Yes Jesus was sentenced to death for being a rabble rouser but I doubt he was treated any worse than anyone else. I think he would have been dead long before he got to the hill if he had undergone what is depicted here.More importantly I do not get any sense of Jesus, or the disciples, as human beings. The scenes are all formulaic. What made Jesus special is ignored. A scene with his mother inserted for this purpose could be anyone with his mother - not someone whose teachings have influences billions of people.If this film inspires people in their Christian faith then that is wonderful, and I'm not being sarcastic.

485,sober_gaijin,Amazing ...,10,26 February 2004,"I put a single adjective to describe my reaction to the film, but looking at the word in print it does not do the film justice.  In short, this was one of the most emotional experiences I have ever had in the theater.  Christ's Passion is intense, gut-wrenching, angst-ridden and agonizing, yet throughout the narrative the immeasurable Love of God is ever so apparent.But divorce ourselves from the spiritual message a moment.  Is it a good film?  It is certainly well-made.  Yes, Gibson did his homework regarding the Gospels, but there are numerous elements from the Elizabethan Passion Plays that are not explicitly described in the Bible (for instance, the Roman guard dislocating Christ's shoulder so His palm would align with a peg-hole on the crossbeam).  There are also numerous images taken from the great Renaissance paintings and sculptures of Christ, many of them universally recognizable, some requiring a little homework.  As far as films go, this one is powerful and visually stunning.  As far as films about Christ go, it's much more.I realized during certain scenes that had I been ignorant of the Gospels and of Christ's Love, I might have found some of the violence bordering on exploitation.  But as a Believer, I was more moved than offended by the brutality.  For those who think this movie is too much--that the violence is too graphic--perhaps your heart is not in the right place.  This much brutality is only exploitative when taken out of context.  If the acts of violence in this film were going on in one of the countless Nazi Love Camp movies from the 70s, then you'd have a beef.  But in the context of Christ's Passion, can it ever be too much?",The Passion of the Christ
486,smit815,Overall I Liked Jesus of Nazareth Better,9,1 March 2004,"This is a great movie - but overall I prefer Jesus of Nazareth. I felt more emotion at the point of the crucifixion in Jesus of Nazareth because in essence I had spent 5 hours previously getting to know the personality of the man who was being crucified. In Passion, I liked the strength both physically and characteristically that Jim Caviezel (spelling?)exuded was the best of all Jesus' I have seen. I wish though I had seen more of the playfulness Jesus as seen when he was making the table. I wish I could have added the warmth of Bruce Marchiano as he portrayed Jesus in the Matthew series.The resurrection was the best I have seen - it was minimal and showed that after all was said and done, Jesus was still with us.Maia Morgenstern was excellent. the actress playing Mary Magdalene was beautiful; but nowhere does the Bible say that she was the woman caught in adultery.Satan was subtle and the best I have seen played as well.Finally, I understand why Jews may be concerned about their portrayal in this movie. But my impression is that Mel Gibson actually played down the determination of the Jewish leaders to have Jesus killed. They violated many of the Roman and Jewish laws to have Jesus crucified. But we all have to remember that this execution was more politically motivated than religiously motivated. But Jesus was as determined to go to the cross as much as people were determined to put him there. It is almost as if Jesus committed suicide by Roman guard. It was his choice to die for the sins of humanity.Andy Smith",The Passion of the Christ
487,jiujitsu_jesus,A bloody mess,2,19 December 2004,"Before I went to see this film, many people described it to me as being too Hollywood. Then I saw it - and given the abysmal acting quality, virtually nonexistent script and irksome visual effects, I would rather describe it as Holy Wood. It's a pointless, lifeless, shameless controversy-grabber that doesn't deserve any of the accolades it gets.In summary, this is a two-hour bloodbath of a film, re-enacting, in excruciatingly tiresome detail, the more macabre bits of Jesus' last day on Earth. Ego-actor Jim Caviezel headlines as the Messiah himself, with a performance so woeful as to send the viewer into a stupor. He stumbles through his Aramaic lines, barely able to suppress his accent, whilst the rest of the cast use him as a piñata-cum-pincushion. Not that he, or anyone else for that matter, has many lines- close to ninety percent of the production is devoted to whippings, beatings, bludgeonings, peltings, lashings, and the interminable crucifixion scene. Interspersed throughout is an attempt to instill a religious element, with a few flashbacks, and a couple of crazy spitting albinos that are supposed to represent Satan. In short, the film leaves it to the power of your faith to guide you through the story. Unfortunately, not everybody will perceive a two-hour bastinado with more blood than KILL BILL as a spiritual experience.It's as if Mel Gibson is using the film's theme to cover his limitations as a director - ""You can't sledge me for having a crummy script this time! I didn't write it! I took it out of the Bible! SO THERE!"" Well, I've got news for you, Mel - adapting a Bible story to the screen requires some serious thought as to a universally acceptable interpretation, and your ""Holy Wood"" approach is a little too commercial for the likes of me.Finally, to appease the die-hard fans. I do not like Mel Gibson's films, but not because of his religious and political tendencies. I am writing this comment simply from a film buff's point of view. Everyone has their own perception of religious literature, and in the end, you may find, in THE PASSION OF THE Christ, an appropriate companion to the Biblical story.But you certainly won't find anything that lives up to all the hype and controversy.

489,silverrain-4,"Another excuse for blood and gore, this time with Jesus as the main theme",2,10 August 2006,"So, I finally got to see 'The Passion of the Christ', just to see what all the fuss is about. First off, as there are no records about any of this, we cannot judge its accuracy. The Bible is no proof; it is merely a collection of stories from unreliable sources. So, did Jesus exist? Who knows. Believe what you will. Your faith is your own and you're entitled to it. Was there an Osiris? Quite possibly. Same thing. The origins of the modern Bible begin forty years after Jesus' death, so no-one knows how accurate they are. If you believe in Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit, then they must exist. If you don't, then they don't. It's quite simple. OK, that's the religious/faith aspect dealt with, now the movie. Remember, this is Mel Gibson's beliefs and interpretations and he is entitled to them. This is just a movie; other discussions belong in your church group. There are two possible interpretations for this movie. The first is that it is an accurate portrayal of the last hours of Jesus' life, based on what we know of Roman cruelty, and the second is that it is just another platform for the portrayal of violence by filmmakers. Either way, I personally see no reason for the movie other than it being almost two hours of incessant violence, and representative of Man's inhumanity to Man. If it is true, then nothing much has changed in two millennia. If Jesus were to arrive on Earth today, this is quite possibly how he would be welcomed by the religious fraternity, their entire existence being borne of violence, death, torture and murder. Argue anyone? I gave this effort 2/10 for cinematography.",The Passion of the Christ

This movie was brutal, but Mel Gibson said in an interview in Readers Digest...Psalmists say that Jesus was beaten so badly he did not look human...so we were spared THAT...the actor separated his shoulder and was struck by lightning while filming but the Christians believe in the reserection and that is the POINT of this movie...in order to get to that miracle...Jesus endured the pain for THE SINS OF MANKIND....the movie was graphic but HAD TO BE...I loved Jeffrey Hunter and Max Von Sydow....but this was REALISTIC...I just wish that Mel gave us more information about WHY HE HAD SO MANY FOLLOWERS AND SHOW SOME MIRACLES in the flashbacks...and maybe a bit more of the ""glorius ending""....I gave it a 9....LOVE is the message...HE LOVED US.",The Passion of the Christ
491,mtr0118,Moving and touching show of the passion...,8,23 October 2006,"Mel Gibson's effort to relate the gospel of Jesus' passion really hit thousands when people went to see this film. No one one expecting it to be moving and really graphic though it was announced months before its release. At least when I finished watching it, I felt that I just walked out of an ER room without the proper anesthesia. Especially when it came to the scene where Jesus was nearly flogged to death. Just seeing all that blood splattered and his flesh shredded made me realize the reality of Roman flogging and torture. Jim Caviezel should of got an Oscar for his valiant effort since I heard that in certain scene he really did separate his shoulder.I loved the part where Jesus consoled his mother by quoting Apocalpisis 21:5-Look Im making all things new-.The Resurrection scene really caught my eye and consoled me after see Caviezel's Christ tortured to death.This film along with The Gospel of John(2003) bring me back the memories of what the 1950's and 1960's were when biblical films were filmed often.",The Passion of the Christ
492,The_Jihadi,Jesus Christ Revisited...,8,24 August 2008,"By hearing lots of controversial reviews about this film i thought to give it a try by watching it. I will frankly admit here that i am not a Big Fan of Mel Gibson movies . Frankly speaking, I was a little hesitant about the film maker Mel Gibson as i am very less familiar with his Acting Skills because i had very few of his work, Maybe one or two that includes Braveheart. But when i watched this movie, I now feel like getting this film in my personal collection which is now a MUST for me.James Caviezel or Jim Caviezel (Jesus) is arrested and brought in front of the governor. Everyone wants him to be crucified. This is the story that is short but told in the format of a Feature Film. There are some scenes that you have NOT seen in any earlier Jesus Films till date. The scene where the Christ is tortured is an approximately 12 minutes footage that somewhere also gives a Believer a Pain! Performancewise, This film altogether belongs to the protagonist Jim Caviezel (Jesus). He comes up with a brilliant performance. Monica Bellucci was again a good cast in the movie. She hardly had any lines to speak but it was altogether a Performance Oriented part. Maia Morgenstern (Mary) also did her great part with a Brilliance. This kind of acting is sure to give you tears in your eyes. NOTE: The scene where Jesus fells down while carrying the Cross, And Mary runs to him to console. The background score was a plus in this movie. It really scares and makes you emotional at the same time.As i wrote earlier, I was a little hesitant by the film maker on this movie, But i am very glad to say that the Film Maker proved me wrong here. Mel Gibson (Who is also the Screen writer) handled this script in a very brilliant way. The cinematography and the Special Effects added feather to Mel's cap. I will go ahead and strongly recommend this movie to Christ Film Lover as it stands up to all the expectations!!!",The Passion of the Christ
493,coloradokid719,"Powerful, Intense, and Profound",10,29 February 2004,"I wouldn't call The Passion of the Christ a film. I would call it an experience, and one that can't be easily described. It will also be different for every individual that experiences it.Before I heard Mel Gibson talk about this film, I couldn't help thinking it was like watching a moving Caravaggio, so I was surprised to hear him say almost those exact words to describe the cinematographic quality of the film.It is fluid in its movement. I felt as though I was there, ""in the moment."" It also seemed to be not unlike a documentary.The performances in this film are spectacular. Although the dialogue is spoken in ""dead languages,"" one does not need to understand them, nor does one necessarily need to pay close attention to the subtitles, to understand what is occurring, or to know what each character is feeling. The most stellar example of this is Mary, portrayed by Maia Morgenstern. With a scant few lines, her performance is 90% visual, and profoundly executed.James Caviezel, as the Christ, simply blew me away. It takes no imagination to believe him as ""Him."" As Mr. Gibson so aptly stated, ""Jim 'became' Jesus."" He WAS Jesus. There is an undeniable truth in his portrayal.The Passion of the Christ is an in-your-face, no-holds-barred depiction of one of the most gruesome, inspiring, and loving acts in history. I know it strengthened my personal faith and conviction and made me reevaluate some of my own perceptions. I know it has changed lives already. No one can experience this film without being touched in some way. Some will find it has a deep, profound impact, and others will simply gain new perspectives.I've never before attended a film in a theatre and experienced a silent audience from start to finish. Every seat was filled, yet there was not a sound. A silent ovation, to Mr. Gibson, the cast, and crew of The Passion of the Christ!",The Passion of the Christ
494,redjackco,"A true film event, but...",6,30 March 2004,"There are two ways to assess this film. One is objectively as cinema; the other is subjectively as a religious and cultural event.As a film, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is only mediocre. It has a thin plot, no subplots, and virtually all the characterizations are uni-dimensional. For example, the two Marys are always grief stricken; the Roman centurians are all laughing, drunken, sadistic buffoons; the rabbis are all determined to get the blasphemer; and Jesus is perpetually suffering, except in the flashbacks in which we see a glimpse of someone who is other than a victim. Ironically, the only two characters that show some range are Pontius Pilate and his deputy, Abenader.The two bright points of the film as cinema are Caleb Deschanel's cinematography (if you discount the excessive use of slow motion) and Keith VanderLaan and his crew's marvelous make-up effects.Despite this, as an event it is well worth seeing. No doubt, many have come away from ""The Passion of the Christ"" truly moved and shaken. Others may have come away shocked at the graphic brutality.Inasmuch as I grew up with this story, I long ago came to grips emotionally with the series of events depicted in the film. Today I choose to view the legacy of Jesus as love, goodness, and sharing, and wish all of us in this world would practice what this man has taught us. Unfortunately, many who most loudly profess Christianity spend more time proselytizing and politicizing their beliefs than actually living the life exemplified by his teachings and acts.
So much for the Christian way....",The Passion of the Christ
495,AndytheDirector,A Critical View of Gibson's Passion (No Real Rating),5,2 January 2007,"We have just emerged from what we could call the Decade of Epics. Beginning in 1997, with George Lucas's re-issue of the original ""Star Wars"" films, Hollywood has churned out epic after epic every year, catering to every taste, whether it be classical fantasy (Lord of the Rings), children's fairytale (Narnia), or even monster movies (King Kong). Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" surely benefited from being conceived and released in this period (of course, Gibson laid the groundwork for a decade of epics with his ""Braveheart"" in 1995). Now that film audiences have begun to mellow a bit and begun watching smaller films, it is now more appropriate than before to appraise these films. Furthermore, given recent events, it is even more important for a viewer to re-evaluate ""The Passion of the Christ"".Mel Gibson experienced a spiritual conversion after years of being a Hollywood wild child and returned to his traditionalist Catholic roots, and initiated this film as an exercise that he said was ""good for the soul"". However, following revelations about his father's Holocaust denials and Gibson's own religious views, which allegedly reject Vatican II, a council that reformed and revised certain aspects of the Mass while changing views of Judeo-Catholic relations, the film came under fire. The Anti-Defamation League and other anti-discrimination groups contacted Gibson, trying to be sure that his film would not further anti-Semitism. Gibson rebutted with statements both against anti-Semitism and with statements from one of his actresses, Hungarian Maia Morgenstern, who is Jewish and whose father survived the Holocaust.The film was released to much fanfare and praise, while others said it was clearly anti-Semitic. While Gibson had said it was not meant to be that way, there are several reasons that have not been properly discussed which I feel show this film has two anti-Semtitic strains which greatly influence the film.1) SOURCE: Gibson did not use the Biblical accounts of the Passion as a primary source. Rather, several scenes were derived from the revelations of a stigmatic German nun, Anne Catherine Emmerich, who was put on the road to sainthood by Rome recently. While the nun's sanctity is not up for debate here, the authenticity of the accounts of her visions are. Recent academic findings have shown that the man who transcribed her visions while at her bedside may have in fact added his own personal views to the work which was later published, which could include several extremely anti-Semitic passages.2) CHARACTERIZATION: The history of drama in the post-Hellenistic world is tied to the history of Christianity. Many forms of popular entertainment were developed originally as forms of religious practice before expanding into the secular forums. This could include simple concepts of characterizing good and evil. Many early dramatizations of the Gospels were anti-Semitic, and it was in these forums that many ideas about how we view characters could have formed. Hence, while it may not be intentional on Gibson's part, his characterizations of the ""bad guys"" in the persona of the Sanhedrin and Herod do come across as anti-Semitic because modern dramatic audiences are used to character stereotypes that have anti-Semitic roots. For another example, think of vampires. While they are now viewed as nocturnal fantasy terrors, the origins of the vampire myth indeed lay in anti-Jewish propaganda from rural Europe that believed Jews would drink the blood of virgins and children at night.While these two factors I have cited are surely not the only ones which could be used as argument for or against anti-Semitism in Gibson's film, I only note them to stress my final point. Be an educated viewer. This is a film which can change lives, for good or bad. Following its release, whole theaters were booked by church groups to show the film. However, in Europe, there were also anti-Jewish riots. While this film can be used as a tool to teach an important theological doctrine shared by millions, it could also be used to shape and warp minds.",The Passion of the Christ
496,talasam12345,One of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.,10,10 June 2020,"For a long time i didn't see The Passion, because of bad review that say ""no story here,only gore"" or ""snuff movie"" and stuff. But maybe the main reason was because I was not ready for that titan of a movie, I didn't know if I can handle it and the message it delivers with it.Finally I did watch it at its full and gotta say .. this film is the most powerful film I have watched ever! For those of you that say the movie didn't have messages or story.. there are 10-15 flashbacks and all of them had a hidden ( or not so hidden) meaning and were full with story and love in them. The contrast between the flashbacks where Jesus is at his human side, living with the others, being a carpenter and eating dinner with His mom and the asbolutely terrifying scenes of His suffering is extraordinary.Yes it is extremely brutal and realistic in its brutality. Almost all of the movie is made to make you feel the pain of Jesus, to feel guilty of what we did to him with our sins. Incredibly realistic portrayal of the old days when He lived.The language, the settings, the music, the super realistic make up all combine to make the most intense portrayal of the torture that Jesus Christ went through.Mel Gibson is fenomenal, each of his movies are extraordinary and super interesting and absorbing. He is a genius, that's my opinion.Jim Caviezel is in the role of his life, literally sacrificing his body to portray The Passion, what an amazing actor!There were scenes where it is impossible to not cry or get teary-eyed. If this film doesn't invoke emotions out of you and you think this is just a snuff movie, there is something wrong with you in my book.The music at the end - The Ressurection is one of the most epic themes I ever heard. Perfectly done, brutally realistic, lots of blood and gore( not for the weak hearted UNDOUBTEDLY), and a very very emotion experience. That is The Passion of the Christ for me : )",The Passion of the Christ

I'm not a religious dude, but i'm a fan of movies and i'm openminded.The movie began good. A great mood was set. But whitin minutes i found out that i should have read the bible in order to completly understand the movie. The movie was filled with questions for me: Why did jesus get caught?From that moment on, the only thing a saw, was a man not willing to speak in ""court"". Not wanting to defend himself.Then, everybody hated him (well, almost) and he gets tortured for about 1 1/2 hour long. The bloody hero falls on the ground carrying his cross, get beaten get's up, falls again blablabla.When he dies, he speaks: please forgive them, they do not know.????????There was absolutly NO PASSION in this movie. It's just a guy getting tortured. ""oh look! he dies for us! he's the symbol for our religion because he feels sorry for the ones who kill him. isn't that great!?""No it isn't. I was not a religious man before watching.

498,Will_Scarlet,"You have to admit, it is remarkable...",5,2 March 2004,"After hearing this movie hyped since the summer, I was naturallyeager to see this film for myself and gather my own opinion. I wasworried after hearing one student at school say it was ""enough tomake any ki*e convert."" After seeing it, first, I will say, it is certainlynot anti-semitic. Gibson clearly goes out of his way to make thisclear. However, it can be expected, given his ultra-conservativeviews on religion, that he will take the Gospels literally. This filmdoes just that, and therein it fails to impress me. For me, the bestfilm portrayal of Jesus is Jesus Christ Superstar's Jesus, who isshown as naturally afraid, doubtful, and even angry at his destiny.Here, however, is another cardboard portrayal of him, prosletyzing,saying ""I am the way, no man gets to heaven but through me.""Besides this, Passion focuses too much on the violence. It iscertainly realistic, according to the times, so to show Jesus thisway is almost like saying he is no different from countless others.Though the violence works well at bringing out the sadness of thestory, after half an hour, it seems almost as if Gibson is forcing themessage down our throats. More importantly, Passion focuses toolittle on Jesus' teachings and peaceful messaging. It shows alittle, but this, and, in fact, much of the film's dialogue, is lost in asea of blood. I suppose you have to be religious to truly appreciatethis movie, and what it shows. But I think other movies aboutChrist, King of Kings, Greatest Story Ever Told, Last Temptation ofChrist, Messiah, all showed little violence, because it was notneeded. Jesus' suffering was supposed to have been symbolic,taking the entirety of mankind's sins onto himself. To reduce thesuffering to something physical and literal is to take away from thatmessage. Not to say this film is not well done. It beautifully showsthe relationship between Mary and her son, and has many movingscenes: Mary running to comfort Jesus, Simon carrying the cross,the denial of Peter, and many more. The languages give it anauthentic feel, as does the marvelous Jewish score. Even thecinematography is well done, though the slow-motion is a bit tooprevalent. Also excellent is Gibson's use of Satanic imagery,showing the Devil as a woman carrying a baby with an old man'sface. Judas' suicide, in which he is plagued by demons in the formof children, and the motíf of a lamb's carcass, with maggotsforming a grin, is well-done, but Judas, when he should be theopposite, is a minor character, and Peter, Mary Magdalene, andJohn are all lost as characters. The main credit goes to JamesCavaziel and Maia Morgenstern as Jesus and Mary, respectively,as actors. The main complaint about this movie is it brings nothingnew to the story of Jesus. To make a movie focusing largely on hispain, instead of the reasons why, and the people involved, is hardto do, and makes the film a bit too black-and-white for today'sstandards. The movie is really no different from other ""Christian""movies, excepting that it is more violent, which, most people wouldsay, is NOT a compliment. I suppose you could consider this a cultfilm, since it will likely appeal to extremely religious sorts who arenot too conservative over graphic violence. The theatre I went toowas packed with such types, many actually sobbing in manyscenes. Others, I was sad to see, brought their children (they'll betraumatized), hoping to ""bring a little of the Christian love to them.""Despite all of this, you can hardly help but leave this movie feelingimpressed, for this is still a remarkable experience, and a superbeffort from a great Hollywood talent.",The Passion of the Christ
499,Will_Scarlet,"You have to admit, it's remarkable...",5,1 March 2004,"After hearing the coming of this movie hyped almost as much as the secondcoming of Christ, and all of the controversy, I was eager to see it myself, if not just to gather my own opinion, especially after hearing one student at school say it was ""enough to make any K*ke convert. To start off, I can safely say, this movie is definately NOT anti-semitic. Mel Gibson certainly goes out of his way to avoid it. And the movie is certainly authentically Jewish. The marvelous score sounds beautifully ancient Hebrew, with traces of what would become the Jewish folk- dances of later, and the costumes perfectly capture the fashions of the time, while the language makes the story seem all the more real. James Caviezel and Maia Morgenstern give marvellous performances as Mary and Jesus, and theirscenes together are among the most moving I have ever seen. The use ofclassic Satanic imagery is also fascinating, seeing Judas tortured by his own demons, shown here as demonic children. But this movie is best rememberedfor its violence. Things like this probably did happen to a lot of people at the time, and Jesus' words make it moving, but after an hour of watching it, it seems like Gibson is forcing it down your throat. The film DOES proselytize, saying indirectly that Jesus' is the one true faith. At the end, the violence only seems overdone, and the rest of the cast has little to do apart from stand horrified at the sight of Jesus' torture. Other films on the subject, King of Kings, The Greatest Story Ever Told, The Messiah, etc, don't show the violence so graphically,because they don't need to. Jesus' suffering is supposed to be a more symbolic one, since he is taking all of man's sins onto himself at once. In this case, you wonder what the point of this movie is. I suppose you must be really religious to appreciate this movie, or understand your Bible, and thus be able to keepeverything else in your head, and in that sense, this is a cult movie. Manypeople at the theatre I saw this must have been (many started sobbing at points) and sadly, many parents will probably bring their kids (they'll be traumatized!) But Gibson shows very little of Jesus' teachings and messages, and focuses too much on the violence (and uses slow-mo too much). The main complaint aboutthis movie is that it brings nothing new to the story of Jesus, gives no new depth to his character. The only thing that makes it different from other ""Christian"" movies is that it's more violent, and most people would agree, that is defineatly NOT a compliment.",The Passion of the Christ
500,beckrbug,This movie did what eight years of religion class failed to do,10,12 October 2004,"I saw this movie the night it came out with my boyfriend. We are both Roman Catholic. My bf is more ""religious"" than I am, I'll admit, but after seeing this movie, I think I really understand and appreciate why I was Baptized and Confirmed. If you are Catholic or Christian or whatever you want to call your beliefs in Christ, do yourself a favor and see this movie. (Don't worry, it's far less gory on your home TV.) About three minutes into the movie until the bitter end and past the credits, my boyfriend and I held each other and cried. Mel Gibson, BRAVO. Who knew he had it in him? I thought he was just another rich movie star. Mel, if you read these YOUR MOVIE WAS AB SOUL UTELY BRILLIANT! I never really understood why my Mom wanted me to go to Church and why she cried and was so insulted when I told her two days before my Confirmation that I was having doubts. My Mom believed in something I could not grasp by the teachings of my Church alone. Maybe it's because we are so used to gore in today's society that I didn't really think twice that Jesus had to endure all these things. Maybe it's because no one takes the time to show and explain to kids just exactly what all those lashings would do to your flesh.(NOT over the top - I think this was a brilliant move with the lashings and the cattails - to show us the horror that words alone cannot portray.) Mel Gibson's portrayal of Jesus and those who loved him during these last few hours is breathtaking. His portrayal of Satan is also quite interesting. Why shouldn't it be played by a woman? Haven't YOU had any dealings with them? I myself am a woman and I thought that was a pretty good idea, along with the maggot. Excellent way of telling us who that was. This movie will make you a better Catholic/Christian/Whatever. It made me believe that even if the viewer doesn't think this man is the Messiah, He did suffer ever so much for a cause that HE believed in. That is enough for me: The fact that this Man believed that if He died on the cross that all humankind would be saved, and the fact that He carried this out, is amazing.You might think that He was just some nut, or probably didn't exist at all, but the fact of the matter is that this is a historically documented tale about someone who's belief was larger than life itself.

The movie very well covers pretty much what had happened during the last twelve hours of Jesus Christ. One thing I have to admit is the foreign language. Hebrew, Latin & Arabic are spoken throughout the film. Yet there is no English, none. And because of that the dialogue is subtitled in English. That is one of many things that makes this a terrific film. I went to the theaters in February 2004 to see this film. It was very very dramatic and sad. Even though I did not break put in tears during that film, I briefly blinked during the scene where Jesus (Caveisel) was being beaten. Every time they smacked him the camera would focus on it and I could not bear to see it. Despite this being a R-rated film it is only for sequences of graphic violence, and that's it. Lastly, I will just say that every time I watch this film or think about I feel different inside. I would most definitely recommend this film to anybody. This really is an Extrordinary film. I give my highest rating ""10"".",The Passion of the Christ
502,strumdatjag,5 out of 10 - From Secular Agnostic,5,2 March 2004,"I was particularly moved when the Minnesota Twins won the World Series. I am very devoted fan. However, that does not mean that I should give four stars to any movie about The Twins (Little Big League only gets 5 out of 10). Neither should one's devout, Christian faith instantly lead one to proclaim this movie as ""POWERFUL!"" There were many good things in this movie: great music and sound, wonderful costumes, stylish sets and color. Moreover, we finally have a biblical epic without that ubiquitous, obligatory narrator. The resurrection is portrayed in a stylish, subtle, inspiring manner. The use of the ancient languages helped to avoid any ""Jesus wouldn't have said it that way"" problem. However, no intense faith nor desire to ""evangelize the heathens"" should absolve Mel Gibson of the following venial, film-making sins. Mel has a lack of style and a tendency toward overstatement in most of the repetitious violence in this film. In contrast, the shower scene in Psycho is brutal, but we never see the knife rip the flesh. Saving Private Ryan was excessive, but at least Spielberg didn't show the same scene over and over again. However, how many times did we really have to see Jesus fall down with the cross in the same exact slow-motion way??? AND - maybe it is difficult to depict a sadistic torturer effectively (although Olivier did a pretty good job in Marathon Man). BUT Mel's tired technique is cartoonish. Mel's story is told with a whip, whip, bash then a cut to Roman soldiers with bad teeth in fits of maniacal laughter, then rinse (with blood) and repeat ad infinitum (that's street Latin). For those of you who didn't see any Anti-Semitism; there must have been a particularly long line while you were out getting popcorn. You must have missed the part of the story which portrayed Pilate as a leader who really wants to save Jesus, but is forced to give in to angry Jewish High Priests and their throng of bloodthirsty Christ-Killing Jews yelling ""Crucify Him"" in order to avoid a Jewish revolt. I am far from politically correct, but it's not hard to see how many would see some anti-semitism in that portrayal. Finally, where is the character development in this movie? Mother Mary is reduced to a woman crying (always with a single tear like those miracle statues) and chasing her son Jesus on his long march with his cross. This is not The Ten Commandments or Ben Hur, but it's better than The Bible or the Robe. At the 1:45 matinée, 4 people in the theater with me. 5 out of 10 or **",The Passion of the Christ

It's not the type of violence you see in horror films, but the most realistic of human suffering. As a person of faith, it is difficult to imagine anyone going through Jesus' ordeal. I was really surprised that this was a Mel Gibson project (however I did really enjoy Apocalypto). Jim Caviezel's performance was superb; I loved his portrayal of Jesus. You cannot get through this film without a box of Kleenex; I never can and that's why I have only seen it twice. It's definitely not a film for children and I wouldn't allow them to watch it until a more appropriate age because of the disturbing content. However, I highly recommend this film even if you are not into religious films; I think the story is compelling in it's self.",The Passion of the Christ
504,philipsavory,Perhaps the most important film of 2004,7,6 May 2004,"This is without doubt one of the most curious films i have ever seen. It has taken me several weeks to even formulate an opinion on this because it like nothing you can ever see or imagine, and for that Mel Gibson deserves praise. The Passion of the Christ generates emotions I have never felt before, I felt uncomfortably compelled by Christ's struggle and also I was frequently questioning whether I was actually enjoying it. I also felt detached because i'm not religious, so i'm basically soulless.To be honest I'm still undecided and as a 'film' I'm not sure how well The Passion works structurally, The flogging is an exceptional scene as is the crucifixion, yet the carrying of the cross seemed to drag on (no pun intended). Although it goes perfectly with the message Mel Gibson is conveying it doesn't make for entertaining cinema.The acting is impressive and the cast handle the burden of their roles well and claims of it being anti-semitic are not entirely unfounded but then different religions depict events in different ways so it is not a simple case of right or wrong.Overall The Passion of the Christ is an extremely important film because it divides opinion in a whole new way, whether you like this film or not depends entirely on your religious standpoint. It is not for the squeamish (It is extremely violent but it feels necessary) and you have to be 'ready' to see it but it is well worth a watch. ?/10",The Passion of the Christ

On those grounds, this film is unique and easily stands apart from all the other thousands of movies that portray the Crucifixion.Given that, it's a pity that Mel Gibson could not think beyond some Hollywood clichés when making his film (more so when he literally had all the creative license he could possibly have), marring ""The Passion of the Christ"" with some unnecessary visual clues and involuntary laughs in the middle of the carnage.",The Passion of the Christ
506,edgeoflight,A Cathartic Experience,10,26 March 2020,"Perhaps Gibson's life masterpiece, this film is captivating. It succeeds in transporting you through time and space and in having you relive the sufferings and last hours of Jesus.Everything works in that movie and I want to add I am in no way blinded by any faith when I describe the strengths of this movie.First, the atmosphere is matchless. Never has a film absorbed me so much into it. The camera work, costumes, music, sounds and editing is breath-taking. You would think the present has vanished and you are in 1st century Jerusalem. But the best aspect remains the use of dead tongues like Hebrew and Latin. What a feat! And that leads me to my next point.The acting is outstanding. It looks as if they are possessed by their role character and they speak their tongues so well they sound fluent in those. The emotions are conveyed with great effect but the pinnacle is the leading trio (Jesus and both Maria) whose emotions are pallatable and poignant. Even the Roman at the end conveys such emotion that I was out of breath. Overwhelming acting performances overall.Finally, as it is the story of the Christ's passion, some images can be dauntingly graphic and haunting. But Gibson wanted to faithfully depict the torment of the ""saviour of mankind"". He could not afford to go mild or the film would lose its purpose.To conclude, as an agnostic person (but does that matter) this movie made me feel so much emotion and I felt wholly part of Jesus's grueling passion all the way through the movie. Overall an intense, cathartic experience that pays great tribute to one of the most influential characters in Human history. And for that I am grateful to Gibson. 10/10",The Passion of the Christ

Good Friday will never be the same after seeing what Christ had to ordeal.Those who suggest there's anti-semitism are simply looking for negatives -- it was clear that there was disagreement amongst the high priests, and Gibson shows this, as well as among other Jews who were loyal to Christ, a Jew himself. The Romans are portrayed in a much more negative light.Wonderful job. One I'm sure we'll see as a regular part of our Lenten season going forward.",The Passion of the Christ

510,bretticus25,I will never look at a cross the same way...,10,26 February 2004,"This movie left me speechless.  I like to consider myself humane, and the brutality of the movie was too much for me to take emotionally.  That being said, Jesus was executed by the hands of the brutal Romans, and like it or not, that was what history has verified the crucifixion process to be like. The flogging was certainly horrifying.  One must wonder what made the Roman soldiers so gleeful about leaving such a bloodbath around the flogging post.I have read many comments on this film here before and after I saw the movie.  Taking Mel Gibson out of the picture, and besides the Satan and demon portrayals, you basically have a gospel account of what really happened.  It is not doubted that there was a man named Jesus who died by crucifixion.  I think that what this movie really does well, and should be done with all faiths, is to portray the the fundamental part of the faith. I have heard many people who are turned off to Christianity by the evangelicals, the imposters, hypocrisy, Southern-Gospel feel, ""churchy"" overtones, condemnation, guilt, etc. etc.  This film takes all of that out of the equation.  The viewer is set into history, with the language of the time being spoken.  The viewer sees this man, Jesus, condemned by his own people and the Roman judicial system for no really good reason.  I think that every person who views this film must come to a fundamental question of faith, and that is ""Is this the Son of God"".  This reduction of the Christian faith is necessary for humanity.  It allows me to look at Jesus and say ""Thank you..  You are my saviour"", or it allows me to look at Christ and say ""This was touching, but no thanks.  I don't accept your death as a sacrifice for my life.""  Like it or not, the beauty of it all is that there are no distractions that we see today to get in the way of that fundamental decision that all of us in humanity must make...Kudos to Mel Gibson, shunned by many for his efforts, and misunderstood by many.  Perhaps he is a tad eccentric, but the fruits of his efforts have really reaffirmed my faith in the loving Christ that I have.I trust that all offended people, faiths, athiests, etc. will give us a similar film that will help humanity find that which touches their souls.",The Passion of the Christ
511,tmills777,The Gripping of My Passion,10,5 March 2004,"Three things stand out in this movie for me. First, it was a masterpiece of ""Biblical Proportions.""  I had heard others' experiences when they watched the movie.  But three things piqued my fancy: Christ and his mother laughing over a table he had built; Malchus kneeling in total shock after his ear had been put back on by Christ [and then a one-second shot of him as the procession neared Golgatha, looking forlorn]; and the look Peter and Jesus shared as Peter denied Him for the third time. Christ and Mary...did Jesus laugh and joke with his family?  Undoubtedly, yes. I was glad this scene was inserted as it showed His humanity and compassion. Malchus...what a vision this actor left us, as he knelt in shock over what Jesus had just done and felt his ear back on his head and the pain gone. It was all so real! And the scene, oh so brief, of him later ... the look of sorrow on his face said it all.  What magnificent screenwriting and camera-work! And for me personally, the look of horror that overcame Peter as he saw his Lord, beaten and bleeding, look at him.  Yes, I knew that look from personal experience.  How many times have I denied Him, just as Peter did, through a word, or deed that I regretted...and stamped me as his enemy? That is the point in the movie that I ""lost it."" For the first time.",The Passion of the Christ
512,MacNessa,The seriousness of sacrifice,10,8 April 2004,"As I walked out of my local cineplex, having just watched this visual experience of the death of Christ, I found it very difficult to form a clear opinion of what I thought about the film. The acting and directing were of course excellent, but I really wanted to be moved. In one sense its hard to moved by a story that you have heard hundred of times before, and yet a day after seeing it, I have to admit that this was one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I think this is because we are forced to identify with certain aspects of the film. All of us can and should identify with the crowd who call for Him to be crucified or the Roman soldiers he beat Him to a pulp. Its what we do everyday. By extension, even if you dont believe, you must agree that so many of our actions, knowing or unknowing, hurt or impoverish our fellow man or harm the environment. As Jesus said to the Father, ""Forgive them, for they know not what they do"".For me the most moving parts were the interaction of Jesus and his mother Mary. To me it was she is watching her son being ripped to shreds in front of her. For a moment the good son, the loving mother and the Father who seems distant demanding the sacrifice form an interesting family dynamic. Lesser people would have failed, but Mary in the end understands that her sons sacrifice is necessary. As a final note, this film is not being that well received in western europe as it is in the US. The local intelligensia, who are now in control here in Spain, have been quite sneering, and have recommended people to go an see the Life of Brian or Almodovar's new film, The Bad Education, which I saw last week. How wrong! I have the Life of Brian on DVD and I intend destroying it. Making a joke about crucifiction is a sick joke. Not only Jesus, but millions of others died this terrible death, and finding this humorous is in my opinion offensive.",The Passion of the Christ

514,finnigan2,Unsettling experience,10,7 March 2004,"As a ""lapsed Christian"", I found this film thought provoking on many levels. It's a serious work that tries to make you face, up close and personal, the meaning of the crucifiction. It does this through a heavy emphasis on graphic gore and violence that is hard to watch but which achieves it's desired effect by making you realize the suffering that Christ went through and which Christians believe was necessary to ""redeem"" them. It's not hard to understand why many who are more used to Easter Bunny and Santa Claus depictions would find this sudden hard reality distasteful. Gibson forces us to face the truth and some can't handle the truth. Is it anti-Semitic? I don't think so. Although the chief rabbi and a few of his followers are shown to be actively seeking Christ's death, their all too human motives are made clear and we can understand their reasoning even if we don't condone it. I thought the movie was beautifully filmed and the most moving moment came near the end when Mary takes her son from the cross, kisses him on the cheek and, her mouth smeared with his blood looks up slowly and stares directly into the camera and at us, for what seems like an eternity. Her eyes are accusatory and she seems to be saying to all of us - you did this! All of you are responsible and guilty for this crime. A very unsettling experience. I think this film will spark a renewed interest in Christianity and perhaps even improve church attendance and, whether you agree with Mel's vision or not, how many movies can be said to have such an impact on peoples lives? Well worth seeing.",The Passion of the Christ

I know that we were very good educated and prepared for the future's challenges. And just because I am a neurobiologist and a human being, I find his film very good, because it's not a very pleasant job to show people the passion of Christ, a passion which has already begon in our own life: look at the world and you will see every second a passion done by evil.

516,A Jay,Not quite sure what to think,3,24 March 2004,"This is a very difficult film to comment on. Visually it is stunning. The pain and suffering of Jesus is graphically displayed throughout the film and the imagery will certainly have you wincing a few times during the whipping and eventual cruxifiction scene. However it won't be in the sort of grossed out way then a laugh afterwards to convince yourself that it isn't real. This isn't the sort of film where you can just laugh off the gory bit.Whether or not you believe it in a religious way or not, it is very disconcerting to think that a man called Jesus could have existed and that he was treated so mercilessly. Personally I don't think that Mel Gibson has gone out to just impress the audience, that's why it is difficult to say whether it is good or bad. It just tells a story, yet in a very thought provoking way. However if the hype of the gore and religion is taken away, the film really isn't that good. The pacing is slow and the repetitive use of the same kind of shot can be annoying. As a film in it's own right it is nothing special. The fact that there isn't a word of English spoken in the entire film is not actually a weird thing. I wasn't put off by the Aramaic and could easily follow the story. The performances were very believable and I was very moved by Maia Morgenstern as Mary. Rosalinda Celentano was also very disturbing as Satan. The visual of Satan as an almost inhuman yet still human being was very unsettling, she really suited the part. I've given it 3 because I can't call it good or bad, it's really something that has to been seen for anyone to make a sound judgement on it. Be warned though, it really does deserve it's 18 certificate, it can be quite gory it places and doesn't hold back on the suffering that Jesus goes through",The Passion of the Christ

The inhumanity of the Romans and Jews is hammered home far more than the love and goodness of the prophet they martyred.Why was this movie made?  The confirmed Christians who attended the movie with me were more appalled than exhilirated and said that they would not see it a second time.Technically, some of the film editing was clunky and sophomore-ish.

Passion of the Christ is just telling us how Jesus was executed and if that is all the passion was then I don't buy it. I know the execution was far more brutal than this but when I think passion I think what he was sent to do. His purpose was to save the sins of man but also to save man itself. Jesus healed the sick, raised the dead, helped the blind see, made the lame(crippled) walk and converted a prostitute into a righteous woman and that is the true passion of Christ. This is just another way to make money off of Jesus and I saw this as Jesus being more of a punk and less of a savior and I regret ever seeing this because of the fact that Christians in general are godly people and getting some to want the love of Jesus will never work with a portrayal like this. Show what Jesus really did in his life and people will understand the true passion. This is just a gut wrenching heart stopping (literally)gore fest that should have never been made.",The Passion of the Christ
519,bartverberne16,They should have called it The Killing of Christ,6,18 April 2004,"In my opinion, what this movie lacked, was the essence of Christ and christianity. And since the title is so promising, I was really disappointed when I walked out of the movie theater. The movie starts with the treason of Judas, which longs for about..., shall we say twenty minutes or so. The rest of the film, about a hundred minutes long, we see nothing but the horrible torture of this one man, happened to be called Jesus.Now I am not religious, I do respect it, but I don't believe or know anything about the bible. I roughly know something about christianity, from what I learned on school, but that's it. The point is, that without any knowledge of the bible this movie represents nothing more than the awful killing of this man happened to be called Jesus. What I mean is, there is no passion in this movie. At least not as promising as the title suggests. The only passion I registered was passion they had in shooting Jesus' awful fate. For example, I actually saw Jesus' ribs, exposed by the extreme beatings he had to endure. I'm not really interested in that, especially when I don't know anything about who this guy actually was and what his intentions were. Without any knowledge of the bible, this is more like a good (but sick!!) horrorpic. I simply don't understand why Gibson chose to make a movie like this. What I expected and even hoped for was a 3 hour movie in which the story of Jesus' life was told. A story that takes you into his life and along his eventual gruesome death. A story in which people can loose theirselves, something that tells you about the moving history of Jesus. That would've resulted in much more passion as I've seen now.Concluding, I gave this film 6 out of 10 grading. That's because maybe this movie is probably interesting for religious people, since they are more concerned with Jesus' life and the things he did. In addition, in the end, it was a nice horrorpic....",The Passion of the Christ
520,caroledelm,Magnificent!,8,25 February 2004,"We just got home, after seeing this film.  I'm exhausted!  Mel Gibson has outdone himself and most anybody else, with this effort.  His directing and the acting are excellent, and the actors fit their roles perfectly.  The scenes between Jesus and his Mother were most moving to me.  The settings are just as we all imagine them to be, I expect. The music is beautiful and sets the mood in every scene. Even the length of the film is good - only two hours. So often when there is great hype, the film doesn't live up to expectations.  We were well pleased.  For my husband and me, having read many reviews, along with the progress of this movie to the theaters, we thought we were prepared, but it was even bigger than anticipated.  I've read David Denby's (negative) review in The New Yorker magazine, and wonder what is wrong with him. To call The Passion anti-semitic is a mistake.  It was People and Religion who were the culprits (any Religion could have been involved). Everyone should see this.  And it seems that this is what is happening.

521,DietCoke13,This move is Gibson's interpretation,8,16 January 2011,"The brutality of Gibson's interpretation of Christ's final hours is well known to Christians, especially Catholics. I was raised Catholic, and the priests/nuns, etc. made sure we understood what happened during the last hours of Christ's life. The brutality in this movie is so overwhelming that I could hardly stand it, however, since Gibson is Catholic, I understand why he wrote it this way. I really had a problem with the opening scene, however. I have gone back and re-read the scriptures about Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, and no where does it say that Satan appeared to him at that time. I could have overlooked this, but what I cannot overlook was when Satan asks Him ""Who is your father?"" Satan knew perfectly well who He was and who His father was. The temptation in the desert, the 40 days/40 nights, is also well known to Christians, so for this line to be in the movie was completely unbelievable. In any event, the movie does pretty much accurately present Christ's terrible sorrow in the knowledge of what was about to happen to Him, of why it had to happen, and His acceptance of God's will. I disagree with the claims of anti-Semitism. Number one, He was put to death per God's will, and number two, the people who put him to death perceived Him as a threat and did not want to lose their power/authority/position etc. Overall, if you can stomach the brutality, this movie is definitely worth watching.",The Passion of the Christ
522,PennyIsMine,Not supported by scripture,4,20 April 2004,"I understand that Gibson wanted to demonstrate that Christ suffered for the sins of mankind, but isn't the Crucifixion enough to demonstrate this? The torture that Jesus suffers in this movie has two fatal flaws: 1) Nobody could have lived through the torture being inflicted on Jesus [who was clearly human at this particular point, not a mixture of human and divine]; 2) It isn't supported by scripture.Matthew and Mark speak of Jesus being hit on the head once with a reed. Luke and John speak of no such violence whatsoever.To give credit where it's due, the movie itself is beautifully shot, the cast is solid, wardrobes realistic. But that's all I can say.According to the Bible - which is the word of God for Christians, not the 14 Stations of the Cross (an invention of Catholics) - the torture depicted in this film did not occur.Shame on Mel Gibson for this work of fiction.But he isn't capable of realizing his mistake, and, sadly, neither are many moviegoers.",The Passion of the Christ

There is no attempt to frame the violence within a meaningful context - it seems to just be 110 minutes of violence for violence's sake, bookended at the beginning and end by five minutes of quiet.  I cannot imagine taking anyone under the age of 13 to this film and not scarring them for life. There are no redeeming qualities whatsoever within this movie.There are, no doubt, thousands of people that will disagree with my comments, and I ask them to consider this point - if this were the same film, but was not about the central figure of your religion, would you go see it?  Would you even want it to be released?  Would you feel comfortable letting your children see it?I think not.",The Passion of the Christ

In the end, this movie is about personal sacrifice..even when you doubt the reasons why God has you going through it..and God bringing you out on the other side.The line that was taken out is really only something a true Christian could interpret correctly. Everyone is a sinner and gets salvation by accepting Christ's sacrifice and making some of your own, including avoiding evil. And personally, anyone who stood around while Jesus was being tortured and murdered for the crime of preaching about God and the merits of a good deed is guilty of killing him.How can anyone see this movie, especially with Jesus asking his disciples to love their enemies most of all and beseeching God to forgive his persecutors (Jews and Romans alike), and think it was teaching you hate ANYONE?I kind of surprised myself because while I was teary, I didn't cry at all like I thought I would (and I cried 30 min straight after I saw Ben Hur...and the crucifixtion either wasn't graphic or shown at all, as I recall).The time spent watching this movie was very reflective for me and made me want to love and help others more than anything else...and the torture that Jesus suffered made me really internally sad for the state of the world.

There are several problems with this film. Obviously, millions of people know who Christ is, but I think it's important to give the viewer some idea of why we should care about this guy in the movie. There is no story! The occasional 10-second flashback is not enough to give anyone an idea of who this great man was. I think most of the Christians who watched this are missing the point that this is a movie! It's not like God came down and guided Mel Gibson's hand in making this. This is one guy's opinion, one guy's vision of what happened. And to tell you the truth, it's a pointless two hours of torture. This movie gives no picture of the wonderful things Christ did during his life. I think it would have been an outstanding movie, if they had first set it up with some scenes from earlier in his life, his ministry, his healing. Then, the viewer could truly be upset when they start torturing him. The only reason you're so moved is because you already know the story. The filmmakers didn't do their job. Don't get me wrong. It's not like I sat there and felt nothing, it's just that the whole thing made me really angry.

528,LA_Songs,ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES...,10,25 February 2004,"...So did I see it in ""The Passion of the Christ"" today.This is not a politically correct movie to please man, or to suite man's taste; therefore, there'll naturally be people vehemently against it. What did Jesus really go through and experience in His Passion?  The reality is: brutal, bloody, shameful and horrifying, exactly as we saw it in this stunning ""documentary"", or maybe worse, which Jesus willingly went through for the sins of yours and mine, according to the scriptures.  In fact, Mel Gibbson already toned down this movie's graphic depiction to keep it from slipping into X-rated class.  Historically, all the crucified in Roman times hang naked on the cross: the most shameful way to die; but Jesus endured such extreme shame, which he knew before it happened, and still kept his heart free from hatred.  Words fail to express such depth of love: because Jesus did it to fulfill His Father's will ""according to the scriptures.""Now that I have seen the movie today, I can honestly say that all that ""anti-semitic"" propaganda about this movie in the paper you read was some personal vendetta.  From this we can see how anti-Christian the media can be, spinning such a work of love into a work of bias, according to their wicked heart.James Caviezel did a marvelous job depicting the role of Jesus; so did everyone on the set. Mel Gibbson must have rehearsed them over and over to to get to right, and to truly show the humility of Jesus during His Passion. Not a moment did I see a trace of hatred in his face throughout the torture.  The director of ""The Passion"", Mel Gibbson, must truly have carried a very heavy heart throughout the making of this movie to produce such a coherent work of love from beginning to end.  Though he may not earn any award -- though he more than deserves one -- from man in this world for making it, what ultimately counts is how God view it in eternity, ""according to the scriptures.""Powerful movie: not to be entertained by, but to be reminded with. Go see it for yourself what happened 2000 years ago.  You'll never forget it once you see it.  Remember, what you see REALLY DID happen ""according to the scriptures.""",The Passion of the Christ
529,jew_59,Hard one to Call,8,28 February 2004,"The Passion of the Christ is a difficult film to properly critique. There are several reasons for this. The film depicts the life of Christ from the betrayal in the garden of Gethsemane to the crucifixion. Since only this portion of the story is told, there is little room for character development or story beyond these events. For example, there is little for any of the followers of Jesus to do other than wail or wring their hands at the torture of their rabbi.While the story faithfully shows the Stations of the cross, such as I remember from my parochial school days, and is well made; since the story of the Christ is more than this days events, much of his impact in the world and that of his followers is lost.What does have impact though is the level of realistic violence shown. Christ is shown beaten, tortured and humiliated. This part of the story every Christian knows from Sunday school or catechism classes, but this time no holds are barred. This film takes violence to a new level. It is brutal and unrelenting. While most audiences, by now, are used to seeing violence on the screen, this brutality is neither cartoonish, nor glorified.
Overall, this is a good movie and I recommend it. What is shown well is the vacillation of the Romans and the desire of the Sanhedrin to get this inconvenient man out of the way. Unfortunately, the time line of the film does not allow for deeper probing of these factors, no doubt leading to the film's controversy.If you don't have a strong stomach though, you might want to skip this one.",The Passion of the Christ
530,tpace,In My Humble Opinion.,7,17 May 2006,"I have called my review "" In My Humble Opinion"" for no other reason than I honestly do not intend to cause offence to anyone in the following review. I am an atheist, and also a movie lover. I came to this film with no pre conceived ideas at all. I was not looking for anything in particular as I believe you will in most cases find what you look for in life as in art.I respect entirely all people with religious convictions and sometimes even envy them. I think this film is a personal statement by Mel Gibson on his belief that Jesus died for him and other Christians. He felt compelled to try to give some insight into what Jesus went through as graphically as possible to drive home the sacrifice he willingly made. The violence in this film is almost relentless. And the lack of story is irrelevant if I am correct. As like an impressionist painter he has tried to capture a moment. It's light and its feeling. Emotion cannot be painted or portrayed any other way. Detail however can be and was not needed (We all know the Story).I think that there are two groups of Christians who will comment on this film people who look for Christ's life as inspiration will be disappointed. People who find purpose in his Death will not and will truly begin to understand the suffering he went through for you. I do not see this work as a entertainment, or even a documentary it's a statement, it's a canvas that has been filled with emotion, blood, and hope. Entertainment it is not. Art I honestly believe it is.",The Passion of the Christ
531,wainot,Puzzling and Troubling,3,18 June 2005,"The below is a slightly edited version of what I just posted on the message board: I was reluctant to see The Passion..., and just saw it a couple nights ago on DVD. In some ways, I wanted to wait till some of the controversy died down beforehand, so I could watch it with more of an open mind. Anyway, the reviews of this movie on this website - both pro and con -are generally very well-expressed, so, I'd like to put my opinion out there as well. One more preface to my comments: I was raised (and continue to practice) within the Jewish faith. I only point this out to show that my own religious education (through my own confirmation at about age 15) did not teach us about Jesus, the Crucifixion, the Passion, etc...So, I am certainly nothing of a Christological scholar, from a historical or religious standpoint. Also, in many ways, I don't ""get"" one of the central themes of Christianity, that Jesus died for our sins. That does not mean that I don't respect that this is an extremely powerful concept. In fact, I have great respect for anything that moves people (in any religion or philosophy) to act more thoughtfully, more humanely, more lovingly, etc...Just as I condemn anything used by any faith or philosophy that is used to show superiority, or to divide us, etc...Anyway, I am deeply troubled by Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, on a number of levels. To me, as a film, it was weak. Other than choreographing violence and hatred on a sickening level (perhaps, Gibson's intention), what else was recommendable about this movie? In fact, after the hundredth lash (usually delivered by a deliriously happy Roman ""sickie""), etc., where was there any emotional connection?Also, the flashback sequences, which could have been used to really tell Jesus' story, fell extremely flat for me. Were they effective for anybody else?One of my main objections to this film is that we are shown next to nothing about the greatness, and ultimate goodness, of Jesus. Let alone his brilliance, his special gifts, his charisma, etc. I know that this was about the last hours of his life (and what he went through) but there was almost no connection to the man himself. Again, the flashbacks provided me with little or no depth and connection to the larger story.Does this movie do any good service to anyone, except for, maybe, the Pontius Pilate fan club? Again, I am no scholar on this period of history, but I have read quite a few writings of many (from all faiths) who have leveled strong criticism against this version of the story. And, it just seems a little heavy-handed,, and fallacious, to present Pilate as a weak, though conscientious, statesman-like figure who was coerced into punishing (and then crucifying) Jesus by Caiphas and the angry Jewish mob.One of the main questions about this movie is, ""Is this film anti-semitic?"" I am not going to read/quote all about Gibson's personal views, nor those of his father. His viewpoints do, however, come out in his film. To me, most aspects about the storytelling in this film were muddled, and it was somewhat unclear- at the beginning of the film- into whose hands Judas was delivering Jesus. (Of course, it was to Caiphas, the high priest, and his Council). From shortly after that point, however, it is clear that Caiphas and the Jewish mob are shown to be powerful, unreasonable, unethical, and desperate to be rid of Jesus. Motivations? Who knows.It's just hard to believe that a group under the control of the Roman Empire would exert this much control. So, is this an anti-semitic portrayal? Of course, especially, if you consider that throughout the centuries, great violence to the Jewish community has often followed reenactments of the Passion. And, if Gibson were not making this point, why show the Jews in this horrible, two-dimensional light (and implying that they are responsible for all the violence that subsequently befalls Jesus), while showing Pilate as a thoughtful (but somewhat powerless) man. Even Herod was more of a curiosity, an ineffectual buffoon (as he may have been in reality - I don't know).Another question: Why was the Resurrection given almost no screen time. Why couldn't Christ's suffering be put into a greater context?Other questions: What positives did anyone get out of this story?In what ways was this film indicative of the Passion Plays that are reenacted? Does it square with how this is taught in religious schools, or churches?Again, the message, if there is one, that I take from this sickening and violent (and to many scholars, fanciful) film is one of hatred. And, that's a crying shame, to use a very old cliché, when you are making a movie about a man who represents goodness, greatness, love, and all good things.",The Passion of the Christ
532,FlorenceLawrence,Really brutal film,8,17 January 2007,"This film covers a very small period of the life of Jesus Christ Opening on the night when Jesus was arrested through to after the crucifixion, it is so brutal, that it is really hard to watch. It shows some of the time before this time line in flash backs of memory. A lot of the film is seeing Human beings form into horrible mobs that just seem to have no morals, heart or compassion. It's completely disgusting to think that so many people could take part in or even watch and allow something like this to happen to any other human being. Even if it was a criminal who had done terrible things, this would still not be acceptable. Because the hope would be that no human being, could have the stomach or ability to be so cruel. Technically the film does make the experience feel very real. Should something like this be made. If it could anyway reduce the cruelty that does happen in the world, then it would be a good thing.Crucifixion",The Passion of the Christ

2004
Dir: Mel Gibson
Runtime: 2hr 7mins
Rated: RSynopsis: Depicts the final twelve hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, on the day of his crucifixtion in Jerusalem.Now first and foremost I'm going to say state that I am not a religious person. I grew up Catholic so I've read some of the Bible and I've been told the stories more times than I can count. I get what was being done here and I get why this film was made. But it didn't have a significant impact on me like someone with a religious background would have. I strictly watched this as a film and a lover of film. I feel like the runtime of 2 hours is a little unnecessary although I get that they were attempting at making an epic of out this film. There are some scenes and parts that could have been completely cut out of this film and it still would have worked. There is literally the part where he carries the cross that easily takes up 25 mins which could have been shortened to a 15 mins segment.
Like I said before I get what is being depicted here and I understand the gravity of what they are portraying in this film. The actor Jim Caviezel as Jesus was a great pic. Although now looking back the only other film I think I've seen him in was ""Deja Vu"" with Denzel Washington which I love that film. The actress to portray Magdalen was intresting because I can only recall her from ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" and ""Shoot Em Up"". Just a very interesting pick to portray her. All of the acting is done incredibly well, the set design is amazing and it looks like a lot of time and effort was put into making. This film. The story is very self explanatory as to what is going on although they could have done a little better with explaining who some of the characters are considering you kind of have to figure it out on your own as they go along.
This one is short just because there really isn't a lot of dialogue in this film. The story is straight forward so there not twists or anything like that. Would recommend this for a religious person, I'm sure they would shed a tear or two if they can connect with this film on that level. I've seen it don't think I'll ever watch it again, couldn't have done a theater watch with it being so long and very dry in turn it's just two hours of Jesus being tortured. And I probably wouldn't own it. But as for set design and characters it's a beautifully made film and I have to give credit where it's due.

534,lamyabadar,Unforgettable,10,13 June 2019,"I wanted for long time to watch this movie but for some reason I just couldn't. It is exactly what I imagined it will be, I watched a lot of movies but no movie has changed me like The Passion of Christ did. Mel Gibson is no wonder hated by a group of people, he is one of the most talented directors in the history of Cinema. Give him a story and he will Give you a work of art a masterpiece
The movie tells the story that changed history forever, it dives into the deepest human emotions such as betrayal, patience, salvation, and injustice in the most powerful ways imagined
Either you believe in him or you don't, you can't deny the fact it happened and it changed everything
I salute the actors for learning to speak the beautiful language that is Aramaic, I understood almost everything due it's similarity between Arabic and Hebrew
I recommend this film to everyone with open mind and heart",The Passion of the Christ
535,refrankfurt,"All passion, no Christ",1,25 February 2006,"So much has already been written about this movie that it is improbable that I can say anything new about it. All the same, I am going to put in my two cents' worth.I begin by imagining myself to be a visitor from a distant galaxy. I have arrived on this planet only recently, and am naturally appalled by the violence and stupidity of its inhabitants. Then, somehow, I get drawn into a crowd of people, and wind up in a large, darkened enclosure, stuffed into an uncomfortable seat, watching this barbaric spectacle. First I see a man camping out with some friends. Then, suddenly, for reasons that are never clearly explained, the man is taken away by other men, who proceed to brutalize him in every conceivable way, and finally put him to death. Each hideous detail of this process is lingered over to the point of near absurdity. In the meantime, aside from a couple of very brief flashbacks, I am told nothing of who this man was supposed to be. After what seems like an eternity, I watch him expire. And finally I see him magically arise and walk away from the whole experience without a mark on him. I, in turn, arise and walk away from the whole experience without a mark on me. I have no clue who this man was, what he lived for, why he died, or that what I have just witnessed is anything more significant than yet another expression of the blood lust that seems to pervade this entire planet.So what is the point of this movie, then, aside from making Mel Gibson wealthier? To make believers feel guilty, and perhaps excite the morbid curiosity of others? Who was this man who was beaten to a bloody pulp and nailed to a cross? We are never really told. Of course, those of us who are not visitors from a distant galaxy are already supposed to know. But do we? Judging from the utterances of some so-called Christian leaders, and from films such as this, I am not so sure.",The Passion of the Christ
536,moabitnik,"""Torture Porn"" for the Fundamentalist Crowd",1,23 March 2008,"As everybody knows the story, let's cut to the chase: Gibson, in all his blind naiveté, has stripped the ""Passion of the Christ"" of any context whatsoever, so the movie doesn't really make much sense. Why does the film tell us this story, and this part of the story only? To wallow in a regular sea of blood, which Gibson happily - and, for the most part, in glorious slow motion - does? Or what? I don't have the slightest idea. Maybe he wanted to cater to splatter fans and Jesus freaks alike. Which seems to have worked, judging from the myriads of dumb sheep that literally flocked the theaters.""PoC"" is little more than a bundle of clichés, and the Jewish part of this world's population needn't worry - they're not the only ones being portrayed in a derogatory manner. Virtually everybody's a caricature here: the Romans are shown as slobbering, bloodthirsty brutes; the fringed and bearded Jews wag their staffs at every opportunity; all of the women are docile, silent and tearful most of the time; and even Jesus himself is so good and benign and endlessly heroic in his quiet suffering it makes you want to throw up. And not because of the pretty (and, courtesy of Caleb Deschanel, very prettily photographed) graphic violence, mind you. Which manages to shock for about two minutes; after that, watching Jim Caviezel in his latex bodysuit (which is clearly visible a couple of times), while he stumbles, falls and is bludgeoned to a pulp, becomes exceedingly and mind-numbingly boring.Unfortunately, the film offers little in the way of redeeming qualities. Except maybe for die-hard fans of schlock, as this must be the most absurd and overblown piece of big-bucks cinetrash ever since ""Showgirls"" hit the silver screens.In order to make this biblical fairy tale more ""authentic"", the film was shot in what its makers claim to be Aramaic and Latin - with heavy American, Russian and Italian accents. And if that weren't ridiculous enough, the tongue-twisting dialog gives the - mostly unknown - players such a hard time that most of them speak in a very unnatural, slow and clipped manner. To make sure his, er, ""message"" comes across, Gibson seems to have told his actors to go all the way, which is why virtually everybody (with the possible exception of Mr. Caviezel) is shamelessly hamming it up, so that a good part of the movie feels like it was made ca. 1917 - if in 1917 they'd had glorious Technicolor and CGI, that is. Unfortunately, the film is far from silent, though. Instead, a full-fledged orchestra plus choir gives a rousing performance of John Debney's permanently blaring and less-than-inspired score which sounds as if it was lifted straight from a cheesy 50s Bible epic. And when God quite literally shed a computer-generated tear in the end, I actually felt inclined to pray to the Good Heavens up above, because this piece of incredibly dull and reactionary religious propaganda was finally over.I don't know what Mr. Gibson had in mind when he set out to write, direct, produce and finance this grotesquely inept specimen of cinematic garbage - the Jesus flick to end all Jesus flicks? Well, what he made is basically a religiously tinged - and even more lame-brained - version of ""Hostel"". In other words, ""torture porn"" for the fundamentalist crowd. Now ain't that sumpin' to be proud of?",The Passion of the Christ
537,Myssi from McF,Hail to the King!,7,1 July 2004,"Two times in a row has Mel Gibson literally beat the &%""# out of audience with his spectacular one man hero stories. First time it was the Braveheart with great storytelling combining magnificent battle scenes spiced with quality love drama. Second time it's time to undress the gloves and show how great director Gibson really is in Passion of the Christ what is a living proof that nova day movie's can be made in an old fashion (art)way : Focusing to the beautiful pictures & effective soundtrack and put the dialogue way back behind. In the end the pictures are what make the movie.I think the plot is pretty familiar to the most of the viewers so enough of that. Bible is some form of art and Mel Gibson as some form of artist has made his own vision of the Bible. That's that.I was little a bit worried about movie when I heard that there will only little talking and it's all made in Hebrew. It's a tough challenge to make a movie work depending almost entirely to pictures and music. After I saw the movie my doubts were vanished. Passion of the Christ is truly a beautiful movie, a real piece of art in a good way. Filming is unbelievable, music fits perfectly and the story is so well written that you don't miss any English talking actors. Mel Gibson really pulls this out making very intimate and strong movie. What comes to the movie violent I have heard plenty of people saying that this movies is too violent. I have to admit that I have seen action movies a lot but this one must be on of the most sadistic and brutalism movie I have ever seen. Main character is SO badly beaten that I really feel sorry for the guy. But I think that was the whole idea of the movie. Gibson wanted to make the beating so real that the whip plashes are felt in the audience. Watching the movie really makes you thing that 'Stop beating that man, it's enough'!!' and that's the one part what makes this movie so good. It's personal and very touching. If you are very emotional person, prepare yourself before watching the movie.Have to admit that Gibson really knows how to direct a story to fluent movie. I salute Mr. Gibson to make a one of the best films ever. These kinds of movies are rare and should be part of the movie history.",The Passion of the Christ
538,kellyap7,Left me wanting more...,7,2 March 2004,"Overall a good movie, but I won't be buying a copy for my DVD collection. To be very brief, I'll just touch on a few things. 1) It covers a brief period of time, roughly a day in Jesus' life. As such, there is a lot of history and post-'mortem' which is left uncovered in the movie... Afterwards, I felt like I'd seen *part* of a movie, or read a single chapter of a book (gee, how punny...perhaps I should have typed 'Book'). 2) The events depicted are fairly uniform, mostly depicting deplorable acts of violence and / or torture.  As such, the actors are mainly limited to displays of horror, grimace, and cries of pain. The emotive ""range"" required of their acting is largely uncomplicated. 3) The movie is quite violent, and I had to look away a few times. Just the same, I think it is probably a fair representation of what would have happened in that setting and time period. 4) Even my untrained eye noticed a pile of cinematography glitches... Probably minor to most, but it bothers me when the camera pans back to a character and all of a sudden the cup which was in his hand is gone. 5) In the end, Mel was brilliant (inadvertently?) to contribute to this movie. He puts on a very respectably directed film, which has an incredible ""controversy factor"".  As a result, it gets tons of press, and tons of people attending.  Big dollars. But in the end, we just see another interpretation of a part of the Bible - and this one is fairly vanilla-flavoured.  All in all, worth cheap night, simply for the cinematography.",The Passion of the Christ
539,rykskelton,Non-entertaining,2,3 April 2004,"I walked out after an hour of this snore-fest.  The dialogue was a joke - it had even more lame questions in answer to questions than Matrix Reloaded had.  The suspense was certainly not suspenseful and the characters seemed quite unbelievable.  The King and his followers were depicted as hysterical drag queens and Pilate is a weak character that can't make a decision.  A movie that reduces my compassion for the suffering Christ went through is not a great movie in my book.  After hearing all of the hype, I thought this was going to be some amazing telling of Christ's last days.  Sorely disappointed.  I'm surprised Christians all over are making Mel ultra-rich over this uninspired retelling.",The Passion of the Christ
540,emccoy71,The Crucifixion in All of Its Brutality,10,5 March 2004,"To say that this movie is emotionally stimulating would be an understatement.  Christians can't help but be moved by the suffering of our Lord.  Many of us have read the Gospel accounts. However, to see it unfold before our eyes in such a realistic fashion is sobering.  How?  That the Lamb of God; sinless, holy and perfect would die such a brutal death for anyone.  Especially for anyone, like me, who is but a wretched sinner.  What manner of love is this?The movie, as in any movie, takes some dramatic license.  However, Mel Gibson's film does not water down the Gospel accounts to try to make the movie more ""appealing"".  It is clear, by the time you leave the movie, why Christ died and the love He has for all.May this movie convict many non-believers to evaluate the price paid by Christ for us all.  Hopefully, this movie causes many unbelievers to read and study the Bible and come to understand the Truth.  
For believers, may it awaken us to how the Son suffered so that we may be reconciled to the Father.  Perhaps to see what Christ has done for us will stir the Holy Spirit within to shine brightly to all.""Praise Him, through whom all blessings flow; Praise Him, ye creatures here below. Praise Him, above, ye heavenly hosts; Praise Him, Father, Son and Holy Ghost.""",The Passion of the Christ
541,Sternicus,Mel Gibbson's direction and attention to detail moderately saves a bad script.,7,19 September 2008,"That was the best title I could think up. Because lets face it you already know the whole story. Some people would say it was good because it showed us the full price of sin so that we wouldn't be ungrateful. Those who didn't like it would say that it was a macabre film with graphically violent images, and that it didn't really explain much about who Jesus was or his teachings (that is so true).First lets focus on what was good about it; 1. It allows Christians to sympathize with Pontius Pilot.2. The wardrobes looked authentic.3. The supernatural events involving demons gave it a nice touch.4. The casting was great it sure does beat all those other fantasy movies where the actors have a strange noble look on their face that doesn't change, if you've seen Eragon you know what I mean.5. The movie has a heightened sense of drama, there's more violence going on then just what's happening to Jesus.6. That scene where the man helping Jesus carry the cross starts to stand up for him when the Romans wouldn't stop brutalizing him was moving.7. It looks realistic.8. The scene where Jesus is comforting the other crucified man was moving.9. The scene where Satan get stranded in hell after Christ's sacrifice was good for empathizing the point.10. It showed that there were actually people who were against his execution, and they were crying for him when they saw what was done to him11. The scene where the temple is split in half looked effortless on God's behalf.Now lets focus on what was bad; 1. It doesn't really explain who he is so a stranger to the religion has no idea what's going on.2. It's not that the torture scenes were too raw it's that they are all what makes up the movie.3. The last thing you see before the credits is Jesus's butt... that's just wrong man.4. Mary Magnaline actually wasn't a prostitute.5. Jesus was not a ""pale face"".6. I remember seeing a movie a while back that showed Jesus that was more educational because it mainly focused on him as a teacher, and as a man who gave lots of speeches, in this film there aren't really any teaching scene's, or miracle scenes, which is what makes the story so ripe to begin with. Even an Athiest could at least understand the point.7. It didn't show him resurrecting. Shows him coming back to life, but not resurrecting.The film really was excruciating to watch and just when you want it to let up so that you can take a break it's not enough. You see him walking through town with the look of death on his face, and when their crucifying him the look of pain in his face when it tenses up showing his gums is painful to watch. It's basically the horror movie version of Jesus's life... by ""life"" I mean death. My advice, just watch it once.",The Passion of the Christ

Not everything is straight from the Bible, but I don't believe anything in the film contradicts the Bible.  I did not see the film as anti-Semitic; the Roman guards are viewed as much crueler than the Jewish leaders.  And, of course, Jesus, his mother and all of his friends and disciples are Jewish as well.This film is NOT for children but is masterfully done; an important film that will become a Good Friday tradition for millions of people when the film is available on DVD. 10/10 from me.",The Passion of the Christ
543,tahirjon6,"Good Movie, whether or not it's true.",10,29 August 2004,"SPOILERS LIE AHEAD.
Mel Gibsons The Passion is a good movie based on the best selling novel of the same name. The original book ""The Passion Of The Christ."" Is essentially a fictional novel based on certain gospels quotes about the last twelve hours of Christ's life. While the novel does not fabricate or re-edit any gospel quotes, it effectively omits certain ones, while simultaneously placing others in an out-of-sequence order to manipulate the story and thus embellish it without changing anything.
It is hard to compare this film to other movies, as there have been few that use this same style, however it can be said that the movies overall plot is rather hollow, (Christ is arrested, tortured, killed, and resseructed.) The acting is incredible, and it is safe to say Cavizel deserves an oscar nominaion. What really hit me hard about the movie is the unbelievable music. The music not only accentuates the movie, it makes the movie seem inspirational. The movie in all honesty is not inspirational or educational at all, it shows only christ's pain and (quite a bit of his) blood. It shows nothing of his teachings. To quote an episode of ""South Park"":  ""Lots of people were tortured and crucified in those times, it shouldn't be about Christ's suffering, it should be about his teachings.""The movie was good, whether it's fact or fiction, it'll kill two hours.

544,Win14Gipp,"Good, not great",7,12 April 2004,"(Warning, yon be spoilers) This is a film that delivers a tremendous build-up but very little of a climax. The film begins with the agony of the garden (""Let this chalice pass me by..."") and takes us through what Catholics call the Stations of the Cross -- the details of Jesus' arrest, condemnation, torture, crucifixion, and death. Beyond the line-for-line biblical passages, there are some intriguing touches. For example, Satan's temptation of Jesus in the garden works quite well, as does Jesus' ability to move flawlessly between Aramaic (when addressing his disciples) and Latin (when talking privately with Pilate, who rightly shows his surprise that a Jewish carpenter is fluent in the imperial tongue). And the detailed treatment of Jesus' agony is riveting, because it shows in unapologetic terms exactly how much he suffered even before he reached Calvary. It also bears mentioning that the anti-Semitic charges are a little off. After all, during the Sanhedrin trial, several members of the Jewish high council are shown objecting to the entire proceedings. Also, if the ""his blood be on us and on our children"" line is still in the film, it is left untranslated. (Besides, Pilate's symbolic washing of hands doesn't absolve him from his role, but that's another story...) Anyway, the film's main flaw is that, after getting such an in-depth portrayal of the suffering, death, and even burial of Jesus, we are treated to an entire ... 20 seconds or so on Jesus emerging from the tomb. The resurrection is the payoff for the two-hours-plus of suffering we have just witnessed, as well as the reason there are over a billion Christians today, and it is treated like a P.S., a coda. Mel did a good job with the story of Good Friday, but he could have given a much better portrayal of Christianity.",The Passion of the Christ
545,Kipper34,Powerful and overwhelming,10,23 March 2004,"I'll get this out of the way right now. There were scenes from this movie that I simply could not watch. I flinched during several scenes. I am one of those moviegoers that doesn't flinch for anything. I didn't really feel a connection to William Wallace when he was disemboweled, but I could not watch Jesus Christ being whipped and tortured like that. The most horrifying moment in the entire film is not the money show of the nails being driven through Jesus' palms, or even the dislocating of his shoulder while he's on the cross. No, the most horrifying moment in ""The Passion of the Christ"" occurs while Jesus is being scourged with a kind of mace/whip/claw weapon. The weapon lodges in his side, and the Roman soldier savagely rips open his side. I was this close to screaming at that moment. I think that the difference between this film and a film like ""Braveheart"", which is equally gory, is that the audience feels closer to Jesus than they do to someone like Wallace or Maximus. Many in the audience will no doubt have grown up hearing the story of Jesus every Sunday at Mass. I doubt any of them have EVER thought that the suffering of Jesus is anything like that which is depicted in Mel Gibson's masterpiece.I also don't think that many people thought Pilate would be cast in such a sympathetic light. After Jesus is beaten and whipped to a bloody pulp and is brought before the high priests again, I found myself wishing that they would just let him go. The film is not Anti-semitic, and I felt that the only possible instance of this is when Caiphas calls for Jesus to be crucified. Pilate's eyes go wide, and his expression basically states ""Are you out of your mind, you f*cking barbarian?"". This too was a powerful scene for me. Abenader is also played masterfully by Fabio Sartor. The audience is given a breath of fresh air through Pilate and Abenader. Here you have two Romans that, amid all the violence and brutality forced upon Jesus, have taken pity on him and do not really wish to see him dead. I mean, you see footsoldiers getting drunk, beating the crap out of a man who has committed no crime, whacking a crown of thorns into his skull, and then you have Abenader, who rescues Jesus twice during the film. This leads me to another point. It was Jews who killed Jesus. Not all Jewish people. But the leaders that swayed the crowd, that pressured Pilate, were Jewish. Remember, I am not an Anti-Semite. However, Jesus was no threat to the Romans. King Herod did not deem him a threat. (""Prove to me that I'm no fool. Walk across my swimming pool!"") If the Jewish leaders had not threatened Pilate with a revolt, or even brought Jesus before him in the first place, do you think the Romans would have gone to the garden and arrested him? No.There are those who will say that the violence is needless. That Gibson went to far. My response is this: It is a crucifixtion. The Romans were well-known for their ability to inflict ENORMOUS amounts of pain of their victims while still keeping them alive. Yes, the film is violent, but I think it needs to be to get its point across. Take, for example, ""Jesus of Nazareth"". Jesus is almost completely clean throughout the entire crucifixtion scene. It looses a lot of its impact if it is to P.C. or watered down to be taken seriously. I didn't think there was any part of the movie that seemed watered down. This had a profound impact on me as a person, and I pose this question to you: Are we really all that different now than 2000 years ago? Are we really so civilized that we are above pain and suffering like Jesus felt? Are we?10 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
546,ReggieSantori,You Have Got to be Kidding Me,1,1 April 2004,"With all the hype and protest over Gibson's THE PASSON OF THE CHRIST, I was prepared to enjoy this movie that had stirred so many. With everyone alternately attacking and celebrating the movie, it seemed it just had to be good. Well, I finally went and saw it.To my disappointment, I found that several of the negative things said of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST are true. The film is very self-indulgent, overblown, and offensive. I am not an easily offended viewer, nor an easily disgusted one. For a film that takes itself seriously, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST shows too much gory, bloody violence for too long. Mel Gibson's commitment to this version of the story results in long scenes of Jesus being tortured in graphic detail. These scenes are not only excessive, but slow. It's like William Wallace's torture in BRAVEHEART stretched out to two very long hours. The picture crawls gradually along, leaving a bloody trail.This same amount of blood and gore in a movie not about Jesus would likely have earned an NC-17.I'm sorry to say that the complaints about this film depicting Jews as savage cartoon villains are accurate. Even though Gibson may only have been trying to tell the story as it happened, the result looks very much like an anti-Jewish film. The Jews are shown mostly as a howling mob. The Romans don't come out of it looking too good either, but the evil of the Jewish characters really takes the prize here. D.W. Griffith could have made this movie in his time and gotten away with it, but today this kind of thing is a bit socially irresponsible. I'm no stickler for political correctness, but damn, do they make the Jews look bad!If you don't know the story, what follows may contain *SPOILERS*.The fact that the film has subtitles won't prove to be a problem for those who are annoyed by reading them because this film has very little dialogue. There is very little human interaction of any kind except for violence. THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST runs like so: Jesus is praying right after the last supper and Satan tries to tempt him (this actor did well, probably the most subtle thing in the whole movie). Jesus goes to wake his disciples and he is arrested in a slow-motion sequence with a lot of fighting. The Jews try to give Jesus to the Romans who don't want him, who give him to Herod who doesn't want him, and gives him back to the Romans who begrudgingly agree to ""chastise"" (torture) Jesus. Following long bloody torture, the Romans try to free Jesus, but the Jews would rather free the overly evil murderer, Barabus(they pulled out all the stops on this guy). Most of what follows is a patience testing portion, depicting Jesus carrying his cross up to the hilltop to be crucified. When he gets where he's going they crucify him and he slowly dies. He talks with the other crucified men and with his mother. He is stabbed in the side, raining blood into the wind. Then he dies.*END SPOILERS*There are brief flashbacks thrown in throughout this that are like a little taste of drama, but not enough to fill this film's void of it. It only delivers a portion of the story in which the viewer is nearly alienated from the characters. Jesus cries a lot and writhes in pain and falls down (while bearing the cross, maybe ten times), but we don't really get to know him at all as a character. The Roman commander is at least shown to be human (giving in to his love's sympathies for Christ and trying to resist the mob) but not quite three dimensional. THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is over-full with violence, suffering, gore, blood, and torture yet almost empty of human (or divine) drama.Judas is almost a footnote in this version. He betrays Jesus and is then tormented by cheesy horror movie effects and children. He hangs himself fairly early in the picture and that's it. He isn't treated as  character, but a hurtle the film must jump so it can proceed to the more important obstacle of showing as much blood as possible.Satan comes and goes from time to time, smirking and showing off an array of horror-movies effects. He remains a relieving, subtle island is a sea of excess until his final appearance.James Caviezel's performance as Jesus is convincing. Most if this performance consists of being whipped, falling down, and spurting blood, but it is convincing. The performances in the film are not the problem. I might have cast the film differently, but the actors here did do their jobs. The blame for THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST lies squarely with Gibson.If Mel Gibson wanted to bring something to the Jesus-film that had never been seen before, why did it have to be long blocks of torture? On top of this, the film is technically unimpressive and artistically unimaginative. There are no shots worth remembering or great feats of editing. The score is forgettable. The film's use of color is poor. Gibson really did nothing to save this! What he wanted is respectable, but how he went about getting it is not. Had there been more, longer flashbacks, had the violent scenes been trimmed a little, had there been more dialogue, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST would have been a good movie. It could also stand to lose some of the parts where the Jews are shown as a snarling mob of blood-thirsty monsters, and could have used better cinematography. As it is, the film falls short.I wanted to like this movie, but it's like watching a preview in slow motion: you get part of the story and only some of the good parts are shown. It can't be the whole movie! This just doesn't cut it. It's the combination of a gory nightmare horror flick and a truncated made-for-TV drama. For those who want to see a good Jesus movie and are open to varying interpretations, I recommend Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. For a good movie by Mel Gibson, look no further than BRAVEHEART. THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a movie to see perhaps just once, if you have a strong stomach, and aren't sensitive to anti-Semitism, and don't have to pay for it, and don't have anything better to do. Otherwise, watch my recommended films instead.",The Passion of the Christ

548,erwinoz,Very strange and unlikely story,2,3 September 2004,"This is a strange story. You see a man being betrayed by a friend and he ends up hanging on a cross, heading to a very painful death. The strange thing is that we learn that the man seems to be the son of some god and is meant to end up this way as a sort of sacrifice for the world. Why does this god want his son killed? I don't see what good the death of anyone would do to me or anyone else, leave alone the whole world. A very strange story, as I said and that's about all the movie is about. That, together with more torture, violence, hate, death and evil. The storyline is also very confusing. The god they believe in is supposed to be a loving and almighty god, but no sign of that is shown in the movie. Cause why doesn't the god use all his power to make all the hatred turn into love? The movie is made by a fanatic believer it seems. But I don't understand why he is so turned on by all that violence his god allows to exists and is even part of because of his plan to let his son get killed? I didn't like the movie because of it's overall very unlikely story and all the meaningless violence.",The Passion of the Christ
549,max_tony,You must own this,9,2 October 2008,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly, I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal, some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church, some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes, it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives.",The Passion of the Christ

Those who try to tag this film as ""anti-Semitic"" forget the fact that Jesus was born for the very purpose this film depicts - to die, to suffer (passion means to suffer for those who didn't know!) on the cross and to take away all our sin. I am not Catholic and there is much dogma in Catholicism, but Mr. Gibson definitely got this one right.The scouraging by the Romans and the shunning hatred by the Jewish Leaders is dead on. This film answers the question of who killed Christ - He did.If you're looking for Jeffrey Hunter and the King of Kings, you won't find it here. Crucifixion and scouraging were brutal events. Gibson's use of Satan is not out of line with what happened, even though not factual.This film is well shot and well acted.

I am commenting solely on the film The Passion Of The Christ. And it is boring.The torture scenes are far too long and gratuitously gory, bordering on voyeuristic sadism. A lot of the supporting actors are given nothing to do but stand around and cackle in melodramatic fashion. It resorts to stereotypes more often than it needs to - notice how the only ugly people in the movie are all ""bad guys"". And the plot, if it can be called that, is nothing but the titular character's bloody and painful torture and subsequent death.If it weren't the story of Jesus this film would be condemned from all quarters for its gratuitous gore and melodramatic wailing from the supporting cast.

552,darth_borehd,Generally bad on its own merits.,1,16 February 2006,"This movie is about a man who was persecuted and brutally punished for his religious and political beliefs. While the main character, Jesus Christ, obviously believes adamantly in his beliefs and which puts him at odds with the government and established religion of his time, his reasons for doing nothing to persuade others of the truth of his ideas, or even to dissuade them from punishing him, is a mystery. Several times during the film, we see the main character was given the opportunity to avoid punishment without admitting guilt or losing face, but he rejects them all and seems instead to seek out the brutality that is inflicted upon him. While it is sad to watch any human being punished simply for his beliefs, the Jesus character's strange behavior makes it hard to feel any sympathy towards him. The flashback scenes with his mother are the only times we began to feel any connection to the protagonist, but they are far too short and disconnected with the main plot to have much effect. I was left confused as to how this person came to believe the way he does so strongly. His beliefs are never fully explained so I was left with the impression that he was a deeply disturbed individual instead of a great religious crusader. The acting is passable but not great and the dialog seems like filler in between scenes of torture. While some parts of the movie had promise, particularly the cinematography, it falls short of its apparent goal of fostering an appreciation and understanding of why this man chose to endure the horrible tortures inflicted upon him. Only when viewed through a lens of preconceived notions about the character, such as a viewer's own religious beliefs about Jesus, could there be enough subtext to feel an emotional bond with the character and to have insight into his motivations. On its own merits, this movie is neither well made nor inspiring. 2 stars for cinematography only.",The Passion of the Christ

Mel Gibson is known to make utterly violent images ie. braveheart, but in this movie only one person is seen killed, Jesus. The substance of violence in this movie is fairly mild compared to Braveheart and people in no way should be compelled to view this movie thinking that it is explicitly terrifying. Overall it is a very good movie that depicts the last few hours of Christ. It does a good job of showing the pain Christ went through for our savior.

554,ptcommish,A Must See for any Christian,10,1 March 2004,"Don't get me wrong The Passion of the Christ is NOT an entertaining film. It is an important film.  A powerful film. An emotional film.And for Christians, it is a must-see film.With enough agony to fill five movies, the despair of Christ is there for all to see.  It is riveting and at the same time, unsettling.  It takes you a long time to shake it from your consciousness once you exit the theater.It brings what Christ did and endured from words to moving pictures.  It is no longer text in the bible, images on the church walls or a cross we wear around our neck.  It becomes real and tangible suffering.The words from the New Testament are transformed into living, breathing images.  It will touch more people in this visual society, than the scripture ever could hope to.   And as a Christian, it is important to see to have a better understanding of what you believe Christ went through for you.Would I recommend this movie to non-believers?  Maybe, maybe not.  It is well-directed and tight.  It is majestic and gorgeous and as a fan of cinema, you must applaud the effort.But it is also very heavy, very focused and very unnerving.  It takes you and wears you out with its brutality, and simply never lets up.  It provides little background information, so it is intended for those who are familiar with the story of Christ, and is not for those who lack that knowledge.  It is a very tough film to stomach and even believers may walk away dissatisfied.And the film is not flawless.  It shines brightest when it hearkens back to Jesus at earlier times, to give us more background and connection with the greatness of this character. Gibson should have shown more of this.  And the ending was a tad overdone in some ways, while falling short in the glory of the resurrection.  We endured this suffering - now give us more of the payoff of the risen lord.I am not a religious zealot.  I am a Catholic, who certainly believes in what I have been taught.  But it never hit home more than what I saw on the screen in the theater.  It made it much more real.  And I am a better Christian because of it.If this is what Gibson intended then he has accomplished it- and he should be commended for his `Passion'.Rating - 9.5/10",The Passion of the Christ

In fact, all the bad guys live.The message is of love, and that one should forgive one's enemies for their transgressions.By conventional film industry wisdom, the film should gross a few hundred thousand dollars and appeal to a very small segment of American society.Yet, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of The Christ"" is a bona-fide success.  Oh, to be sure, the media barrage and the critics piqued peoples' interest, but even without that, ""Passion"" would be a success on it's own two feet.  It's the most violent film I've ever seen.  I was in near tears when Jesus willingly suffered his wounds, but the violence is never gratuitous.And it's changing people.  It certainly did in my case.  I was one step above being a full- blown atheist, but thanks in large part to ""Passion,"" my spirituality is re-awakening.

It seems like one feeds the other. This is not a story about Jesus's teachings, nor his life, and it wasn't meant to be. It's the story of him sacrificing his life for the sins of man. There were many people who witnessed the event and lived to tell the tale. It is fact, whether you like it or not. It is horrid, because that's the way it was at the time. If it makes you feel uncomfortable, it should. This guy died so you can do whatever you want and have him take the blame for it. I know that many Jews are extremely upset that Caiphus was portrayed the way he was, and have made it their vendetta to get Mel Gibson at any cost. The NY Times published an article written by Frank Rich about Jew baiting BEFORE the film was released. The Hollywood elite have plagued Gibson ever since. I think that there is a lesson here for everyone, including Frank Rich and the secular Hollywood elitists, that forgiveness is the solution, not revenge.

This piece of garbage is not worthy of the attention it received. Gibson made an entire movie about Christ being tortured. It feels more like a horror movie than a biblical one. I am not a theologian, but I think the movie has some serious inaccuracies:1- In real life John was a 17 years old when Christ died, not the grown man depicted in the movie. 2- Barrabas was not a insane murderer the movie shows. He was a Zelot (a revolutionary group that wanted to free Judea from Roman rule). He was revolutionary and that's the reason the Jews choose him against Jesus. In fact, Judas Iscariots was also a Zealot and before being Christ's disciple, he was John the Baptist's. It's said that Judas betrayed Chirst because he thought Jesus came to the world to liberate the Jews. 3- Mary Magdalene and the adulterous woman (that Christ saved from being stoned) are not the same person. As far as I know, Mary was never condemned to be stoned. Lame movie: 3 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
558,callahan-patrick,Basically an enjoyable snuff film,6,30 June 2009,"Despite the fact that what describes a snuff film is an actual death of a person or persons captured on film; I think my caption suits ""The Passion"" very well (espically if Jim Caviezel is six feet under right now). For most of the film, Jesus is ruthlessly tortured in several graphic ways. As far as movies go though, this one entertained and satisfied me. Movies are, after all, made for one's enjoyment. As crazy as it sounds, the graphic torture scenes amused me. However, this did not excuse the lack of actual plot (even if it is based of the Bible in someways). Despite Mel Gibson's obvious religious lunacy, I respect the man. Braveheart, for one, is one of my all-time favorite films. Apocalypto and Lethal Weapon were also very good. People can look down upon Mr. Gibson, but most will have to admit that he is at least a good actor (and/or great director). Now, instead of rambling on about something unrelated to ""The Passion,"" I will identify the pros and cons (some I may have covered already)Pros 1. Definitely keeps you in your seat for the duration of the film 2. Possibly changes peoples' lives in a positive way. 3. Fantastic CinematographyCons 1. Mostly a WHOLE lot of gruesome torture 2. Very little plot 3. Maybe very offensive to certain religious groups.Once again, this is basically a snuff film. However, as false snuff films go, this is the best I've seen. Hostel two is one of the false ""snuffs"" that make me wish the director (in this case, Eli Roth) would just roll over and die.

Something I have never seen in more than 60 years of movie going.  No crackling papers, sloshing soft drinks, no cell phones and NO CONVERSATIONSThe fact that the dialogue was in Latin and Aramaic did NOT seem to bother this small town Texas audience.It WAS BLOODY, but not as bloody as the original event must have been - according to writers of the time crucifixions were extremely brutal and bloodily painful slow deaths - one writer mentions that in many cases death could take 2-3 DAYS. Nor as bloody as any ""Freddy"" or Tarantino movie and not one profanity or obscenity,This is a must see for adults, but far too intense for children.In spite of the howls from professional howlers, I did not find it particularly anti-semetic, nor even anti-Roman.  I was bothered though that the 2 thieves were so clean since a normal part of the crucifixion according to contemporary writers always involved flogging and other torture of the convict as a part of the procedure, and these guys were absolutely clean, looked almost freshly showered.One other problem, the woman playing Mary looked far too young for the part. Mary would have been in her middle to late 40s in a time when the life expectancy of most people was about 50 and she had lived in something less than luxury conditions in a part of the world that was (and is) long on disease and short on ease for the common people.But over all, a very well done film.",The Passion of the Christ
560,bondfan27,"No Matter What You've Heard, You Will Be Moved. * * * * (Out of Four)",10,28 February 2004,"In a time of film when the use of graphic or gory violence is used, it's usually unnecessary. Now comes a film which goes against that in all ways. The final hours of Jesus Christ were probably the most horrific for a human to endure and as a viewer, you will feel the same disturbances mentally, however not physically. 'The Passion Of The Christ' is a stunning, moving, and breathless movie. When viewing the film, the idea that Mel Gibson had directed and produced such a film had not crossed my mind. It didn't need to be. When films are supported by who's working on them or starring in them is ok because it aids the film, but when a movie is supported with no aid and able to move you is a greater accomplishment. This is the most recent film I know of that moved me to tears. The controversy surrounding the film is over-hyped; plain and simple: Don't listen to it. Is it graphic? Yes, but necessary. Is it anti-Semitic? No. In the times of Jesus we must realize that most of the world was ruled by the Romans. When people say the Jews killed Jesus is politically incorrect to target them as 'Jew'. The region in which Jesus was persecuted happened to have a majority of Jewish standing, with the Romans controlling them. The people were puppets to the Roman government and in doing so made decisions whether just or not to please the Romans. Aside from that the film stands on storyline only. Acting is a bonus and the cast is stunning (Since the film is spoken in all Latin and Aramaic it keeps the audience in a better feel for the time period). As for comparisons between other films based on the life of Christ, this is the most gritty. As for historically accurate, it's a little off as some characters are questioned to whether or not they were mentioned in the Bible. This shouldn't stop you from seeing such a realistic and powerhouse of a film.

What do you say to a film like this?Let's look at this film from the perspective of a simple moviegoer, with no religious background, no concept of who Jesus really is. The acting is flawless, the directing masterful, the gore convincing, the story heart-wrenching... this is truly a masterful film. One of the best I have ever seen.Now let's look at this film from the perspective of a Bible-believing Christian. There are some things in it that the Bible does not say happened, but it does not say that these things did not happen either.It is an amazing thing to sit there and watch the Romans tearing Jesus's back apart, and realize, ""This was my sin! I did this!"" It is amazing and convicting to see Jesus on the cross, crying, ""My God, why have you forsaken me?!"" and realize that your sin put him there. There were parts during this movie when I was sobbing and saying, ""God, I did this! Oh, God, my sin put him there!""Granted, it wasn't only my sin, but every time the hammer pounded, I cringed, realizing that my sin helped put the nails in those hands. And all through the movie, a song by a band called Jonah33 kept running through my head, especially one line, ""It was all for you. He bled and he died for you."" It was all for you.

562,brad12d3,A very well crafted memoir of the crucifixion.,10,27 February 2004,"It seems that people have given this film bad ratings because they didn't like all the violence. That's the only explanation I can come up with since I saw nothing wrong with any aspects of this film. It is a very realistic and haunting depiction of Christ's final hours. I was very impressed with the cast and crew who were apart of this film, and I believe that they really put everything they had into it. However, I think it is a little silly to consider the violence as downfall of the film, considering what it's purpose is. It seems that a lot of people have a hard time understanding Mel Gibson's motivation. I however have had no misunderstandings regarding what he has done or why he did it. The crucifixion is the center point of the Christian faith and the reason is that it shows just how deep God's love goes, and what he is willing to do for us. It takes someone deeply devoted to loving others to pray from someone's forgiveness after they have tortured and mocked you so extensively. Many have a hard time grasping the fact that it is possible to care for someone that much. That is what this film is about, and without the brutality this point couldn't be made. If I remember correctly there was some pretty disturbing images during Schindler's List but I would like to know who would want to confront Steven Spielberg and tell him that he is wrong for showing such brutal violence. These movies are made to shock you and make you cringe, so that we can thoroughly understand something of great significance that we couldn't be there to experience for ourselves. In closing, if you take into the account the purpose for which this film was made then you cannot deny that this is nothing short of a masterpiece.

This movie's purpose is to show what Christ did for us, but if U don't buy that world view, there is not much of a movie here. There are moments when it seems U may get a bit of a story, but it immediately returns to the beating and eventual execution of the Christ.

566,shieldspt,Brutal. Compelling. Thought-provoking.,10,28 February 2014,"Seemed like an appropriate film to watch once again over the Easter weekend. My 3rd viewing of the film now. It's naturally lost some of the impact of the very first viewing but still incredibly powerful. The brutality of the events still made me flinch and look-away on several occasions, though it was actually the events leading up to the more graphic scenes which made me well up a little.It is possible to watch through 'humanistic' eyes as simply a story of man's inhumanity to man; tyranny of the majority etc. Though obviously it has far more impact if viewed with some theological understanding and sympathy.The film does a superb job of accurately bringing the scriptures off the page - though obviously for the narrative gaps the Catholic influence is very evident. I think the portrayal of Satan and his subtle, sinister background appearances throughout give a really good portrayal of the fact that this wasn't just a Stansford Prison scenario but a real spiritual battle too. If nothing else then the film should at least be capable of dispelling the ""Jesus the meek & mild hippie"" image.Wonder what it would have been like to be in Jerusalem that day?Hope that familiarity never breeds contempt with this one.",The Passion of the Christ

568,ph0hunter,Lost Opportunity and Disappointment,5,7 April 2004,"In the past Mel Gibson has proved to be a good storyteller, whether as an actor or director.  With this movie he's created some stunning images at the beginning, used slow motion creatively to capture the tension in moments, and he cast the film masterfully.  However, this movie was a disappointment and perhaps a lost opportunity.SPOILER ALERT!  SPOILER ALERT!Mr. Gibson seems to have made the assumption that he didn't need to tell the story of Jesus of Nazareth.  All he needed to show was his arrest, beating, meetings with the Sanhedrin and the Romans, the mob, his scourging, walking up the hill and his public execution.  What were the reasons for his arrest? What did Jesus do that was so wrong?  What were the political and social contexts of the time?  It was not enough for Abbas to say to Pilate that Jesus had broken Temple laws.  Which laws?  How had he broken them?  The viewer needs to see these things for the story to be complete.  Mr. Gibson needed to provide a context in which the other people, both Jewish and Roman, behave in this movie.  He provides us with one-dimensional characters who are either all good and all bad, and it's uncertain which Jesus is. This type of extreme view fosters fundamentalism and exclusion. 
Mr. Gibson needed to develop his characters.  The story is incomplete without any kind of set-up which would give the viewer context and a chance to connect with Jesus.  I felt more empathy for Mary than for Jesus as a result.  She is really the main character of this story, the way that Mr. Gibson has presented it.  With Mary, it's clear that she's Jesus' mother and the viewer can connect with a mother's agony over seeing her child treated in that way.  I thought Pilate was far more human than Jesus.  And for Jesus, Mr. Gibson presents a Kafkaesque situation by not showing us what Jesus did to prompt his arrest and why.The black-robed figure that appears to be Satan also presents the opportunity to suggest that Jesus of Nazareth was delusional.  He is the only character to see this figure, to hear what it says.  At the beginning, we see Jesus in some sort of emotional or psychological turmoil that would also fit in with a mental breakdown.  As he's beaten and tortured, he would experience tremendous psychological trauma that would add to his delusional state.  The dialogue he has and the manner in which it's delivered also would suggest that he has mental problems.  I wonder if that's what Mr. Gibson wished to show.By explicitly showing the physical beating, scourging, etc., the viewer can see the inhumanity of certain people toward this one man.  Without reason, the way Mr. Gibson presents it.  The viewer can also see the psychological trauma through witnessing that Mary, Mary Magdalene and other friends of Jesus experienced.  It's also possible that viewers could suffer psychological trauma by watching these violent scenes, just as people who witness violence suffer it.  I admire Mr. Gibson for putting up his own money for something he believes in.  It is quite clear from this movie and various interviews that he's given that this project was deeply personal for him.  It is, in the end, a visual documentation of Mr. Gibson's personal religious beliefs about Jesus of Nazareth's death and truly for Mr. Gibson alone.  I hope that non-Christians do not see this movie as an accurate representation of the foundation of Christianity.  If they do, they'd see Christianity as a profoundly violent and inhuman religion.  And in this way, Mr. Gibson, with his highly visible public image and power in the film industry, lost an opportunity to promote knowledge and understanding of Christianity to non-Christians.  And again, in this way, the movie becomes highly exclusionary.  Without a story to illuminate Jesus' life, his beliefs and work, and without reasons for his arrest and public execution, the movie promotes a vision of a death without reason in the most violent of ways.",The Passion of the Christ
569,Bigbert,Who are all these people?,5,29 August 2004,"This is a very confusing movie. It starts off with a lot of bearded men acting like they just escaped from an insane asylum. One seems to act crazier than the others as he starts screaming to someone half hidden behind a wall. This is, as we later learn, Jesus and we leave him there for a moment as we now focus on another bearded man, Judas, who gets 30 coins from men in funny hats.The two bearded men then meet up and Jesus gets arrested. He is then paraded in front of everyone and it's sister through the city and everyone either is indifferent to him or wants him dead. One stop is to what seems to be a Roman, the other to a character escaped from Xena-Warrior Princess During all this time he barely utters a word. When he was paraded around the town long enough, he then just gets beaten the hell out of him, he gets crucified and that's about it.You never really get to know any of the characters and all these men with beards all look alike so in the beginning you don't really know who's who and what their role is. The beating is very bloody and will satisfy every sadist to the extreme.It is quite apparent that you need to know every single character in this, what their connection and role is as nothing is being revealed about this in any way. As far as good story telling goes this is a real flop but I gather this is only directed to Christians who know their Bible in and out, and I am not such a person.",The Passion of the Christ
570,JamisonC,I dare you to make a better version of the Passion.,10,26 February 2004,"This film will polarize viewers.  Those that know real love will see that this is what the story is about.  Those that don't may just be disgusted by it, but it's still a good step for them to take on the journey towards truth and freedom.Gibson has depicted the Passion mostly as I have always imagined it.  And this is the miracle of the gospels; they may not match verbatim, but then what would be the point?  My imagination doesn't match Gibson's scene for scene, but it's amazing that we see it almost the same way.  There is truth in the story!  We all have a unique perspective on life, we each have a version of the truth.  For good reason - but that's another story.Reviews of this film shouldn't focus on a critique of technique or acting, but I will mention that Caviezel's performance (and the film-making) brought heartbreakingly beautiful moments to life.  I saw the face of my Savior come over the face of Caviezel like a sunrise over the ocean.  There are scenes that I would have cut, like the shroud scene and the anti-christ baby scene, but they do not detract from the life changing power of the crucifixion/last supper scenes.I'm amazed that I can say ""watch the face of Jesus,"" because this is the most accurate interpretation I've seen of the beautiful face of our Savior.",The Passion of the Christ

If he made it to make us pause and reflect: he succeeded.In a sweeping piece of magically filmed history, Mel Gibson has shown me what is truly missing in today's movies: heart.The whole controversy that swirls over this picture is truly missing the point.  Jesus HAD to give his life for our sins.  The high priests were merely the tool to have it done.  The crowds were equally enamored, shouting cries of ""Crucify him"".  If it hadn't of been them, it would have been someone else, as it was as it had to be.One can only hope that others in Hollywood will take special notice of this film and strive to inject the same level of emotions and meaning into their own films.",The Passion of the Christ
572,godfather199,Excellent Film,10,13 March 2006,"OK. I never claimed to be a film critic. I think critics are warped, frustrated people with no talent. Since, they could never made a movie, they attack people who can. However, I want to finally give my input, on Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ.As the film started, I knew I was in for some fine directing and powerful images by Mr. Gibson. Remember, Braveheart??? If anyone is looking for a film about the entire life and ministry of Jesus, this is not the movie for you. I suggest King of Kings, a wonderful film made in 1961, if that's what you're out to see. Mr. Gibson's objective here, was to show the last 12 hours of Christ's life. And show it, he did. It's a powerful film, depicting the arrest, trial, and crucifixion of our Lord.The film begins in The Agony in the Garden. Shortly after, Christ is betrayed by Judas Escariot. The leaders, then turn him over to The Romans. The photography from the start, is incredible. The imagery used is quite imaginitave, such as Satan showing up, periodically throughout the film.People have complained about the film being shot in Aramaic, Hebrew, and Latin. They've also complained of not wanting to read subtitles. I feel, part of the film's appeal, is that in was done in the language of the time. A stroke of genius, on Mel Gibson's part. He wanted to do everything possible, to make you feel like you were there, witnessing the events.People not famliar with scripture, especially that of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, may have trouble understanding some of what is going on in certain scenes. However, I know of certain people, that got it all. But knowing the life of Jesus, comes in very handy, as there are several short flashbacks to important moments in Christ's life. Such as The Last Supper, The Sermon on the Mount, etc.I'm a Catholic. But I know of some Prodestants, Baptists, Lutherans, and more, have chosen in a way, not to think about the passion and death. Often I see their way to choose just a cross as a symbol of the resurrection. But, as a Catholic, I want more. I want to know why, how, when, and what it was like. Mr. Gibson achieves just that.Mr. Gibson, a devout Catholic, pulled no punches during the crucifixion scene. I can honestly say, it's the most graphic violence I have ever seen in a film. As the viewer, you feel the beating, the whips, the thorns, and the spikes. You FEEL the heart breaking of our blessed mother. In my opinion, Gibson did what he wanted...Make you feel it. So, we as Christians, know exactly why that cross hangs in our homes. If this film doesn't make a non practicing Christian, get back to Church, nothing will. As for the anti-semetic controversy, there is none. People need to get over it.As I said earlier, the cinematography, script, acting, and music are all superb. I found the film to be a treasure. One that will go down in the books. I hope people that have never seen it, will give it a try, especially with Easter coming up. Give it a chance.-VM ""Forgive them Father, they know not what they do."" - Jesus",The Passion of the Christ
573,uckpshh,Brutal yet somehow beautiful.,10,1 July 2005,"I don't know how Mel Gibson did it, but somehow in this two hour gore fest one can find beauty in this film. Everyone is cast perfectly, and you believe every moment, you feel every lash. This is one of the most powerful, boldest movies ever made. The suffering Christ went through was nothing light, as portrayed in other movies about Jesus, and from the title of the movie you should have guessed exactly what it's supposed to be about. If it is indeed about suffering and pain, well then it better look real, it better be violent. The cinematography is excellent, acting is excellent, direction, sets, costumes, makeup, all of them were top of the line. The only thing about this movie is due to its graphic nature, it will never become a classic, but everyone will remember the controversy surrounding it if the movie is mentioned. Anyone who buys the DVD is sick, this isn't something you want to watch more than once.",The Passion of the Christ
574,jriddle73,"Thoughts on ""The Passion""",1,30 December 2004,"This is a bad movie. Not just run-of-the-mill bad, either--we're talking suck-fest of epic proportions.The performances are almost universally awful, and not at all disguised by the director's insistence on using archaic period languages. Star Jim Caviezel (sp?) is particularly bad, playing Jesus as a near-comatose idiot (who refuses to say much of anything in his own defense) through nearly the entirety of the film. The other reviewers' comments about the ""superb"" quality of the acting are... amusing.The movie really is, as several reviewers complained on its initial release, plot less. We're merely invited to sit and gawk at a guy being tortured and murdered in drawn out fashion. In a sense, ""The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre"" moniker hung on the film by one of its more irreverent critics was entirely appropriate. The much-touted violence is there, but it's so over-the-top that it becomes cartoonish and even, as one reviewer noted, boring. The scourging of Jesus is a violent scene, but as we're seeing flesh beginning to be ripped from his body, it begins to get ridiculous. The beating goes off camera and gets *really* ridiculous, going on and on, enough to have killed anyone dozens of times over. When we cut back to the beating, Jesus isn't even remotely injured as badly as such a beating would have left him. Movies abuse our willingness to suspend disbelief all the time, and this would have been a relatively small thing if the movie had anything else going on, but it doesn't. The rest is just more of the same, and I'd already gone past my tolerance point by the beating. As Jesus is made to haul his cross through town, Gibson throws in a scene of Jesus, weakened and being driven by the lash, collapsing, shot in slow motion so as to make it what hack directors think of as ""more dramatic."" Then, it happens again. Then it happens again, and by the third time, I started laughing at the idiocy of it. By the, yes, fourth recurrence, I was beginning to get hysterical, visions of Monty Python flashing through my head (""The Black Knight always triumphs!""), and it wasn't even close to over--we get a variation on the same scene no less than 8 times, by my count. And they haven't even nailed him up yet.One of the things that genuinely surprised me about the movie was that the anti-Semitism turned out to be far, far worse than even the harshest critics had alleged. The Jews in this movie are portrayed as mindless sadists thirsting for blood, led by Caiphas, who is Evil Incarnate; a guy who makes Darth Vader look like a p**sy. Pilate, bizarrely enough, is the hero of the film, if it can be said to have one. He comes to Jesus' defense over and over again, and only consents to allow him to be killed after exhausting every other means at his disposal to placate the Jews, and, more importantly, after being threatened with an open rebellion. A pair of Roman soldiers are shown as ruthless sadists, but the movie makes clear their actions are frowned upon by their superiors. Pilate's lieutenant is shown as sympathetic to Jesus throughout--he yells at his sadistic underlings over the beating they deliver, and, later, seeing Jesus exhausted during one of those ""falling down in slow motion"" scenes, orders them to help him along. His frequent looks of disgust are quite a contrast with Caiphas' smug sadism, taunting Jesus even as he's nailed up. Overall, I think the anti-Semitism angle was actually grossly underplayed by the film's critics.Bottom line: I'm disturbed by this film. Not by the movie itself, which, as I've said, is a ridiculous cartoon. What bothers me is the reaction to the movie by a not inconsequential contingent of my fellow citizens. After my laughing spell while watching it, I started turning over, in my head, the reception the movie has had. A huge money-maker. A cadre of devoted fans. A friend told me it sold by the truckload when it hit the video market. What are these people seeing when they watch the movie? There's virtually nothing of any of the philosophy of Jesus which Christians insist, when trying to recruit, is so wonderful. It's just a lengthy torture/murder staged as a spectacle. What have people really seen in this movie that makes them so devoted to it? I find myself thinking very bleak thoughts about what must be going on in their minds. I feel as though I'm seeing a manifestation of some ugly little corner of their soul, one I've never noticed, and one I don't like the looks of.",The Passion of the Christ
575,ninetyninedegrees,I just don't get it,1,8 February 2005,"My not being Christian probably affects my judgment on this movie (I was raised Protestant, but have been Agnostic since age 9). I rented it, expecting not to enjoy it, but wanted to know ""what all the fuss was about"". I still don't know what all the hype was about. This movie was dreadful. Just footage after footage of the brutality. I suffered though all of that, hoping to see a point. When the movie finally ended I was practically shouting That's IT! That's the ending? What was the point? And people are supposed to get inspiration from seeing a man brutalized? Jesus certainly was not the only person ever to suffer. The Spanish Catholics did a pretty good job of brutalizing Jews and Muslims in The Inquisition. Would Christians get inspiration from watching a non-Christian torn apart limb by limb on the rack? I doubt it. Mel Gibson seems to have a thing for portraying unnecessary brutality in film, such as in Braveheart. I see no need or point to it.",The Passion of the Christ
576,tramky,The Torture of the Christ,4,29 May 2005,"In a nutshell, my view of 'The Passion' is perhaps quite cynical. And also understand that I can take all the blood & gore that Hollywood can dish out. But it comes to this: Mel Gibson learned from the concluding scenes of 'Braveheart' that depicting elaborate physical torture can have a certain repulsive yet appealing effect on audiences. So why not make an entire feature-length film depicting torture rather than limiting it to a few scenes such as those devoted to the hanging, drawing and quartering of the Scottish rebel William Wallace, the title character of 'Braveheart'.And so we get to watch the graphic, bloody torture and humiliation of perhaps the most famous figure in Western culture--no less than Jesus Christ himself. And this is the ONLY character/person whose torture as depicted in this way could be accepted. I'm sure that Gibson could not get anyone to back a film which depicted, in full graphic detail, the treatment of anonymous Chinese prisoners by the Japanese army during World War II. Though who knows? . . . perhaps ""The Passion"" will set the cultural tolerance level quite a bit higher so that we will accept ever more graphic depictions of the nasty things that people do to each other.And it is, in my view, quite telling of the evangelical Christian movement in the United States that their churches are making field trips to watch this film while they castigated and vilified Martin Scorsese's most affecting ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", a depiction of Christ's last days which I found MUCH more uplifting and spiritual than Gibson's bloodbath in 'The Passion'.There is nothing in this depiction of the Crucifixion which would cause ME to want to become a Christian or a born-again Christian, and I would be very, very concerned about and for people who claim to have found Christ because of this film. But that is social criticism, not film commentary.Did Gibson succeed in bringing forth a literal depiction of how Christ's last days were described in The Gospels? Perhaps. Who cares? The importance of Christ as the central figure in a major global religion lies NOT in his physical torture, humiliation & crucifixion, but in his ascendance beyond death at the hands of God and what that was to mean for mankind and the world. I don't need the blood and gore to understand the light in which we should view Christ as Savior, and it doesn't elevate his position as a historic religious figure.""The Passion"" is a well-made movie with a compelling central character. While its enormous success is understandable given American culture as it has been for quite a long time, its focus on the physical rather than the spiritual does NOT help me understand either the man or Christianity as a religion any better. For that it will take something much more difficult to depict: God him/her/itself. When on the cross and Jesus says ""Father, into your hands I commend my spirit"", we will get closer to understanding Christ AND that spirituality when a motion picture depicts who or what, exactly, he is speaking to.",The Passion of the Christ
577,NetflixZZZZ,The most sadistic yet imposing film to date!,3,4 June 2009,"Some famous psychiatrists say: Human is a spiritual being.

Nevertheless his portrayal of Jews is deeply troubling. And his sympathetic portryal of Pilate is based on one line in the Bible. Pilate is the only figure in this time who is mentioned in sources other than the Bible. The Roman government recalled him because he was corupt and too brutal. Too Brutal! And this is Rome, the government which had people torn aprt by lions for public amusement. And Gibson portrays him as a sympathetic character?

Of course not, because it is a lessen that we must learn and use to make this world better.I did not enjoy 'The Passion of the Christ'. Enjoy is not the right word.

As someone else said in a comment, it's about a guy getting his ass kicked for two hours.  I have no idea why he's getting his ass kicked, so why should I feel for him?This movie would have been so much better served had it been about the teachings of Jesus and his story - why he angered the powers that be so much, and then have his punishment in the end - now THAT would have been a movie.

Thus I guess that I was more than prepared for the gore and brutality.  With that in mind, I don't think that it was any worse than say, the opening to ""Saving Private Ryan"". Perhaps not even as bad short term but the film does assail your emotions for most of it's 2 hrs.  I was pleasantly surprised on the creation of the movie.  The directing, acting, and many other aspects of the movie were superb! It is a visually beautiful and has a very realistic feel time-wise.  The story line was taken directly from the Gospels... well, most of it... There were a couple of issues I had, but I was satisfied with 98% of the movie.  All in all, it was really awesome.The actor who portrayed Jesus (Jim Caviezel) was perfect for the part and well done but is more physical role than anything. I felt that Maia Morgenstern as Mother Mary really stole the show, she was incredible. It did have some scary scenes, some graphic violent scenes, some heartwarming scenes, and some scenes that will make you want to jump in the screen to help him. Throughout the movie I jumped in my seat from the scary parts and the graphic violence.   I also enjoyed the movie being in a different language with subtitles.  It seemed more authentic.  Going in, I was afraid that I would not like the insertion of the actor who played Satan drifting in and out of the film.  I thought it was extremely well done.  I felt the same way about the flashbacks used to tell Jesus story.When the movie was over, most everyone just sit there.  How I felt about the movie?  Well, I felt as if I was leaving a funeral of a close friend... at the grave site.  I didn't want to leave, but I didn't want to stay. Kind of emotionally drained.  Many people were hugging each other and crying.  I sincerely hope that most everyone sees the film and draws their own conclusions about it.

585,Robin_Hood,Incredible.,10,1 April 2004,"The Passion of the ChristMel Gibson's biblical epic has been swamped with controversy.  With accusations over anti-Semitism, the questioning of its theology and even an inquiry into the necessity of its visual violence, undoubtedly, it has been a popular topic of conversation, for both Christians and non-Christians alike, regardless of the message it carries.  So much so, that after I had seen it, I completely ignored the first person that asked me the obvious question, `What do you think?'However, one statement, which has been echoed by many columnists and critics all over the world, is that this is a film, which is like no other.  From the opening scene in the garden of Gethsemane until the final moments of Christ leaving an empty tomb, the film brings to life the greatest story ever told, which, sadly, has been seemingly forgotten, or rejected, in a rapidly advancing visual age.  Gibson captivates the period, the people and the punishment greater than any of his predecessors.  It is a phenomenal achievement.This is not, and I repeat, not something, which should replace the Word of God.  It is simply one man's interpretation of His Word, trying to aid a visual society to connect to an invisible, yet awesome, loving, God.  The certificate is 18 and should be stuck two as a) it would illegal not to and b) as I have already mentioned, it is gruesome.Time and again, whilst I watched the film, I felt the urge to comfort those who sat around me weeping, saying, `It's ok, it's only a film'but it's not. They are actors; the violence itself is an act, yet the story remains true. What is witnessed on screen is not merely a fairytale or myth.  Yet, for the sake of censorship, it is not as it was'.Isaiah 52 v 14 tells us that Jesus was beaten beyond recognition.  Had this been the case, the film would never have made general release (although you have to wonder with today's standards).  However, I believe, it is as close to the truth as we may ever get.  Jesus is not portrayed in blonde-haired and blue-eyed light; He is not seen as some kind of superhero  muscular and bound in a cape and tights; He is not the slightly zombie-eyed and dazed man we see in Zeffirelli's `Jesus of Nazareth'.  He truly is depicted as a man with `no beauty or majesty to attract us to Him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire Him' (Isaiah 53 v 2).  The character of Jesus within the film is finely balanced between the ordinary carpenter and the Messiah, making it marvellously real.The only very slight downfall is the fact that Mary can see Satan.  From my point of view, as a Christian, this would not be possible.  Other than that, there is little else, if not nothing, for me to complain about.The film is incredible.  Powerful, moving, upsetting and true, it is, for me, the closest I have ever come to the real thing. 9.5/10.",The Passion of the Christ

Yes the blood and gore is there and I'm not aware of a previous film on this subject that had as much blood as this one. But the plot is nothing new. People shouting from the roof tops that this film is brilliant or that this film should be banned for anti-semitism, both groups of people need to calm down.The story told is one of two or three versions of the story of Christ, the big question is who WAS responsible for Jesus' arrest and death? Well I'm no religious scholar but I've always thought that it was either the Romans, OR it was the Jews, OR it was Jesus himself. The truth of it is that it was probably a combination of all three. But to my knowledge no-one really knows the truth.  The version given in the film is a combination of all three, however, the Jews are given the largest slice of the ""responsibility cake"".There have been good films on this subject allready released, one of my favourites is ""The last temptation of christ"".  People only seem to think 'Passion' is brilliant because there is loads of blood so that somehow makes the film brilliant.The Language of the film was good, but, the western european/ACtors that were used were not good, I didn't realise Jesus was white/european appearance, blue eyed had perfect white teeth that any american dentist would be proud of.  What is the point of trying to be realistic in language but not in looks?  The cast of 'Passion' are all italians (fine for the romans) or Romanian/Bulgarian.

But what I find baffling is that a majority (I didn't count them)of reviewers, many of them Christians I assume were shocked or disillusioned by what they saw, i.e. the brutality. But then Jesus's life was filled with his message, regardless of His suffering at the hands of the Romans (not the Jews).Being a Christian himself I believe Mel Gibson wanted to create a historical document using a media that technologically represents our times, while letting viewers know what Jesus's life and what he endured. It would not surprise me if many of those who are disappointed by the film are devout Christians.There is a reason Jesus is worshipped and is God's begotten son. If such viewers believe this then why is it that they don't have the stomach for the starkly brutal reality that was His life. This is not a portrayal of sadism as some reviewers said.The language spoken in the film i.e. Aramaic in my opinion only serves to confirm that Mel Gibson's work is a work of historical/religious art. And those who condemn it or are unhappy with it, I think their issues don't really lie in their opinion of the film but elsewhere, closer to home (literally and metaphorically) in my opinion.As for the accusation that it is an anti-semitic work, I don't buy it for one second. In fact to me such an accusation shows how much those who view it as such are reacting defensively, and conforming to what they have heard about the film, and thus concluded the same esp. after seeing the brutality Jesus was subjected to, as seen in the film.When we go to church or read the Bible we are so sure of our faith and belief. But along comes a film such as this one, and our faith starts shaking at it's roots because we want to be entertained. Not that there is anything wrong with wanting to be entertained. All I can say such viewers not forget what is meant by the *passion* of the Christ. It is through his life/passion viewers get a deeper appreciation of what Jesus's life and message was in it's essence.I will watch this interpretation of the film any day over a sanitized and over-produced version of Christ's life. For those viewers who wish that the film was either muted in it's brutality against Jesus, or wanted to watch a film that entertained them...they can watch something else or watch TV.SkyeLight",The Passion of the Christ

Whether it was the intended purpose or not, these flashbacks almost serve as a relief from the more gruesome parts of the movie.You can read the biography and see the complete plot...there were no surprises. The movie was simply a visual depiction of the basis of the Christian faith. I can't imagine anyone leaving this movie without being emotionally affected.",The Passion of the Christ
589,kufurex,Put everything you've heard about the movie aside..,9,27 February 2004,"...and go see it, if you are so inclined of course.First off, if I hear one more person complain about it being too bloody and violent and that it did not include enough of Jesus' life, I am going to go berserk.  Like it has been said over and over by reviewers, the media, and Mr. Gibson, 'The Passion of The Christ' is exactly what the title says that it is; it is about the final twelve hours of Jesus' life.  And the last twelve hours did not consist of sermons, turning water into wine, or walking on water.  It was, however, the torture and eventual crucifixion of Christ. 
That particular criticism of the movie is utterly pointless.  Take issue with the cinematography, I dare you.  It is as deep and moving as a Caravaggio painting (which is indeed what Gibson asked his cinematographer to make the film look like).  Take issue with the acting.  But I do not think you'll have a leg to stand on there either.  Caviezel is nonexistent in this movie; all one can see is Jesus.  And the rest of the cast is just as wonderful.
Take issue with direction.  You will not find much to criticize.  It is as if the camera could not have been anywhere else.  Every shot was well angled, close or wide enough, and moved in perfect harmony with the action.Take issue with the editing.  This might be your best chance, because there was one cut in the early minutes of the film which seemed oddly out of place.And for the sake of logic, and thoughtfulness, do not try to pin an anti-semetic label on the film.  Jesus' radical views were threatening to the establishment of the Jewish leaders.  It was not all the Jews that wanted to get rid of him.  Where the events took place, a great portion of the population was Jewish, so inevitably some of the 'bad guys' are Jewish. No one will start hating Jews by seeing this movie; and if they already hate Jews, their hatred will not be enflamed.I saw it, and I was impressed by it.  I am a Christian, and have not been to church in a long time.  I did not run out of the theater to the nearest church, but it did make me think, and the thoughts have been in the back of my mind ever since.  If you do not want to see it, then you'll save nine dollars, and probably waste it on 'Along Came Poly'.  If you do decide to see it, I am sure you will let your opinion known to someone or another.

590,TheWildGoose,Superb film- if one knows a little bit about the subject matter.,9,16 February 2007,"I'll admit one thing about this film: if one has absolutely no knowledge of Christian theology, scripture, or tradition, one will probably not understand it. In that context, the violence might seem brutal and pointless, and the unpleasant viewing experience goes untempered by any higher meaning or purpose.To those with even a little knowledge of the subject matter, however, this is a masterpiece. It is a truly artistic and meaningful film, and the violence isn't random or sadistically brutal at all. ""Passion"" abounds in literary and artistic allusions, theological depth, countless double-meanings and clever flourishes, and brilliant technique. Even setting aside for the moment the excellent innovations unique to this film, the entire story brims with references to ancient stories from Christian tradition, and many of the shots mirror scenes from Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and other great Western art. The film draws inspiration from the Divine Mercy images of Saint Faustyna Kowalska, the paintings of Baroque master Caravaggio, the writings of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich, many long-established pious legends, and countless other sources.There is also rich philosophical, psychological, and theological depth here, and by no means is all of it from other sources alone. Though some have called the characterization ""flat"", ""Passion"" enables us to draw great insight from small actions (for example, the film reveals a great deal about Judas by showing his reaction to the children taunting him- he reacts outwardly, expressing rage at the children, rather than blaming himself for his emotional state), and is meant to be understood in a larger context that viewers will at least partly understand.This is all news, of course, to those who think that ""art"" is a phenomenon that began just before the start of the twentieth century. For many modern viewers, the allusions will be lost, the meaning will be inscrutable, and the physical beauty will be obscured by the admittedly grim violence.For those who know a bit about the subject matter, however, this is an example of an art form being used to its fullest extent.",The Passion of the Christ

How people find this disgusting dribble moving is a testament to the desensitization of the movie-going public. Perfectly fitting that The Lethal Road Warrior himself could one sentence from the Bible into a 2 hour bloodfest. It's no surprise that the man who obviously adores violence would put out such trash.The film made me sick to my stomach and I nearly passed out. Six hours later I am still sick. This comes from someone who had little problem with Faces of Death and Gangs of NY. This film revels in excessive non-stop brutality, Deschanel-izing the violent death of man that offered so much more that is entirely neglected.I was hoping to be inspired, not revolted. I was hoping to learn a little more about the man and perhaps see a film that chronicled his later years, not one long, drawn-out bloodbath.I have lost all the small amount of respect for Gibson I had.",The Passion of the Christ

593,j_a_newton,The Ultimate Passion Film,10,13 April 2004,"Never again will it be possible to depict the Passion of Jesus in a movie. (Or on stage, btw.) This is the *ultimate* one.Everything is excellent, from the cinematography to the props (no plastic armour on the Roman soldiers here!), from the grit of it all to the way the message is conveyed in pictures and symbols. Such as placing the Sermon on the Mount - which was about love and tolerance - on the Mount of Calvary. Nothing I have ever thought of before as a student of theology, but certainly interesting and innovative.None of the criticism against the film holds water. Anti-Semitic? Blah, in that case, Zefferelli's mighty Jesus film is just as Anti-Semitic - it depicts the religious establishment of the days in just the same way. And what about the fact that it is the *Romans* who are the sadists, whereas the Jewish people shows a great deal of ambivalence? And what about all the Jewish followers of Jesus? Or Jesus Himself?Violent? Blah. The flogging is *nothing* compared to, say, the splatter and gore of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"". Hey, Roman crucifixions were no picnic! Moreover, the torture of Jesus is punctuated with flashbacks of Jesus' message of love and tolerance, underlining the message even further.The only thing I have against it was that it requires a basic understanding of certain Biblical stories: the scene about Maria Magdalena becomes incomprehensible if you don't know what it was all about.But that's all. Go see it today. At a movie theatre, for the cinematic experience. And take some time to think about what the Man was all about.",The Passion of the Christ
594,benihana83,"Visually stunning, equally disturbing film his its impact.",9,19 April 2005,"One of the two most controversial films of the year, along with Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, The Passion of the Christ is a visual masterpiece. The Academy recognized it with nominations for cinematography, original score and makeup. While the content and storyline may not appeal to those unfamiliar with or opposed to Christian beliefs, it's hard not to respect what Mel Gibson brought to the screen on this project.One often overlooked aspect of many period epics is that everyone usually speaks English, when it is quite obvious that a Roman emperor or warrior during the Crusades would not have spoken that language. In Passion of the Christ, the dialogue is presented in the two languages of that time period, Aramaic and Latin, with English subtitles. This adds to the authenticity of the picture.James Caviezel gives a spirited performance as none other than Jesus Christ. His affect on the picture has less to do with his actual lines than with his facial expressions as he is beaten and flogged repeatedly.Indeed, beating and flogging must make up at least 75 percent of this film. I can say without a doubt that this will be the most violent movie you will ever see. Gibson has made certain of that, opting to focus on the Christian message of Christ's suffering and the last hours of his life rather than on his teachings. The result is a powerful image that may be too much for some viewers to handle.Nonetheless, The Passion of the Christ accomplishes what it set out to do. For those interested in the life of Jesus Christ, Gibson has painted a substantially gruesome, yet visually stunning and moving epic for viewers.",The Passion of the Christ
595,zombiezen,No Passion in the Passion,2,11 April 2004,"Ok i finaly went and saw it so that i could properly judge it without just having heard about it. Plus my honey wanted to see it so i figured whats the worst could happen? Lose two hours of my day? Burn up in fire and brimstone? I got nothing better to do anyways so off we went.I will give it credit for the acting and the effects were good but if i knew nothing of the bible i would have no clue what was going on in this movie. There is no set up or explanation as to why hes being persecuted except some arguments about blasphomy that don't explain much. Its mostly just torture although not as bloody or as much as critics would have you believe. I have seen much worse in Italian Horror.The Thing that shocked me most was the lack of emotion i felt during the whole thing. I thought ok sure im not a christian but yeeesh this is a story that has basic elements of loss and sacrafice and love in it, i should be able to feel something but nada. It is almost void of any spiritual messege unless your a devout christian already i don't see what you could get from the film. I remember thinking at one point if they did not speed up his crucifiction i was gonna die of boredom. Even the whipping was really quite dull and i didn't even cringe really. I do cringe too when something is graphic and hard to watch. as an example there is a whipping scene in a 1974 film called ""Don't torture a duckling"" by lucio fulci and its much shorter and less bloody than the passion of christ but to this day i watch it through my fingers cuz its just excruciating to watch. The difference? Ducking has characters you care about and the passion is devoid of anyone you care about cuz you don't know them. The Passion has no passion.I think Mel Gibson made a huge blunder in this and only very new gore hounds( and trust me the gore is very light in Passion. You want gore watch the original Dawn of the dead by Romero or Evil Dead trap out of japans new horror cinema) and those who are devout christians(the fundy kind most likely) will enjoy this film.

596,dschroe260,"Excellently done, and so much as I imagined of what happened!",10,26 March 2004,"I had heard the story of Jesus so many times and it always made my heart hurt, that human beings could do something so horribly to another human being - let alone our Lord and Savior, who only wanted great things for all of us. I had read the scriptures and even had seen a movie about Jesus Christ's life, when I was very young, but couldn't fathom the extent of unjust treatment, at that time. This movie really brought home the cruelty that was inflicted on Jesus. I kept watching, because I could not bare to look away and ignore the facts. I felt for Mary, as a mother myself, at the sounds she must have heard as she listened and watched the horrific treatment given to her son, and I felt for her as a mother - how much pain she must have gone through - and how powerless she must have felt!We owe Jesus everything, and there are people who want to pretend that it was merely a myth! I feel for those who chose to turn there backs and pretend that it never happened, and pretend that Jesus was just a man...May God have mercy on their souls as they are truly clueless and 'they know not what they do'.May God bless Mel Gibson for reminding us of what Jesus gave us and also may He bless all people who love Jesus Christ and uphold him in their prayers, and may we all recognize and remember the gift He gave us! God bless America.I feel ""The Passion"" was very well made and it sickens me that there are people who question the motives behind it, and even question that it happened at all...the same people, probably, who believe that there Jews were not prosecuted by Hitler's army! May God have mercy and open their eyes! I pray that all mankind will see the light and wake up to all that we must do to prepare for the second coming of Jesus Christ.",The Passion of the Christ

It has not miraculously changed my life but I have on dwelling on it, several times found myself in tears thinking not just of the brutality but of why and what the story is about.  If you are a believer, to see the whipping, the beating, the abuse and know the concept is that the punishment was ours but he received it instead as our salvation, is emotional for me.  Religious or not, I think it's a film all people should see.  Who knows what it could do for a life.  I really have no words to describe what I saw.  It's a dark film, the story, the photography, all of it, dark, dark, dark.  It is a movie to see more than once.  Like most movies/stories, you will not catch it all in a single viewing.  I will be buying it.  I believe I will view it better on a smaller screen.  If you can say it was excellent, then it was excellent.  It was bloody, brutal, sad, telling, emotional, inspiring and more, all at the same time.  It was a heartbreaker.  I went to see it hoping I will, in the long run, be a better person.

As a christian I believe in this, and now more than I ever did. It will change lives to experience what Christ went through, it's greater than any other depiction on film. If you don't believe this happened you are wrong. Mel Gibson took this right from Bible scripture. If you have a KJV bible, read the book of John chapters 18-21. You will find this is the building block of Gibson's masterpiece. No. no it's not anti-semitic, our sins killed Jesus. I must warn it is extremely graphic, the most violent picture I have ever seen BUT if Gibson showed how Christ really looked after his beatings, the movie would be unsuitable for any person to watch. Pace yourself, have an open mind, let emotions flow and be bold to view The Passion of the Christ.

Definetly.The Passion of the Christ, the controversial biblical epic directed by Mel Gibson, is perhaps the best film of 2004. The film stars Jim Caviezel as the Christ.The story follows Christ in his last 12 hours of physical life. The story of Christ's last hours are beautifully, graphically, yet understanably told.I do not see where any of the anti-semitism arises from this film. It would seem as though rabbis are trying to stop certain people from seeing this excellent movie.The violence is way overdone with reason. Every whip to his back, every amount of torture he suffered was for us. I believe this moral lesson of the movie: Dying was his reason for living.The film is impossible to sit through without wincing once. This is true. I would wince in my seat each time Christ was whipped. It pained me to watch. In the end though, Passion of the Christ was very enlightening. I broke down crying a half four after watching this movie because of how powerful it is. It hits you hard.To those who can't handle violence: Jesus took a physical beating for us. So why not take an emotional pounding for your own sake?It'll change your life. It changed mine.I recommend this film to everyone.",The Passion of the Christ
600,Goldwaterproductions,The best movie about Christ I have ever seen!!,10,20 December 2011,"Let's be perfectly clear that I am a Christian, but I have never been a big fan of Christian movies. I think most of the time they focus too much on the message they are trying to convey that they forget that they also need to make a good movie in order for anyone to take the message seriously. But I have always been a huge fan of movies based on famous stories from the Bible. This is one of the best films based on a story from the Bible I have ever seen. It is certainly the best Jesus movie ever made. Why is that? Because it's realistic. What Mel Gibson wanted to do was to show the brutality of how Jesus was tortured and eventually crucified. He doesn't candy-code it for little kids unlike almost every other Jesus movie (not saying those movies are bad, they just don't accurately depict Jesus' final hours). It's an R rated film and rightfully so. It's very violent and very hard to watch, but it's not gratuitous like an R rated action movie. It's artfully done. Besides it being realistic in the brutality of the violence, it has some excellent direction and great acting. Mel Gibson directs this movie excellently. The way how he shoots it is just beautiful. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination for this. James Caviezel gives probably the best performance of Jesus ever. He looks the part, he sounds the part, and he acts the part. The movie is 2 hours long but it's not dull. It keeps you interested the whole way through.Now I would recommend this film, but here are some disclaimers, it's rated R for gory violence so it's not for children and not for people who can't handle gory violence. It also has Satan in it and he may look disturbing to some people. It even has demon children which some may also find unsettling. But if you can get past these things and you are at the right age, then I would highly recommend this film.",The Passion of the Christ
601,FairiShadows,Shell Shocked,9,18 September 2004,"I sit in the moments following my first viewing of the film and I don't know whether to weep with sorrow or wretch in disgust. And for that alone, 'The Passion of the Christ' is certainly the most powerful and riveting films I have ever seen. I watched this film with the awe and fascination that one might gaze at a train wreck. It's gruesome and yet beautiful at the same time. I am not by any stretch of the word, a religious person, but it would be impossible not to be touched by the thunderous power of this film. Political and social ramifications aside, the knowledge of the story aside, 'The Passion of the Christ' managed to create a story that's been told for more than generations beyond our understanding and breathed a life into it that has never been done before nor may never be done again. It is difficult to say the movie was great or that it was horrible. For some reason, my personal tastes and what I consider to be good film don't really matter in this case. I can't say that I could ever watch this film again or even want to for that matter, but I don't think I would have to.

602,jr73340,A couple of things that MUST be said...,10,5 August 2012,"I have occasionally checked on the Passion-of-the-Christ comment page for the past eight years to see what people are saying about the movie. Here are some observations I have noticed:1) The people who don't like the movie are not being honest with themselves. I see hundreds of comments like ""Worst movie ever made"" and ""The most graphic gore I have ever seen"". These are clearly ridiculous exaggerations. I can understand if you don't like the movie, but it is not the worst movie EVER MADE; nor is the goriest movie EVER MADE.2) I would say close to 90% of the people are merely expressing their feelings about Christianity and not the film itself.3) Many protestant have written negative reviews not because the film was bad but because they have an irrational hatred of Catholicism and its teaching.4) How can a good God allow evil to happen, especially to good people? The question was answered in the movie. The good suffer for the sake of the bad. Christ's suffering empowers the suffering of good people and makes it redemptive. In other words, God has given the task of saving his enemies first and foremost to his Son, and secondarily to his friends here on earth.",The Passion of the Christ
603,R_MACKEN,"Brutal, stunning, but where is the story?",6,8 March 2004,"Before you read: I'm not religious, so some of the things I'm going to comment might be false.This movie really looked good, and the violence wasn't over the top, it was very realistic, and personally speaking I had no problems with it. There are some shots of this movie that are pretty stunning and impressive. Good peace of work when it comes to the cinematography!The movie is in a different language, and it made this movie more interesting than other religious movies that uses English. It also made the movie more authentic.But what seems to be the problem? The movie looks good, and sounds good, so what could be possibly wrong in this move?Where's the story? All I saw was Jesus being brutally crucified, and the scenes that show Jesuses past weren't satisfying. More could be done. It would have been a better if the movie had a little bit of balance between Jesuses past and his crucifixion. The Crucifixion wasn't too much at all, it was done just right.Where's the acting? The actors who played Jesus, Mary, and Pontius Pilate did a great job. But the small characters and extras did a horrible job. Judas and Peter overacted. There facial expressions isn't authentic, you can tell they were trying too hard to capture their characters emotions. Mary Magdalene seemed no existent in this movie, I forgot about her half way through the movie.This movie looked and sounded pretty, but it has no substance. It's like a really beautiful woman, with no personality.",The Passion of the Christ
604,GlennBeckFan,"Pity, shame, and, above all, Love.",10,25 February 2004,"In my opinion, `The Passion of the Christ' is the best movie ever made. Mel Gibson has sculpted a masterpiece equivalent with any work of Rodin, Michelangelo or da Vinci.Even absent from the obvious spiritual implications of the story; this film is exquisite.  With masterful cinematography, art direction, costuming, and make up, the viewer is transported to the time of Christ.  Gibson captures the pain, the misery, the hate while buffering it with pity, shame, and, above all, Love.  Even if you do not believe in the life changing message of the carpenter from Nazareth, you will know his heart, his spirit, his humanity.I have never experienced a movie to this degree. Using cinema to bewitch the eyes and the ears, you are there in the crowd with its chaos, confusion, filth, and loathing.  Like most Americans in this generation, I have witnessed much bloodshed in the name of entertainment.  Today I, and others in the audience, seemingly felt it.  Rods bruised my back.  Whips tore my flesh.  My hands and feet were pierced.  I felt Mary's tears, Peter's shame, Judas' madness. As surely as it was happening to the man of sorrows: so was it happening to me.  I am grateful the director chose to present this without the use of English. Hearing these words uttered in the original tongue contributes to the stark realism resulting in a piece that is riveting and meditative.Without being preachy, Gibson communicates Jesus' Divine nature through the words spoken by the immensely talented James Caviezel (at last, a brown eyed Christ!).  He leaves little to debate but much to ponder. Artistic license is used to bridge some scenes however this instrument does not distract from the premise.Allow me to state that it is bewildering how anyone could view this as anti-Semitic.  It is not the Jewish people who are slandered; rather it is most of their leaders who are adequately portrayed as lying, thieving sons of Perdition.  If anything the rapturous sadism of the Roman soldiers should be enough to make the weak minded hate Italians.  But I will let a higher authority comment on such base, visceral thoughts, `Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.' Rosalinda Celentano's androgynous Satan could easily have stolen the show in most Hollywood productions.  In `The Passion' she is a consummate background character fading in and out of the tapestry.  She may lack a name but she is nightmarishly acquainted to the viewer; sowing seeds of wrath, murder, decadency, and, perhaps worst of all, indifference.Note: The extraordinary amount of violence leads me to recommend against anyone under the age of 12 of viewing this film.  The affects would likely be too disheartening and important lessons may be lost.It is, in the end, an interpretation, not the event itself.  And some critics will not like it even regardless of their opinion about the Galilean.  However, in this age, it is likely that most in the entertainment world will not hear the Messiah's sweet, soft voice because they are too busy yelling `Crucify!  Crucify!  Crucify!'  Some will spit on this film because they disagree with its conclusions.  Others will strike its face because they lack a conscious. Alas, such scars might testify more about the soul of the perpetrator than the product or for that matter, the subject.",The Passion of the Christ

I was VERY disappointed in this film, and being a religious person and also a Christian, I feel that this film missed the point. Did Mel Gibson think that we had to actually SEE his version of the crucifixion in order to believe?? And that's all there is to this movie - no plot, no acting, the musical score is just so-so ( to hear a GREAT score, watch BEN-HUR). There is only blood (lots of it) and suffering. Not enough of the wonderful teachings of Christ, the miracles he performed, his guidance of the Apostles, etc. There was no lead-up to explain why the temple priests hated him. And in my opinion, if Jesus really was beaten and scourged as bad as depicted in this film, He never would have made it to Calvary - he would have died at the scourging from blood loss. I believe His suffering was very great but Mel - come on - we know exaggeration when we see it. No, the film could have been so much better, if other points were presented more: Love your enemies - do good to those who hate you, and the most important one: Blessed is he who has Not seen, yet believes. Last of all, the Resurrection was so totally down-played. This was the most important thing to show that his suffering was not in vain - and all there was in the film was Jesus sitting in the cave, then gets up and leaves! What an attention-getter.

All Mel Gibson did was to follow the bible.... and I can't say for all of the movie, but for many of the scenes he actually used the exact words in the bible. I am a Christian and I thought this movie was made with a purpose. I think that the so-much-talked-about violence has a purpose. Mel Gibson uses this violence to emphasize just how much Jesus suffered for us, in an attempt to restore our faith in God. Did anybody think of it from this point of view? And Christians are saying they wouldn't take their kids to this movie. But my question is: would they take their kids to another movie about Jesus, where he is betrayed and then ridiculed and killed on a cross, with less violence? Do kids really understand what happened and why it happened? Do they understand that God sent his son to Earth so that he would die in order to redeem mankind? I think that in a world like today where more and more people are losing their faith in God, a movie like this helps us to appreciate even more the sacrifice that God made in order to save us, and helps us to wonder whether or not his sacrifice was worth it, whether we appreciate it as much as we should.It is a powerful movie and I admit, it was very hard to watch, as a Christian. But any other movie where Jesus is beaten and killed would be as equally hard to watch, or at least it would be for me.I am not saying I like violence in movies, but if you think about it, there is so much violence in movies for absolutely no purpose, but in this movie there is one.",The Passion of the Christ

I dont feel his presence was needed...it was almost cartoonish.I did not view the Jews as evil nor do I now after seeing the film.

I could not find English version of this movie, but after watching clip I watched it with the help of English subtitles.I barely give 10/10 to any movie, but this movie has given me goose bumps. Excellent work by actor Jim, Director Mel Gibson and his team. And makeup - OMG, wow, its brilliant, have my words, you would be speechless and movie would made you think how much hard and smart work is done on wounds of Jesus. Instead of explaining facts of the movie I would say I cannot express this movie in my words, please watch and decide.Don't watch this movie from blood/violence perspective, look from the suffering of Jesus.

The film was controversial when first released, because it mainly stuck to the Gospels with the Sanhedrin wanting Jesus executed. Political correctness in the modern age has meant that became controversial, even though Jesus Christ Superstar has the same account. Jim Caviezel was outstanding. One of the best Jesus' ever. The whole cast was excellent.",The Passion of the Christ
613,chrysalis_writter,"The Flaying of the Christ; Incomplete, and uninspired.",4,3 September 2004,"Not being religious I have no bias toward watching a Christ figure get caned, torn up and crucified, however watching Scorsese brilliant, if too long, The Last Temptation of Christ (the temptation being Lucifer offering Christ a mans life if he gives up his role as the savior, guess which choice Jesus makes?)I was able to become involved with the character and what drove him. In Gibson's telling of the last 12 hours (with a few flashbacks to fill in plot holes)I get nothing but a feeling that Christ should have just stayed down when he had the chance.Let me make some points here:First: The story starts with Judas selling out Christ, it should have started with Christ coming to the Temple and saying he would tear it down and rebuild it in three days. This is the thing that inflamed the Jews to want him dead so bad, he threatened their power. Leaving this out of the film only leaves the viewer trying to grasp why they hated him.Second: No emotional involvement. Gibson tries to let the torture speak for itself. There's nothing more than fleeting flashbacks with Jesus (pronounced hea'shu) and either Mary his mother or his love, nothing to emotionally attach them to him, or us. Watching his mother weep over him when he gets back up after a brutal beating is called to an end, inflaming the Romans to inflict more damage, feels hollow. We haven't established anything beyond 'this is mom.' He could have pointed the camera at any weeping extra in the crowd and put a subtitle 'my son!' under her with equal impact. You have to ask, what the hell did he get up for? To be hurt more! Why? So he'd be a martyr. You know, I want Kerry elected president, should I invite Republicans to beat me to death to prove how horrible I think they are? There is a scene in The Village where a character is stabbed, there's nearly no blood, zero gore, yet the emotional impact is heavy, you fear for his life, you feel for his girl and you hate his killer. There's a castration scene in I Spit On Your Grave that shows nothing because it all takes place under a bubble bath, yet you know it's happening and you squirm and you want to look away. Then there's the F*** me Jesus scene in the Exorcist when you desperately want the suffering of the little girl to stop. In this film I just wanted Jesus to Stop Getting Up!Third: Gibson's Christ is not a persecuted Jew trying to lead people to the love of God, his father, he's a self righteous bastard who says ""father my heart is ready"" before torture ""Father, why have you forsaken me"" when he's nailed to a cross and ""I'm ready"" when he's had enough. Now why does he tell God he's ready to be flayed, then complain when it happens. Christ offers himself up for torture, then looks on as if to say, ""see what I do for you?"" Well, how asked him? Forth: No conclusion. Not only does Gibson not bother to show us why they Jews hate him (oddly, only Pilot's motivations are clearly shown, in the end he's the one you feel bad for, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, but doesn't what his head off either.) but doesn't show that any good comes out of it.Fifth: The Devil. What's with the Nelly - Demon - Reaper??? Some androgynous freak torments Christ, yeah, see the root of homophobia is that Gibson portrays Tran gendered people as Lucifer.Sixth: Now Ascension? What the hell, he rises and fade to black? What's this? Where's the lords message? Nowhere in this film. This film is a knock-off of Barker's Hellraiser. 127 minutes of torture with no beginning and no conclusion. A three hour film would have let us see Christ live and love before the crucifixion, and let us see the impact of resurrection. However Gibson just wanted an exploitation of pain thinly veiled as religious rhetoric.Last: If you believe in Christ, share what he stood for, not how he died! Peace, Love, Good Will. Not self righteous martyrs! Not Pain! Not Violence! Not hate and ignorance! This is a film only for those who know the entire story by heart because this is just one long scene way out of context.Finally: See the Last Temptation of Christ and Dogma, two misunderstood films made by people who love there lord and savior and want people to walk out with the positive not negative. Enough with the hell and damnation, let Clive Barker do that, he's better at it.",The Passion of the Christ
614,RandyL712,"An extremely violent movie, intended to incite and excite",4,25 February 2004,"Mel Gibson has revealed himself as a fervent zealot, and this film is his opus.  Gibson isn't to blame for the anti-semitic tones, those are present in the New Testament, but this movie takes care to make sure that nobody leaves without hating Jews and blaming them for the death of Jesus Christ. The unbelievable violence may be present to illustrate just how great his sacrifice was, but to constantly show Jews as the aggressor can't do anything except incite racist and bigoted emotions.  In reality, people were beaten, killed and crucified every day in Biblical times, and Jesus wasn't considered very special by either the people or the Roman leaders.  John the Baptist was treated similarly, but didn't have five or six people spreading the gospel, working hard to create a new religion in his name.  This movie makes it seem as if everybody was obsessed with Jesus, when most people didn't know he even existed until hundreds of years later.",The Passion of the Christ

The whole film just don't look like a film. It seems that Jesus is just leaving his mortal body and being immortal in front of you! It makes you feel that YOU are the only human being who has never understood God and his prophet! YOU are the only sinner for whom HE has to die and what else. Mere words can not express the emotions! I will not say anything about the actors and their character in the film because for me all of them never let me feel like one.

617,yediotm,Bad Film,1,7 September 2004,"What a disappointment. I have waited a few months before watching this flick. The movie was called a Dario Argento styled version of the Passion. Since I love Argento I had great expectations.However the passion was just plain sadistic-masochistic whining piece of celluloid. Sorry, but the joy Gibson found on torturing poor Jesus was too much for me. The many suffering faces mr. Caviezel made all through the movie just made me despise this figure on the screen. Don't do this to Jesus, you make him look pathetic. this film was about going to the limit in showing every way you can make j.c. suffer and make poor pathetic faces for the camera. But at the end, it was more like a parody. I felt disgust at the manipulative efforts of the film. I don't know what sick s**t this is. It seems Gibson enjoys torturing J.C. more than the roman soldiers in the film, or maybe this is some kind of spiritual experience of pain, agony, or something of the sort. No idea. To me it just seemed plain perverse, sorry. I am sure there are better ways to love Jesus who was a nice chap all in all.",The Passion of the Christ

Words cannot describe this film. I was sad, disgusted, crying....almost every emotion that man can have, I think I felt during this film. Mel Gibson has outdone himself, and I applaud him.This film focuses on the last 12 hours of the life of Christ. That's it. No sermons, no preaching, no miracles....we do not see any of this, only a few scenes in flashbacks. But that is what the film is about...the PASSION of Christ. And it really, really hits home. Watching Jesus taking the punishment from his captors, being betrayed by his disciples....made me realize how much he actually suffered to save us. Is it violent....of course!!! That is the point!! To show us how much Jesus suffered to save our souls. Sure, there were times I couldn't really watch the screen, however, it was mesmerizing...and I think it did the job.Definately a film worth seeing if you are a Catholic like myself, or a Christian.

619,Muxje,This is no eye-opener! (4/10),4,24 March 2004,"Well, I finally got to see what all the fuss is about.  I was disappointed though, and from a movie that has stirred up such controversy, I had expected more, well... controversial content.The good: All spoken language is either Arameic or Latin; a touch that lends a lot of realism to this movie.  The setting, costumes and actors add to a believable reproduction.  We aren't spared any of the gruesome bits either: the flogging of Christ at the hand of Roman legionnaires, and the crucifixion, are particularly hard to watch.  Rather than skip over the gory parts, this movie shows things as they really might have happened: well done.The bad: My gripe with this movie is that it does not show us anything *new*.  We are shown the exact story that we already know, with only a few snippets of Jesus' personal life thrown in.  The characters are as flat as cardboard cutouts.Compare this film with that other controversial movie about Jesus: The Last Temptation of Christ.  I expected at least the same sort of thing from the Passion: thought-provoking new ideas, challenges to our existing set of beliefs about Christ, and above all something that shows us the *person* Christ might have been.  Sadly, there is none of any of that.",The Passion of the Christ
620,nimbleweevil,All shine and irritating substance,4,17 December 2006,"I went into this movie REALLY wanting to like it. Even as a non-Christian, the story of Jesus has always fascinated with me, and there have been so many different takes on it that it's always interesting to see another one.Director Mel Gibson certainly gets an A for effort - the man must have done some amount of research, to come up with an entire script in an obscure language that almost nobody speaks, so that he could wave it in the faces of the viewers how historically accurate he was trying to be. On a less sarcastic note, the visuals are beautiful, and the cast is in top-form. Jim Caviezel and Maia Morgenstern, as Jesus and the Virgin Mary, have some immensely touching moments, particularly during scenes where Jesus flashes back to better, less violent times.Perhaps the acting and cinematography impressed me so because I had not heard about them ad nauseum before going to see the movie. I had heard nothing but good about the overall theme, how moving it was, how there wasn't a dry eye in the theater, et cetera. In this respect, I was deeply, deeply disappointed. I expected to see a beautiful, moving film about the unjust but heroic death of an enlightened man who was way before his time, and I was subjected to a relentless two-and-a-half hour guilt trip. Little attention is paid to the wonderful aspects of Jesus's life that make his death so horrifying. Instead, the viewer experiences an endless bloodbath of whips, chains, crowns of thorns, cow carcasses, and evil bloodthirsty crows. Gibson effectively spends the entire film pointing at the viewers and shouting ""YOU DID THIS! YOU! YOU!"" Meanwhile, the viewers are heading for the toilet, either due to nausea from the amount of fake blood that is showering the screen, or as a break from the boredom caused by what is basically the same scene repeated, with small variations, for almost the entire movie.Additionally, Gibson needs to figure out some way to do special effects other than slow motion. After the eighty-third time Jesus dropped the cross, I wanted to throw something at the screen.I wish there was more positive I could say more about what should have been a lovely work of art. Kudos to the actors and the crew, and semikudos to Gibson for speaking his mind, even though we certainly don't all agree with him. That said, this was one of the most all-around annoying films I have ever sat through. Better luck next time, Mel.",The Passion of the Christ
621,rickyricardomokwena,Outstanding & brilliantly exceptional.,10,18 March 2014,"This is the best representation of the suffering of 'Christ' in the 21st century.Most movies that depict the life of Christ are either never intriguing or plain simple boring.But not this one!First of all 'Mel Gibson' does not like relying on Computer Generated Imaging to complete his work which is his strong point as it worked well also in 'Apocalypto'.It did tremendous effect on the scolding and lashing of Jesus, although it is mostly unbearable to watch but hits perfectly on the message the movie was intended to portray.Which was mentioned by the Devil in the opening scenes of the movie where he quotes 'do you really believe that one man can bear the full burden of sin' and he goes on to say 'no one man can carry this burden,I tell you it is far too heavy'.The Passion of the Christ goes on to reveal that indeed Jesus can carry the burden of sin by himself and he does.The characterization of this movie is on point with most of Jesus's dialog picked from famous verses quoted by Jesus himself in the bible in no particular order.These are quotes that followers of Christ and bible scholars worldwide are familiar with and will be able to relate to.This works to great effect as this is a movie not a documentary and the way Mel Gibson touches on the subject of the Devil and evil itself with scenes of the him appearing to taunt Jesus.This is a topic most movies about Christ do not portray and shy away from.The acting is believable although most of the actors used had little acting experience and some non at all.Mel Gibson's style of directing holds it all together, it is outstanding and carries the movie with so much dramatization as well as high quality camera work that will leave a lasting impression in the mind of the viewer.The Passion of the Christ is the type of movie that stays in your head after watching it and will get you converted to Christ if you are not yet a follower.Big ups for Mel this one is a definite hit.",The Passion of the Christ
622,originalgrooviemanncomic,South Park's Take on this was Spot-On the EXACT Same Reaction I Had!,1,1 October 2017,"Mel Gibson is an actor I enjoy from stuff like Mad Max, Road Warrior, Braveheart, etc. Here, the Passion of the Christ in my belief is one of the worst, if not, the worst film I've ever seen. No harm to Mel Gibson at all, I just think the focus of Jesus' torture was overdone, painful to sit through and irritating if you really are aware of Christianity in its senses. I give myself credit for watching the whole film, but I refuse to hinder myself in how it contradicts the title in a whole. Jesus' Passion wasn't to be a glutton for punishment, from what you can and I presumed with the title--the film would focus on Jesus' teachings and the wisdom he tried to spread for humans all were dropped in favor for violence that makes a play of Jesus seem more interesting.The film never lets you breathe when violence is apart of the view, it is hard to even proceed watching more. Jesus' torture scenes and the focus really disgusted me and I felt South Park's episode, ""Passion of the Jew"" really summed up how EXACTLY I felt after seeing the film. Sucked, unpleasant and I tried to wish God for 127 minutes refunded in my life. Troll 2 most consider the worst film of all time, NOT Me, at least they had more effort despite how B-Movie and cheesy it was. Same for South Park, a cartoon as bold and blunt as can be, nailed my belief on the film.If you want to learn more about Jesus--Not this film. At All!...",The Passion of the Christ
623,sternn01,The Passion of the Christ,8,21 June 2006,"To all those people out there who feel that this film is somehow flawed or that it feeds racist sentiments, I would ask that you actually read and study the New Testament Gospels. Yes, director Gibson took some artistic license with his film, but that in itself does not overpower the message that Christ suffered and died for all of us, and thereby won salvation for people who could not do it on their own. This film is violent and gruesome, and you may avert your eyes because it is hard to watch, but it is also the most accurate depiction of how much Christ had to suffer. It is based on events that are portrayed in the Gospels, and every Christian is familiar with these accounts and their history.This film shows just a tiny fraction of this history, the final twelve hours prior to Christ's death on the cross. It does not tell the whole story of the Israelites, Gods chosen people, and how time and again they were reminded to obey Gods commands, but failed to do so. You see, the Hebrews of the Old Testament were sinners like you and me. They could not keep Gods commands, so they, like all of us, needed a savior, a Messiah, who would lift the yoke of bondage to our sinful nature. Unfortunately, by the time Christ arrived on the scene, they did not recognize him for who he was. I imagine it was a difficult proposition for them. ""You mean we have to give up all of our ancient laws and traditions from the time of Abraham and Moses? We have to put all our faith in this one man? Impossible. It's too simple. Certainly there is more to it than that?"" But that was Christ's message while he was on earth. He had a daunting task during his ministry, because he was preaching not only to Gentiles but to Jews as well, who had carried a lot of baggage with them throughout the years. When Jesus moved his ministry to Jerusalem, where the seats of power were for the Jewish faith, they took it as a slap in the face. The chief priests and Jewish leaders were incensed that this Nazarene could come in with his touchy-feely message of ""love"" and ""peace"", and still attract so many followers. Again they missed the point, as we so often do today with Gods Word. The Gospel message frees us; it releases us from our requirement to pay for our sins. It doesn't stop us from sinning mind you, that is something we are born with, but it will go a long way towards easing a guilty conscience, and that is the true ""peace that passes all understanding"". If you tell someone who feels they have not sinned, that their sins are forgiven, do you think its going to have any impact? I submit that it will not. In fact, human arrogance and pride dictates that we will react with anger. However, if you tell someone who knows and feels the weight and sorrow of a guilty conscience, that all has been forgiven, well, that type of message has the power to change lives - dramatically. And it has done so throughout history for many, many people. That's why the Jewish leaders were so angry. They were looking for a new king who would take them out from under the oppression of the Roman government. Not a spiritual King who came to our sin-ridden planet from the paradise of heavenly glory, in his mercy, to live a perfect life, die on the cross, and then resurrect himself to announce his victory over sin death and the devil. This film is important because it doesn't try to convince anyone of anything. Its just telling the story of Christ passion and suffering in the most effective way possible. It's gruesome because Mr. Gibson felt that he had to show how much our sins cost the Lamb of God. This is not a politically correct point of view, but then neither is Christianity or the idea of sin for that matter. And because this is based on historical events and Gods unchangeable Word, it amazes me that with the release of this film, people seem to be surprised and shocked at what its portraying. Has everyone who is upset over this movie ever read the Gospels before? This is pretty much how it happened. Jesus was tortured and killed. Period. At the time, this happened on a pretty regular basis.And to clarify, the Jews are not ""Christ Killers"". Jesus died at the hand of the Romans and at the behest of the Jewish religious leaders. That is how it went down in history, but the fact of the matter is that it was Gods will that His Son die, because He loved us so much, and did not want to see our destruction in hell. Man in general, not just the Jews and Romans, were instruments of Gods Holy Will.Now is what I wrote racist in any way? If anything, I have illustrated that the Jews are just like anyone else in this world, sinful human beings who need a savior. Many will think that this attitude is just another example of Christian arrogance and superiority. No, it is not. I'm not saying that we can earn our way into heaven. To say that would be the height of human arrogance and superiority. Christ did this for us already  and this film is just a glimpse of what Jesus suffered. I think Mr. Gibson has shown that he is putting his money where his faith is and I applaud him for it.",The Passion of the Christ
624,Melanie82-1,Artistically Brilliant though Not Always Accurate,8,17 September 2008,"Artistically, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a masterpiece. It combines fine acting, good cinematography, truly disturbing though not pointless imagery, and even a couple of ancient languages (Latin and Aramaic). It also got a lot of Christians thinking more about their Lord's sufferings. On the whole these were the good parts and I recommend the film though it is suitable only for mature audiences. The film is not perfect historically and I think it may have some theological weaknesses as well. For instance, Greek should have been employed in the film and Christ was likely nailed to a Tau cross (T) rather than a Latin cross (t). Dr. Zugibe does a nice but short critique of the film in his book ""The Crucifixion of Jesus: Second Edition."" Theologically, I think this film may make Christians look too much at Christ's physical sufferings. After all, crucifixion is often considered one of the worst forms of execution but there are others likely as bad or worse. Even regarding crucifixion, many men, women, and children have sadly died on crosses. What made Christ's sufferings unique was the spiritual atoning angle, not purely physical pain. That said, that may be impossible to capture well in a film so I should perhaps let Gibson off the hook there. Overall, a well-made film that is not anti-semitic though it is not a film for all viewers.",The Passion of the Christ

626,ljp-2,The critics are wrong! This is the greatest plea against hatred ever,10,1 March 2004,"I've been reading about and curiously awaiting this film for months, and now that I've finally seen it for myself, I can only say first ""what a powerful experience!"" and second, ""how can so many critics be so wrong?""
I am a Christian, and like Mel Gibson, a Catholic. I share his beliefs about the suffering and death of Jesus.  But like the powerful filmmaker he is, he took me to an understanding of that death and what it means for all of us that I never before had, or ever expected to have. I'd like to add that the slanders against against Mel in the press -- that's he's an ultratraditionalist who is anti-Semitic, doesn't accept Vatican II, etc. -- are utterly false.  His interview with Diane Sawyer proved that his mind is with the Church (he merely prefers Tridentine-rite Masses as many orthodox Catholics do).  His screening of his film for John Paul II proves it.  Above all, his film proves it. This is a beautiful, compassionate film brimming with sorrowful love for humanity. From the very first moments, when I saw the anguished and terrified Jesus weeping in Gethsamane, I was drawn in by the emotion.  Jim Caviezel transformed himself so utterly into a first-century Palestinian Jew speaking Aramaic that there was absolutely not disbelief to be suspended -- I was there.  I watched his suffering with what felt like a ten-ton weight of sorrow on my chest and often overflowing eyes.  The attractive strength and grace this wonderful actor showed in the flashbacks to his preaching and the Last Supper moved me even more for Jesus' sorrows. (I would love to watch him in a film of the complete life of Christ). And how can I ever forget the heart-wrenching, haunting (and nearly wordless) portrayal of Jesus' mother Mary by Jewish actress Maia Morgenstern?  Mary suffers so much with her Son, but she knows why it has to be done. When I heard her say ""so be it"" to the beginning of the Way of the Cross, I thought back to what C. S. Lewis said -- there must have been a lot of iron as well as gentleness in the Virgin.  All the other performances were equally compelling. The violence was brutal and harrowing, true, but I didn't find it as difficult to watch as I have other violent films (I had to keep my eyes closed during the whole first half hour of ""Saving Private Ryan""). Here I was held fast to the screen.  I thought: If Jesus suffered this for me, I can certainly bear to watch it.  And I did.The film's reality was amazing.  I might quibble with a few historical details, but that is definitely beside the point.  Most of all, I admire the way that Mel has understood the meaning of the Passion and not wavered from it.  In this film, he couldn't show the whole of the teachings of Christ. He concentrated on the teaching about love.  It was done almost entirely through the actions of the characters and a few well-chosen words. 
That is why those who say this movie is hate-filled, or will incite anti-Semitism are wrong.  Many people, of course, have said that already here.  But I don't think anyone has pointed out just how deeply the message of universal love comes through the film.  Everyone is lined up on one side or another.  Either you love or you do not.  Either you show compassion or you do not.  Critics are arguing over whether the Jews or the Romans were responsible.  They argue whether Pilate is depicted more sympathetically than Caiaphas.   This totally misses the point.  There are two very different, but equally horrible, types of guilt here. Caiaphas, the high priest, is depicted as a grim, narrow-minded fanatic, implacably self-righteous.  People claim he wasn't seen as being ""conflicted"" like Pilate.  But self-righteous fanaticism isn't very often conflicted (I imagine Osama bin Laden sleeps pretty well nights.  His kind always do).  But this type of hatred isn't confined to a single time or to one religion. It is with us always. The film does not show the whole Sanhedrin this way, much less the whole Jewish people.  Other members of the Sanhedrin protest the unfairness and illegality of the trial.  Many ordinary Jews show compassion for Jesus.Is Pilate conflicted?  Sure.  He's conflicted over which course of action will best save his own skin.  He tells his second-in-command to have Jesus beaten within an inch of his life ""but don't kill him.""  There is no real compassion in this man. Pure political calculation is like that.  To underscore this, Gibson has Pilate's wife cut through his self-pitying ""what is truth"" monologue by saying ""if you can't hear truth, no one can tell you."" Then she goes out and crosses the racial and social barriers to show compassion to the mother of Jesus. Truth IS compassion.Racism and hatred are rampant everywhere in this film. And it is significant that the racism is entirely directed by the Romans against the Jews. Pilate complains about the Jews as a smelly rabble he doesn't like or understand, as he stays completely isolated in his palace.  When Simon of Cyrene, who is forced by the Romans to help Jesus carry the cross, and who at first doesn't want to get involved, begins to show compassion for Jesus, the Roman soldiers kick him and spit out ""Jew"" at him. And the message was carried through to its unbearable but triumphant conclusion. I watched as Jesus was scourged until his back was a bloody pulp.  I watched as he said ""My heart is ready, Father,"" and embraced the terrible cross.  I watched him forgive his tormenters again and again, and even, when he was almost unable to move because of the pain, crawl to the cross so he could lay his arms be nailed, so we could be saved from our hatred and violence. No, this film does not incite hatred!  Jesus even forgives Caiaphas specifically.  And how does the fanatic react?  Well, it's enigmatic, but -- just watch for yourself. I think the problem so many secular film critics have is that they are unwilling to face the real cause of violence and hatred, much less face its real cure. They want to dwell on anything but that.  They want to have a film with Caiphas and Pilate politely debating politics, because that's what they're comfortable with.  They want to argue about who had the most guilt 2,000 years ago, so they can ignore their own. They want the death of Jesus to be about anything but what it really was about -- the reality of sin, especially violence and hatred, and our need to be saved from it. And the hypocritical ranting about violence!  The lovers of ""Kill Bill"" suddenly crying ""ICK! Get that blood OFF me!""  In fact, the majority of U.S. film critics would get my nomination for Pontius Pilates of the Year.  They don't want the blood on them and they wash their hands of this film.  But if we truly understand, then like Mary at the foot of the cross, we will embrace not only Jesus, but his saving blood as well.",The Passion of the Christ

628,Dave D-2,A Film of unprecedented impact!,10,16 March 2004,"I urge everyone to see ""The Passion of the Christ"" ONCE. Having said that, I don't think I could see it again until perhaps I own it on DVD. More than any film I have EVER seen (and I've seen thousands) this film drained me totally and I could barely get up and walk out of the cinema after the end credits started to roll. It is an awesome, harrowingly realistic work of cinematic art that is made all the more relevant by subject matter - the ultimate sacrifice for all of mankind. Most of those who have gone to see the film recently have likely been motivated by curiousity. I appeal here not to the curious (you'll likely go anyway) but to everyone else. Go to see this film and take your children (as long as they are over 11 yrs) so that you can experience a film like you may never again have the chance to experience.Finally, for those who complain of violence, the graphic suffering of Christ pales in comparison to several other violent films that have screened recently (Kill Bill being a particularly appropriate example). The reason people find complain about it being violent, lies in the mastery of the film - its ability to portray suffering in a totally believable manner.A 10 out of 10!",The Passion of the Christ

630,tharnax,"Strange, but enduring...",7,14 March 2006,"Despite the strange character portrayals (Satan, Pilate) and gory violence (possibly the bloodiest movie yet), 'Passion' has many enduring moments. Scenes such as Mary rushing to help her son during his fateful walk to the hill at Golgotha, as well as Christ passing on his duties as son before his death are indeed unforgettable.This movie is gripping and visceral, definitely worth seeing for persons of every faith. Film critics immediately attacked Mel Gibson's portrayal of the Jewish people in this film, setting in motion a massive publicity bonfire that fed the flames of the movie's success. Personally, I felt the presentation of the Jewish people was roughly parallel to that of the New Testament account within the Bible (with the exception of the demon kids, and additional punishment to Christ on his way to trial). The controversy surrounding this picture was immense, Hollywood was outraged but helpless to stop the film's release due mainly to the heavy audience pull and box office power of Mel Gibson(who also wrote,directed and starred in the violent smash-hit Braveheart). Movie-goers were intrigued by the growing controversy as well as Gibson's sudden, and intense faith-based statements. This film was most successful amongst protestant Christians here in the US, Entire churches bought out showings all over the country and helped to push the already controversy-driven box office gross past the $300 million mark. A landmark blockbuster was unleashed, What will Gibson create next?",The Passion of the Christ
631,plowboy4,Amazing and heart wrenching,10,29 February 2004,"By far the most accurate description of Christ's final hours that I have seen on film. Gruesome, gory, violent to the extreme, but not at all out of place in the context of the Passion story. I was in tears watching this film, and winced with nearly every lash of the whip and rods, and as the nails were driven in. It was beautifully acted, shot, and the music was excellent. The performances were top notch from Gibson's direction to the actors and actresses. Profoundly moving and heart wrenching. This is not a film for children (although I saw many in the theater), it is far too graphic in my opinion. However, it is a must see for any believer.Kudos to Mel Gibson for his guts to make this film by putting up his own money to do so. He has done a wonderful job telling in detail the story of the greatest sacrifice mankind has ever known.",The Passion of the Christ
632,WCBrown,This is not entertainment . . .,9,8 April 2004,". . . . Then what is it?  A graphic portrayal of what it took for God to redeem the human race, plain, simple, to the point.  It is central to the Gospel message . . . the sacrificial death and triumphal resurrection of the Savior of the world, and the movie displays the message graphically and verbally.  The twelve hours of agony portrayed in about 2 hours of celluloid is perfectly balanced by the one minute shot of the risen Christ.  His sufferings were temporary . . . His triumph is forever and affects us all. If you are a believer, this movie at least should convict you to fall in love with the Savior and walk with Him daily.  At most, it will motivate you to choose the way of discipleship to become like Him to further the Kingdom of God.  If you are an unbeliever with an open mind and an appreciation for the self-imposed sufferings of humanity, this movie should convict you to at least honestly examine the claims of Jesus Christ and at most accept Him as Savior and Lord of your life.Now, with the central message aside, Mel Gibson's directing style is reminiscent of director Franco Zeffirelli's attention to historical and cultural detail in his Jesus of Nazareth movie with Gibson providing an additional emphasis with the original languages of the time.  It is true that Koine Greek was the multi-cultural business language of the region like English is today in the world, and that it was the primary language the writers of the New Testament used beginning some 15-30 years later. However, Aramaic was the other widely accepted common `street' language with Hebrew and Latin limited to the pockets of the cultures that developed those languages, namely the Jews and the Romans.  So it was irrelevant which common language Gibson chose to use in the film as some other critics were quick to make an issue of because it could have been either one.  My only issue with The Passion was that some of the acting was a tad melodramatic as though what was happening to Jesus was unusual.  To the Romans and most of the Jews this was just another day of Roman justice and a lot more common than some would suppose.  There were thousands of crucifixions done in Palestine within a two hundred year span and Jesus' was just one of many despite some of the extraordinary phenomena that surrounded it (i.e. earthquakes, rending of the veil in the temple, raising from the dead of others besides Jesus, etc.).  This explains why there is such little historical reference to the events apart from the writers of the New Testament, a brief reference by the Jewish historian Josephus, and a couple of inscriptions.John Debney did a wonderful job of setting the various moods of the movie with his compositions, much like John Williams, but with a more somber tone and cultural twinge.  The set designs, makeup, costumes, and scoring was all quality and added to my enjoyment of the movie and I did indeed feel transported back in time some 2,000 years.  In my opinion, a movie has not done its job unless it is believable and draws you into the story.  No doubt, getting both detractors (orthodox Jews, skeptics, and negative film critics) and proponents (word-of-mouth, mainly from the churches and early screenings which impacted many) of the film involved in the pre-release hype was marketing genius and went beyond everyone's expectations though I do not think it was deliberate by Icon Productions.  Religion stirs the passions of many, both pro and con.  Quite frankly, I did not expect The Passion to do as well as it did in the box office but I am happy that Gibson got at least a thousand percent return on his investment.  I give the film 9 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ

Love the other just like ourselves. After the almost killing process of torture, Christ just ask to God forgive the sinners. This teach us a little of compassion in this world so full of hate and social diseases.The total critics of the jewish people are infounding of data.

The hateful attacks that Gibson had to endure, even to this day, because he dared to make this shining light among a sea of garbage that is Hollywood, is a tragedy.The fact also, that this film has not been recognized as the superb piece of art that it is by the various award groups is a travesty.Everything about this movie is powerful and moving and if it doesn't have an impact or an effect on you... your soul is dead.A magnificent achievement by Mel Gibson a true visionary and hero of our time.

This is the tenet of what I believe. I have seen it several times now. I cannot stop thinking about this film. It is very emotional and moving.

There is great sadness watching the sacrifice of Jesus, but at the same time a feeling of a second chance to live up to the blessing bestowed upon mankind.  I'm not sure why so many people are angry about this movie - no one was depicted in a derogatory light.  True, the high priests were Jewish - but the masses in the streets fighting and demanding Jesus' release were also Jewish.  It seems sad to me that a movie so filled with sacrifice and love could make people feel anything but humble. The saddest part of all is that despite the sacrifice of Jesus - not much has changed in the behavior of mankind - people see the truth and still try to destroy it.  I think that everyone should see this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
639,Slagathor,"Theologically suspect, certainly Anti-Semitic",2,29 February 2004,"The Passion of the Christ was about as redemptive as an old re-run of I Dream of Genie, as well-acted as one of the Police Academy Films and slightly less sensitive than Triumph of the Will.The problems are so manifest and many that it would be difficult if not impossible to run through them all in a logical manner, so I will attempt to randomly address as many as I can in this short space.The script relied heavily on extra-scriptural sources, some from the apocrypha, some from medieval church tradition, and some from mystical tradition. For a film that desired to be as faithful as it could to the NT, it failed miserably, including far too many speculative scenes, especially regarding hasatan. Of course, one could raise the same criticism against the greatly superior Last Temptation of Christ, but that film never desired accuracy or fidelity to its source.Minor points? Bad Latin? Did they have no one on set who could correctly pronounce the vorld's most commonly spoken dead language? For shame! The linguistics were better in Quest for Fire and the Thirteenth Warrior.  Too many artistic liberties were taken with the text: paintings were staged, the archaeological record utterly disregarded and so on. Annoying but not a fatal flaw.The film was offensively anti-semitic. As a high church episcopalian and former professor of divinity, I found the film to be one of the more hateful lessons in blame that I have ever witnessed. The script attempts, rather unsuccessfully to place all of the blame on Caiaphas, utterly remove blame from Herod and from Pilate. A noble enough aim if the text can support such a reading, but it can't, and that's what makes the film anti-semitic. By removing the potential for blame from Judas, from Pilate, from Herod, and placing it entirely on Caiaphas (although with a half-hearted and condescending nod toward's Christ's self-sacrifice), the film steers its audience towards one reading: Caiaphas is to blame. Ordinarily this wouldn't be that problematic, except that Caiaphas is used by the script to symbolically embody ALL Jews in Jerusalem. The one or two staged walk-ons from the stations of the cross notwithstanding, every single Jew is depicted as hating and desiring Jesus' death and are embodied by Caiaphas. The blood guilt line, is clearly audible to anyone who not only knows Aramaic, but also who has read any version of the NT--there is a chunk of vile-sounding dialogue and a curious absence of sub-title.At least in Jaws, the script goes out of its way to defend sharks as amazing creatures and even shows the audience an innocent but potentially man-eating Tiger Shark. No such luck in this little slap in the face to Judaism; every single shark is a Great White, and all have sensed the bucketloads of blood. The blood by the way was nothing. The movie's violence is cartoonish and far less gruesome than early Peter Jackson films. You want violent, watch Schindler's List.The acting was terrible with one exception. Hristo Shopov was fantastic as Pilate, and was the only actor who apparently showed to work. He brought sensitivity and emotion to his role, compared to a collection of performances that would not of been well-received even in the Middle Ages in York at the real Passion Plays. The various Mary's were wooden and vague, and that's the best that can be said for them. The scenes with hasatan were powerfully and embarrasingly retarded. Likewise the stunned and idiotic use of slow-mo.I hated this film and am sorry that I gave any money to its producers. Granted, it wasn't as poorly made as Legally Blonde 2, but that's not saying very much.",The Passion of the Christ
640,jymcgr,The Passion - unsolicited review,10,26 February 2004,"By my most conservative estimate I have seen 2500+ movies in my lifetime. Among those I have seen some of the best and some of the worst movies ever made. In all of them I have never seen anything that matches the power and the magnitude of Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ."" For years the church has been asking how to reach a generation of people who are numb to the world around them, this movie is a step in the right direction. The showing we attended had people of all ages and walks of life. Among the crowd I heard gasps and audible sobbing as the story of Christ's passion unfolded on the screen. The images were intense and raw. The emotion of the story was accented by the savage brutality of the punishment received at the hands of the sinners he came to save, the crushing weight of the cross he carried, and the love that never left his eyes for a moment. All of this is compounded when you realize that as hard as this movie is to watch, it is still only a movie and the real life events that inspired it must have been more than most could bear to see. I was touched by the movie in a way that I can not describe. I have fallen in love with my Savior all over again. I hope that you will make time to see it. You will not regret it.",The Passion of the Christ
641,hesslop39,8 out of 10 stars,8,8 March 2004,"I saw the Passion of Christ on Friday.  It really is a very powerful movie.  This movie is violent, but the message is about love.  Jesus said in the movie ""Love everyone as I have loved you -- even your enemies!""   I just wish the movie would have shown more of Jesus' life -- but the movie is all about his death. The movie assumes you know who Jesus is, which most viewers probably do, but I think it would have been a more powerful movie if they showed why Jesus is wonderful and not just how he suffered.  They do show a few flashbacks, but the focus is how he suffered, and I think there is a good reason to show that too, but it is not the story of Jesus I would have told.  I also didn't like that they had to show a personification of Satan. I think there was enough evil in the film from the humans without having to also show Satan. Still a good movie that makes you think.  I give it 8 out of 10 stars.",The Passion of the Christ
642,zmarc,Missing a message of hope,7,26 February 2004,"This film is a brutal experience, a two-hour onslaught of torture and pain. If you are a Christian, it's a worthy experience as you understand the background and the meaning behind Christ's death. Unfortunately Mel doesn't show the way lives were changed because of Jesus' death. I would have liked to have it end with shots of various characters we meet in the film -- Malchus (the servant who's ear was cut off by Peter), Simon (the man who carried Jesus' cross), Pilot (the Roman govenor), etc. -- praying and being with family, showing us their lives have changed and will never be the same. That would have given some meaning to the death. As it is, all we see the is the brutal death, dramatically portrayed, without any of the positive consequences. It's sad instead of hopeful. It's still an amazing and moving film, but it could have been a masterpiece.",The Passion of the Christ
643,LadyKanerasoka,Intensely Powerful and Extremely Sad,10,17 December 2020,"Saying this movie is intense is DEFINITELY an understatement. Mel Gibson is an absolute genius who has created an amazing masterpiece, but also an extremely disturbing and sad one at that. Until I saw this movie, I hardly knew anything about Jesus's death, nor did I even know that he was arrested, brought to trial,, condemned, and even tortured. Seeing everything that happened to him being done was so very disturbing, especially due to the blood and gore that's shown throughout the film pretty much nonstop. I just watched the film a second time and for both times I watched it, I was sobbing and shaking almost the entire time, I felt like I was going to throw up but didn't, I and I was so angry and clenched my fists so hard my knuckles turned white. But despite all this, the movie was extremely well done. There were actual lines/actions from the Bible in the film. The music was an epic combination of both classical angelical and Middle Eastern music. The makeup and visual effects were absolutely stunning. The acting was phenomenal and Jim Caviezel was absolutely flawless in his role as Jesus. If you haven't seen this movie, then I HIGHLY recommend it, regardless of whether or not you're a person of faith.",The Passion of the Christ

Focusing on the last few hours of Jesus Christ, through to being tortured, then executed, we can feel the emotinally charged events that happened 2000 years ago; plus, the feelings of him, and his family.The film tells the story, passed down through hundreds of years in full, maximum detail showing the scenes to be particularly harrowing. Although this, most would agree in saying this is necessary as this endowers the viewer to experience a very moving few hours, in which, the same for Jesus, and his family in the last few hours of his life!!Personally, I was very impressed with this film, and I hope it continues to receive good reviews in the future.Score: 7.8/10",The Passion of the Christ
645,elrond5000,No middle ground,10,27 February 2004,"The film leaves you with a choice in the end.  Either this man was a total lunatic for allowing himself to be tortured to death, or he truly was the son of God. Take your pick, but don't deceive yourself; you can't just say he was a nice guy with moral teachings.Gibson has succeeded in making a movie that will bring about such discussion and in challenging the individual viewer's own beliefs.  I also admire this movie on an artistic level as it captures the imagination and draws one's attention despite knowing the story.Spoiler: There is flashback scene in which Jesus is building a table and he ends up joking around with his mother Mary.  I found that part especially touching because it humanized him and made the torture scenes that much more difficult to take.",The Passion of the Christ
646,MicktheGreat,As potent a movie as I have ever seen...,9,30 March 2004,"I have heard from many people that for one to write a credible and efficient criticism of any medium, he/she must be able to observe the medium objectively (or at least somewhat objectively). I think that it is necessary for me to first say that I don't feel as if I can review this movie objectively. I am a Christian and have been one for some time. I grew up knowing the story of Jesus and seeing rather bland interpretations of that story but ""Passion"" is the first interpretation that has been intensely moving to me, altogether horrifying, and relatively accurate of the Biblical text.On terms of cinema, Mel Gibson does a brilliant job with constructing this movie in terms of camera usage. The scenes are shot wonderfully. Likewise, I was glad with his decision to use Latin and Aramaic in the movie rather than English. Plus, the actors have the look of people who belonged to that particular culture.Some may complain about Gibson's adding in of events that are taken from church tradition and not necessarily from the text. I am not Catholic and am unaware of many Catholic tradition regarding the crucifixion; however, I was not bothered overall with Gibson's vision and usage of tradition in the portrayal.Other criticisms are mentioned regarding that the movie focuses entirely on the crucifixion and not much on the resurrection or the teachings of Jesus. In my opinion, I don't think this is an issue. Gibson set out to make a movie portraying the passion of Christ specifically in the event of the crucifixion. In that sense, that is exactly what he does.The most popular criticism is that the movie could be mistaken as Anti-Semitic. I completely disagree with this criticism. True, the film portrays many Jewish leaders as treacherous and many Roman soldiers as bloodthirsty. However, I DO NOT feel that the message behind the film (or the Bible) is that the Jews are bad people. Rather the important message is that Jesus was betrayed by everyone around him. Betrayed by his closest friends (Peter's denial, John's fleeing, Judas, etc.), betrayed by his kinsman (the Jewish officials), and betrayed by strangers (the Romans).Ultimately, I gave this movie a 9/10. Why not a 10? Because I don't know if I will ever want to see the ""Passion"" again. That's how powerful it was to me. Regardless of where you stand on Christianity, Gibson, or religion in general, I feel that this is an extremely important movie to view for its artistic and thematic messages.9 out of 10",The Passion of the Christ
647,MissDev,Flawed Interpretation - Read the Bible Instead,1,3 February 2006,"When I first heard about Mel Gibson's concept for The Passion of the Christ, I was intrigued. I followed the production of the film - read every article I could get my hands on. Then the anger and propaganda (from all sides) started flying. There were messages of hatred for one viewpoint or another - no one could get along because of this movie. I went and saw it when it came out. The best way I can put it is in the words of an 11 year old whose parents brought her to see it - ""when I am in church, Jesus makes me feel warm and loved and good. When I saw this movie I felt scared and angry and sad. And that's not how Jesus would want me to feel."" It would be lovely if someone would make a film about Jesus' TEACHINGS - his greatest legacy to the world and what will truly ""save"" people. If I was a filmmaker, I'd do it, but I'm not.I guess what I'm saying is - don't see this film expecting the Jesus from the Bible. See this movie for an interesting interpretation of the end of Jesus' life and the violence surrounding it. Let me be clear that I do not deny the horrific nature of his death - but it is not the most important part of his life - and I think it's a disservice to focus on it. Be aware that this film is COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR A YOUNGER AUDIENCE. The violence depicted in it is so horrific that it very well could give children nightmares. More importantly, just as the little girl said, you walk away with a feeling of fear and anger - and children should not be laden with those emotions.All-in-all I would not recommend this movie. Only see it as an addition to your religious studies - not as hope for some Hollywood-laced ""epiphany.""",The Passion of the Christ

I attended a Catholic school for a few years in high school. This gave me plenty of opportunity to discuss the bible and it's teachings.The movie was horrible trash. I've always disliked violence shown in movies and this one showed nothing but violence. Many don't want violence shown in movies due to a basic understanding that it desensitizes people to it.I'd hoped it might dwell more on the teachings of Jesus. The tolerance, love and forgiveness. A great opportunity was missed to teach the world about the goodness of Christianity. But, instead, we showed people new methods of torture. The entire message of the movie is missed due to the horror of the violence.What does deserve an award was the brilliant marketing strategy! Gibsons' marketing was great and classes can be taught about his techniques.With all the violence in the world, we need movies showing the goodness of the various religions. We need a series of religions of the world that educate others. We need better understanding of our differences in order to live together peacefully.

649,stevenlshoup,"""See Mother? I Make All Things New.""",10,15 April 2006,"This is the last day of the life of Jesus of Nazareth. Even atheists know this one by heart.In all of the ballyhoo, hub-bub, and ethnic finger pointing prior to and after this film's release, I'm convinced that the core of Mel Gibson's message of this picture got buried: We are unable to grasp what is meant by ""Jesus suffered for our sins"" and it waters down our faith. We have had our image of ""suffering"" psycho-babbled, humanized, compassion-ized, rehabilitized, and anesthetized beyond our 21st century comprehension.Prior to Gibson's film, Hollywood was of no help with this either. They gave us a ""suffering"" for Jesus that amounted to a roughing up, bloody nose, and smudge or two on his ornate costume. Afraid that they might offend Christians (prior to a change of heart whereby they actively mock Christian faith) they white-washed the final 24 hours of Christ's corporeal life for the sake of family entertainment.Mel Gibson has stepped up to the plate, researched his history very well indeed, and shown us exactly how the ancient Romans dealt with that which they deemed improper, criminal, immoral (which had a lot of wiggle room in ancient Rome) or that which they out and out feared and Caesar feared this lone Jew who was claiming minions for followers by telling them that he was a ""king."" Caesar wasn't about to be dethroned, which is how he interpreted Jesus' message. He relied upon the justice administered through his centurions and these centurions were wicked in battle and vicious beyond decency in their punishments. Rome had reached an uneasy but workable truce with the huge Jewish following within the regions they now owned and dominated. They had no love for the Jews, but tolerated them because they had to and visa-versa.Gibson also captured the accuracy of the Jewish leadership of that age. The Sanhedrin (Jewish Council) had by this time corrupted service into personal power and standing for the Pharisees and Scribes (Hmm, sounds like a certain federal government I know of) and a renegade rabbi was turning the people away from them and to his view of Faith and Belief not by ones and twos, but by hundreds and hundreds. These power-mongers of the Sanhedrin weren't about to let this stand and they used every bit of guile, cunning, and semantics at their fingertips to trap this rebel. But this rebel was untrappable. And so to this crew it became ""The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Friend"" and colluded with the Roman Empire to destroy one man both powers feared dearly.The chess game between Rome and The Sanhedrin over who takes ultimate responsibility for bringing the heretic to atonement is a clever parry-and-thrust of two powerful organizations. But Christ is aware that they are playing into God's hands, where Jesus is already prepared for what he knows lies ahead for him. He has seen Roman cruelty. He knows he will be exposed to it. He knows He must be. It is the will of his Father and no one else.Many have criticized the graphic violence in this picture, but it is imperative that Christ's ordeal be graphically displayed. Only by this can we understand the full measure of His suffering. Only by this can we understand and have revealed to us what we see in the final moments of this film and what awaits us as good and faithful servants. Only by this can we know without question that Jesus IS the Messiah. Only by this can the honest impact of Revealed Truth of the Word of God be verified. Anything less is disingenuous.Every aspect of this picture technically is impressive all around. Mel selected his department heads with great care here and it shows. Cinematography, art direction, set direction, costumes, lighting, props, score, performers  they all work together like a well-oiled machine. He has recreated the ancient Holy Land as it was. This film is made with a distinct ""seasoning"" of Catholicism, but it doesn't detract from the story for Protestants. Gibson does take some directorial embellishments not found in his source material: Satan's repeated visits; the snake in the Garden of Gethsemane; the raven and the crucified convict; Judas' delusions of children as demons, and such, but they don't work against the story. He also kept the dialog in ancient tongues. Not a word of English is spoken and it works! Jim Caviezel is a more Semitic-looking Jesus and gives a simple-stated, vulnerable, and moving performance. Hristo Naumov Shopov is a standout as Pilate, nicely played is Simon of Cyrene who is forced to help Christ carry his cross and Jarreth Merz is to be highly complimented here. There is not a sour note in any performance. Wisely, Gibson chose Non-name actors for the roles so that no ""star"" would outshine his/her performance.For me two things struck me like a speeding locomotive: The aerial view of the crucifixion and Christ's near final words. In the former we watch until we realize that we are seeing the scene through a single rain-drop but as the drop falls, we become conscious we are watching a son's death through the eyes of his own Father. I was thunder-struck.All my life I'd read and heard Jesus proclaiming from the cross, ""It is finished."" However, Gibson translates that phrase into, ""It is accomplished"" and the impact of that spoken insight was cathartic for me. I haven't been the same since.This is NOT a picture you enjoy or are entertained by. Believers are either moved to the point of being more deeply imbued in their faith or they're repulsed by the violence. Agnostics and Atheists can watch this film as a different kind of political thriller. There is no in between.",The Passion of the Christ

I find it tedious to read subtitles because your eyes focus away from the visual effects of the movie too often.But in both cases, my premature disappointments were wrong. This is one powerful film. Mel didn't need to be a character in this movie to make it great. And the subtitles were so few, that the movie was spoken through the eyes of all of the characters.My children, ages 10 and 12, badgered me to take them to see this movie. At first I was reluctant because of the R' rating. But they have seen the epic violence in the Lord of the Rings' movies, so I figured they may be prepared.What I found was... I wasn't prepared... and neither was my wife. I didn't know whether to watch the thrashing or look away. I found myself in apology for not realizing what cruelty Jesus surrendered himself to. My wife and I both wept. And yet, our children watched intensely.At one moment during the whipping, I was ready to yell out, `STOP IT!!!' There was a sensation that I was standing in the crowd, feeling helpless. And I wanted the torture to stop. I put my head down and told my sniffling wife I couldn't take it anymore. And yet, we still didn't reach the point where they nailed Jesus to the cross. The brutality at times was horrific... especially when the studded scourge dug into Jesus' ribcage. I needed it to stop.The crucifixion was spine-chilling. It was more than the eyes could tolerate. When the credits started rolling at the end of the movie, I felt relieved. I was relieved to see that Jesus' suffering was over. I would have preferred to have seen more of His resurrection. But it's not needed. I just needed more time to wipe my eyes, reflect, and rethink my life.The kids were shell-shocked. My 10-year old turned to me and said it was really scary. And those were the only words spoken as we walked in somber silence to the car.Everything about this movie turns you inside-out. The movie was impeccably filmed. I hope I never forget what I saw for I don't think I can ever watch this brutality again.",The Passion of the Christ
651,pinback-3,"Deep Wounds, Shallow Movie",6,3 March 2004,"The brief scenes involving Jesus in William Wyler's ""Ben Hur"" moved meto tears. Nothing in Mel Gibson's movie had anywhere near that impact.Why?This is a well-made movie, exceptionally well acted. The story has beenaccurately described as ""the greatest story ever told"", so theingredients of a great movie are bound to be there. And the structuringof the story, with flashbacks to the Last Supper during the crucifixionlest we miss the point that the story is one not of man's inhumanity toman, but of one man's love of all humanity, is well-handled.But this is not the realistic portrayal of Christ's last day which itpurports to be. If any man had actually been treated as brutally asJesus is in this movie, he would have been dead long before he reachedthe cross. We have become numbed to cinematic violence. Unless there aregouts of spurting blood and flesh hanging in strips, we feel that it isnot worthy of our attention. Real life violence, is, I'm sure, far lessspectacular, but far more disturbing, simply because it is real. Toconvey this sense of reality is no doubt extremely difficult. It takesthe talent of an artist, not just a movie-maker. It requires subtlety.What takes place just off screen is usually far more powerful anddisturbing than what we see.The argument that the explicitness of the depictions of violence in thisfilm are necessary in order to convey the reality of what Jesus sufferedis nonsense. Rather the very explicitness dilutes the impact. And itdistances us to what is happening to Jesus. We see not a man, but ableeding side of beef. Often the violence in this film, particularly inthe slow motion sequences, appears to be used for its sheer visceralentertainment value, much as Sam Peckinpah used such scenes in hisfilms.There have been many depictions of the crucifixion in previous movies.This is the goriest, no doubt. But if explicit depictions of violencewere what made for great art, then ""Last House on the Left"" would be abetter picture than ""The Virgin Spring"".The film also lacks subtlety in its depictions of the supernatural. (Asa devout anti-supernaturalist, I admit to some bias here, butnevertheless even something unreal can be depicted with subtlety.) An early scene in which Jesus reattaches a Roman soldier's ear after oneof his disciples cuts it off is unintentionally quite funny. And thefilm occasionally resorts to scenes of the devil and demonic childrenwhich would not look out of place in a cheesy Italian rip-off of ""TheExorcist"".So much of our response to a movie is a reflection of what we bring toit. When the subject is the life of Christ, this couldn't be more true.A great artist will dip into this deep well of personal religiousassociations which we all carry with us, and our response will be deeperand more personal because of what we have brought to the process.Take that scene in ""Ben-Hur"" when Jesus gives Ben-Hur a drink of water.What could be a more powerful symbol of what Jesus meant to the worldthan a drink of water to a thirsty man? How much more meaningful andmoving then is this scene than any scene of a nail going through Jesus'hand in close-up.Religion, however, like all things, is a matter of personal taste.Clearly this film has struck a chord with many viewers for whom watchingit is a profoundly cathartic experience. The fact that I am not one ofthem doesn't stop me from wondering if, for some reason, the world maynot have a need at the moment to relive the crucifixion in such graphicdetail. Why this should be, I don't know, but far be it from me to tryto dissuade others from seeing a movie that could work for them.",The Passion of the Christ

It fails on all levels.As a MOVIE - Missing all elements of a well made movie. Meandering, incoherent storyline and superficial, stereotyped characters. Really just an excuse to inflict 2 hours worth of torture and brutality and make us feel sympathy for an unfounded, undeveloped character named Jesus. Utterly ridiculous storyline if you watch it objectively. As a SOCIAL PHENOMENON - A pure illustration of the rampant hypocrisy and ridiculous fiction that is organized religion. Churches truck our children into theaters to be asssaulted by this delusional drivel redressed as fact, then they go write letters to congress about violence on television and the offensive nature of Janet Jackson's boob. Takes blatant biographical liberties and resorts to rampant revisionist history in order to justify the silly story of Jesus as foundation for the Catholic Church. A stack of lies and loose historical fiction does not make an entertaining movie, it merely inflicts perpetual pain and prejudice on the public.Christianity has no cause for celebration, for it has caused countless wars, propagated intolerance and hatred, introduced the concept of guilt, taught people to hand over free will to a mythical man in the sky.

653,susy-7,"Powerful, beautiful, challenging, uplifting...and powerful again.",10,1 March 2004,"I went into this movie with as open a mind as possible, but honestly expected to be assaulted with violence, and even if I was moved, I expected (based on reviews) that the ""violence"" would overwhelm just about every other reaction.  I thought I would cry and endure and come out feeling drained, guilty and sad.  IT WAS NOT AS I EXPECTED.  The violence I had been prepared for was not what I had heard it was--I was not overwhelmed by the violent images, nor did I think the torture and violence done to Jesus was overwrought/overdone.  And while I DID cry throughout the movie, what I found was I came out of the movie feeling--not profoundly sad, but rather uplifted and blessed.  I felt a joy that completely took ahold of me. I wanted to hug the audience members and bless them and ask for their blessings and prayers.  For believers, this is a must-see movie.  For Catholics such as myself, all I can say is that this will ""make real"" our faith to you, and illuminate the most important week in the liturgical calendar, i.e. the Holy Week. From a secular standpoint, Mel Gibson's movie is artistically stunning and the cinematography is as great as you have heard.  The imagery that Gibson used will stay in my mind the rest of my life--the Bergman-esque Satan is probably the creepiest, most effective visualizations of evil ever.  The power of that one image is alone enough to render this film important and groundbreaking.I'd like to review this film and offer insights into from a non-religious standpoint for those of you who may be non-believers but are nevertheless interested in seeing this film to find out what all the fuss is about. However, I find that outside of the few comments I made above, I can only relate to the film on a spiritual level because for me it was a life-altering moment of faith for which I am eternally grateful to the filmmaker.I hope that as many people as possible see and experience The Passion of the Christ.",The Passion of the Christ

I was most disturbed at the very large number of children (ages 8-12) that were in the theater as well. The level of violence approaches Saving Private Ryan levels and is not suitable for children. The films narrative stayed very close to the bible as just about every reviewer has repeated, but this piece is very unbalancing. The death of the man known as Jesus is permanently recorded here for history to witness, but sadly I think that it does great disservice to the effort to communicate what he did in life. Perhaps it is just me, but focusing so clearly on the death of Jesus does lasting damage to the understanding of what Jesus stood for in the few years that he walked the paths of the Holy Land. Like remembering a deceased relative, you would prefer to remember only their life and not how they died.",The Passion of the Christ

This was an emotional roller coaster that was done in a non-contrived way. It's also the first subtitled movie I ever watched where I felt just as much emotion from the text as I did the actors.

658,chucksnow5,The real reason they dislike it.,10,25 February 2004,"When I was in the Marines I was always asked ""What religion are you?"" so when I died my body would be treated with the respect in accordance with my religion. I found it amusing that as long as I was alive my Leaders would crap on me, but as soon as I was killed they would treat me with respect. So I always answered half jokingly ""Catholic...twice a year, Christmas and Easter.""I was a Catholic in name only. The Pedophile crisis in my church drove me even farther away. The horrors of 9-11 brought me skittishly, tentatively, back. While I never renounced my religion, I also didn't attend Mass regularly. I just felt disconnected to it.This movie finally made me understand something my own Church couldn't; that Christ was a human being, and suffered as a human being would suffer, and that he wasn't just 'crucified died and was buried' as my Church would quickly gloss over during prayers.There was so much more physical pain and sacrifice in Christ's short life I hadn't bothered to consider, or recognize. This movie made me feel passion about a religion I'd been resenting all my life. (At times with good reason -due to the actions of a well costumed few.)Contrary to what the media has been hyping, I couldn't find any reason in the film to 'hate' or 'blame' Jewish people for Christ's suffering. It was not the act of Jews, but the will of God that caused Christ to die on the Cross. Anyone of any race could have been used as God's tool to accomplish the sacrificeI find the suggestion that people will become Anti-Semetic after viewing it as insulting and overheated. I honestly hope lots more people feel the same way after seeing it.I don't think watching this film will promote Anti-Semitism anymore than watching a film about Pearl Harbor would promote Anti-Japanism, or watching a film about Hiroshima would promote Anti-Americanism.However, this film WILL energize Catholics and Christians everywhere. It will bring them back to their faith, to their families, and their churches. It will cause many formerly disaffected people like me to become re-energized about their religion. Or at least reconsider.When that happens, people will begin to realize the Judeo-Christian Ethic of forgiveness and ""live and let live"" are superior to Islam, and agnosticism. People will return to the traditional American lifestyle.People will want the America they grew up in. One Mother, One Father. A family. The sanctity of life at it's CONCEPTION.It's not Anti-Semitism the powerful bigmouths fear, it's the idea that people will drive their families back to their religion, be it Jewish or Christian, and get between their Children and MTV anyway they can. It's the idea that Parents might now get between their Children and Hollywood any way they can. It's the idea that Catholics and Christians might rise up and become a single voting block. That's what the hype and fear mongering is about.That having been said, this is a violent movie, it's NOT FOR CHILDREN. The violence is graphic and portrayed in such away that if you're not repelled by it, then you've got serious problems. No cartoon 'torque' or 'fast and the furious' pseudo-violence here. But it is this very violence that works on you. The violence and suffering of a human being is the point of the film.Love it or hate it, It's a film for the ages. By risking 30 PLUS Million of his own money, Mel Gibson has gone from Hollywood Tough Guy Heartthrob and Actor to Daring Tough Guy and possibly Genius visionary and director.I say well Done Mel.

659,c007ty,"Films are films, but expierences are expierences.",10,28 February 2004,"Films are films, but expierences are expierences. I wasn't watching a film last night, at least that's not what it felt like. What I was watching seemed like reality. I felt like I was actually there, seeing these events taking place. I was there in the crowd when they yelled, ""Crucify Him!"". I was in front of him when they flogged Him as many times as the drunken Roman guards wanted. I was crying alongside Jesus when He was nailed to that cross. And I was a witness to his ressurrection. What I was watching was real to me, a historical event turned to current times. If it was a film, I will proclaim as the greatest and most important movie ever made. The story starts off in the garden of Gethsemene (spell?), where Jesus is being Tempted by the devil, who is literally THE DEVIL, and I'm not joking either. Jesus, as lot of people know, was born a man, but He was the Son of God, our Savior and Messiah. Later, he's captured and sent to the Jewish politicians where they judge His own ethics and His, what they called, blasphemous remarks. Soon there after, they take Him to the Romans where Pontious Pilate, a monster who killed alot of people, was actually believing that what Jesus was saying was true. We can see he's believing something from it. But he is a weak man, and he defiles his belief because he's scared he'll have an outcry on his hands. So, he sends him to be punished and let go. At this time, I had felt like I was with Jesus and was waiting for them to flog me. It's hard to see this happen and you want to help Him out. But nevertheless, they flog him so much that it was impossible for the wounds to heal at all if given a chance. The voilence doesn't just seem real, but if I didn't know better, I would think it was real. I don't know how they did it, but the realism affected me, so much. This was about the time I was building up in tears, but nothing was coming out yet. Later, Pontious Pilate, after an outburst from the Jews for Jesus to get killed, sends Jesus to be crucified.The tears ran from my eyes when they started to nail His hands to the cross. It turned out to be one of the most powerful scenes in the film.
But when He gave up His spirit I shed no tear. I felt glad; I felt joyful that it was finished and that our sins were forgiven. The final shot of the film is a confirmation of belief in which Jesus comes out of the tomb.I can't tell you how much this movie means to me. To say this can't change lives is foolish, because it's already doing that to me even though I'm a Christian. There's really no doubt in my mind God was speaking to Mel Gibson during production of this masterpiece because everything is so God inspired. I extremely recommend this movie for those searching for the truth. Yes, the movie takes previlagies in creativity. Many scenes where the devil shows up tells us that. Yet, this would actually seem right, the devil showing up throughout his whole crucifixion just to get Him to stop what He is doing. The earthquake after He dies is so powerful here that you are so sure it is God. I will not see this movie again until a long time. Maybe way after it is released on DVD. Why? Because it won't have the same affect on me as it has already done. I suggest everyone to see this, because you never know what kind of feelings you will take away from this until you tried.If it was a movie: ***** out of *****",The Passion of the Christ
660,alvintostig,Of Two Minds,8,25 February 2004,"Having seen this movie, I decided to wait for a few hours to digest it and see if my opinion changed.  After that time, I am more convinced it is a movie is flawless in its single-mindedness, its technical craft, and in its acting, but there are a couple of problems with the film.
Its violence is realistic and gut-wrenching, as many have said before. For a time this shock works towards its purpose, and you flinch at every blow. As the movie wears on, however, its relentlessness begins to de-humanize the sacrifice of its main character.As I'm writing this review, I find myself trying to do so without any sort of revelation of my own personal beliefs, and it is difficult.  If this were any other character besides Jesus, I'd be simply complaining that I didn't identify or feel any sympathy with the main character, and, consequentially, the suffering and the sacrifice's impact are lessened, and the movie suffers for it.I speculate that Gibson was not interested in humanizing Jesus, though. The film does not sermonize its message, but simply documents it. If this is what Gibson intended to do, then he succeded with aplomb.And though this review seems negative, I dont' intend it to be.  I rated this film 8 out of 10 stars, and stick by it.  It is beautiful, though painful, to watch.  It is moving and, in its purpose, it succeeds.  I walked into the movie expecting to be blown away, and wasn't, but I was still intrigued, and its made me talk to others and think about my own faith.

I am hardened and I will not cry if I watch it. I turned out to be right, but I was MOVED by the movie in every way. the part that really made me think: how could they do that? was when Mary held Jesus in her arms and just looked at the camera for maybe a minute strait and was silent... I don't know why, but it did. I had to literally scream out words like STOP! and that's sickening! just because it was realistic; it was like I was really there watching him suffer. I DO recommend that you don't eat popcorn at this movie because of 2 reasons. #1: it is disrespectful to watch someone get whipped, burned, impaled, and suffer while eating popcorn. (you act as if you like to watch him die) #2: you won't like the aftermath of eating popcorn while his stomach is hanging out... you should hide the kiddies while watching (even though I'm 12) because of it's brutality, and horrific images. though I didn't know how to describe it. I REALLY couldn't say i had FUN watching it... I shouldn't say I enjoyed it. I can't describe it. it was powerfully moving. when I went to see it in theaters I came out shocked. It was a good movie though. I found a gang of people sitting down and smoking. I told them that smoking was illegal in the theater. they didn't respond. I asked them why they were there. one of them told me: we're here to see dawn of the dead. though they didn't have any money. I told them I would give them money to get them to see the passion of the Christ. they didn't except. seeing it in the theaters is probably the best way to watch it.

663,diana-1,"Gripping, moving, authentic",9,11 April 2012,"Gripping, moving, and authentic, Gibson's ""Passion"" is the best Jesus movie ever. Unlike earlier, more ""tasteful"" versions, which unfold so slowly they make their subject matter boring, ""Passion"" gets right to the point. The crucifixion is the heart of Jesus's mission, without which our redemption could not happen. Gibson focuses on that. The horrifying violence and rivers of blood are hard to look at, but that, too, is the point, and the way these things are presented--the colors, the camera angles, the flashbacks--find beauty and meaning amid the gore.Besides bringing the New Testament's heroes to life, Gibson does a great job of presenting its villains. Judas comes off believably as someone who immediately repents of betraying Jesus. He throws his blood money of silver coins back at the priests and runs away from them, but things spiral downhill from there. Soon Judas has attracted a crowd of nasty urchins who chase him through the desert, tormenting him. When they finally disappear he finds himself sitting on the dirt next to a dead donkey swarming with maggots. His ensuing suicide feels completely inevitable. The devil keeps popping up all through the film, represented by a skulking, shrouded figure in the background. Near the end we see the devil revealed in his true element--a parched, cracked wasteland littered with bones. He's sitting on that ground, raging, and the camera looks down at him and rises away as fast as possible, just as we would do given the chance.All the characters are portrayed by little-known actors who look just right.

So I was really disappointed when I heard that it was out in theatres in the US. But, they already had pirated copies of it out over there, so yes, I picked one up, and viewed it later that day after I got off work. And, after watching it, I was totally speechless and teary eyed. The emotion that this film gives you is totally off the chart. And if you don't feel anything, I don't think your living. How could you not?? Seeing what happened to our Lord Jesus Christ. Those horrific cruel acts done to him.People say the violence is gratuitous and over the top, and its a bloodfest, yadda, yadda, yadda. Come on people!!!! WAKE UP!!!!!! Jesus's death wasn't pretty!!!!!!!!! It was exactly like this film depicted it. Just read the Bible and you will know. This film is entirley accurate on the Gospels. And all aspects of this film are outstanding. The acting, directing, music, etc. EVERYTHING!!!!!!

Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more love, faith, hope and forgiveness."" amen, pal. but does one need to bleed all over the screen to prove that love, hope, faith and forgiveness are important in our lives? who exactly has gone nuts? i am not so sure about that.don't get me wrong, the passion of Christ is something that always gave me a lot to think even when just looking at the paintings in churches. but where i come from, you don't need to spell it all out, people don't need that to get it. the paintings leave enough room for love, hope, faith and forgiveness - this movie simply does not.a while ago i came across some statements about parents who actually took their kids (!) to see this movie in order to make them appreciate the ultimate sacrifice Jesus made for us. educationally a smart move. maybe the world has gone nuts. at least a part of it. we could all use a little less cruelty in our entertainment industry.",The Passion of the Christ

670,Groovey,"Striking, vivid, unbearably painful, and not to be missed.",10,24 March 2004,"This film engraves the core story of one of the world's great religions in exquisite detail.  Irrespective of one's beliefs, the human suffering depicted cannot be watched without compassion, yet it is well worth the effort.   Christianity has had great impact upon the modern world, and all who would understand this world must understand Christianity, even if they don't share its tenets.The story begins with Jesus praying in the garden, and ends with the resurrection.  It is accurate to the Bible, with material filled in from tradition with a little dramatic license -- but believable and consistent with Biblical text.SPOILERS MAY FOLLOWThe realism is staggering.  The film is in Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, with subtitles.  While I don't speak any of those languages, I understood enough of each to realize that they were authentic and close enough to accurate as not to matter.When Pilate questions Jesus, he does so in Aramaic, and Jesus answers in Aramaic.  When Pilate is shaken by Jesus' responses, he unthinkingly switches to Latin, and Jesus then replies in Latin -- a language which no Jewish carpenter would have known.   A background detail that no one would pick up on unless they had some familiarity with the languages, it points again to Jesus' divinity.  Similarly, when Aramaic arguments are interlaced with Hebrew quotes and ritual, the languages are distinct.You may not think you would care, but it brings a vividness and reality into the story that cannot be denied.  Each language has a different feel, carried into the portrayal of the characters.  Even if English is your only language, it matters.
Many have objected to the level of suffering displayed, yet differences between this picture and vastly more violent movies (such as all the Terminator movies, for example) are worth examining.In most violent movies, the violence is unnecessarily grotesque, gratuitous, not compelled by the story, and clearly there to frighten and thrill the audience.  Bad guys suffer because the audience, having identified with the good guys, wants to see them suffer.  Good guys struggle because victory must be hard-won to be prized.  Gratuitous violence along the way makes the ride more ""fun"" for the audience.In The Passion of Christ, there is no gratuitous violence at all.   None. It is all compelled by the story, for it is portrayed exactly as it is described in the historical records available.   No one will walk away from this movie, point a toy gun (or a real one) at another, and say, ""Make my day.""  No one will identify with the bad guys and play, ""let's crucify him."" No one -- other than the genuinely sick -- will be thrilled by the violence in this movie at all.Yet in this day of instant gratification, comfortable living, and compromised religion, this picture testifies to the cost of discipleship. No matter what your personal beliefs, the story of the crucifixion, as told in The Passion of Christ, is a dramatic story of commitment and love beyond anything else in human history.  It is well worth watching for this reason alone.The billions who do not consider themselves Christian in any sense should consider seeing this film as a means of understanding who Christians believe they are called to follow and be.  The millions who consider themselves Christians should all see this film as a means of understanding exactly the same thing.   We are all -- both Christians and non-Christians -- easily fooled into thinking Christianity has to do with acting a certain way, belonging to a particular group, or even living by a certain set of rules. According to Jesus, it is not about any of those things.  Rather, it is about his willingness to suffer and die for us, in our places. As this film so powerfully reminds us, Christianity is about Jesus, not about us. The portrayal of salvation in this film is artless, Biblical, and (mostly) unadorned by later interpretation.Those who think of themselves as Christians, yet don't want to face the discomfort seeing this film will undoubtedly bring, must ask themselves what the word Christian means, if it does not mean following the subject of this story.   After all, the primary interpretation is that we deserve what happened to Jesus, but he willingly took our punishment for us.  If we are unwilling to face the greatest sacrifice ever made for us, do we really want any part of him at all?  Is the cross, then, just a popular and convenient piece of ornamental jewelry, or is it something that represents a price paid for us, even a price we are willing to pay in return?One caveat: I agree with those who say that this film is not for children. Everyone is different, but it may not be wise to let children under the age of twelve or so see this film.Another thing this film has been criticized for is its supposed anti-Semitism.   I could not disagree more completely, and I suspect that opinion was written (or at least mentally formed) before the promulgator of it had even seen the film.   The High Priest is clearly an evil man, and he does incite the Jews to ask for Jesus to be crucified, but the individual Jews are represented very differently.  The most inflammatory quote from the Biblical text was deliberately kept out of the movie, to avoid misinterpretation of it as anti-Semitic.  The Jew who was pressed into carrying the cross for Jesus was shown to be a good Jew who nevertheless didn't know anything about Jesus.  He reacted to his circumstances with courage, reason, and compassion.In fact, *every* good character in the movie is a good Jew, with the single exception of Pilate's wife.The first few minutes illustrate its central message of love, as Jesus stops his tormentors as they are in the process of taking him away, so he can heal the ear of one of them.  The only miracle in the entire film (other than the resurrection,) it shows us Jesus' divinity and his commitment to love.Following Jesus is not about rules or creeds -- although rules and creeds are important, and were important to Jesus.  It is about the price paid for us.  It is about acknowledging he took the penalty we deserved.  It is about allowing ourselves to be loved enough to be forgiven, and then turning around to show that much love again to others.He walked that unbearably painful path for you and me.Don't miss this film.",The Passion of the Christ
671,svensson-2,See Lilja 4 ever instead,4,1 April 2004,"I say first: if you want to see christian movies see ""Lilja 4 ever"" and ""Dogville""! I will explain later. First: the film music is a ripoff of Peter Gabriels ""passion"".The question that comes in mind is why this film was made. It is not a drama, rather an epic story. We know what will happen, what is interesting is how it happened. But is what is interesting how many ribs of Jesus the imperial soldiers managed to expose? Is the interesting thing that the soldiers torturing Jesus were beast-like? It would have been better to make a drama, to first explain why Jesus is ""our guy"", simply because now the focus is on who are *not* our guys. This is not at the heart of christian ideology, to define the bad guys, neither in its secular form, nor in it's religious form. The second thing is the portrait of satan: this is really cheap kitsch. I do not think evil should be portrayed as Mel Gibson's fear of anything that is not easily cathegorised as male or female, normal or abnormal. Why is ""Lilja for (4) ever"" a more christian film? Well, because it shows exactly what people on a daily basis bear the cross and die for our sinful society. Maria Magdalena is abused and stoned to death every day, by all of us, as a culture. And in the fairy tale, as in Dogville, she will come back after her meeting with the Godfather to judge the living and the dead.",The Passion of the Christ
672,Robert_Wagner62,YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE,10,15 March 2004,"Perfect adaption of the gospels put to film. I saw this movie, knowing full well the story, and afterwards it left me numb. I've seen many stories of the life of Jesus Christ, but never did I know the punishment he went through in such detail, the scourging & the beatings. Some might say that the violence was too much, I say the violence was accurate and needed to be seen, how else can one realize what the Messiah did for us.I felt no bad feelings towards Jewish people before, during or after this film, It's completely historic that the Sanhedrin & the Pharisees wanted Jesus Crucified, so there was nothing new in the movie, but the Romans enjoyment of beating the Lord was something I hadn't witnessed until this movie.Great movie, must see, Christian, Muslim or Jew... Maybe the greatest film ever made... no, ""IS"" THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE.",The Passion of the Christ
673,spiritualwolf,"Christ for our violent, negative times",1,8 April 2004,"I watched the Passion of the Christ with some positive expectations - I have generally quite liked Mel Gibson, and the cast looks good, the investment sound - but was pretty bitterly disappointed by the end. The film was pretty much negative from beginning to end - it was violent, aggressive, angry, bitter and twisted. If this converts anyone to Christianity, it will convert them to a twisted and perverted form of Christianity - a Christianity for our warlike and negative times.Gibson seemed to focus pretty much entirely on the beatings and torture of Jesus, rather than really putting any emphasis on the message that Jesus was supposed to have brought. We got a momentary mention of 'who lives by the sword, dies by the sword', while the rest of the movie celebrated violence.The other thing that disappointed me was that it was a very poorly put together and inadequately edited movie - touches of third-rate horror, a sub- Bergmanesque devil figure, and a Barabbas that was the worst kind of parody. The number of times that Jesus fell over and crashed, in slow motion, into the dusty ground was almost laughable. Do it once. Do it twice to make the point, do it three times to emphasise it - but it must have been nine or ten times in all. The acting was generally poor, too - whoever the actor was who was playing John seemed to know only how to stand still, mouth slightly open, eyes wide and looking stupid. He held that pose throughout the movie, from beginning to end.One final point - it reminded me quite regularly of a far better film about Jesus.... the Life of Brian. A lot more blood, far fewer laughs, and quite a lot less deep.",The Passion of the Christ
674,metalhead7321,Don't listen to what others say....,10,10 March 2004,"Mel Gibson vision of Jesus Christ is flawless. The pacing, the use of color and dialogue are all beautiful well done. After the movie was over I forgot everything said about how negative and awful this film is. It's does not make fun of the Jewish faith at all. That's how it really happened and Mel did the right thing. The violence is very graphic and hard to take but its deeply moving. The flash backs of Jesus with Mary are tear jerking, The scene when they show Jesus as a child and with Mary, I doubt anyone could hold there tears back. This better win at the Academy Awards. It deserves best picture and best director at least! Does this movie have the power to change lives? Maybe. Does have the power to present an very powerful story? Yes. Mel Gibson didn't ruin his career, he just show that he's not afraid of others thoughts or Hollywood.The Passion Of The Christ...10 out of 10",The Passion of the Christ
675,Mannequin,"Good story, well acted... engaging - but violent! You don't have to be religious to appreciate it.",4,28 February 2004,"Possible Spoilers in 5th Paragraph:I really enjoyed The Passion of the Christ. I'm not a very religious person (although I was raised a Catholic); I don't attend church and I rarely pray. So when I went to see The Passion of the Christ on opening night, I was looking for two things:1. I wanted to know how true it was to the Bible.2. And I was curious how the movie would be from a critical standpoint, religious beliefs aside.When the film ended I had my answers. Clearly the movie follows the Bible very closely, even though it's been a few years since I've read it. I was glad that the movie didn't ""spin"" the story of Christ. It was a genuine interpretation, and it didn't come across like they were trying to ""convert"" the audience into believers. It felt like they were just telling a story, and I appreciate that.My second question was answered almost immediately after the movie began. The cinematography was beautiful, and the acting, superb. I was also pleased that the movie was entertaining. A movie of this nature risks being boring because of the stigma that's attached to Church & education. But it wasn't boring or slow, it was engaging the whole way through.My criticim of the film is this: The violence was necessary, but the duration of the violence was too much. They could have erased 20-30 minutes of violence and replaced it with story, perhaps starting the movie earlier in Jesus' life. I want to reiterate that the violence was necessary. I'm glad they showed the nails going into Christ's hands and the severe whippings because they show you the extent of the torture that Jesus went through. Even if you believe the story of Christ is pure nonsense, this was an important point to make because it qualifies Jesus' strength and faith in God.Overall, I was very happy with the movie. If you cast your religious beliefs aside, there are some very good things about it. If you're a critic such as myself, you'll be glad that The Passion of the Christ stays far, far away from the typical Hollywood Blockbuster bonanza. The acting was excellent, the cinematography was beautiful, the CGI was kept to a bare minimum and the story was good. It's filled with depth - unlike the typical Hollywood movies that you see today.I recommend this film to anyone who is serious about movies. You don't have to be religious to appreciate it.8 / 10",The Passion of the Christ
676,mmckaibab,"A truly ugly film full of gratuitous exploitation, Hollywood gloss. NOT as it was.",3,19 April 2004,"It's hard to know where to start with this one. While the film's anti-Semitism might have been toned down, it's hard to ignore Gibson's anti-Semitic marketing plan that hyped this thing.Essentially this film shows Gibson's love of gore tacked onto the Jesus story. As one other writer said, it's essentially the torture scene from ""Braveheart"" expanded to fill two hours. However, Gibson can't keep himself from applying the full Hollywood treatment to this as evidenced by the extended flogging scene. When the guards pick up the truly brutal instruments they demonstrate their power by chewing up a wooden table with them. Yet, after 10 minutes of flogging Jesus with the thing you just get a Hollywood make-up effect of hundreds of fine stripe-like wounds instead of the missing hunks of flesh the thing would actually have torn out. Not to mention you still have a live person when anyone flogged with those tools to that extent would have been very, very dead.Gibson was also clearly working from sources other than Scripture or history. He throws in every station of the cross (including many extra falls) even though most of them are extra-scriptural. And his decision to have the Romans speaking Latin belies true ignorance of the times; they would all have been speaking Greek. The devil never makes a scriptural appearance at any of the times Gibson throws her (verry interesting!) at us and just what was going on with all the horror flick creatures? Finally, Gibson falls into the trap of almost every literalist in choosing to ignore scriptural descriptions of the Risen Christ. In every post-Resurrection appearance even those closest to him in life do not recognize him in his post-Resurrection form. Yet Gibson shows us exactly the same form we've seen brutalized for the past couple of hours (and why is it his hand wounds are still there but everything else has healed up so nicely?) So, even though many other writers here continue to inaccurately quote the Pope (another one of Gibson's marketing ploys that the Vatican has denounced), this really was NOT ""as it was.""Finally, how anyone can see this as a ""beautiful"" film shows just how jaded we have all become. My Christology is clearly centuries away from Gibson's, but there's nothing at all ""beautiful"" in Christ's Passion separated as starkly as it is here from his life, teaching and Resurrection. Without a basic understanding of Christ's preaching of the coming of the Kingdom, his Passion makes no sense whatsoever.",The Passion of the Christ
677,metroidphazon4,a good movie but a little over exaggerated on the gore factor,8,14 November 2010,passion of the Christ is good but i question if the Romans were actually that gruesome in the movie. definitely not a family movie or a movie for people who hate gore.Its about the suffering Jesus felt as he was sentenced to death.this movie does teach valuable lessons bur I cant remember any.most of the movie is gore related but there are dramatic scenes like the little Satan children. pretty creepy if you ask me.if you are Christian you might like it but its more for the less sensitive.bottom line is if you can stand to gore you might like this movie.

678,danielmiller1985,Extremely Violent With A Great Plot That's Very Effective!,8,26 April 2004,"I decided to see 'The Passion of the Christ' with my mate at the cinema last night because I was really curious and a few of my mates said it was excellent, and it actually turned out to be very good. I really had no idea of what to expect, but I knew it would be very different from any other film I've ever seen. I was pleased that there were English subtitles throughout the film, but there wasn't even that much dialogue towards the end of the film, because of the torture inflicted on Jesus. But at the start we find out why Jesus is being executed, and the subtitles really helped me understand everything. The whole film overall looks really old, and Mel Gibson makes the mise-en-scene look really believable and realistic. It's very effective in making the characters and set look about two thousand years old. There has been talk that this is a very anti-Jewish film but I didn't think it was too anti-Jewish, except maybe for when the Jews demanded Jesus to be crucified and I could see if it was anti-Jewish, because I'm Jewish. I've seen a lot of disturbing scenes in films before, but the sort of torture given to Jesus is definitely one of the most effective, especially when the Romans whip his back with these utensils that shred and tear his flesh, and leave Jesus in a big pool of his own blood. It also looked extremely real when they bang in the nails into his wrists and feet onto the cross. I didn't expect as much whipping onto his back as the roman's did, it must have lasted about ten minutes, and towards the end it becomes repetitive, and no longer a shock. But I must congratulate Mel Gibson in directing just as well as he acted in: We Were Soldiers, Payback and Ransom. I can't wait for it to be released on DVD!!!",The Passion of the Christ
679,celluloidcity,Dodgy Re-telling of a great story.,1,19 April 2006,"Before The Passion of the Christ began in the theater, a trailer was played of a couple of B list Australian celebrities telling the audience that what you are about to see is true, and Jesus has changed the lives of these people and they hope it'll change your life too.The Passion of the Christ is NOT a documentary. It is NOT a fly-on-the-wall perfectly unbiased account of Jesus's last days. It is a piece of entertainment; scripted, acted, lit, and scored.Unfortunately, this film does not provide any glimpses into Christ's ""Passion"", why he died, for whom, what kind of man he was, his beliefs, feelings and teachings for humanity. It offers absolutely no insight into anything that Christ stood for. What a shame, because Christ is a character that no one could have dreamed up. A true one-of-a-kind God and man, Saviour, revolutionary, pacifist, humanist. A heartfelt, straight-up glimpse into his ideas would have been fantastic.All this film gives us is a blow-by-blow account of his arrest and execution. All the film is concerned with is filling the screen with as much bloody misery as possible, and doing it with such Hollywood pizazz; the overbearing Enya-style score, the endless close-ups of Mary's tearful face, the completely unnecessary 'tear from heaven' CGI effects (not to mention the Crow), the grinding, spitting, sick Roman's beating Jesus and of course the suffering Saviour.No one can argue that Jesus's death was a disgusting, horrible, terrifying event that probably was as bloody and awful as the film set. But the question needs to be asked, did this portrayal add up to great film-making? There did not seem to be any point at all in this film. Where was the human drama? Where was the conflicted conscience's? All we got was a stream of obvious symbols that are completely dramatic and constructed in every sense of the word. I cannot understand how people can be moved by this film, it was fake from start to finish.A huge disappointment.",The Passion of the Christ

So when i heard about this movie i came to the conclusion that this could possibly have some of those hard to find answers to my faltering faith in the gospels and their truth.This movie reminded me about what Jesus really done for me and it has already started to help me back to the path of righteousness. I can imagine some people have certain icky feelings toward seeing this movie. I suggest you get over it and submit to your faith and watch this movie. And i suggest you don't have in young children present while your attended this feature, because this movie contains some of the most graphic scenes ever shot for a movie.I never thought i would feel the way i felt while watching Jesus take the beatings he took. I cryed and i felt a pain i've never felt, I was for the first time in my ""so-called"" christan life actually beginning to understand what christ did for me and for all of us.Though i don't know what's in store for me now in my life, I realize that many changes must be made in order for me to live my life for Christ. So i will begin my journey and i look to the future with a new found hope, that if a person who was almost faithless can start to regain one's faith then maybe it's possible for anyone who's never read the bible to see this and it change their lives, i know it's helped me and still is.",The Passion of the Christ
681,I_am_RenegadeX,"Nice cinematography, but there's nothing new here. Pffft.",2,4 September 2004,"Am I ever disappointed! I just finished watching 'The Passion' on DVD (first weekend out), and while the cinematography was excellent (undoubtedly the best production effort ever to retell this story), I sat there for the most part bored, wondering what all the fuss & hype was about. This film is over-hyped, and Mel Gibson is a rich man because of it.The disappointment is my fault. What did I expect? I (& most likely most viwing the film) already know the story - Jesus is arrested, accused, not necessarily found guilty but sentenced by the people anyhow, beaten, then given a cross to drag up a hill where he is to be crucified. Once there he is nailed to the cross, and shortly thereafter, he dies. His body is taken down, put in a mausoleum, and the next morning, he is risen. End of story. That's it. If you didn't know the story before, now you do - no need to thank me, but I've just saved you 2 hours so you may watch another film, hopefully more entertaining or more thought-provoking than this one.Therein lies the problem - most of us will know the story already, but Gibson does not provide any supporting substance to the film. Save for the beating scene, which perhaps gives viewers more graphical insight into the pain & suffering that Jesus may have received than ever before attempted on film, what else is there? NOTHING! The same simple story has been recreated for film literally hundreds of times around the world in documentaries about the life of Christ. Folks, I'll say it again, there is absolutely nothing new here!Running time is a mind-numbing 127 minutes. 45 minutes would have sufficed. Instead, scenes drag on and on, and my remote's 'Display'-button (to see how much time was left) was beginning to show the signs of wear by the end of the movie.Possibly even more disappointing than the film itself- once the credits started to roll, I returned to the DVD's main menu hoping for some DVD-extras - perhaps a 'making of', perhaps interviews with Mel Gibson or some of the actors' thoughts about their roles as Jesus, Mary, Judas, Peter, Pontius Pilate, etc - I even entertained watching the film again this time with the director and/or actor's audio-commentary track. Sorry, no can do, this DVD has NO EXTRAS!!It was bad enough just watching 'The Passion' one time.. but why anyone would feel the need to 'OWN IT' as they keep telling us on the TV ads, I do not know. Mr Gibson might be devoutly religious, but he is also a smart businessman; the sheep have certainly proved themselves worthy to Mel's bank account.'The Passion' is not even a movie that has repeat-performance value!: you are not going to notice anything new upon repeat-viewing, there is nothing that repeat-viewing will help you 'understand', and there certainly is nothing that will make you grab your friends and say ""ooh, watch this part, it's my favourite scene!"". Own it? No. If you haven't seen it, don't even spend the money on the rental - instead find someone at work who has bought it and borrow it off them for the weekend for free.",The Passion of the Christ
682,4everard,Something to watch if you liked Gladiator,9,10 April 2007,"The Passion of the Christ, through extreme controversy of the press and religious sects, became one of the most popular films of 2004. Mel Gibson, successfully, uses Hollywood Techniques to make the classic story more imaginable to a ""new"" generation. We say this film is horrifically violent (it does have a 15-minute flagellation scene), however were we truly so unexpected? In 2000 Ridley Scott made a controversial film for its violence. Everyone I know has seen Gladiator at least twice, and that's because people ENJOY the story, probably because of the violence. Gladiator was panned by some critics for its violence but adored by the rest of the world for its epic story.It is the same for the Passion. Mel Gibson uses characters from the bible that you wouldn't usually see in the Cartoons about the Easter story. The Devil is done particularly well, neither looking, nor sounding like a man or a woman, it haunts the scene of suffering always in a black cloak.Another great thing about this film, which might be contradicted by some viewers, is the use of Aramaic and Latin as the spoken language. This obviously gives the film a sense of authenticity and it is quite strange to hear Latin being spoken in a probably very good Latin accent, (which is not too different from the modern Italian, accentuating the vowels) Of Course, being a mainstream Hollywood film, the effects are used almost pitch-perfectly. Early on in the film, the Devil torments Judas Iscariot for having betraying Jesus. You don't need to ask me how that turns out. I'll give you a clue: Rope. But the way the children are portrayed is excellent. The slight dream like distortions on their faces is very disturbing and frightening.All in all, I recommend this film to anyone who wishes to find an easier way to interpret the figure of Jesus Christ, in the style of Gladiator, and the happy hopeful ending is enough to make anyone convert immediately! A highly recommended film!",The Passion of the Christ

There is only one plot line and it's so dull I almost slept. I was lead to believe by so many reviews that the movie was gory and I thought that at the very least that I would get some shock value entertainment! Wrong.

Before I even saw this film, I kept hearing how this is a ""Anti-Jew"" film and how Hollywood wouldn't even touch this. How sad that we live in a world and try to rewrite history to fit our own needs. After viewing this film, I just shock my head in disbelief. No offense to those who were ""protesting"", due to the fact their saying it's ""Anti-Jew"", but sorry that's history.Where were all the White Americans (FYI - I'm a White Male) protesting when 'Dancing With Wolves' came out? Part of 'Dancing With Wolves' was how White Americans invaded on the American Indians soil, which too can be view as ""Anti-American/White"".Know why there was no protest from White Americans from America protesting? Reason being is because that's what really happened and if we learned anything from History, it's that we learn from our mistakes.Same goes for 'Schlinger's List'. It promotes ""Anti-Germans"" since they were killing Jews, but again there was no protest. I am pretty sure Jews would be quite offended if there were those protesting a great movie 'Schlinger's List' (yes I know misspelled), because they would want their history told.

686,Shannon38,Look What They Did!,9,12 September 2008,"The Man would make history. His life, death and resurrection would rock the world and challenge every man, woman and child for generations to come. His existence had been foretold since the beginning of Time. He would save the world from their sins. He would turn aside the wrath of Almighty God from all those who believed in His name and lived for Him. His name is Jesus Christ. Today, He's alive. But the world killed Him when He came because it did not know Him. Mel Gibson's controversial film about the final 12 hours of the life of Jesus of Nazareth has been met with one of two responses: extreme love or extreme hate. I have yet to meet anyone who was 50/50 about the film. This reviewer loved the film. I make it an annual event to watch it as a personal reminder of what Jesus Christ did for me nearly 2000 years ago. Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth is one filled with love, serenity and, yes, passion. You can see the love of Jesus for all people in his eyes when he speaks. You can see the hurt when he is treated unjustly. If Jim Caviezel did so awesome a job portraying Jesus, one can only imagine the Lord's expression when the events in this film actually happened a couple millennia ago. Based on the Gospels and Roman and Jewish history, Mel Gibson has crafted a well-executed account on what Jesus Christ went through on our behalf. Many complain the film is nothing but sheer gore. Yes, it is bloody, but if you look into Roman history and discovered what Roman scourging and crucifixion entailed, you'd find Gibson's film is bang on. He also made the right choice to display what happened how it happened instead of just putting a few scratch marks on Jesus and a robe splashed with red paint like other films have done. By seeing Jesus murdered as He was, the audience feels the impact of that day long ago. It forces them to pause and reflect. This film serves as a reminder for believers in Jesus, and serves, hopefully, as a touching account of the ultimate sacrifice from the ultimate Love to those who don't believe. It would take a terribly cold heart to not be moved by this film. Very recommended.",The Passion of the Christ
687,mzygel,What I learned from this movie,1,11 March 2004,"-	The Jews judged and condemned Christ; -	No Roman leader would execute him, so they insisted with Herod and Pilate;
-	The Romans look shocked when the Jews chose Barrabas (a murderer) over Jesus;-	The crucification was an idea of the Jews. The Romans again look shocked when the High Priest of the Jews tells them to crucify Jesus. Pilate tells them he will punish him severely, but not crucify him;-	Pilate never wanted to kill Jesus, but the Jews insisted and eventually convinced him. But he only killed him because he was afraid of a rebellion.I am a Jew, as was Jesus, and what I learned from this movie, and the reactions to it, is that a charismatic person easily influences people.Mel Gibson is an intelligent charismatic person, as was Adolph Hitler.

All of the elements of filmmaking were done well, and it was well put together. Mel Gibson is a good director in that respect, because he made things look realistic and presented the subject matter in a believable situation.That said, as a movie, it was just awful. It's half an hour of setup, then an hour and a half of Jesus getting his holy butt kicked by Romans. How is that a good movie? If this movie were about anybody else getting beaten, whipped, cut, tortured, and killed, I'm confident it would be universally panned by critics and viewers alike. If this movie never happened, and another acclaimed director used an entirely fictional character, had a little plot setup, and then extended torture scenes like this one, people wouldn't be giving it a high rating or saying it was inspirational or deep. That's why I say it's not good as a stand-alone movie.
For another example of historical films, look at 'Braveheart'. Even if it had nothing to do with history (and many will point out that much of it doesn't), it would've been a great movie anyway. But if 'The Passion' had nothing to do with history, people would've hated it.The fact is, Gibson took advantage of his target audience's willingness to have faith in Jesus, in order to make a lot of money (which he did). I am not a religious person but I have studied world religions all my life, and it seems to me that the Christian faith is supposed to be about loving and respecting one another, not making each other feel guilty and laying blame on other people, especially in the interest of moneymaking. This isn't entertaining cinema, it's borderline snuff. I have a strong stomach and the violence didn't really affect me, but maybe that's the reason why I can see this for what it really is: Pure shock value and capitalizing on people's faith.",The Passion of the Christ
690,vitalogst,Gore filled faith inspirer fails miserably,3,25 February 2004,"In Mel Gibson's ""Passion"" We are related the last twelve hours of Jesus Christ life, his trials and tribulations.  This film is supposed to be one of the most controversial ever.  However, I cannot, in my right mind, call this a film, because  most the characters are never properly introduced, almost no background is given on any of the characters, except for Christ, Pontious Pilate, the governor of wherever the story takes place (I was never quite sure) Judas, the betrayer, and Jesus's mother.  Apparently, Gibson decided that everyone already knows enough that everyone will understand what exactly is going on, and that he doesn't have to bother with setting who the characters are.  The cinematography and direction were atrocious, a cavalcade of slow motion shots and close-ups when there was absolutely no reason for them, it seemed only to break the momentum of the film.  On that note I'd like to point out that Mel Gibson did an excellent job of breaking down whatever forward momentum he might have built up by constantly seguing into flashbacks, which were altogether unneccisary, right at the climax of a sequence or scene. The majority of the film is the depection of Christ's torture before his cruxcifiction.  He is beaten, spit on, whipped, spiked, hung, torn, made to wear a crown of thorns and speared.  The unending amount of gore in this film is completely unjust and unwatchable.  If it was meant to inspire the audience to believe that Christ had undying belief in what he is, it failed, I found it only to inspire wretching, nausea, and disgust.  Throughout the film Christ was subject attack after unrelenting attack.  The reason why the story and the characters were never fully developed or understood was because eighty percent of the film is Christ's unabating punishment for his claims of Godhood. I found only one redemable quality of this film, Pontius Pilate, he was the only member of the cast that I thought performed well, and invoked sympathy, because of the position that he was put into.  He didn't want to kill what he believed to be an innocent, albeit crazy, man, however he knew that a wrong move would led to a riot, and a riot would lead to his death.Perhaps this movie will invoke people to find God or Christianity, I do not believe so, I think it will only lead people to question why someone of a religious nature would want to glorify hate and destruction.  Much like a television Christmas special that denounces Santa Claus until it is revealed in the end that it wasn't the kooky neighbor dressed in a big red suit, redeeming everything, Passion cannot tell a story of hate and pain and then redeem itself with Christ begging for the forgiveness of his enemies and a few poorly timed flashbacks to make this at all redeemable. This is Mel Gibsons' beliefs wrapped up in a bloody little package and rammed it down the throats of his audience.",The Passion of the Christ
691,xer0derm,Decent Movie,7,25 February 2004,"For many people this movie is apparently of some great importance.  To a pure movie enthusiast, this movie is just a documentary.  For the most part it follows rather closely to the Passion described in the Bible.  However, since no two versions printed in the bible are the same, it is hard to tell whats real and not (which only applies if you think the bible is a factual piece of literature).The gore of the movie was high, but it was well placed.  Like many action movies, if you dont like the sight of blood or bones, you shouldnt watch it.In terms of the religious aspect of the movie I fear that fewer people may go to see it based upon it's religious association.  That would be a poor choice.  I myself am an Atheist, but I enjoy history.  I looked at this movie as much more of a historical documentary/story.  In that regard it was excellent.If you have the stomach for it, and enjoy historical movies take the time to see this movie, it is well worth your time.  8/10",The Passion of the Christ

In short, it was a fantastic movie that anyone who has ever attended any kind of catechism or bible study will find true to the teachings of the gospel.  Yes: it is gory.  But, think about it: a crucifixion is gory.  For us to not understand that is to truly not understand the sacrifice being made here by this man named Jesus.With this said, is it not fair to allow any group (in this case, Christians) to make a movie about their beliefs: their gospel?  To say this movie is anti-semitic is to simply not understand Christianity and certainly to not have read the gospels that describe The Passion.  In my opinion, the critics of this story from the Bible perspective are the ones doing the hate mongering.  Criticize the film from an artistic standpoint and that would be a different story.  But to criticize the film from a biblical perspective is simply unfair.Go see the movie.  It might possibly change you.",The Passion of the Christ

But mark my words, if it wasn't for that, I would give it one star.In the hours before I saw it, I was pretty exited about watching it. While I was watching it when it aired that night on television, I didn't cry at all*, but there were a few moments where I just had to look away to avoid being absolutely shocked.I swear, I did not eat for at least fifteen hours after I watched the film. And it was still difficult to swallow food for at least twenty-four hours. Even now when I accidentally think about 'The Passion of the Christ' while eating, it puts me off.This film is definitely not for everyone.

694,atwarwiththebarmyarmy,"An anti-semitic slasher film is NOT a work of piety, no matter what the subject",1,12 August 2006,"I felt I had to comment, having read so many gushing reviews by people who longed to see this film and had all their self-righteous preconceptions realised.I had to say something. That Gibson was allowed to get away with so little opposition (and so much hard cash) is a terrible slur on western 'civilisation'. I felt embarrassed to be even close to a society which can accept this.To deal with the less offensive issues first: if Gibson wants to 'spread the good word', did it not cross his mind even once to suggest that people follow Jesus for a reason? If you'd lived all your life in a hole in the ground, and this was your first introduction to Christianity, you'd be confused. All this devotion just for a man who made tables, had dinner with his mates, and then got killed? Come on, Mel, you're missing the point. And then there's the violence. As devotees the world over wandered out of the theatre, they said that the violence was true, it was real, and it was important to let people know just how much Jesus suffered.Why? There are many very powerful films about the Holocaust, but none which spend an hour staring at people being murdered. It just isn't necessary, we can understand what's going on, and the horror of it does not require blood to be smeared across the screen. Quite the opposite, in fact; most films about suffering approach the subject with dignity. Gibson approaches this as one might approach a new instalment of Friday the 13th.And then there's the history; I know that many churches are not terribly strong on history. So perhaps many people have no idea that what happened to Jesus was everyday in early imperial Rome (particularly in the East, where rebellion was considerably more likely). There is absolutely NOTHING special in the story of a man being scourged and then crucified. The tradition goes that Jesus was scourged more fiercely than anyone else, and that only through being the Son of God did he survive - but there's nothing in the Gospels, however, to support this - he was scourged, end of story. And the crucifixion? Over nigh on two thousand years, Christian tradition has transformed the cross into a unique representation of Christ's suffering. But, historically, this is nonsense - crucifixion was a common form of execution, used to make an example to others. So what we have is the story of Jesus being treated like a common criminal, for two hours, in extreme and pointless detail. Worse still was the anti-semitism. Unbearably worse.It has been said, through these pages and elsewhere, that the movie cannot be seen as anti-semitic as it is the Romans who are doing the scourging and killing. It's been said, in one of the comments here, that 'we all know Pilate was an awful man'. Well, no, we don't - other than his professional background (moving up through the ranks, nothing unusual), all we know of him is the few details we get from the gospels. Yet the assumption that he must have been evil is used to excuse the representation of the Jews - that it's all a Roman conspiracy. What utter hogwash.The Roman Empire had many means for keeping control, and one was the employment of petty thugs to beat people - a very common tool for dictators right through to modern times. To say that showing these hooligans as they were is anti-Italian is, frankly, bizarre. You might as well decry the Godfather for being anti-Italian.Similarly, the oft-cited comparisons with Schindler's List is ludicrous. There is no notion that the Nazis represent everyone of German origin, far from it - the film, after all, is about a German who saved the lives of more than a thousand people who would otherwise have been murdered. A German who, like many of his countrymen, has a memorial at Yad Veshem.On the other hand, Gibson portrays the Jews in his film as heartless tyrants, as swarthy caricatures with no thought for others, as self-serving bigots. Now, these descriptions may fit Mel Gibson to a tee, but as a portrayal of respected elders within the Judaean community (learned, trusted people, not the handpicked thugs of the Empire) it's sickening. Gibson's far-right sect is a creed that blames Jews for everything; their message has no place in either our world or that of two millennia past. For him to flaunt his prejudice throughout the world's cinemas under the auspices of 'spreading the good word' is nothing short of criminal.Please, don't watch this film. Or any of Gibson's films (paricularly the 'historical' ones - apropos of nothing, I might point out that the Patriot and Braveheart are staggeringly unrealistic). He doesn't deserve to have made a fortune out of this sickening desecration.Don't believe that it's helping to spread the word of God - the word of God has nothing to do with prejudice, nor with hate, nor with obscene and unnecessary violence. Nor does it have anything to do with tables.If you feel you need a greater understanding of the life of Christ, read the Gospels. Go to church (not Mel's, please). Talk to people. And if you feel you need to know more about the Empire during his time, there's some very nice abridged editions of Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall...'.But, whatever your reason, please, not this.",The Passion of the Christ
695,Ghostface282@hotmail.com,"Excellent film, Overblown controversy",10,25 February 2004,"Without a trace of any anti semetic agenda, The Passion of Christ very powerfully shows the story of Jesus Christ's capture and crucifixion.  Mel Gibson does a superb job bringing the story to life and passing modern day Italy off as Israel.  Although quite brutal the film portrays rather vividly the punishment Christ received.  The cast as whole does an excellent job bringing their characters to life.  James Caviezel especially does a superb job humanizing Christ and he makes the audience feel each painful blow christ receives.As for the charges of anti semitism, it is non existent in this film and blown way out of proportion although mostly by people who have not seen the film.  In fact, there is a scene in which Simon, who helps Christ carry his cross, is mocked for being Jewish by a Roman soldier.  To further clarify, Simon just saved Christ from being beat, and the Roman soldier was a bad guy.In conclusion, I highly recommend this film.  Although it is quite violent, it is an emotionally charged look at Christ's death that will touch anyone's emotions.",The Passion of the Christ
696,Sutek_The_Mad,A powerful tribute to a powerful event.,9,26 February 2004,"I perused the message boards before writing this, and I have to say I am fairly disgusted with some of the things that are being talked about; most of the posts have nothing to do with the film at all, and engender hatred and malice amongst everyone, believers or not.  I hold degrees in Theology and Philosophy.  I could rant about religious doctrine and historical accuracy, but those things are not what this movie is about.  This film was made to evoke a side of all people that they may not necessarily have seen in themselves before.  It is clearly evident to me, after reading some of the posts, that this world is in a time of great despair and indecisiveness. When this film should be bringing us closer together as a people, it has very obviously turned us into nothing but hate mongers and people who walk their own paths only to trod upon the paths of others.  I feel saddened that I have to live in a world that homes people that have become so ensconced in the petty disputes of religion, sexuality, politics, and self service that they can harbor such thoughts about not only the film, but also about their fellow man.  We have all lost touch with what message this movie was made to send.our similarities make us stronger than our differences.

697,sonny30,Pointless piece of crap,2,5 November 2004,"This is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. It doesn't appeal emotionally and it is not informative either. I don't have a single clue why Mel Gibson made this movie. In the movie, I don't get to know Jesus and I don't see how he became such an important man with so many supporters. The lack of this background results in an absence of sympathy towards Jesus when he's being tortured and an absence of a strong feeling of hate towards his agressors. Moreover, the reasons why the people hate him are not clear at all. This movie is only showing us how Jesus was tortured and put to death. It is a bit violent now and then, but numerous other movies are more violent, so that is not the real problem here. The bloodspilling in this movie, however, is totally dysfunctional. When the movie was over, I said to my friend ""Huh? This is it?!"" It is a disgrace that Mel Gibson found investors for this movie, because any director would have done a better job. I rate this movie two out of ten points (instead of 1 out of 10), since the actor who played Pontius Pilate was okay. The fact that the movie was in ancient languages is original, but totally ineffective. Constantly watching the subtitles is even a bit distracting.2 out of 10",The Passion of the Christ
698,pourleschiens,what is truth?,6,15 October 2007,"This is a difficult film to review. On the one hand, it is a technical masterpiece and contains amazing work by everyone involved; on the other, it is as misguided as the Christian religion, and ultimately either devoid of meaning or nearly so. The message of the film, if only by accident, is that on earth, people suffer and die, and hurt each other. Anyway that's what I took from it.That is not what Mel meant for the film to be about, however. Christianity long ago decided (was in fact founded on the notion) that Jesus is best viewed not as a teacher but as a sacrifice, and that's how the story's always been framed. And that's why, I guess, viewers of this film witness less than a minute of Christ's preaching, and over an hour and a half of Christ's suffering and dying. About that- if he suffered and died for our sins, why will we suffer and die? Just for the heck of it, I guess.As for Christ's suffering and dying, as I said, it's all we see of him. We see none of his love or mercy, because it is impossible to be convincingly loving or merciful with your mouth a bloody mess. Whatever is claimed on its behalf, this is not an uplifting or inspirational film. It is the opposite, and one of the lasting impressions I have of it is that Jesus was blessed to die, as we all are blessed to die, considering the hate already loose in this world, and considering also man's capacity to suffer and to cause pain.Still, I found the film powerful, involving, and tremendously sad. Its sadness comes not from the Godliness of the sufferer, nor even from his Goodness, but from his humanity. He was a man, like anybody. The film is sad because the suffering is true, and the resurrection's not.",The Passion of the Christ
699,SteveB Ohio,"Mel, you are a genius. Please make a prequel and a sequel!",10,2 March 2004,"Anti-semitic?   Overly violent?  Not historically accurate?  What's the point of showing an innocent man being brutally put to death for two hours?    The answer to these questions can be found in the words of a very influential Jewish man by the name of Paul who lived at the time of Jesus: `For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.'   This same very Jewish man (indeed, once a Pharisee himself) continued by writing,  `but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.'     To read the negative reviews here, it is easy to see the truth of those words the Apostle Paul wrote so long ago  the message of the cross is indeed foolishness to those who haven't grasped it.  What is the point of showing all the blood, gore, and agony of one man being put to death in such a horrible way?   What kind of ego trip is Mel Gibson on, anyway?   How does all this blood demonstrate the love and peace of the teachings of Christianity?   Truly, to those who ask such questions, it is foolishness. However, it truly is the power of God.   This is a powerful movie.     This movie is very bloody.   Some may be offended by the realism and volume of it.   But to Christians, it is this same blood that has purchased our redemption.  Many of the most beloved Christian hymns sing praises to this blood.   A Christ who didn't suffer, bleed and die for us is not the Jesus of the Bible.   Gibson has done us all a great service in reminding us that this blood was very real.      Christianity is not just a warm fuzzy system of teachings designed to help us to be nice to each other, nor is it merely another choice on the ala carte menu of world religions.   Christianity is a relationship with the living God made possible only through that bloody sacrifice on that ugly cross.   Christianity is steeped in blood  the blood of Jesus, the Lamb of God who came to take upon Himself the sins of the world.   To Christians, this isn't poetry or mere religious symbolism.   It is real.   Christians who watch this film should thank God for every drop that splatters and flows.   Non-Christians should ask themselves and others why God would love them so much to go through this for them.     Crucifixion was an excruciating way to die.   Note that the very word `excruciating' comes from the word `crucify.'    Mel has pulled no punches in depicting the agony that Jesus went through.  Those shiny gold crosses that people wear around their necks as feel-good religious jewelry hide the ugly truth that the cross was one of the most repulsive forms of killing ever devised.   We might as well wear jewelry depicting a hangman's noose or a guillotine.     This movie is not entertaining.  It is shocking.   However, everyone should see it.   It is true to the Gospels, with a few non-Biblical events added that do not contradict the Gospels in any way.   Contrary to what some so-called scholars have said, these Gospels were  written by men who knew what happened.   Matthew and John were both eyewitnesses (and both Jews, for that matter.)  John was actually present at the foot of the cross.   Mark was a close associate of Peter.   Luke was written by a man of science (a physician) who thoroughly investigated the events and came to believe on the weight of the evidence.     Some have criticized this movie for showing Pilate as a wavering pawn of the Jewish leaders rather than the cruel executioner that history describes him to be.   However, Mel Gibson's portrayal here is true to the Bible and does not conflict in the slightest with history.  Matthew tells us that Pilate's wife had a dream about Jesus and warned Pilate not to condemn him.  This is why Pilate wavered and tried to do everything he could to release Jesus.  There was something different about this man compared to all the other Jews Pilate may have crucified in his career.  Yes, Pilate may have been cruel, but he had reason to waver when condemning this Jesus of Nazareth.     For those who still maintain that this is an anti-Jewish movie, please get a grip on reality.  Yes, the Jewish leadership of that time was instrumental in the death of Christ because He was a threat to their power and (they thought) could potentially turn Rome against them.   Yes, the Romans actually carried out the execution under the reluctant orders of Pontius Pilate.  But no,  the Jews were not responsible for the `death of God.'   The good news is that Jesus did indeed rise from the dead.  If not for the role of the Jews in Christ's death, Christians would have no hope at all.   In the end, His death and suffering were all part of God's plan, and Jesus voluntarily laid down His life for us.   The Jews were not `Christ killers,'  but they were merely fulfilling God's plan of redemption for all mankind.   No true Christian would incite violence against the Jews for what happened.  Jesus made a point to forgive them because they didn't know what it was they were doing.     Mel Gibson chose to focus almost entirely on the suffering and death of Christ in this movie, and he was supremely successful in showing us the horrible reality of those events.  It would have been helpful to include more of the reasons why it all happened, though.   My hope is that this movie establishes Mel as a force in Biblical films, and that he uses that clout to make additional films about the life of Christ and the actions of His disciples in spreading the message of forgiveness and redemption.",The Passion of the Christ
700,davylevine,Unbelievable that people take this film seriously. It's garbage.,1,10 April 2009,"I can't believe that people take this film seriously. The brutality is extreme and inexplicable. The soldiers who whip Jesus have little motivation for their cruelty. Everything about this movie is sappy and over the top. It is more like watching a dog-fight than watching a film about the savior of mankind. There is nothing human about the film, nothing that one can relate to. Some have commented that while they do not believe in God, this is a great story. But where's the story? What is the plot line? Where is the drama- except for the extreme cruelty there's little character development and no tension except the tension created by endless scenes of cruelty that cause you to ask, ""when will it stop?"" And when it does stop it is replaced by over-the-top scenes of maudlin sentimentality. Is it historically accurate? Of course not. To begin with, Jesus is not a white European. Jesus was a black man. If he existed, and if he was from Nazareth, then he was certainly not a white European. Nor was his mother a beautiful white woman. And as for his hair, Paul said, in the NT, that it's disgraceful for a man to wear long hair. People of that period had to have reasonably short hair. But, as with notions of God, people will construct their Jesus to fit what they think is an ideal. Certain scenes are so grotesque that they repel rather than fascinate: such as the scene with the woman holding a misshapen dwarf. What is the point of it all? This isn't Christian. It is not historical at all. It has nothing to with the kind of love I experience. It glorifies sadism. And it is a boring film. There isn't any drama- just a lot of blood interspersed with scenes of weeping. All of this causes one to wonder what kind of a religion worships so much blood and suffering? Do all Christians delight in agony? Is this the best of what Christianity offers the world? The film is a testament to a distorted, sick view of spirituality.

There is no plot and no firm character development (not even of Jesus). This film does have pretty great visuals however, and, as another user stated, accurately portrays the brutality of the time - but even still, two hours of plot less torture is difficult to watch, and not because of the blood.The film takes place in ""real time,"" or close to it, so that the two hours that go by on screen are closely represented by the two hours transpiring ""within"" the film. This makes for endlessly drawn-out scenes that become even more drawn-out when slow motion is applied. The film can be summed up in the following manner: Jesus gets beaten by soldiers, Jesus falls down in slow motion, Jesus gets back up. Repeat, repeat, repeat.If you're the type of person that ignores plot and character development, and strictly seeks out only the material that you have a preconceived favor for, then this film is still horrible - even for a simpleton like you. Keep in mind that this is one man's (Mel Gibson's) vision of The Crucifixion and that, despite all the eye-catching blood and gore and the emotions it brings up, it's still just that - one guy's vision.

704,Auburn668,"GIBSON'S ""PASSION"" WILL LIVE FOREVER",10,26 February 2004,"What Mel Gibson has achieved with ""The Passion of the Christ"" goes beyond any sort of personal belief system.  This will not stop its crusaders nor its detractors from doing everything they can to promote their agenda of his film.  How else can you explain the whopping number of 10's and 1's that the film has concurrently received so far in the Internet Movie Database's voting system?  The people have let their religious beliefs get in the way of judging the film.We've seen this before.  The roles were reversed when Martin Scorsese did his own ""The Last Temptation of Christ.""  The secularists loved it and many Christians thought it was blasphemy.  But Hollywood, and many who study it, are hardcore secularists eager to trample out any sort of movie that might, Heaven forbid, put Christ back at the forefront of American culture.  Their agenda is threatened by this because they don't want their belief system changed particularly if it makes their practices look questionable to the majority of people.  You don't believe me?  Let's just wait and see if the Criterion Collection attempts to get DVD rights for Gibson's film.  And please don't hold your breath while you wait.But history has a strange way of treating movies.  ""Citizen Kane,"" largely ignored in its own time because people simply could not grasp what Orson Welles had accomplished is now viewed as the greatest film ever made.  ""How Green Was My Valley,"" which all but swept the Academy Awards that year is now no more than a footnote in history.  Many people today have not even seen it and probably never will.It is not what people will say about ""The Passion of the Christ"" this year that will determine this film's place in history but how long they will say it.  The magnitude of Gibson's vision in creating not just the last hours of Christ but the volume of pain and suffering that he experienced in giving his life for all man's sin has earned this film a place in the top 10 films ever made.  Those are strong words.  But it is an even stronger film.It is difficult to even find a flaw in the film.  Gibson should get props, even with Hollywood's secularist agenda, for best picture and best director. Jim Caviezel will get a sure nod for best actor and Maia Morgenstern should be considered for supporting actress as well for playing the misery stricken mother of our Savior.  Caviezel in particular plays the son of God with such charisma, radiance, strength, and tenderness that his place as the greatest Jesus of all time to grace the silver screen is solidified. Screenplay, cinematography, and especially makeup and visual effects should all get Oscar mentions for 2004 as well.Many critics have said the violence of Christ's sufferings is too over the top to merit this film much more than a bloodbath on par with a decent horror flick.  These are the same critics who liked ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Kill Bill.""  As I said, they have an agenda and you can throw their comments out.  Carnage of this sort, to express a point and show man's inhumanity, has not been seen since ""Schindler's List"" (also in the all-time top 10) and no one rode Steven Spielberg's back for that monumental effort. The film IS extraordinarily violent but to be fair to Christ (which previous films could not do because of the time they were made in) it must be so to express exactly how great his sacrifice was.  Even with the violence, where Mel Gibson truly succeeds is in his minimalism.  The film is not bogged down in text, a possible pitfall considering it was made in Aramaic and Latin.  One can actually say that the film could have lived without text at all.  Gibson also shines in displaying the political turmoil that existed between the Pharisees and their followers, Christ and his followers, and the Romans themselves.  True historians will note that Pilate was on Caesar's hot seat even before Christ came along, explaining his rather sympathetic character when the uprising begins.  Gibson also added a Satan character to the action that pushes the film forward and I think it was a stroke of brilliance on his part to do so. The film's best scene, which I believe is arguably one of the most beautifully crafted scenes in motion picture history, is Christ's resurrection.  Ironically, it is comparable to the way Spielberg brought ""Schindler's List"" to a conclusion with Liam Neeson's fateful goodbye to the Jews he helped save (""I could've got more."")  There is simply not a dry eye in the house.  Mel Gibson knew exactly what he had in mind to bring us this vision and it is a feat of true directorial craftsmanship.But at the end of the day, ""The Passion of the Christ"" will give most viewers exactly what they bring into it.  If you are a Christian you will see your views expressed better than they ever have been before.  If you are a secularist your belief system is going to be threatened and you will probably not even be able to judge the film with any rationale because having Christ at the forefront of American society again (a feat this film could possibly pull off) would be the worst thing for your views and lifestyle.  If you are prejudiced against Jews, you too will find things to encourage your already ridiculous notions...even if you have to make them up yourself because the film certainly doesn't.  Mel Gibson is not out to change our world but to show us his world and he has succeeded beyond belief.  And if he and Christ pick up followers on the way, the film will not only have done its job but have acted as a messenger and this is what true cinematic masterpieces do in the first place.The nutshell:  Absolute required viewing and an immediate entry into the top 10 films ever made.  Considering that ""Braveheart"" also notches a place in the all-time top 20, if Gibson stayed behind the camera more his status as director could be on a par with Hitchcock, Griffith, and Scorsese...10/10.",The Passion of the Christ
705,shroom11_99,Brilliant,10,26 February 2004,"This film was beautiful. The sad part is that people who review this film would rather give their account of Christianity, and not an opinion of the film. The film was violent. Yes. But so is a crucifixion. Jesus was a Jew, killed by Jews and Romans. This is not anti-Semitic; it's an historical fact. It shouldn't stir up feelings of hatred for Jews, or Schindler's List for Germans or Japanese in Pearl Harbour. For those who don't believe in God, I honestly don't see the need for people to try and prove the gospels or not, or whether Paul was a Jew, which he was. If you aren't religious, watch it and view it like any other film, you don't have to prove it's historical accuracy, just as you wouldn't for Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. Freedom of speech is something we here Americans talk about a lot here in Australia. Use it, by all means, Mel Gibson did. But Anti-discrimination is a big word we hear as well, people have a right to believe what they wish without persecution, or we are going back thousands of years. On both sides of any fence. This film whether for historical accuracy, cinematography, or the right to practice free speech was absolutely brilliant.",The Passion of the Christ
706,madpenguin41,"Passion in ""Passion...""???",4,27 February 2004,"Two word review: insanely disappointing.I was very much looking forward to this film and was expecting and hoping to be deeply moved and involved, as one would expect from a film with the word 'passion' it its title.  Not only was I unmoved, but I had to fight to even stay focused on it.  I was glad I managed, because the film had some deeply rewarding moments, and I certainly wouldn't suffer through watching it again just to catch them.I'll start with said rewarding moments, just to appease the masses.  With few exceptions, every time the film did ACTUAL DRAMA (as opposed to the gimmickry which makes up its other 95%), it thrived.  Every exchange and flashback involving Mother Mary was simply marvelous, the final flashback sequence in particular (which is too good to spoil).  The denial by Peter was excellently done and the look between he and Jesus was easily the film's single most intense moment.  The Garden of Gethsemane scene is fairly strong up to the point when the Romans show up.Other good things about this film: I enjoyed the score (though it sometimes didn't seem to fit the film, it would sound great on its own!)  The acting was fairly solid (though once again, very few scenes required actual acting).  The camerawork was very good, and most of the effects looked good.Anyhow, the problem with the film is that there are five brilliant minutes scattered throughout that are all sheer beauty, maybe another ten that are decent but nothing special, and the rest of it is pointless, heartless, and numbing.Much has been made of the gore issue.  I personally have no problem with excessive violence and gore, if it's done right and adds to the overall effect of the film.  In this film, the gore is indeed well-done but the problem is that it IS the overall effect of the film... there's barely anything else.  Essentially, it's redundant and numbing.  The first few shots of flesh-tearing and blood-shedding are disturbing and make their point.  The viewer can't help but really feel them deeply.  However, a little goes a long way.  After a full minute of it, it becomes numbing and loses all effect.  After ten minutes, it's basically boring, redundant and pointless.  Speaking of redundancy, how many times does Christ have to fall over on the way to Golgotha?  That sequence easily ate up 20 minutes. After a solid hour of torture sequences there is no way that any more depiction of pain can possibly make any impact, but to run the same trudge-and-fall sequence over and over and over is just outright silly.Okay, even if somehow a viewer manages to be continually engrossed by the endless depiction of pain, here's the irrefutable flaw of the film: it means nothing in the context of the film.  In order for viewers to be moved by such a depiction, the character undergoing such suffering must be extremely well-developed.  Here, Christ barely has character at all, which is an insult to any of his followers.  The same goes for everyone except Pilate and Mother Mary.  Gibson assumes all the characters are already developed for him via the Bible.  This is stupid.  1.If his goal is to reach and move the masses, it might be nice to inform anyone unfamiliar with the story who these people are and what this whole mess of a movie is supposed to mean. 2.I don't care what a film is about, all action is totally pointless unless the characters are developed in it...Which brings me to my main point of why ""The Passion of The Christ"" ultimately fails.  On its own terms, this movie means nothing.  According to this film, Jesus is virtuous because he has an amazing pain tolerance and that's about it.  The only way this film could ever be remotely moving would be if you are a believer and constantly think to yourself every 30 seconds of watching ""he's suffering this so I don't have to.""  However, the film itself should be making that statement to you.  I mean, it shouldn't require EFFORT to be moved by it.  However, without this effort, the film is nothing more than a well done faux-snuff film.  In fact, aside from a few seconds of Jesus praying I would go so far as to say this film is practically devoid of any spiritual content whatsoever.  Sure if you link everything in it to your outside knowledge of the characters and events, it may work.  But a piece of art should not rely entirely on outside sources to make it have meaning.
Overall, this movie is very gimmicky.  The most obvious gimmick is shock effect, which fails because the brutality is only shocking for the first 30 seconds of its 90 minutes.  Second, is never-ending slow-motion which is used to the point that real time shots actually seem like some special ""fast-motion"" effect.  The third is pretentious ""artiness"" which is supposed to be some original symbolism: the devil carries a deformed infant that has the head of a creepy old bald man, some CGI scary goblin thing pops up next to Judas and shrieks, faces of children morph into demons, other pointless morbid images abound.  Basically, this points to the fact that Gibson would make an awesome horror movie: he loves endless brutality and gore and has a knack for creepy inexplicable images.  However, in this film, all these images are either distracting or laughable.I tried so hard to get into this movie I almost wore myself out in the process.  Some of the flashbacks to Jesus' life (WHAT? He had a life outside of endless torture???) started to be affecting, but always cut off after about twenty seconds and never meshed with the rest of the film well at all (with the exception of his domestic life with his mother).  After being numbed almost to death by the endless torture and crucifixion sequence, I figured I would at least be moved by the resurrection.  However, that ten-second scene felt more like a footnote and wouldn't have been missed if it were excluded altogether.  The few beautiful moments almost seemed in contrast, rather than supplementary to, the overall feel of the film, which was overwhelmingly morbid and soulless.I can think of few stories that have more passion and beauty in them than the story of Christ.  It should take no effort to create a film which captures at least some of that passion and beauty.  Yet somehow, Gibson practically misses all of it by a mile.  Excepting a few moving parts (we'll generously say they total five minutes scattered throughout), he has essentially made a film as effective as staring at a monolith for two hours. It's almost as if he painstakingly labored to systematically remove any passion, warmth or feeling from the story altogether.  Basically, if passion is judged by volume of blood content, ""The Passion..."" delivers in spades. Otherwise, it's a film with the most self-contradicting title ever.This film is an insult to Christians in its depiction of Christ as little more than a punching bag.  It is an insult to fans of film in its insistence that film need not contain elements such as character, theme, and feeling. However, I don't see how it's insulting to Jews in any way.  If ""Schindler's List"" was insulting to Germans, ""Braveheart"" insulting to English people, ""Pearl Harbor"" insulting to Japanese, and ""Titanic"" insulting to all boats, one may have a case.  Anyhow, unless you are a huge fan watching a person be relentlessly tortured, avoid this film at all cost.All in all, this movie simply leaves me scared that I share this earth with someone who claims to pour all his heart and soul into a work of art and comes up with this.",The Passion of the Christ
707,sebastian_goofy,Just a poor movie- regardless of the story,1,25 November 2004,"Finally I've seen that movie.. And I wonder why I wasted my time. It is an awful piece out of the arts of films. You get poor directing, mediocre (at its best) acting, and the photographer would fit into any commercial producing company- for cat food or something similar. Was there a main actor? I didn't see anyone acting, just a bunch of red flesh and blood. There might have been good actors, but every time a scene came up that could have used some acting it was all beaten down with slow-mo. Like catfood falling into the dish, whoa, the message of the film has been delivered. Don't miss it tumbling out of the can into the nap. The idea to use the original (as far as we know) languages is worth 1 point. I would have given another point for the story, but there is no one who could take the credit for.OK, now I said a lot of bad things about that movie. I have to admit, it's a tough story- hard to film. Most people know it, and most people have already had THEIR version of it in their head. But I don't complain about the interpretation- I complain about it being a poorly made movie.",The Passion of the Christ
708,gnosis1,"The Passion is boring, brutal and disheartening",5,29 February 2004,"The Passion of the Christ is a very controversial movie, speaking strictly as a moviegoer I give the following review.In summary, the movie was slow, boring and brutal.  The violence is intense enough to horrify any sane individual, and the cinematography is on par with something produced for television.  Although I applaud Gibson for only having the dialog in Aramaic and Latin, I am sorry to say it is also stale. Too many shots in slower motion, crying faces and trite orchestral music(the kind you hear in the sad slow parts in many many movies) make the movie corny.  The violence is extended and visceral and more disheartening than in any movie I have ever seen.  If you are a Christian this movie may speak to you, if you are not however and you dont enjoy extreme torture and an overall boring movie, pass on this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
709,roger-a,violence... the basis of Christianity?,1,9 March 2004,"Being brought up as a Christian but without the religious icons about the physical suffering of Jesus, I found it difficult to sit through The Passion of the Christ. Although Mel Gibson completely manipulates the audience by the relentless torture of Jesus I found myself completely removed from any emotional impact many viewers felt when viewing this film.Many human beings have ben tortured and killed for a cause. That doesn't make them The Messiah. This overly simplistic message is dangerous. Jesus' words and actions take a back seat to the emphasis of his physical being. Which was completely the opposite of his words and deeds... that there is more to our lives than the physical.The message he emphasized over and over was one of love, turning the othercheek, the power of forgiveness, of the rejection of violence... the things that the organized Christian movement seemed so lacking in, since its inception 1700 years ago. But here is a movie that emphasizes violence above all. Not surprising looking at Gibson's list of pictures using violence as a means to an end.How is it that many 'Christians' who thinks there is too much violence in films can accept that violence when its portrayed against their Lord? Bizarre indeed! But an overly simplistic faith will lead to strange behaviour. The violence used in films like the Lethal Weapons series can be dismissed easily. But this is important subject matter and deserves more thought.As a film lover and film maker I was also unmoved when watching this movie. I completely respect Gibson for financially backing the project but as a story, it lacks that which is necessary to be complete. The slo-mo. stuff was so uninspired. The fact that Jesus never blacked out during the ordeal made him not human - but super human.Other films, even epics like Ben Hur, deal with the story of The Christ much better. Better written, acted(excluding prince Heston),  photographed and far more compelling. The Passion was an experimental film that tweaks those who lack strong conviction or the desire to search for the truth themselves.
What is the message of this motion picture? Jesus was a man and suffered physically in the end? What a waste of time and money.BUT... as Roger Ebert said recently, ""People who normally talk about sports or the weather seem to be talking about this... something more important."" And as Martha Stewart said before being dragged off to prison, ""And that's a good thing.""The Buddha or Jesus or in modern times Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr., is there not enough material from these individuals for us to be moved, compelled, challenged or driven toward their message without these overly simplistic stories?'What Would Jesus Do?' if he saw this film? Probably shake his head yet again and exclaim, ""After 2000 years, they just don't get it!""",The Passion of the Christ
710,kanda81,NOT The Greatest Story Ever Told...,4,28 April 2004,"Greetings...Unfortunately, I live in a vault, and went into the movie thinking that Mel Gibson was playing the part...  OOps.... When I recovered from that mistake, I sat there shaking my head thinking, this is trash, this will never play over the Easter holiday on TBN, This has NOTHING to do with Jesus...Then I got it...What this is, is the Brutal Truth.  Not the sanitized pablum you get fed in sunday school.  You should already KNOW the dialog, because it's a movie for those of us who already do.  We already know the story.  This is all the bits that your 20th century liberal upbringing and 2000 years of sanitation efforts has kept you from seeing.It's the message that inspired Christianity.  The Wake-Up call that the desciples themselves sold to the populace of THAT time.  Your average person back then was intimately familiar with this kind of brutality and could easily identify with the hero.This movie isn't a replacement for ""The Greatest Story Ever Told""...It's a suppliment...

From the beginning, the movie grasped my attention, and did a marvelous job of putting me in the scene, in the act, in the time, and at the place. An emotional roller coaster for any Christian, or anyone who even vaguely knows the story of the Passion. The acting was stupendous, each actor clearly knew their part, and what was needed, and flawlessly delivered exactly what was asked of them. John Debney's score for the film added to the layers of emotion, and added to the story by echoing it in the background. Finally, I'll just say that you could almost feel the pain of the characters, and if not, then you felt emotions in response to the situation. Anger, sadness, indifference, etc. If you know the story of the Passion, watch this movie. It will quite literally leave you speechless at the end.",The Passion of the Christ

As I have studied the bible for about 25 years I know the subject fairly well and this film gets it just about spot on. The only glaring mistake is one I expected anyway which is that Jesus did not die on a cross but on a simple wooden stake (the Greek word used in the bible is stauros which meas simply tree, it was the pagans that introduced the cross as a symbol). Even though I know what happened to Jesus those 12 hours watching it on screen as it really happened had a massive impact. It's very easy to say Jesus did this, Jesus did that, but not really understand what he really would have gone through on behalf of you and me. It's well produced, has a wonderful musical score and Mel Gibson has been very brave in trying be honest to the bible account at the risk up upsetting a few people.

They'll come out damaged. {I was way more impressed with and inspired by Jeffrey Hunter's portrayal back in 1961 - it lent dignity to the entire story.} Gibson's portrayal was over the top and medically inaccurate - Jesus would have been dead of shock and blood loss from the scourging alone.

Amazing that the Lethal Weapon and womanizing What Women Want and Mad Max/Thunderdome Heartthrob and cursing sex symbol can create(or recreate) such an epic. True or false, accurate or not and whether you are a believer, it is a powerful and gripping and more than anything...disturbing depiction of Jesus's last 12 hours. I had a very difficult time sitting through it and watching the extremely graphic torture scenes. I found myself in tears and kept wondering when it was going to be over. Ironically, at the time I was watching it, I was on vacation in Arizona and I had developed a toothache prior to entering the theater. I can assure you that my toothache as painful as it was, paled in comparison to what Jesus was going through or went through. I know that everything is relative, but he REALLY took one for the team so to speak.I have read other reviews on this film.I really did not see the Antisemitism that everyone was ranting about. Sure Pontius is known as a tyrant and a monster, but the Film was the focus of Christs last 12 hours before his crucifixion, not about Pontius. I am not oversimplifying his portrayal, but the bottom line is that the Jews did not kill Jesus either way. The film is graphic, gory and even scary, to put it mildly, but it definitely drives home the point!! Whatever you perceive the point to be.It is a film that everyone should see at least once. It is not for the faint of heart or the squeamish, but since it is (based on) historical facts and is Biblical, it is something that should be seen.It is hard to sometimes read the subtitles and watch the movie, but I know Mel Gibson wanted to create the illusion of the way the people spoke at the time, so it was tolerable.Overall, it was a very well-done and well documented movie.",The Passion of the Christ

Like other reviewers, I'm having a hard time putting my arms around it.  Some initial thoughts:1.  Although mostly biblical, there are some licenses taken, one of which I find very disturbing:  Jesus is never recorded as saying to Pilate anything like ""I do not blame you, but the one who sent me to you.""  It's not a throwaway line, and 'way too much mischief can be made out of it.  It should not have been included.2.  The conflation of the 4 Gospel stories is somewhat problematic for me, since each wrote with a specific theological point of view, and none intended to be primarily or onlybiographical.  All agree on Jesus and that he was tried and executed, but the point of view is in the details of each Evangelist's text, and that is muddied a lot in this treatment.3.  The Resurrection is almost just glossed over, when in fact it, together *with* the Crucifixion, is the central Christian story about Jesus. Crucifixion without Resurrection is merely a politically expedient death; Resurrection without Crucifixion doesn't make any sense.  *Both* are needed and are essential to understand Christ.4.  I was dismayed that the proclamation in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, by the centurion that Jesus was indeed God's Son, was missing from this movie. For a film purportedly made to proclaim Christ as Lord, to miss the fact that a foreigner actually is the one who gets it (in Mark, everyone else has fled) is a key theological point that would have added much.

Pontius Pilate is an incredible character, brought to life even moreso than by Barry Dennon's version in Jesus Christ Superstar.All things aside, the real issue is what to do when the movie is over... do you go on, pretending that it never happened, or do you contemplate the question, ""What if it's true?""",The Passion of the Christ

There is nothing remotely spiritual about what is shown, only brief flashbacks to the last supper and the Sermon on the Mount are shown to give any religious feeling. While Jesus is portrayed in his usual pacifistic role other characters are not so lucky. Pilate is reduced to a spineless coward to afraid to make a decision that he turns to his fictional Christian sympathizing wife Claudia for advice. Nowhere in any religious text or historical documents have I ever heard of such a women. It seems she was added to make Pilate less of a villain, which is a false assumption. Satan is portrayed not as a beautiful seductive woman or a charming man but as a bald pale faced figure which makes even less sense. Perhaps the biggest controversy is whether or not this film is Anti-Semitic. I cannot say for certain if it is or not, people will see what they want to see either way. However I can understand how such accusations can be made. The majority of Jesus' suffering comes at the hands of the Jews, who spit on, beat, and taunt him throughout the movie. The Romans on the other hand merely sit back and watch only a hand full of Roman guards taunt or beat Jesus leaving much of the work to the Jewish crowd. It seems as though Gibson dealt out the responsibility quite lopsided in his production and I can see how many could construe that as Anti-Semitism. Whether or not it was intentional is anyone's guess.In the end though The Passion is a over the top pretentious and self serving religious flick. Hardly worthy of praise of such classic spiritual movies like The Last Temptation of Christ, King of Kings, or The Greatest Story Ever Told. These movies are critically acclaimed because they not only have great acting and production values but because they focused on the importance of Jesus' teachings and the way he lived his life. To focus on nothing more than on how he was executed is not the way one should base their religious faith. Love the man and his teachings don't focus on the way he was butchered.",The Passion of the Christ

726,Desertdback,"The controversy, the arguments, the anti-semitism, who killed Christ?, everything about this movie was all blahh to me after I saw the first few minutes of this film.",10,29 February 2004,"The controversy, the arguments, the anti-semitism, who killed Christ?, everything about this movie was all blahh to me after I saw the first minute of this film. It all just fazed away into nothingness. As the movie opens in the garden of Gethsemane, as Jesus is praying to his Father about what he was about to endure. I can't say enough or anything about this film really. You can just feel the passion of Jesus Christ and his love for us all throughout this film. As Christians, we believe that Jesus wasn't killed by the Jews or by the Romans or by anyone, but he in turn let himself die for us. That is what this film centers around is everything that Jesus went through, all the brutal, emotional terror that he had to endure for us, he did it, so that we may live for eternity. This movie, brought me to tears, so many times that I can't even count for you, just to see my saviour, my God, lay down his life for us, but just not lay it down, but to be whipped, chained, beaten, mutilated, words cannot even begin to bring a picture to what he had to go through. This film is raw, it is intense, it is brutal, but I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. I guarentee that it will leave you with more passion and emotion, then any other movie ever will. The acting in this movie was superb. The entire movie was spoken in Greek/Arabaic. I was impressed at how well this came off... Even having to read subtitles, you can feel the raw intensity and emotion from the actors/actresses, throughout the film. I had the feeling that I was watching this all take place before my eyes. This film is one that will probably one of the most critique films of the year, if not of the decade. Because of what this story means to a lot of people throughout the world. People that hadn't even seen this film, I heard speaking out against it, which is just ridiculous in my mind. Go see it then tell me what you feel about it.
The cinematography, Set Design, and Costumes made this film look even more amazing. Mel Gibson, who directed, produced, and majorly funded this film did a great job. His vision for the film and everything, truly looked and felt amazing.This movie had heart, passion, love and so many other things. I have heard this story, probably told more then any other, throughout my entire life, but seeing it actually played out before me was somewhat brutal and raw, but on the other hand it just shows the passion and love that Jesus had for us to be able to endure every step. I just wanted to cry out and yell as I saw Jesus beaten and skin ripped off of his body, see the blood squirt up as he is nailed to the cross. To know what he went through and to see this in front of visually for the first time in a raw sort of way, was something that I just can't describe to you, you will just have to go see it for yourself.

727,mravsky-2,"Love, huge love and forgiveness",10,25 February 2004,"The strongest feeling that emanates from this film is that of tremendous love Jesus had for us, weak and sinful people, what we all are today as those then who crucified him were. We all did crucify him as we all do each day when we don't reach out to each other. Each day when we do not ask questions and do not feel other people's misery. The miseries of the modern time, more than ever, emanate from our ignorance and inability to feel other's pain. We are selfish and greedy, and a film like this, in all of its heaviness, reminds us how we should not be. (When it comes to greed and selfishness, hmmm, what comes to mind nowdays? Be honest!).We should not be like the high priests (who felt threatened by Jesus and forced Pilate to murder him brutally) in *any* way which we found objectionable. We should not be like Pilate who let such an injustice happen because of his own fear of scorn from Rome if there be unrests. We should not be as ignorant as the crowd (as if anyone cared what the crowd thought! Whenever did one care?!)A lot in this movie was shown that we should not be like. That is a very tough imperative to fulfill. Nowdays, unfortunately, not much is different than in those old times. Many things are worse. And that's why Jesus's message is more needed then ever.I am sure that this film will incite goodness in people. Or whatever little of it still exists.A must-see-must-think-about film!",The Passion of the Christ

729,grandma fran,excellent,10,27 February 2004,"Superbly done! I did not see any portrayals of and anti-jewish nature. There were only Jews and Romans in the film. The family, friends and towns people were Jewish. Jesus received much sympathy and some help from Jewish people. The High Priests were portrayed as political, having no thoughts other than their political motives. That occurs to all peoples, not just Jewish. With Jesus being Jewish, the obvious heritage of Christians is Jewish. The movie needed to be graphically violent to portray the realistic, horrific nature of His crucifiction. From studying that I have done, the actual crucifiction was much worse than even this movie portrayed. I also think it is within the rights of Mel Gibson to portray this event as he sees it in his mind's eye. The same as with The Last Temptation being portrayed as Scorses saw it. Gibson has repeatedly denied being anti-semetic. I hold him to his word. He does not have a history of being a liar. All movie makers, that are successful, make a profit from their work. That's their job. ""Making money from the suffering of Jesus"" is no different than making money from the suffering of the victims of the holocaust or the casualties of war. I appreciated the artistry that went into this film. The actors, especially protraying Jesus and Mary, were fantastic, deserving of awards. Technical, make-up, cinematography, direction are also worthy of awards. I am afraid that prejudices will prevent that. But let's see, maybe Hollywood can practice what they are preaching and put their anti-Christian feelings aside.",The Passion of the Christ
730,eekeeley,Jeebus,2,24 January 2008,"As a fairly religious person (but not too uptight about it), I thought I could watch this movie and enjoy it/be inspired as a reaffirmation. Wow. If that film is meant to be used as a prostletizing tool, it's going to drive people away from the religion rather than towards.It's so self-indulgent, starting with the use of Aramaic. How very pre-Vatican II of Mel to tell us that we can't actually hear the movie in our own language, it must be interpreted for us through his subtitles. It does, however, spare the actors of much burden to deliver the lines realistically as we have to read the subtitles rather than really listen to the dialogue anyway. The presence of whatever the devil was supposed to be was also ridiculous, unbiblical (the devil is mentioned once in Jesus-related bible stories), and almost laughable in the over the top nature of it.Then there's the violence. I get that Jesus suffered at the hands of the Romans. I also understand that Jews suffered horribly at the hands of the Nazis, but I don't think anyone would want to accept a two hour, blow by blow film on a death in the concentration camps complete with a real-time gas chamber death. Schindler's List was pushing it, but managed a distance and a tastefulness utterly lost in this film. Movies that portray human suffering well do it in doses, not excruciating, horrifying, over the top detail. And as for the details being accurate: I suppose that's up for interpretation. I know crucifixion deaths are horrible ways to die, and that Jesus was scourged but at the same time I don't recall the bible telling us that he was beaten for hour upon hour while the torturer chose from a selection of tools, each more gruesome than the next. Mary and company mopping blood off the floor was also a bit much. While the very basic structure of the film may be biblical, it's filled with a lot of Mel Gibson's interpretations which were tedious rather than inspiring.Had the film wanted to give a more in-depth look at Christ's sufferings, it would have made much more sense to focus on his life, and what he and his followers lost that day, than on the brutality of his death. Mary is a presence in the film, but even in the tiny flashbacks you aren't given any real sense of her life with Jesus and what losing her son would mean to her. Same thing with the disciples. Jesus, in turn, had to be sacrificing normalcy, companionship, joy for this as well. But all we see is some guy, who we know is divine and human but we never see the humanity (except a little in the garden), get snuffed out over 2.5 hours.In any other movie, the over the top acting, the costumes, the bloodshed, would have been ridiculed. But because this movie was about Jesus it was destined to be promoted by the people who promoted it and free of any criticism.The movie also had this agonizingly slow, beating pace that just gave me a headache. The movie didn't speak to me (partly because it didn't want to). It did turn into one long snuff film that made me want to take a shower more than anything else.The Nativity Story is a decent interpretation of a biblical story as if focuses on humanity. I would see that and steer clear of the Beatdown of the Christ.",The Passion of the Christ
731,gazebo350,Re: religious themes in films,5,4 February 2007,"First of all i have not seen this film. i have seen coming attractions and have heard a lot of pro and contra in its regard. i did see the movie as an illustrated book form however. nonetheless here is my take on all movies on biblical or religious subjects. i have been brought up as a Christian. however at this point in my life i see religion as concerning itself with the mythical and not the factual. religion portrays the world as we would like it to be. ie a place of meaning where all the injustices will one day be ironed out. since this to me is preposterous i must take all religions as a falsification of life. let us return to the passion of Christ. how is it possible that the one who claims universal love and forgiveness has as its centerpiece the accusation of deicide for the Jews. indeed it says in Matthew, when Pilate (protrayed in a sympathetic light due to the fact that the gospels were being written and addressed to the pagans chiefly) Pilate said ""i find no fault with this man and addressing the Jews he said what would you that i do to this man"" and the Jews responded, ""crucify him, crucify him may his blood be upon us and upon our children"". do you know how much suffering this has caused countless generations of Jews especially leading up to the holocaust? i would like all Christians who see movies like the passion of Christ to meditate on this awful indictment.

732,tgrosso,A True Love Story,10,25 February 2004,"WARNING ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Well I heard a lot of rumblings about this movie before being able to view it.  There was a lot in the press surrounding anti-semitism and so forth and it seemed to me the press was trying to spew hate with this film.  I am an elder in a church and was invited to a private screening before opening night.  Last night I had the pleasure of viewing and I have to say that I can't imagine anyone feeling hate after viewing this film.  The film does as best it can at portraying the original language and Gibson succeeds at coming very close to what the scriptures say.  The film begins with Jesus in the garden praying with his closest disciples asleep.  You can actually see Christ sweat blood.  The presence of Satan adds to this film as you can see that Christ was indeed tempted with the fact that at any time He could have stopped the brutality that was being inflicted upon Him but obedience prevailed.  I think it is important to note that the scriptures stated that Christ was barely recognizable when His flogging and crucifixion occurred and the film did not fail in portraying this.  This is a true love story of what Christ did in obedience to His Father in Heaven to take the sins of the world upon Him.  Anyone who wants to call this film anti-semitic needs to remember that Mel Gibson did show up in the film.  He is in one scene only and that is the scene which drives the spike through Christ's hand. Gibson, himself, feels responsible for Christ's death as we all should feel.",The Passion of the Christ

The Jews told us that Schindler's List was an important film so that no one forgets about the plights of the Jews, and yet now they say that we should forget about what Jesus had to go through. It is history, it happened, get over it. Atrocities have been committed by every race at some point in history.

It's not a perfect movie, I don't think any movie really is, but it's an important movie about a man who died for us, for our children, for our very souls! People who don't like this movie just don't understand about God or about spirituality, they don't appreciate the pain and suffering Jesus Christ endured. When this movie came out people panned it because of the violence and gore, but no one panned Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, both of which were far more violent. Jesus Christ died a horrible horrible death, and it's not wrong for Mel Gibson to depict that death as it happened, the way it happened. Would atheists prefer if the Romans had whipped Jesus only twice or three times, then somehow placed him non-violently on the cross? No, it was horrible and brutal, and it was done to our Lord, and it hurts me to know that so many people do not like or simply do not understand this movie.",The Passion of the Christ

Caviesel probably should have been nominated for best actor, but it doesn't matter because everybody knows that is going to Jamie Foxx for Ray anyway so there was really no point in nominating anyone else. Any way back to this move. It just doesn't work as an award contender anyway. This really doesn't work in the sense of story telling which from the beginnings of storytelling in the Greek world, let's not get into a debate over that, but the earliest stories and plays still in existence today are from the ancient Greeks. The story to be good has to have a character that is tragically flawed, for serious performances. This was even true in the stories told with Christian elements before now, let's not forget the saga of Everyman, but this film with the exception of being the most graphic depiction of the crucifixion and therefore maybe the most accurate still did nothing for the Christian religion by examining the nature of Christ, why he did accept the crucifixion or more importantly why that his death was important. I think for the Christian majority that love this film they should really turn their attention to ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" directed by a man that is nominated again this year and ""In Sha' Allah"" will win, finally.

I'm not of the opinion that the movie was anti-semitic. The story isas it has been written in the Bible. I saw plenty of good Jewsthroughout the movie too--the most important being Jesushimself--and I definitely don't hate him! (or a fellow human beingFOR THAT MATTER!).

Despite all the controversies that surrounded it upon its release, I was more than willing to give it a chance in the interest of hearing a fresh insight. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't offer that. It doesn't even come close. What it does offer is violence of a nature I have NEVER seen before in a movie. I'm not typically squeamish, but this was beyond uncomfortable. No doubt that was the intention, but I found it to be so grotesque that it made me ignore the story. (That COULDN'T have been ol' Mel's intention.) The man from Australia (by way of Peekskill) is an interesting individual: intelligent, articulate, and creative. But he's got some very serious demons that lurk within, and those demons have a starring role in many of his movies. He's the kid in ""Toy Story"" who created the hideous monsters out of the other toys. It's clear that something's eating at Mel. Too bad. Hey, Mel, buddy, listen up: I agree that the human race is capable of horrible, horrible things. And the killing of a beautiful spirit like Christ is one such example.

742,davedeefam,The Shock and Awe of Jesus Movies,10,4 April 2004,"Yes, that is how my wife described it.  Gibson grabs the audience from the beginning and bludgeons them with unrelenting scenes of violence, cruelty, and emotional trauma.  In the end, even I shed a tear, and there are scant few times in my life that can be said.  Still, was it good?  Was it accurate?  Was it uplifting?  Was it anti-Semitic?  Was it needlessly violent and cruel?  Well, here it goes:****POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*****First, for the big question: Was it anti-Semitic?  No.  Not unless you are of the school (and there is one) that says that the Gospel accounts are a priori anti-Semitic.  Then, yes, it is.  But that claim is open to much dispute, and may say just as much about those making it as it does about those things they are claiming to describe.  In fact, I was taken by scenes that go out of there way to show various Jewish characters in sympathetic, if not heroic, roles.  No, the Romans come off much worse.  For where the Jews who set up Jesus are shown to be corrupt and desiring to eliminate this one man; the Romans are brutal barbarians who seem to take great delight in beating anyone who comes in their way.  Yes some Romans are made to look good, but so are some of the Jewish characters (note those in the trial protesting that this is an unfair trial).  The line Gibson draws is the one he usually does: you are either the good guy, or the bad.  If you are bad, you are really bad (see his portrayal of the English in `Braveheart' - which, indecently, did not see many of the same critics leaping out and saying that the Anglo male has been unfairly portrayed.  Who knows, maybe there are biases all around?). I just hope that the next time some other group is also shown in such broad brush strokes the criticisms are just as loud.The violence.  Was it too much?  Perhaps, but probably not for the audiences today.  To be honest, I was rather taken by the violence.  I expected it to be worse.  After all, many of the movie critics who bashed it for being too violent have praised such filmmakers as Scorsese and Tarantino for their masterful filmmaking.  So the violence had to be worse than theirs. Actually, it isn't (see the torture scene in `Reservoir Dogs', a movie hailed by critics.  The scenes in `The Passion', while longer, are no more horrid).  Yet, strangely, many of these critics who praise such artistic use of violence suddenly come down with a strange case of the heebbie jeebbies with this movie.  Yes, the violence lasts longer, but frame for frame, it is no worse than I have seen in many a modern R-Rated movie.
Is it true that the Gospels only mention flogging and crucifixion in simples sentences, not elaborate detail?  Yes, but that is how they describe most things, succinctly.  They were in many ways oral tales written down, and the singular words would no doubt have evoked a vivid picture.  Yes, you could probably go up to a first century person in the Roman Empire and say the word 'crucifixion', and no doubt they would have very vivid images, because many probably saw it happen. We have historians and archeologists who can fill in the details of what they saw.  We are the same.  Say the words 'Auschwitz', or '9/11', and we can have some pretty vivid images pop into our minds.  Gibson just shows us what historians have told us for years.
I don't know, I am beginning to think that perhaps some people just didn't like the idea of a traditional approach to the Jesus story, didn't want to like it, and had to find something to say.  So, anti-Semitism and violence were the best they could do (people do that sometimes.  They oppose something because it hits some core nerve, or isn't along their line of thinking, then have to figure out why they didn't like it after saying so).
Was it accurate?  Well, as books to movies go, I usually don't sweat accuracy too much.  After all, the filmmakers have to make some changes. Let's face it, books today are written by authors with the one hope that they become movies.  In some modern novels, I can almost see the notes in the margins saying where the cameras should be.  And yet, when they come to the screen, how many changes must be made!  How much more then will an account of something written a thousand worlds away, without the thought that there may be a movie of it someday, have to step apart from the text. It took some liberties, sure.  But not more than most directors do, and not nearly as many as some.Was Pilate portrayed wrong?  No, not really.  It is only recently that the full blame of the death of Jesus has been placed on Rome and Pilate.  As late as the 1980s, most secular historians considered Pilate to be cruel, but only insofar as he lived in a cruel world in a cruel society.  He was just one of many.  His removal was a result of his failures to keep peace, not because he was cruel.  No, even in a main history text used in undergraduate courses in the late 80s states Pilate was no monster, simply a ruthless man at the wrong place at the wrong time (I don't know the etiquette of using quotes on this board, but would be happy to supply the sources).  I would imagine that Gibson took this view of the man.Was it spiritually uplifting? Perhaps, that is an individual decision. It was certainly Catholic, and I am not Catholic, though I was not offended. Of course it is from a Catholic point of view.  Whether or not this will lead to conversions en masse remains to be seen.  The film itself is remarkable for what it did on a limited budget, and how, once again, Gibson has delved into long-dead genres and raised yet another one to the forefront of the movie industry's thinking (films about Jesus from traditional, non-antagonistic perspectives have been a rare thing the last couple decades).  Perhaps it is a sad commentary on our modern intolerance toward things religious that a film, by any other standard to be praised by critics, is instead cut to ribbons (and this, beginning over a year before it was even finished).  But like many works of art, sometimes it says more about the people who see and react to it than the ones who create it in the first place.",The Passion of the Christ
743,kellychitwood,Masterpiece,10,26 February 2004,"""The Passion of The Christ,"" produced and directed by Mel Gibson, provides an unequaled opportunity to experience firsthand the final 12 hours of Christ's life, including the crucifixion, arguably the most pivotal events in human history.Cinematically, `The Passion' is a masterpiece.  The remarkable acting is especially impressive because the actors convey so much without dialogue. The subtitles and foreign languages do not interfere with the film's message.  The use of flashbacks on the part of Jesus and Mary provide both context and poignancy for the events currently unfolding. The makeup necessary to create a beaten and wounded Christ is so realistic as to be almost too perfect.  Certainly, these bloody images have already drawn criticism for being extremely graphic. Breathtakingly creative camera work and a few carefully chosen special effects make the supernatural aspects of the film at once believable and unnerving.Professional film critics and early movie-goers warn of this film's violence, and rightly so. The brutal nature of `The Passion' makes it unsuitable for children.  But the very brutality of ""The Passion"" speaks eloquently against violence.  For Christians to fail to see this film on the basis of its violence is, frankly, an act of cowardice.  Anyone professing to believe that Christ sacrificed himself for humanity's redemption needs to understand exactly what that sacrifice meant.  With excruciating intensity, ""The Passion"" forces Christian viewers to comprehend the terrible cost of salvation.The brouhaha about ""The Passion"" fueling anti-Semitism deserves but one comment: Only someone actively seeking persecution will find it by viewing this film.  For the vast majority of movie-goers, ""The Passion of The Christ"" will spark not hatred, but humility and will likely result in some unprecedented soul-searching.Mel Gibson tells the story of ""The Passion"" as one inspired, even compelled, to do so. Clearly, he means to arouse a world of complacent Christians to a sense of what their redemption cost.  For non-Christians, Gibson aspires to promote inquiry into the life of Jesus, founder of one of the world's great religions. It seems unlikely that Gibson will care whether this film wins dozens of awards or none. Neither does its money-making potential seem important, except as an indicator of the number of people it reaches, for Gibson himself has said that he felt making `The Passion' was something of a divine commission.  If such is true, then surely his Creator must be saying, `Well done, thou good and faithful servant.'",The Passion of the Christ
744,thedevilyouknow00,Religious Porn,1,22 March 2004,"Or Star Wars for the Born-Agains.And I'm talking the prequels- not old School Star Wars. I don't get it. While I have the basic story down, I admit a deficit in the details of ""Scripture.""  What was Gethesmane? Who are the Pharasiees? etc. And this is probably why 'Passion' sucks as a movie: It relies on viewers bringing their own knowledge and applying it to the events. There is considerable backstory that we never see and the film is thus hurt by it. There has been much made of anti-Semetism. I'm not Jewish and was not offended. And I'm not sure where the notion that the Jews killed Christ or that their descendants should continue paying for it came from. I found the Jews and Romans to be equally reprehensible and uninteresting. And then I have to address the myth that this film is successful because it is dealing with religious subject matter which has been neglected by Hollywood blah blah blah. Bull. Hollywood has and still deals with religious subject matter. Only they don't jackhammer your brain with it like 'Passion' does. What is the Matrix trilogy but an examination of the notion of Saviours and Salvation? What about 'Dogma'?  And those are the most glaring examples. But because the target audience for the Passion (white people that didn't learn anything in school and believe in invisible men) can't think beyond the surface of a concept, they don't go to those films or bother to try and understand. They want things simple and without elaboration. Something they don't have to think too hard about. Well they've got it. 'Passion' is the ultimate no-brainer, in fact, it's best if you don't ask questions at all.",The Passion of the Christ
745,derektetlow-459-856509,"Interesting, Yet Brutal Period Piece",5,6 April 2014,"After many years of avoiding this film for the reason of knowing that Christ died for the sins of man, but not wanting to see him suffer up close, I decided to finally watch The Passion on Netflix.While I understand where the people who both loved it (10) and hated it (1) are coming from, I decided to split the difference and give it a 5 for the following reasons:Pros: 1) that the film was in Latin and Aramaic made for an authentic linguistic experience of Roman occupied Palestine. Unlike other American films where foreigners choose to speak to each other, not in their native tongue, but in English, this film did it right. 2) The set made for an accurate portrayal of what Jerusalem was like almost 2000 years ago. 3) The acting was superb and I didn't feel like any one actor didn't fit the part or give a good performance. Granted when the acting is done in a language that few people speak or understand anymore, it's hard to tell if an acting job is over the top or bad, but I still thought it was very good. 4) The special effects were very realistic and never did I feel like that aspect looked faked or poorly done. 5) Satan was given a very well placed role in the film and he showed up just at the right times and with the correct frequency. 6) The cinematography was excellent and really enjoyed some of the amazing landscapes, especially the opening scene of Christ in the forest with his disciples - it really set the mood that something awful was looming on the horizon.Cons: 1) The torture and crucifixion scenes were brutal and, in my opinion, excessive. I understand the need to show the violence that Jesus experienced at the hands of the Romans so viewers could appreciate that he died for the sins of man in an excruciating manner, but it felt it was unnecessary to show every whip, slash, and slice of His flesh. 10 minutes of his torture and execution would have been sufficient enough to convey Jesus' pain and suffering to the audience, but unfortunately it's the majority of content of this film. If you don't care to see graphic violence, then this film is not for you. 2) As I just stated, the brutal violence seemed to really overshadow whatever other message Mel Gibson was trying to convey. There was so much gore, it was hard to see this film as nothing but a cinematic experience of the torture of Christ. Yes, I understood about 20 minutes into the film that Christ went through unspeakable pain and suffering for our sins, but there was a point where I said, ""Enough already!! I get it!!"". 3) The Jews in this film were shown in a pretty unflattering light. I came away thinking that they were nothing more than sadistic sociopaths whose only mission was to eliminate Christ no matter what the cost. And given Mel Gibson's anti-semitic comments when he was arrested for a DUI in LA, it's not surprising he portrayed the Jewish leaders the way he did in The Passion. 4) The Romans seemed to be a little too joyful when they were torturing Christ. There were a few brief moments of sympathy by some Roman soldiers, but I have a hard time believing that all of them could be that brutal, sadistic, and cold for the entire movie. I very much doubt they would be that one-dimensional for the whole movie. 5) The flashbacks of Christ talking to his disciples were a nice insight into Christ's mind and who he was, but there were far too few of these scenes in the film. Like I said before, this seemed to be a torture film with a few tidbits of Christ's life thrown in here and there. If the torture scene to flashback scene ratio would have been reversed, it would have been much more effective and celebrated his life rather than exploiting and showing an extremely graphic experience of his death.So, this is why I gave The Passion a 5. I thought it was an okay film, but it could have been much better. I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either. As I said before, if you cannot stomach extremely graphic and sadistic violence, then this film is something you should avoid. Also, I don't think you should go into this film thinking that you will get an answer to how Jesus lived, but you will definitely get an answer as to the manner of how he died.",The Passion of the Christ
746,nimmy1,"Brutal, yet mesmerizing - upsetting, yet uplifting.",10,31 August 2004,"To people who criticize this film for not showing anything about Jesus's teachings or life, let me point out it is the PASSION of the Christ; not the teachings of the Christ or the life of Christ; as such does what it set out to do well - especially the Crucifixion scene.For those people who criticize this film for being too graphic - what injuries do you think 39 lashes with a flagellun are likely to cause a scratch? being beaten, mocked and crucified - a bad head? If anything the end of Jesus would have been much more brutal. It could take days to die on a cross (jewish people had to have their legs broken to speed up death); yet Jesus was too weak to carry His Cross the whole way and die after a few hours - the unwitting testimony here is that Jesus was probably two therds dead when He was executed. It's not as graphic as it's reputation suggest (for instance, a lot of the Roman whipping is actually done of camera).Therefore, assuming Mel Gibson assumed most people had some Knowledge of the life and teachings of Jesus he chose to concentrate on the suffering of Jesus which as been somewhat watered down over the years.This he has done superbly - brutal, yet mesmerizing, upsetting, yet uplifting.",The Passion of the Christ
747,chadrbailey-1,Heart-wrenching play on historically dubious sources,6,12 January 2005,"I cried through about half the movie. It really shook me to my core. As I left the theater, a gentleman in his later 50's or early 60's wearing fur and escorting a fur-swathed woman of similar age, must have noted my being upset, even angry, and approached me saying, ""reverence."" What am I supposed to make of that? Although the depiction of the brutality of Jesus' treatment really rocked me, I definitely left the theater with the idea that the film was trying to define for me the pointlessness and futility of life. The film provided no historically relevant antecedent to explain Jesus' treatment. And I'm religious. The only thing that the subtext implied was that the temple authorities really didn't like him. No Roman source of persecution (Pilate and the guards really were just passive instruments carrying out the stereotyped eschatological role they're purported to have played). Even with the templar persecution, the film left me with only the core doctrine that ""Christ, an innocent, died for the sins of the world."" But doctrine doesn't engage, or make history. The Gospels were never intended as history (rather, as ""good news""). Many historians (heathens that they are and must be for not accepting as literal the written canonical gospels) have come to believe in a different history, supported by historical documentation. First, Pontius Pilate was historically a cruel, heartless proconsul in what was at the time a Roman backwater. Second, Jesus and the Pharisees weren't so far apart in religious practice as the movie depicts: the Pharisees very much encouraged bringing the heart of religious practice into the home and personal life, and away from the temple itself. Jesus provided a life and message more radical than what the Pharisees taught, but in life he was probably much influenced by their teachings. Third, there were many people in pre-70 AD Jerusalem running around claiming to be the messiah, why did the ""authorities"" despise Jesus so? Fourth, in the economic system of the 1st century AD, the Hebrews were highly impoverished, and the Temple taxed them heavily such that poor farmers mostly supported a garish elite in the temple. Fifth, Jesus wasn't exactly respectful of the temple (Mark 14: 58, etc.) and such behavior could have threatened the economic order of the time. Sixth, the ""it's in the blood"" theology of modern times is a relatively recent phenomenon, despite citations in Paul's letters to the contrary. The history of religious thinkers, from St. Basil, St. Gregory of Nyssia, Peter Abelard, and on... don't reflect this late 2nd millennium version of things.Anyway, there's more to be said about history, but the movie doesn't even rely on the gospels themselves. Instead, it relies on the visions of Anne Katherine Emmerich, who lived fairly recently to fill in some of the historical incompatibilities between the gospels. Overall, the movie does a great job of tugging the heart strings, but may not lead people toward truth.",The Passion of the Christ
748,42ndStreetMemories,In Your Face Religion,3,27 February 2005,"Yes it spotlights the final hours of Christ. Peiod. The film assumes that the viewer has an understanding of the circumstances and the individuals involved. So all we are subjected to is the violence of the final hours.Why? I don't care to get into the debates, hype, propaganda. First, it is a film. What are you looking for in a film. Entertainment? Time Killer? Educational? Having completed 16 years of Catholic education, I was fully aware of the brutality. So it was not educational for me. As a film geek, I did see or hear anything new in the presentation. The cinematography and score are fine. But nothing stood out. The actors do not have much to work with. Minimal dialog, no emotional pacing. Sledge hammer presentation by the director even though it is more than technically competently put together.This is in-your-face violence like nothing I have scene before. Peckingpah I'm sure has been mentioned in context with a lot of the opinions posted here. Peckingpah used violence to set up or exclamation-point a plot line. Here the violence is the plot line.No film can sustain two hours of comedy, romance, pathos. And certainly, a suspense film needs to build its suspense. This film does not attempt to build. It is the final hours. Period.All we needed was Cinerama, 3-D, Imax to get the complete feeling that we were there.I believe that Passion of the Christ would have worked for me if the suspense and drama had built beyond its initial 15 minutes. The violence would have had more affect if I had more feeling for the characters other than what I learned in school many years ago. The final hours were more than the torture of Christ.

It's impossible to convey a completely accurate picture of what Jesus went through in his final hours, but this is as close to ""real"" as you can get. The scene when the first nails are driven, Mary Magdalene crying hysterically in the background, is the most gut wrenching scene I've ever seen in a movie and I've seen a lot.

The film amounts to nothing but a long boring rant in which you are told over the entire running time that ""Jesus suffered"". I know that it hurts to be crucified! I know that Jesus suffered for our sins! So what are you left with...nothing. The entire film should be the climax of a more interesting film. The running time could be cut in half if only Mel Gibson had cut the endless slow motion shots of Jesus falling over. Christians love the film because it voyeuristically hammers home the fact that Jesus suffered, it confirms their beliefs and they believe hammers it home to others. This is is why i call the film propaganda, it serves no other purpose but to scream ""look how he suffered for you""! Plus the film is amazingly anti-Semitic! Mel Gibson believes that the Bible is the word of God, but he changes it in order to cast the Jewish people in the worst possible light.

It is hardly a ""'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' on Golgotha"", but it is grueling enough.  Although crafted from Gibson's unique perspective as a pre-Vatican II Catholic, ""Passion"" seems to have resonated with many viewers from widely differing sectarian backgrounds.  I write as a traditional Catholic and I did not find the film overly wrought with wretched excess (well, the crow plucking out the eye of the ""bad"" thief on the cross was a bit over the top).  What got me most, frankly, was Jim Caviezel's performance as the most accessible and approachably human Christ ever put on screen.  The nearly unremitting horror of Christ's passion is punctuated by a number of rather sweet flashbacks which illustrate a Christ who works up a sweat while carpenting and who cracks jokes with his mom--playfully splashing a bit of water on her as she calls him in for lunch.

Some are going to call it a masterpiece no matter what they actually think about it as a film simply because of the subject matter. Others will call it trash for the same reason.That said, and religion aside, this was a powerfully moving, fairly disturbing, beautifully made film. I thought the film was an amazing, that's the best word I can sum it up with. Yes, it's violent, no, it's not for everyone. The direction, acting, cinematography, and score are all excellent, and it looks like a much higher budgeted film than the $25-$30 million that it cost.My only real problem with the film is that Jesus' ministry and resurrection (which are the real points) are settled in short snippets. That, though, I can easily forgive as I realize that that wasn't the point. Gibson has said he made the film so that people will realize the enormity of the sacrifice, and in that he succeeded.The much spoken about ""pornographic violence"" has been blown incredibly out of proportion. Yes, the film's violent, but no worse than ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""We Were Soldiers"". In those films, the violence was praised for adding realism. It's odd that it is a major point of criticism with this film. I actually found the most disturbing parts of the violence to be the shots where you couldn't see Jesus suffering. Hearing the whips but seeing only Jesus' chained hands or his mother Mary's face were much harder to watch then his bloody back.Also, with the even more spoken about alleged anti-semitism of the film, I saw none. If you go in wanting to see it then you probably could, but what is there is a few of the Jewish leaders wanting Jesus out of the way, and that is where mob mentality kicks in. It has nothing to do with jews being in the crowd.I saw it as an amazing film that wasn't quite flawless, but was also not as masochistic and shallow as others have claimed.The bottom line is, everyone will see this movie differently, and everyone will come out with different interpretations.

That does not, however, prevent me from enjoying a good picture with religious content. For example, one of my favorites is Ben Hur. That being said...This movie is just not that good. I'm sorry. Maybe I would feel differently if it held some deep religious meaning for me; but it doesn't. I can only judge this film on its own merits as a film. And on those merits, it's only mediocre.My problem is that it's so heavy handed that it's almost unwatchable. The film is about two hours, and fully one hour is nothing but a vicious beating. If Jesus existed and if he was crucified, I'm sure that the torture that he experienced went on much longer than an hour. But this is a dramatic film, not a documentary. Therefore we need some serious time compression.There's no real character development. I know that sounds odd, but as someone that's not a Christian and is therefore slightly unfamiliar (I have read a good portion of the Bible, but it's been years), I could have used a little setup before we jump straight into the fire, as it were.Satan seemed very contrived and totally not in step with the rest of the film. The Satan scenes were so much different than the rest of the picture that they jerked me out of the story.Now that I've got gripes out of the way, I'll tell you what I liked. Stylistically, the film was very good. I liked the cinematography, lighting, look-and-feel, etc. I think that the costuming was great. The actors were very believable. Even the language--about which I was very dubious--was totally believable.In short, all the problems this film had were due to the director.

When the movie ended, no one moved or spoke while the credits played. According the scripture, the abuse, scourging and the crucifixion were needful to fulfill God's law, the price I could never pay. All through my life, I'd seen nothing but sanitized pictures of the ""passion of the Christ"" showing token abuse, scourging and crucifixion. To see these actually, vividly displayed drove the reality of what I had believed, but could never really describe, home. After watching it this time, this thought came to mind. Which thief on the cross would I have been? The one who mocked Jesus or the one who recognized He was sinless. In conclusion, absolutely, read the Bible, especially Psalms 22 and Isaiah 53 and the Gospel accounts of the ""passion"" of Jesus. View the movie in light of what the Bible does say. My prayer is you'll see Jesus, the sinless Son of God, Son of Man. PS When God created man, He gave Him a gift. It's called ""free will"". He did not want a bunch of robots running around. The results of all of human misery, is us exercising that gift. You have a free will to any opinion about this movie you like. You also have a free will to choose where you want to spend eternity. Choose wisely.",The Passion of the Christ
768,arabian_dracula,i was expecting more...!,6,25 June 2007,"I am not a Muslim if I don't believe and respect Jesus. It is binding upon every Muslim to respect Jesus as he is the Messenger of God and his name is mentioned in the Koran, in fact there is one complete chapter in Koran named after his mother ""Mary"". i was expecting a little more from the movie. the information i have about Jesus is the Muslim side of story but i wanted to know the Christian side of story as well. the movie is well stretched. it is a marvelous things to witness how the director has stretched a 15 minutes story into a 2 hour drama. i wanted to see more of Jesus's life and the involvement of his companions. We Muslims believe that he was not crucified but was lifted up towards the heaven and God had sent another man who looked like him to be crucified. We believe that Jesus will come before the Day of Judgement, he will rule on the earth and then he will die a natural death, because after all he is a human being like us. there are 1000's of similarities between Muslims, Christians and Jews, i wonder why do Christians and Jews keep on killing innocent Muslims. the movie i saw was in another language, i think it was Hebrew. i noticed many similarities between hebrew and arabic, which again points to cultural similarities between three leading religions of the world, i.e. Islam, Christianity & JUDAISM.

Now, this movie is just like those films released by Islamic extremists in the middle east, honoring their martyrs in the most tasteless manners. To me, its scary how so many educated people in a modern democracy (US) can see this film as spiritual/inspiring.Any modern Christian owe it to their god and faith to strongly dissociate from this film, as it if anything spits on Christ work. And how can you say that this is NOT against any special group of people by saying ""i just follow whats written in the bible""? The bible says a lot of things: Gays should be killed, women must sacrifice animals to cleanse them from the sin of menstruation and religious doubt must be punished with extreme torture. Gibson choose what parts of the bible he wanted to stress and must stand by this.If you choose to look at this film completely non-religiously, it's just very pointless.

770,BLawson-1,Should have been rated NC-17,3,2 March 2004,"Walked out 2/3's of the way through this movie.  Couldn't handle the overdone, extreme violence (which says something because I can go see a 'slasher' movie and it will have no effect on me).  What I would like to say without being too controversial is... ""Yet another display or act of violence condoned in the name of Religion.""  If this had been about any other subject, any other person, it would have been condemned by the public for the extremes it went to in it's portrayals.  Comon', 15 long graphic minutes straight of beating Jesus.  I get the point!!!  Move on with it Mel! It really should have been rated NC-17 rather than just R.  On the other hand, maybe I should have stuck out the final third of the movie to see if there was something other than 2 hours of beatings, slashings, blood, guts, pain, hate, etc was going to come out of it.  As I walked out of the theater, the next theater over which had just shown the same movie had just let out, and I could have sworn I was standing outside the World Trade Center the morning of 9/11 just before it's collapse.

771,drake blueskull,"Upside: Intense, Stirring ...Flipside: Loud, Singular in focus",8,14 May 2004,"Passion is brutally intense but it isn't macabre. Indeed, chances are that you wouldn't come across a film as violent as this but as you watch it, you would find it hard to escape the subliminal meaning it seeks to impress. This movie seems to have taken it upon itself to stir the collective Christian conscience and there can be no doubt that it does manage to do so. Ironically, it is this factor that immediately takes it away from the realms of entertainment, something that we've come to expect' of the films we watch. You can rest assured that this isn't a movie you'd enjoy sitting through. Moreover, the focus of the movie is so singular that it makes a very dissimilar impact on non-christian audiences including myself. There have been many movies, which rely heavily upon cultural & religious aspects causing a polarity of opinion amongst those who cannot relate to them. In such a case we detach ourselves from those nuances and concentrate instead on factors, which are more universal in their appeal. I believe that the story of Christ has a universal appeal. If passion was invested with that element then I couldn't find it. I get the message, thank you very much, but the trouble it goes through to convey it makes me doubt my ability to do so. However, this is merely an observation that can cause endless debate serving no purpose whatsoever. What matters is that the movie did compel me to look beyond its theological foundation and be influenced by its underlying spirituality. After watching Passion I knew why I would've wanted to watch it and that, I guess, is enough.Jim Caviezel portrays Jesus Christ in his final hours (notice the coincidence in the initials of the name  JC) . From a purely artistic perspective the film did not really demand versatility of expression, since he's to enact pain alone & besides his looks somehow complement the character. Still he manages to make his effort felt. The trick, I suppose, is to be convincing enough to blind us to the difference between the reality and the illusion of pain. Jim secures that to his credit. Technically speaking, the sets and the looks of the film do remind us of that time. The make up, in one word, is ground breaking. Wounds borne by Christ were meant to remind us of the burden of sin. Such astounding attention to gore has to be lauded because the intent extends to causing catharsis. The lack thereof would take away the point of making this giant of an effort.
There is something loud about Passion. It thrives on extremes that, I believe, haven't been portrayed in any movie about Christ. This makes Gibson's film special but not exactly transcendent. The idea of expression is concerned only with conveying a message that could be social, political or ideological. Take your pick. Sadly, there is nothing more to it. Partly because there can be nothing more to it. Yet these are the very peculiarities that make the movie worthwhile. This movie is what it means to be. It does what it means to do. There is precious little to be questioned about its blood soaked texture. This is not a movie that essentially wants to be violent, but rather needs to be violent. The message that Christ died for our sins carries a burden of meaning with it. Mel Gibson seems to understand that to say the least.",The Passion of the Christ
772,robot_rollcall,This is a terrible movie,1,25 November 2010,"I don't want to talk about the Bible. I don't want to talk about religion. I don't want to talk about Jesus Christ.I want to talk about a movie. This movie.I don't know why I added the spoiler tag. If you live in America, you already know the story. However, imagine for a moment that you had never heard of Jesus Christ. Would you care about this movie then? Would it even make any sense to you? Think about that seriously for a moment. If you didn't know the story already, would you still understand this movie? This movie doesn't have a plot and it barely has any characters. Jesus spends 90% of the movie writhing around like a zombie, spewing blood everywhere and gargling at the camera. During the few moments when he's actually speaking his performance is completely flat. His only good scene was in the opening. Mary spends the whole movie looking sad, which is understandable, but James just stands around stoically and barely sheds a tear, like he doesn't even care that his brother is getting crucified. The Jews act more like rabid dogs than human beings; their portrayal is simply disgusting. Even the Romans barely show a trace of humanity.THIS IS A SNUFF FILM.I honestly laughed every time Satan appeared on screen, because it seemed so out of place and his make-up was so over the top. He looked like Voldemort from Harry Potter. The only way he could have looked more ridiculous is if they dressed him up in horns and red body paint.It's painfully obvious what the focus of this movie really is: the graphic torture and death of Jesus Christ. That's why the plot and characters are missing. They take up too much space. I couldn't believe that this film spent a full 30 minutes on the crucifixion alone. Even Jesus's teachings, what should arguably have been the focus of this film, got very little screen time compared to his torture. I knew what I was in for when I started this movie. I just didn't expect it to suck this much.",The Passion of the Christ
773,Xianghong,"Sad to say, the only lesson that I learnt from this movie is never to get on the bad side of God.",7,2 February 2015,"Hoping to stir up some semblance of a spark in the void that is my spirituality, this atheist eagerly sat through what is supposedly the most accurate and poignant depiction of the last hours of Christ. I left utterly disappointed, with the hollow feeling that usually follows from watching a Hollywood blockbuster. Believe me, if you're seeking some form of enlightenment in your spiritual journey, go spend your $8.50 on The Gospel of John instead. There is a Spanish saying: A mal Cristo, mucha sangre or ""A badly made Christ needs lots of blood"". Apparently, Mel ""Mad Max"" Gibson hasn't lost his penchant for uncompromising graphic displays of carnage since Braveheart and The Patriot, and acting as a man in touch with his feminine side in What Women Want didn't seem to help much either. Having finally watched the polemical production, allow me to briefly comment on the two major controversies surrounding this movie, hopefully without stirring up a hornet's nest.Firstly, the burning question: who really killed Jesus Christ? Or to put it more succinctly, is the movie anti-Semitic? I would say so, in the sense that Gibson has directed the focus of accusation by portraying Pontius Pilate as the sympathetic governor who was pushed by the temple elite and Jewish mob to persecute the Messiah. This is not likely to be historically accurate but the very fact that The Passion has been lauded for its Biblical accuracy (which I agree with) indicates that the fault lies not on the film, but the book it's based on. Certainly, there was no significant indication in the movie of the notion that we are all culpable for the death of Christ, as what Gibson claims. Forgive me; I don't have a PhD in theology, which is probably why the concept of my responsibility for the death of a man two thousand years ago escapes me. Also, since blaming the Jews makes the film anti-Semitic, wouldn't blaming the entirety of mankind make it anti-humanity?Secondly, is the movie overtly zealous in its portrayal of the alleged suffering of Christ, to the point of overshadowing the original message of sacrifice and redemption? Definitely. The Flagellation and Crucification scenes had me flinching and squirming involuntarily in my seat. In the former scene, one Roman legionary had his weapon, a cat 'o nine tails, embedded in the left midsection of Jesus, which he savagely ripped out, spraying blood and gore all over the ground, to the grim satisfaction of Satan in the curious form of an old woman and Mini- Me. A friend commented, ""Jesus must be a walking blood bank!"" when he saw Christ dripping his divine plasma all the way to the execution site, after the horrible bloodletting from the flogging session. I wonder how many gallons of fake blood Gibson had to purchase and whether he consulted Quentin Tarantino for the best deals.The main problem I see with The Passion of The Christ is not with its (almost sadistic) emphasis on suffering. It is its potential for use as a tool for promulgating racial and religious intolerance that worries me. Already, various hate-groups and the religious right are brandishing this proverbial double-edged sword to promote and justify their own bigoted ideology. Its possible use for glorification of martyrdom cannot be ignored either in light of the recent spate of suicidal religious fanaticism. In the context of a multicultural society like Singapore, it is especially dangerous if employed to incite religious antagonism. As a matter of fact, I am particularly surprised that the usually heavy-handed Censorship Board assigned it a rating of M18 instead of R(A), since it is arguably every bit as violent (if not more) as Kill Bill. After all, the latter may have been awash in gratuitous violence, but it was certainly not meant to be taken seriously.Sad to say, the only lesson that I learnt from this movie is never to get on the bad side of God. The poor thief who had his eye gouged out by the holy crow in addition to being crucified really (forgive me) drove the point in. Other than that, I must admit The Passion of The Christ deserves kudos for the commendable cinematographic skills of Caleb Deshanel, Mel Gibson and Ben Fitzgerald for a plot that cleverly avoids certain tricky or contradictory passages in the Gospels, John Debney for a stirring and magnificent soundtrack, and everybody else for creating unprecedented and unmerited amounts of hype. But then again, I couldn't expect any less from this unique juxtaposition of Hollywood and religion. The only exception would be (thank God) that there won't be a sequel. My advice for anybody intending to watch the show: take it with a pinch of salt and don't get too passionate about it.",The Passion of the Christ
774,jude2348,"Abhorrent, repellent, gratuitously violent, this is neither Christianity nor truth.",1,17 April 2004,"I am unsure of the motivation behind the making of this film - if is to promote Christianity, then it does a very poor job.  The opposite, I think. If it is to tell the ""truth"", then it fails.I have serious concerns about the mental health of someone who can take half a dozen words - ""when he had scourged him"" (St Mark) and turn it into a 20-minute blood and violence fest.  And again: ""he was taken to the place of execution"" - another 20 minutes of vicious brutality.I thought the whole point of Christianity is that Christ was a man - and no man, no matter how stoic, could have survived a fraction of this.Do not go and see this film - it is abhorrent in its gratuitous violence.",The Passion of the Christ
775,FilmWatcha,"An Immaculate, Visually-told Film",10,6 March 2004,"The Passion of the Christ is a very unique film to review. It is not told through dialogue, nor it is really one of those films with any extended talking at all. It's basically a visual tour of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ, and at that it is a masterpiece. To note: this movie isn't really for entertainment. It's a work of faith, as another IMDB reviewer put it. Don't expect a fun trip.Acting: The acting in this film is nothing sort of brillant. The majority (or all; I'm not sure)the dialogue in this movie is in either Latin or Armaic (with subtitles) but the intense emotion in every shot shines through to any langauge. Much of the drama consists of facial expressions and body movements (esp. of Jesus Christ suffering), and the feeling of the scene are powerful enough to smack you.Story: Generally, this film is a condensed version of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ as told in the Bible. Everything is told in a powerful, brutal way, and is very well done.Visuals: This is the essense of the film. Beautiful cineamotgraphy (I apologize for the poor spelling), horrifying beatings, and spirtual scene setups make for a great movie.

776,The_Maniacal_Dr_Poohfinger,Jesus who?,6,31 March 2004,"a little character development might have been nice. this film failed in that it took one of the greatest figures in history, and totally stripped him of any real importance.  instead of a character, we get an icon, spewing mystical and mindless rhetoric, and not a man whose philosophy and ideas for social reform are still relevant 2000 years after his death.  this was a movie brimming with cardboard cut outs in the stead of actual characters, and made little sense to anyone who is not wholly familiar with the new testament.  ok, so the high priests want him dead. why?  because he preached to the working class and proclaimed to be the son of god?  hardly.  a dozen profits and madmen a day would have made similar claims to the same demographic.  it was the ideas of jesus that led to his death in that his preachings were beginning to undermine the power and wealth of those in control at the time.  this movie is just another cop out jesus-flick that depends too much on the crutch of the religious angle and refuses to depict him as an actual man whose revolutionary ideas lead to his death.  this said, the passion was a well enough crafted film for the budget, although it seemed to rely too heavily on the slow motion and overdramatic music, likening it to a hollywood action film, a la uber-hack mike bay, which was completely inappropriate.  gibson is severely limited as a director, and it shows in this overbearing, soggy-bottomed grab bag of heavy handed imagery and pomp.",The Passion of the Christ
777,Identification,One of the best films I have ever seen,10,26 May 2004,"Personally, I believe this film is one of the best and most moving films ever made. I went into the theater with an open mind. I told myself, ""I will watch and not judge; if it's truly horrible and totally inaccurate, it's only a movie.""I needn't have worried.Historical accuracy is almost perfect. The entire film appears to follow exactly as I knew the tale. Visually, it was beautiful. From the ""curse"" children (who made me startle) to the storm above the crucifixion, from the image of Satan in all demonic brilliance, to Mary herself, everything seemed to glow with the radiance that comes from truly beautiful film-making. I had tears in my eyes from the heart wrenching hurtfulness of it. It was the first time I ever cried in a theater, and that says something. It made me realize, seriously, how much Christ went through in that day. Yes, it's extremely graphic, but it needed to be seen. It made the audience sit up and watch.I am not a devout Christian, I don't attend church more than maybe once a year, and yet, this brought home with a true awakening what I really believe in, when I believe in Christ. I walked out of the theater a changed person. It made me want to make it worth it.In regards to the controversy, atheists, non-Christians... everybody has their own right to opinion. I've read so many comments on here about people who were unaffected... people who thought it was horrible... and, of course, people who thought it was a plague upon the Earth, made by evil egotistical ********. (I am tempted to think such people would never recognize a good film, ever.) The bottom line is, Passion of the Christ changed my life, spiritually, emotionally, artistically. In every sense, The Passion of the Christ is everything a movie should be. The acting is powerful, the scenery is perfect, the score is flawless, the historical truth is as good as creative license allows, and it affected me deeply.My only word of advice: You only need to see it once, believe me.Ten out of ten.

779,poldemol,Let's keep it a bit objective please.,6,8 March 2005,"1. It was nominated for best original score for the Oscars. I couldn't quite believe that. Since the score is one of the most obnoxious, pretentious scores I've ever heard. The, I suppose it was meant to create a religious atmosphere, AUHMMMMMMMMMMM AUHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM AUHMMMMMMM-ing, I mean, how over the top can a score be? It doesn't help, that it's also played constantly throughout the whole movie, over-used would be a bit of an understatement I thought.2. The acting was OK. Although it didn't require much acting. Some over-acting on the part of the Romans and Jews, and the Pro Wrestler called Barabbas. But the main parts were OK. Caviezel is a fine actor. He groaned and moaned good, and he's able to look profound when he's just looking(check out the Thin Red Line for further proof). So he was a very good choice and gave a good performance, although he just had to look profound, and take the beatings. The devil was also in the picture. He had a maggot crawling out his nose, so we would recognise him. He also lives in a CGI hell. Where he sometimes goes nuts when Jesus dies. But that is more for the directors account.3. The cinematography is very good, even excellent. Every shot just looks great, except for maybe the CGI hell. Still, it's easily the best thing about the movie. (I wouldn't have mind an Oscar nomination for that)4. The Plot, well, Jesus gets captured because of Judas who kills himself, Jesus gets sentenced, Jesus gets crucified, eventually dies, and resurrects. Constant beatings occur from the capturing to the crucifixion(the largest part of the movie). His friends and family are present too, but can't really help. The devil is around too, he mostly just looks devilish. I would call that a pretty thin plot. Oh yeah, I forgot, somehow Jesus also invented the modern table, when he was younger. Something I learned thanks to this movie.5. The effects were average. They were very good, when he gets beat up. The blood, the wounds, look very realistic. But when the Romans put a sphere into his side, when he's on the cross. The bag filled with buckets of blood that splatters open, looks very fake, almost like a bag filled with buckets of blood that splatters open. Also the CGI Hell, looked very CGI. But overall, the effects, were good.I gave the movie a 6/10. It's a visually OK. But most things are way too overdone for my taste.",The Passion of the Christ
780,Gremlin1701,One of the greatest ever,10,21 March 2004,"This review may contain a spoiler for those utterly unfamiliar with the story.I think I understand why a large segment of critics did not like this movie. Not to mention that segment of the general public that didn't care for it. When people go to movies, they go to be entertained.  In fact, that's why I go, so I do not fault people for this.  At least, not in general terms.Anyone who thought this movie would be intended for entertainment purposes is a fool.  The same goes for anyone who would feel that knowing the end would spoil the film.  You know who you are, and at this point you aren't reading this article anyway.  Now I know that there are some who will say that I am going to blame the anti-religious Left for being what they are and trying to destroy a masterpiece of a film.  However, I've seen regular-guy reviews on this site from all manner of people -- to include self-described atheists -- who feel the same way I did about the film.  That it was a masterpiece.  And it is.  The Passion was undoubtedly the best religious movie ever.  And one could argue that based upon its writing, its realism, and, well, the story itself, that it is one of the top five films ever to come out of Hollywood.  The main thing here is mindset.  There are a few things to do for yourself before seeing this movie for the first time.  First: Disavow yourself of any notion that this film is intended to entertain, even in the most perverse sense.  Watching a man be nearly flogged to death is not a pleasant sight. Period.  The movie is intended to provoke thought, to evoke emotion, and to portray a well known story in as accurate a manner as is possible 1,975 years later (by most accounts).  Second: Don't go in expecting to be surprised.  There are probably about 15 people over the age of 2 in the United States who have not heard the story at least once in passing.  This goes for Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Agnostics, Atheists, Miscellaneous Pagans, etc., etc. as well as Christians. Yes, Gibson put in a few things based upon Poetic License, and he left out some lines that I wouldn't have, but none of that takes away from the story, and by the time you get well into the trial and torment, those instances are forgotten.  All of that having been said, the meat of the story sticks almost exactly to the story as told in the four Gospels (a point of contention, according to the ""Hollywood Reporter."")  Third: understand that the Subtitles are important, and this is one of the very few cases when having the movie in another language actually does add to the experience.  It all seems a little more real when you hear it in Latin and Aramaic.  One of the things that really surprised me about the film was that as sad as it was, it didn't leave me depressed, and as gruesome as it was, I wasn't sickened.  Did I cry?  No.  I'm usually stoic (some might say callous) about movies.  I will admit, though that there were a couple of points where I had to hold back tears.  It's the nature of the film.  As is the fact that I spent the time during the 20 minute ride home from the film in silence. Nothing on the radio could possibly be as important as what had been depicted on that screen.One final thought, and this is directed at the people who are reading this in defiance of my statement that you wouldn't make it this far.  (You know who you are.)  All of the complaints about the movie: It's too violent; it follows the Bible too closely (Yes, folks, that has been a complaint); it is Anti-Semitic; It's not sufficiently in line with what modern historians think happened, etc.  All of those complaints are totally invalid.  Yes the movie is violent, but, as gruesome as it is, it is not gratuitous.  Jesus ACTUALLY went through what is depicted here, at least according to Scripture.  Yes, the movie follows Scripture.  That was the point.  Why is it that a movie is not allowed to be made that actually tries to be accurate where it regards Christianity?  ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" a butchery of everything Christians hold dear, gets rave reviews, and something that tries to tell the tale as it was meant to be told is panned by several (though not all) critics.  No, nothing was dwelled upon vis a vis Pontius Pilate's Cruelty toward the people during his reign in Judah, or the poverty of the masses in Jerusalem, or the Thoughts of the Sanhedrin regarding Jesus, Rome, or whatever else.  That's because this wasn't ""Pearl Harbor."" Gibson didn't use the momentous event of the Crucifixion as the backdrop of some other story.  ""The Passion of the Christ"" is centered on the Passion of the Christ.  And, no, the film was not, in any way, Anti-Semitic.  Anyone who would use this movie as a basis for the hatred of Jews doesn't need a basis for the Hatred of Jews.  That hatred is already, irrevocably in their hearts.  They don't -- and won't -- get that all that happened HAD to happen and that we should probably thank those who actively participated in the Crucifixion because it led to the Resurrection. Besides that, the portrayal of Jews was balanced between the mobs drummed up by the Pharisees and the people who tried to help, and wept for his suffering, and stood up for his dignity if nothing else.",The Passion of the Christ
781,FirstBlood1982,The best example I've ever seen of a movie that feels like art in motion...,10,10 July 2020,"My annual Good Friday tradition since its release on 2/25/2004.The best example I've ever seen of a movie that feels like art in motion...bringing to life beautiful paintings of Christ's Passion before the eyes of the viewer to create the most intense and deeply affecting look at the essence of Christ's redemptive sacrifice that anyone has been able to experience within the past two thousand years...far surpassing any other film, live performance, or any other artistic expression on the subject matter.Definitely the single most powerful and important film of my lifetime that should be seen both by believers and by those that value the artistic side of cinema. Every shot in this film makes you feel like you're inside of a renaissance painting (inspired by the likes of Caravaggio and Michelangelo).In addition to being the first movie to give a raw look at the degree to which Christ suffered for humanity that was not overly sanitized, this also conveys the idea of spiritual welfare as poignantly as I've ever seen on film...drawing Biblical allusions to Genesis and Satan's temptation of Christ to add crucial thematic context from the very beginning...and this is quite possibly the best movie at showing the humanity of Christ without diminishing His divinity, depicting a beautiful mother & son relationship that anyone can relate to.It also offers insight into the heated political climate between the Romans and the Jewish Sanhedrin at the time, with one of the most thought provoking looks at the moral dilemma of Pontius Pilate when Jesus is brought to him for sentencing.The directing, editing, acting, Middle Eastern inspired music score, cinematography, production design, visual/prosthetic effects, authentic languages from the era, etc... give this movie as much attention to detail as you could ever hope to see/hear onscreen to create an unforgettable emotional and visceral experience (as well as a spiritual one, for those of us open to its message).A medieval Passion play in the form of a masterfully crafted, unparalleled cinematic achievement unlike anything modern viewers have ever been able to experience before...culminated by arguably the most Biblically accurate and powerful depiction of Christ's Resurrection to date...which may be the single most uplifting, awe inspiring final shot in the history of cinema.""Surely He took up our pain and bore our suffering,
yet we considered Him punished by God, stricken by Him, and afflicted.But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on Him, and by His wounds we are healed.We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.""
Isaiah 53:4-6 (NIV)""He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.""When they hurled their insults at Him, He did not retaliate; when He suffered, He made no threats. Instead, He entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly.""He Himself bore our sins"" in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; ""by His wounds you have been healed.""For ""you were like sheep going astray,"" but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

783,yonatan-nir,one of the most boring movies ever,2,8 January 2011,"At first i had my doubts about seeing this movie, since I'm Jewish and this movie had a lot of publicity as an antisemitic movie. I'll just say that even as a Jewish person, I don't understand why someone would say there was something antisemitic in this movie. I think the Romans were portrayed a lot worse than the Jewish. But nevertheless, it wasn't what eventually led me to give a vote of only 2 out of 10. What can i say.. the movie is plain boring, mostly It's second hour. The entire movie just shows the Romans beat up Jesus and torture him but that's it. There is no real story to the movie, just some beatings. I don't see why someone would think this movie is emotional... just because you see some guy get tortured then you feel the urge to cry? I'm sorry but i don't see a point in this. Furthermore, I think that in the end Jesus was also portrayed more as a crazy man than of someone who is actually the ""son of god"". I also got a feeling in the end where he suddenly resurrected that the movie makers did it only to keep the story as it was written in the bible because it seems more like science fiction to me.",The Passion of the Christ
784,Wisler,The divine and the profane: art at it's finest.,10,26 February 2004,"To merely write here that I truly loved this film may be rather trivial. It is true, I do love this film. However, I think each person should see this film and formulate their own opinion. This is the healthiest thing to do. And I understand if some may not care for this film. I do think, nevertheless, that the only way someone could view this movie as anti-Semitic is if in their own hearts they already have such horrible feelings and do not open themselves to the experience of this film. As for me, I was keenly aware that it was my sin that nail Jesus to the cross. I cannot, and will not speak for anyone else. It is not my place to do so. I speak only on my behalf, a sinner saved by grace.I must also add that The Passion of the Christ is some of the best filmmaking I have ever seen. Whether one likes the movie or not, I think it should be recognized that the art of this film, the cinematography, editing, acting, make-up, set design, directing, soundtrack, lighting, sound effects... in truth, all elements of filmmaking were at their finest in this film.To me, a foundational reason this film is so good is because of the marriage of the divine and the profane. This is the central point in my Christian faith: that God became man and died for my sins. Once again, I understand if some people do not connect with this aspect of the story or care much for it. Each person should form their own opinion on this. I believe this film powerfully displays the struggled and suffering Christ endured. It is violent! Yet, it is beautiful! This is the divine and the profane. I hope this will help others who have long believed in Christ to understand that our place in this world is not to run from it, not to hide from it, not to hate it, not to stand against it, not to judge it. Love is the message. And love means dealing with all the ugly, hurtful, profane things in this world. See this film. Then go, ponder these things, and live differently.Sincerely, Mikel J. Wisler",The Passion of the Christ
785,dave8436,Worth the price of admission,9,26 February 2004,"I expect to be entertained for a couple of hours and try to limit my experiences to those movies that will meet or come close to my expectations based on these and other reviews, trailers, word of mouth, etc...and if I also get some redeeming message, then so much the better.  For Passion, however, I did not expect to be entertained and was not disappointed.  The movie does not entertain as much as shock or horrify one with its violence, but the message in this movie clearly is worth the price of admission.  I won't go into the message since others have done it much more eloquently than I ever could.After reading an number of other reviews and articles in the press, I suspect there will be three distinct classes of reviews:  1) Most Christians will think this movie is the best movie since sliced bread.  This group will make it a financial success without any help from others; 2) Non-Christians (except Jews) and non-believers who will view it as a propaganda piece and give it bad reviews at every opportunity; and 3) Jews who will generally declare it anti-semetic regardless of its historical significance (notice I did not say historical accuracy).  I certainly did not come out of this movie with any anti-semetic feelings and would suspect most others would not either.I gave it a 9/10.",The Passion of the Christ
786,Johnny_halbarad,Two times i cried...,10,12 March 2004,"I did read a lot about ""The passion of the christ"", because there was a lot to read. The movie made history before it came to cinemas. In every comment, in every news, in every text about this film, there were the words violence and touching.Yesterday evening i watched this film. I try to be a christian, i really try to believe, and when i am dead, then i will know if i believed enough. But now to the film. The basic storyline begins at the one evening, at which Jesus begs god to not let him go through the crucifiction. And it ends with the resurrection. In between there are a lot of flashbacks. In those apr.90 minutes i expirenced the most touching, the most violent, the most terrifying and the best film i have ever seen. In the scene, where Jesus goes throug his first punishment, when the roman guys put away the sticks and take the whips, i startet to cry, because i thought, Jesus did this for us, he was innocent and went through this, in love for us. I did not read the bible and so i cannot judge if the jews really wanted so badly the dead of Jesus. And when i say the jews, i mean the ones 2004 years ago. And i am sure Mel Gibson did as well. During the crucifiction, when they hang out jesus' shoulder and hit in the second nail i startet to cry the second time. The pictures speak for themselves.I cannot think that there are some people who can watch this film and feel nothing, then they're not human.I believe, that Mel Gibson has achieved what he wanted, to remember people, why we are on this earth, because to pay back, what we all did to Jesus. In my Opinion, it is the best film ever, there is nothing that comes close to its strength and it isn't only strength because of violence, it is strength, because it is true.",The Passion of the Christ
787,nitzpitz,Is this comedy?,2,10 May 2004,"After hearing so much about this film, the whole controversy and the fact that the spoken languages where Aramaic and Latin I felt I had to see this picture for myself!No, I am not a Christian. I'm a Jew, and I was terribly annoyed by the fact that people said this movie was Anti-Semitic before even seeing it. Another reason for going!First of all let me say this; I don't think this movie is Anti-Semitic, the Romans are clearly the bad guys here. Yes, there are Jews who are being portrayed as villains, but most are just ordinary people, who are not guilty of Christ's death. This is unlike the Romans who are vulgar and sadistic except of course for the counselor's wife.Secondly, this is not the most violent film ever. I really didn't think that this movie was unwatchable. The sequence of the torturing does not last for 20 minutes, as I was told beforehand, but is alternated with scenes of both Maria's, and other people trying to see the 'show'.But what did I think of it??? I hate to admit that I couldn't stop laughing for most of the movie... The lighting, the colors, the moist on the body, the close-ups of tormented faces, were almost like coming out of the latest Bollywood production (no offence).The character of Christ, was absolutely non-believable to me. Jesus was shown as a dangerous sect leader in this movie, sacrificing himself to prove a point. I couldn't help seeing images of the Waco massacre while hearing Jesus speak. I did not get that feeling in other Passion movies, and was even moved by The Last Temptation of Christ, where genuine sacrifice was shown and not just meaningless masochism.Ok I will not even start to count all the historical inaccuracies of this production. Having chosen to use the languages originally spoken in the region, I mistakenly expected more!!! Two things really made me laugh though. First, the cross itself: If you intend to be historically incorrect, then please take it all the way!!!! Why let the other two carry only the horizontal part, like they really did in those days, and let Jesus carry a ""real"" cross. As if he could even carry it, anyone would have been dead long before, walking with three ribs out in the open. Second, the last supper is clearly a Jewish Passover Seider. There is no one who could deny that. But why use normal bread, Jesus ate unleavened bread like every other Jew on Passover.Two other things: - How could anybody stay that 'moist' in the heat and sand? - That last scene with the blood erupting from the body... That was hilarious!!!! I think Jesus looses at least 15 liters of blood during the movie, 3 times the amount an average person has...Isn't there anything good about this movie???Yes there is. I thought some camera angles, like when Jesus is being dragged after the torture and we see everything from his point of view (up-side-down) were very interesting and beautifully shot.I can't imagine this to be Mel Gibson message, but the devil was cool!!! Especially in a scene where the androgenic devil is shows as a contrast to Maria, carrying a little devil looking like a Madonna.Overall a mediocre movie with way too much impact on mankind.",The Passion of the Christ
788,atari-survey,What is this??,1,3 September 2004,"The whole film can be told with two sentences:You see Jesus getting whipped. Cut. You see Maria staring at him. Cut. And so on. That's actually the film.There's a lot of blood in the film due to the huge amount of whipping, but it's not as bloody as a chainsaw massacre and there's less fun watching it, so this film would actually lose against a simple horror-splatter-movie as both have no basic sense but are just confusing.My hope was to see some historical facts or at least some ""facts"" from the bible but you get nothing. Just whipping and screaming, no explanation, no background, nothing. And even the crucifying is shown totally wrong in the film: nobody ever slammed nails through the middle of the hands - the nails were placed just below the hand because otherwise it would have been a mess. And feet weren't nailed, too. That's a very simple example but it shows what we can expect for other details in the film (Herodes seems to be much to young, too).After all, they tried to get a depressing atmosphere and stole some brown colours from ""1984"" and fog from some chainsaw massacre. Yes, and this strange guy with the snake looked like the Star-Wars-Emperor in his younger days.I have to admit, when Pilatus asked who was to free - the murderer or Jesus, I had to laugh out loud saying ""Brian!"" :D ...and some other scenes like that...Well, or in one word: This film truly is crap. It even wouldn't have been good for an anti-drug campaign with all those hippies having consumed some kind of LSD, running around screaming like a paranoid.",The Passion of the Christ
789,weissbier,Devil!,2,11 March 2004,"I like the bible story but this movie is pathetic. No, I don't see anything ant-Semitic but only a bad movie. We see a lot of nonsense slow motions, 10 of which or so of a falling Jesus. It was loaded with sensation snatching effects. A cross, for example, doesn't groan like a sinking ship... Then there were a lot of continuity mistakes such as the ever traveling wounds over Jesus' body. Overall it was almost as boring as I.A.; nothing was left out to squeeze the lachrymal gland but even that it did not convincingly. Devil, the feeling is creeping on me that rating this movie ""10"" gives people the idea to ensure themselves of a space in heaven.",The Passion of the Christ

The entire cast especially Maia Morgenstern who plays Mary, gives outstanding performances, and Jim Caviezel is at his best. The amazing music gives extra emotion to the actors and to their dialogue.

And before you flip out, go read The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins. It basically states that the original blueprint for the New Testament was just the sayings of Jesus written down. The rest of it was created to convert more. That's right; all that the New Testament was supposed to be was what Jesus said. That said, this movie is just pure fiction. The beating Jesus took for the whips and cat-o-nine-tails alone would have killed him. Literally, every inch of his body was covered in some deep slash. Not to mention that every Jew save one and all Romans except Pontius Pilate were shown as bloodthirsty, hateful, angry, spitting Neanderthals did not help at all.

Yes yes, it is a movie, but I still felt like I could be right there.  Also, it is a passionate movie about forgiveness.  Many claim that this movie points fingers at who killed Christ, but it doesn't. What I saw was a powerful movie not meant to generate hate, but forgiveness.

Moviegoers have already seen Jesus as blood has been pour all over his body from all of the beatings.We already know that Jesus has really endured all of his pains and sufferings for us, as we live ourselves through our Christian lives, And that's what we do every Sunday. I think this happens to be a movie that time and again has been moved and changed several people's lives as they become true Christians. After the film, Several people have really did accept Jesus, and got themselves saved and baptized.

Its controversial and Mil is not short in that as well but when you see this you can't deny just how good he is.I also enjoyed how although the dialogue used is mainly old Aramaic, and some Hebrew and Latin but for me I managed to understand quite enough due to the similarity to Arabic which is my mother-tongue, sometimes using the exact same words we use and some very closely similar.Yes, its too violent, yes, its too dark and yes, its sometimes complex (if you don't know most story versions about what happened to prophet Isa / Jesus) but this is what the movie should be. The movie's plot is to show the suffering (from the point view of the story) that prophet Isa / Jesus went through in the last hours of his life and it is exactly what the movie gives.The way Gibson directed the movie from pacing, cinematography, visuals & effects (especially in the torture), editing, customs and make up excellence is just wonderful, and he managed to show that high level of brutality, this is his best work as director.Also, Performance of Jim Caviezel was outstanding. Managed with few words to give a fully emotional picture of what he was suppose to. He deserved not a win considering '08 movies but an Oscar nomination to show gratitude for his work.

The fact that Mel Gibson attempts it with such a reverie makes him more of a religious fanatic than a filmmaker.This is obvious by the form of the film itself, which is appropriately bland and unimaginative, succumbing to the usual mannerisms of the bored craftsmanship without any backbone to hold onto. Thus all visual intrigue here is simply a result of talented crewmembers trying to suggest expressive moments, laid around in discord, without a conductor to offer a point of view.One thing that he doesn't realize is a capital misconception of the philosophy behind Christ by the organized religion: instead of love, this film (and masses throughout the millennia) are attracted only to hatred and violence: as if that without putting up a show of gore there's just no way to get any attention.The plain fact that the only memory of this film is hatred, ridicules not only the one of the biggest world religions, but also the ethics of any human being capable of common sense.

It was one of the best pieces of ""filmed art"" I have ever seen.  It's like Michelangelo's The Pieta...a work of art. If there can be any complaints about it, they almost have to be political, though I believe the Jews who fear it miss the point.  However, any Christian who takes away from it that ""the Jews are at fault"" are also entirely missing Christ's point, since Mr. JC made it abundantly clear that it was his choice and no one had any power over him and none of the people doing it were at fault.  As a non-Christian, Non-Jew, I didn't see any politically or racially inflammatory anything in it.  If the complaints aren't political, then the only other thing I could see was if someone just wanted to be ""entertained"".  I don't know if looking at the Sistine Chapel or The Pieta or David or Van Gogh or Da Vinci is ""entertaining"" either. Beautiful, stunning, touching, but not entertaining.  This film was beautiful, stunning, touching.  And Mel Gibson's direction was utterly unbelievable.  I put the direction on par with Orson Welles, or my new favorite, Peter Jackson.  It was....art.This film is what art is about...a true artist with a passion for his art, and then let the public decide.

My question is this--will Mel Gibson nominate actors for Oscars, or will he not want to ""commercialize"" the film.  In other words, does he want the spotlight to be on the actors or the figures they are portraying????  I can see him going both ways, but I think he should allow them to be nominated.  That will allow the film to get even MORE publicity.  But, does it really need more publicity?

803,Matteo-18,Not good,3,3 March 2004,"What has been lost amid all the controversy is that this is not a very good film when you consider just its merits as a film. Despite the violence, the film is incredibly boring. Unless you are a Christian and, therefore, have a vested interest in the story, the director, script, and lead actor give the audience no reason to care about what's going on. And I suspect that if Jim Cavaziel weren't playing Christ, no one would care. This film is benefiting from the fact that a great many Christian Americans are unable to separate how they feel (or believe they are supposed to feel) about Christ and how they feel about the film. Just because you believe in Christ doesn't mean you are required to like this film. Jim Cavaziel has absolutely no charisma on screen. Jesus clearly had charisma. Otherwise, he wouldn't have had so many followers in his lifetime. Additionally, unless you are a Christian or someone who at least knows a bit about the New Testament, nothing is really explained in this movie. Ultimately, Mel Gibson is attempting to preach to the choir. We Christians in the audience don't need to be proselytized to, so the fact that only the converted could understand this film seems odd to me. But not everything about this movie is horrible. For one, it doesn't deserve the controversy it has incited. I have read that this film shows no sympathetic Jewish characters. I find such things odd considering that two of the high priests early in the film denounce the arrest and hearings against Jesus. Furthermore, all the people shown to be lamenting Jesus' fate as he carries his cross were Jews. I do, however, agree that Pilate is inaccurately portrayed. Even if you're going strictly by the Scriptures, Pilate more than anything was afraid of taking responsibility for Jesus' death for fear of a violent reaction from his many followers. I didn't sense any of that coming from Pilate in the film. And as for the violence, only during the scourging did I feel it was gratuitous and overdone, but only somewhat. The extent of Jesus' flogging wounds, however, are portrayed such that you don't believe any person would live through it. It was perhaps too extreme. Ultimately, I don't know what Mel Gibson thought he would achieve with this film. Sure, many people claim to have been moved by the film. I think they were confused. I cried during the film, but that's because what the film was attempting to portray made me think about what Jesus was put through. So I began to cry as a result of my thoughts, not because of what I saw on screen. For such a violent film about a topic that is deeply meaningful to so many of us, this film is incredibly sterile and unfeeling. If someone really wants to get closer to Christ, skip the film, read the Bible, and go to church and pray.",The Passion of the Christ

I think Mel Gibson missed an opportunity here to tell a really good story. Instead, we are treated to torture and violence for the entire film. Yes, I understand that that too is also an important aspect in Jesus' life and death, but COME ON! YUCK! Visually, the movie is powerful in terms of its technical achievements.

The Bible records that He was beaten beyond recognition.  That He didn't even resemble a human being when everyone was done having their hand at Him.  That His beard was pulled out of His face, leaving bloody, gaping craters in His face.  Have you ever had even a small cut on your face?

Even more so than what was shown in this movie...!Something like what is seen in this movie (and what really happened) can't possibly have one single thing to do with religion  with going to a certain place one day a week or twice a year, dressing up, singing a few songs, hearing a lecture and going home, most of us to live however we want to live  can it?  Would YOU die like Jesus did  shredded and slaughtered like some animal in a meat factory and viciously HATED as He was  so people for 2000 years could dress up and ""go to church?""  I don't think so.No, this movie and it's true meaning for our lives is about more than listening to sterilized words one day a week and going home to live however you want to live  this is about blood and murder: GOD slaughtered by men (Jews AND non-Jews).  True Love.  Redemption (because we are so black and sinful and needed what He did so badly).  War. So we can have True Peace. This is about US spitting in God's face (just like in the movie), telling Him we'd rather just do things our way, beating and flogging the very Life out of Him, and sending him to the most cruel death machine ever devised by human beings (eg. the Roman crucifixion process.)Hopefully people will use this movie to WAKE UP and reach out to the God that went through all that was seen in the movie, to redeem us from our sins, buy us back, and allow us to serve Him all the rest of our days in Gratitude for what He has done for us.  Don't for a minute doubt that what you see in this movie really happened and that the ramifications of it are far, far greater than many of us have experienced or can even imagine.",The Passion of the Christ

Mel Gibson deserves many apologies by all those who crucified him for producing and directing such a powerful work of genius.  The movie is by far the most important movie that I have ever seen.  The acting, directing, sound, score, screenplay, editing, cinematography, art direction, visual effects are all outstanding.  This movie should sweep the Academy Awards next year!

812,alan_dana,Gripping Depiction of an Execution,5,1 March 2004,"This film is a shocking and gripping depiction of how the Romans executed people during the height of their empire.  The movie could have been about any one of untold thousands of people who were put through the same sequence of events.This gets to an aspect of this movie that I don't see many people commenting about.  There is very little to the movie that sets apart this particular execution from any of the other thousands upon thousands of similar executions.  You could have picked any of them and made pretty much the same movie.  Especially given that there was no resurrection scene, thus the ending is the death of the accused, just like all of the other executions. I believe this was a good choice by the director, as there is no proof there was a resurrection.The man Jesus was a social and religious revolutionary.  As such he was perhaps a threat to the Jewish leadership, although if one studies period history in depth, this is debatable as they allowed other religious revolutionaries to exist in their society.  However he would have been an even bigger threat to the Romans, who likely had a much larger role than this movie depicted.  Most likely Jesus was executed for being a trouble-maker, who stirred up the people in ways that threatened Roman order.  Thus the claims the movie is anti-Semite have some validity as it overplayed their logical involvement in these events.The value of this movie is that it gives one a glimpse at the horror of brutal government.  These types of brutal executions did not end with the Romans, they continue today all over the world.  The people being executed are oftimes tortured just as much (and sometimes more) and they are not deserving of this fact (who is?).  If this movie can move people to opposing torture and execution in today's world, then it will have done something of true value.",The Passion of the Christ

I'm glad I saw it, though, very glad.I'm still carrying to weight of the implications in my stomach.  I've never seen such a powerful movie, and a movie that is ready to meet SO many people.  Even if one has not been raised in a religious home, one can appreciate the sheer pain that the man Jesus went through.  If you are a Christian, then you'd better be on your knees.  This movie led me to pray for the first time in 2 years.  The cineamatography was amazing, and the film impeccable in its execution.

815,Craven-11,Passionless,5,17 April 2004,"For a film dealing with the death of Jesus Christ's final hours of torture and mutilation, and considering the significant hype that this film was one of the most violent and bloody ever made, I expected to be moved, brought to tears, devastated.  Even considering my non-adherance to religious dogma, I thought that this would be a powerful portrait of one mans suffering and pain.  But, inevitably, the film failed to move me in any way past exclamations of, 'ohhhhhhhh, thats got to hurt', the film essentially being devoid of any real spiritual message (although there are excerpts intercut throughout his torture of his kindness and humanity to try and force a rapore between audience and character to make up for any lack of background that has gone before).  Prolonged and extensive scenes of violence initially shock, then, after being kicked, cut, whipped and so on, desensitisation kicks in.  The score tries hard to stir the emotions, and if it wasn't for a one-note script and premise, it would probably have worked.This dosen't mean I've missed the point: I understand that the film was created to show just how much suffering one man went through, but on the one hand, I find it difficult to swallow the idea that he died for humanity's sins, and that he therefore died for everyone, past and present.  The film, if anything, shows he died becuase he wanted people to believe that he was the son of God, and to sacrifice himself, in true martyr fashion, in the name of what he believed: and it just shows how ignorant and bloodthirsty the Romans were.The film at least gave the Christian Churchs an advertising tool for their religion.  I got free entrance to see the film and a free lecture at the end of it about reaching out to God and how we are all full of sin.  An unfortunately empty and uninvolving film, using tactics from a horror movie to sell a dying religion, you get the feeling that they're flaying a dead carcass (no pun).  I don't want to generalise, but I feel that it will be mostly those already of the Christian faith who find it a rewarding and humbling experience, for they are the ones familiar with his history.  I don't think seeing someone getting tortured for a couple of hours constitutes a religous experience.",The Passion of the Christ
816,jpanettiere,Elucidating,10,11 March 2004,"For all of the common opinions of the film, I disagreed with many of them. Anti-semitic?  No, unless you find attacks on the Pharisees as anti-semitic, I suppose if you're an Orthodox Jew you would.  Excessively brutal?  Well, there was a lot of brutality, but as it is historically accurate it was appropriate - nobody complained that ""Schindler's List"" was too brutal! Brilliant directing?  Well, I have to disagree with this as well, the movie was shot on a small budget and I think it shows.I found the story, apocryphal or not, to be quite fascinating.  What you really learn in watching this movie is how Christ's philosophy transformed the world.  While some describe the movie itself as ""brutal"", I think it's more accurate to say that the people living in those times were mean and hateful.  In this movie you saw how much abject contempt people held for their fellow man, and often for rather superficial reasons.  The Roman persecutors relentlessly whipped and mocked Jesus, and they didn't even know him.  Their base hatred is at odds with Jesus' message of love and forgiveness, his warning that nobody is free of sin or worthy of judging his fellow man.  When you contrast the treatment he (and others) endured in his time, against the trend towards decency that his teachings engendered, you really appreciate who he was and what he achieved - regardless of your religious view of him.",The Passion of the Christ

The common factor is that all the people who feel this way are all religious. So I feel they are a little bit biased.This movie is not a moving experience, and it's certainly not the greatest film ever. What it really is, is an anti-Semitic film depicting a guy getting the crap beat out of him for two hours, and Gibson trying to see just how much blood and gore he can fit into a movie while still avoiding an NC-17 rating.I have a friend who is very religious, and she gave me a free ticket to see this movie with her and her church group. During the movie, everyone in the theater was crying their eyes out -- except me. Afterwards, everyone talked about how amazing it was. I just smiled and nodded, not wanting to start any arguments, but in my head I kept thinking, ""is this the first movie you people have ever seen?""

819,tytunes,LIKE BEING THERE,10,29 February 2004,"Mel Gibson has made a movie that takes us back in time, and allows us to witness, the suffering of Jesus, as it probably occurred.  Not only is this conveyed through images, but also via the use of the tongues at the time. It was like being there!  One thing that was unexpectedly precious to me, was hearing the name, Jesus, as our Lord heard it spoken to Him back then .. . ""Yea-shoo-ah.""  Gibson's vision is faithful (for the most part) to the Gospels, and helps us to FEEL SOMETHING about what Jesus did for the entire human race.  It does more than this . . . but if it did ONLY THAT, I would count it a tremendous success.  Most of us learned about Jesus and His death in our childhood.  Most of us have ""known"" about it all of our lives, without feeling even one tiny emotion about it.

I must say if you didn't feel like crying, or did cry even during this though, you are pretty tough. This movie seemed to get sadder as Yeshua gets closer to doing what no magician or famous world leader has ever done or ever will. No Other G-d prayed to around the world can pull of that, you just have to believe, and it seems, the film based on his crucifixion left little of his resurrection to be told. I was hoping the film would show a little bit more than him just rising in a split second after his death, and maybe walk around and talk to some of the 500 people who seen him, after he rose, but it didn't. This movie was great from beginning to end, and like all things when you are sad you hopefully try looking for things to keep from crying , like the stepping on the snake and triumphant quotes and bits, but they are seldom seen or heard in this movie. Good movie, though it still , like most belief systems, is focusing on the wrong parts of Yeshua's purpose, and forgetting that he is alive now!

821,microoli,So-So,5,7 March 2004,"When first hearing of this movie, I was skeptical. However, with a little advertisement and the high praises from friends, I decided to give it a go. The result was definately not what I expected it to be. I thought I would be able to stomach any kind of violence thrown at me. I was incredibly wrong.
This movie chronicles the last few days of Christ. From his capture, to the very end, we are spared no gory details. There are some flashbacks, and a few odd scenes with the devil, but really, it is very focused.
Whether or not you are religious, I don't know how much this movie will affect you. For me, it didn't do very much. I was weeping at one point, but only because of how violent the whole thing was. Whip upon whip upon whip. The pace was agravated not only by the repetition of violence, but by director Mel Gibson's decision to not be stingy with slow motion.
The shock value was incredible. Many, many, many tears were shed in the movie theater I went to. Women and men alike could not stop themselves. If you think you can stomach an outrageous amount of gore, it might be worth seeing once, if you are truly curious and brave. Although there might not be many ways to spoil a movie with such an obvious and well-known ending, there are some surprises thrown in too.

Actually, all the human actors were so well (and so unknown) one could forget very easily that they were actors at all.The movie is called The Passion of the Christ and this is a justification for the way it displays Jesus; but one could argue that this is no topic for a movie. It lacks contents and thus is rather boring.Mel Gibson falls into several clichés which even may be ""correct"", historically or religiously seen, but which are clichés nevertheless and thus can be boring.The main plus point for this movie is the emotionality he manages to display. One can feel the pain of Jesus as well as the pain of the two Marys or his followers. This one plus point makes it a watchable movie and lets me give it a 7.",The Passion of the Christ
823,virtualcomputer,One of Bloodiest Murders on Screen,3,28 August 2009,"This comment is somewhat original, in that I am not at all interested in making a religious comment. I am commenting on a Movie as a Movie Fan.First off, the rating that I have given, while low is not intended as an indictment against any religious message, nor am I inclined to be hyperbolic in rating it as a 1, which I clearly don't think it deserves.If I was only interested in rating a movie based on special effects and cinematography, this would sure get a 9 or 10 rating, just as I would give movies like Transformers or Godzilla, both of which I think deserve roughly the same rating, which leads me to consider that the 3 rating might be a little on the high level.This movie is a well produced, visually stunning two hour snuff film.As a movie fan, I don't get this film at all. The movie is not even a foreign language film, it is a dead language film. No matter what country or background You are, You HAVE to have subtitles. But that is OK, there are lots of foreign language films where I have had to read subtitles that I have enjoyed, this isn't one though.Within this film, I don't at all understand why this man is being tortured to death. Why is nearly everyone so mad at this man? What has he done? Why are there so few people on his side? If there are so few people on his side, why should we care? To one degree, I think back to 2001: A Space Odyssey; This film, while visually stunning (for its time) is incredibly difficult to follow without the context of having read the book first. However, there is enough in 2001 to provide a thin thread of context that You can at least try and follow along. And for this reason, I think it fair to say that 2001 has never really been considered a great film.A great film should allow You to walk in without any a priori knowledge and follow along and fully appreciate the story and presentation. Passion definitely fails on this account.This is a bloody violent film with virtually no narrative, no character development and ironically, no passion. I don't have any connection with any of the characters, because in this Movie -- I don't know who any of these characters are or why I should care and I don't know what the story is even supposed to be.Did I walk out of this film with a changed life?

827,edmontdantes,"Jesus is as he was, everything else is skewed",4,27 February 2004,"Mel Gibson's new film the Passion of the Christ has many positive points such as the costumes (which are excellent), the cinematography, and the acting. The decision to make the movie in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew only adds on to the flick instead of making it burdensome. But despite this plethora of positive accomplishments, the narrative and the violence makes it a difficult, and in my opinion, insulting movie to watch. The beating that Christ takes is unbelievably brutal and is only magnitized by the fact that it's being inflicted on one, not very big, man. Besides the infamous whipping scene and crucifiction there is constant sucker punches, slaps, spit in the face, etc. To a devout catholic or christian who sincerely believes that this man took such a beating to redeem the sins of humanity this may be inspirational, touching, and even uplifting. But I only felt pity and disgust as this human being is savagely beaten. The violence aside, my main problem with the movie, however, is the anti-semitism. People can argue either way but let me tell you; I walked into this movie a huge Mel Gibson fan and a firm believer that this movie will not be anti-semetic and walked out feeling insulted and vowing never to give Mel Gibson a penny of my money. First of all there are the crowds composed of Jewish women and children yelling to have Jesus crucified. It seems that everyone not only wants him dead, but also tortured. Second are the priests, the Cohanim, who are portrayed as cowardly, coniving, slippery snakes with bad teeth who hate Jesus because he is the polar opposite of them. The greater political situation of the time is not expressed and we never get a well-rounded side of the Cohanim. In other words it's good guy Jesus vs. Bad guy the Jews. But what really gets me is the depiction of Pontius Pilate. We know from other historical writing such as Josephus Flavious's ""Jewish Antiquities"" that Pilate was a monster, a brutal murder who crucified thousands in an attempt to suppress jewish uprisings. I know that the gospels paint a different picture of him but Mel Gibson takes it to an extreme. Apparantly Pilate is sleeping with a follower of Jesus (Claudia), something never mention in the Gospels, and is a philosopher in search for truth - ""veritas"". When the Jews mention that they want Jesus crucified he gasps as if it is the most harsh penalty ever made whereas in reality we know that Pilate crucified thousands of men every day and crucifying another false Messiah would hadly cause him to lose sleep. Basically, the reforms of Vatian II are completely ignored and the Romans are exculpated of all guilt and instead it is shifted unto the Jews. If you want a good depiction of Pontius Pilate read Bulgakov's ""Master and Margarita"". If you want a good story of Jesus watch Scorcece's ""the last temptation of Christ"". If you want a good portrayal of Jesus as a person but an ignorant portrayal of the gospels watch ""The last temptation of Christ"".",The Passion of the Christ
828,bryedtan_02,Know the story but still good to watch it again.Warning Spoilers appear in review.,10,23 April 2004,"Mel Gibson's latest directed film is terrific and I have to say a masterpiece. Greatly realistic and loved the direction, acting, and even the sets of this film. This is possible the best film made on the subject of the crucifying of the founder of the Christian faith. From the start to the end it still keeps your attention despite the fact it is already known to most people of what will occur. Even from seeing Jesus' arrest to his death and as we know resurrection it is still a great drama. His arrest by guards ( gives new meaning to the word police brutality)to his trial which is one sided is realistically portrayed and masterfully performed. Accusations lately are abound that the film has been accused of being Anti-Semite I say no it is not the film makers provided a number of reasons for one in the scene as the Jewish councils condemned Jesus two Jewish rabbi's calls the proceeding as A travesty and questions why only few members of the council are present thus the council instead of including more moderate and reasonable members are not present to ensure a guilty response. But the more moderate Jewish leaders are removed thus their cries that the proceedings is unjust are not heard. In fact the mob that cries for Christ to be persecuted is in truth not even the majority of the Jewish population but the noisy minority. Ironically every time I see the Jewish High Priest Caiphas instead I am reminded of radical Shite Cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr in Iraq. Who leads a minority sect but because of the loud noise and yelling they do they get all the attention and soon the more moderate majority are left out. It is understandable that Jewish groups are concerned as we speak certain Islamic leaders who are blatantly Anti-Semite are using the old Nazi excuse to allow Jews to be discriminated. This is not only wrong it is not the message of the film. Jews did not crucify but his political enemies did but a small minority soon lets the silent majority take the blame. Now I don't know why but I know Christ in my view was not murdered by Jews but his political opponents. I don't know why in the Middle East the notion of Jew hating remains in that region maybe it is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or it is because hate still thrives in the region. Secondly I could not help noticed but in every aspect Christ seems to know of this painful road he is to take and he still takes it not just the physical pain but even the sense of being betrayed by Judas, some of his own people, and even political betrayal by Pilate. No matter what I believed Christ knew and gladly accepted the punishment in order to show a more new form of thought and allow the ideals of forgiveness and tolerance to be spread. The film is so far the most realistic in the subject of Christ's death unlike the more tamer ones in previous films but I was not shocked as some people say it may be too brutal maybe I'm desensitized by years of watching films and television.This is a recommended view for movie lovers. My rating *****=excellent film.",The Passion of the Christ

The Passion Of The Christ, however, presents an unrelenting two hours (or so) of torture. I would equate it with the rape scene from Irreversible - it was at time very hard to watch. As a reilgious message, I have no doubt that this movie could be regarded as accurate. As a movie I find it mediocre. The acting is tepid, the story is slow - it really never sucked me in as a good movie should, it actually felt like an educational movie where the point was the information, not the entertainment value or artistic merit. Redeeming features are few and far between, some of the flashbacks like when jesus was a carpenter and was playing with Mary were good, and showed perhaps a better movie that could have been made that didn't focus solely on a man being beaten to death.",The Passion of the Christ
830,jp71ph,Powerful and Intense,9,3 April 2004,"The Passion of the ChristThe Passion of the Christ may well be the most controversial film to hit the screens in several years and many `experts' have predicted its doom, but as opposed to the estimates and predictions of the `experts' and `critics', it has become the number one film of 2004. After watching it, I left the theater dumbstruck and `in awe'. Having watched the film 3 times now, I still find the film too powerful and controversial to effectively critique it or even to review it. So I'll just react or give my comment on it.I am proud to be Christian. I am proud to be a Catholic and I can proudly say that `The Passion of the Christ' is the best Film in years in terms of its emotional intensity, graphic portrayal, values, morals and its artistic ingenuity.I am a Filipino and I live in the only Christian nation in Asia, the Philippines. It was only recently that the film `The Passion of the Christ' hit our theaters but I deem that it was the right time for we are nearing the observance of the Holy Week. It was not a surprise that people warmly accepted the film for it opened many eyes and hearts with regards to Christ and what he had to endure to save us from sin. Bravo Mel and Jim!I am wondering why most Americans (especially the `critics') and other nations see this film as `too violent'. They rate it `restricted' or for `16 or 18 years old and above'. Do you know that the classification board in my country rated it PG-13? Imagine, it is not even Restricted - 13, but only PG-13! Our classifications board thought that the graphic portrayal is an important/essential part of the story and therefore should not be restricted or even cut. The film was even endorsed by the local Church authorities (as expected) as `for everyone'. The people at the Vatican were right: `It is as it was.'For those who have not yet seen the film, please find time to go out and watch it. For a change, watch this movie beyond its technicality and its `physical' characteristics as a film. Feel it. Absorb it. Reflect on it and you will see and realize many things. This is one of the rare types of films that effectively captured both my mind and my heart for its intensity, influence and power.Words will never be effective in conveying my thoughts and emotions with regards to this film. The only thing I can say is this: In the end as you go out of the theater shocked, awe-inspired and teary-eyed, try to live by the things that you learn and grasp from the movie. And as Jesus has preached, `You must love one another.'",The Passion of the Christ
831,MixedNutsProductions,The most moving film about Christ ever,10,14 March 2004,"When viewing this film, I was in shock, but not in a negative manner, but because I felt so moved by this it that I wanted to repent every sin I have ever committed.This incredibly powerful film is blew me away.  Never before have I ever cried so much during a film.  Not even Schindler's List got to me that much. Is this film violent?  Yes, extremely.  But that's the point.Many critisize this film for being too gratuitously violent...I've even read a review that accuses it of being pornographic to violence.  Many critisisms say that the film doesn't show any of Christ's teachings or life.  Well, The Passion is just what the film was, the suffering and death of Christ.  The Passion is the part of the Gospels (The Stations of the Cross) that deals solely and ONLY with the crucifixion of Christ, not with his teachings.
What Gibson tried to do with this film was to portray and stress the point that Christ indeed suffered horribly for our sins to save mankind.  When you read it in the Bible (which for the most part, this film is almost dead accurate), it comes across lightly.  We take for granted when it says that someone Jesus was scourged, that he was struck repeatidly on the head, that he was indeed nailed to the cross, that he was whipped repeatidly and fell 3 times while marching towards Golgotha, etc.  We read it and just overlook it.  We don't realize what Christ went through.Now, others will say that there is no way Christ would have survived this, blah blah blah.  Please remember that crucifixion, with the torture, was meant to last for 2-4 days.  Christ lasted a grand total of 3 hours. Also, Christ told Pilate himself that no man had any power over him, that the only power is given by his Father, the Almighty God.  Christ was meant to give up his soul when he was ready to give it up, and no man could kill him.  He did it on his own when he was on the cross, right before the earth quaked and the bodies of the dead rose from their graves.Some also slightly critisize Pilate as being too sympathetic.  Read your Bible, Pilate didn't want to crucify Christ.  He wasn't calling for the blood of him....He was reluctant and washed his hands of it.  He was a ruthless man, but he didn't try to provoke the crucifixion of Christ.  He tried to avoid it.Back then also, were people crucified by having their wrists nailed instead of their palms.  Yes, that is true, but the Gospels, Christian doctrines and traditions have always represented Christ as having the wounds in his hands, not his wrists.  Gibson made this choice based on what we have always seen in crucfixes that tens of thousands of Catholics wear around their necks, myself included.The biggest critisism of this film is that it is anti-semetic, which is a load of bullplop to begin with.  To say this film is anti-semetic towards Jews is like saying Schindler's List is anti-ethnic against all Germans....that every single German is evil and responsible for the murder of 6 million Jews.  The Jews that showed up at Christ's trial were along with Caiphous in callling for the crucifixion of Christ, who Caiphous had the crowd bribed by propoganda to begin with.  Do we forget about the hundreds of other Jews who cried for Christ's life....who tried to help him....Who were there along the roads feeling Christ's pain?  Do we also forget that Christ Himself was Jewish?With the controversy asside, the film itself, outside the context of the incredible story of all ages and the great talent used to portray these legendary characters, is a technical marvel.  The cinematography combined with the music is so moving that just watching this aspect can bring tears to your eyes.If you wanted to compare this to Martin Scorcese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" this film wins by a long shot.  This was approached with much more class, attention to detail, and will to tell the story of Christ in a serious manner, not with Harvey Keital horribly portrayed Judas and everyone in Judea with a New York accent.I highly recommend this film and ask for you to go into it knowing the truth about how things are.  Think about what The Passion really was, not what the Life of Christ was or historical fact.  This film was based on the Gospels and the Stations of the Cross, not what some historians with too much time on their hands think.",The Passion of the Christ
832,spruance-1,"A detailed, excruciating retelling of the last days of Christ",10,6 September 2004,"The film depicts the horrific treatment of Jesus by all those who had a hand in his death. None of them comes off well, although the details, generally, have been known for two millenia. The petty jealousies of the Jewish rabbinate and the practiced callousness and brutality of the Roman Governor and troops provide well-defined counterpoints to Jesus's somewhat unorthodox, for the time, message of peace and brotherhood. The furor which preceded the film's release and the unfounded fears of a tidal wave of anti-semitism were clearly based on lack of knowledge of the film and knee-jerk reaction. The film could well have been described as viciously anti-Roman, as well. All in all, a finely crafted film that makes the 2,000 year old story of Jesus come alive.",The Passion of the Christ

In the end however it was an intriguing and interesting view into the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. The acting was amazing and the cinematography was excellent. My only complaint about the whole thing was that it was so graphic, that at some point i just couldn't watch. It was above and beyond making a point, in fact the crucifixion was a relief. Not suitable for children under 13 at all. Worth seeing, makes great discussion material.",The Passion of the Christ
834,dividebyzero,Terrible.,1,27 February 2004,"Terrible.Where to start..Ok. It's a fair interpretation of the last days of Jesus' life as according to the gospels. But it is so poorly carried out as to be insulting to the intelligence of the average movie goer. For example, for some reason they decided to spell symbolism in bold capital letters. It wasn't symbolism so much as S*Y*M*B*O*L*I*S*M. Every time something symbolic would happen, the camera would zoom in and everything would go slow motion. This happened about every 45 seconds. Had the movie not used slow motion, it would have been about 55 minutes long. Bad symbolism ensures that an audience remains totally disconnected from a movie. The music changed exactly as the story did, something that should only be reserved for pulp movies.Satan was pretty cool. Unfortunately he/she was not given a context; you didn't really know why he/she was in those chosen scenes. Oh yeah..Gibson also decided to use deformed children and deformed babies to represent Satan's demons. Somewhat distasteful, and it was a pretty good example of S*Y*M*B*O*L*I*S*M that this movie tries to hit you with.This movie had an unprecedented level of violence. I'm a horror fan and I've never actually seen a close up slow motion view of skin, blood, veins, muscle and fat being torn from a man's ribcage with a razor blade tipped whip. Until now. Basically, the movie is 2 hours of Jesus bleeding. Gorehounds would love this movie. It almost made me sick. It was sad to see that violence was the only way emotion was brought into the story. There was potential for much more. Maybe some acting would have helped?  Or some decent dialogue?Absolutely no context for the characters. Jesus is portrayed as a weepy pawn. Mary is portrayed as a helpless doting mother. The disciples are barely present and don't do much of anything. Judas was nothing but a backstabber.. they barely made him human (according to the Bible, he was the catalyst for the sacrifice; had he not done what he did, Jesus would have not been crucified and would not have been able to avert the apocalypse). The only character with any depth was Pontious Pilate.
The movie's format was problematic. Basically it tries to be a 'flashback' movie. You know, where the main story occasionally stops to explain something that happened in the character's past. But this movie does it so badly you end up confused. They're done at random and mostly have nothing to do with his current state of affairs. And unless you have a good understanding of the gospels you're lost in the flashbacks; they don't make it clear who he's talking to; what he's doing; or why he's doing it. 
For example, there's a Mary Magdalene flashback that has only three short cuts: Jesus drawing a line in the sand, a bunch of rocks being thrown onto the ground, and a hand reaching for Jesus' foot. Ms. Magdalene was barely present in the movie, though I suppose the same could be said for the Bible. There's a short flashback with Lazerus' sister.... Amarian? (not sure if that's her name) that was presented with no backstory whatsoever.  The random flashbacks looked like they were added in after the rest of the movie was done, and didn't help anything.  There are a few completely ridiculous aspects of the movie. 
King Herod: Remember ""Jesus Christ Superstar""? It's the same character. Exactly. He's a dirty, fat yippie. I waited for him to break out in song, yet I was disappointed.Jesus's genitals: NOT PRESENT. I was astonished to see that he was not completely naked during crucifixion. I don't know what the MPAA was thinking.  They showed him being beaten, whipped, stabbed, flogged, spiked and pierced, yet the didn't remove his loincloth prior to crucifixion!
Roman soldiers: The romans weren't known for tickling their prisoners to death, but they were known as a well trained and disciplined army. Every Roman except for Pilate and his wife Claudia (who were made out to be completely innocent and guilt ridden) were made out to be insubordinate drunken lunatics. Anyways.. I had to see this movie. I was raised Catholic and educated in Catholic schools.  My girlfriend is Anglican and we're both interested in all aspects of religion. I was curious to see how a modern interpretation of religious events would be carried visually. We were both let down in a big way. ""Passion of The Christ"" is only the story of a man bleeding to death. Nothing is explored, nothing is developed, nothing is explained, no message is present in the story.",The Passion of the Christ
835,gpurin,One of the best Gore movies ever (there may be some spoilers ahead),7,2 April 2004,"Before I´ve ever saw this movie I thought that all those critics about it being anti semite, where unfounded. When I saw the movie my thoughts where write, the movie has no anti semite motivation, and It´s true to the scripts, but also my fears where confirmed. In and effort to attract more viewers to the cinemas, Gibson have comited an abuse of blood and suffering in this movie.That amount of blood, make people miss the main message, that is ""he died for our sins"" and delivers a complete different one ""We are such bas... animals"".Technically speaking, the movie have a fine direction, the photography, directions and wardrobe are excellent, but the performances are poor, all the characters are undimentional, and the only thing we see for about one hour and a half of the movie are hits and leashes.In my opinion, ""The last temptation"" is a far more better movie that this one, since the acting, and story are more complex and well delivered. The only good point about the Passion, is the new point of view of the passion, from Maria´s point of view as mother of Jesus (the man not the God) and her impotence and sorrow of her been unable to help his son, is really a shame that that new perspective only deserved about 10 minutes of the hole movie, it will be nice if someone pick up the challenge, and make a new movie about Maria, and her feelings for her kid.As and overall, this is not a must to see movie, the history you all know it, so if you haven´t seen it, just wait until it airs on cable (unless you are a gore fan, and love to see blood in the big screen, if that is your kind of movie, well maybe you will give this movie 10 out of 10), I give this movie 6 and a half from 10, and this only for the technical aspects of the movie.",The Passion of the Christ

All this controversy about how the film sould be banned and all it's anti-semitism is just untrue. If jews dont like it, its there business. it's only a film, for Gods sake. It will not be the end of Mel Gibson's career. It will give it an even bigger boost.

837,alisondennehy,"Oh dear, not another god squadder...",1,26 February 2004,"The only difference between this and the idea of any other religious delusional is that Mel had some money to throw at the ""I'm right and everybody else is the hell-bound spawn of satan"" rant.Clearly, Mr Gibson has lost the plot - in real life - entirely.  It is a genuine shame that someone who was such a good actor and who earned so much money at the top of his game, should become so desperate and needy that he feels that the crutch of various fairy tales some wandering nomads made up thousands of years ago is preferable to facing reality.Here in Aus we are very grateful, all of a sudden, that Mel has so strongly associated himself with America in the last decade.  Frankly, we now find him an embarassment and are happy to say ""he's all yours guys!""
The film's merits, in the sense of directors, actors etc. are really not that important.  Those who are already very bored with this sort of nonsense will call a delusion a delusion and stay away in droves - rather than lining the pockets of the latest Koresh substitute.Those who find this sort of stuff scintillating are welcome to it.

838,alisondennehy,Poor Soul,1,1 May 2004,"Mel Gibson was so depressed before he made this movie that he felt it ""healed"" him to make it. The making of the movie was obviously related to his own mental problems.  What a shame that some  people have chosen to reinforce his issues with their own issues. A person's religious beliefs are their own.  The main difference between Mel and other fanatics is that he had the money to back up the ""we're right and the rest of of you are all going to the fiery pit rant"" with some cash. 
The other difference is that if he had not been so rich and powerful before he started this project, those who cared about him might have tried to stop him and help him, rather than encouraging him.  Money talks, I suppose even if it means ignoring another persons mental problems.RegardsRegards",The Passion of the Christ
839,ajeremy_3_33,"However you look at it, Mel Gibson has created a film that is grotesquely violent, powerfully moving and it is my greatest hope, not too constrained.",10,2 March 2004,"The Passion of the Christ
I would first like to say that I consider it a deep privilege to be at this institution writing this column and reviewing this film.  The Passion of the Christ may well be one of the most important films of all time to directly deal with the Christian faith.  That said, I feel really weird about judging a movie that is based on the life of a man who ardently spoke out against being judgmental.  My hope is that this review will be as objective and fair as is possible coming from my worldview.  From a technical standpoint, this film is nearly perfect.  The lighting, cinematography, sound and editing were as close to flawless as I have ever seen.  Gibson pulled together an all-star crew that accounted for 14 past Oscar nominations and four wins (including Gibsons' for Best Director and picture on Braveheart).  This level of skill and experience has been one of the main elements missing from religious films of the last half-century.
The technical achievements of this film would mean nothing without great acting, and there was plenty of it.  My praise can in no way begin to do the performances justice.  Jim Caveziel carries the film on his back with his extremely passionate portrait of Jesus, not to mention stand out performances from Monica Bellucci (Mary Magdalene), Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate), and what may well have been the best performance of the film, Maia Morgenstern as Mary.   The Passion carries a very big emotional punch, but for me tears came not as much from the violence, but from the films flashbacks to earlier events from the life of Jesus.  They balance the tension created from the brutal violence, but more importantly they expose the humanity of Christ and of those who loved him.  The flashbacks are moving and for the most part tremendously poetic.As much as I would like to end my review here and slap an A+ at the end and call it a day, I cannot. It would not be fair to you as a reader or honest of me.  The film has one major flaw.  It assumes the viewer has pre-existing knowledge of the life of Christ, and I feel that without this knowledge there is a potential to just gross out viewers and send them on their way. One thing past adaptations have done right is create a more fully developed character of Jesus.  The Passion instead opted to go straight into crucifixion.  With a rather low run time of only two hours (considering it is a historical epic) I would have liked to see a little more development of the character of Jesus and possibly more of an explanation of why the Sanhedrin wanted him dead.As a Christian, this was a very powerful moving film.  I was witnessing my very salvation, the sacrifice that I believe will keep me from spending eternity in hell, worked out in a more compelling way that I have ever seen. This may have been Mel Gibson's main purpose. Maybe he was not concerned with reaching out, but reminding believers.  However you look at it, he has created a film that is grotesquely violent, powerfully moving and it is my greatest hope, not too constrained. Overall Grade: A",The Passion of the Christ
840,mike-arredondo,To see or not to see...,10,25 February 2004,"My agnostic friend wants to see the film, but refuses to see the film without me. My wife agreed to let our almost 9 year old son see it, but not until Friday night because she wants him to be home with us should he have any questions the next day. My atheist co-worker is very curious about it but claims that it's not his ""cup o tea.""Despite the fact that I have plenty of responsibilities, I have not been able to think about much else in the weeks leading up to the movie. Now that I've finally seen the film, I feel relieved. Blessed. Moved. Encouraged. I called all of my loved ones and encouraged them to see it. To ""witness"" it. I cried. And if you are not afraid to cry, you will too. It was both brutal and at the same time, beautiful. Artistic and yet, horrible.

841,mike-arredondo,"Brutal, yet beautiful",10,23 March 2004,"If you do not believe the truth, then you definitely will not appreciate ""The Passion of the Christ"". If you believe, then you will adore and embrace this work of cinematic art. During the film you more than likely will feel: nervousness, uneasiness, amazement, distress, empathy, conviction, frustration, compassion, sorrow, empathy, adoration, admiration, devotion, triumph, and peace.For those in between, I encourage you to see the film with an open heart. If you only see it with your eyes open and not your ""heart"", you will not be able to completely ""feel"" and ""know"" the message delivered from Gibson's perspective.IMO, this is not a movie, nor a documentary but a ""story"", told in a very special way. If you allow yourself to be engrossed in other films but feel guarded going into this one, you may be missing something important. I'd encourage you to set aside your preconceived notions, theology, religion, myths, etc.. and just go with the attitude of a ""witness"". You're about to witness something incredible. Gibson, puts you in a position to be a virtual ""eye-witness"" to Jesus Christ's last 12 hours on Earth and experience Easter in its true form.Your attitude going in will make all the difference. Additionally, if you are afraid to cry, or go to the theatre with people you don't feel completely comfortable with, you may feel awkward or may ""holdback"". I'd encourage you to see it once in solitude, and then, if you feel like seeing it again later, you may be able to see it with a more discerning and contemplative way.Bottom line, the film was brilliant and moving. It's about 90% biblically accurate, with Gibson taking small bits of poetic license here and there while keeping the true essence of the scriptural story. I will not give away which portions were not accurate for fear that it may take away from your experience. However, the message of sacrifice, perseverance and love abound in this beautifully told story and if you allow it, will stir in you a renewed feeling of purpose and drive to know Him more.-M.A.",The Passion of the Christ

But I don't agree with the idea that we should not make movies which might upset a certain group of people even though the movie is based on stories regarded as facts by the majority of the world population.

Gibson gave us a clear picture of what happened 2000 years ago at that time. we need to have clear visions to understand.what Gibson should have done is to spend a little bit more on this movie because certain scenes seem a bit fake ... as in ... there are certain scenes which seems small level not big screen level. here i'm talking about the buildings and temples that were present in the movie. anyway ... the rest was immaculate! this is a must see movie. its not just for those who believe in Christ but to everybody. i think this movie should win an academy award for best director (gibson), make-up and actor (caviezel). it deserves it!",The Passion of the Christ

847,niniel_nienory,a film made with passion,10,11 September 2004,"From animated TV series to grand epic productions like Franco Zefirelli's movie,there have been innumerable attempts to put the story of Jesus Christ's life,death and resurrection to screen.Most directors failed to touch the hearts of the viewers or involve them emotionally and spiritually in the Passion of the Christ.But where they failed Mel Gibson succeeded.With his brilliant directing and ingenious new vision of the way the story should be filmed he created a movie that is more than just another interpretation of the Bible.The Passion of the Christ is a soul-purifying experience to all. With this latest film Mel Gibson has once again proved his quality as a director.He was first generally acclaimed for his brilliant work on Brave Heart but he did not until now reveal his full potential as a movie-maker.Every scene has a great visual impact over the viewer.Every little detail is driven to pure perfection.Slow motion was used with utmost precision only where necessary in order to have the greatest possible influence on the viewer's heart and soul.A drop of blood,the first raindrop after Christ's death,the dry sand slipping though Mother Mary's fingers - these are all images forever imprinted in our minds.Mel Gibson not only created a visually perfect masterpiece but also dared to do what was thought impossible - he brought a dead language back to life.Many accused him at first of making a film that will be incomprehensible to the audience/please note that he intended not to use subtitles/.Still for the first time in movie history we have the chance to hear the words that changed the entire course of our history pronounced exactly as they were some two thousand years ago. Besides,in making the casting for the film Mel Gibson did not count on Hollywood celebrities,thus allowing the viewer to focus on the characters rather than on the actors themselves.I hope I will be forgiven mentioning it,but as I am a Bulgarian,I cannot help but feel proud that two Bulgarian actors akso took part in the production /Pilat and apostle John/. Mel Gibson was also criticised for the violence,even brutality i the film.At first I was also scared by what was said to be an extremely violent movie but than I realized that this is the only way a film about Christ should be made.Brutality was exactly what was missing in the other interpretations of Jesus's crucifixion,exactly what made this particular movie so influential.The power of the Passion of the Christ is in the idea that Love can endure any Suffering,can Sacrifice even ,thus leading to Salvation. The Passion of the Christ is not just another movie,it is a personal experience,our own Golgota.For me the film had the same soul-purifying effect as going to church,for example.Looking at the faces of those going out of the cinema I realized that each one of them had undergone a certain change of character.It's because the movie is not only about passion,it is a movie made with passion,a passion that leaves no one indifferent.",The Passion of the Christ

It also teaches the true meaning of Jesus' Passion and what He did for us. The gore during His scourging and Crucixifiction opened my heart towards Christ, and made the film more realistic. This was good because it truly shows how different things were done back then. It also gave me a better understanding about Christ's death. The people who label this film as anti Semitic don't know what they're talking about. The Jews handed Him over to the Romans to be crucified. Read your Bibles. The Romans never wanted to murder Christ. Pilate saw no wrong in Him. He was peer pressured by the Sanhedrin to do it so that it wouldn't attract the attention of Tiberius Caesar. Judea was a pit that couldn't afford another rebellion. Caesar would've had Pilate killed if he did not give the Jews what they wanted. This does not make Pontius Pilate a good person at all. Pilate knew he was a murderer. Most importantly, Jesus' death and Resurrection had to be fulfilled. If you watch any of the other Jesus films, you will notice that the Sanhedrin put Jesus on trial, and persuaded Pilate to have Him killed.The music was excellent.

850,cooperaitaliano,Deeply Moving and excellently filmed,9,28 December 2006,"This movie was clearly set to be highly controversial right from the start and I can fully understand why. However I went to watch it at the cinema and then saw it on DVD more recently. It is extremely well done and adheres to the Gospels, covering the crucifixion of Christ.I am familiar with the details of what Jesus went through, along with reading from a medical perspective, the injuries that were inflicted upon Him when He was beaten and finally crucified. It is beyond comprehension to even imagine, let alone view in film, particular where other older films have given a more sanitised view. It is certainly not easy to watch, but it challenges each person who watches it. It is unlikely that anyone can be indifferent about the Passion after they have seen it.The Devil portrayed as a female character, the demonic children, the rain drop from heaven. These were interesting elements that certainly are not shown in the Gospels, but they do not detract from the film's main purpose.It was very brave of Mel Gibson to make such a film and certainly he has come in for enormous criticism as a result of such a film. Much has been made of the supposed anti semitism and the level of violence. Others have already responded adequately here to such criticisms and I do not think it is necessary for me to repeat them. Personally, I am glad such a film was made and shown. Its subject, quality and integrity speak clearly enough. The most important thing is that it challenges people, forcing them to make a decision concerning what they believe and in what they put their faith.A very good and challenging film.",The Passion of the Christ

And story as some holes... so you stop the film and forget to look for the next part... and you don't even need or want to go further. The big thing inside this film, for me, is the torture scene that I find quite interesting in many ways : casting of roman soldiers, framing, space for this butchery, so one. It is and stands as an unique moment in cinema. It is many things : ""torture-porn"" as some one says here, flesh, blood, metal mixing together.

852,mightybadguy,"I was blown away, best picture from 2000 on for sure.",10,27 December 2017,"I must conclude that the 7.2 rating for this movie as i am writing this is mostly due to people upset with Mel Gibson himself. The film as far as films go is a masterpiece. Truly amazing! That is saying a lot since I think most films of the past 20 years are awful. The budget for this picture was 30 million and it earned 620-700 million just in box office sales. There is a reason for that, the movie is great. If you are not religiously bound or simply anti-Gibson then you are in for a treat. 10+ stars!!",The Passion of the Christ
853,bneathanaprlmoon,"Great film, unfairly maligned",8,1 January 2016,"Passion of the Christ sets a go-to example of historical/mytho- historical filmmaking done right. I'd stop short of saying it's the gold standard for the genre, but it's definitely a 'silver standard'.It seems a lot of the film's detractors are either projecting their personal feelings about Mel Gibson, or are simply the sorts of angsty teenage atheists who loathe anything religious on a purely emotional level (I'm totally irreligious myself, but as a scholar of the art of late antiquity I obviously have to be able to appreciate religious- inspired works from an objective standpoint). Then there are those who claim they hated it for being 'too violent', which is rubbish. Life on the frontiers of the Roman world WAS violent, and crucifixion was among the most horrific means of execution ever devised, so being violent is a matter of historical accuracy. But moreover, this is simply not a criticism that such people level toward other works. Certainly squeamish church ladies (and their left wing counterparts, SJWs who think PTSD from internet comments is a thing) would be in character making such a critique, but this seems to be coming overwhelmingly from the same kinds of younger, 'edgier' sorts who love movies like Kill Bill and Sin City precisely BECAUSE they're violent. Who do they think they're fooling, honestly? So in conclusion, don't let your personal feelings toward a filmmaker, or half-baked hatred of Christianity or other religions, taint your evaluation of an artistic work. You will end up on the same dead end roads of illogic that religious puritans frequent.",The Passion of the Christ

The costumes are great, the actual languages spoken even more so and the sensation so vivid you believe that you actually participate in the events. Of course the tortures and the bloodshed are the main part of the film, and to somebody who is not a Christian or hasn't studied the New Testament may seem cruel but these are the facts and I find them indispensable so as to understand the real sacrifice of Christ. On the other hand the form, the faces and the appearances of the devil (or in other words of temptation) are by far the best I have seen so far in films of this kind.I highly recommend this film to anyone no matter his religion.

All of a sudden his crap movie was all over the press, I am surprised if the marketing team even considered spending cash on poster boards when they got this much free airtime. As a result it caused huge intrigue into what all the noise was about and subsequently everybody wanted to see it and dutifully run off to the nearest multiplex.If wasn't for the fact that the subject matter of this movie was about the last hours of a guy called 'Jesus' nobody would have bothered going to see it, or very little at least. So from a different view its a fantastic commercial success for old Mel, produce something that some areas of society deem controversial, which creates enough distraction from how rubbish the actual product is. I read in the Sunday times that he put up 16 million of his own cash to produce this but he has got a 200 mil return, not bad Mel.I found it a very boring movie, grotesques yes, but you can get that from any old horror movie.

860,IntegrityInfuse,Putting the Hypocritical Naysayers to Rest...,10,26 February 2004,"i'm sorry.  i was expecting it.  i was dread it.  but it never threatened me.  i've seen far 'gorier' films than the Passion.  freddy vs. jason, titus, gladiator, bravehart, saving private ryan to name a few.  in my opinion, the hypocrisy among the critics is astonishing.  i can understand if some critics really felt like the message of jesus' love was overshadowed by his scourging (peter travers, rolling stone for example) - i can respect such reviews. but to call this a 'gorefest' - sadistic and even pornographically violent - is dishonest and wrong.  i hate gore.  i wince at blood and guts.  but i was able to watch with eyes were wide open.  no guts.  plenty of bruises, flesh and blood.  dont get me wrong - this deserved the R - but did not live up to the critics embellished NC17 reviews.  and such reviews come from the same critics that praised schindler's list for its realism and kill bill and titus (julie taymor) for their style, gladiator and braveheart for their bravery.  hmmm?futhermore, this was a depiction of reality.  schindlers list anyone? private ryan?  this happened.  this wasn't made up or intended for sensationalizing the death of jesus.  this was a window in time. definitely not entertainment, but an experience.  this is THE most famous death in the history of mankind - carrying with it both political and spiritual ramifications that have changed our world more than any other event in history.  i was pleased to see that history was preserved, giving us the political and theological context not found at face value in the Gospels. i believe mel's interpretation of pilate's role in the death of christ to be true to history despite the absolutism with which liberal scholars treat this event.  it is mel's interpretation of history and when put in context, it makes total sense (given the political ramifications combined with his wife's prophetic nightmare concerning Jesus...it makes absolute sense that he washed his hands free of Jesus' blood - but remember...although he didultimately condemn him to die, Jesus went willingly.  wow.)  and although there was no hint of anti-semitism, there was definitely a staggering sentiment of anti-corrupt-political-jewish-leaders-belonging-to-the-sanhedrin-in 33 AD-ism.   the message of this film couldn't be more obvious and anyone who misconstrues its intended message of Love - finding hate or any sense of malice - went to the movie looking to pick a fight with it.  Jesus' love couldn't be MORE obvious.  read the subtitles.bottom line:  mel did an EXCELLENT job focusing on the personhood of Jesus and on the lives of those who were touched by Him.  he created a moving picture with integrity.  it was as lyrical and poetic as it was real...exactly what he set out to do.  a real god as a real man met with real evil exuding real love.  wow.  a moving artistic cinematic portrait reminiscent of the rennaisance accentuated by a sweeping score, this was a beautiful film.

861,redwards13,How does this movie WORK on us?,4,11 February 2007,"Like all action movies, Passion of The Christ works using violence and the creation and release of tension, although not in the usual way.The usual way relies on ratcheting up tension in the audience and then releasing it in a way that has dramatic elegance (symmetry, catharsis etc.). The resolution of the modern movie's conflict lies in the first 20-30 pages of the script. The turning point in the first 20-30 pages signal a departure from normalcy, and we are returned to modified normalcy in the last 10 pages or so. The modern movie depicts its imbalance in all kinds of ways, and the action movie, from which Passion gets at least a fair amount of its DNA, usually relies on some form of brutality. In the war movie it's often atrocities by an unfeeling enemy and in Charles Bronson movies it's usually some poor underaged girl getting kidnapped and raped, but it's all doing the same big dumb thing: providing the emotional fuel necessary to make us embrace the violence that's going to set things right.At the risk of sounding like I'm trying to be clever, I turn now to Wikipedia:""The Latin phrase (deus ex machina) originated with Greek and Roman theater, when a mechane would lower actors playing a god or gods on stage to resolve a hopeless situation. The phrase is often translated as ""god from the machine"", where the machine referred to is the crane device employed in the task.""Now, we modern people (modern meaning post-Aristotle) typically think of deus ex machina as a cheap, unsatisfying way to solve dramatic situations. But if it's so cheap and crappy, how did it once become so popular? One answer is that if faith in and surrender to the deus in question are perceived by the audience as the only real and true ways to solve problems, deus ex machina starts to look a lot less cheap and crappy. Theater becomes a devotional ritual rather than a humanistic one. The surrender of one's ego-centric desires to faith in a higher power is an alternative way to release the anxiety created by conflict in the narrative. Most Christians believe that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus is fundamental to salvation, and Passion relies on this belief to solve its dramatic problems. Anger at the injustice done to Jesus is relieved by knowing that He is reborn, and that his rebirth not only solves all of His problems, but ours as well. Looking at the movie this way, it's easy to understand why so many people found the charges of anti-semitism to be beside the point: we don't leave the theater angry at the Jews because the problems of the movie have been solved without revenge. So although I found myself shaking my head and thinking, ""those stupid Jews"" a bunch of times (come on, admit it, so did you), I really don't think the movie's trying to stir up hatred. In the end I just felt sorry for the Jews, and is stirring up condescension really such a crime?That aside, Passion stirs up all kinds of other emotions through its extreme violence, and it's fair to examine the way it does this and to ask whether what it's doing is ethical and honest. The scenes of Jesus being tortured and humiliated are excruciating to watch. We watch them bracing ourselves at the blows that tear his flesh, at the extreme violence done to his body. We are filled with anxiety, and the movie uses this anxiety to bully us into accepting the resolution to its story: it freaks us out as much as it possibly can and gives our emotional pressure a singular escape route. People believe in Jesus as the savior for all kinds of reasons, but the least compelling one, and the only one that Passion's narrative thrust relies on, is that He was tortured to death. This is manipulative and cheap, partly because it's exploiting pre-existing assumptions that the audience presumably finds meaningful and important to add backbone to an unreflective narrative roller-coaster, but mostly because it's relying on the creation and alleviation of anxiety and repulsion to do this. How can there be any meaning in a journey that gets all its fuel from fear and repulsion? I don't see how its ray of hope at the end -- shining on an immaculate, naked Jim Caviezel with a CGI stigmata -- could seem satisfying to anyone who doesn't feel like being bullied into believing something, whether they already believe it or not.",The Passion of the Christ
862,bones-35,Wasted Opportunity,8,25 October 2004,"This movie has so much going for it, people speaking their native languages (or at least creating the impression of), wonderful scenery, attention to daily life detail (teeth, hair, roughness of cloth) and some great visual shots. The story, well loved by many, well know by most is compelling.However,the choices Mel Gibson makes in dishing out an orthodox view on 'the Passion' detract from the overall experience. The way Christ is bullied, beaten and humiliated might be correct, but the amount of blood he looses in the process is unrealistic. Nobody of human flesh could sustain that amount of injury and still walk, let alone carry a cross. Unless Mr Gibson's point is to show that Christ wasn't from human flesh most of the gore was over the top and detracted from the movie. In regards to the question of the portrayal of the jews in this movie, I think that Mr Gibson portrayed an establishment vs renegade point of view and therefore places the blame squarely at the feet of the establishment. That the establishment is Jewish is a fact of the story, but the actions are those of men with a vested interest in keeping the balance of power. I saw no derogatory portrayal of the jews as a people. The best analogy I can give is to compare the portrayal of the council members with the Spanish inquisition. Their actions reflect poorly on them as men, but should not be used to judge a religion.All in all, I feel that if Mr Gibson had chosen to listen to modern day church scholars on the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth, he would have made an equally powerful movie, without the firestorm of religious fervour surrounding it.8/10 overall impression, points subtracted for excessive use of repetition and visual theatrics.",The Passion of the Christ

I wanted to walk out 30 minutes in, but decided I needed to stick it out (BIG mistake) to wait for the message, which they never got around to. I went to this movie looking to learn more of the story of the final days of Christ, and to be inspired by His words. I was looking forward to that, but this film was not about the message. Instead, I got 2 hours which was mostly one long GROSSLY sensationalized torture scene, broken up by short sequences which did little to educate or elevate, only to provide a setup for the impossibly exaggerated torture, which was the body of the movie. Don't get me wrong, this movie is technically excellent, well shot and well acted -- it would merit a 10 for that. But it felt hollow -- and toxic. The story was sensationalized beyond belief (e.g.- no one could carry a heavy cross after losing most of their blood supply and going into shock, and the Romans knew this and wanted the death to occur on the cross, not before). When you watch this, you will understand why James Caviezel was actually struck by lightening while on the cross for the actual shooting of the film. Mel should have gotten the message.For those are trying to decide if they should see it, maybe this will help you decide: if you really enjoyed the torture scene from Braveheart, and would have preferred that the movie had been entirely focused on this torture, so it was made ten times more graphic and more than 20 times longer, but with no regard for what was realistic, then you will love this film. (The Braveheart story was mostly a fabrication, and even where facts were known they were ignored for entertainment value, but at least IT was an entertaining story.)In summation, there is an important story here, but they never bothered to tell it, or to get around to focusing on the message. That might have made the movie tolerable. When faced with possibly the most weighty historical and moral story of all time, they (as several other reviewers have noted) made a ""snuff film"" instead. This is the worst kind of film-making -- gratuitous, sadistic, shallow, and toxic. This is a disgusting film you should NEVER expose a child to, or anyone of normal sensitivity -- it is only for the thick skinned and truly jaded. I recommend you get your history from the History Channel, and the many excellent books and shows that get into a deeper discussion of the message. Read the other reviews and you will see similar reviews, or see Time (6/12/04, p. 70) for an excellent discussion of what the reviewer sees as ""...potent forms of cultural toxin..."".

All throughout, I was keenly aware of a supernatural something, a deep down inside sense that I was witnessing what everyone hopes for dreams of, longs for. Something that today we call solid love, a supernatural something that helps us to make it from day to day, year to year and in the middle of our problems we can reach out and share this Man's passion.If you're looking to criticize this film for its acting, sets, costumes, or directing I'm sure that you'll find a flaw here and there because it isn't perfect but what hits the mark and what matters to me is the correct portrayal of an historic figure and what He endured so that our lives can still be touched today.In my book, a must see film.

I left that movie feeling awful, and hating the people that did that to Him. And no not the Jews! The people laughing at His misery are who I hated. I'm pretty sure that's not how Jesus wants me to feel toward anyone though. Everyone else left completely silent, probably feeling bad too. It's been 2 years and I still have dreams about this movie and wake up feeling guilty! If it sent the message that Jesus willingly went through that whole thing because He loved us so much then I think it'd be good, but it didn't really emphasize that part.

881,Fury_Fighter,Diminishes Religion and Makes it Theaterical,1,7 June 2007,"I was forced to see this movie while I attended Catholic school, and if anything this movie dragged me further away from the Catholic faith than bring me closer to God. I honestly don't believe we should focus on the brutal killing of Jesus to reinforce our faith, we should read his teachings and learn lessons that way. I believe Mel Gibson tried to scare everyone into believing in Christ again and that's why this movie did so well, because honestly people are stupid. People get scared into believing that if you don't ""take up your cross"" you will burn in Hell.Basically a tip of advice, avoid this movie. The Catholic church should have been insulted by this movie. But of course the church is so corrupt these days that all they care about is the amount of money in the weekly collection and not the actual concept of the faith.Mel Gibson, you were a good actor but what the hell happened to you? All you did was boost church profits and diminish the true definition of the word faith.Don't see this movie, don't support it, don't even rent it. Movies like this should not be made, it destroys religion, not reinforce it.",The Passion of the Christ
882,rabauer08031,What was all the fuss about?,8,27 February 2004,"First, to all the people who complained about the gore and violence -- go watch your boxed set of ""the Sopranos"". To those who felt the movie should have been just more than the last hours of Jesus' life -- go rent ""King of Kings"", ""Jesus of Nazareth"" or ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"". This was about one very small portion of his life -- the final 12 hours -- nothing more and nothing less. We all know the backstories, so why cry for it?Now, what was all the fuss about? There is nothing new here that I hadn't seen in other adaptations of the story. I was compelled to see it because of the story itself. Gibson's vision was to interpret what he felt it must have been like for Jesus to go through what he had to go through. As a deeply religious individual, he wanted to drive home with the notion of how Jesus died for us. Nobody will ever know for sure what exactly happened at the time, but Gibson was compelled to do it with such ferocity as to say, ""Look, this is what this man did for you!"" And he makes the point.I do not believe this film is Anti-Semitic in the least. The Jewish Rabbis of the time were threatened by Jesus and his teachings, and they successfully manipulated the Romans into giving in to their demands. Every movie that I have seen has shown me the same thing. Pilate in each movie offers a choice between Jesus and Barabbas, and every time, the Jews choose Barabbas...not the Chinese, not the Norwegians or the French or the Egyptians...the Jews. What does a group to when it's leader calls for something? It follows the leader. There's nothing wrong with that. And Pilate, whom many say was barbaric in his ruling of the area, certainly didn't crucify or put to death anyone just because someone asked him to do so. To think otherwise would be ""Anti-Roman"" and making the Romans to be totally barbaric. Remember, these actions are those of the rulers, not the common people. To lump all Jews and all Romans together as being accountable is absurd.I think Gibson does a good job of using the flashbacks, and does so through the mind of Jesus, who finds release from the torture he is enduring. It gives the viewer a glimpse into the backstories that we all know.The cinematography, the lighting and the S*Y*M*B*O*L*I*S*M was on the mark. Slo-mo is used for a purpose, which is why they use it in sporting events, to drive the point home, to analyze. Nothing wrong with the use of it here.What surprised me the most was the pace of the film. The film seemed to move rather quickly, and did not feel like it was a 2:15 movie. However, as a recovering Catholic, it did nothing to re-establish any faith lost. It didn't stir me to rethink my values or to begin going to church again. This was one man's interpretation of the Bible, like so many others before him. It came from the heart, but it hasn't changed my mind about the one thing that I believe to be true: Religion is a dangerous avenue that has created many wars in its name. I will choose to believe in my own way, at my own pace, and where I choose. I do believe that Jesus would appreciate that about me, having seen the corruption of the Temples of his time, and the corruption of the religions of my time. And no movie can make me rethink that.",The Passion of the Christ
883,Elektrum,One of the best comedies of the year,3,2 April 2004,"Although 'The Passion of the Christ' is difficult to watch due to its tacky use of excessive gore, it can be taken as an amusing comedy. We are given a glimpse of Mel Gibson's warped mind, and it is fascinating from a psychological perspective. Thankfully, there remain handfuls of individuals whose brains have not been raped and tortured into faithful obedience. Such individuals may appreciate their own fortune as they witness the atrocity exhibition (simply fabulous) that is Mel Gibson's mind. The fact that countless confused individuals find this masochistic horror show to be a touching and spiritual film is an indication of how barbarously ignorant our society as a whole remains.The self-critical clichés of recent times are brought to mind by this film: technology has brought us along a bit, but how far removed, in terms of barbaristic* ignorance, are we from our ancestors?That 'The Passion of the Christ' has been met with mostly widespread appreciation forces us to realize how intellectually impoverished some of our fellow citizens are. My dramatic delivery is clearly unnecessary, as this revelation regarding ignorance-that-persists was made long ago and is repeated often enough.",The Passion of the Christ
884,imercado,"""I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.""",10,28 February 2004,"I was moved to tears more deeply by this film than any other I have ever witnessed.  We will likely never see another film that will cause each viewer to clearly depict what he or she believes about the meaning of Christ's suffering.  Christ himself said in Matthew 10:34 ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."".  You can see this for yourself by the polarization between the reviews rating this film a 10 and those rating this film a 1.

885,rdspafford,Violence for effect,7,23 March 2004,"There were some powerful moments in this film, and I particularly liked the cinematic device of taking present tense images as keys to memories of similar events/scenes/images from Jesus' life and ministry. On the other hand, the time frame and Christ's ministry sequence that this movie encompasses has so many rich, spiritual, deeply meaningful events and images that I felt cheated when Mel Gibson chose to make the physical and psychological violence against Christ the absolute centerpiece of this film. Violence is not something I object to in film when used properly. For instance, I did not find ""Natural Born Killers"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" excessively violent. I did find this film excessively violent. Mel Gibson is pushing our face in it, he's using violence for effect. Perhaps he wants us to understand what Jesus went through. I think we do. Perhaps he wants us to experience his pain and humiliation so we will... what? Suffer, too? Feel a deeper connection with Christ? I've really like Mel Gibson's work, but this technically well-crafted movie is the product of extremism, and not the extreme love that Christ offers people, nor the extreme sacrifice he made for our salvation. It is the extremism of self-indulgent brutality, and I object to it. There are good things here as well: the Aramaic language with subtitles, the cinematography, the direction, and best of all, the ending inside the tomb as Jesus rises and begins His resurrected life. That was a brilliant way to end the film, but ultimately, this film does not focus on Christ's Passion, but on his human pain. That was a mistake.",The Passion of the Christ
886,JFogliasso,Amazing...,10,26 February 2004,"I have waited until I saw this movie before posting a comment on it. Now that I have seen it here goes...I feel that this is perhaps the most thought provoking movie I have ever seen. By watching the graphic scenes of violence the audience is left to contemplate why Jesus would let them hurt him so. I will not decide for others if they will like the movie or not, I don't yet know if I did. I am glad I saw it and plan to see it again, but it is incredibly hard to sit through the movie and watch the pain and suffering Jesus went through.As for all of the talk on this movie being anti-Semitic... The actress that portrays Jesus' mother Mary is actually Jewish. She does not feel that the movie is anti-Semitic, and neither do many Jews. But, I do see how the Anti-Defamation League could find things to complain about. The High Priests are made into very one-dimensional characters while Pontius Pilot is portrayed as a torn man.BUT, I do believe that the events happened in the way that was portrayed, and that the movie does not promote hating of the Jewish people. In fact, during the movie Mel had clips of the sermon on the mount where Jesus reminds us to forgive our enemies, and another clip of him at the last supper saying that no man could take his life from him if he were not laying it down already. And finally, that there is no greater love than this...to lay down ones life for their friends. While the high priests were portrayed as one-dimensional the movie was not supposed to be about them, it was about Jesus, and the pain and suffering that he bore for the sins of mankind.My final point is this...I have also heard that the movie deals too much with the violence HE went through and not enough on the life or resurrection of Jesus. This particular movie was not supposed to be about the life or the resurrection of Jesus, it is ""The Passion"". It is supposed to remind us of an uncomfortable fact, that Jesus went through more than any of us could bear in order to show his great love for us and forgive our sins.In conclusion, I do recommend that you go see this movie, give it a chance, take time to reflect on what you have seen, and then come to your own conclusion on what you feel of this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
887,taymc,I have never seen a movie that had this kind of effect on me.,10,28 February 2004,"The Passion of The Christ is a cinematic achievement. If the purpose of a film is to elicit some kind of emotion then this film is the best I have ever seen. It is not entertaining in a light hearted sense. But, it is not boring either. It is visceral. At the end of my viewing the theater sat in stunned silence. For me it was like watching my best friend brutalized for two hours. Yet the mood developed through beautiful dark photography and imagery was mesmerizing. I did not want to look at times but could not force myself to look away. I probably will not be able to go see it a second time but I am glad I saw it the first time. Beyond its achievement in movie history it had a deeply personal effect on me.

889,danny0206,Awesome Movie!,10,3 March 2004,I was very moved by this emotional film. It really helped to strengthen by deep Catholic faith! Jim Caviezel and Mel Gibson are to be applauded for this production. This movie will make you realize how much Jesus loved all of us and died for our sins so that we could have eternal life in Heaven. It made me shed some tears especially the scenes where Jesus was interacting with his Mother and other people while carrying the cross. I only wish they had spent a little bit more time with the Resurrection scene. Everyone should see this movie whether they are Catholic or not. God Bless Jim Caviezel and Mel Gibson.,The Passion of the Christ
890,PhotoBrent,The Cardinal Sin of Movie-making: Boring!,1,24 March 2008,"I watched this movie with a former girlfriend, a devout Catholic. She hoped the movie would make a dent in my atheism. At the end of the movie, she said, ""Well, that was a waste of time! I believe the story, but I found the movie incredibly boring, and I can't imagine it has changed your feelings about it one bit."" She was right on both counts.Forget the historical inaccuracies, since no one really knows what happened during that time period anyway. Forget that other contemporary historians of the time period made no mention of this miracle worker or of his crucifixion. Forget that crucifixion, when it was performed, put the nails through the wrist because putting them through the hands would just result in them tearing through. Forget that the bible itself has various versions of what happened.If you see a movie you should expect to get something worthwhile out of it. Gallons of fake blood do not make a movie worthy, and all of the focus on suffering just convinced me that if Jesus ever existed and actually went through all of that, he had to be insane.",The Passion of the Christ
891,tannacker,One of the best movies ever.,10,29 February 2004,"I'm not religious but I was very moved by this movie. Yes it is very brutal at times, but Jesus' last hours were just that, brutal. I know that there has been a lot of controversy over this film because of its content, but the movie speaks for itself. The movie details the last 12 hours of Jesus' life including the betrayal by his disciples and the Temple Rabbis. The latter of course angered Jewish groups, who complained that it will cause anti-semitism. Please give us all a break Jesus was a Jew, so to hate the Jews would be to hate one's own saviour. All I have to really tell everyone is go and see it for yourselves and decide on your own what you think of the movie. It was worthy of my $10.25. Mel Gibson out did himself and he definitely deserves the Oscar for Best Director, and James Caviezel deserves the Oscar for Best leading Male Actor at next years Oscar ceremonies.",The Passion of the Christ
892,itmanager,Captions?,1,29 February 2004,"I have to agree with most, that this movie was very well produced.  The look and feel that Mel Gibson gave to this movie was very moving and well told. I think it is a good movie but it could have been better if were not for the captions.  I understand the attempt to make it as authentic as possible and the feeling it extends by having the actors use the language of the times. However, by having captions throughout the entire movie made me feel like I was watching a foreign film.  This, in my opinion, degraded the quality of the film by forcing the audience to continually look at the bottom of the screen.  I am one that likes to view scenes closely and if you are the same then this film will leave you feeling like you may have missed something, especially at times when the dialog was long.  I know that the ""passion"" in this movie would have come across a whole lot more and made a greater impact if english was spoken by all, especially the role of Jesus.  When he spoke the most popular words that all Christians recognize it would have had a much deeper impact on us all if we heard it in our on tongue.  Hearing him speak it in a language that 99% of us do not understand and then having to read it to know what he said just took away from any feeling the character was attempting to convey.At first I was hoping that Mel would do like other films and start off with dialogs, switching to english very quickly.

893,mr__hyde,Interesting more than touching,7,25 February 2004,"I made sure to see this film at the first showing in my town on opening day, and I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed. Overall, only two things set this apart from a typical Hollywood film: the religious tone and the subtitles. The film uses every Hollywood trick in the book to evoke an emotional response from it's viewers: slow motion camera, deep/heartfelt music swells, flashbacks.... I would have liked to see Mr. Gibson be a little more creative in his telling of the story. The only thing that set this apart from any other biblical epic was the vast amounts of blood. Never before has Jesus been shown beaten even close to this brutally, and it looks extremely real. As a believer in the historical significance and truth, but a non-believer in the religious sense, this film did not do much for me. I have no desire to re-read the gospels or attend church after seeing this film. I will be less inclined to see Mr. Gibson's next directorial foray, but not totally turned off. I would recommend this more as a curiousity than for it's greatness. I gave it 7 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
894,jkitts,a must see...,10,29 February 2004,"The most stunning film since Schindler's List. But in true comparison of impact alone, it makes the other film a short. Jim Caviezel is very believable and balanced. Mel Gibson put it all on the line. And the audience is the real winner. We get to see for the first time a film about a Man who changed history and we get to see it in all its starkness. There will probably be none better. I will never be the same since watching it. My hope is that it continues to draw debate and controversy. That is what He wanted us to do about Him to begin with. As I left the theater I listened as grown people openly wept. Was the movie `preaching to the choir' as some has said? Maybe, but we have to realize that we all have a part to sing in the `choir'. We all must see the need to harmonize with each other and the world around us. If this movie did one thing real well; it showed how flawed we all are and how well we try to hide it. It could be that the people affected were just real people seeing themselves in a different light than before. Somehow we have lost the need to just be real. Jesus was a real man, preaching a real message, reaching out to real people. I think it's high time we reach toward Him.",The Passion of the Christ
895,Slaytanic1,Somewhat Dull,2,6 January 2005,"As far as I'm aware this film portrays the last hours of Christ as written in the Bible accurately, but as a cinematic experience it is rather a dull affair. The scenes of torture and in particular Christ carrying the cross go on so long that you become totally numb to it all. Initially the violence seems quite graphic but after watching 20 minutes of someone stumbling through the desert and falling over you just become bored of it all, losing any sympathy for the character you may have built up. In truth that sympathy is hard to come by anyway as none of the character's are given any sort of introduction or depth, it 's purely our mythological/historical knowledge of them that's supposed to carry the characterisation's. Outside of committed Christians or sado-masochists I can't see who this film would appeal to - personally I'll stick with Life of Brian.",The Passion of the Christ
896,wgfp-1,"Overall, an effective film.",10,8 March 2004,"I think Gibson's beliefs are self-evident here and since it's his film, he presents his beliefs as ""the gospel."" The film is gripping. Undeniably gripping. The flagellation scenes are a bit over done, in my opinion. One observation, the trek to the cross is a bit absurd, the Romans are depicted whipping Jesus so severely he keeps falling and can barely make it to the top? Would they have done that? Doubtful. More likely, they would've wanted him to get up there and get it over with? Jim Caveizel was oddly right for the role. Looked like what I would think Jesus looked like? The cinematography was excellent. Sound was superb. All in all, a gripping film. I will admit, the Jewish High Rabbis do come out looking bad in this film. Not, however, the Jewish populace. I was moved by the film.",The Passion of the Christ
897,gville101,Shocked!,10,26 February 2004,"I went to see this movie on opening night after having read a few critical reviews about it.  I was expecting a very violent movie, but nothing could have prepared me for what I got.  During the first 45 minutes or so, I found my self wondering what these critics were talking about (a punch here a slap there).  However, the next hour and 15 minutes contained the most shocking and horrifying images I have ever seen.  I cannot begin to describe the sick and brutal way in which Jesus was tortured and beaten in this movie.  I'll leave it up to you to go see the movie. The acting was brilliant across the board.  I really thought that James Caviezel did a wonderful job portraying Christ.  He perfectly portrayed his physical pain while still showing sympathy for those who inflicted pain upon him.  Everything else: costumes, sets, makeup(wonderful job here especially with all the wounds on his body) was perfect as well. One final thing I will say about this movie is that it is very very hard to watch.  I am a fan of screen violence, but this is just totally different. Trust me when I say you have NEVER seen anything like this in the movies.  I literally almost walked out of the theater a couple of times.  This is a very good movie that I am glad I saw but I don't think I could ever watch it again.  I must warn you though, it is certainly not for everyone.",The Passion of the Christ
898,lgothard,A life changing movie...,10,5 March 2004,I was reluctant to see this movie knowing it would involve so much torture and hate. I was happy I went. I am a Christian but also a normal person. I think sometimes we forget what Jesus went through for us and the teachings he wanted us to remember. I will try to always love my enemies and follow the Commandments. When I find it hard I will think back to this movie. The acting was great and the story line powerful. Everyone should see this movie. It will show you what Jesus as a man went through for us. It was unbelievable.,The Passion of the Christ
899,director-editor,Crucifixion or cashifixion...?,5,25 February 2004,"Just came from the opening-day screening of The Passion, and the cynic (read: realist) in me says, ""Another crucifixion film; just more blood 'n' guts!"".Now, please understand that I'm neither an agnostic nor a theological liberal; in fact, I'm an ordained deacon who happens to be a film editor, by trade. Watching it, I had my analysis-meter running at full power (sad that I can't just sit back and enjoy a flick, isn't it?) and it's very apparent that the producers played on the well-anticipated press-release press that this movie received to insure a Christian nation-full of packed theaters.The concerns by the Jewish community are not at all baseless; there are several lines delivered during Jesus' trials (before Pilate and Herod) that give a subtle message that (in spite of protests by Franklin Graham and Mel Gibson himself) maybe the Jews really are to blame for all this.  These lines, in my humble opinion, did nothing to help the plot (and were not at all historically or theologically sound), but they will sell tickets.Likewise, the scriptural liberties (like Caiphas declaring to the mob, ""He tells us that by eating his flesh and blood, we will have eternal life"", when the words that Caiphas inaccurately paraphrased had only been uttered by Jesus hours earlier, to a group of eleven...how did Caiphas know?) and a marked bias toward Roman Catholic doctrine give this film less of a sheen.Someone is going to make gobs of money from this film (considerably more than Judas' thirty pieces of silver), which reminds me of words by my late father (himself a minister): ""If there's a buck to be made in religion, someone'll get it!"".  But I'm not totally panning the film; it has moments when the armchair-theologian in me is surprised by careful attention to certain Scriptural minutia that even a lot of preachers leave unnoticed. It is graphic -- and probably could be more so; crucifixions are not pretty -- and to Christians, a reasonable reminder of how our Savior's last hours may have been.Also, the big-budget perks, like exquisite makeup, incredible sets and some of the most convincing motion-control camera/compositing I've seen, make this one worthy of a watch.  The subtitles (the film is voiced entirely in ancient Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic) were not nearly as tedious as I expected them to be.To those who are experiencing the story for the first time through this movie, please understand that it IS a movie and is not precisely true to Scripture.  I would strongly recommend, in no uncertain terms, the old saying that has been going around ever since film was invented: If you want to find out what really happened, read the book!",The Passion of the Christ
900,grisez,Good film with some defects.,9,13 March 2004,"Of the many films about Jesus I have seen, this one seems to me best, all things considered. Still, it has important defects.Movies about Jesus never are entirely true to the New Testament; The Passion diverges from it less than others. Scenes are well constructed, and their sequence is clear. Casting of the main characters is excellent and the actors who play the main characters do very well. Photography is very good. The musical score is acceptable.Passion plays have a long history; they were never meant to entertain, but rather were a devotional exercise. At times and in places where antisemitism was prevalent, passion plays, like much else in the culture, were corrupted by that irrational hatred. The New Testament itself is not antisemitic: Jesus, Mary, John the Baptizer, the Twelve, Paul, and almost all the other New Testament figures that Christians regard as saints were Jews. Mel Gibson's The Passion is not antisemitic.Jesus' message and undertaking were profoundly divisive; they divided his own people, and continue to divide people today. Plainly, some of the bitter criticism of this film--especially that by critics who have manifested their anti-Christian bias over the years--is motivated by hatred of Jesus rather than a fair evaluation of the film itself.Still, The Passion does have its defects. The scourging is overdone, not because it is too brutal, but because the amount of injury depicted is not credibly consistent with Jesus being able to stand up, much less walk or carry anything.Given the history of antisemitism contaminating passion plays, Gibson ought to have been more sensitive to the sensitivity of many Jews. Members of the Sanhedrin need not have been shown in scenes where their presence is not mentioned in the gospels. Children need not have been shown tormenting Judas. Pilate need not have offered Jesus a drink. Many devout Jews believed in Jesus; the contempt for them of leading members of the Sanhedrin and their fear that his popularity would provoke the Romans (see Jn 11:47-50) ought to have been shown.There are also many less significant defects. ""I make all things new"" does not fit the passion. Satan's appearances after the opening scene are distracting and implausible. The final scene shows the linen cloths lying but fails to show the napkin rolled up by itself (see John 20:7).All in all, however, The Passion is well done. I hope Gibson will get to work, with the same cast, on a sequel: The Resurrection of the Christ.",The Passion of the Christ

905,red_hallow,Is the film anti-Semitic? N-o-!!! 100% N-O-,10,2 March 2004,"`The Passion of the Christ' is a beautifully filmed, disturbingly graphic reconstruction of the last hours of Jesus Christ, the Christian God and Savior. Mel Gibson captures the brutality of His torture and execution, as well as the deep despair felt by His followers and loved ones. Visually, it is exactly what you would expect from the director of `Braveheart.'
In this movie, Jews are portrayed very much as they acted in the Bible. It is true that Jewish leaders felt threatened by the ministry of Jesus and that they conspired to have him killed by the Romans. The movie does not take great pains to explain that it was Jesus' choice, not the actions of others, that lead to his crucifixion, but it does show Jesus saying as much in a flashback. In the end, only a person who considers the Bible to be anti-Semitic could possibly place the same accusation against this film.""The Passion of the Christ"" is just about the cruelest film you're ever likely to see. This film deals predominantly with the arrest, the trial, and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Nothing this graphic has ever been tried before. It's a film relentless in its agony as we see nothing but pain and suffering done onto Jesus through almost the entire length of the film. Although the film isn't intended for everyone, it's definitely worthy of anyone who needs affirmation of what Jesus Christ may have sacrificed for Christians. The fact that some of the tormentors are Jewish does not make the film anti-Semitic as some people have declared. Most of Jesus' followers are Jewish, and his own background is Jewish too. Jesus was killed by political groups with agendas - much like how people going to see the movie with negative preconceptions are people with agendas too.An overlooked fact is that nearly all sympathetic and generous characters in the movie are Jews. This includes the heroic Simon (Jarreth Merz), who takes on the burden of the cross, Jesus' mother, Mary (Maia Morgenstern), who shows great sorrow and a preternaturally close relationship with her son, and Jesus Christ himself (James Caviezel).What about the film's other big controversy? Is it excessively bloody? Perhaps. Gibson goes to great lengths to show the physical destruction of Jesus at the hands of the Romans. It is not unreasonable to assume that He did, in fact, suffer such intense torture.Now that those issues have been addressed, I can get on with the review. The question is now one of how effective this movie is. What is the intention of The Passion of the Christ and what does it achieve? How accurate is it?Without being too specific, Mel Gibson changed some things and kept others the same. The intense suffering and brutal death of Jesus could reasonably be inferred from the Bible itself. Torture and humiliation are horrible by their very nature. To sanitize this important aspect of Jesus' life would do a disservice to everyone. On the other hand, many of Jesus' interactions with the Jewish leaders and with Pontius Pilate are farther off the mark. They ignore the fact that even in his debilitated state, Jesus still had much to say and a compelling way of saying it. This results in a Jesus to be pitied, a Jesus who does not seem to maintain the enormous strength of character that he possesses in the Bible. In addition, Gibson adds many images of devils, demons, and possessed children that have no biblical precedent. Images like these undermine the film.The movie's great shortcoming is that it is not universally accessible. For those who have never heard of Jesus Christ, or have heard of him but have only a vague idea of his ministry and the enormous cultural impact he has had on society, this movie will seem to have come from nowhere and to have gone nowhere. It will simply appear to be a two hour-long snuff film, an unbearably gruesome sequence of flying flesh and puddles of blood. It is The Faces of Death in Aramaic. It is sickening, causing audience members to cry and to vomit. Worst of all, the violence does not appear to have a purpose, as the victim appears innocent and his crime unworthy of such inhuman treatment. Mel Gibson's point is obvious: pity this man.
Are we supposed to pity Him though? Is that the intention of the Gospels? Now we are entering into a completely different realm of analysis, one that cannot be avoided. This is a religious film, and it needs to be treated as such. To look at it any other way ignores the goal of the filmmaker. How does this film work considering that its intended viewership is an audience that is already familiar with the story? If Mel Gibson set out to make a movie that shows merely the great suffering and death of Jesus Christ, than he has met and exceeded his goal. This is not, however, the complete scope of the film.The film seeks to inspire, to remind the viewer that Jesus Christ suffered and died for his or her sins (whether you, the reader, believe as much is not the point. Complain to Mel Gibson). It seeks to bring God face to face with His people just before His greatest glory. To do this, Christ is first completely broken down. The Passion of the Christ fulfills its apparent goals. The enormous magnitude of His sacrifice becomes abundantly clear.
I found, however, that my experience was much different than that of the average viewer. I unintentionally edited out the parts that either had no biblical reference or could not be reasonably inferred from the text of the bible. This was my mistake. I realize this now. The viewer cannot edit out the extraneous lines, or enter in the ones he thinks (or knows) should have been said. To do so is to give Mel Gibson too much credit, to believe that he made this movie for the viewer when, in truth, he made it for himself. It must be remembered at all times that `The Passion of the Christ' is not a Gospel. Many of the events and conversations that were either added to or omitted from the original biblical stories subtly change the meaning of the events and even the character of Jesus. The changes are small, but with this movie the Devil is in the details, both literally and figuratively.
You should see `The Passion of the Christ.' There is no question about that. If you are Christian, it will likely reaffirm your faith by giving you an appreciation for Christ's suffering and death. If you are not Christian, it will give you some idea about an event with great significance to Christians. My only recommendation for both groups is to always keep in mind that this movie is the product of Mel Gibson's faith alone and should be viewed as such.
The bottom line is that The Passion of the Christ is an astonishing cinematic achievement, utterly riveting from start to finish. Intense and dramatic, the film's only real drawback is the hardcore violence - which will undoubtedly turn off a large number of viewers. Still, you'd be hard pressed to find a more engaging and deeply moving film than this one; it's the kind of movie one wishes for when sitting through the seemingly neverending barrage of cliched, inept Hollywood product. Gibson's created a classic that will be debated for years to come, and though there are no easy answers, the film's place among the most revered historical epics is undeniable.**********  out of **********",The Passion of the Christ
906,rivendal,A matter of taste,9,12 April 2004,"Mel Gibson reveal himself as an excellent director, hardworking one, even stubborn he looks to me whenever some of his ""strange"" ideas have to be realized. Here are two aspects this movie should be commented through. As a movie by itself, is a splendid one. Technical is correct, actors are brilliant, costumes are almost perfect, also the city in the south of Italy, ancient as it is (being a part of northern Levant under the Roman Empire) is a most suitable location. Backdrops (sets) of the walls and other architectonic constructions, made in ""Cinecitta"", as similar as it possible to the original ones in Jerusalem, are convenient enough. Something especially fascinated me, it is a using of two ancient languages, Aramaic (which is still in use) and roman Latin (though, even this Latin ""slang"" was indeed in use in old Palestine and other roman provinces, actors don`t use it proper, but in so-called ""Italian pronunciation"" which was not like in that period). So, as I said, movie is very good, and this was a first aspect, the technical one. The other is about the main story, better said the historical context. Gibson directed his movie mostly holding on the three synoptic Gospels. According this fact, the debate about cruelty or improperly connotations in this realization is absolutely unnecessary and bizarre. Is that a realistic description, I have to say (as an archaeologist), yes, it was just like that. Torching, beating, crucify and so on, were the system of usual punishment and death, no matter it was Christ or any other convicted person, in that time (but, please, not only in that place and among this people!!!). So, if those Gospels telling it was the real story, and if anyone want to believe so (Mel is one of them), than simply it was like that. It is just a matter of taste is Gibson`s movie (according to the Gospels) well done or not. I have to admit I myself hardly endured some of the scenes. Anyway, the debates about the movie are complete improperly and tasteless. Please, take a look at our world nowadays and compare. I found one more interesting thing, it`s that one of the Christ`s adepts watching crucify with Christ`s mother Maria and Maria Magdalena, of which the three Gospels tell nothing, save John who in his Gospel (non synoptic one) all the time telling about him as the most beloved by Christ, for this Gospel is a pretty different from the synoptic ones. As a conclusion I shall say this is an excellent movie. Here is just one question that have to be asked...do the Gospels telling us complete truth?",The Passion of the Christ
907,jlarmstr,Thank you Mr. Gibson,10,29 February 2004,"Wow......(wait 5-10 minutes)....wow......(wait 5-10 minutes more)....wow again, now try to collect yourself and comprehend what was just seen. This was my impression of Passion of the Christ.  My next impulse simply was this:Thank you Mel Gibson, thank you for reminding us!On to the commentary.  I am most always fascinated to see a ""Jesus"" film released, as films like Passion typically generate massive controversy and this is no exception.  The Last Temptation of Christ was the most recent mainstream controversial ""Jesus"" film but for other reasons.  However, unlike LTC, Passion was a way of expressing on film, as accurately as possible to the Gospels, the ultimate sacrifice. Gibson did so very well. Did Gibson take liberties?  Perhaps, but none that would detract from the true accounting as written in Mathew, Mark, Luke or John (and nothing like LTC did).  Was he accurate?  Most certainly, the entire sequence of events as biblically related, were true to form.  The film is moving, very well acted, well directed, and powerful to watch.  In this commentary, rather than get to the details of the movie, I would like to address the two major criticisms.First, some critics have stated, paraphrased of course: ""I did not see the love and forgiveness of Jesus, I saw only violence, blood, and hate"". These type of critics, in my opinion, completely miss the point and are likely more ignorant of the story matter than what they are willing to admit. The film was made on Christ's last 12 hours, His darkest hour, the hour of sacrifice and His death.  Was it brutal? Yes. Was there hate? Yes. Was it violent?  Try, being scourged, beaten, crowned with thorns, and having your hands / feet nailed to a wooden cross then answer that question.  However, these were not actions of Christ toward men, rather of ignorant men toward Christ. Even in the face of this, Christ forgives and I simply cannot understand how this was missed by the critics.Second, some critics have accused the film of being anti-semantic.  Again they are off the mark, in my opinion anyway.  Christ was not crucified by all Jews, he was condemned by the Pharisees who happen to be Jewish. Therefore, blaming anyone of Jewish faith for the death of Jesus is simply wrong. If there is any animosity to be generated, then it might be against the bloated religious leaders who wish to destroy the one man that might challenge their power over the people, who were threatened by Christ's claims to be the Son of God.  Even today, there are those who will use their religious position (and who are NOT Jewish) to justify wanting taking of other life, to further their goals, retain their own view, and force upon others their personal interpretations of good and evil. There are those who will ignorantly dismiss those who are not of their religion as evil, Godless, and without merit.  Nevertheless, the film (and Scripture) portrays Christ's forgiveness of those who committed these brutal acts - and within the context of the film, just a remarkable job.Movies on the life, death, and resurrection are sure to generate talk. The subject matter is one of such personal conviction, and each individual wishes to have his/her belief's be right.  On this matter, there is no doubt each individual must reconcile his/her own ""vision"" of the subject matter, then decide whether to see this movie or not.  Make no mistake, in viewing Passion one will witness a graphic portrayal of the worlds most famous historical event.  Side note: There is no doubt that 2000 years ago, a man named Jesus was crucified, both secular and nonsecular accountings exist to verify this fact.  The controversy will always be -- was Jesus who he claimed to be, this is for each person to decide.On the whole, my opinion is ""Masterpiece"".  The thanks goes to Mel Gibson, the praise goes to, well, if you can't figure that out then you should not see the movie.",The Passion of the Christ
908,napalm-6,A Beautifully Gory Story,10,26 February 2004,"Whether or not you believe in God, this is one of the finest and most beautifully done films ever made. One does not watch this movie- one experiences this movie.The critics have had reviews across the board. Some say it's too gory without a decent story, and others call it one of the most moving films they have ever experienced. In my book, this film is extremely gory, but has more power to it than any other film I have ever seen. Yes, Jesus gets the hell beaten out of him and his body is torn and broken. But while critics stop there and say, ""The violence numbs you after a while and no true passion or feeling emerges from Jesus,"" they could not be any more wrong. For you see, Jesus speaks seldomly, and when he does, he points no fingers. Instead, forgives those who do wrong unto him. And there is true passion, folks: Jim Caviezel emits Jesus' inner feelings not through words or actions like the critics expect him to, but rather, through his deep and wonderous eyes, peering out of the blood oozing from around them.This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is not anti-Semitic in the slightest, no matter what some bigots on television may say. It preaches the true Passion, and blows every other movie out of the water.",The Passion of the Christ
909,nocomments87,Very touching and nearly accurate...,7,21 March 2004,"No doubt Mel Gibson did a very smart move when he did this movie. Advertising wasn't even necessary due to all of the news about the movie...before it even came out. If you've read the Bible, then you already know the whole story, but that shouldn't stop you from watching the movie. Honestly, I don't think it is as controversial as what people make it seem. The Jews don't even believe in the New Testament...why should they complain now? Besides, the Romans did the damage, not the Jews (the Jews only agreed to it). Everything seemed to be pretty accurate (only thing that really wasn't accurate was the nailing on the cross...Jesus was nailed on his wrists, not on the hands themselves). What I liked best was the fact that Gibson tried to keep the language as authentic as possible. For those who haven't seen the movie yet...what are you waiting for? If you can stomach all of the gory stuff, then do see it ASAP. If you can't, that's understandable, since there are many scenes which involve Jesus being beaten down...whether it be via hands, sticks, or the worst of all...the whip (complete with led on the ends of the whip). I definitely give the movie a 10/10. The acting was phenomenal, the effects were amazing, and the movie itself is definitely the best scripture-to-movie translation.",The Passion of the Christ

I had to see this movie. When the movie was over I was pretty distressed. I absolutely loved the movie. The violence was pretty horrendous but it was really necessary. Mel Gibson had outdone himself as a director. I thought it was a brilliant piece of work.The performances were top-notch. James Caviezel was absolutely superb as Jesus. Monica Belluci was great as Mary Magdalene and Maia Morgenstern was heartbreaking as Mary.Caleb Deschanell's cinematography was breathtaking in its beauty and John Debney's music was so beautiful that it made me cry, along with the two of the film's most violent scenes, The Scourging and The Crucifixion. But the film's main star was Mel Gibson. I admire him for having the courage to making this movie. It was beautiful.

It makes me question wether or not his death was worth it! For all the awful sinners out there, was his pain worth it.I don't feel worthy after seeing the portrale of his pain.Don't go to see this if you are very sensitive. Several people walked out of this movie.The devil was an interesting character. Played by a woman and very surreal. A good image  if rather hard to understand in some parts.What was the meaning of him holding that ugly baby? ectI doubt non christians will enjoy this much.

The path he has followed through his carreer led him quite plainly and unavoidably to this film, a place I am certain he did not expect to find himself.  This film is in a category of its own.  There has never been a Christian or other film of this importance and magnitude.  It is extremely difficult to attempt to describe this film with mere words.  A picture is worth a thousand of them, and every shot of that film contains its own meaning.  The essential truth is that many will not like it.  Many will hate it.  Not because they don't appreciate the quality, but because they despise the message. Christ suffered for us, suffered more than our imaginations can even fathom, and that presents the idea that we owe Him.  This does not sit well with many viewers.  Many will try to pass it off as saying that they didn't like it because Mel Gibson has some gruesome fixation on violence or some such rubbish, and they may even themselves believe this to be true.  But the crux of the matter is, their hearts are hardened.  They refuse to let themselves belive the truth because it is too harsh, too painful, and too demanding to believe.

Passion asks us to prostrate ourselves before God and Jesus once again. God allows his son to be tortured to death for our supposed sins. Really? Thanks dad. I left the movie in awe at Mel Gibson's ability as a director. But then got angry at his message. It seems that the leaders in ancient Rome were hapless weaklings doing the bidding of the Jewish people. There is a scene in the movie (in Aramaic) where a Jewish mob asks for Jesus's blood to pour onto the heads of its children. This by the way is written in only one of four Gospels - that contradict each other. This is all part of the movie's intention to damn the Jews and propagate disgusting lies spread 2,000 years ago. Yes, let's tackle the Jewish question again and the fact that we are supposed to believe they had Jesus Christ killed. This has been handed down through the centuries.

The story of Jesus, told with all the gory realism and relentless horror that apparently someone must have been waiting for. Maybe I wasn't one of those people. Maybe that's why every time I think back on this film I am disgusted by it a little more. Maybe, like most Christians, I knew that the death of Christ was a horrific, torturous end to a great man (if you are not Christian, please do not be offended by my remarks, simply note that these are my personal beliefs). Maybe that's why when Gibson called the film a ""reality check for Christians"" I thought ""torturous death being nailed to a tree by people you've never harmed, I got the picture already Mel."" So anyway I was drawn in by the controversy and the rave reviews of my friends and thought ""Why not?"" Well, let's start off with the summation of the film. Jesus Christ is being beaten for two and a half hours that I can never have back for my life. How is it that the talented director of ""Braveheart"" could make a film with no development, no real character treatment, and a dialogue-torture ratio of 1:30? James Caviezel is an amazing actor, even in the hoax that was ""Highwaymen"", but this film gives him almost no chance to display his amazing talents, which is a shame since he's in a role as compelling as that of Christ. That is indeed the biggest shame of this film. Instead of taking a great opportunity to focus on the man, it is another attempt at shock-value, but because of its religious base it has ""artistic value"", whereas when such gore showcased by directors like Tarantino and Fincher is viewed as ""grotesque"" and ""unnecessary"". This is a film I could have lived a more happy life without ever seeing. The cinematography is good, but that aspect alone does little to make up for how horrifyingly wasted the director's and actors' talents are.

After the first 45 minutes of the movie, I found myself dozing off. But I forced myself to stay awake so that I may watch the whole movie, because by that time I was so irritated by how slow and dull it is that I wanted to see the overall damage and thus I would be able to accurately comment on it in my views. The only part that I was actually wide awake was that short scene where Jesus gets whipped by the Romans and the part when they crucify him. That's only just as 'entertaining'(don't take the use of this word wrongly) as it gets.Alright, maybe 'entertaining' was not the right word to use. What I mean to say is, those two scenes were the only scenes that were good in the movie. Yes, it is sad to see a man get tortured in such a way, be it Jesus or be it Saddam. To see how cruel Man can be to that extent. Yes, I will admit, the effects of the skin ripping and the blood and the acting was quite commendable. And I admit that I felt some pain in my own skin when Jesus was whipped with that whip with the sharp hooks at the tips. Those parts were good. One will really feel sorry for the poor soul. But I am commenting on the overall of the movie. The costumes, they lack originality and design. They were far too plain and simple for the big screen.

923,marnixsalomons,This is a great movie...,9,19 December 2004,"...It just is. I am not Christian, though this movie can still touch my heart, deeply. Unlike many other 'reviewers' I do not criticize the amount of gore - if it is fair to brand-mark it with this term - but see a sympathy in it for the story, or Christ himself if you wish to see it that way. What we see in Hollywood are usually movies which tend to use violence and brutal-imagery for entertainment purposes and those who think they can use violence as a tool to make their project seem realistic. ""The Passion of the Christ"" fits into neither one of these categories. Yes it contains scenes that are brutal, violent, painful and quite possibly insulting beyond recognition but it uses it to show us the enormous suffering of a man and wishes to show us the raw and pure pain and reality of it out of sympathy for this 'sacrifice', whether or not a justified sacrifice.One thing that makes this movie, if you like it or not, stand completely out of the crowd is that it uses authentic languages! Both ancient Hebrew and Latin are represented and used non-stop throughout the movie... I truly support this great innitiative! The movie features the last hours/days of Christ and thus skipping large - virtually all - portions of the Bible, we could of course get our jackhammer out of the closet and completely crush the concept and the movie itself for this, but it is the artistic freedom of the director to do so. The movie tends to show us the most important parts via 'flashbacks' throughout the movie, usually represented is if it were the thoughts and memories of Christ himself. It may not contain every detail as represented in the Bible itself, nor may be it all be perfectly correct, none the less it contains all information necessary to make the movie understandable.The camera-work of the movie is amazing, as well as locations and costumes... add to this the 'authentic' use of Hebrew and Latin and a truly absorbing atmosphere is created. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a movie worth seeing for anyone who has an interest in Christianity, religion, history and cinematography. Go out there and watch this movie but do not expect to 'ease down' on using your brains or viewing a friendly and peacefull Christian-movie. Expect to be dragged along into a whirlpool of passion, anger and much more.I rate this movie very high for adults, at least those who have an interest and a good IQ ;>) I wouldn't rate this high, NOR recommend it for younger audiences, since its to graphically violent and probably boring to them.Marnix Salomons",The Passion of the Christ
924,tequila_mockingbird,Moving and horrifying,9,9 September 2004,"This movie was excellent. There's no point in the film that lacks in anything. Every detail was thought out and it put some serious thoughts into my mind, as to I don't know anyone who would go through this torture if they didn't have to and could use their power and glory to wreak retribution on those that beat him so badly. I like how it didn't paint a pretty picture of Christ's death. As if it could be so easy to be crucified. Well, if not easy, at least something that others might die for.I really entered the feeling of this film, being drawn in my the music and the emotional outcry it's message was trying to project.

As a trained historian I am impressed. Most of all as a Christian I am moved. A truly remarkable piece of art. I say it twice in theater and have since bought and viewed the DVD. It gets better with each viewing, like a all great art should. Easily the best film of 2004 and possibly the best religious film I've ever seen. This is film is not anti-anyone except sin.

927,petercrooks24,"not to give a spoiler, but in the end...",4,24 February 2005,"This was one of the all time most disappointing films. It was fairly effective as a creepy supernatural horror film, what with the floating androgynous Satan holding a baby George Bush, but the spiritual meditation was almost nonexistent. Gibson's Christ had zero humanity...the audience feels badly that anyone is being tortured, but the flat as a pancake flashback sequences and relentless sadistic violence provide zero context whatsoever.The movie is beautifully photographed however. Too bad is suffers from such heavy overkill on the sadism and offers so little reflection on Christ's sacrifice.",The Passion of the Christ
928,YakuzaElite1980,One of the most prolific movies I have ever seen!,9,16 May 2006,"I hate Mel Gibson. As an actor I never really liked him. But as a director I was really shocked to see how well this movie was made. The movie itself chronicles the last days of Jesus before he is crucified. And boy, does it ever. As a film perspective, its beautiful. Very violent and gory, the images that capture us and draw us in into a violent world. The scourging scene will stand as one of the most brutal scenes in cinema history. Just watch it for yourself and I dare anyone not to be shocked by it . Its that powerful of a scene. But in the end, its James Caviezel who steals the show with his portrayal of Jesus as very frighteningly real. But do yourself a favor and pick the movie up if you haven't seen it yet. Even if you are not Christian, you will enjoy the movie for sure. Trust me, its not just a movie, but a sort of revelation about what one man had to go through for all people and their sins.",The Passion of the Christ

The Movie, what I didn't like about it. 
If the Movie is worth watching, if it's worth watching 
More than once and if it's worth buying. 
----------------When I heard Mel Gibson was going to Direct I was intrigued!as I for one think he is a great Director. 
When I went to go see it I had already heard it was really good, but nothing could have prepared me for this! I have seen many Different versions of Jesus Movies 
But this one was Beyond Epic! 
If you see The Passion of the Christ the Defenite edition DVD it takes you in deep into the Movie with ours of Behind the scenes footage and you will see that it was not just an ordinary Movie for everyone envolved, they all poured there hearts out into this Project and it turned out wonderfuly! I highly recommend it for everyone, it specifies clearly and in detail what Jesus had to go through in those Moments! A faith filled movie, but strong gory content. Likes: Everything it's great from start to finish! 
Dislike: Nothing Recommendations:
. Yes it's definitely worth watching 
. Yes it's worth watching more than once

931,twk00,The Last Killing of Jesus,5,5 October 2005,"From a purely cinematic standpoint the Passion can be admired for its audacity (the script is partly Aramaic, a dead language), its cinematography (well done) and its acting (a fine performance by Jim Caviezel). This is a film made by a Christian, for Christians, and its power comes from whether or not you believe in that sort of thing. One thing that did come to mind for me was Jesus THE SUPERHERO and BRAVEHEART. Mel Gibson has a thing for torture. This movie made a fortune....hmmmm profiting from Jesus? This was also a horror film. Those evil kids tormenting Judas were the stuff of nightmares. And Satan was a little androgynous don't ya think? Well I'm off to watch 2001, a much better religious film made for everyone, not just Christians.",The Passion of the Christ
932,timknight295,this film is weak,2,24 February 2006,"I only clicked the contains spoiler bit because I'm revealing that at the end of the film Jesus get crucified. I wonder how many people watched this film not knowing about that, not many.Anyway this film is weak. I went to see it thinking I was going to see a beautiful, exhilarating piece of Christian art. I think that is what the film is trying to be and what mel Gibson wanted it to be but it sure does fail dismally. It's attempts to be authentic are undermined by two major problems. 1- Jesus wouldn't have spoken Aramaic he would have spoken Greek. 2- when he is crucified they put the nails through his hands. No one ever got nailed up by their hands their hands would have just ripped clean off, you can only crucify someone through their wrists. I think Gibson probably knew this but thought most audience members would have thought that he was making a mistake if they saw the nails going through the wrists instead of the hands so he decided to go along with a common misconception rather than risk letting his audience think he was making a mistake. Some authenticity.Why does Jesus still have holes in his hands when he resurrects? This just seems like an excuse to use a not particularly impressive special effect. Caviezel's performance is tedious and unengaging, he really doesn't seem to have a clue what he is doing in this film but that's probably the fault of Gibson's direction not him. The music is totally inappropriate it just makes the film feel like it's trying to be a big Hollywood blockbuster. If Gibson and this film aren't anti-semitic how come Gibson doesn't denounce his father's anti-semitic views and how come the film doesn't show the sign above Jesus's head on the cross that read 'king of the jews'? I'm not saying it is anti-semitic, but there's no evidence that it isn't.I think the idea of using authentic language and concentrating on the violence of Jesus's last few days is a great idea but this film really makes a mess of it.",The Passion of the Christ

Mel Gibson is an artist; as a director you are an artist using film as your media. Artists tell a story, not ""the"" story. Gibson gave us an interpretation of the ""passion""; just as Michaelangelo did, just as DA Vinchi did, just as Scorsese did. it was visually stunning, an emotional journey stirring the soul; which is the point of any piece of art, to capture you visually and stimulate you emotionally and spiritually. Since this is Mel's 2nd film i can not say his masterpiece; i hope he outdoes himself in his projects to come, but in my mind a masterpiece of film media. to quote one of Mel's other movies, ""everyone dies, but not everyone truly lives"", and as Yeshua, says in this movie, ""see mother, i make things anew"" this story is about the death of a man, Jesus, one of histories most important figures, if not the most important; he truly lived and he made the world anew.

(No other passion move has done that).The special effects are awesome, yet realistic (an important factor in all realistic Jesus movies) The acting is done splendidly; one stops thinking about Mel Gibson during the movie and thinks of Palestine at the turn of the AD era(with Aramaic-Latin as the main Lang.).Albeit long, it is worth every second of it; because compared to other passion movies, they place the crucifixion to last 5-10 min tops.In addition, the original languages add the touch of originality to the movie.In short, This move is to be seen by every person, Christian or not; after all, it is (or at least needs to be) a classic.",The Passion of the Christ

I've seen many movies about Jesus Christ but none of them impressed me like this one. It's not about Jesus life, it's not about his passion or about what he suffered for us. The message that came to me, the things I've understood are different. This movie speaks about ourselves as human beings. Christians or non Christians... we are humans, doing sins, doing good things, carrying our cross on our own Golgota. It's about what we choose and the way we choose to live. We can choose to LOVE or we can choose ignorance. Was this movie violent? YES. But its violence don't consist in the blood that we've seen in the movie, its about the naked Truth, in OUR FACE, about us. Humans. The pain that a body can carry on is far more easy that the pain of the soul. WE can heal our bodies, but if we turn our faces from love...who will cure the heavy pain of the souls? You need to know the New Testament in order to understand the symbols, but it needs soul to feel. It's a movie for us.",The Passion of the Christ

Don't get me wrong but this movie is a story for more than just Christians. It's for every race, religion and nationality. Mel Gibson really did make a masterpiece out of Christ's death. But it isn't for the weak-minded, it isn't something i'd bring my kid to see, Not just for the blood and guts, but for the glee that is on the face of the Romans as they completely mutilate Jesus' body. This movie is also kinda scary as well, especially when Satan appears to Christ at the start. Where he tempts Him, and sets a serpent on Him. There are very few movies that can effect me emotionally the way The Passion Of The Christ did. I'm far from religious, but this movie really taught me to honour Christ in some way.

The brutality in this movie, while excessive, is necessary for it to be historically accurate. It was a violent depiction of a violent time. Now that I have that out of the way, the performances are amazing. Jim Caviezel's performance is impeccable as he depicts Jesus's reluctance, and determination to see Isaiah's prophecy through. Maia Morgenstern portrays Mary perfectly. She realizes that this was what Jesus was born to do, but she is still reluctant to let her son go. She portrays the pain Mary felt amazingly. I'd definitely recommend this film, but I repeat, DO NOT SHOW THIS TO A YOUNG AUDIENCE. This film will easily disturb children due to its bloody violence and demonic imagery. If you choose to show your child a film about Jesus, show them Jesus of Nazareth. However this is a very well made film and I recommend it to MATURE audiences...",The Passion of the Christ
940,rwgrider,An experience that will be one of a kind...and never forgotten...,10,26 March 2006,"Mel Gibson set out to do one thing...and that was to portray the Passion of Jesus Christ in such a way that each person sitting in the theatre...seeing the images on the screen...would feel it in their heart and know what this man did...for us. Contrary to other posts...this movie is NOT about anti-semitism, it is NOT about humanity, violence and the evil in our world. While violence and evil were present at Christ's crucifixion, that is not the message of this film. It is simply a call to Christians, and all of mankind to realize and appreciate what Jesus went through in order to save us. Obviously this movie is not for everyone...the gore and violence are more thanany film I have ever seen. I guess the scary part is how realistic it all is. No guns or machettes or chain saws...just brutal beating of a helpless man. It is amazing what Mel has accomplished...I can't say it is the most accurate portrayal of the Passion, because well...none of us were there were we? But wow...I must say it is by far the most moving and cinematically spectacular movie about Christ. The arameic language was something I was a bit skeptical about going in...but after seeing it I would have never imagined how much more authentic and believable that would make it. It was definitely the right way to go. It's hard to find something wrong with this film...everything was done so elgantly and artistically...even Satan is believable...just amazing...by far the best movie that I will probably only watch once!",The Passion of the Christ
941,tom1978,"feel guilty already, you sinners!",2,24 July 2006,"A warning word ahead: yes, you might be offended by my following comments if you happen to be a Christian. So if you don't want to be offended, there's one simple solution: don't read any further. well, OK, i tagged this comment containing spoilers, so here we go: Jesus dies. So much about the plot of this movie. That sure doesn't sound like it could fill 127 minutes worth of film reel, but if you manage to add just enough blood, whipping, beating, blatant sadism, torn up flesh and...well...a bit more blood still, it works out. Actually i believe there's so much blood in this movie, you would probably have to drain at least 3 skinny men to get to the amount Jesus is managing to bleed in this film.Now why on earth did Mel Gibson choose to depict the most defining part of Christian mythology as a state-of-the-art splatter film? The reason is to me pretty obvious: the viewer should feel guilty, very guilty. Afterall, if Jesus didn't ""die on the cross for our sins"", as the writers of the bible wanted us to believe, he'd be just one of the many magic-tricks performing, sweet talking ""messiases"" the world has seen for thousands of years.Now to make things clear, i don't think there's anything wrong with believing in the story Jesus died for your sins (remembering that guilt i.e. the concept of ""sins"" is a strong (and obviously convincing) element in so many religions), but when guilt becomes the very central element of your reasons to follow a certain religion, you're not only bound to lead an unhappy life (which is none of my business actually), you also are more likely to be willing to impose your believes on other people, since you might ""owe"" it to your god to save as many souls as possible (which then effects me too).Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" therefor stands out for me among the many films about Jesus and other religious figures as the most obviously manipulating of all of them. There's only one single point made by this movie, and that's: ""look how this fellow suffered....for you! Now dammit make up for it!"". The tool which Mr.Gibson uses to bring across his point is not the often in the comments here seen ""historic accuracy"" (which is kind of an oxymoron anyways ...we're talking about the gospel, or put in other words: mythology), its straight out ""shock and awe"" to the extreme - kind of a bastard son of attention grabbing and good old emotional manipulation. in closing, the 2 points I gave this movie go directly to the special effects crew.",The Passion of the Christ

I cannot believe anybody would ever sink this low for the glorification of organised religion.This sort of thing is completely uncalled for as even more delicate and more emotive subjects have been dealt with in more tasteful ways. Using this sort of violence to glorify something that has already caused as much pain and suffering in the world is completely pointless and if it was not created for shock value only I would be very surprised.Our world does not need this sort of sensationalism and whipping up of people's religious passions. Mr Gibson should be ashamed of himself for making this sort of self serving, shock inducing, sensationalist film. It may have been made in an artistic manner and is very much not without artistic merit but the film is completely ruined as is a very poignant story by the completely overboard violence and horror of the way it is portrait.As a comment about religion, for the first time ever I may find myself agreeing with some religious circles and saying that I find this piece entirely without merit.",The Passion of the Christ
944,Dave-in-Hayward,It is as it was...,10,3 March 2004,"While Mel takes some artistic license in his version of this ancient story, the basic thrust of the narrative is extremely accurate to the Biblical text both in detail and in, I believe, import of the original writers of the Gospel stories.I will concede that I count myself among the faithful and that I understand with the same mind and heart that which Mel Gibson (and billions of otherChristians) understand and believe regarding the significance and meaning ofthis event.  So my view, some would say, is biased.  But I equally believe that those who deride and malign this film are equally biased in the reverse  if they were to be intellectually honest.The violence is not integrated into this movie for the perverted pleasure of those who like violent films.  If that were the case, the millions of Christians who have lined up to see this film wouldn't have given it the time of day.  More likely, they probably would have protested it.  The violence is played out in great detail for ONLY one reason.  And that is to show us what it was REALLY like for Jesus to die such a death.  Anyone whothinks we who believe, enjoy this kind of violence is seriously mistaken. It only serves to demonstrate to us what we believe scripture tells us that our Godreally suffered.Some reading this may think that violence never happened or didn't happen soseverely.  And you are free to think that way if you wish.  But don't be so silly as to think we enjoy this tale of violence.  We only appreciate our Savior morebecause of it.  But we wince with every whip lash.",The Passion of the Christ
945,ichthus,Foolishness or Power?,10,18 March 2004,"Incredible film. very graphic. Someone once wrote, ""For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.""As I read through the comments on the film, I am amazed at how true the apostle Paul's words are even centeries later.  Is this film the whole gospel? No!  It's not ""The Teachings of the Christ"", it's not ""The Miracles of the Christ"", it's not ""The Resurrection of the Christ"" and it's not ""The Life and Times of the Christ"". It is merely and simply ""the Passion"" (in modern vernacular, the suffering"".) 
The times were quite brutal.  A few years ago, the brutality of ""Gladiator"" was being hailed as realistic and true to the time. The Roman world was a bloody sadistic world where a certain degree of pleasure was found in seeing otheres brutalized.  Seeing slaves massacred by Gladiators and watching defenseless people helplessly fight off starved lions or bears to their death was entertainment in the time. Crucifixion was used by the Romans for a reason - it was hideously cruel. That was the world into which Jesus came and died. Mel's movie captures that with incredible reality. Irrespective of whether one believes or not in Jesus as the Christ, the film captures the history of the time.Mel's Catholic influences are prevalent.  The Latin spoken in the movie more likely would have been Koine Greek, more likely the common language of the day.  The original texts of the Gospels were translated into Latin some centuries after the events.The flashback scene of ""the woman caught in adultery"" has Magdelena as the adulterer.  This is a common assertion which has no foundation is scripture and in fact is highly unlikely.Nonetheless, the film is a masterpiece of cinematography!  Maia Morgenstern is genius as Mary mother of Jesus and Jim Caviezel is excellent as the suffering Jesus.A hard ""R"" is appropriate to the movie and the story as told in the gospels.",The Passion of the Christ

Fear and violence are not at the heart of the Christian faith - love and hope are. This film is about neither of these. It is not about redemption, it is about fear and hate. By focusing on only the last 12 hours of Christ's life, and the way in which it does this, it distorts the true meaning of his life and message.",The Passion of the Christ
947,amelia-8,Go See this movie for yourself!!,10,25 February 2004,"About an hour ago I experienced a showing of The Passion of The Christ at a movie theater in Plano, Texas. You've probably already heard a lot and maybe read some about this film. As with any movie, I always say see it for yourself before you decide. After having seen this movie, I say that no matter what you think or feel right now, See It! You owe it to yourself to see the truth for yourself. Don't just listen to what people say but go see it.I am honestly so overwhelmed I don't know where to start. It is violent - it is realistic and hard to watch, but there is so much in that film that the media and the opponents to the film will not tell you about. This movie is all about LOVE. God's love for us. You will see scenes from the last supper, sermon on the mount, Jesus's everyday life and you will read (because it is subtitled) about his love for us, the reason he came to live and die for us. This film is Mel Gibson's interpretation but it is very Biblical. The truth is there - the whole truth - the beautiful and the ugly truth.You will see the beauty of Jesus and the beauty of his love for us. You will see the beauty of a mother's love for her son and her God, friends who love Jesus and stand by his side. You will also see the beauty of Satan who is present in this film as he is present in our everyday lives. There are scenes when he smiles and looks longly at you - tempting Jesus, tempting you.You see the beauty of this world and the people who want to be kind to Jesus. You can see it in their eyes that they understand who Jesus is and they love him.You will also see the true ugliness of this world. The blood will catch your attention, but it is the angry crowd, the frightened disciples running away, the Roman's who beat him and laugh, and the Jewish leaders who judge, the mocking/jeering faces that may have the deeper effect. I see myself in that crowd and know that I have hurt Jesus so many times with my sin. I watch the people laugh and beat Jesus and know that those are the people of today who say his isn't real, who call him just a good teacher, who turn their backs and walk away. The ugliness will make you sad - it made me weep.But time and again, Jesus will stand in this film and take the abuse, acknowledge his love for us all, no matter how we act or respond and move on toward the cross. His purpose is clear. What Jesus did on the cross is not a sweet story on Sunday morning with Easter eggs waiting at home. Jesus was hurt, beaten, nailed to a cross, tempted by Satan, laughed at and mocked but he endured it for you and for me. He did it to save us from our sin, to give us access to God and to destroy the temple worship that held us in bondage. The movie makes the clear point that Jesus could have said no, could have stopped the crucifixion, could have called on the angels - but he chose to go through every moment because of his love for us. As violent and hard to watch as those scenes are, just remember this is a 2 hour movie about the last 12 hours of Jesus's life - we just scratch the surface of what Jesus suffered for us.There is no ant-semitism. This is not about the guy sitting next to you. This is about you and the love of Jesus for you. If you watch the film and read the dialog, you will understand what this film is really about and really trying to tell us. The message is clear. The question is what will you do with it.The film itself is very well made. The filming/acting/makeup/effects/story/dialog all are excellent. Mel Gibson has done an excellent job. There are subtitles but they are easy to follow and don't move too quickly. I think the film is better for not being in english. You really feel like you are experiencing a more accurate account. The film will stay with you after you leave.One thing has stuck in my head, sums this experience up for me - I think Mel Gibson captured it beautifully. I am reminded of the lyrics of an Andrew Peterson song -- `The curtain tore and the Saints awoke and the whole earth seemed to tremble, with the fury of God's anger...or was it the fury of his love.""

948,Crazed Viking,Close - But Just Missed the Mark,10,25 February 2004,"Overall, I rated this movie a 7+.  Yes, there was violence and gore, but given the subject matter, about what I would have expected - maybe my imagination is more graphic than the movie.As far as the storyline, it was very accurate in the details given by the gospels. I did feel that the scenes of the scourging were too long and that the actual cruxification was too short - that is where the majority of the ""passion"" or suffering occurred. I did not see any anti_Semitic content - if anything, the Romans come off as the villans in this one.The costuming and location scenes were wonderful as were the acting talents of all.  I especially enjoyed Pontius Pilot and Mary. All of the actors did a fantastic job in conveying the message with their facial expressions since they could not with their voice.Is this a life changing movie? Maybe for some, but for me it was a confirmation of the sacrifice.  I hope that Mel will do a sequel on the story of Easter and maybe make it a trilogy with the Ascension and Pentecost.This is definately not for everyone and kids should NOT see this film.",The Passion of the Christ
949,DJ Boobs,Violence with nothing else...,3,29 February 2004,"This film is close to what I'd describe as rubbish. After a pretty good first 20 minutes or so, the film descends into non-stop violence - the sort that you'd change the channel or fast forward through if you weren't in a cinema.The film goes from a shot of Jesus being beaten, to a shot of the two Mary's and John looking on (but saying nothing), back to Jesus being beaten... Mary/Mary/John looking on.... you get the picture.There doesn't seem to be any character development - perhaps partly because most actors would have been speaking a foreign language. Diagalogue is limited, we have cardboard characters like Mary Magdalene and John - and a Peter that disappears early on in the film. There is no real insight into what Jesus was about - except for a few badly selected flashbacks...The feel I got from the film was that, he was a guy who clearly didn't deserve to get punished like he did, but did anyway...As the violence went on and on, I focussed my thoughts on my new girlfriend instead...",The Passion of the Christ

The suffering that Jesus Christ endured for the sins of mankind was powerfully depicted. For those who choose to debate the plot, remember that this is not a work of fiction. You can debate the acting performances, cinematography, soundtrack, etc until your pen runs dry. Why debate the truth? The events of history are not for us to critique, be it the story of Christ's crucifixion or the genocide carried out by Hitler or Stalin. They were what they were so allow yourself to be moved by them. If you like your history less violent, pick up the Bible and let your imagination and your heart take you there rather than Mel Gibson.",The Passion of the Christ
951,Kurt W,"Perhaps not violent enough, unfortunately",10,11 March 2004,"(Please note: my e-mail address is now kurtjwayne@yahoo.com...sorry to put this here but I can't find where to edit my e-mail.  Please delete the copy in these brackets...thanks in advance.)Two years ago, before most of the world had heard of this film, I read an interview of Jim Caviezel (the actor who played Jesus), wherein he said that the actual sufferings of Jesus were too horrific to be captured in a movie, and that this movie wouldn't be as graphic as events really were.Well...(SPOILERS AHEAD if one's not already aware of what Christ undergoes in this film...)Regarding the scourging, it's my understanding that in that time 2,000 years ago scourging by the whips used on Jesus were an automatic death sentence, as the victim would die within days due to infection.  I've read where lashings by this instruments would have been deep enough to cut arteries. Also, Psalm 22:17 (thought to be an Old Testament prediction of Christ's suffering) says: ""I can tell (or see) all my bones"".  Perhaps there were some which were visible besides the rib we saw in ""The passion of The Christ""?I wonder what public opinion would be if they knew that the Romans and/or gentiles in the Roman military would indeed have been responsible for the death of Christ within a couple of days?With the ""pre-crucifixion"" scene, a few verses earlier in Psalms it is written ""all my bones are out of joint"".  I was not aware that limbs were often dislocated while setting up for a crucifixion, as we seemed to see happen to the right arm of Christ.  However, scripture seems to indicate that more bones were also disjointed?As to crucifixion itself, there seems to be disagreement on how a victim would die.  A common belief seemed to be that a victim would die of asphyxiation.  Modern research (apparently using volunteers whose limbs were neither dislocated nor nailed) by a Canadian doctor seemed to prove otherwise.  However, I've read that if the arms were in a position above the victim's head asphyxiation would indeed take place.  Whether or not that's the case, there are several unpleasant things which take place during this method of execution.From all I've seen I get the feeling we're not seeing Christ's punishment as bad as it really was.Two other things:While Christ is in a courtyard (?) prior to his scourging he sees a dove in the air.  The Holy Spirit is said to alight like a dove...only through the Holy Spirit's help could He have taken the punishment.  In scripture I believe Christ alludes to that elsewhere.Also as to the ""blood and water"" pouring out from Christ's side.  I heard twenty years ago a sermon by Dr. Charles Swindoll, replete with medical detail, as to why this was significant.Obviously, these executioners had seen their share of dying and dead men. Apparently there are fluids that build up in the body, post-mortem, over a period of time (I seem to recall him saying that it takes hours, generally). What was so amazing to the centurion who speared Christ's side was that it happened within moments after His death rather than hours.This wasn't a documentary, but an artist's interpretation.It was still quite powerful, IMO.",The Passion of the Christ
952,Grant_Ritchie_superfan,Graphic portrayal of Christ's death. No meaning.,4,9 April 2004,"This film is brutal, violent and graphically so. Probably more so than any film I've ever seen. And I don't think it is gratuitous. Mel Gibson is obviously passionate about the subject and has made a film that, in his eyes, shows the incredible sacrifice that Christ made for mankind.However. It appears to me that when showing the brutality of man, he has completely ignored the reasons behind this sacrifice. Why doesn't Jesus say, ""enough already""? Is it because he is stubborn? Does he enjoy the attention? Hardly. But to watch this film with little prior knowledge of the story you could be forgiven for asking ""what does this mean?"".This film does not answer any questions or delve into the reasons of the events taking place in the film. There is a brief appearance by Satan at the beginning of the film where he states that the sin of man is a heavy burden for one man to carry. That is all the explanation you will get with this film.The trailer for the film states that Jesus gave a message of love. Where was it? It wasn't in ""The Passion of the Christ"". We do not get any reason for his sacrifice. Nor any reason why this should affect us today. What am I to learn from this? Was the idea that I was so touched that I rejoin the Catholic Church? Was it simply to show that Jesus suffered? Was it to entertain?If the intentions were to educate or enlighten in any way then this film fails as far as I'm concerned. Gibson should have concentrated more on Jesus' message than on his brutal ""death"".",The Passion of the Christ
953,Mistress of the Dim,Don't believe the hype,3,25 February 2004,"This afternoon I saw a matinee of The Passion of the Christ.  I'm not a Christian, but I tried to go into the theatre with an open mind.  I was surprised that the auditorium was almost full, considering it was 3:30 on a Wednesday afternoon.  The audience was mostly made up of white people in their forties, fifties and sixties, although there were a few younger people there.I decided to see Mel's opus primarily because I was interested in observing people's reactions to it; I had read that many people who saw it were profoundly moved by the experience.As for the movie itself, it is fatally flawed in several ways.  Gibson uses far too much slow-motion throughout the film; judicious use of this technique can be effective, but overuse is just annoying.  He used a lot in Braveheart, and if you can believe it, he uses even more in The Passion.  It's as if he doesn't trust the story or the actors to be dramatic enough -- he feels he needs to rely on this cinematic technique to intensify the scenes.The acting can only be described as melodramatic and, for the most part, poor.  The actress playing Satan, however, is appropriately mysterious and sinister; Mary, Jesus' mother, is also well played.Is the movie anti-semitic?  I can see how some perceive it as such.  The Pharisees are depicted as angry, ruthless, blood-thirsty men who hate Jesus because he claims to be the Messiah.  The Romans, though, get far worse treatment in the film. They're ugly and terribly cruel -- monstrous, actually.But I understand why the Jews thought Jesus was a threat.  This was at a time when many men were claiming to be sons of God; false prophets were running rampant in Israel and gathering large followings of zealots.  These false prophets were perceived as threats to Judaism and to Roman authority.  The Pharisees in The Passion feel that Jesus is dangerous, so they bring him to the Romans for judgment.  Personally, I don't understand why some Christians blame the Jews for killing Jesus and therefore dislike them.  Jesus HAD to die to redeem our sins.  That was his destiny, his purpose.  If it weren't for the crucifixion, Christianity as we know it would not exist. Christians should thank the Jews and Romans for martyring Christ.The violence in the film is gratuitous and excessive.  At several points I wanted to leave the theatre.  I know why Gibson did this -- he wants the audience to really see how much Christ suffered in order to redeem our transgressions.  But the violence is not realistic.  Had Jesus actually gone through what is depicted in the film, he would have gone into shock, lost consciousness, and eventually died long before his crucifixion.At the end of the movie, most of the audience quietly rose form their seats and left. Some people stayed to watch the credits, as did I.  I looked around and noticed that many were wiping away tears.  One young woman was sobbing loudly and was being consoled by her friends.As I left, I wondered how many of these good Christians supported the death penalty, and how many of them would pay to see live, televised executions (according to a recent Gallup poll, almost 50% of Americans would like to see executions on TV). I wondered how many of these good Christians were actively trying to ease some of the suffering going on in the world today.And I wondered what good Christian Mel will do with the millions of dollars he makes from this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
954,johenshaw,2 hours of torture. Entertainment?!?,5,13 April 2004,"For those who are Christians I'm sure the film has a lot of deep meaning and undertones, but for someone who is not, I would not have chosen to go to the cinema and watch someone being tortured for 2 hours, since this is what the film is.The film starts in the garden of Gethsemane and carries on until the moment of Jesus ressurection, however it hardly lets up on the violence for more than a few minutes at a time, going through the capture, a beating scene which takes a good half hour of the film, the march of a bloody Jesus through the city to the place of crucifixion and more (I couldn't watch beyond this point but i'm told it got no better) There are a few moments of respite. Pontius Pilate gets a few minutes of film time to come to terms with his decisions and Mary appears in the croud, as a helpless bystander to her son's death. It is a powerful, dramatic and brave attempt by Mel Gibson, however after a while the brutality became too much and I had to give up watching it.It may have helped to start the film with Jesus' arrival in Jerusalem and the joy and happiness that everyone felt at the time. Contrasting this with the brutality of his betrayal and death, the message could surely have been put across with less blood and beating but the same amount of emotional impact.",The Passion of the Christ
955,todd gaines,First review from Germany: Important masterpiece! Thank you Mel Gibson!,10,18 March 2004,"We all came out very moved and quite after we saw this movie. It was very provocative and many people over here in Germany thought it is too bloody and violent. But what do those people think? I mean, when you lash a man, you won't see water coming down his body, you will see blood. Mel Gibson did the right thing to show it. It should remind us of what Jesus went through because of us. I don't think Mel Gibson would want more blood to get more moviegoers. He's a brilliant director and is the right man for this movie. Jim Caviezel is also very good.It is a masterpiece! Thank you Mel Gibson, you are a brave man!",The Passion of the Christ
956,todd gaines,First review from Germany: Important masterpiece! Thank you Mel Gibson!,10,21 March 2004,"This is a extremly good movie and very provocative also. Over here in Germany people were concerned about the blood, which in my opinion isn't too much. It is believable that it happened that way. When the movie was over, nobody said a word or did anything. They stayed qiuet!I have to point out that Jim Caviezel made a oscar worthy perfomance! So far it's the best movie of the year and will remain as one of the best of all time! It was a brave project and I can' understand some people don't see it the same way.It's a brilliant masterpiece! Well done Mel Gibson! God bless you!",The Passion of the Christ
957,littlepond,A movie unlike any other. An experience beyond words.,10,25 February 2004,"I have spent better than half a century as an avid movie fan. I have laughed out loud to Brooks and Reiner, been spellbound by Spielberg, Ephron and been choked up by Capra. Still, in all these years and with all the great movies I have seen, I have never been touched to deeply and completely as I was today as I experienced The Passion. I was so overwhelmed by emotion, I took several minutes after the movie ended to try to regain my composure before getting up from my seat. When I finally did get up and turned around, I found half the theatre still there with me.Some may say this movie is too violent. If they do, they missed the point. This movie does not gloss or exaggerate anything. It simply portrays the events as they unfolded over the last 12 hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life leading up to his crucifixion.His suffering is the central theme of the movie and you are brought into the moment as if you were there. It is uncomfortable, it is painful, it is emotionally wreching yet the extremes you will experience are the result of the empathy that comes to you from the powerful portrayal and not simply the violence.Still, despite the violence and the suffering, I came away with hope and deeply touched that his suffering was purposful. If you are a Christian or a Jew or an agnostic or athiest this is a movie worth seeing. It is a movie unlike any other you have ever seen and unlike any you will ever see again. This is a movie that powerfully shares with you a defining moment in the history of the world and a defining moment in the history of film making and it demonstrates to you the result of a man's commitment to his faith and his profession.Go see this movie!",The Passion of the Christ
958,CinemaDude,More gratuitously violent than the worst slasher film,1,17 January 2005,"I think most every critique I've heard pro and con about THE PASSION so far has been colored by ideological glasses. The Jewish contingent hated it because they perceived it as portraying the Jews in a bad light. I understand that, but I can find lots of titles that portray different groups not to their liking. My criticism -- the real objection to how the Jews were portrayed -- was that they were nothing but caricatures, the result of a terrible script and worse directing.This is the worst failing that can be leveled at any screenplay and any director, and it impugns the integrity of the film more than political overtones. This is the same criticism leveled at the portrayal of the Roman soldiers -- they are nothing caricatures. Can it be that not a single Roman had ANY trace of compassion or humanity? How stereotyped is that? And how totally unbelievable. If anything, the Italians should be even more insulted than the Jews about the portrayal of their country men. But then comes the gratuitous, unrelenting violence....it is abhorrent. I got it Mr. Gibson -- Christ was scourged. I got it in the first 3 min of the scourging; I got it after the next 15 minutes. To prolong those torture scenes was about the most viscous, unnecessary violence I have ever seen on a movie screen. I would have thought there would have been an outcry from every corner of the political and religious spectrum about that -- from the Jews, from the Christians and the especially from the Churches since all that violence was nothing more than using the suffering of Christ, whether you think he is the Lord or just a poor guy caught up in the politics of the day, he was a human being and to trade on that suffering to make a movie sensational, debases all of us. But I guess gratuitous violence is tolerable, even perfectly acceptable if it is enlisted to prove some religious ideology.The film teaches us nothing. Not about the man, not about his divinity, not about the underlying historical context in which he was sacrificed -- absolutely nothing. I think it is a loathsome film and I am ashamed that so-called religious people overlooked all that is wrong with it and praised it just because, whether consciously or unconsciously, they could use it as a kind of weapon against another religious group. It is despicable mix feeding on violence and religious sensibilities to make a buck....it is so crass that even Hollywood, much to its credit, turned it down. But I guess where there is a buck to be made, SOMEONE will grab it to make more, no matter how sleazy the project. The fact that it was made independently of Hollywood doesn't absolve it of its glaring, disgusting faults.",The Passion of the Christ
959,mcmlxxxviii,Powerful,10,28 February 2004,"I have to say that at some point in the movie I think I experienced just about every emotion known to man. It was extremely hard to watch in some places, in fact I had to look away a few times. Some parts are very graphic, but not to the degree as I was expecting. At times I just wanted it too end. But some parts are also profoundly beautiful and moving. But the difficult sections are well worth it, and the final scene makes it all make sense. It is intensely powerful, however I didn't even realize how much so until I left the theater.Is it anti-Semitic? True, the Sanhedrin are not portrayed in a positive light. Neither are the Romans. It follows the texts very closely on those issues. But all there are are Romans and Jews in that area at the time. The answer to who killed Jesus in this film is the same answer that every person who has read the bible should already know. The Romans did, the Sanhedrin did, and theologically speaking, we all did.But what is not mentioned much by the people wanted to fan controversy, is that every single hero and good person in the film, with the one exception of Pilate's wife (including, obviously the central character) is Jewish.I will say that the film would be confusing for anyone who is not familiar with the gospels. Since so many lines are said, and things done that are not explained by back story, many people will leave with questions.There has been some artistic license taken, but it never changes the story, it enhances it.Jesus was portrayed with perfect restraint and subtlety. The characters of Peter and Mary were done exceptionally well.A pretty fantastic film.",The Passion of the Christ

961,lucascometti-1,The worst film ever made,1,9 February 2007,"First off let me say this i went to a Christan school and i am a CATHOLIC and this film betray's everything i know and learned.Mel says this film is the story of Jesus's few hours. I just shake my head at this. As read what i am about to say next i can only say that what i write is what i learned at school. And yes i accept the possibility that it could be wrong.When i was at school i was involved in a play to do with the crucifixion of Jesus and i spent a lot time researching this project.for one Jesus spent the last week of his life making the very cross he was crucified on. NEVER once did i read anywhere that he was tortured in they way this film says he was. In fact i read somewhere that Pontius( i think that's how you spell it) was warned not to torture Jesus as he would pay the price.At one point in the film it shows a guard shoving the crown of thorns on Jesus's head and yet i learned and read somewhere that Jesus put the crown of thorns on his own head as an act of defiance.Also in the film it show Judas taking his own life. However i learned that he was found hanging by the legs from a tree and that is was unclear if he took is own life or was murdered.it was rumored that one of the apostles in an act of vengeance killed Judas. They just some of the many things Mel balls-ed up.This film is Blasphemous and degrading to all Catholics. Just for record my opinion on the crucifixion is this. Jesus allowed himself to be nailed to the cross to send a message and that message is that no man should suffer in that way as it is WRONG.Just a little tidbit. It was rumored but could never be proved, but i chose to believe it as it makes sense that Pontius was told that if he allowed Jesus to be crucified that something bad would happened to him.And it is rumored that after hear that Jesus's body was missing from the cave that Pontius became paranoid and finally crazy.Mel says that this film is based on his beliefs and stories his daddy told him. Well lol i think his daddy was not sober when he told Mel those stories and they same could be said for Mel when he made this awful, Blasphemous film Why Jim and the others would star in it is beyond me.",The Passion of the Christ

""I am heading toward birth and I just came from death!"" Think very carefully about this. He talks about death like it is birth and then he talks about gnashing of teeth. too.Jesus is the time passenger, except he was going the other way and that's what he came to warn us about on his way though our dimension. And Judas didn't like that because the letters in his name contain the word, ""sad,"" so he tried to get him and force us to remain on this direction through time. If Jesus succeeded, we'd all be going the other way, which is what church is for now.I claim that this is still by me, since I am writing this.",The Passion of the Christ

964,zaff_,Passion of the Gore,5,15 March 2004,"Wow.I have just seen the Passion of the Christ. And I can now say, what is all the fuss about? This movie was just gory, bloody, and yes, pretty pointless. The actors were all pretty good though, and the fact that they spook Aramaic, Latin & Hebrew was also good. But c'mon, how can people even say that this is Oscar material? I saw this movie 20 minutes ago, and I just remember three scenes:1.) a 20 minute long beating up Jesus scene. I got sick...and tired after 1 minute.2.) a 40 minute long (felt like that long at least) walking with the cross. YAWN!3.) a 30 minute long hanging on the cross, oh please show in slow-motion while bashing in the spikes in the hands.So that was basically it. I did not get moved by this movie at all, of course I felt sorry for jesus, but I always feel sorry for guys getting tortured.I felt disgusted the whole time, blood, blood and even more blood. Why so much of it? Talk about a over-use gore and blood. Does a movie get better the more blood it is? Not in this case it is. And back to what was the point with this movie? For me, an atheist, who does not even believe that this Jesus guy were all that special or a son of a god. For all crazy christians out there, I do totally understand why they're all praising this movie and giving out 10's here at IMDB. This is a movie that discuss a topic that they really burns for, but what about the majority of all other people who do not share the same religion as them? This movie is not for us then, eh?I had 100% more fun watching Lord of the Rings, also adapted from a book, like the bible. The stories in Lord of the Rings are much more exciting than the stories in the bible, but hey, that's another issue. Fiction as fiction.I would have more fun watching a movie about the French Revolution and showing all the heads rolling, with blood flying through the air...in slow-motion, over and over again. Or why not a movie about a guy who gets tortured for 3 days straight, with a purpose to show as much blood and gore and possible. (hey, that sounds like The Passion of The Christ)I just got really depressed watching this movie, there was no joy or anything in this movie, just dark dark dark (but sure, they adapted the story in the bible, no happiness there), so how come that alot of people find this movie sooooo good?Again, it's the christians out there who just loves the fact that a movie is about their favorite hobby and interest. This movie is of course rated R, even if I would consider it a snuff movie with all the unnecessary violence, but I have read several reviews on other sites by, yes, 11-13 year old kids. They went with their church-club. Sick! I wouldn't matter if Michael Moore made a pro-Christian movie, christians would still love it.No, if I want to want to see a movie about a guy named jesus, I'd much rather watch Life of Brian, that movie was good, this was just pathetic.Gave it a 5/10, deserves not more, nor less.Cheers,",The Passion of the Christ
965,guiltytomb,"Truly an amazing telling of the ""Passion of Christ"".",9,26 February 2004,"Although, I was raised as a Roman Catholic, I am one who is not of the practicing faith.  Furthermore, my personal beliefs have since changed to that of a more scientific nature.  Regardless of these personal ideas, or ""beliefs"", I was truly excited to watch this film.  I had made it a point to purchase tickets for opening day.Amongst the protesting and slanderous accusations that this film has received, I viewed it yesterday in New York.  The theater was packed. Most of the crowd seemed to be critics. Whether for an actual paper or in their own household, they all seemed to have a notebook out to document their viewing.  That, in it self, made for a very different film-going experience. But, putting all of this aside... (that includes the news reviews, the threat of slandering the Jewish faith and people, the protesting, and the critical attention)...I felt that I was watching one of the greatest films I had seen in a long time.The opening environment was quite dark.  There were no trailers and only complete silence when the film began to roll.  The darkened night,  only lit by the moon, and the eerie music let us know that this may be just what the critics were saying, ""complete with horror film effects"".  But, as the camera pans down onto Jesus(Caviezel)we know that we know this story and it all falls into place accordingly.  The feeling of his pain is there.  The story of the disciples is there.  It's all told in due time, in the proper film format.  Even with my lack of faith I can say that this film instills the greatest inspiration value within the viewer.  Although, the torment and grief that Jesus went through was depicted relentlessly, the point was not without purpose.  Gibson's depiction of this horrific journey was not so horrific when you watch the beaten and bloody Jesus endure this ""Sin of Man"" as he constantly has the ""Passion"" to forgive them for there sins.  The critics claim that the brutality is unrelenting because of Gibson's lack of ""softening the images by moving cuts of the torture scene"" yet, the story in itself is very ""relenting"" in the fact that Jesus would go through such a sacrifice for that of mankind. This film is a truly accurate interpretation of the last twelve hours of Jesus Christ's life, with respect to that of the tellings in the Bibles of the Catholic denominations.  The tale within has a vast amount of inspirational value and Gibson's film gives a one hundred and ten percent of this inspiration through his images.  Caviezel and fellow actors/actresses give an equal amount of energy and realism to the characters.  For someone who is without faith, I see this films as a masterpiece.  For those who find problems with the ""accuracy"" of the film, I'd have you know that what I saw on that screen was no different that what I was taught all my years of practicing the faith.  For that, I'd also add that I didn't walk out with any changed views to that of any other religious belief structure.

966,cheesaburger,Not an Anti-Semitic Movie,9,26 August 2006,"This movie was really good and very religiously inspiring. The brutality of some of the seems should not of been the focus of so many movie reviews because it was only secondary to the true message in the movie of love and what true love made a man do for all of mankind. It emphasised how much Jesus suffered for all of us. Beside this so many film critics and people who had problems with both Mel Gibson and the Catholic Church said this film was anti-semitic but i agree with Mel Gibson when he says that this film was just going along with what is said in the gospels and who accuses the gospels of being antisemetic? No one, because it isn't and had a message of forgiveness predominately in it as does the Passion of Christ - it does'nt leave out Jesus saying 'Father forgive them for they know not what they do' - Jesus forgave those responsible for his death and everyone - some Jews were responsible for his death as were some Romans and some future Catholics but we do not hold anything against the other Jews or of the time or those Jews andothers actually responsible or against any Jews now or any descendants of those who might've had a part in Jesus' death and those that claim to be Catholic and do are not Catholic truly.

967,habert,Definitely NOT for children or weak minded individuals!,5,25 February 2004,"I have no doubt that this film will help win souls over to Christianity. When my wife and I left the auditorium there was a circle of people praying with hands clasped, ringed around the hallway outside the auditorium exit. I was absorbed by what I had just seen and was sorting it out.  I did not want to get into a prayer group at that particular moment and we were blocked from being able to leave for a few moments.This film places classic images of the crucifixion into a modern colorful wide screen context with no holds barred and buckets and buckets of close-up, red, red blood.  Is that a good thing?  Is it a good film?  How do you interpret ""good film""?  The technique was good.  It was all well made. It invoked tears beyond measure.  How could it not?  When you love somebody so much, it's unbearable to see them suffer - especially this MUCH.  So I cried - we cried - the theater cried.  It was overwhelming.  How could it not be?Was the depiction of Christ's suffering and crucifixion too graphic, too bloody, too much?  I believe that it was.  I believe that the film numbs a normal viewer to their very core.  I believe that it will be used as an evangelical tool for that reason more than any other.  I believe that people will accept Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior in droves after seeing this film.  The extreme mind numbing nature of this film will leave some people vulnerable to suggestion.  Numbing the mind is, after all, a basic brainwashing technique.  And as for my personal experience after seeing this film, I definitely felt vulnerable and even a little threatened by the group blocking the exit - no matter what they were doing.

Mel Gibson had that specific purpose, and he succeeded.The film is a blockbuster; easy to understand and precise in what it shows, the evil appears in very literal ways and the pain that Jesus had to go through for us the same, explicit; this is basically the whole movie, the last twelve hours of Jesus.But the little that the film shows, it does it in an incredible way.You travel back in time to Jerusalem to find something surprising. Each character acts masterfully, and the film is smart in showing you the precise and necessary of each one, knowing that it is the most famous and repeated story of all history. The cinematography is beautiful, the languages they use are the originals, the art of this film just Wow, everything is glorious.The verisimilitude with the supposed reality achieved in this movie, is the best I've seen. Literally some frames from the movie look like paintings from ancient times. All the scenes that come after Jesus torture are fascinating; but the film fails to show part of the mystisism that makes the bible so fascinating, and is what gives a primordial meaning to this whole story. They tried it with Flashbacks, but instead they decided to place odd looking demons.The film achieved the purpose of making the viewer cringed in the most painful scenes, and then leaving him with an odd sensation about this famous story. I give it a 9/10
Excellent movie.",The Passion of the Christ
971,mrmoviefreak261,"Moving, Touching, A fine film by Mel Gibson",10,20 November 2006,"To me, this movie was a great achievement. Mel Gibson is at his most brutal and best film yet since ""Braveheart."" The cinematography was excellent, Jim Caveziel is superb portraying Jesus Christ and the scenes where he is suffering and praying. This movie is one of the best historical productions yet. Yes, there is brutal torture scenes that could make you close your eyes, but that graphic violence shows you how much Jesus suffered for us. Mel Gibson moves the hearts of people by showing this fantastic production. It is amazing and heartbreaking, and is a movie for everyone, (but you must be able to handle amazingly graphic sequences of torture), and I think that Mel Gibson did an excellent job being the director. See this movie!",The Passion of the Christ
972,beezdotcom,"Not a biography, ""just"" the ultimate Passion play",9,25 February 2004,"Many of the critics who have panned this movie seem unaware of the brutality of the original subject matter, and/or are unfamiliar with the very specific term ""The Passion"" as it pertains to the account of Christ's final hours.If you come to this film expecting a full biography of Jesus, you will have come with false expectations.  However, if you have never given much thought to the brutality of first-century executions, this film might give you a better perspective on what Jesus willingly endured.For those who think the bloodiness of the film goes far beyond what is written in the Gospels, consider this: One reviewer correctly pointed out that in the earliest days of the church, no graphic depiction of a crucifixion was necessary - everyone had witnessed their share.  In our antiseptic culture today, it is worth reminding everyone that such brutality really exist(ed)(s).",The Passion of the Christ
973,bigcity7,A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!,10,25 February 2004,"If you are on the fence about watching this film, let this review be the one that compels you to go and see this picture.  Mel Gibson has done an amazing job.  This is one of the finest films that I have ever watched.  Gibson was true to the time, and culture of Jesus' day.  The film is so visual that less than 10 minutes into the film you don't even realize that you are watching a film with two languages, and english sub-titles.Anyone who even thinks that this film is anti-semetic is just plain wrong. This film has NOTHING to do with, ""who killed Jesus.""  And anyone who would hate Jewish people because of this film is just an idiot.
The entire cast is wonderful.  Monica Belluci is an absolute beauty.  She is defintely a major star in the making.  James Caviezel as Jesus is Oscar worthy, without a doubt.If you want to see a film that you'll be talking about years from now, go and see,""The Passion of the Christ.""",The Passion of the Christ
974,soren19b,a magnificent achievement,10,28 February 2004,"There are so many things that could be said about this marvelous film. Sometimes even believers can be bored by the way biblical events have been portrayed on screen in the past, but in this case Mel Gibson has injected fresh life and artistic skill into the genre.  The cinematog- raphy is spectacular.  Gibson also portrays supernatural elements of the story with great power, but he does not overdo it and thus distract us from the basic message of the film. Concerning all the controversy there has been about the film, I do not see any evidence at all that it is anti-semitic.  By far the most reprehensible behavior shown is the sadistic brutality of some of the Roman guards. Another criticism of the movie has been that the point of Jesus' suffering is not made clear.  But the flashbacks that Gibson effectively employs, and the verse shown at the start of the film, disclose that Christ died as a sacrifice for our sins. A third criticism has been that the film does not highlight the Christian message of love.  But love was the whole reason for Christ enduring what the movie depicts. This is truly a landmark film and worthy careful consideration.",The Passion of the Christ
975,natoriousg,Little evening up to do,1,13 April 2009,"OK just for the record I do not think that this deserves a 1 out of 10, I would give it more like a 5, but there are SO MANY people who voted it 10/10 out of religious fervor instead of the actual quality of the film that 1 one star review is not enough to bring it to what it should be. I'm not disclosing my religious views, but am trying to be honest in terms of the film itself. It evokes emotion, which was the point of it in the first place, but if you're looking for something historically (and biblically for that matter) accurate then look elsewhere. It's a great movie to watch on Black Friday or Easter to get in the mood, but if you are looking for an overview of Christ's life then this is not the thing to watch. Historically speaking Jesus was very complex, but this film depicts him very one-dimensionally, which is too bad. It's sad to see that Jesus has become synonymous with violence and bloodshed, when it has little to do with his primary message. 1 Corinthians 15:33 Do not be misled: ""Bad company corrupts good character."" Picture Jesus in today's world, and practically all of the religious right would describe him as a girly, sissy man, but just because the religious right claims to be the 'way the truth and the life,' it doesn't mean that they are correct. I urge all of you to take an earnest look at Jesus' actual message instead of what is crammed down your throats by your peers.",The Passion of the Christ
976,svanloon1,Worthless,1,24 September 2004,"This movie was a worthless remake. What's the point of this movie? We get to see the 185 times that Christ is beaten, punched or whipped. Let alone the 7 or so time that Christ is spit on. Why need just see Jesus of Nazareth or another such movie. How is any of this movie in the bible?I grew up as a Catholic and went through the stations of the cross every year. This was rather a pale reflection of those experiences.What the heck was Mel Gibson thinking? I think he should have just stayed with the Three Stooges or Mad Max.How come a person like Mel Gibson gets delusions of grandeur that he can be a great director? He's great in Lethal Weapon, but the Patriot and Hamlet were among truly terrible films. Braveheart was good, but Man without a face was crappy.Amen.",The Passion of the Christ

Gibson's depiction of the Passion helped me to see Christ in a whole new way. The performances were great - I was particularly impressed with Pilate and Mary. I loved it - all Christians should see it. Non-Christian movie fans should see it simply to appreciate how Gibson pulls off a movie in Aramaic and Latin on such a controversial topic. Stunning.,The Passion of the Christ
978,Croweyes1121,Regarding The Criticisms,10,25 February 2004,"I have read nearly all the reviews that have been posted online as of today and I can't explain them to myself.  I truly and honestly believe that none of these detractors could possibly have seen the same film I did last night at an advanced screening.  There are basically only two complaints I've seen written: it's too violent or it's violence detracts from Jesus's message of love.  I could not disagree any more vehemently.  I saw this movie is a packed house with Christians and a few non-Christians (and those of no distinct religious affiliation such as myself).  This movie was staggeringly powerful.  I was floored by the intensity and power of the visuals.  I had braced myself all day to witness a truly brutal film, but it still made my eyes well up time and again.  But the thing is, we need this as a society. We are so desensitized in this country and in this time to seeing violence that we have forgotten what the vile nature of it really is.  Why is it that seeing someone's head chopped off in Kill Bill or The Last Samurai doesn't bother us, but seeing a man get a nail driven through his hand does? Because it's REAL.  It's personal.  It's up close.  We FEEL that pain, we don't just sit there and relish in it.  If that makes this an exploitation film, then what have we gotten USED to watching?  This movie made me ashamed.  Ashamed of what I had allowed myself to tolerate.  Allowed myself to get used to.  It made me remember what true pain and true violence was and it taught me more things about myself as a filmgoer (and even as a spiritual person) than ANY film ever has.  The violence is this movie's power.  Take that away, and you have a film about someone being crucified with no realism and no emotional impact.  And no attachment to the visceral harshness of what Christ endured for us all.  Which brings me to the second criticism.  How can ANYONE think this movie takes away from Christ's message of love and forgiveness?!  They have scenes of his torture intercut with his thoughts of earlier conversations in which he says ""love your enemies...if you only love those who love you, where is the reward in that?""  Then it's back to the crucifixion.  It's that juxtaposition of Jesus's philosophy of love with his suffering that SCREAMS his message to us.  The more violence is inflicted upon him, the clearer it becomes to us as an audience who could have willingly taken on that burden for us...who could have still loved those who condemned him to death even as they were inflicting that kind of pain on him?  If that isn't a testimony of love and forgiveness, but one of hate, I guess I missed the point.  But I KNOW I didn't.  The critics have. By the way, as for anti-semitism, I've heard many critics say, I don't think Mel Gibson is anti-semitic and I don't believe the film is anti-semitic, but I believe it could stir up anti-semitic sensibilities.  I have one question: who's fault is that?  Gibson's?  His film's?  NO.  This was a phenomenal experience and anyone who says the violence is overdone is missing the point.  Is this movie an endurance test for violence?  Yes it is.  BUT WHAT DO THESE PEOPLE THINK JESUS WENT THROUGH???  And we complain about it making us UNCOMFORTABLE.  I must say, that makes me sick, and it makes the film's message all the more relevant.  Jesus endured the pain of it, and we can't even endure the sight of it.  If we've let Christ move that far from our hearts, I suppose this movie couldn't have come at a better time.",The Passion of the Christ
979,mabdog2,Excellent depiction of Christ's last hours.,10,26 February 2004,"Although there are some minor inconsistencies with the Biblical account I think the overall depiction is excellent. What I mean by minor inconsistencies, for example, would include: The soldiers that came to get him at Gethsemane did not go backwards and fall to the ground, as described in the Gospel of John, the nails should have gone through the wrists, not the hands, you did not hear the Roman Centurion explain, ""truly this man is the Son of God"", he did not speak Latin, he spoke Greek and Aramaic, and in all likelihood he did not carry the entire cross, only the cross member. The brutality is horrible and justifies the ""R"" rating, however, I do not criticize Mr. Gibson for making it so brutal, as the event truly was that brutal. I hope this film grosses so much money that it convinces Hollywood that they need to take a serious look at the kind of films they are making, and that they are not reflecting the attitudes of society, but instead are trying to shape the attitudes of society, and thereby lead society into the gutter.",The Passion of the Christ
980,penno,Not at all what I was hoping for...,2,17 March 2004,"So brutal and too religious. While I don't have any trouble in believing in a creator, I do have trouble believing in concepts like ""dying for our sins"", and the Devil, and miracles and whatnot. I think the Christ story is so much more powerful (and realistic) if he's not the son of God and is just a man. An amazing man obviously - but just a man nonetheless.SPOILER ALERTSo I was a little disappointed to find that this story is peppered with religious references. And that ""Devil"" character popping up all the way through it.... I found that strange. Having the devil tagging alongside Jesus as he dragged the cross all that way... Well it wouldn't have been an easy thing AT ALL. But with the Devil riding shotgun all the way up - that would have convinced Jesus that it was all part of God's Plan and he really didn't have anything to worry about. Not in the long run.Mary too saying things like ""It has begun"". She obviously knew what was going on and that her son was going to be ""ok"" - in the long run. How much more dramatic (and in my opinion - realistic) would have the whole event been if had not been ""foretold"". And no one knew anything other than Jesus was being tortured and put to death - slowly - in front of his mother and people he knew.I give it half a star because of the scene where Mary rushed to Jesus, when he had dropped the cross due to pain and exhaustion, and said to him ""It's ok I'm here"". That was so beautiful.In summary. Very very violent and just too religious.penno",The Passion of the Christ
981,Kaarmah,Shouldn't be called a movie,4,13 May 2004,"You can't really expect a movie that follows one man for 12 hours to be any good and this one definitely wasn't. Sure it's not any ordinary man we're talking about but still unless you are a true follower of christianity this movie is not going to satisfy you.Basically it's a movie about a guy getting arrested, trialled and after that beaten until he gets crucified. It seems that Mel Gibson's intention with this movie was to move and shock the audience but torturing Jesus as much as possible just doesn't do the trick. The movie has no depth no story and there's really nothing original about it.The only positive thing in ""the passion"" is the acting which is quite good, especially Caviezel is very convincing in his role but unfortunately that's not enough to make this a good movie.4/10 stars for ""The Passion Of The Christ""",The Passion of the Christ

But it is not cheap senseless violence or brutality, it is part of the story and it is rather enlightening and revealing compared to the candy coated films of the past.That's not to say that this movie does not show the love and compassion of God as some of the detractors would like to have you believe.  It that the love is told in a very humanized and beautifully subtle manner that does not reek of typical cheap Hollywood melodrama.As for Anti-semitism, I did not detect any it is the story from the gosphels told the way it was.

With regard to the way the film was shot and edited, again I think Gibson did an excellent job.  He used some flashbacks which I thought were really effective.Surprisingly, I cried during this movie which doesn't happen that often. (Im a guy and the last time was Forrest Gump when I was 14).  It wasn't during a ""religous"" moment either.  It was at a point that simply showed the love of a mother. It was done so well that it had that effect on me.

Frankly, it was the best Satan I ever saw in a movie, even better then the one in Bergman's ""Seventh Seal"". Simple, not too exaggerated, neither male nor female, has some sort of strange charm but at the same time scary. I think the crucifixion sequence was way too long, especially the ""walking with the cross"" scene. After one point, it became really boring.Great cinematography by the way, some of the shots were quite reminiscent of religious oil paintings depicting scenes from the Bible. It was quite impressive.Of course, another impressive thing was the use of Aramaic and Latin languages. Finally an American filmmaker decided to make his characters speak the language of the time and setting of the film instead of making them speak American English!

990,harrythemax,"Powerful, Graphic, Accurate, but incomplete",8,15 March 2004,"This is the most graphic telling of the ""death"" of Christ I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of them. Visually amazing, emotionally deep, (maybe the deepest ever), and historically accurate. There were some cruel, unaware people involved in Christ's ""death"", and to be ""brave"" enough to portray what they did to the most innocent Man ever to walk the face of the earth, was commendable. I do not understand why anyone would criticize Mel for giving Hollywood a Hollywood Movie. History movies are a big thing right now, so the timing was right, and with all the research done, (from what I believe), it is an accurate description of the death of The Christ. Missing in the movie, was an ending, Christ walking down the road, and meeting old friends, and entering a room of mourners as a living Savior would have been much better, and a lot less confusing for those who do not know the story. Another problem is the least of the deciples was Judas, but he is portrayed the most, and that could cause people to believe that the deciples were more looser than winner (they were until they met Jesus). The strong hint of Catholicism has me wondering why some are upset that Mel made a ""Prodestant"" version of the film. Christ's relationship with his mother is more of a focus than his relationship with his Father, and his mother being able to sense his presence through a stone floor, as well as Jesus drawing strength from Mary was pure Catholicism, and actually I found the movie to be more Catholic than Prodestant. I commend Mel for trying to satisfy both without upsetting either, so booo to the Prodestants or Catholics or Jews or Romans, who do not give him credit for trying to create balance when clearly different beliefs exist, for him to bend only slightly to try to please all was a job well done. One thing was made very clear in the film, was that some of the closest people to Jesus, that were most against the cruel punishment he received were Jewish, and it was only a small segment of the Jewish leaders of the time that (in the cover of the night) seduced (with the help of Lucifer) a small mob to rally against Jesus. Again, well done Mel, say ""Hello"" to Oscar (again).",The Passion of the Christ
991,Jphilip,It Delivers,10,26 February 2004,"What critics and skeptics fail to grasp about this movie is that there is no politically correct way to portray how the the Romans crucified their victims. Even if you don't believe in the veracity of the Gospels that this film follows so, well, passionately, it is valid to portray the events contained in them as a work of literature. There WAS a historical Jesus who WAS crucified by Pontius Pilate at the behest of the high priests and mob-scholars agree on that much.The Romans didn't attend the Geneva Convention. They didn't believe in lethal injection or life without parole. Moreover, the Romans who were in Judea at this time were brutal, sadistic, and hated being at that remote outpost of the Empire. It is entirely likely, even if you aren't a believer in the Christian Faith, that these events are devoid of overdramatization. There was brutality back then that we seldom see or experience in our society.As a Roman Catholic who attended a Catholic University and has some theological studies under my belt, I can say that the Passion is very loyal to the Gospels, and any artistic license taken at all is a natural way of filling in the gaps- witness Mary's flashback to Jesus falling as a young boy as she watches him fall beneath the weight of his cross. Or the amazed look of the soldier whom Jesus heals in the Garden after his ear is severed. Anyone would be stunned.All in all I was left with a reminder that he endured all that to redeeem me. That is the message of the Gospels, it is what I came away with from the movie, and all the surrounding hype about anti semitism was just that. Hype.
The message resonates, and the graphic nature, while severe, has far more impact than just reading about the events in the gospels. Seeing it portrayed in Gibson's movie compared with reading about it is like diving in the ocean as opposed to reading about water. It isn't for the squeamish but is a reminder to Christians of what Christ endured on our behalf. For non christians, maybe it lends some insight into the nature of our beliefs, and gives some disturbing background of the ancient Roman Empire.",The Passion of the Christ

Other than the whole being a Jew thing, the film was done well, good acting (I think, I don't speak Aramaic), the effects were awesome (great blood and gore) and the visuals were freaky as all hell.At times this film was the scariest movie I had ever seen.

993,fubertini,why impale this movie for its violence?,8,26 February 2004,"Frankly, I don't understand why most reviewers impale this movie for its violence.  Am I the only person who saw ""Kill Bill"" and was sickened by it? Didn't anyone else see ""Saving Private Ryan"" and cringe during the opening scenes of carnage?  I had to close my eyes many, many times during both of these movies.  Is it possible that Mr. Gibson is applying Hollywood's own current preoccupation with blood to his tale of Jesus' death? Is he simply injecting the same reality in ""...Passion..."" that has been so unrelentingly present in recent film fare?  He is, after all, a product of Hollywood himself, much as he might deplore that designation.I have great respect for this movie and for what I divine was Mr. Gibson's intention in making it.  For me, his way of telling the story is meant to demonstrate in earthly terms the lengths to which Jesus was willing to go to prove his love for mankind.  Grounded as we humans are in our physicality, we can be reached through identification with a person whose flesh is made to suffer for we share that same flesh, and our blood runs from its wounds, too.  Mr. Gibson's vision of Christ's last hours of agony invites us to extrapolate its spiritual motivation.  We do not have to accept that Jesus was the Son of God, nor do we need to practice any particular religion to embrace the message.  To be ""saved"", we must only believe in the transforming power of love.As with any other film, you take away from ""...Passion..."" what is filtered through your own consciousness.",The Passion of the Christ
994,adamjschellenberg,Fantastic,10,19 February 2004,"View from the Second Star: The Passion of the Christ (Adam watched this film at a special preview in January)It's hard to walk into a picture these days without knowing every detail about the movie. Trailers have shown too much story, reviews have jaded your perspective, or friends have refused to see it - movies get spoiled. Yet, sometimes, knowing the story is a far cry from seeing the event. For many, the story of the crucifixion is something they've grown up with, lived with, as far back as memory serves. I tell you this, no matter what you've heard, no matter what you know - you will be stunned by The Passion of the Christ.From the opening shot to the falling credits, this film demands full control of ones body and emotion. So visually spectacular and physically gripping, this film had me literally convulsing as I attempted to watch what was onscreen. Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, starring Jim Caviezel, is a retelling of the last hours of Jesus Christ. Believe me when I say that this production is more than a story, more than a movie; this film can only be described as an experience.This movie is fantastically brutal. From beginning to end, blood drenched flesh is smeared across the screen in a ghastly fashion. Gibson defends his incredibly graphic depiction by noting that the bible states Jesus was beaten beyond recognition. I assure you, beaten beyond recognition hardly describes soft tissue being torn to be the bone as blood drips into puddles on the ground. The violence shown in this movie is unlike other Hollywood violence - it's uncomfortably personal. The scenes are so believable, the violence so real, that the scenes appear to take place in your very presence; imagine before you a man being torn to bloody shreds; your helpless to do anything, you're a spectator - utterly horrific.As any appreciator of the finer things in film might see, The Passion of the Christ is artistic genius. Mel Gibson stated that his film follows the last 12 hours of Christ in accordance to the gospel, and although biblical scholars have confirmed this to be true, it is also true that a certain artistic license was taken to particular moments in the story. Nothing anti-biblical was added, but inside a sense deep meaning was inserted through symbols and actions not actually recorded in the gospels. This artistry serves to aid the story and engage the audience - artistically and culturally, expect nothing less that a film superbly crafted. Set your expectations high, this one can handle them.Unless you've been avoiding the media in recent months you've heard accusations of anti-Semitism against this movie: its going to rekindle a hate for Jews, its depicting the Jewish leaders of the day as monsters, and its showing that the Jews were solely responsible for the death of Jesus. I trust that once the movie is seen by the general public all of these statements will fade into the shadows; this movies greatest defense will be itself. It is true that the Jews were involved in the crucifixion of Christ, just as it's said in the bible for nearly two thousand years. Hearing this story doesn't swell up a hatred for the Jewish race, no more than watching Schindlers List makes one hate current day Germans. This film is going to be many things to many people - anti-Semitic is not one of them.
No matter your background, no matter your race, no matter your beliefs on the afterlife, this movie needs to be seen.

Whether or not you believe in Christianity is almost unimportant, the life of this man (who did live according to historical facts) and the level of forgiveness, compassion and submission he gave up in the last hours of his life can make the viewer a better person just watching it.  I have never been so moved and so full of hope as I have been watching this movie.  When I left the theater, I knew I had seen something miraculous, this is the story of a man (or Savior depending on your faith)who was brutualized, forsaken, and misunderstood, who had nothing but forgiveness and compassion for the world who abused him.

Religeous ideology has always been the main cause of war and inhumanity.Religion is a tool to obtain power or a tool to control the masses. It is so easy to use religion against large groups of people because you need little logical arguments to convince them of your power. Only emotions (fear mostly) of going to hell or imaginary things like that is already sufficient to someone impose power against another.The fascinating thing is that even ignorant people understand the simple theories of religion, contrary to other ideologies (economical or political ones). So you can reach all the population and have them follow you.The truth is that the universe always existed. By some bizzare flaw in the human brain, this concept is hard to acknowlage. Of course there is no life after death, but also, the human mind can't understand very well that concept, so we created ""imaginary stories"" to satisfy our primitive minds.Death = non-existence (remember before you were born? that's the same thing as death)Ok, I hope you understand the truth (but I don't think most of you can) since you were already hit so much by the psicological propaganda (since religious people are born they are bombarded with ideology) so it's very hard to let go..But as our friend Neo always said: Free your mind.",The Passion of the Christ
997,LINEKING,what we get for experiencing The Passion of the Christ,10,25 February 2004,"This film is what movie making is about. It draws us in from the outset. Though, just as in the movie Titanic, we know the outcome, Mel Gibson gives us nuances and detail that shine and illuminate. There is one clear crystalizing moment which, out of respect for the guidelines (besides, I wouldn't want to spoil anything) states things more masterfully then the greatest orator known to man. The following adds to my comments:Dear Mr. Gibson:Thank you, from the bottom of this 53 year old bible believers heart. Your rendition of the last 12 hours of the life of our L-rd lacks superlatives with which to describe. We could use the entirety of the Thesuarus and would still be begging for more. If there is a moment in this film which is stunning, there are a thousand. If there is a scene which is earth shattering, there are hundreds. If there was an interlude displaying the depth of emotions between those connected with Yeshua there were many. You gave scenes of the interaction between His mother Mary in childhood, young adulthood and constantly during His ordeal. You masterfully depicted scenes from the Passover supper and interjected them at times to take us, albeit briefly, from His agony. You gave us moments to reflect on how we, like Peter and Judas find it so easy to walk away. Yet you also showed us the depths of despair we sink into when we do. You gave us a film which demonstrates the reality of the cross and of the vitality of His life. You showed us that, as it should be with all of us exposed to His touch, that people who meet us should come away from the encounter better then when we were before. So it is with me as I experienced (as Paul Harvey put it) the Passion of the Christ.
Peter Stuchlik Portland, OregonA final note: If you are not interested in this subject matter, your viewpoint is respected. However let me say that this movie ought to be watched by those purely interested in film making. It is the ""TITANIC"" for this particular genre.",The Passion of the Christ
998,LINEKING,Giving us more than we deserve,10,26 February 2004,"In Judaism, there are two things which are important. The entire year is entwined around the principles of observe and remember. Yes we know the gospel account. The gospel writers give us the who, what, when. they leave us to fill in the how's and whys, and possibly what ifs.  Mel Gibson, in this version of the Passion, gives us detail and nuances which enlighten and illuminate shadings of the gospel accounts. Because we know the factual account we can be prepared for what Yeshua endured. Yet this movie goes beyond. Yet it also is not a ""RAMBOesque"" treatment, with excruciatingly gut-wrenching scenes which people might experience in a ""slasher"" film. We are given opportunities to catch our breath, as it were, with flashbacks at poignant moments during the course of events from the Garden to the Cross.

If Mel Gibson thinks the slow torture and killing of a man with nothing else of interest going on is good viewing then I hate to think what he intends next. I would have thought this was upsetting for Christians, plain boring for atheists & a case of 'let's avoid our Christian neighbours over Easter' for all Jewish families. I half feared this to be shown as a party political broadcast for the anti-Semitism party raking up religious fervour amongst Christians but I don't think it would be good enough.In short, go back to acting Mel you were decent at that.1 out of 10",The Passion of the Christ

You cannot give a ""0"" to a film that has the historical accuracy, decent acting, and excellent cinematography as The Passion has.  I surmise Mel Gibson will consider it a success if, overall, Christians embrace their religion more because of the movie and if others find Christ after having the experience.  Hopefully, he will make more Christian movies with the money he has made.  I found myself wishing there were more flashback scenes, but Mel did not want to take us away from the violence for too long.  That was the point - to show the extreme pain that Jesus endured, for us.

Jesus died for our sins weather or not you believe that is not the films concern what it dramatizes is that Jesus fully believed it and i think so does Mel Gibson. its this unflinching faith that drives the movie forward right through your heart and soul. graphic and disturbing in all the right places. it does not glorify the violence but makes you feel it and experiance it. its there and it is the main proponet of the film and the Christ story. in life violence surrounds the world all peoples and faiths and never has someone been so unjustly violated throughout history as Jesus was. who's to blame for the cruel death of Jesus? it is written and Jesus said for this end he came into the world. this was a victory not a defeat it was accomplished according to a plan of salvation the devil was fooled and three days later a glorified christ rises from death to everlasting life all the violence and blood washed away all things made new.in the film you will notice the theme that no one takes away christ's life.when he sees the cross he embraces it with love even amidst derisions he offers his body and blood (suggested in film) to a father he knows he has in heaven. the father accepts the sacrifice of his only son, sins are forgiven and man is made new through this pact made in heaven between God and Christ before he ever took on our human form. this is the belief Jesus has. this is the sacrifice that mel Gibson believes Jesus made. this conviction drives the film home for me. it is the bravest film ever made and truly a great motion picture. go experiance the passion of the christ. whos fault? you and me baby, thats who.",The Passion of the Christ

Especially during the flogging scenes and the march with the cross.)This is a good film for Christian and non-Christians.  But, I felt that this movie focused more on the torture and the death of Christ when we should be celebrating his life and resurection.

This was apparently done to redeem the world of it's sins (though how one mans suffering can redeem the world I do not know).What makes more sense to me is that I finally got to see a retro-active punishment for the man who started a world religion that has killed, tortured and mutilated millions whilst spreading the ""good news"" and ""truth"" across the globe and through the centuries. The ""truth"", which is an invention of man anyways (truth being the subjective filtering of experience). The brutalization of Christ is in essence the reason for me giving the movie a ten.""No-one comes to the Father except through me"" - I'm right, you're wrong, there is no other way. - the ancient version of ""You're either with us or against us"" and we all know where that leads, the dead piled in mounds and the whole world turned to Golgotha.Spreading the word Mel? or profiteering from your savior? - I wonder how that will go down in Heaven?Peace and Hope FatherCrow",The Passion of the Christ

It also very clearly shows that Jesus is dying for mankind, his life is in his own hands. That it is the will of God for this to happen.

1006,kc4953,Disarming Anti-Semitic Skepticism,10,11 March 2004,"""The Passion of the Christ"" is a powerful film, no doubt about it.  It is generally historically accurate, save a few artistic licenses taken by director Mel Gibson, and some ""filling-in of blanks"" with logic and storytelling techniques.  Whether or not the film is powerful, however, is not the controversy.  What's got everybody a'buzz is possible anti-semitic tones that come forth in Gibson's portrayal of the execution of Christianity's hero.  What do I think?  I think ""The Passion of the Christ"" is as anti-semitic as ""Gettysburg"" is anti-American.  The Civil War epic takes place on American soil and represents American characters.  While the film displays the brutality of war, viewing the film does not produce the idea that Americans are vicious, evil people.  Rather, it aims to unite present-day Americans with emotions and struggles of their predecessors. In the same way, ""The Passion"" is a story about a Jewish man in a Jewish culture, so logic would suggest that the characters, both protagonists and antagonists, will come largely from a Jewish population.  The goal of the film is not to convince anyone that Jews are violent, hateful people - it is rather to unite all humanity to the struggles and experiences of one of its most influential figures, Jesus.  But because the Jewish people have had a rough history, they are ultra sensitive to any story in which any Jews are represented as hateful or malcontented.As a Christian, I was deeply moved by the film.  But anti-semitic attitudes being caused by it are troublesome to me, for a couple reasons.  The first reason is that I don't think the film is anti-semitic.  The second reason is that as a Christian, I believe Jews have a special place in God's purpose. Indeed, they were his chosen race in the Old Testament (Exodus).  So any anti-semitic feeling brought about by this film are far from representative of Christian teaching, and, I believe, far from Gibson's heart, as well.
So, when you see this film, try to lay aside pre-conceived notions of anti-semitism, and let yourself be captured by a moving story that transcends racial boundaries and theological controversies.",The Passion of the Christ
1007,raadki86,Masterpiece,10,8 May 2004,"This Movie is one of the best and saddest ever. I don't understand those voters who say it was awful. This piece of work is fantastic. The real historical background, based on the Bible is finally visualized by one of the best actors and directors ever. Compliments on Mel Gibson!!!!! For those who think that Gibson's movie is anti-Semitic: You people did not understand the message. Jesus prays for his exectuers and he wants his father to forgive them their sins. The message IS NOT to hate jews (or Romans)!!!! It is just a reflection of the real historical events! ""If you only love the ones who love you, where is the reward?"" Jesus never thougt about hating, even in the hours of his torture he DID NOT hate the ones who made him suffer, because ""They don't know"". Those who begin to hate the jews after watching the movie did not get the message either and as Christians we should know that Jesus had the mission to spread love to all the people! Love, NOT hatred. As I watched the movie I saw (and heard) so many people crying in the cinema. Some of them cried throughout the whole second part of the movie (when the Romans start to torture him). And, yes the movie is brutal, but the truth is always brutal. People who think that there was too much blood or brutal scenes are closing their eyes for reality, what about those action or horrorflics that are brutal? Many of them are rated better than this movie and the people don't think there was too much blood in those movies. 7.4 is not the correct rating for this masterpiece. It is a 10.0!!!

1009,llewelynmoss80,Disgusting...,1,29 February 2004,"Any message in this movie was blurred by 2 agonizing hours of blood and gore.  In the Bible, it is said that before he is crucified, Jesus is ""taken down and flogged,"" which, 2000 years ago, consisted of 39 lashings.  In Mel Gibson's rendition, Jesus is ""flogged"" hundreds of times by whips with nails and spikes to the point where two of his rib bones were exposed and his blood was sprayed, spattered, and slung in a crimson circle of about 15 feet in diameter.Violence and gore is very prevalent in contemporary films, but none come close to the degree of the Passion.  If you think you won't be sickened by Passion because you have seen films like The Exorcist and Schindler's List, you are sorely mistaken.  Passion makes those movies look like Saturday morning cartoons.Unless you have no soul or feelings inside you at all, this movie should haunt you.

1010,c_dyan84,Raw Passion: Don't Get Lost in Translation,10,7 March 2004,"The opinions of the people who have seen both ""The Passion"" and ""Lost in Translation"" reflect each person's own interpretation of the very raw depictions of ""a story"": what they see in an actor's twitch of the mouth, the wide pans of cities and landscapes, and the meanings between the snippets of words that were loosely yet carefully stitched together into a script. There's a lot of filling-in-the-blanks involved...a lot of translation--literally and beyond--that makes these movies more than just each ""a"" movie. And, eclipsed only by the obvious passion put by the filmmakers and actors into the making of these two, is the controversial question of stereotyping. Is there or isn't there?--thankfully, there is no real answer. The filmmakers did not mean it that way, in any case.
Personally, I love both of these movies--in the same way, if not on the same level.Both of these movies give us a different view of humanity as we already know it. In Passion, one gets to see (if not empathasize with) the pain of Caviezel's Christ, and all those around him, just as people have seen (and may have empathized with) Murray's Bob. The only difference is, The Passion is a movie on something already (somewhat) familiar to us. It may be a good thing or a bad thing.My opinion? It's worth seeing, to say the least...if only to see what all that bloodshed may have been about when the real Passion happened 2000 years ago.",The Passion of the Christ

I found myself welling up with tears at some parts, especially the scourging scene, which seemed to go on forever. It is hard to imagine the suffering that Jesus Christ endured for our sins, but this is close.Some of the characters, like Simon of Cyrene, were fleshed out with dialog and actions that were not Scriptural, but logical. After all, St. John said, at the end of his Gospel, that if everything that Jesus did were written down, the whole world could not hold all the books that would have to be written. Similarly, not everyone in the story was written about fully in Sacred Scripture. Scenes were added after some of the visions of mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich, in order to make the story more realistic in its flow.While this opus is worthy of seeing and appreciating for its spiritual and artistic merits, I would not recommend that children under 16 see it, any more than I would recommend their witnessing an actual execution.

1013,nateb88,Necessary? I think so.,10,13 April 2004,"It seems that every time I mention this movie to a friend of mine (especially one that isn't familiar with the gospels), they ask me if I thought all the violence was even necessary.  My answer: I think it was. There have been too many films about Christ that seem to portray His flogging as sort of a ""roughing up"" before they nailed him to the cross so he could simply droop his head and slip into death.One huge criticism of this movie is that we need to focus on the life and teaching of Jesus, not his gruesome death.  To that, I give this reminder: without his passion, or suffering, his teachings mean absolutely nothing. In order to fulfill his claim that he was the Son of God and the only way to the Father, he had to pay the price for our sins.  This is what Mel Gibson is trying to convey: the price that had to be paid.Also, there was no point in this movie at which I caught any hint of anti-Semitism.  Yes, the Jewish priests are portrayed as ruthless and unyielding over the crucifixion of Jesus, but for every one of them, there are at least two other Jews pleading for Jesus' life.However, if someone ALREADY is an anti-Semite, there may be some ground for them in this movie, but only by distorting the facts.There are some things that you can always hear about, but sometimes you have to see them to fully comprehend them.  The Passion of Jesus is one of them. There is no way to prove that it happened exactly as shown in the film, but it surely struck me as more realistic than any other version I have ever seen.",The Passion of the Christ
1014,mystemo,A view from both sides of the fence,7,29 February 2004,"If there is something I must praise Mel Gibson for regarding The Passion of The Christ it is the amazing debate and discussion it has provoked before and after people have seen it. He has succeeded in creating a very discomforting experience for the viewer, creating essentially 2 hours of a man being beaten for his views and beliefs, caught up in a very tumultuous political and social environment. Conversely, however, I am worried that the focus on the violent/physical aspect of the story may have blindsided the intentions of Christ in his works. Think for a moment about someone viewing this film with no knowledge of Christ whatsoever. You can assume from the lead up that he is a man, connected to the world around him, causing no obvious harm. Suddenly, he is taken by force and soon enough the beatings begin until the close of the film. My point is that I do not believe there was enough empathy created, via the film, to sustain a long lasting belief in this man. Any reasonable person would plea for the soldiers to stop beating him, but the significance of these 12 hours of barbarity, I felt, was not present as it should be. As a showcase of Christ, I think this film has its pros and cons. The intensity of the pain and suffering that he endured is very clear - no questioning that at all - but I felt that the physical brutality overshadowed the significance of the events before and after the film. Gibson easily could have spent another half an hour identifying many of the characters and running down a brief history of Christ's work before introducing Judas's betrayal. In addition, the end of the film was very much masked in assumed knowledge of the resurrection - this section needed something more before ending. From a cinematic perspective, I cannot fault Gibson's portrayal - the screen was filled with very pervasive images of the environment, the people and, of course, Christ. The film in itself was only considered violent by people due to the ongoing repetitive punishment and the consistent and increasing blood content on Christ's body. People have a psychological association with the colour red - hence why in films such as Kill Bill Vol 1, Quentin Tarantino opted for Black and White to offset the effect it may have had on audiences. In Passion, I do believe the red was needed to create a sickening effect.So, should you see this film? People with a knowledge of the Bible will be able to visualise events before and after the film, therefore enjoying the film immensely. People who know less will feel neglected by the film, questioning many aspects of the film and its issues unanswered by the feature. No matter which side of the fence you reside in, this film has succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams in creating discussions about each and everyone's values and beliefs in this very divided society of ours. 7 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ

This movie was a horrific, yet accurate portrayal of the death of Jesus Christ. I can honestly say this is one of the most powerful films ever made, if not the most. This is embarrassing to admit, but I actually shed a tear during this movie. It was so disturbing, and brutal, and it really hit hard when I remembered that this actually happened. And to be quite honest, Mel Gibson delivered that message PERFECTLY.From a technical standpoint, it was superb. Jim Caviezel gives a heartwrenching performance, with very little dialogue. Just the look in his left eye says 1,000 words, and probably delivered alot better than any words would.  The cinematography in this move was impeccable, as was the directing. It would be a shame if this movie is forgotten come oscar time, because this movie at least deserves its nominations. As a film maker, I really appreciate movies like this. Films like this make me want to continue doing what I'm doing, because of the message you can deliver. Mel Gibson deserves a huge pat on the back from the film industry.

I believe that God exists that he died to save me and rose again.  I also believe I was unworthy of such a gift.  If I die and I'm right then I get to go the heaven.  If I'm wrong then I've lived my life standing up for something I believe in. Either way I win.  You don't have to agree with that although I admit I wish you would, but even if you don't there's no reason to be hateful to those of us who do. 
You say The Passion is too violent but there are countless other movies out there just as bad and worse.

He went in front of us to show us the way, and He showed how to forgive people in the most difficult of circumstances.  I want to watch this movie a few more times to internalize more of His ""personality"" and to be able to follow Him more closely.  He stayed true to His belief to the bitter end. He knew it would mean a painful death and He didn't try to talk himself out of it, didn't lie because He was so afraid, and walked as tall as He could throughout the whole ordeal, never once regretting His decision to stand up for what He believed in.  Just notice how many martyrs were able to follow in His footsteps.  Also notice that He became the probably most influential person who ever lived.

Like one from whom men hide their faces He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.

That people don't leave the theater feeling indifferent is perhaps the strongest testament and best statement a person can make regarding this controversial film. Is the Passion anti-Semetic?  Possibly.  But the focus of the film isn't to make the viewer angry, but rather to stir the audience's emotion.  In that sense this film is certainly effective.

Two things to note here though - Hitler and Co did not need a movie like this to murder 6 million Jews and two, if this movie had put Christians (among pagans, Wiccans, etc..) in a bad light, I'm guessing there really wouldn't be that much of a controversy. But with the history of Jewish persecution, I can see why some would be worried about this film.I felt it was a near accurate portrayals of the Bible's account of the crucifixion, as well as historically.I think Cavaziel did a marvelous job as Jesus, but Maia Morgensterns's portrayal of Mary and the gentleman who played Caiphus (can't remember his name) had me thinking ""Oscar Academy - take note!!""). Also, the Satan character was awesome. They made it dark, foreboding, and strangely seductive (not sexually) instead of some red devil with a pitchfork, lol.
I don't think this movie will cause a mass conversion to Christianity, but in my own personal circle, it has moved a couple to research Christianity a little more (and not just base it on the over-zealous fundamentalists) and has re-awoken spirituality in others.As for the violence...well, as a Christian, it was very hard to sit through. The first time I saw it, I was by myself and had prayed that I would be able to watch the entire movie without closing my eyes (just a personal thing - heck, if Christ suffered through all this, the least I could do was watch a fake account of it). The scourging scene was almost too much, but at the same time not enough. What p***ed me off to no end was that the second time I went to see it, children as young as 5 were in the theatre. To me, that's irresponsible, especially when your kid is screaming to get away or is completely shocked by what they see. Grown people were crying and a couple left the theatre in tears, so no, I don't think this movie is appropriate for children.Another thing about violence, I've seen worse in other movies, but the thing about this one is it concentrates 99% of the violence on one man. I think that's what makes it so strongly violent.From a movie standpoint:*awesome acting all around - from JC to the people in the streets, great visuals, sorry music score. *the use of subtitles and the three different languages was smart *movie is a bit confusing for those who have never heard the story of the Christ. Mel could have done a better job of explaining why Christ had to be ""shut down"" and a couple of the flashback scenes only confused some people even more. *I gave it an 8 of 10.****SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT****Did you see the worm go into its nose right before the serpent came out from under it? How about the cloven hoof?Ooo, one more thing - when Christ is gets up from praying in the garden, did you realize he was actually sweating blood and that his face was not just dirty??",The Passion of the Christ
1023,cyberscribe,The most over-rated film of the year,1,7 March 2005,"Mel Gibson surely managed to hit the financial jackpot with this film, merely by tapping straight into the recent groundswell of religious fundamentalism that seems to be the latest fad currently sweeping the US.As far as the movie itself goes, it's nothing more than another rehash of the same old story that we already know all too well, but with a particularly heavy emphasis on the blood and gore aspect of the ancient Roman practice of crucifixion. Apparently, the bloodier you make the story, the more likely it is that the fundamentalist target audience will revel in it.I found the film to be grindingly laborious and downright boring. Seeing it once was more than enough for me. Anybody that feels that they need to see this repeatedly has got to be either a sadist or a masochist, or both.If I had it to do over again I'd save my money or see something else. There is absolutely nothing new, unique or cinamatically brilliant here.",The Passion of the Christ

I don't believe in god and have no relationship with the person Jesus what so ever. I take this movie as just that, a movie. A fictional representation of an idea, a story. And as a movie it lacks story and character development, but, and this is a big but, it's visual power is incredible. It's a visual feast. Lushes to the eye (and also great music and sound) And seeing that cinema is the VISUAL art of expression, i must say that i was very impressed with this film. To think that Martin Riggs did this, Mad Max made this, William Wallace directed this, very nicely done.",The Passion of the Christ
1025,morbidnate,Nothing but flash,1,25 January 2005,"This film, lest not forget, offers nothing new to the world of cinema. It's a carbon copy of every shock horror film ever made with Jesus thrown into the mix instead of a deadbeat, monster, GI Joe or a whole host of other stereotyped stereotypes.Honestly, aside from the beautiful cinematography, this film has nothing to it. It's only the story of the last few hours Jesus lived. If you are a Christian, than you know the end. You know how and why it happened. This was just a chance to put all of the religious relics that exist in the world into motion.Aside from the story lacking, the only redeeming factor is that Jesus dies in the end. With Mel Gibson at the helm, I would have not been surprised to see Jesus jump off the cross and kill all the Romans with a high powered automatic weapon. I respect the man as an actor, but to know that his ""artistic vision"" doesn't do anything in the world of art, it's impossible to respect ""The Passion of the Christ."" Also, the fact that he single handedly brought the film to the world is not a surprising feat at all. Yes, studios refused to make the film. So he pumped 30 million of his own, hard-earned dollars into the production. 30 million from a stack that hardly felt a dent. On top of that, with the majority of the people who watched the film considering it a ""work of art"" being Christians, it earned nearly a billion dollars world wide. So much can be expected by a film that shows Jesus being tortured for two hours.In short, this film is not worth watching. It takes historical events and exploits them for a chance to see some horrifying dream come true. I believe the film trivializes the event of Jesus's death and dresses as a wolf in sheep's clothing to the viewer, feeding on ignorance for success. Do not watch this film. Or at least, don't invest any cash on it. Wait until it pops up on TBN.",The Passion of the Christ

1027,vze4kyts,No Plot,1,5 January 2005,There is not much of a narrative to this film. Instead you get too many scenes of gratuitous violence and suffering. I'm am not a religious person therefore my comments are solely based on the film as a film. Apparently the director was expecting the audience to have PR-knowledge of this story. I didn't. The film never helped me to understand why people believed this man to be the son of god. I never understood why he was eventually crucified other than the fact that he defied the laws of that time by declaring he was the son of god. I feel the director could not see the forest for the trees. Apparently he was too far into his understanding of religion to provide a narrative that was sufficient enough to enable the less versed to follow the story. I have seen other religious films that have better conveyed this story (King of Kings for example). I ma amazed that people actually paid to see this trash. I saw it for free and wanted my money back.,The Passion of the Christ

However, since this ""R"" rating could very easily be said to be ""R"" for R-ealistic, he wanted them to go.This show was not an easy one to watch.  Much like the movie, Saving Private Ryan, I was moved to the ""core of my being"" by this movie.  I had to agree with the senior pastor at my congregation when he stated that after it was over, he didn't want to talk to ANYONE else for awhile.  Although we didn't go to the show together, we both needed to spend time alone with God to really let everything sink in>  I was reminded just how ugly ""sin"" really is in the eyes of the Lord.I have told the gospel story over and over again.  I have graduated from a Bible College, spent time in ministry preaching and teaching.  Yet, being able to see such a realistic portrayal of the gospel story was hard for me to handle.  I was overwhelmed by Christ's silence and lack of retaliation against those who mocked him, beat him, and treated Him so poorly.The true nature of Christ seemed to be portrayed so clearly in this film. Even after being beaten and bloodied beyond recognition, the 'punishment' wasn't ""good enough"" for the crowd.  They STILL wanted him crucified, and Christ went along with it!!!WOW...  After being beaten, mocked, and humiliated to that degree, and the people still wanting to ""Crucify Him, Crucify Him!!!"".  All I have to say is it is a VERY good thing that it was Christ they wanted that from, and not me.  At that point, I'd have been likely to say, ""FINE, forget you!  I have had enough, and if you want MORE, get it yourself, or from someone else!!! I am THROUGH with you, you ungrateful, jerks!  Die in your sin, I can spend eternity without you!""BUT, the good news is:  it was HIM, and not me...  He wants us, He wants us all, He wants each and every person alive to spend eternity with Him!

If I had watched this when it released, I would have been sick for about 90% of the movie. Pornographic: the critics did not exaggerate when they described this film.Anyway, on to the review. I expected the film to have more power. I was disappointed. Most of the character-building was weak, and I found myself unmoved by most of it. The two most important scenes: the crucifixion of Christ and his subsequent resurrection had almost no impact.The prevalent feeling throughout was a slight stomach-churning (particularly when He was being whipped. Seriously, that Governor just made things worse by prolonging His suffering, that jerk).The positives: I liked certain scenes- when Mother Mary runs to her son (paired with the flashback), when the earthquake strikes. The portrayal of the Devil was also intriguing- and should've been explored further (I have my own theories about that).All in all, it was just bearable.

In this movies shows the cruelty and hypocrisy of humans and how we have become barbarous.Its not all about anti-Smuts, its all about the love of Christ for us.

1034,wjz10816,Jesus suffered all for love,8,12 April 2007,"I have been brought up for most of my life in the church, but didn't really understand what Jesus suffered until I watched this movie about a year ago because in the Bible it doesn't really explain what happened, just that he was flogged and crucified. I have watched it just recently a second time, with perhaps more understanding of the whole story. This movie is a really powerful movie, which sticks to pretty much what the four gospels say. I also don't think it is anti-Semetic because what happens in this movie is in the Bible. The thing I don't like about this movie is the use of Satan. I don't think it was necessary for Satan to be depicted at all. Also, the fact that Mary Magdalene was depicted as the unknown prostitute was something I disagreed with, because she is mentioned in the Bible as the woman who Jesus rid of demons. Sometimes this movie is painful to watch, not just as a Christian but as a person in general. To see an innocent man suffer so much pain and suffering and not feel something, would be wrong. Yes, at times it can be violent, yes, at times it can be frightening, and if you don't like the sight of blood, then you really shouldn't watch the movie but it shows how an innocent man suffered for his people and did it all for love. The acting in this movie is absolutely brilliant, because they make you feel for the characters, feel the pain and the fear, even Pilate, who didn't want to kill an innocent man. Though Jesus did suffer under him, because if he hadn't been flogged, then he wouldn't have suffered as much. The actors in this movie have made the characters depicted real and for any one who needs their faith renewed, I highly recommend this movie.",The Passion of the Christ

The priests were the ones to read the scriptures to the masses , instead of the masses reading the scriptures in their own dialect. And what's more the church-state integration of 15th century Spain.

1036,diddykv,The cause of confusion,10,18 May 2015,"I've seen a lot o people talking trash about this movie - even a lot of christians -, and I find it hard to understand why. Philosopher Peter Kreeft called it the ""most beautiful movie ever made"", and when I think about it in the light of the Christian faith, it's hard to disagree.First of all, passion means suffering, and for all those people that complain about the violence in the movie, I think it's because they don't get Christ's Passion at all. The emphasis on violence is fundamental, as it's what reveals how much God suffered because of what I did. So I, the spectator, am experiencing with all my emotions what I can only imagine and reflect about when reading the Gospels. And I'm not the kind of person that reads about Jesus crucified and direct relates it to all the bad things I did to contribute to that moment, and even when I do, it's more like in a lucid, almost indifferent way, while the movie forces me to feel the burden that I've put on My Lord's shoulder.This is of course from my Christian perspective, and I wouldn't even try to talk about what's great in the movie from a secular perspective. The lens through which one watches it it's what define its greatness. And that lens is faith. So I really don't think it's a big deal if an atheist doesn't like it; but if a catholic doesn't like it I'll be confused.The way Jim Caviezel plays Jesus is so powerful. He seems very humble, very vulnerable, very soft, yet very strong and confident. When he talks to the people, you feel so much goodness in his tone; when he is accused of blasphemy you can feel his innocence even if nothing is spoken. When he is carrying the cross and falls, Mary runs to him and it's such a symbolic scene of how much she loves her Son, and how much she wants His suffering to end, even though she accepts the will of God.Mel Gibson did a great job with all the symbolism in the movie: Mary's obedience; Judas' desperation; all the people shocked by Jesus' mere presence. There's so much of it, and it feels so natural.I can only assume that christians that don't like The Passion of the Christ are those that didn't actually take their time to think about the Passion of Christ. The movie is a chance to do so. It's ugly and repulsive? Yes, but only for a moment. When you realize that it captures the essence of God's love for humanity, it becomes eternally beautiful. Jesus didn't have to do that. He did because of me, because of you; because He is the good shepherd that lays his life for the sheep.So what if the reality of the Passion is full of gore and tears and injustice? We are the cause of that, and sometimes we better realize it by having it thrown on our faces, however hurt we may end up feeling. Just remember that our pain is nothing compared to our Lord's pain. I can only speak for myself when I say that my love for my Savior is very small; but I know very well that He loves me with a heart that is ready to bleed without hesitation, even though I'm not worth it.",The Passion of the Christ

We've never seen such a shocking, and when i mean ""shocking"" i mean realistic movie about Jesus. It's power might be present such as in the amazing photography work done, as in the characters speech. Like always, the director makes the difference between a normal passage of the story and an alternative one. The main difference is that, one scene of this movie makes all the difference.

Gibson i have read is a huge fan of Caravaggio's which is reflected in this films graphic depiction.  The decision to do this film in Aramaic and Latin was key to setting the tone and making the scenes that seemed famaliar both new and genuine at the same time.  This movie will be seen as one of the ""greats"" but not any time soon since a lot of the film establishment came out against it early, it is not likely they will admit their mistake. Simply go to the theatre and watch the reaction of casual viewers to this film, they come in eating popcorn and candy excpecting the regular spectacle and then you notice a change in the mood of the room. Its strange but its real, its art. This is a quality film and its a powerful message, the first film in a while that actually feels like art.  As to the violence, this film has violence, but it is done in a way thats stirs compassion and sorrow not rage or disgust. No one will leave this film more violent than they were coming in.  like other artforms its not suprising that Film is reaching its highest form in the service of religion.

Overall it is just another run to have a blockbuster of a movie at the expense of a gullible audience and capitalize on the emotions of the believers. With all the hype about Passion of the Christ I am amazed there is so little mention of Jesus of Nazareth (1977) by Franco Zeffirelli - by far a more compelling movie than Mel Gibson's version. By checking the movie page on IMDB is becomes clear that very few people have actually seen Zeffirelli's masterpiece - with only 773 user ratings and 3 postings.

1043,tseungmq,Violent as entertainment,1,8 March 2006,"There was not much of any plot in this movie, the main theme seemed to be how to torture Christ before he was crucified. I did not get a kick out of it. I didn't need to visualize to understand the sufferings Christ went through. My faith would not be strengthened just by seeing Christ's redemption to our sins in a movie.Thanks, Mel Gibson. Fake blood looked so real in that movie. I saw Passion of Christ as just another violent movie, no better than SAW, High Tension, or Hostel. The only different was Gibson linked his mere torture entertainment flick with the greatest story ever told. Gave it a good name and made it righteous.Making a movie in a foreign language did not make it any truer to the bible. Correct me if I'm wrong, this story happened in the middle east, not America. If Gibson wanted more 'reality', he should use colored actors for this movie. Putting explicit contents on the screen to tell the story of a suffering may be a proof of the ineffectiveness of the director.Good storytelling is not about how real you can make something fake real (e.g. Final Fantasy). Good storytelling is make believe. It's about how to let the audience into the movie world without the need to see everything.Please stop making violent movies.

1044,bs201v,The violence went too far.,6,1 March 2004,"I, like the previous reviewer, needed a couple days to recover from the movie before I could write my review.  I am certainly a person who believes that Jesus went through immense pain.  However, I thought the scene with the whipping went way too far.  A simple whipping with a bull whip is pain like you can not imagine.  A bamboo switch like those used in the film is even worse.  This is as far as I thought the movie should have gone.  When that guard picked up the stick with nails in it, I thought ""please do not show them using that on another human being.""  So when the guard put it down I was relieved.  Only to be more horrified by the whip with the little metal bits on it.  After the first stroke, when I saw what the result was, I couldn't bear to look.  I listened to the continuing strokes, knowing what each was doing to Jesus, and counting along with them in Italian.  When he got to 20 I thought ""OK, its over.""  But on it went...25, 30, 35, 40. Finally it stopped.  They are done right? Nope.  They flip him over and start again from 1.  And the way they (The Roman soldiers) were enjoying it. When I came out of the movie, I didn't hate Jews. But I wasn't too fond of Romans, and I truly hated Mel Gibson.  I will not see another one of his movies, ever.  This was a sick torture scene invented in his mind and goes far beyond what is in the bible.  And, if you are a Christian, you believe the bible is the word of God, verbatim.  No discussion, no interpretation. This goes far beyond the word of God and adds lots of speculation.  How many time did Jesus fall?  3 in the bible, 6 on screen.  There are other discrepancies which I will not go into.  My point is that it should have eased off on the torture, and focused more on what was known to have happened to Jesus.  If you enjoy watching the very lowest of humans torture another human in the most graphic of manners, then this is your movie.  If you don't I would suggest that when they start hitting Jesus with the bamboo, leave the theater to go to the bathroom and don't come back for at least 10 minutes.  The rest of the movie, overall, was very good.  I am sorry he ruined it with his vision of a beating and torture that went far beyond reasonable.",The Passion of the Christ

I doubt anyone, after seeing this movie, would not pick one up and at the least fact-check.  I do not think this is the most moving or compelling telling of Jesus' death, but it was very interesting.  Because Gibson chose to be accurate, I felt that the pace of the story suffered some.  I definitely appreciate what he was trying to do, but if one were to look at it as simply a movie, not as a documentary, it gets a bit tedious at times.  I was even bored.

PASSION begins with a poor reproduction of catholic Kitsch artwork: blue moonlight and foggy air; it is deeply fascinated with a very Gothic androgynous Satan-personification and culminates in anti-climatic slow-motion-action. Whenever there shall be 'meaning' the slow-motion returns as one of the very few stylistic specialties. The rest of the film concentrates on a suffering-body-performance (American actionism?) - pathetic event cinema with a propagandistic touch: Think of the same images in an adaptation of Jules Michelets inquisition-book 'La sorcière' and you will have a perfect anti-catholic movie. The suffering does not make a believer. The suffering is universal. This film is a typical example of contemporary American mainstream cinema celebrating the bloody 'sacrifice' for a 'noble idea' and searching for clearly recognizable polar opponents and enemies to head for 'easy viewing'. PASSION OF THE CHRIST is in that sense a very inhuman, dangerous and frightening affair.",The Passion of the Christ

This is the best Jesus movie ever told. It really does shows the sufferings of Jesus Christ.  One might think, how in the world would he be still alive after taking all those beatings? When I went to the theater, almost everyone was weeping, some were quietly, some you can actually hear.  I even shed down some tears, which I have done in very few movies. This movie dont tell the whole Jesus story, it focuses on what the title says ""The Passion Of Jesus Christ"", the last stage of his dying. I was amazed I did not had to read a whole lot of subtitles to understand what they were saying.  Matterafact, their language sentence are more longer than English.  The subtitle goes very slow, mixes well with their language. It gives you enough time to read and understand what they are saying.  The movie is indeed bloody in its catogary.  Do not compare this with any war movie or any action type movie, cause this is only one man who has been bloodied here and its his suffering story. You might want to give it a try even if you are not religious.  I did not find it any racistor hate towards anyone, just felt sad what he had to go through.  Give it a try guys you will see what I am talking about. I think I am ready for a second show :)",The Passion of the Christ
1049,zorcon,at a loss for words,3,25 February 2004,"I'll say straight away that I am not a religious person.  I'm not an atheist either.  I saw this movie with my mother who is a devout Seventh Day Adventist, and not even she liked it.  This movie is littered with excessive violence and gratuitous gore.  Seriously, I'm a huge horror movie fan, and even I found this to be disturbing.  If you knew me, that is saying a LOT. Aside from that, I wish that the movie had contained more story regarding Jesus and his life.  More background as to why the events in this movie are taking place.  Because of this, I would really not recommend this movie if you're not already religiously inclined.  Now, given the violence and gore...I have no idea why someone of faith would want to see this movie. If your beliefs are already in place, then this movie should do nothing for you.  It offers nothing new.  If this movie has changed your life, then your belief was frail to begin with.",The Passion of the Christ

1051,DeSade,Walking in another man's shoes,10,25 February 2004,"How often have you had the opportunity to walk in another man's shoes? How many times have you wondered what exactly did Christ go through in the hour preceding his crucifixion? Ever wonder what implements of torture ad punishment the Roman Empire used during its hold on the Holy Lands? Well, Mel Gibson answers all of your questions and more!This movie allows you to painstakingly walk in the shoes (sandals) of Christ. It allows you to feel a minute portion of the pain he suffered while being scourged. It lets you walk each step up the road to Golgotha and finally it forces you upon the crucifix to feel the nine-inch nails being driven through his hands and feet. While all this is happening, Jesus of Nazareth is letting those around Him know that all is forgiven and that they have no power over Him except what that is given from God above.I have never in my life seen a movie as powerful, ugly, violent, breathtaking, mesmerizing, riveting, and beautiful as the masterpiece that Mel Gibson has put together using the Bible as reference. After seeing the movie I came home and picked up the scriptures and re-read what the movie depicted. Granted, Gibson takes some poetic license to get the point across, but it follows the scripture 99.9%.The trip to Golgotha is plagued with pain upon the faces of those that loved Him so and also depicts the insane glee of the Roman guards that punished Christ as He made His way to His place of sacrifice. It is not often you see a film such as this that forces you to contemplate exactly what He did for mankind and the pain and suffering He endured.The movie itself:Acting: 10/10 - Superb performance by James Caviezel as Jesus of Nazareth. He felt the part and he conveyed the pain and strength that is in Christ. Rosalinda Celentano (Satan) did a wonderful job looking the part of the Deceiver. Her eyes are expressive and were full of hate, contempt and malice.Music: 10/10 - It draws you in, holds you, plinks at your heart strings and doesn't let you go. A fantastic score.Special Effects: 10/10 - The digital effects and the make-up were astounding.Believability: 10/10 -  The characters of the film speak in Latin, Aramaic, and Hebrew with English subtitles. The devices of torture, the armour and weapons, the religious costumes were as close to authentic as one could get.If you want a vanilla version of the life of Christ, go rent King of Kings (1961) with a blue-eyed Jeffrey Hunter. Not saying it is a bad movie, in fact it is good movie but it doesn't have the dramatic impact, nor does any other movie depicting Christ, that The Passion of the Christ has. If you want to walk with Christ in His last hours and share an experience of the pain He must have felt, go see this movie.Forget all the anti-Semitic talk. The Jews didn't kill Christ, the Poles didn't kill Him, and the Navaho Indians didn't do it either. It is not a matter of race or religious beliefs, the fact of the matter is MAN placed Christ on the cross at Golgotha. It wouldn't have mattered if Christ was from the North Pole and pygmies from Australia were doing the nailing of His hands and feet, they are of the Human race and thus are MEN.
Christ knew what had to be done to fulfill his calling here on Earth. He knew that He would be persecuted and thrown down by those of the Temple and he knew His life would end. Too many people look at the Bible and have the idea that it was a G-Rated world... they could be farther from the truth. The world then and the world now is just as X-Rated as it has ever been. The way Gibson told the story is they way we need to see it, for what it was... violent, unforgiving, and yet beautiful to behold the strength and enduring love of Jesus Christ.See the movie and experience it with an open mind. Walk in His shoes for a few hours. I wouldn't be taking anyone under the age of 12 to this movie as they would have a hard time digesting its mature content.",The Passion of the Christ
1052,Amourek,The Beating of Christ,1,22 July 2004,"There was nothing passionate about this flick. You would think that a 'moving' film about Jesus Christ would focus on how he lived, but sadly no, The Passion is based entirely on how horrible and gruesome his death was and how the Jews insisted he be killed and how guilty we should all feel about it. I honestly don't think the content qualifies as a 'film.' I only stayed til the end to see how far they would go and it was pretty far. At the end I requested and rightfully received a full refund from the theatre manager. Now if only I could get those hours of my life back...I was a little disappointed in how the Jews were portrayed, but any intelligent person would realize that if they believe at all in Christianity they would know that Jesus HAD to die and the people involved were just the instruments. Of course any intelligent person wouldn't be a racist, so definitely I can see how this film would encourage anti-semitism.In conclusion, I was not moved and I was not entertained. The only passion it incited in me was the passion to never again see a movie made by Mel Gibson. 1 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
1053,suephx,Humbling experience,10,18 February 2004,"I saw The Passion of the Christ in California last week.
Keeping my comments brief -I would like to thank Mel Gibson and Company for producing such a powerful depiction of the sacrifice, suffering and death of Jesus Christ.You'd have to be an idiot to think that everything up on that screen was exactly how it was, however, I believe Mr. Gibson, with the Holy Scriptures guiding him, did the best job possible.I would highly recommend this film to anyone who's a believer wanting a glimpse into the passion of Christ.Warning: It's not a pretty picture to watch - but it will humble you.Thank you.",The Passion of the Christ
1054,vegged,"All the blood and gore, but none of the passion.",7,19 March 2004,"I'm not sure if there are any spoilers here, BUT JUST IN CASE LET ME JUST SAY THAT THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD.  In case you haven't read the new testiment: Jesus dies at the end. Of course, if you've read the new testiment you would also know that Jesus lives at the end, too.  That's the good news that is barely touched on in the Mel Gibson biblical accounting of Jesus' crusifixion.  As for the movie, well lets just say it was lacking a certain something.  The movie could've been about any religion, about any man.  The life and message of Jesus wasn't adequately portrayed.  Just as in any story, I have to get to know the character before I can care for the character.  I think Gibson assumes too much here.  Yeah, the bible has been on the best seller list for centuries, but does that mean that the life and times of Jesus should just be skipped over?  I've heard so many Christians say that this is such a powerful and emotionally moving movie, but does the movie really state why Jesus died on the cross?  Does this movie make it clear that Jesus claimed to be the son of God and that he was a holy and pure sacrifice?  Does the movie make it clear that Jesus died for our sins? I don't remember anywhere in the film ever hearing that whosoever believes in the son will not die, but will have everlasting life. Instead, we get a heavy dose of blood and gore.  Anyone who has attended a Christian church or has read the New Testiment knows of the sacrifice and physical pain that the Messiah went through.  But all of that is really meaningless if the message of salvation is not included.",The Passion of the Christ
1055,sbentley-90703,Maybe the most important film ever made.,10,5 August 2021,Gibson's brave attempt to enter the most scrutinized critical subject in world history is unmatched. The single most intense and spiritually moving film in the history of filmmaking. Gibson's accurate portrayal of the brutal Roman society built to punish its enemies leaves the audience uncomfortably numb. I've never witnessed a theater audience in actual agony prior to or since this movie. We may never see this type of filmmaking again in our current society.,The Passion of the Christ

The movie theater was packed like I expected & the theater was so quiet. This is a must see for everyone. The violence shows how bad it all was back when Jesus of Nazereth was treated like this. Some people just didn't understand how powerful his presence was to certain communities in those times. Mel does a fantastic job with his view of the last hours of Christ & the whole cast, including the lead, Jim Caviezel, did an outstanding job. I know that it is really early to predict anything for next years Oscars, but I believe that this movie will be a front-runner in most of the categories, including Best Actor, Director, Picture, Supporting Actress & quite a few more. Go see this powerful movie for yourself & be the judge. You will either respect Mel's artistic vision or just despise him.

1061,kalils,Most historically accurate account of Jesus' crucifixion,10,26 February 2004,"Mel Gibson showed his passion in faithfully producing this accurate depiction of Christ's final 12 hours. Everything I have ever studied in regards to the first century culture as well as the methods of Roman executions were accurately depicted in great detail. The movie's faithfulness to the story as told by the four gospels was also very impressive. I have seen many stories about Jesus' life, but Mr. Gibson's idea of shooting it in the original languages, using subtitles and combined with a middle-eastern sounding musical score actually brought the story to life.Seeing and hearing Christ and His disciples conversing in Aramaic added to the realism of the movie. Gibson's use of Italian actors as Romans also brought the dead language of Latin to life. The camera work was amazing as was the way he blended the present with clips from the past. All these things combined made it easy to believe that we were watching Jerusalem in the first Century.The main actors gave strong performances, especially Jim Caviezel and Maia Morgenstern as Jesus and His mother. The claims of anti-Semitism are misguided. If anyone was to complain about how they were portrayed, it should have been the Italians. The Roman soldiers were absolutely viscous. Of course, history tells us that also. Besides, the Jews in this film were portrayed exactly as history recorded them in the four gospels. Gibson was right when he said that those who have a problem with his movie really have a problem with the four gospels. He was amazingly faithful to the Bible.So what about the violence? There is plenty of it. However, that is the whole reason for the film, to show the `Passion' of the Christ. The theme, which is lost on many who do not believe, is simple. Jesus willingly endured all the pain as a redemptive sacrifice for all of humanity. That is the passion. After all, if Jesus could have died easily and conquered death, would it have been such a sacrifice? It would cheapen the act as if He was Bill Murray's character in `Ground Hog's day', driving his car into a ditch with a large rodent riding shotgun, knowing all along that he would wake up the next morning. The Passion shows the pain that Jesus endured even though He had the power to save Himself at any moment.Believers will be moved, the reaction of others will likely reflect their view of Christainity and its followers. While not for the young, I think this movie is a must see for everyone, regardless of their spiritual beliefs.",The Passion of the Christ

Whether you believe Jesus as the son of God or not, it is a historical proven fact that a man by this same description was crucified in this exact way and endured everything depicted in this movie. Before watching it, the fact that it was in Arameic was a bit of a turn off, however, after the first 10 min you forget it's in Arameic and actually understand it all. It's an amazing film which we always love to watch during Easter, a must see at least once a year. Thank you Mel and Jim and everyone involved. God Bless you all!",The Passion of the Christ

1066,LadyIslay,"It is difficult to believe that one man has so much blood to shed; and yet, He does.",10,25 February 2004,"There is a lot of blood in this movie.  A lot.  It is not a movie for children.  That said, the blood is a stark reminder of the brutal reality of the events surrounding the torture and execution of the man called Jesus of Nazareth.  It is also a graphic visual representation of the spiritual nature of the film.  A metaphor in so many ways, regardless of your view on transubstantiation.The movie is a great honour to Mary, the mother of Jesus.  This is as much a story about her agony as it is about the Passion of the Christ.  Don't take me wrong - this is a movie about Jesus, but her portrayal in the film highlights the role she played in his life.As for the controversy surrounding the film, in regard to anti-Semitic feelings it might arouse, I will say this: no one group in the film comes out looking good or bad.  The Jews are certainly the ones chanting `Crucify him!', but they are also the ones weeping and moaning as Jesus drags his cross through the streets.  Among the high priests, there are those that oppose the actions being taken.  They are, of course, tossed out of the temple, but they are there nonetheless.  Of the Romans, some take delight in the torture of Jesus; others are profoundly awed by Him.  As for the Christians, we witness the devotion of Mary and Mary Magdalene, the betrayal of Judas, and the denial of Peter.
Do I recommend this film?  Chances are you already know the story... and the sequel.  This isn't something you're going to go to be 'entertained'.  It is something you're going to see because you want to witness what is probably the most significant historical event of the last two-thousand years as it might have actually happened.  If you're not a Christian, take heart that the 'supernatural' intrusions of the film are minimal enough to make the film historical.  Remove Satan, the healing of the arresting guard and the final seconds, and you have a 'historical' film.

1067,bencooper-86632,Very violent but very good!,10,30 May 2020,I loved this movie. It had plenty of violence and disturbing crucifixion scenes. Some of the violence I was disturbed! This is not for young kids-for sure!,The Passion of the Christ
1068,haritari,Bit of a let-down for a non-Christian.,5,22 March 2005,"I'll preface my remarks by saying that although I was raised Baptist, I am not currently a practicing Christian. I hold no resentment towards Christianity; in fact, I find the tenets of Christianity in their purest form to be beautiful and worthy of devotion. But I'm not a Christian, and thus - while I retain a fair amount of familiarity with the story of Christ from my Bible School days - I do not have a personal relationship with Christ. Unfortunately, the lack of that relationship made it very difficult for me to feel connected to ""The Passion"" at all.While often exposition in a film can be tedious and unnecessary, its absence in this piece left me wondering how people unfamiliar with Christ's story would understand what was going on. Christ's prayer in the garden before his betrayal by Judas made some allusive references to Christ being the Son of God...but never came out and said so; there were a few references to Jesus' conflict with the Pharisees, but no actual concrete explanation of why they pursued his death so viciously; there were some flashback sequences to the last supper, but not enough of them to explain what was happening. Without a solid grounding in Christian mythos, it would be very difficult to follow what was happening and why....and more importantly, without those essential building blocks for character development, it was challenging to be invested in the tragedy. Yes, a man being beaten with such offhand blood lust is horrific and disturbing...but it would've been much more impactive if it was happening to a character in whom I'd become emotionally invested through good storytelling.The acting performances in the film were, frankly, unimpressive. Jim Caviezel shows potential in the numerous flashback scenes, displaying the warmth and accessible wisdom you'd want in a portrayal of Jesus...but he spends most of the movie writhing under make-up and facial prosthetics such that a blurry glance from the eye not swollen shut is the extent of his expression, and his talents seem woefully underused. The Marys also seem underused to me; both wear thin their expressions of horror, pain, shock, and mourning...but again, they spend so much time chasing Jesus from one scene to the next, it's hard to get a bead on their ability to truly portray anything. The majority of the movie seemed to me to be tied up in mob scenes, violence, and too short flashbacks...with no room for any actor to step up and perform.The Goddess symbolism of the film was a surprise to me. First, in the garden prayer and conversation with Satan, there was the distinct sense that God was represented by the moon, a traditional Goddess symbol. Second, the maiden-mother-crone imagery with Magdalen-Mary-Satan all wearing black hoods and wearing a particular face of the Goddess, was a tremendous surprise; that current is one that I've always sensed in Christianity, but to see it so clearly displayed was interesting.Overall, the film was interesting to watch if you were familiar with the story beforehand, but difficult to tie into without a Christian context and emotional lexicon to work with. For Christians, it seems to be an emotional experience that defies words...but for non-Christians, I don't think it carries the same weight.",The Passion of the Christ

I truly believe the Lord died for me and to see it and what he went through for us is overwhelming. I just hope people got that out of this movie. Mel did it this movie as it was back then and seeing this made me feel I was actually there in person.We need more movies about the Lord.These things happened and we need not to be afraid to talk about this and not to be afraid to speak up and say we are Christians and I believe in God.There for I am a Christian and I believe in God.

For us to call ourselves ""good"", is to blind ourselves to the truth. Want to see a truly good and loving person?

1071,pauleveritt,It does not preach for you or to you,9,18 October 2006,"This film must be viewed in two different ways. It must be viewed as a film and as a message.A film: The cinematography was some of the very best I have ever seen. This visual impact was truly amazing. As jaded as I am, I even flinched when the guards brought out the flails. Unfortunately, without a lot of background work, you would not know what is going on or what is meant in some of the scenes. The subtitling was spotty at best. A Latin teacher added a lot to the movie by telling me what was being said, but not translated in the subtitles.In the scene where Jesus is being beaten by the Roman guards, the guards started with whips and then changed to sticks. The Latin word for sticks is tibia, just like the small bone in your leg. Tibia can also be translated as flute. In the movie, as they reached for the sticks, one of the guards makes a play on words and says ""these flutes will play a tune on your back"". Unfortunately if you didn't speak Latin, you would have missed this because this wasn't translated in the subtitles. There are several places where better subtitling would have added a lot to the movie.As a message: It is definitely not going to preach for you or to you. The movie concentrates on the last 12 hours before Jesus is crucified. If you did not already know what was going on, you would have a hard time following the story. Much of legend is added to the story and lots of visual allusion is added to the mix. The crows represented evil for instance. Without extensive prior study of this non-Biblical material, I would not have had a clue in several spots. No wonder Mel Gibson provided a guide on the movie web site.Overall, a visual feast for the film buff. I really like that fact that the original languages were used but this should have been supported with more complete subtitling.",The Passion of the Christ
1072,belarmino-27692,Irrepetible,10,23 July 2021,La película más impresionante de las rodadas en torno a la figura histórica de Jesucristo.

1073,carmanrosales,Not Biblically sound unfortunately....,6,20 February 2021,"The biggest issue with the film, however, are the artistic liberties taken with the source material. It's not word-for-word faithful to the Bible, which is understandable, since the film would have probably droned on for hours if it was. However, the film can be nit-picked for getting certain facts wrong: the manner in which Jesus resurrects Lazarus differs from what's in the Bible, Jesus causing a ruckus in the temple occurs way sooner than it should have, Peter denouncing Jesus thrice happens later than it should have, and so on. The film throws in more scenes with Pilate's wife, for no apparent reason.Like Jesus repairing a table with his mother Mary. We have to be VERY careful not to add to Scripture, but Mel Gibson does so anyway.And I'm no fan of Mel Gibson - his life of leaving his wife and shacking up with all his girlfriends came AFTER 'Passion of the Christ'The biggest omission, however, is the absence of the most important villain: Satan. He's nowhere to be seen at all. I only learned later that these scenes were actually cut, because of concerns that Satan looked too much like President Obama. Ugh, really? Well, fine, whatever. Because of all that, Jesus only has to put up with evil people in this movie; the film does a fine job of underscoring the evil of human beings at certain times, but without the Devil tempting and testing Christ (and subverting humanity), some important lessons and themes are cut out (including the biggest one of them all: good triumphing over evil).",The Passion of the Christ
1074,solidviper102010,Great movie and in my opinion better than Lord of the rings,10,29 March 2004,"I first saw ""The Passion of the Christ"" at a pre-screening that one of the churches in town sponsered and since then I have seen the movie two other times. My opinion of the is this; it is the best representation of Jesus Christ that has ever been filmed, it is not at all like those Jesus movies from the 50's (The robe, King of Kings) that were poorly done and kind of corny. This movie while extremely graphic, the violence goes to show what sacrifice Christ made for the sins of mankind. The movie is also very well put together and its obvious that the people that were involved with the production of the film believe in Christ(unlike ""the last temptation of the christ""). Since the films release in late February 2004, the movie has done extremely well and like christianity itself some people love this movie and some hate it. All in all ""The passion""  is an excellent film that with a moral that some people do not get(Those people that call the film anti-semetic and throw Lamb's blood on Mel GIbson and Jim Caviezel); the moral is: Christ, whether you believe he was the messiah or not sacrificed himself for the good of mankind and hopefully after you see what Jesus went through you will pick up a Bible and read or reread the gospel",The Passion of the Christ
1075,as_your_attorney,Hmmm? Did I fall asleep?,1,28 March 2004,"Religious issues and alleged anti-semitism aside, The Passion of Christ waspossibly the worse film I have seen since God knows when. Everything from its soupy Spielbergian violin strings every two seconds to the most horrendous use of cgi and the risable faux Terminator-style ending with Christ doing a passable impression of the T-1000 made me wonder what kind of visitations Gibson hadrecived ENCOURAGING him to make such a filmic travesty.I happened to see the film with a group of Christian friends who proceeded to cry throughout the entire 2 hours, leading me to belive that The Passion was a vitriolic and exploitative representation of the religion totally ignoring Christs preachings of peace, love and good will. And hats off to Gibson for hammering home the point that Jesus was hurt alot during his final hours, because without his over descriptive use of fake blood and latex wounds I would never havethought that crucifixion was a nasty way to go.Never mind Christs pain, I was more worried about how numb my own butt was,and I couldnt help thinking that perhaps I should have stayed at home.",The Passion of the Christ
1076,BroesWillis,"Disgusting, ridiculously sadistic",5,6 October 2004,"First of all I expected a true realistic movie but the attitude of the torturers and the people who are supporting them is far 'beyond' normal. Of course most (stupid) people turn into animals ones they got all the power, but knowing that there was reason nor proof, their attitude in the movie is totally unacceptable. I can't understand Mel Gibson's intentions, 'cause this movie could have been much better if more realistic and with some more dialogue. Now it seems more like a comedy, which I think is completely out of place for this story (despite that I'm a not religious). I always liked Mel Gibson as an actor but since I watched this movie I can't get rid of the impression of him being sadistic himself. This is a story everybody knows since childhood and the only thing the director adds is violence and overdone sadism without a reason for anger or hate. Even after several orders to stop the torturing, the soldiers slap on. In case this movie follows the bible exactly, like some users write, than it only strength my believe that the bible is a fairy tale. B.t.w., no man would be able to endure all this without going unconscious or even dying. The joke of it all is the release of a potential, dangerous murderer (on request by the people) in exchange for a merciful man, Jesus! Jesus! Incredible! 5/10. The 5 is for the pictures and the leading actors.",The Passion of the Christ
1077,otte4,A little on the Gruesome side,5,25 February 2004,"For starters this film did not have to be two hours long.  Gibson could have cut about an hour out and still have told the same story. But all the movie really is, is a two hour long torture scene of Jesus, it just drags out and out and out and out.  The scrouging scene was especially violent but it went on for about five minutes, I went up to go take a leak, came back and they were still beating the crap out of the poor guy. The scene where Jesus carries the cross up the hill drags long as well.  What is the point in this? Keep in mind though I do not hold traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs and I probably should have mentioned this earlier and I apologize for that. In case you are wondering why I would choose to see this film, two reasons. A. The contraversy surrounding the film, and B. I admire Jesus as a person. I don't believe that he is the son of God because I believe we are all Sons and Daugthers of God, but I admire as I admire Ghandi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandella etc.  So the violence just drags out and is very gratuitous. As far as it being Anti-Semetic, I could totally understand where someone would belive that.  The Jews in this film are really thirsting for the blood of Christ but it is the Romans who appeared to me as being much more violent towards Christ.  So I really didn't get the impression that Gibson was saying that the Jews alone were the ones responsible for the death of Christ because I got the sense that it was pointing a finger at Humanity itself. Overall I think the film would be good to see one time, and one time only, if for nothing more the sake of discussion.",The Passion of the Christ
1078,otte4,Absolutely Disgusting!,5,3 April 2004,"This was nothing more than a two hour snuff film.  It seems almost as though that Mel Gibson's intention with this film was to convert non-believers by guilting them by exaggerating what Christ suffered through, (although I think it was really horrible I don't believe it was probably anything what it was like in the movie. The only decent thing in this movie was Jim C.'s performance.  But Mel focuses very little on the life of Christ, and his message of love, hope and forgivenss, but focuses wholeheartedly on the brutal way he was killed and tortured.  The final scene in Braveheart where Wallace gets tortured was bad enough to watch and that lasted ten minutes? Eight Minutes? if that? Then why would someone want to watch a movie where the only thing you see is a poor innocent man getting whipped and beaten and then crucified? No thanks.",The Passion of the Christ
1079,R_Ethier,"This is boring, not controversial",3,21 March 2004,"Before I go any further, I have never seen a film as technically well made as this when it comes to makeup.Now, there ARE spoilers in this review.
Jesus dies, gets resurrected, etc...Now with that that out of the way, what kind of movie was this?The violent, pointless kind.  I personally don't care much about Jesus, there are people that have died much more horrible deaths then this guy allegedly did and in much more recent times as well.  Maybe that allowed me to be more detached then most people, after the shock of violence wore off I basically tuned out.  And being that the violence starts a whole 5 minutes into the film (maybe less) and doesn't let up a whole lot, I stopped caring pretty damn quick.I knew the ending of the film, and the underlying plot is basically guy getting screwed over. There is no suspense, no nothing, just some guy getting beat to a bloody pulp and then nailed to a cross. Thats it, nothing else really happens.  There is one period of blackness during the film which left me thinking ""Credits, or resurrection?"", and that about sums up the most suspenseful part of the whole film.  The whipping scene even gets boring after a while, it just keeps going and going and going, it's almost a parody after a while.  I can see Mel Brooks making a film called ""Jesus: Back from the dead"" where they (Romans) pull out machine guns and make Jesus dance or something.""I said to punish him, not make him suicidal by forcing him to listen to Air Supply""The movie never set out to be anything more then Jesus getting beat to a pulp and then nailed to a cross (the gospel or something, I guess), but that doesn't make it a good movie.  Technically impressive yes, but otherwise a gory bore.Now, if Jesus was black, obviously insane, and nevertheless inspired the people around him with delusions of a utopia and eventually got killed because of it.  Well, that would be a good movie.I guess one could interpret Jesus that way, even in the context of this film.  But that didn't stop me from being bored out of my mind.In this film, Jesus invents chairs (in a flashback) and..... Gets beat up..... A lot... Oh, and he eats some thin bread, and he falls down once when he is a kid, I think anyways, that part caught me off guard, I was kinda dozing and didn't know what was going on.  Oh, did I mention he gets the living crap kicked out of him?There are like, a lot of pages in the bible before the ""Jesus gets killed"" part, what happened to them?  If they were in this film for more then a meaningless flashback, I might actually care about Jesus.The most interesting part of the film was the conflicted head Roman guy, who's name I remember but can't spell at the moment.  He was the deepest character in the whole film, and Judas was kinda cool as well.  I guess the characters are cliche for a reason, considering the movies source material.Whatever....  Should have seen Dawn of the dead instead,,,",The Passion of the Christ
1080,akuzi,A Gospel story done Hollywood-style,6,28 February 2004,"Mel Gibson has made a super-violent version of the Gospel story of the Passion (ie. the suffering) of Christ. It recounts the story of Jesus's judgement by Pilate, the stations of the Cross and the crucificion itself.
The movie emphasises (some would say exaggerates!) the physical suffering of Jesus, but the question i kept asking myself during the movie was 'so what?'. Sure I felt a strong emotion - (ie. disgust) at the level of brutality, and some level of empathy with Jesus - but i'm not going to confuse this with feelings of spirituality!If the movie was meant to be purely fictional - most reviewers would probably say it had a weak plot (the main character is condemned and then dies nailed to a cross, where's the plot there?) and it's only the violence that holds the movie together. There is very little dialogue and it's difficult to understand the motives of the characters.Also I think it's fair to say the movie takes a lot of 'artistic' license with the Gospel stories (and the legend of the Stations of the Cross - which originated much later).Some Hollywood-style additions include some horror-style special effects - a bunch of monster-children tormenting Peter, a giant raven (reminiscent of 'The Omen') that appears at the end to pluck out the eyes of one the criminals being crucified with Jesus not to mention the frequent appearance of a cloaked Devil-himself!To finish on a more philosophical note. As an agnostic - i wonder if a Christian's faith is based partly on meditating about the huge physical sacrafice Jesus made - then i think the faith is built on shaky ground indeed, since crucificion and flogging were widespread back Roman times - yes it was very barbaric but thousands of people crucified (many who also claimed were prophets incidently). There was nothing 'special' about what happened to Jesus. True most of these people didn't died on their Cross forgiving the people who put them up there - but Jesus's message of love and forgiveness were common themes in much older religions. (eg Bhudda preached the same thing in 600BC!)",The Passion of the Christ
1081,akuzi,Masochistic Catholic guilt-trip,6,1 March 2004,Oh dear. Mel Gibson really is a nutter.Is this really what Christianity is all about - where is the spirituality here?This film felt completely flat for me. The violence was so absurdly over-the-top that after a while it just got boring. The Roman soldiers and Jewish leaders are also absurd caricatures and not real people at all.What is the point of this movie? To gain some sort of catharsis out of watching someone else's physical pain? To see yourself up there being punished for your sins? It struck me as a very twisted version of Catholocism to want to meditate on Jesus's physical suffering to such a ridiculous excess. It makes me wonder what sort of 'issues' the Director is carrying around.If you are one of the people who saw this movie and felt _personally_ _responsible_ for each of the lashings Jesus received then i suggest you stop feeling such guilt and go out there and fix any wrong goings you are feeling bad about (or better still go see a therapist!).,The Passion of the Christ
1082,kdesign-1,The first christian slash film,1,26 February 2004,"At least I now have a visual reference for the sado-masochistic iconography of the Mel Gibson wing of the Catholic Church. May this film spawn no imitators. I would never take a child to this film, as many apparently have.",The Passion of the Christ
1083,bst112,Breathtaking,10,25 February 2004,"This movie was a motion picture MASTERPIECE, and this is even after having seen Braveheart. It was fantastic.I hope no one can say they ""enjoy"" the film, but one should leave the theater fulfilled. There isn't antisemitism, there isn't any attempt to convert people to Catholicism (the lead actor and director's religion of choice). The cinematography was moving and brilliant, that cannot be denied. It's not a piece of Christian fluff - it's not pretty. It's realistic.
If one is an ardent anti-Christian secularist who loathes all things related to Christianity, see the movie as a historically accurate period piece with ""a touch of mysticism"" which can be an adequate description of the Godly aspects of the film. Seriously, it's worth it.Look, many people have done many awful things in the past proclaiming that they do so in the name of Christ. This isn't true - Jesus was against force and war, against brutality and the natural penchant of man to do ill to his fellow man. This is a historical figure, not simply a religious figure. Movies are made about religious and historical figures, but somehow there needs to be some sort of former cultural taboo in order to make it acceptable. This shouldn't be the case. Go see the movie for the story of the man, the truth of the dreadful things he as an individual (a HUMAN) endured.It's worth every penny, every moment of your time. I mean it. I would be the first to say that Gibson was doing something bad for Christianity. I believe that, as a director, he put his heart, soul, and savings into this movie - and it paid off. It is a beautiful piece of ART. That is what it is - art. He did a fantastic job. He isn't doing anything but telling the same story that has been told for two thousand years now, just as we hear stories about Muhammed, Moses, etc.",The Passion of the Christ
1084,solidussnakess,very well done and unfairly attacked,10,25 February 2004,"It is surprising that people are so divided over this film. They either hate it or love it. I myself having finished seeing it feel that the attacks on this and mel gibson are unfair and unsubstantiated. The movie is very well acted and the pace is fast paced. There is not a single boring scene placed in as filler. Gibsons direction is masterful and better than 90% of the directors out there. It should be noted that this movie is specifically about the events leading to the crucifixion, not a life story on jesus, so dont expect much of a background in it. It starts off as jesus in the woods near the temple. He is praying and seems to suddenly realize his destiny.He must die. Although not in the gospels, gibson includes satan in the scene, trying to get jesus to deny and doubt his calling. This is especially effective as a storytelling technique, showing that this is clearly a battle between good and evil right from the beginning. Jesus is then betrayed by judas who then regrets his action with his life. Condemned by the high priests as a blasphemer, jesus is sentenced to death by the bloodthirsty majority of the crowd(pontius pilate reluctantly condemns him, first asking the crowd what they think shoud happen).The rest is history. Jesus is beaten and whipped unmercifully. He is then forced to carry his cross to the mount.In a very touching scene, he is seen ebracing the cross instead of being frightened by it.Gibson cuts from the events to flashbacks of jesus' youth. He shows jesus' love for his mother, and his kindness to others, driving them from sin by forgiving them, not condemming them. He shows compassion to mary magdalene, while every one else wants to stone her to death. As for the violence, it is extreme and brutal. But we must remember that jesus was beaten, whipped and crucified. It would be irresponsible and just plain silly to tone the violence down so as to not shock people. It is after all the killing of a man, and there is no pg-13 way to accurately portray a crucifixion. It is no more violent as other movies, ex. kill bill(which i liked a lot too) where the violence is gratuitus and videogame-like. So is it absolute truth? Is jesus the messiah? those are not reasons to love or hate this film. see it as a moviegoer, not as a theologian. As a film, this is excellent and deserves much praise. The acting, directing, all very well done. As towards anti-semitism, i call anyone a fool if he/she leaves this movie thinking it is somehow antisemitic, because it is so clearly not. Jesus himself is a jew so to say it is antisemitic is to say that mel gibson hates jesus too. Think about that,duh.

1086,roblenihan,Sick Piece of Garbage,1,30 July 2006,"As a Christian, I am revolted by this hideous snuff film that Mel Gibson has inflicted upon the world. I wanted to take a shower after viewing this abomination. It seems Mr. Gibson was out to create a new genre: the religious slasher movie. He succeeded all too bloody well.The film wallows in images of sadistic abuse while ignoring Christ's message of love and salvation. I remember when this thing first came out and church groups were flocking to theaters by the busload to view this repulsive pile of garbage. Watching this film was akin to taking a tour of slaughterhouse. I think it is only too fitting that I finally saw this piece of junk on the same weekend St. Mel of Malibu was arrested for drunken driving while allegedly peppering the arresting officers with anti-Semtic insults. Tell me, oh Lethal Weapon, do you think this is how Jesus would behave?This thing is the product of a very sick mind and I cannot stress enough that Mel Gibson and his cult of pseudo-Christians do not speak for me.",The Passion of the Christ
1087,DonDrysdale,surprisingly overrated,1,18 April 2004,"I saw this movie on opening day, expecting the worst.  And by worst, I mean the most graphic violence ever depicted on screen.  While I was still made uncomfortable by some scenes, I didn't find it to be as sickening as I first expected, which was a plus.  However, in virtually every other aspect of the film, I was dissapointed.  The acting is fine, I suppose, although since none of the dialog was in a language I could understand, I have no idea how their delivery was.  The cinematography was fine, but the visual impact of the movie was undercut by one shot in which blatant use of CGI took me out of the movie.  God's ""tear drop"" was a bit much for me, in that regard. The biggest problem with this movie is that, indeed, there is very little humanity in it.  We never get to see Jesus as the charismatic spiritual leader that he was meant to be.  His character is reduced to a plot device. This movie will only be powerful if you are a devout believer.  If you're not Christian, it's a waste of time, since there's virtually no story, and sitting through seemingly two hours of endless torture isn't worth it.",The Passion of the Christ
1088,timstumbo,"""I'm Sorry I Forgot""",10,2 February 2004,"A Review of ""The Passion of The Christ"" by Chris Crain ---I'm writing this a few days after attending a screening of the new Mel Gibson film The Passion of the Christ. It has taken a little while to `recover' from watching the film so I could write the review. This film is like no other I've ever seen and I doubt there is another anywhere that compares.By now it's been pretty well documented that Gibson, who directed and produced the film, has been very `passionate' about this project. He was on hand for the screening I attended and admitted he spent $25-$30 million of his own money on the picture. It has been his labor of love since he first thought of doing the film 12 years ago.You probably also know he was turned down by every major studio before New Market Films came on board. At the screening I attended, he looked like a man who has been working a lot of late hours and flown a lot of miles trying to make this movie happen. So I'll leave those topics alone and just talk about the film. Am I endorsing it? Yes. Is it a film that everyone should see? No.First of all, the film is rated `R', and rightly so. It contains no profanity or sexual material. This movie got it's rating for one reason: incredibly brutal content. After the first 45 minutes or so (which are not a walk in the park), the film launches into some of the most violent scenes I've ever seen on film.  There are several reasons the violence is so shocking. First of all, this is not `Friday the 13th' with anonymous victims dying in ways that seem designed to make an audience roll their eyes. The violence in The Passion of The Christ is focused on one person, who takes a beating so severe it seems nearly impossible to believe it actually happened.Second, the violence is unflinching. James Dobson of Focus On The Family calls it `gut-wrenching'. The camera does not soften the brutality with various angles and cutaways, but instead stays focused on the scenes until it's nearly unbearable.Last, the violence is hard to watch because it happened to a real person. This movie is based on a true story. As you watch terrible atrocities happening on screen, you can't help thinking `he really went through that'.Gibson said that after an earlier screening, someone told him `I'm sorry I forgot'. I think that's what Gibson is trying to do with this movie: remind. Jesus Christ paid a price that day, and the cost was very high. Of course, the good news is, the story doesn't end there (and neither does the movie).Is the movie biblically accurate? Yes. Gibson does take poetic license at times (for example, Satan appears in the crowd at times), but nothing is anti-scripture. The movie is also based on all four gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) and combines elements from all of them into one story. It's a difficult task and Gibson does a fine job pulling it off.Jim Caviezel (Frequency) plays Jesus and does a fine job as well. With make-up and even digital effects on his eye-color to make him look more `authentic', he's hard to recognize. The film's dialogue is in Latin, Aramaic, and Hebrew with English subtitles. This also gives the film an authenticity rarely seen in previous films about Christ.The film opens in over 2,000 theatres on February 25th. I wonder how people are going to react to this film. Shock? No question. Disgust? Maybe. Wanting to know more? I hope so. I have a feeling a lot of people are going to want to immediately read the gospels, and that's a good thing!  Mel Gibson-thanks for the reminder.",The Passion of the Christ

I went into this movie expecting some of the greatest torture scenes ever compiled, but I was let down. Mel Gibson pours the CGI violence on WAY too heavy in this one. Many of my friends thought the scene where the nine-tails whip tore the flesh from Jesus' ribs was a real gut wrencher but I wasn't that impressed. There's a lot more to making a good torture scene than just making it graphic. You've got to know how much to show and how much too hide. Reservoir Dogs had one of the best torture scenes ever filmed, but you barely saw any of it, that's what made it work. Gibson should have done a better job planning out his project. If you want to see a well done torture flick, check out Ichi the Killer. That movie also showed a lot, but it did it properly. Plus that movie had lots of laughs, which the Passion also didn't deliver on. All in all worth a watch, but not spectacular.

1093,xaracaturist,Mixed Feelings,5,27 February 2004,"I had mixed feelings about The Passion of The Christ. First of all, don't take the kids until you have seen it. The graphic violence is very powerful. I thought the acting, overall, was decent. The Roman soldiers were cartoonish in their brutality and immaturity. I felt they were way overdone. Satan looked like a gothic teenager, not like Lucifer, God's most beautiful angel. I thought this was a huge disservice. It will lower many people's guards.Lastly, this movie has caused a huge uproar among Jewish viewers. Well friends, if you had liked the book, you would be Christians. What makes you think you'd like the movie any better? John 19 repeatedly states it was the Jewish leaders pushing Pilate to crucify Him. We call it history, not anti-semitism. If you want a secular opinion, read the Works of Josephus. God sent Christ to die for all of us. The blame or fault does not lay with the Jewish people, the Romans, Judas, or Pontius Pilate. It lies with you and with me.I am glad that this has people talking about the Gospel. I don't know how informative it is, but it does draw out a lot of emotions. Read the Book of John.",The Passion of the Christ
1094,benjaminbraeuer,The greatest movie I've ever seen,10,18 September 2008,"I love this movie and have seen it multiple times. Watching it is not just watching a movie. It's going through a profound spiritual process with open eyes, ears, heart and spirit.Not everyone likes this film. Well, that's okay. People just focus on different aspects and come from different backgrounds. There is so much blood and suffering in this movie. It might be just too much for some. I certainly know people who I would hesitate to recommend it to because of the explicit display of cruelty.I've learned that a lot of people are just undereducated concerning Jesus Christ and his atonement/sacrifice. When they watch this movie, all they see is a man being tormented to death. To them watching ""The Passion"" is no different an experience than watching movies like ""Hostel"" or ""Saw"". They just can't seem to grasp the spiritual dimension of Christ's suffering, death and resurrection.Can I imagine a ""lighter"" way to tell this story? Yes, of course. Would less violence be better? Well, yes and no. Yes regarding all those for whom it's just too much to take. No for others (like me) to whom the cruelty shown only adds to the intensity of the process of learning and inner growth. I am so deeply moved every time I see Christ suffer more than anyone else possibly could without dying. I am amazed by the dignity in his eyes during all of this. He could have said ""Stop!"" any time he wanted, but he wouldn't - until finally it was time for him to lay down his life by his own free will. (And don't dare call this a ""spoiler""! ;)) It's not only ""what"" he did, it's also ""how"" he endured it. I know no other film which has ever portrayed the sublime dignity and majesty of Jesus Christ's perfect and divine character in such a marvelous way. Jim Caviezel's performance appeared to me as if it was not of this world.I'm aware that to many viewers this film is nothing more than just another movie and to some even less than that. To me it's nothing short of a spiritual feast which happens to be a beautifully and almost perfectly filmed movie. It's the greatest movie I've ever seen portraying the greatest event and the greatest hero of all time.",The Passion of the Christ
1095,Engineer_by_day,"Excellent pacing, editing, and realism.",10,5 March 2004,"Most people in the Western Hemisphere have heard this story before; many hear about it regularly.  What, then, does ""The Passion of the Christ"" have to offer?  Why is it any better than previous movies about the same old story?  Through well-thought direction and editing, it forces us to look at the Passion in realistic detail and to see suffering in ALL the characters.
It's easy for us to read the Bible and gloss over details.  Most crucifixes don't show Jesus to be mangled, but that's what scripture describes. Likewise, in previous film treatments, the violence and length of Christ's suffering has been toned down.  Here we get a different feeling because almost the entire 2-hour film takes place between Jesus' arrest and his crucifixion.  The march to Calvary alone felt like half an hour.  In that time, you really get some idea how it must've been to carry the cross for miles through Jerusalem.Further, this unhurried pace allows us to see the reactions and interactions of the other characters.  This is accentuated by showing various characters with Jesus in flashback; the moment when Mary rushes to Jesus' side as he falls under the cross was powerful.  The fact that every major character from Mary to Pilate suffers (in their own way) adds great depth to a story that is often focused solely on Jesus.This film is far more realistic than any previous interpretation I've seen. Is it violent?  Yes.  Is it exceedingly violent or gory?  Certainly not. Without showing the physical pain Jesus endured, it is easy for us to dismiss his sacrifice and his ability to forgive his persecutors. Besides, this film is less graphic than many other R-rated movies.  If anything, it's the REALISM of the violence that makes this film unsettling; it's not surreal or cartoonish like in many movies.One final note... claims that this film is anti-Semitic are completely unjustified.  Not only does the movie closely follow the Bible (a book seldom described as anti-Semitic), but it even shows that there were several priests and common Jews who found no argument with Jesus.  What we see is that CERTAIN priests had it in for him, and it was they who rallied an angry mob and railroaded Christ into death.Overall, this is an excellent film... technically and dramatically.  Kudos to the cast, director, and crew!",The Passion of the Christ

I am not religious by any standards but this movie is an absolute work of art and genius. All aspects of this film is beautiful. It is obvious that so much sweat and blood went into it and the end product is beautiful. I often wondered how could someone make such a well-known story different and new. But this movie is new, refreshing, an amazing. However, this film is not for everyone - when they warn people about it's graphic nature, it's no mere warning - it is graphic, intense and disturbing.

1097,agm1111,The Suffering of the Christ,10,25 February 2004,"This movie is ground-breaking for a number of reasons. Hollywood seems to love it's 'blood and guts' - but only when it has to do with 'fake' people or situations.The beauty of this movie is that there really was a man named Jesus, who really was scourged and crucified.  The bloody horror of such a method of execution is all but lost on our politically correct society.According to the eye-witness testimony of those men and women who walked with Jesus, he chose to willingly submit to this torturous execution so that every person who believes in Him would escape a far worse fate - the eternal fires of hell.Most of the world knows the story of the Christ - so those reviewers who claim the film doesn't bring the 'message' forward clearly are simply covering their distain for the message itself.Twentieth century Americans could not possibly know the horror of a bloody scourging and crucifixion simply by reading words - or by watching a 'sanitized' version of it.  I think it is a very good thing that all people - especially those who already call themselves ""Christians,"" have an opportunity to finally visualize what may have actually took place.  It will give pause to all, but particularly to those who may take their faith in the Christ's vicarious suffering a little lightly.Go see the film.",The Passion of the Christ
1098,magicmilox,"Painful, haunting, and amazing.",10,26 February 2004,"Most know the story.  Christians know it in and out,and non-believers are in the least familiar with the mythos.  Most know where it begins, and where it ends.  And yet, if you are like me, you cannot help but feel moved and hurt by The Passion of the Christ, a visceral, brutal, and haunting depiction of the last day of Jesus Christ. I must begin by saying I have a newfound respect for Mel Gibson after watching his unflinching and, in many ways, unforgiving work.  In a way, he has taken up his own metaphorical cross by putting his professional neck on the line.  I would say that by putting his beliefs on the table for the world to dissect and, in the case of many, mock, he would be in danger of committing career suicide, especially in this day and age in which anything smacking of religion or spirituality is frowned upon by an ever more secularized society.  Were this some self-righteous, paternalistic drivel, I would say that this would be Mr. Gibson's swan song.  His dedication, however, and intense devotion literally bleed from the celluloid.  This movie, rather than being so much self-congratulatory Oscar-fodder, is so obviously a labor of love, one cannot help but be mesmerized from the opening scenes until its understated yet powerful end. Much has been made of Passion's graphic depiction of violence and, indeed, if the MPAA would not give this movie an NC-17 rating for violence, I truly believe we will not see any movie this generation merit such a rating for violence alone.  While the gritty and disturbing depictions of violence against Jesus are difficult to watch, these acts are not gratuitous.  It is frank.  It is blunt.  It is hard and unforgiving, yet very necessary.  The suffering of Christ is central to any discussion on the beliefs of Christianity, and this movie makes that tremendous suffering very real, and very, very poignant.  Make no mistake, however, in many ways this film is not a tear jerker.  No doubt many adherents to Christianity will be moved to tears, but I would not be surprised to see just as many shocked into silence by the suffering on the screen. Accusations of anti-semetism have been flung around nearly as much as the controversial violence, and from my perspective at least, this is completely unfounded.  Yes, some of the Jews are portrayed as bloodthirsty, unsavory characters, but what was burned in my mind as I left the theater was the brutality of the Roman soldiers.  Perhaps Pilate gets a bit of a fair shake, but I am no theologian.  If this was anti-semetic propaganda, then Mr. Gibson should have been a little more overt about it.  If it was there, it was completely lost on me. A movie like this is great cinema.  It challenges the audience, it will no doubt continue to spark debate, and it brings to the table a new retelling of a story that is central to millions around the world.  For the most part it is faithful to its source material.  Of course liberties are taken, with a Satan-figure that, as far as memory serves, is not found in the Biblical accounts, and a soundtrack that occasionally seems a little too `Braveheart' with its dramatic pounding of drums.  All things considered, this is the best film released yet this year, and one I would recommend to everyone, believers and non-believers alike.  Everyone, that is, over the age of 17.",The Passion of the Christ
1099,axidentprone2002,2 stars,1,29 February 2004,"I was bored out of my mind from Scene One.  I give it a two for having a cute leopard in it.  In one word, the movie was simply dull.  Although the story is familiar to most people, that doesn't mean it can get away with having no character development, no tension, no plot.  They just find Jesus and kill him, that's it.  It wasn't even that gory, I don't know what the big fuss is about a bunch of scratches.  Everyone is saying that it's the most graphic, violent movie that they've ever seen... All I can do is roll my eyes to them, they must not see very many movies. What really slowed the movie down was the walk- he fell down at least 5 times and got slower every time.  Slow motion is fine for emphasis but there is a line to be crossed marked ""overkill"" and Gibson crossed it several times.",The Passion of the Christ

If somebody says ""too much violence"" or ""too many bloody scenes"" - just ignore it. This is an essential way to show the depth of humankind fall into sin and is absolutely necessary for people to understand what is really happening in front of them.I hope that we just witnessed the birth of a Hollywood alternative.

1101,the_incredible_kevin,I just don't see the point...,4,17 April 2004,"I understand that this movie is important. I understand that it is groundbreaking in its ""graphic depiction of the final hours of Jesus Christ"". What I don't understand is the alleged power that this movie has. People have claimed that this movie has made them realize the flaws in their lives and made themselves want to be better christians, but I fail to see the religious enlightenment that comes from watching what is essentially a two-hour snuff film. While watching this movie I was moved by its brashness and intense violence, but it was no more uncomfortable or upset than I would feel at any point during any movie where the lead character is put through hell. I understand that Jesus was a real person who changed the lives of many and supposedly died for our sins, but this movie does not put those events into perspective. The beating that Jesus Christ takes in this movie would kill any human being, Mel Gibson has shown that Christ's will was truly strong and he knew what he had to do. This, however, teaches the viewer nothing in the way of christianity, it merely rehashes what is spoken of in churches every year. Granted, this is an adequate visual representation of a Passion play, but the excessive violence does little to further the message of the movie, other than putting the viewers off food for awhile. It is much more important to know what Christ did during his life than to focus merely on his death. I was disappointed. (3/10)",The Passion of the Christ
1102,elchicho25,Nice Cinematography,2,27 February 2005,"What was suppose to make this movie sooo special? Aramaic? Latin? the TRUE account of His death (in every detail)? The script wasn't natural..The Romans and some Jews were more Cartoon-villain-isque than Believable... Whats the point of an Aramaic/Latin soundtrack if your going to be using Anglo actors???? No PLot, Over exaggerated and shoved-down-your-throat effects.. and (aside from Judas, Pilate and Peter) the rest of the actors's performances ranged from nothing-special to terrible. Wouldn't one THINK that the climax to the movie would be His resurrection? (all 5 seconds of it rushed at the end)? Overall I didn't' think much of this ""movie"",... Remember, Just because your a Christian...doesn't mean you its a SIN to not like a Jesus movie. A film of True value in ALL aspects of movie-making based on the life of Christ is ""Jesus of Nazareth"", everything about it (acting, music, script, direction, flow, etc) was Very well done.

But, this movie exceeded my expectations of how accurate it was, and has ""Passion""! this move was a true experience for me as a christian, and put everything into perspective for me. spoken in latin and aramaic made the movie that much more real with the help of great acting, sets, cinematography, and musical score which put you right in the middle of it. all this attributes to trully feeling Jesus' suffing that he endured throughout theses 12 hours. the movie is also extremely emotional, as a lot of people were crying throughout the moving including myself. is the movie for everyone? yes, i believe it is, but for christians it is almost mandatory to experience this film. this film shows Jesus' true passion, the love for every man, woman, and child of the world.

The brutality portrayed in the film does nothing to assist the story in my mind and the amount of blood at one point in the film is just exaggerated to unnecessary extremes. I mean, come on, Jesus may have been a miracle worker, but he was a man just like the rest of us. The film also seemed too glamorous for my liking. Everything was way too cinematic and the other problem was that Gibson seemed to do nothing to justify the violence in the film.

I am certain that the actual events may have been even worse.  I don't think it was violent for the sake of violence.  I wasn't prepared for the way the film portrayed the relationship between Mary and Jesus.  Maia Morgenstern is one hell of an actress (pardon the pun). I could feel the pain she felt in watching her Son suffer.  I was very moved by this.  My husband said he felt guilty saying that he, ""enjoyed"" this film. I think the film was very well made.

1106,campbejp,Sacrifice,10,27 February 2004,"I've been reading allot of these posts, and opinions on this movie.  I myself have seen the movie twice, once in a prescreening about 2 months ago, and once last night opening day.  Both times, I got something new from the film, and was deeply moved, haunted.  This is an extremely impact full film. I recommend this experience to all.That said, I have a response to the expressions from allot of posters and reviews about the film being too violent, or bloody without purpose.  Or un-necessary violence, so much that the point is lost.  That its empty, and without meaning because of the graphic content.Okay, yes this film is violent, and graphic.  So are films such as Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Schindler's List.  Which, In my opinion very violent, Private Ryan possibly more violent than The Passion Of The Christ. What all these historical films communicate is sacrifice.  After watching Private Ryan, I wanted to thank every war vet I saw and knew for the sacrifice, and service paid for the freedoms I enjoy.  After Black Hawk Down, I wanted to thank every service person I know for protecting freedoms, and for serving our country.  It was because the films about these events portrayed them with such realism, such violence that it impacted me, made me see the sacrifice made for the things I have come to take for granted or, enjoy.  The war films I speak of here, didn't pull too many punches as to the violent details of war.  They are graphic, and use graphic details to communicate the suffering, and sacrifice.  It impacts the viewer.  These films weren't too violent, its what happened.  Same as The Passion Of The Christ wasn't too violent.....its just what happened.
As a believer, this made me want to thank God everyday of my life for sending his son to die for me, to sacrifice his life for me so that I could enjoy eternal life and freedom.  To understand his sacrifice for me.  As a believer, that's what I have to do.  I will never look at communion the same again, the body broken for me...I understand The Passion Of The Christ.",The Passion of the Christ
1107,Alex_L,Filled my heart,10,26 February 2004,"The best film I have ever seen.  I do not rate The Passion of the Christ through the level of entertainment I received, but the accuracy that Mr. Gibson achieved in his quest to get his interpretation across to the audience.  I entered with an empty heart and left with it full.I am not a very religious person, and I never took the ideas of religion seriously, but after viewing this film with a sold out theatre I find myself curious about Christ's life and needing to investigate it more.  I was compelled to see this film immediately, so I purchased tickets for one of the 10pm shows (all 7pm's were sold out) which sold out fast, and waited for over 4 hours at the theatre to enter.  I did not see them after the movie, but the people who were handing out information booklets before hand, I wish to thank greatly.I cannot recommend this film to anyone.. you have to see it on your own will.10+",The Passion of the Christ
1108,tsfogg,Some Christians Can't Get No Satisfaction,8,26 February 2004,"Here's an article I wrote on the film for my school newspaper.""Can't Get No Satisfaction""I borrowed the title of the Rolling Stones' song to title this piece because it reminds me of many of the Christians who are feeling threatened by Mel Gibson's new movie, `The Passion of the Christ.'  The Accent has published three articles (by my count) about the movie and two of them were very un-`Passionate.'I have so much to say on this subject, I don't know where to begin. Because I'm studying to be a Christian filmmaker, do I confront the idea of not being able to find Christ in a theatre?   Do I confront the religious zealots who bash Hollywood for making `trashy, immoral movies' and then continue to bash Hollywood when it produces an honest account of the pinnacle and cornerstone of Christianity?But then it occurs to me that you, the reader, won't be able to see this article until at least two weeks after the movie opens.  I write this on the eve of Spring Break, the day after I sat down and witnessed the passion of Christ.  So for those of you who are considering boycotting the film, and while it is still fresh in my mind, I want to share my experience in watching the film before it's too late and you miss out on this enriching experience.I was curious (as I'm sure many of you are) as how can one accurately adapt a story from the Bible into a two-hour movie?  Masterfully, it appearsThe film begins in Gethsemane, with Jesus sweating blood (Luke 22:44) and praying that the Father's will is adhered to, not His own (Matthew 26:41). Satan enters and mocks Jesus and His mission.  A snake slithers out from under Satan's robes and is about to strike Jesus when Jesus stamps his foot down, crushing the snake's head (Genesis 3:15).  Judas, a little scared and intimidated by the high priests, accepts thirty pieces of silver for the arrest of Jesus (Mark 14:10).  The disciples flee into the night, John is even seen being pulled out of his robe in his flight (Mark 14:52).  Jesus is taken to the Sanhedrin (Luke 22:54), where we see both Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus object to the council's actions (Luke 23:50-51).It was at this point I realized this film was as anti-Semitic as the New Testament - not at all.Peter denies Jesus three times (Matthew 26:75).  The high priests take Jesus to Pilate's court (Luke 23:1).  Pilate, swayed by his wife's dream (Matthew 27:19) sends Jesus to Herod (Luke 23:7).  Herod finds no fault in Him, so he sends him back to Pilate (Luke 23:11).  Judas, racked with guilt and tormented by inner (and very visual) demons, hangs himself (Matthew 27:5). Pilate, swayed by the masses, releases Barabbas (Matthew 27:20) and has Jesus flogged (John 19:1).  Jesus is then brutally and torturously flogged. He is mocked and spit upon (Matthew 26:67, Matthew 27:29).  They place a rod in his right hand, a crown of thorns on his head, and drape a purple robe over Him, mocking Him as `the King of the Jews' (Matthew 27:29).  He is led to Calvary (John 19:17), though He can't carry His own cross (Mark 15:21). He is nailed to the cross on Golgotha and He dies (John 19:30).  But it's a victorious death.  Not just a release from pain.  He's on the cross, and with His final breath, exclaims `it is accomplished!'  Three days later, He exits the tomb, triumphant (Matthew 12:40).Throughout this timeline of events, we are privy to flashbacks of Jesus' life and teachings (John 14 most notably).  The most liberty was taken with the character of Satan.  Though it is never recorded in the gospels, it is no stretch of the imagination to say that Satan was present on the day Jesus died.  In the movie the role of Satan is played by Rosalinda Celentano. While it may seem strange to cast a female in the role of Satan, it's nothing new to those of us involved in Christian Drama.  She plays a very cunning, sulking Satan who unleashes a foul cry of defeat when Jesus dies on the cross.There are certain `Catholic liberties' that are taken, such as a quick glimpse of the Shroud of Turin, Veronica wiping the brow of Jesus, and a special emphasis on Mary, the mother of Jesus, but they in no way distract from the focus on Christ or change the message of mercy  and sacrifice the cross and this film brings.Instead of slinging mud at past writers and sharers of opinions, I would like to propose a question, in hopes that you might ingest it and regurgitate it amongst your peers:How would you see it done?  The box office report is in.  On opening day, the movie made 26.6 million dollars.  It opened in 3,006 theatres, each theatre averaging $8,835 in ticket sales for `The Passion.'  That means at seven dollars a ticket; in one day 3,794,001 people were able to witness the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus.  How would you take this story to a society that is callous to violence?  How would you take this event to so many people in a single day?  How would you take this story to a people who would rather sit in any theatre, watch any movie, than sit in church?  How would you make the story alive again to a church who has grown callous to the event, so much so that they simply thank Jesus for His sacrifice and move on to our prayers for Aunt Betty's sniffle?It seems the moral of the story should be `Don't judge a movie by its maker, but view it before making outlandish statements about its lack of spirituality.'",The Passion of the Christ
1109,True2332,Chillingly Realistic,8,15 March 2004,"Despite the fact that this movie has so far been praised by its viewers as a dramatic cinematic experience, the newly developed reputation of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST by no means implies that it follows the example of past movies converted from stories and histories that have been released in the past by altering the story or exaggerating the events.THE PASSION, the newest addition to Mel Gibson's honorable producing collection, focuses on one of the most intense events of human history: the capture and crucifixion of Jesus of Nazarath.  Relying on the fact that this is such an important part of many moviegoers' lives, Gibson was able to create a heart-wrenching and chilling account of the memories, persons, and teachings that were involved in Jesus' life, watching those things through his eyes and through those eyes watching him as he fulfills his destiny as the Savior of mankind.But what was so surprising of this film was not the fact that it was able to capture and maintain the audience's attention so well--let's face it, many films can do this with the right writers on hand--but it was the attention paid to critical details.  Watching the first few minutes was evidence enough: the cock's crow, the line and actions executed by Judas when he betrayed his Lord, Mary's dream...  All these things vividly painted the picture the Bible told of.  All the events were clearly depicted and accurately portrayed and this continued throughout.For anyone going to see this film, I must stress just how powerful the script and production has made it.  Especially for those strong in their faith, even for those that are not, this is almost a chilling account of what happened over 2,000 years ago.  Frequent viewers of the film find themselves very touched by it, others enraged, thoughtful, or speaking of how many comments and reactions they witnessed from others in the theater. From every friend and coworker and family member that has seen this film, I have yet to come upon one that says that the room was completely silent with the exception of the movie's audio.  Expect a reaction, expect emotion, and by all means, go see it if you have not already.  If you know the story, you will be thoroughly pleased and impressed with the amount of effort that has been put into this project.  If you do not, it is still one of the most brilliant successes the film industry has seen in the past few years.Like his previous film, Braveheart, THE PASSION is a masterpiece.  Again, director Mel Gibson deserves our sincere and undying praise.",The Passion of the Christ

I wanted to see Hitleresqe jewish cliches of snarling dogs wearing yarmulka's, myself being Jewish I just wanted to confirm what all these advocate groups had been saying.  Boy was I dissapointed, the only anti-semetic element in the whole movie was that poor jew carpenter having the crap beaten out of him.  Man, that's the whole movie: Jesus having 10 pounds of crap beaten out of a 5 pound man.  Then stuffed and beat again.  He had all his crap beat out everywhere, blood all over just brutal and glory... not Kill Bill Glory (Gory) no limbs were severed and nothing comic occured.  Think the Jewish Rocky and the Jewish Fight Club, except only one guy gets beat (the jew).  I bought a ticket to Eurotrip instead of Passion so that this 'anti-semite' wouldn't profit of.

1111,tonkrz,In a word: WOW!!!,10,28 February 2004,"I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this film for many months, and it did not let me down at all.  As a Christian, I was already completely familiar with the events depicted in this film.  What I was not prepared for, however, is how well they were portrayed.  I believe this film will leave an indelible impression on anyone who sees it.This film struck me on two levels: the spiritual implications and that cinematic excellenceThe spiritual implications mostly speak for themselves.  The viewer spends two hours being brought face to face with the evil of mankind, not just those that were there, but also those of us that are here now.  Throughout those two hours, we are shown time and again the tremendous compassion and restraint necessary for Jesus to withstand our punishment.  If anyone can leave the theater without at least thinking about what it all means, I can't imagine how.The cinematic effort put into this film is astonishing.  The effects were done so well, it was more like experiencing it than watching it.  When the Romans scourged Jesus, I felt as though I was in the crowd witnessing it myself.  I found myself forgetting I was watching an artistic presentation and not the actual events.James Caviezel is phenomenal in the role of Jesus.  He carries out the compassion and kindness of Christ in an overwhelmingly convincing manner. Although he spends a lot of the movie in silence, he conveys volumes with his expressions and demeanor.  The cast of characters that surround him throughout the movie is equally talented.If you've heard this film is extremely graphic is its portrayal of torture and gore, believe it.  The visual affects and make-up were superb - to the point that it looked completely real.  This film does not have the quickly panned shots of the gore seen in many films.  Even with sustained focus, the wounds appear real.If you're wondering whether to see this movie - I give a resounding YES! NO ONE should miss out on seeing it.  It was a terrific movie, and I'm glad I've seen it, but I'm not likely to want to see it again any time soon.  I think it would just be overwhelming.",The Passion of the Christ

1114,bchelrprty,Perfection *spoiler*,10,25 February 2004,"This is easily the best movie of the last 20 years.  Not only is it the best movie regarding the life of Jesus, it is quite possibly the best film ever. Mel Gibson's portrayal of the final day of Jesus' life comes straight from the scripture.  Critics of the film say that the film is too violent.  I say that is a bunch of bunk.  Jesus' death was a gruelling, painful, intense event.  Mel Gibson would have been doing an injustice to all of the viewers of this film if he had tuned down the violence.  If you think the death of Jesus wasn't a violent event, than may God have mercy on your soul.  To the other critics who claim that this movie was antisemitic, I say fie to you. The Jewish community at the turn of the millennium was responsible for the death of Jesus, but that was only because that was God's plan.  No Christian in his right mind would blame the Jews for the death of Jesus, and for the media to assume that Gibson was blaming the Jews is just another sign of the media's contempt for Christians the world over.Now, to the movie.  The portrayal of James Caviezel as Jesus was flawless. Makeup was flawless, the imagery was flawless.  I applaud the hair and make up crew for their efforts.  While the beatings that Jesus endured in the movie were tough to watch, I'm sure they still do not hold water to the actual beating that the Messiah endured 2000 years ago, but Gibson got as close as I've ever seen.  Gibson's idea of the moments immediately following Jesus' death were also top notch.  Being able to see an empty Hell following the rising of all the souls in Hell to Heaven was beautiful shot and directed.  As an afterthought, the fact that the movie's spoken words were in Latin and ancient Hebrew took nothing away from the movie's power and intensity.  Do not let this be a reason for you not to see this film.Overall, on a scale of 10, this movie is well into the 30's.  I would rate is a 33.  It is easily the best film of the last twenty years, and the best film on the life of Jesus ever created.  I applaud you Mel Gibson.  Your film has touched my life.",The Passion of the Christ
1115,sweety2011,an honest review about this controversial film,10,8 June 2011,"it seems as many reviews on here aren't reviewing the film but are reviewing it's topic, which depicts the last days of Jesus, and therefore there are different opinions based on their religious or non-religious views, or based on the brutality in which this film portrays the crucifixion of Jesus like they think it is trying to brainwash the viewers into becoming a believer/Christian. this film isn't about any of that.it attempts to be different than other films about Jesus in its portrayal, as others depict his life in English, a language not used amongst them, and using whips as scourging rather than a Roman flagrum, which is similar to using a cat o' nine tail. as great there have been films to illustrate Jesus' life, such films as Jesus Christ Superstar, The Gospel According to St. Matthew, The Greatest Story Ever Told, Jesus of Nazareth, The Messiah, Jesus (with Jeremy Sisto), to name a few, they never went to such lengths as this film went. is this film better for it? that's debatable, but something I am in favour of, and here's why..I went to view this film with my sisters as soon as it hit the theaters here, despite my mother's disapproval. she had heard of the woman who had a heart attack and died, at the scene of Jesus' scourging, and has never seen this film as a result. when viewing the film, one can see why. some scenes are hard to take. Mel Gibson went through quite an effort to research the Aramaic language, one that has been lost for quite some time, and it's understandable that someone would think it not accurate. however, no other filmmaker has attempted this, and at the same time, a film that also features Hebrew and Latin combined, as the languages were at the time with the Jews and Romans. as mentioned earlier, the film also uses the Roman flagrum, and that's where the brutal scene is. we see skin falling of James Caviezel's back when they scourge him, and with that, a lot of blood. it's a hard watch, but a realistic one at that. along with this, we also see sightings of the devil as told in the bible, and the events of Judas after he wants to take back what he said, which after the refusal, it is said that he went crazy, started to see things, and hanged himself. the film shows he being tormented by the children, and we also see him hanging himself to the point he is hanging. the scene that impacted on me the most is when Mary (Maia Morgenstern) and Mary Magdalen (Monica Bellucci) are left to clean up Jesus' blood. for me, that was the hardest watch, as I truly felt sympathy for Jesus' mother, and was drawn to tears. I didn't know if it was just me crying at that scene, but as I looked around the room, I did not see anyone who was not crying. everything else in the film, it didn't affect me because I was prepared for it. James Caviezel is great as Jesus, and I rather liked the performance Hristo Shopov gave of Pontius Pilate, and Giacinto Ferro gave of Joseph of Arimathea, and that of John and Peter (Christo Jivkov and Francesco De Vito). the overall cast were quite perfect for their roles really.For me, this film is a true gem, and it's one that is loved by my dad, my sisters and I alike. so much so, that since its release in 2004, we haven't missed a year of viewing this film, as it is a film we watch every good Friday. I especially love it because it skips right to the final days, rather than retells Jesus' life, as that does get repetitive-seen it all before. Finally a film that is brave enough to go that extra mile.",The Passion of the Christ

It respected the fact that, though we were in the theatre to witness the the true depth of the violence, we were not there to be tortured ourselves.Schindler's list made me cry.

People seem to be mistaking a realistic portrayal of Christ's condemnation and crucifixion with a good film. All this film seems to be saying is, ""You think it's no big deal that Jesus died for you?  Then watch and see what he went through!"". Best I can say is the cinematography was good.

It was very well acted, particularly by  James Caviezel as Jesus and Maia Morgenstern as Mary.  It seems to me that people are going on about the violence and brutality depicted but I thought the point was to show what Jesus went through for mankind.

It is an appalling movie, which to me completely misses the point of Christ.This is simply two hours of terrible gore where Jesus is beaten, whipped, stabbed and crucified and completely misses the point that Jesus came down to earth fully aware of his eventual sacrifice, for it was an act of love to redeem human sin. This film simply focuses on pain and gore (which were admittedly terrible), as these are more shocking and dramatic qualities in the eyes of Gibson.Furthermore it offends me that a human actor should try and reenact the pain of Christ, a pain far beyond the reaches of humanity, and it verges on blasphemy in my opinion.The anti-Semitic elements of the film are also particularly poor.Please do not watch this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
1121,dweis007,A Failed Movie,4,4 April 2004,"Any film or work of art is implicitly obliged to be an independent piece. This is not to say that one cannot or should not look to other sources for elaboration or articulation. For example, it is often fulfilling to become familiar with the complete works of a director in order to appreciate any particular film, whereby one can recognize and respect patterns and related knowledge. However, any given piece must be a complete work in and of itself. Whereas most retellings of the life of Jesus present a narrative depicting his life, as the Gospels relate, The Passion failed to present any such narrative. The film begins with the arrest of Jesus, a character with whom an unitiated viewer (read ""not Christian"") will be completely unfamiliar. From here, the film detailedly depicts the interaction of Jesus with Pilate, his prolonged torture, his crucifixion, and ultimately his resurrection. Yet throughout this arc, the film presents practically no conception of who this man is. There are a few brief flashbacks to moments in his life which give the viewer the idea that he is a decent man, a carpenter who loves his mother. Aside from this, one does not garner much information or emotional attachment to the man being beaten. He is effectively an anonymous Jew being graphically tortured throughout much of film. This torture, furthermore, is so prolonged and detailed that one loses interest in its severity--there's only so much scouring that one can watch and still be impressed by it. Thus, the film presented to me an anonymous, dimensionless character being between monotonously--hardly an interesting premise.To the film's credit, there were moments of exceptional cinematography and solid acting, but they hardly makeup for the deficits in its foundation--the story.I assume the majority of people who were terrifically moved by and enamored of this film are practicing Christians. That is perfectly fine, except that their knowledge of the Bible and feeling of a personal relationship with Jesus define their interaction with and apprehension of the film. Thus, the film is essentially reliant upon a knowledge of, interest in, and concern for Jesus from its viewing audience as they enter the theater. This is why I consider the film to be a failure. It is only successful insofar as its viewers have a pre-existing love for the story which is presented. As acknowledged above, the film is not within technical merit--it looks as good as the filmmakers could have hoped. But it is fundamentally unsatisfying in that The Passion practically conveys no narrative, deft character study, or emotional content. It is a lame and tedious visual exercise, not a story of merit unto itself.  5/10",The Passion of the Christ
1122,michelle-146,Full of passion,10,15 April 2004,"An incredible cinematic experience.  Very hard to watch yet impossible to look away from.  Jim Caviezal brings a humanity to Jesus that brings the viewer to his pain and finally makes a biblical event feel real.Mel Gibson's long time passion project is worthy of its mass following and another blow to the lack of quality films made by Hollywood.  I'm sure they will find a way to spin it into something negative.The biggest trick had to be that we all know what occurs in this story and yet somehow it all feels very fresh and happening in the moment.  I cannot imagine the pain and agony Mr. Caviezal must have endured for this role.

1123,JNM_Fearless,"This was an experience, not just a film...",10,26 February 2004,"I just got back from seeing The Passion of the Christ. I saw it with my brother and his wife. I have waited for over a year for this film to finally come out. When it was over we just sat there until the screen went black. We hardly said a word on the 30-minute drive home. The scenes that we saw will be forever etched in my heart, soul, and memory. Yes it was gory and gruesome, but I don't need to make an argument to justify why. I have heard the story so many times throughout my life, but I have been desensitized to the reality of it since I was a child. We all have. The words that were read to me out of the bible had no way of penetrating my heart and soul in the way that this film did. It changed my life. It changed my reality. I could go on and on about the power of this film, but I would do it no justice with my petty words. If I could, I would make everyone see it, but it is only powerful to those that believe it to be truth. To all others, it is just another movie. I believe beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it is much, much more than that. It is a window into the last 12 hours of the life of a real man, made of flesh and blood, that I believe to be our savior. I have never felt the reality of that so strongly before tonight. This is not a film, it is not art, it is not one man's labor of love, it is not about religion, it is not a story from a controversial book, it is not a fairy tail, it is reality in a way that you have never known before. I pray that this reality will never leave my heart and that I will be forever impacted by its power. This truly was The Passion of the Christ.",The Passion of the Christ

Whether you are a believer or not, this is a must see. It's hard to talk after.  It's hard to take your mind off it for more than 30 seconds.  It's so powerful it will demand your respect if not your repentence.  Gibson has made this movie so real with the scenes and languages and everything else it feels like you are right there witnessing the biggest event in human history.  I'll be going to see it again, and I'll be buying it the day it comes out.  Don't buy too much food before it starts because you won't feel like eating.

1125,jws261,Dangerous and gross portrayal,4,29 February 2004,"So when does the church plan on making Pontius Pilate a saint?  Known as one of the most evil men ever, Gibson makes Pilate look like Jesus' best friend in this film, while portraying the Jews as a bloodthirsty, unforgiving mob.  Regardless of whether or not Gibson meant to be anti-semitic, that's how the movie came across.  Despite the Catholic Church's statement about 50 years ago that the Jews were not being responsible for Jesus' death, this movie is sure to fan the flames of anti-semitism.  While intelligent people will realize this movie is historically inaccurate, it's the more ignorant people I'm afraid of.  I can imagine a filthy red neck right now sitting in his rocking chair on his porch, shotgun in hand, saying to himself, ""Dang, dem Jews done killed my lawd.  Come on Cletus!  We need to be rounding up some kykes."" Back to the movie.  If Mel Gibson wanted to create a spiritual movie, why would he use a part of Jesus' life where he doesn't preach anything?  Someone who knows nothing about Jesus would not be enlightened in any way by this film.  The few flashbacks to earlier in his life do not satisfy the spiritualness that Gibson claimed he wanted to show. Instead, we see a man getting beaten beyond recognition.  Maybe Gibson just wanted to make another violent movie that would bring people to the theatres, ala ""Braveheart.""",The Passion of the Christ

Don't get me wrong, I am a reasonably devout Catholic, so the story of Jesus hits me close to heart, and I have always been interested in the historical aspects of it, but this film just didn't do it. It was so gruesome it was distracting, and I realize this is how it must have been so I am not going to criticize that part of it, but the thing that really bothered me was that it lacked layers. It was flat, it was just a live, violent version of one of those biblical cartoons they show young kids. It didn't show me anything new, it was stereotypical, and all of the emotion was the same, there was no depth. I did not feel connected to the suffering like I am supposed to. It was just spiritually void. And wow did it make the Jews look horrible, I mean it is historical but this movie really stuck it to them.

1127,Diplomat1983,A Bloody Beauty!!!,9,27 March 2004,"Hello. I have never seen a film like this before. It left me thinking for hours after it was finished. I am not a religious man and do not have much knowledge of what really happened but this film draws a good picture for you. You do not have to be a catholic or a believer to understand and enjoy this film but it may be said that the more you believe the more you are moved. This film was an emotional and powerful masterpiece and i can honestly say that this was one of the best films I have seen. I try to be open minded about things and think maybe it was only moving and powerful because of the gore, and almost the entire film is based on gore but I look past that and can say that everything about this film was good. Acting was unbelievably amazing. The Aramaic language made the film so realistic that you are sucked in right from the start and cannot stop watching however bloody and violent it was. I thought irreversible was bad!!! Each strike on Jesus is like a strike on you as you are watching. I was quite tense most the way through the film and do admit I was very relieved when the film cooled down at times. But i just couldn't look away. As well as it being emotional and powerful it was also very interesting.Thank you very much,Afollabi El-Sheikh Al Noor Mohammed",The Passion of the Christ
1128,Your_Majesty,One word to describe this film: Brutal.(Spoilers),8,3 March 2004,"Wow! I can't beleive how Jesus still survived after all those gory and brutal beatings before he was crucified.  This movie contained LOTS of gore. It's the type of movie you should simply NOT bring your kids to see.I was so shocked and amazed at how they treated Jesus.  This movie was basically two and a half hours beating the living hell out of this man! Again, I strongly recommend, do NOT bring any kids to see this movie!There was this one scene where he was tied onto this small platform, and these two bodyguards started to whack him in the back with these huge sticks.  After about 10 hits, they started to pursue beating the s**t out of Jesus with a stick that had sharp spikes on the edges.  After they were done with his back, they decided to do the same on his chest.  After about 20 hits later, Jesus was literally beaten to a pulp. I was amazed he could still talk.  I thought he'd be dead.Also, the scene where Jesus carries the crucifix to the top of the mountain was pretty sad and disturbing.  I felt sorry for him, the way the guards where whipping him and telling him to move.  You would almost feel sympathy for the poor man.Finally, the ending where he was crucified was dramatic.  I thought the grossest part was when the guards were nailing his feet and hands onto the cross.  You can see the blood squirt out of his hands and feet and I thought that was a little too gory.Overall, great movie!  I give it a 9/10 (Just because there was too MUCH gore).

1129,joshualieder2004,Red Dot Review - Thanks but I've seen better.,6,29 February 2004,"Mel Gibson, I commend you on making a film about Jesus the Christ and his passionate sacrifice for all mankind, but for those reading this brief review, your movie is simply NOT the best film about Jesus. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN is better and is being widely shown down south in theaters.Gibson's film had moments of great power, but he also utilized artistic license, NOT TO MENTION SOME ODD SUBLIMINAL RED DOTS, on the faces of the saints - which for me, detracted from the film.  I enjoyed the Garden of Gethsemane scene the best but found myself focusing in upon Gibson's cinematic choices (notably some odd scenes with the devil and a fixation of Simon who seemed to carry the cross longer than Jesus did!)The film is worth seeing and I do recommend bringing something to wipe your eyes with, but if you want a fuller picture on film look online for a copy of THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (I don't have anything to do with promoting this better film apart from loving movies that feature Christ and wishing I lived down south to see this better film in a movie theater with others.)Mr. Gibson is commended for bringing the film to light (yes I used light deliberately) but his artistic choices in the film do have you going ""Huh?"" a few times.  Read up on who crushes the head of the snake in Genesis and you might enjoy the film more. Also, I think the antichrist makes an appearance in the film but that's just speculation.Gibson got one thing right and it resounded clearly - Jesus died for us all and laid down his own life - forgiving those who spit on him, abused/scourged him, and ultimately facilitated his earthly demise.  I'm not Catholic but the scenes with Mary were especially touching.  A few more flashbacks would have improved the film and I was thankful to be spared the worse real brutality...but what was there was bad enough.Finally, I keep looking for plausible explanation for the oddly placed flashed red dots placed physically on some of the characters faces in the film (and in my mind its got nothing to do with copyright protection as some have forwarded elsewhere in other forums...but more about marking the film subliminally in some way.)  To me it seemed Mr. Gibson was marking the saints in some subliminal way...but to what end?  Only he knows.Overall, worth seeing but not the best.  Southerners must be enjoying the more encouraging, uplifting, just as powerful, different film in their region - but up in Rhode Island I was glad to see Jesus portrayed on film finally...hip hip hooray!",The Passion of the Christ

1131,ruel2,A Masterpiece,10,18 March 2004,"Thank you Mr. Gibson for this film, which makes me think of how little did I know about what Jesus had to endure during His final moments on earth. I'm awed by the power of this medium we all call movies. You deserve pure accolades and not pelting from critics who like to turn a blind eye on the real message of this movie. What a shame... I don't see any anti-semitism in the movie at all. Why can't detractors accept the fact this movie is about a Jew and His last 12 hours. I went to the movie because I felt this is a good way of seeing Mel's interpretation of Christ's death. It made me curious about the Bible once again. Even if I don't get my hands on a Bible soon, at least the intention is there. Why some people in the Jewish community think that this is a movie against Jews is beyond me. Being an ex-seminarian I was taught that The Old Testament is a book about 'The Hand' of God, where it teaches us about God's setting down the law, thereby using a heavy hand at times to enforce His will. Now The New Testament is about Love. And The Passion never omitted this important part of Christ's teaching - to love your enemy. The portrayal of 'some' Jews aiding in the crucifixion of Christ is a fact and it's just too bad that people have the tendency to generalize this. Why not generalize on the fact that Jesus died for ALL of mankind, not just christians, arabs, hindus, jews etc...So all you critics who are making a big mistake of thrashing this film about Christ are actually the ones acting Anti-Christians. But I won't hate you, in fact I will hold true to ""The Teaching"" - I'll love you more. More power to you and your family Mr. Gibson!",The Passion of the Christ
1132,ruel2,A Masterpiece,10,19 March 2004,"My Congratulations to Mr. Gibson for effectively giving us a visual account of Christ's greatest act as a man. Even greater than all His  miracles combined - His death on the Cross for MY sins, Your sins, ALL of mankind's sins. It is I that killed Him, You that killed Him, ALL of mankind that killed Him. People of Christian persuation must know this. Could we be more understanding and respect the purpose of Christ's death. The only ulterior motive that I see this film has is to try to make the the audience a star-witness to the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ as a man. A no-holds-barred witness account of Christ's ordeal. Others have tried telling the story, but never has a film as candid and blunt as The Passion. Although this movie is short on Christ's teachings, it didn't miss to include Christ's most important teaching of all. A selfless kind love, to 'love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you'. This movie has given me a kind of spiritual renewal to my faith. It made me visually remember the pains and sufferings of Christ before He died. It made me unabashedly cry during mother and son scenes, my whole body tensed up upon seeing the skin getting dented with every lash of the stick and flesh getting ripped out of Jesus' side He received a brutal scourging from the sadistic drunken Centurions. This movie made you a participant of the whole ordeal. A moving experience in toto. It can drain you both emotionally and physically - all you do is to sit still and watch. This movie is not for everyone. People who bring malice in their hearts to the movies will come out worse, because they will be blind to the real meaning of the film. It is also a possibility that they will incense their imagination and unjustly thrash the movie, thereby turning a blind eye on the artistic merit of the film, if not for its significance to a Christian like me and people who just like to see a great movie about a Jew who made a difference.

The movie had basically everything the bible said.  The scenes are to the extreme... definitely an R-rated feature.  The movie made you feel like you were actually there to witness Jesus' torture.  The way the Jews and the Romans were displayed was magnificent... definitely good acting.  The movie was so touching, it actually made a person cry... and believe me when I say this. People ACTUALLY came out of the theater crying after the feature was over! And I must admit, this movie did get me.  Some scenes actually made me WANT to cry.

1134,jehovahdictator,An atheist's view,4,29 February 2004,"I was highly disappointed by this film.  The story of Christ, even seen through secular eyes, should be a moving tale.  A man so loved the rest of mankind, he gave his life for it.  Even in this light the movie should have moved me.  Instead, it left me wishing i was somewhere else.  I was never even close to feeling compassion for Jesus in this movie, and that is a major reason I believe Gibson failed to make a good movie.  I don't know why, but I was impartial to what was happening.  I feel sorrow for the actual Jesus because he suffered so much.  This portrayal of Jesus left me feeling nothing.  The violence was over-the-top, but not in a gory sense. If that level of torture were inflicted on Jesus, a human, then he would not have survived to be crucified.  While I saw no overt anti-Semitism, the Jewish leaders seemed to be too cruel and Pilate seemed weak and easily manipulated.  This situation could have been handled better.  Also, the flashback scenes were oddly edited in.  They needed an indicator to say it was a flashback.  A positive is the use of Aramaic and Latin, a very nice touch.  I rated this movie a 4/10, which still doesn't qualify it as a ""watch it to say you have"" on my scale.",The Passion of the Christ

The story of Jesus Christ's has never been told better.First the charges of anti-semitism are bunk. If you think the passion of the Christ is anti-semitic then all four gospels are also.
The charges of the violence being over done is also false. It is realistic as to what was known to happen to prisoners of rome in first century Judea.Do not take kids under then 12 to see it. And only take kids 12-14 if they have been exposed to the story and allready understand the horriable details of Christ's death.Now, as a Christian I wanted to scream at the people on the screen. When Jesus is being whipped I had to restrain my self from screaming ""Stop, you don't know who you are whipping."" and ""stop enjoying this.""

1138,jpii_99,WOW! The most brilliant film on Jesus Christ yet!,10,26 February 2004,"This movie experience goes beyond ANY I've ever seen. The whole acting ensemble/portrayal of the historical figures involved were perfect, and Mel's vision was brilliant. I never cry over movies yet, I had tears throughout many parts of this beautiful film. I'm still in awe, esp. by the little details, like the drops of blood Jesus experienced in the Agony of the Garden, Veronica's Veil, Jesus as a carpenter (a scene which relates to the Last Supper), more.The audience was mixed with Christians/non-believers. All were silent throughout and after, no eating/drinking did I hear, just tears (how could we not?)Yes, there are parts that are gruesome (after all Jesus DID suffer unimaginable persecution/death, esp. being innocent, that no others experienced during that time--crucifixions did not include a crown of thorns, whipped to a pulp then beat up afterward, spit on, mocked, whipped again continuously while carrying his cross to his crucifixion, and more). However, these parts of the film are disrupted with flashbacks of Jesus' ministry, Last Supper, childhood, as a carpenter, etc. to reiterate why Jesus chose to suffer for us. They make the violent scenes easier to accept, IMO.This movie is based on the Gospels (the Bible does say not everything Jesus did in his life is recorded, so there is Oral Tradition and other early written works that help prove what happened to Jesus is True). Jesus' death was brutal because the Romans were in charge of carrying out the Crucifixion (brutality was part of that regime as they were brutal to Christians for many years in the Coliseums). Thus, the Roman leaders were equally responsible for condemning Jesus to an unjust death.There is no anti-semitism in this film. Jewish Leaders (esp. Caphias) were threatened by the growing followers of Jesus-also a Jew, so they condemned him to death. Jewish leader, Joseph of Aramethia, did try to defend Jesus but was forced to leave the trial by the crowd. When the crowd was faced with the decision to choose to free Jesus or Barabbas (a murderer), the Jewish Leaders provoked the crowd to choose Barabbas. The Jews who were against it were beaten and silenced by the Romans/the crowd. Jewish figures who supported Jesus are present and powerful throughout the film.I highly recommend seeing ""The Passion"", esp if you're a Christian because being transported to that time/event helps you understand/appreciate your faith. I plan to see this movie again in a few weeks. I'm not afraid to re-witness the brutality that was bestowed on this Great Man because I know His love for me is why He CHOSE to suffer for my sins. And, it allows me to reflect on the purpose of Lent...""The Passion of the Christ"", which leads up to the Resurrection. Without the ""Passion"" there is no ""Resurrection"".Before allowing naysayer critics to make up your mind about this movie, experience it yourself. There is much artistic value in this film.I give this film a whopping 10 Stars!",The Passion of the Christ

The first scene of the movie is amazing lightingwise.Casting was wonderful. In fact, all of the things that one would write about in a movie review were 100% perfect... plot, casting, acting, storyline, effects, etc.As for the debate over it, my advice would be to see it for yourself and form your own opinion.

1140,serge_arslanian,It's all I pictured it to be,10,10 March 2004,"Mel Gibson is a cinematic genius! words cannot explain what you feel when watching this movie, especially if you are a convicted Christian. The casting is superb and James Caviezel doubtlessly will get an Oscar nomination next year. Sure it is violent, gruesome and heart clenching but it only portrays the barbaric nature of men at that age. The flashbacks are great, especially when Jesus falls as a kid, one cannot hold back his/her tears. If one doesn't cry at this movie there is seriously something wrong. Another scene that I loved was the raindrop as it falls down to earth, and then how Gibson portrayed the defeat of Satan. I cannot stop thinking of every part of the movie from the suicide of Judas, to the face of the Christ being imprinted on the white cloth. Even it is in the prophecy that none of the Messiah's bones will not be broken (when the roman soldier drops the hammer in the last part)Finally I have to give it up to Gibson for his courage and conviction to produce such a masterpiece, however this movie is not for the faint of heart and one has to be ready for the rough and violent scenes.

1141,gwcondo,I loved this movie.,9,18 March 2004,"I loved this movie.  My response to criticism I have heard: 1.  The movie is not anti-semitic. First, it was the Romans who tortured Jesus, forced a crown of thorns into his scalp and crucified him.  Second, while it is true that the Jewish clergy and elders forced it, remember that Jesus was a Jew, as were his followers. 2.  I don't think Pilate got off lightly.  His ambivalence was accurately portrayed.  His decision was based on selfish political considerations, nothing more, nothing less. 3.  The violence has turned off some.  Remember, Jesus was scourged, beaten, bound, crowned with thorns, crucified and stabbed.  There is no way to sugarcoat this.  The violence vividly demonstrated the love Jesus had for his people.  He truly did die for our sins. He experienced a horrible death, and he forgave. 4.  I liked the way pure evil is portrayed in the movie.  Yes, Satan was among the Jewish elders.  He was also among the Romans.  Evil is real.A final word on anti-semitism.  I am a Christian.  I believe that the Jews are God's chosen people.  My savior was a Jew. How can I possibly leave this movie and have any animosity towards the Jews?  How can anyone?I applaud Mel Gibson and I thank him.",The Passion of the Christ
1142,thunderfoot75,Unbiased review of an above average film,8,2 April 2004,"I don't doubt at all the power of this film, it is a very powerful picture. What makes me a little puzzled is what was the need to make this film. Everybody knows what happens in this story, everyone knows the outcome. It is an important story to be told but all that Gibson has offered that's fresh is that the film is in Latin and the level of torture and horror has been taken to the uppermost level.  Does Mr Gibson have a thing for eye-watering torture scenes in his films or what...remember the disembowelling scene in Braveheart, or what about the toe popping, hammer scene in Payback (I can't recall whether he directed that).  I like the way that Gibson has depicted satan in this film, very subtle but extremely effective.  All in all, Passion is a pretty good attempt at depicting the events of the criminally unfair trial and brutal crucifiction of Jesus Christ.  The film feels very authentic, probably due to the entire cast speaking in Latin.  I like the fact that Mel has made the film gritty and realistic.  He has captured the right mood.  When I finished viewing the film I felt quite empty.  8/10",The Passion of the Christ
1143,ahvginkel,A personal testimonial,10,9 April 2004,"After seeing The Passion of the Christ, it's not possible for me to give a comment upon the movie itself without reacting to the many other comments, both positive and negative, The Passion has drawn.As a historian, I applauded the way in which the movie was made. There are some incongruities here and there, but picking upon them would be like looking at a painting by noting how many wrinkles were drawn on the nose or how many leather straps a sandal shows. In The Passion, the complete painting matters, and like Jesus scorned the Pharisees for turning over each letter of the Scriptures instead of looking what they are about.... it would be a waste of time to stumble upon little details. This painting is breathtaking, and a cinematographic masterpiece in every way: acting, casting, special effects, script, etc..Now to the comments of others. I dare ask all those who think this movie is too violent: what did you expect, in a time when whole cities were raped, pillaged and slaughtered for nothing? Of course, the Roman army was full of what we would now call, in our ""civilized"" society, emotionally disturbed persons, or just plain crazy. Look at the Roman society to which gladiator games was a great entertainment. Who could wonder about the sadistic way in which many - not all - Romans are depicted in this movie? Accept this fact, it's solidly built upon a myriad of historical evidence.
The Jews in the movie. The way Romans talk about the Jews in this movie, is completely congruent with the writings of Tacitus et al. about themselves and the ""barbaric"" peoples in their empire. Pilate and the Romans must have felt a loathing for the Jews. No wonder that the only time Roman legions destroyed a country, was in AD 70 when they slaughtered Jerusalem. Romans were convinced they brought enlightment to the vanquished peoples, and they couldn't understand the intolerant and arrogant way in which the Jews and the early Christians shoved away the Roman way, the ""pax romana"". They had to be punished for this ""arrogance"", and they were, as everyone knows.But how do rabbinical groups talk about this Jesus of Nazareth? They have enough reason to do so in a negative way, first of all because of the antisemitism they encountered in the Christian world. But the Talmud talks about Jesus in a negative way. To pious Jews, Jesus is a renegade Jew. To the Jews of 2000 years ago, he was even worse, a blasphemer. Blasphemy was to be punished by death, and the Sanhedrin had no other answer to his teachings which run contrary to the Torah scriptures in many, many essential ways.Looking at the facts, it all fits as it is described in this movie. It plays in a cruel world in which compassion was seen as a dangerous weakness. The Jews again massacred one of their prophets, as they have done so earlier. And the Romans were sick of being pushed by a small and arrogant populace. When push came to shove - and these are, again, all historical facts supported by Roman and Hebrew writings - things happened in AD 70 as foretold by this Jesus of Nazareth.I think that the only group complaining about anti-semitism and extreme violence are the persons who shouldn't go and watch this movie. And as for me, as a believing Christian, this movie has changed a lot in my life.
I hold no grudge against Jews or Romans, after seeing the movie. Things happened as they were meant to happen, and the last thing we should do is denying it happened that way without plain counterevidence.
In short: a masterful movie.",The Passion of the Christ
1144,tkguess1,The movie was awesome!,10,25 March 2004,"This movie was awesome! It was well done and made you FEEL what Jesus went through along with people like his mother Mary and even some people that participated in his death. Mel used flashbacks for highlighting reasons and things that were going on. He also went to great lengths in detail, you can even watch Jesus' pupil enlarge as he dies. See the blood on the nails etc. Some people complain of it's graphic detail as if Mel was a gore hound. It is horrible to watch and I have seen most gory movies, but none had you FEELING the pain he felt. It was good thing to show this to show the brutality that he went through for his mission and yet he persevered. People who complain of the graphicness are people who can't face reality. But most of all films that water it down do an injustice to the act because he went through it and some need to be slapped in the face with what he did to understand the difficulty of it and the fact that it was an ultimate sacrifice. Society has become so calloused and desensitized nowadays that a film like this was needed to make them understand, and for those of us who already did, it just marked us deeper with the reality. Go an see it, I don't know how you can watch it and remain unchanged by it somehow. It gives good messages after 911, love one another, and that it is not wrong to stand up for god even when it means your persecution or death. Maybe it will start a bit of harmony and understanding or at least tolerance for all people who worship god. Not to defend those that kill others in his name because he shows an example of gentleness on his part, he killed no one but suffered quietly. Maybe it will help give a minute of tolerance for others. we can only hope. Great movie!",The Passion of the Christ
1145,fergy-7,true to Holy Scripture,10,5 September 2004,"A comment made by another viewer stated that ""terrific"", ""best ever"" are shallow words to describe this movie. I wholeheartedly agree. This movie is not designed to be ""terrific"" or a ""best ever"" movie, but was designed to merely tell the story of the passion (love) that Christ had/has for mankind.The filming was well-done. Many viewers may be sickened by the violence but that was the way it was. Some may find that it is anti-Semetic but it's not against the Jewish people as a people. It merely states that yes, it was the Jewish religious hierarchy that wanted Jesus dead. The Romans were the ones tasked with scourging and flogging Jesus, and yes, they did get carried away -- but isn't that what happens in a 'crowd' mentality? The fact that the movie was in Aramaic with English sub-titles didn't take away from the story at all. Jesus didn't speak English .... He didn't speak Hebrew .. Aramaic was His language and this movie brought that out. Once again...........this is a movie to purchase (it is parallels another favourite of mine ""King of Kings"").",The Passion of the Christ

How come an avowedly liberal, democratic nation like the United Kingdom has this film classified as only suitable for a higher age group than pretty much any other nation in the free world? Not even with parental permission can anyone under the age of eighteen attend a regular ticket-paying screening of this film. Robocop can continue to maim and murder on public TV at a time when under 16's can see the movie, but nailing Jesus to a cross is only available to consenting adults; is that a paradox, or what?",The Passion of the Christ

Wanna see a grown man get absolutely butchered for two hours straight? well then, Mel gibsons ""the passion of the christ"" will be right up your alley. I can almost see mel gibson doing a casting call on this movie: ""No that guy does look jewish enough, he's just doesnt have a hooked nose and he's just not ugly enough, and that guys too handsome to be a jew ... lets make him an Apostle!""For all you Macho guys out there, this movie is a godsend (no pun intended) Not only will you get to see Jesus get his ass kicked in a multitude of ways, you'll get to see enough blood that would make george romero get a hard on.Dont kid yourselves people, this movie isnt about christ, its not even biblicly accurate. its really about Mel gibsons Daddy using his sons money to make a nice little Anti Semitic propoganda movie. And what a thorough Nut job that man is. I wish someone would ask Mels pop what he thinks of 9/11 and jews again. Maybe it could be broadcast like a presidential speech or something. Betcha the BO take wont be full of ""passion"" when that happens.
I cant wait for ""the Passion 2: I've made a crapload of money of the first one so I'm dropping all pretext, Jews are Evil"" and maybe this time instead of two hours worth of torture, Mel can fit in 4 hours worth, cuz it will make it twice as meaningful and holy. Roman: Take that Jesus 2! Jesus 2: No, please no!

And throughout the entire movie, I was crying my eyes out, and so were other girls in my class. Even some boys cried. I cried because of the fact that, those torments actually happened to people thousands of years ago and it is very emotional. Even before the movie started I started to cry. And after the movie I was crying so hard that my religion teacher gave me a hug and comforted me. I'm a very emotional person. Throughout the rest of my school day, everyone was quite and depressed, especially me. This movie will change you and your day. Amazing acting and outstanding directing by Mel Gibson.",The Passion of the Christ
1149,Jordan9282,THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!,10,6 April 2004,"This was the best movie I have ever seen.  Mel Gibson does an awesome job at making this film, despite the critisism and doubts that were clouding his mind.  Everything, as far as the Bible is concerned, is biblically accurate and the severity and brutality of it all is as real as it gets.  A crucifixion is something that was taken lightly.  It has been deemed the most cruel and most horrific kind of punishment that man has ever developed. This movie was so good that you couldn't take your eyes of it.  Mel even does a great job in spreading the violence out so the movie isn't shoving horrific violence down your throat throughout the entire movie.  Plus, I liked the flashbacks that Jesus and Mary had.  They really complete the movie.  This is the best account of what really happened that has ever been put to film.  This movie just completely blows your mind away and what's the best part. . .It actually happened.  That's the love of Jesus for you.",The Passion of the Christ
1150,n4nobody,for best results watch alone,10,9 April 2004,"Good Friday 2004: Now this is most definitely a film that can be called a masterpiece. We all have our personal opinions, religious and cultural beliefs and upbringings. If we push these aside and see this film as a piece of art there is no question that its caliber is right up there. Gibson goes straight into the ordeal of Christ and the tense and highly emotional atmosphere is held pretty much all the way through, subtly and welcomingly alleviated with flashbacks of other, well known and relevant facts of Jesus' life, cleverly triggered and slipped into by associating scenes. Gibson, using the fact that most of us already know the story of Christ, also sticks in some strong analogies  such as the last supper, and the bread and wine being his body and blood.While the torture scenes can be quite horrific and ruthless in their portrayal they are most definitely believable. We have had worse on cinema, for example those that leave it up to our own imagination.
All the major characters were superb and sensitively developed. Each expression of each character well thought out. They say nothing is worse than for a mother to have their child die before they do. By not being portrayed as hysterical (it seems like she is beyond hysteria) Mary's suffering is much more powerful and intolerable. The camera shots were excellent and the movement, and bridging between scenes were superb. The music also was perfect and unintrusive. Regarding the subtitles: forgot I was reading them.10 out of 10!",The Passion of the Christ
1151,Lewisshr6lw,Very bad blasphemous splatter movie not worth seeing again,1,4 January 2005,"I am a devout Christian who loves Jesus with all my heart, mind, and soul. I saw this horrible film back in April 2004 and wanted to make my comments. First of all, I believe that Jesus is my Lord and Saviour and that He really existed 2000 years ago. When I went to see this movie with my brother, who is also a Christian, I thought I was going to see a well made movie about Christ's last hours on earth. It was nothing but a blood and gore film. No character development, very bad acting. The decision to have the film in the so-called original languages was sort of stupid to me. In the gospels, when Christ is resurrected, He told his disciples to go out and make followers of ALL NATIONS!!! To me that means that the gospel message should be translated into all languages! I cannot believe the so- called Christians who would give this film a high rating. It is one of the worst films on the life of Christ, ever. The gospels do not go into gory detail on how Christ was scourged or tortured. I do not need to see a gory, gruesome reenactment of Christ scourging. Also this movie is NOT historically accurate, as some would believe. Jesus probably only carried the crossbeam and not the entire cross. Also, He did not get thrown over a bridge and Satan was not in the garden of Gethsemane to torment Him. When His side was pierced, the gospels did not say that blood and water came out like a big shower fountain and drenched a Roman soldier. I could say more, but I was totally sickened by this sorry excuse for a film. I could not sleep for 2 days after watching it. If I had kids, I would NEVER take them to see this crap. Talk about causing nightmares! A film about Christ should be beautiful. At least with the old Jesus movies, they had better acting and character development and you learned something about Christ's teachings. I learned absolutely nothing from this horrible movie. Shame on you Mel Gibson and all of your deluded, ignorant fans who are too lazy and stupid to read their Bibles! I believe that we are living in times similar to that of ancient Rome and the gladiators, where people would get enjoyment at watching someone being whipped and beaten to a bloody pulp.

You will either believe like never before, or you will not believe at all.  It is hard to see anyone sitting on proverbial fence after witnessing this movie.  I looked around the theatre at one point and could not believe how many people, men, women, and children were silently staring and crying at the events being depicted on the screen. At that point, I realized that I was crying also.  I found myself at times, wanting to turn away from the screen.  At first, I couldn't figure out why, because I have seen Slasher films with more blood.  After a few moments of ponder I realized that it was shame.  I know at that point, I started really believing everything that my Sunday school teachers told me when I was growing up.  I felt ashamed, that I could waste what was given me.  Some would say, I'm being stupid or superstitious, but I believe that Mel Gibson was truly inspired to make this movie and had to have a little help from above.  If you doubt what I say, then please, by all means, witness it for yourself.  I believe that miracles do happen still today, and this movie is one of them.",The Passion of the Christ

After me seeing it with my youth group, it changed some of there hearts forever. So many souls were harvested that night. It shows what happened to Christ in a true way that really puts in perspective of what Jesus did for us. It is such a humbling movie. I mean Mel Gibson really nailed it in the way it's supposed to be. Because Jesus wasn't a guy who walked around in his dressing gown with everyone praising him and worshiping him. This is really what this guy went through. He did feel the pain of being betrayed, the people did not show him any mercy. A lot of people said there should have been more talking in it.

1155,bachware,"Superb film, but violence a bit too much",9,5 November 2005,"I had to write a review of this movie because I am a Latter-day Saint (LDS, also known by the nickname ""Mormon"") Christian. Gibson's film is taken from Scripture with some interpolations of his own, but he doesn't develop some side-plots (such as Judas) in depth, but rather focuses on the period of the last 12 hours of Christ's life that Catholics call ""The Passion."" Catholics, and to a certain extent Orthodox, concentrate heavily on this aspect of the Savior's mission, and Gibson being a conservative Catholic, such focus is to be expected.""Mormons"" normally do not go to R-rated movies. I myself agonized about going, but wanted to see if the alleged gratuitousness and anti-Semitism were true. Neither were. The violence was exactly as it was depicted in Scripture. There is often a seeming intent in Catholic art to use gory and violent imagery in order to intensify the feeling of responsibility for Christ's suffering in the viewer, which is supposed to solidify resolve to live worthy of the sacrifice. The noted Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki's Passion According to St. Luke does the exact same thing with music, and with equal excellence. Many other Christian depictions (including LDS Church videos) of the Passion depict the gruesomeness of his sufferings by various degrees of implication  e.g., panning away or focusing in so as to soft-pedal the brutality.Gibson's depiction of the suffering is at times too protracted, but he is trying to make another point: Pilate allegedly remands Christ to Abenader for severe punishment in hopes that the sight of the scarified, nearly dead man will placate the corrupt Jewish leaders and mob, so that Pilate may set him free  not because he believes him innocent or is merciful (yes, the historical Pilate was a monster that allegedly committed suicide in Vienna years afterward, after having been dismissed as procurator). Yet, the level of sympathy for his political dilemma is seen in one of the Gospels, whereas another one paints him mercilessly as a spineless, opportunistic, brutal bureaucrat. On the other hand, his wife Claudia is shown to be an ashamed, caring, sensitive person.Abenader is appalled at the brutality of his subordinates, and the man sitting at the table, and witnessing it, is also obviously disturbed at the Romans who scourge Christ, who are portrayed as brutal thugs, it is true. But, not all of them are portrayed as thuggish beasts.Executioners at this time are like all others: Their brutal profession reduces them to obscene caricatures of human beings, probably as a side effect of psychological defense mechanisms. War does things to people like that. Look at the leering, rejoicing SS Einsatzgruppen troops in ""Schindler's List,"" as they burn the heaps of murdered Jews. To such persons, the victim is objectified and dehumanized, and the person doing the dehumanization is also dehumanized in the process. The brutality in the movie is not just about what the Romans and the Sanhedrin do to Jesus, but about what they do to themselves (self-dehumanization) in the process as well.As to alleged anti-Semitism: Christ was a Jew, as was his mother and almost all of his associates. The Sanhedrin at the time were notoriously corrupt (especially Caiaphas and his father -in-law Annas, who likely saw Christ and his adherents as a threat to their power). Men in the Sanhedrin (probably Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea) who objected to the trumped-up, illegal sham trial of Jesus were cast out of the proceedings. I saw no trace of the anti-Semitism Gibson was accused of. Yes, the New Testament says that they said ""His blood be upon us, and upon our children,"" but that was not the Jewish _people,_ but the Sanhedrin only: Annas, Caiaphas, and the remainder of that corrupt body. The man (Simon of Cyrene) who carried Jesus' cross for him was a Jew. When Simon stumbled, the Roman taunted him with the epithet ""Jew!"" Yes, there were leering, hardened faces of the corrupt Jewish political leaders, but I detected no antipathy toward Jews as an ethnic group in the movie. Those who do are likely inferring what they've been told is there by the media.What disappointed me was that the resurrection was treated in a very cursory manner. It would've been far better to tone down (soft-pedal and shorten) the scourging/crucifixion sequences a bit, and to have included part of the period between the death and the resurrection, and shown the resurrection with a bit more development (Peter and John seeing the empty tomb, Jesus showing himself to Mary Magdalene, etc.), with a more light and hopeful ending to counterbalance the relentless, dark and violent Passion sequence. But, Gibson's intended focus is almost exclusively on the Passion, which is after all the core of the title.Overall, I rate the film on the level of Wyler's ""Ben-Hur,"" de Mille's ""The Ten Commandments,"" Huston's ""The Bible,"" and give it nine stars.",The Passion of the Christ

1157,Silly_Whyte_boye,"""Never discuss Politics and Religion...""",1,11 March 2005,"Okay, so I watch this flick of a man named Jesus being beaten savagely by dudes on a complete and total sadist trip of the most vicious kind! I was told this was an act of Love. This savage sacrifice of God's own begotten son; His miracle baby born to die like a broken beaten down stuck pig, for a God who's nose is out of joint because his original creations practiced the Freedom of Choice the God gave them in the first place. Then like a Republican, this god starts to take the freedom of choice away! What the hell is a free choice when one is severely punished for not choosing the 'right' way...like Russian Roulettewhere is the freedom in this? To the way I was brought up, if this God were personified, I'd make it my life's mission to have this him locked away in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison with minimum contact to the outside world! Well, maybe Charles Manson in a 'birds of a feather' kinda way. And, this God, I feel has a problem; serious anger, sadistic, power tripping issues that desperately need to be addressed! So, I'd allow a therapist and vipassana teacher and three guards ready to give him a taste of his own medicine if he chooses to 'get out of line', or if we have any 'failure to communicate'.Jesus also said, 'You will reap what you sow! What you put out will come back to you up to 150 fold!' Therefore, I feel it is wise to treat others the way one demands being treated! But, very sadly, as their actions speak louder than their words the Republicans have twisted the Golden Rule into: 'Do unto Others Before They Do Unto You'! the karmathe karmathe karmaBut, the thing that I was left with in the end, and now almost a year later, is how little effect this movie had affected the American public, who flocked to see it again and again. I judge not, rather I observe the fruits of their efforts. Two years later we are still fighting a War in Iraq started by US. Yet, Iraq's leader posed zero threat to US. He got rid of the WMD George Bush and Ronald Reagan sold him back in the 80's. And Saddam was a maniacal madman back then which was why these two sold him WMD! What kind of patriot sells WMD to a known tyrannical brutal killer? Today, two years later approx. 15,000 innocent civilians, many are children who have been 'accidentally' killed by US: ""We're sorry""! The Soldiers are just following orders and then, War is hell. So, why is America, a nation founded upon Christian (Christ-like) teachings at War in the first damn place? Jesus Christ is The Prince of Peace. Period. There have been no revisions, nor have their been amendments since George W. Bush, the Christian War President, was sworn into his appointed, then allegedly elected office. Jesus is the example Christians, including American Christians are supposed to be following! He taught, 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despiteful use you, and persecute you; for if you love them which love you, what reward have you? Do not even the republicans the same?'I observe the United States is acting like the 'god' in their bible, when they are supposed to be acting like the his miracle son Jesus Christ: Prince of Peace! I think Jesus said some nutty things like, He was here to change the old laws of the Father like an eye for an eye, to: love your neighbor as you love yourself! So many 'Christian' men have jerked US off; I wonder why they hate gays! However, I don't think that is what was meantThe saddest part of all is hearing the American War president say Jesus Christ is his hero! Then he starts a War over WMD his in country inspectors told him were not there! Then, bares false testimony to justify 'doing to Iraq before Iraq does to US'what Iraq is incapable of doing: Bomb the hell out of a country that never once threatened them! Nor were any Iraqi citizens apart of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 attacks! However, 13 of those hijackers were Saudis. But, the most horrible utterances I have heard coming from a 'man of God' that appalls me the most is Christian Evangelical Reverend Jerry Falwell who said, ""Carpet Bomb the people of Iraq in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ""! while being interviewed by Wolfe Blitzer in October 2004. (NOTE: Jerry F., Jesus Christ is The Prince of Peace! Pray tell, what Jesus are you praying to?)This is what I call republican sense, please follow this analogy: We know the Rapists and murderers (terrorists) live on Elm Street (Saudi Arabia) but we start bombing Lincoln Ave (Iraq) thinking the leader still had the WMD sold to him by US during the 80's! and the real Rapists and murderers getaway with it. And the leaders profit off the war!but one NOT two leaders have no any noble family members in service of our country, but there is one Senator Joe Biden. With 'Christian leadership' of a profiting War President like this, we don't need foreign enemies or terrorists!I think it's great to see Mel Gibson has 'sold out' his Holy Spirit Guided flick 'The Passion of Christ RECUT'. Did the Holy Spirit not know the savage violence would turn some people off and limit its audience? Did the movie not make enough money last spring?

1158,little_lover666,From a Mothers perspective,3,29 September 2004,"It didn't change my life. I watched this film 'hoping' to feel something, and i did. From a Mum's perspective, i cried a little and held my son while he slept. But then i do that often. I love my child and work daily on letting him go to be the person it was intended for him to be... As did Mary. But the movie was just another representation of a story i've heard related before. No more no less. It didn't disturb my outlook on life, nor affect my spirituality. This particular event in history 'just was' because it 'needed to be'. And so be it. And so this movie was (re-)created to remind us of this, and I hope it bought peace and freedom to those who felt it had to be made.... again. From a personal perspective, it's a thought provoking message and i personally care little how many times and in what format it's conveyed... It's one that'll never go away. If it makes one more person realize that the 30 pieces of silver can -never- be returned, then fine. A worthwhile venture in realisation of consequence. But the most important reminder that i get from the story is that JC is me and I am him...with one notable difference. He accepted it. But i can work on it. As a statement on my own expanding belief system, this comment is well and good. As a comment on the movie and it's 'worth', my statement falls silently, and causes not even the merest ripple against the ocean of opinions that will be cast over this piece of artistic representation for some time yet.

Praising the movie as he did, he wrote many words in the defense of the movie; but not a single word about why he thinks it is a good one. To say that the movie describe or give an interpretation of real events, will be nothing but unintelligent. Thus it leaves us with the movie itself, which is dull expected and without a vision. The characters are untrustworthy and the staging is defective. All in all, it is a movie that caught headlines unnecessarily.

1160,ccpuzzler,As for claiming the movie was too violent.....,9,18 July 2006,"I saw ""Christ"" and yes it was disturbing and violent, but you have to remember that Christ's death was disturbing and violent. Many people have commented on the brutality in the depiction of the scourging & Crucifixion. Well, because it was brutal! Hello! This movie, more than any other movie about the life of Christ, perhaps most accurately depicts the savagery of the Romans. The scourge was not a mere whipping, but it was intended to leave the victim in a near-death state. And, of course, being beaten with whips that had pieces of metal tips in the end of them would be enough to do just that. Being nailed to a cross and hung there to die is also a inhumane torture.Many criticize the brutality and violence in this movie, but frankly, it is the closest to historical accuracy we have ever seen. Mel Gibson created an affecting, moving piece of film that has an effect on you both physically and mentally. That is indeed film making.

However, if you like powerful movies, and are not particularly religious (or not at all) this movie is still great. First, no one can deny the impact Christ has had on history, and this film will help you understand why Christians feel the way we do about Him. Also, it was an amazingly artistic movie, the acting was spectacular, the cinematography was breath taking. The soundtrack was also superb. So, Christian or not, see the movie with an open mind and you will love it. It is brutal, hard to take, and disturbing, but I am not sure how to show a crucifixion without all of that. To be honest, I don't think the...brutality of the movie was enough. It should have been more, at least from a literal interpretation of the Bible.Watch it, and you will enjoy it, I promise.",The Passion of the Christ
1162,fmcnulty2003,The one film that gets it right,10,10 March 2005,"I've seen a great number of films on Jesus' life, some good, like Jesus of Nazareth, some downright trash, like Superstar, Godspell, and the King of Clunkers, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ. The good ones illustrate the basic time line of His life and they're nicely acted, photographed, scored, etc., but what I adored about PASSION is not only the refusal to sugar-coat the last twelve hours, but that it took one aspect of His life, the most important aspect of His life, and magnified it, made you feel as if you were living through it with Him, just as if you were Mary Herself. The blood-and-guts was very necessary - people in that region at that time were very uncivilized and it didn't bother them who they were hurting or how badly. It was just ""this one did something we don't like and must pay - with interest"". It was necessary for accuracy. That's why I was not grossed out, that's why I didn't laugh out loud or make fun of it later, as I do with all blood-and-guts movies. This is where true empathy and sympathy are evoked. Apart from being a Catholic and naturally worshiping and/or following Christ, I actually wanted to care about the Man. All these years in school, etc., I wanted to get a better and better understanding of this period of life for Him, just as I yearn to understand more and more about the Holocaust. This film so beautifully illustrates that period. I was not merely being a good Catholic by going to see the movie and liking it, I was a man whose had some problems of his own and I was watching the suffering of a Man I cared about. The movie didn't have to be about Jesus Christ, it could've been about Martin Luther King, John F. Kennedy, or anyone. The fact remains this is an historical figure who faced great turbulence in his life and at the end I walked out of the theater wanting to hug Christ. There were moments wherein I was bracing myself, thinking, ""yes, I think he's going to get let off here - there's a loophole - I think he's going to walk..."" Even though I know the story well, I just couldn't help myself. It was wishful thinking because that man on the screen was a friend of mine and I was really hoping things could turn around for Him.Film? Movie? Nah. Human Experience? Definitely.",The Passion of the Christ

THe Romans were known through History as being the most cruelest of people, and it was the High priests that had Jesus Condemmned.

If you want a good Lenten meditation on how much Jesus loves you, I'd suggest looking no further the ""Passion of the Christ"". Seeing it only once is not enough. The first time I saw it I actually didn't like it. I got too caught up in the graphic violence and special effects. I kept thinking (during the movie) that no one could survive this kind of treatment and survive especially as they portrayed the scourging. I thought it was way overkill and overly sensationalist. But after the movie, a friend pointed out that these scourger's were professionals, that they knew how to whip multiple times without killing. About a week later, I went again but with the mind set of paying attention to the overall message, not the actual scenes. I enjoyed it so much more. A few weeks later I saw it a third time but didn't enjoy it as much since I started getting ""numb"" to the violence and paid more attention to the special effects again.

And visually, the directors and actors made the scenes so real that you were an actual observer standing on the set.The only part that I felt was not what I expected was that of Mary, Jesus' mother. I think the actress, although she did a good job, did not show the true ""motherly"" love that I was expecting.

As far as historical accuracy goes, it is a very well-researched portrayal(although with minor errors)of these events. Those who believe this movie is anti-Semitic are missing the point. Both the Romans and Jews(as well as Jesus himself)share the blame.Theologically speaking, every person does.Some may not like Catholic concepts and traditions being intermingled with the story, but these do not take away the meaning.If you're looking for a realistic portrayal of Jesus' Passion, you will not be disappointed.

To me it was for the most part just a movie about a guy getting the crap kicked out of him. The only significant part that I recall was when one of the criminals being crucified next to him said that the criminals deserve this, and Jesus does not, and then Jesus says that the criminal will go to heaven with him.

I give tons of credit to Mel Gibson for his courage to direct such a powerful movie. The reason why it was not nominated for any Oscars is because they were against Mel for finding a independent film company to make the movie. You can take all this years movie nominations and they could not hold a candle to 'The Passion Of The Christ'.

Countless people, millions of them have been brutal murdered and tortured for standing up for what they believe in or fighting for a better world. Yet we focus on the life of one man and make 2 hour snuff films about him in the name of God. Today, everyday people are dying horrible deaths at the hands of tyrants and fanatics. How many genocide's have there been, how many innocent children, men and women have been struck down, starved, gassed, poisoned, victims of rape and tossed into mass graves? What their deaths don't count for anything? Jesus gets all the credit? If Jesus was alive today America would have him locked up and tortured at Guantanamo Bay or send SEAL Team 6 after him, after all he was a radical thinker with strong beliefs from the Middle East isn't that what we do with them, imprison them, torture them an humiliate them in an effort to break them? Yes Jesus died a horrible death (if the story is correct) but as I said many other innocent people have as well if not under worse and more painful circumstances. Mel Gibson is an Anti-Semitic lunatic with an alcohol problem and a twisted mind and a bloated ego. Should it really take someone like that to provide you with a profound religious experience to you? I could go on and on but my point is not to offend anyone I am open to your beliefs and opinions so you should be open to mine.

The only way that I was able to stay put and sit through this overstuffed sausage of cinematic dimensions, was to keep making myself believe that I was watching a horror/slasher flick. Mel Gibbs force feeds us a diet of blood and gore and expects the audience NOT to gag. I watched this with a friend on a borrowed DVD and we both reacted similarly to it. I assume the theatrical experience must have been somewhat different, but this film was way too lauded by the religious crazies for me to sit in a room-full of them in a theater. Besides the blood and gore, I found the visuals to be somewhat satisfying and the sound was good and loud. The premise of the movie I won't bother to repeat because I think it has been re-hashed quite a few times on this site, and I think most people know how it ends anyway. I didn't feel any passion while watching any of this...only some mild repulsion and a vague feeling of ennui. I cannot believe that anyone would get teary eyed watching this thing...but then again some people have the most maudlin of tastes.

The violence is very dramatic and gruesome, but very much needed to express the horrors that Jesus suffered. Although, to be quite honest, the brutality that Jesus suffered was more than likely far worse. You have to understand that these people that gave him up to be tortured and crucified hated him because they honestly thought he was being blasphemous. (Which was considered one of the worst crimes during that time.) They did not believe that he was the Son of God, therefore needed to be punished without regard to humanity. But the movie portrays it incredible well, and it moved me to tears. This movie, for those who believe, well make the Crucifixion that more meaningful and powerful. It will make you love God and Jesus more than ever. It will make you have compassion for Jesus. This man, the Son of God, knew what was going to happen, but he still pressed on with his journey. He willingly suffered unspeakable torture and was nailed to a wooded cross and hung there until he died to save us from our sins.

My friend calls this movie The Jesus Chainsaw Masacre. And rightly so. I must say though, if you watch this movie for spiritual enlightenment, that's kinda sick. Seriously. It's like masturbating to Faces Of Death. Which I've done, but felt empty inside afterwards. Then I did it again. But I digress.

The portrayal of Jesus' suffering- how badly he was mocked, beaten, whipped, and bloodied before being nailed to the cross, is very poignantly captured.

The film is filled with gore, violence and very difficult-to-watch scenes. The crucifixion and flogging scenes are extremely painful, to the extent that it may make you flinch. In my opinion, this is exactly what needed to be shown in the film industry. This movie isn't made to preach Christianity, nor is it for a secular crowd. This movie is for those who already know the story, but perhaps would like to see, rather than read, what Christ went through in his final hours. Some claim it is anti-semitic. If Schindler's List isn't anti-Catholic, then this isn't anti-semitic. Nonetheless, the acting is perfect, the historical accuracy is terrific, the directing is well done & the Aramaic and Latin touches are beautiful. I loved this movie and it brought me to tears.

Any parent who would let their under 18 child see this film should be charged with abuse.The few attempts to show anything other than the violence are fragmented and confusing. - Did I miss the memo that assumes you need to read the bible immediately before watching this film or have it committed to memory?

The only parts that I found that wasn't up to Mel Gibson standards was the earthquake scene which I think ruined the whole by which the film was made. The scene looked like it came from a early 1960's film such as the Clash of The Titans or Jason and the Argonauts. The only last scene in the film which was a guard stabbing Jesus in the stomach was also badly made. The reason for this is because he sort of cracked like a marble statue.The torture scenes were that hardest to watch and I think you would also agree. The scenes in which is whipped non-stop until a guard comes in to tell them to stop. They were made to the best standard that the film could of been done. The actor that played Jesus was hurt himself during the production process. The injuries that he got were a 14cm cut down his arm while the torture scene was shot. He also got stuck by lighting whilst under a umbrella during the production. He caught the flu and starched his head while the crown of thorns were on when he falls over, whilst carrying the cross. He also got terrible blisters over his wear were they had to put make-up on him, which took 10 HOURS! a day.The makeup was done by the same bloke that did the Mrs Doubtfire film.Overall, this is the goriest film that I have seen and when his getting whipped with metal shards over the back and front, there was a little tear in my eye.

You are waiting for a movie that tells you something new about Christ, something new about humanity and christianity and you get this piece of sadistic images, maybe It works with the American public, always so thirsty of blood and torture, but it doesn't work with the rest of the world were people are no so interested in seeing how a man is beaten and beaten hundred times, just unjustified violence, it's no wonder that in the USA millions of people went to see this movie already at the opening day, well, millions of religious puritans payed just to see their hero to die again for their sins, all the American sinners are now clean again, they can continue being as hypocrites as before and continue their war politics around the most poor countries on the world. And maybe the film doesn't portrait at all the life or the last hours of Jesus, but it is an excellent portrait of what is it about the American ""anti-culture"". In the movie the Romans are portrait just like ancients U.S marines, imperialist soldiers well uniformed and very hard guys, very well trained troops, some parts of the movie it's just as watching another stupid Vietnam war where the soldiers don't speak English or Vietnamise, but Latin and Aramean. Jesus the poor guy is our little hero but for the Americans the Romans are even cooler because they were just doing their job, and they are not so bad after all, the fault it was of the Jews, they were the guilty ones, not the good Pilatus man, he was just doing his best.That's the only idea of this very simple minded film, the Jews are the murders, the Romans were a strong empire (like America), and Jesus was just there in the cross to see all this people torture him.

It is one thing to read in the Bible how he was tortured and made to carry his own cross, but a completely different experience to visually see the pain he endured.To those who this this film was too violent: had it been sugar-coated for our eyes we would not have truly understood how much Jesus loves us and what he went through to save us. Everyday the media inundates us with explosions, shootings, pornography, etc.  This was not violence for violence sake as so many ""blow-em-up, shoot-em-up"" films are these days.  We need to see just what Jesus went though to truly understand His love for us.I left the theater with a renewed sense of passion for the Lord.

The visual's okay, but can't be that impressive, especially if you're used with anime. The background music made me wish there would be some 'added for dramatic purpose' battle scene. I won't complain about characterisation or dialogues, because that's pretty much what was in the Bible. But nothing's really special, nothing's really touching. Just close your eyes during the torture and crucifixion scenes. They're not touching, they are horrifying.And I cried when watching Spirited Away or Amelie. NOT FOR 'THE PASSION'. Yes, Jesus suffered badly, but so are thousand of torture victims throughout the history. So don't say 'our suffering is nothing to Our Lord's'. Many people suffer 'in the name of Our Lord' by torturers who work 'in the name of Our Lord'.The best thing in this movie is...Monica Bellucci. Haven't appreciated her as much before.

The graphical violence is so pure and subtleless - and very well done - that is almost impossible the hardest soul not to feel the pressure of the images. That pressure is needed, not with the intention to convert anyone, but at least to review the concepts of humanity. Again: humanity, not spirituality.
This is another intriguing topic: Jesus seen as a man, not exactly as a mystical figure. He suffers as a human being, the spectator could feel on himself the pain.Not only the graphical violence is used as source, the moral violence fills the movie, like preconception, power abuse, intolerance... And they are not easy to swallow as well.By the way, ""Passion of the Christ"" is not easy to swallow, but is very important to be tasted.",The Passion of the Christ
1192,Kev_Berg,"Very Good, but a little flawed",10,22 March 2004,"Mel Gibson more or less hits a bullseye with ""The Passion of The Christ"". That there are some flaws is perhaps inevitable.First the pluses. The acting, especially from Jim Caviezel as Jesus and Maia Morgenstern as Jesus's Mother Mary, is heartbreakingly good. Caleb Deschanel's Caravaggio-esque cinematography is spectacular. Editor John Wright does a brilliant job with the editing, an example of which is his juxtaposition of the crucifixion with the Last Supper. And John Debney's music adds to the emotion generated by the actors. Overall, its great to have the full brunt of Hollywood's prowess directed at the story of Christ. I had gotten used to either movie of the week fare like ""The Gospel of John"" or dated Hollywood films such as ""King of Kings"".The weakest part of this movie is Benedict Fitzgerald and Mel Gibson's screenplay. On the one hand it is a brilliant structural idea to focus on the last twelve hours of Christ, filling in the details of his ministry threw flashbacks. However, not enough detail is conveyed in these flashbacks. People not familiar with the Bible will likely be quite lost. It would be similar to going to see ""The Two Towers"" without first reading ""The Lord of the Rings"" or seeing ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Also, the motivation of key characters such as Judas is not provided.While Mel Gibson's directing is overall excellent, he lingers to much on the details of the scourging and crucifixion, losing much of the effect by desensitizing his audience. And he adds some rather cheesy scenes, such as Satan's rather comical ""death"".Despite these flaws, the movie is overall a great experience. Charges of antisemitism prove to be groundless. As in the Bible, the Jewish authority react as they would to any other blasphemer, and they look downright holy compared to the sadistic Romans. The movie stays remarkably true to the Gospels. The adaption is of similar quality as ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies are to the book. Greatly recommended.",The Passion of the Christ
1193,tneagle,Awesome!,10,2 September 2004,"This was an awesome movie. I believe every adult and teen should see this movie. It shows the price Jesus paid for our salvation, the forgiveness of sin, and our healing. Check Acts 2:38, John 3;16 and Isaiah 53. I was so impacted by this movie. My wife and I were just soberly and deeply affected after viewing this movie. It promotes an internal evaluation of your relationship with Christ. After the movie, most people were either crying or speechless. I know my wife and I said very few words on our way home. I believe God inspired Mel Gibson to make this movie to show His love for humankind in this endtime. The movie was an epic that every person should have in their libraries. Go buy this movie and God bless.",The Passion of the Christ
1194,RnR,Sickest and steamiest pile of rubbish ever made,1,16 November 2004,"First, kudos to Jim Caviezel. His acting was top notch. I would also give high praise to the makeup and special effects wizards. Their efforts could not be beat. However, the rest of this movie is a complete and utter waste of film.If the movie is an accurate depiction of Biblical accounts of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, then the Bible is a fanciful work of fictional horror. There is no way that anyone would live through the beatings depicted in this film, much less have enough strength afterward to carry a wooden cross as far as one inch. If the beating scenes depicted were exaggerated for artistic reasons, then all I can say is that Mel Gibson is one sick and twisted individual and needs to be locked away for a very long time. A lobotomy might be in order.I think I will be praying for all of the ""Christians"" who think this is a great film. Methinks some of you need to take a hard and fast look at your morals. This is truly one disgusting horror film.",The Passion of the Christ
1195,bslade,"Seemingly accurate, but actually insidiously anti-semitic (and gorey)",1,14 March 2004,"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of Christ"" follows the style of Mel Gibson's other movies with an obsessive fascination on the themes of sadism and suicide. But I sort of expected endless, closeup, graphic gore (and I wasn't let down).  I was surprised at how insidiously anti-semitic the movie was.The reason I use the word ""insidiously"" is because the movie has the feel of being painstakingly accurate.  The costuming, the use of aramaic and latin, and the filming in what appears to be the original locations, all makes it feel as if great pains were taken to get every detail right.But in the film, Ponchus Pilot is portrayed as an even-handed contemplative Roman ruler.   In real life, I understand, he was reprimanded by Rome for crucifying too many people.   He had to have been pretty bad to get reprimanded by Rome.At the same time, the Jewish priests are portrayed as bloodthirsty rabble rousers who rally the crowd to kill Jesus as if they were drunk on a Saturday night.So somebody who doesn't know what's going on sees this seemingly historically accurate movie portraying the Roman leader as thoughtful and regretful leader who is forced by the bloodthirsty Jews to kill Jesus.I'm surprised there's not more outrage voiced about this film.Aside from the endless graphic gore and anti-semitism, the movie didn't really work at a dramatic level.   I didn't feel any context for why everything was going on.   There was no dramatic plot line to keep my interest, etc.   That's too bad, it could've been a fascinating movie. Go see ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" instead.  It's a more insightful film.",The Passion of the Christ
1196,mxking-2,"Most powerful, meaningful movie I have ever seen.",10,4 February 2004,"This movie absolutely blew me away.  It was more than a movie; it was an experience.  When it was over I quietly got up from my seat, walked to my car and drove home.  I couldn't speak to anyone, I turned the radio off in my car.  I just went home and went to bed.  I was rendered speechless. The visions of what I saw have not left me since then.  That is a good thing because it is a constant reminder of the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for me.  There was absolutely no anti-semitism shown in this film.  It failthfully sticks to the Gospel and the message to me was that we are ALL responsible for His death.  But we are ALL blessed by his resurrection. Praise God!!!  SEE THIS MOVIE AS SOON AND AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN.  THEN BUY IT WHEN IT COMES TO VIDEO.",The Passion of the Christ
1197,TomPayne,More than the death of a Son... The love of a Mother and Father,10,22 March 2004,"This film was much, much better than I expected.  And much more inspiring than I had hoped.I had read dozens of reviews previously from others and almost decided not to see the movie.  After talking to a good friend of mine, I decided to attend a showing with our Catholic parish.  How thankful I am that I went.Indeed it is graphic.  Though, I must say, less so than I was expecting - after hearing all the hype from the media.  But what happened to this man, Jesus, was brutal and this film justly depicts that brutality.  It is, however, portrayed in a way that is ""watchable"".  Know that the violence is inflicted on him, but embrace it and look through it and beyond it.  There is much more to Gibson's ""Passion"".What touched me the most in the film - and quite unexpectedly - was the portrayed parental love.  The extreme love shown of Mary to her son was absolutely incredible.  My wife and I - new parents of 16 months - cried in each other's arms.  Seeing Mary love her son so much, made me love my wife more and my daughter more.  Truly I am touched by her example.There is also a single ""heavenly"" tear shed after the crucifixion from a loving father.  Perfect.If you're not sure about going to see this film, GO SEE IT!  You can look away or close your eyes during a few of the ""difficult"" scenes, but don't miss the opportunity to see this incredible, awe-inspiring, faith-filled account of Jesus' gift of life.",The Passion of the Christ
1198,ylo_rlr,Believable,10,25 February 2004,"The Passion of Christ is no more violent and no less accurate than The Gladiator.  More accurate when I hear Latin (eventhough sounding a little too Italian) and Aramaic coming from the actors.  Anti-Jewish? Not possible. Throughout the movie, Jesus forgives everyone.  Tells us to forgive.  The movie shows Pontius Pilate, Caiphus, Jews, Romans, all were responsible for killing Christ.  But Christ, and at the least, true Christians, forgive. So regardless that Man was responsible, if he asks for His forgiveness, he is absolved.I've read other comments complaining about Jim Caviezel not being ""Middle Eastern"" and of being Caucasian.  ""Middle Eastern"" people are Caucasian, as are Asian Indians of all color, who cares, we're all human.As for the Rating and violence.  This was real, this IS important.  For those that say it was gratuitous and that it doesn't show the ""true"" Christian values of hope and love: It shows, forgiveness through extreme hardship, it shows the love of His Mother, it shows the many people, Jews and Romans, directly touched by the love of Jesus, it shows hope with His resurrection.Not a dry eye in the theatre.

For people that must visualize something to believe it; this does the job.  I have been a Christian for years and this movie struck a cord with me that I have not felt for years.The argument that this movie places blame on the Jews is irrelevant.  What happened was God's plan.  Easily the best quality movie ever made.  The acting was unmatched and the special effects were do good that you felt that you were actually there.  Best sound in any movie.  Bravo to Mel Gibson for having the courage to make this wonderful movie. I hope that this movie convinces Hollywood that Christians will pay to see a decent movie.

It is a phenomenal portrayal of Christ's sacrifice for us on the cross, and I applaud Mel Gibson for championing the cause of this film.Although I didn't feel the movie lived up to my image of what it would be like (with all of the media hype), it was indeed a gruesomely accurate depiction of the last hours of Jesus' life before the crucifixion. I wouldn't bring children to see it; indeed there were MANY adults sobbing throughout the theater because of the intense violence.Many folks I talked to felt the movie was so graphic that it numbed us to the point of LESS emotion - we simply cannot comprehend what Christ did on our behalf, even after seeing this film. I left not with a sense of disgust, but of gratitude for my salvation. The fact that He endured the hardships He did to settle my eternal debt is mind boggling.Oh yeah, the movie also has great acting, directing, editing, music, effects, cinematograhphy, and everything else.

1201,icgaby,Bloody movie,1,31 March 2004,"I was very dissapointed after i saw this movie. It focuses only on brutal part of Christ punishment only to attract viewers. It's far from message of Christ, and i think is overexagerated. I think anybody in this world would die after first beating in the movie. I don't say that Christ's punishment was easy or not shocking. But this movie focuses exclusively on that. It tries to shock the viewer by visual images (something not unusual in a Mel Gibson's film).Not an intelligent, spiritual, thoughtful movie, but a brutal shocking one. It feeds contemporan huger for heroes and for blood. Jesus is not the simple man from Bible, but in this movie is a sort of Superman who resists to all those beatings nobody would do in the real life. What a big difference from Zeffirelli's movie wich is not by far so popular and admired.",The Passion of the Christ

In fact, the last such movie was 'Remember The Titans' and it pails in comparison to 'The Passion Of The Christ'.For a long time now many people have been content with the fact that Hollywood was only capable of creating badly scripted movies ladened with 'how dumb do they think we are' special effects, acted out by people incapable of getting a real job and using acting as a last resort.

1203,ozzie6767,A completely original approach to narrative,10,25 February 2004,"Just a few thoughts:Gibson's film is a true original, and that can be seen in the wildly divergent points of view from major critics nationwide.  The way it approaches narrative is to focus on one event until it plays out, with each character merely filling in the story.  I do not use merely to belittle the acting, which is excellent.  I just mean that the actors are only required to show the action and reaction surrounding Christ's death.  There has not been a narrative that I can remember that drives a film such as this one does.  Together with being brilliantly-made, this film may truly be a landmark one.Peace, Oz",The Passion of the Christ
1204,axl-15,awful,1,23 February 2005,"Dredging up old passion plays does nothing more than stoke anti-Semitic sentiments all over again. Add to that the fact that Gibson and his father are the leaders of a tiny Christian cult so far to the right that they make Limbaugh look liberal, and we have one of the sorriest moves in recent memory. Both men have made disparaging comments about Jewish pople in the past, and there is little doubt at all that that was the motivation for this film.There's also the movie itself here, an hours-long orgy of endless blood and gore. Good Christians should be ashamed of such filth and denounce this monstrosity at every opportunity.",The Passion of the Christ
1205,moonshot71,Amazing Film!,9,8 May 2004,"The Passion of the Christ deals with one of history's most defining moments, the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth.  This single event caused fundamental split in the Jewish faith and gave birth to the Christian religion.  This adaptation of the gospels brings new life to the nearly 2000-year-old story, with the use of lighting, sound, cinematography, and a wonderfully told story. The film begins before dawn in the moon-lit garden of Gethsemane.  Jesus is praying so hard he shakes as he contemplates the task before him -dying a terrible, shameful death for the sake of man kind.  This is where the tone of this somber film is set through the use of lighting and sound. Director Mel Gibson has chosen to follow a new trend in filmmaking by using as much natural lighting as possible.  This makes for darker night scenes, but more natural colors and shadows.  Studio lighting can washout the natural shadows found in the world.  But natural, or available lighting, captures realism. Throughout the film, whether the setting is a garden, or a temple, city street, it feels real and alive.  This is in part due to the detailed set and costume design, but also to the lighting, which was often provided only by a torch, or the moon, or an oil lamp. Tone is also established by the use of sound.  The movie presented in Aramaic and Latin, with English subtitles at the bottom.  But the audience does not have to do much reading since there is not a lot of dialog.  Most of the story is told through body language and facial expressions, which are all enhanced by the use of a carefully crafted soundtrack.  Orchestrated music and chanting vocals carry the film through some of the most dramatic scenes.  During Jesus' torture, Mary does not say anything, but the haunting moans of a female vocalist express her internal anguish.  But there are also times when the music stops leaving only poignant, thought-provoking silence. At the moment that Jesus' cross is raised above the crowed all the noise (the crowd, hammers; the music) stops and the audience only hears a cold silence. The sounds of this film are much like the colors.  Dull, somber blues and grays with spots of contrastingly loud reds.  The interest of the audience is maintained by the soundtrack, which builds and releases the tension of the film in waves.  The drama is built up to a breaking point, and then it is relaxed to give the audience time to recuperate and reflect, and then it repeats the cycle.  This allows the story line to be powerful without being totally overwhelming or draining.  As the unique use of lighting and sound shows us, this is a film that attempts to take a story that almost all of us know and look at it in a new light. Although this is a story that has been told countless times, this version finds a way to approach it in a way that has sparked new interest.  It has done so by being as realistic as possible.  Jesus died a long and painful death and this film not only portrays that violence with startling realism, by it portrays the motivations for that violence with focused realism.  In the Bible, it is said that Jesus was beaten so badly that he ribs were exposed.  This sounds traumatic on the page, but you really don't grasp the severity of that statement until you see it with your own eyes.  Many people have been shocked by the graphic nature of this film and this is probably because they never realized how terrible this act of violence was. This film often brings new prospective by placing the viewer in Jesus' position.  By use of choice camera angles, the audience can see Jesus' point of view while he is being beaten, while he carries his cross through the streets, when he falls to the ground, and when he is on the cross.  There was no need for a voice over of internal dialog to tell the viewer what Jesus was thinking.  The emotion was placed on the screen. But this is not simply an exploitation of violence.  The violence in this movie is set within a clear context.  This film makes it clear why Jesus was so hated by the chief priests, why Judas and Peter betrayed him, why Pilate condemned him to death, and most importantly, why Jesus went along peacefully.  The plot pulls all of these complicated factors together where they can be seen clearly.  There are conflicts and character dynamics in this movie that rival even the most twisted murder mystery or detective novel, and this film pulls all the elements together in a well formulated, thorough, and convincing manner.  The over-all message: Jesus was betrayed by his own people and yet was willing suffered and died to save them.  No other film has made this message so clear.  No other film has expressed how hard it has for all the characters involved to make the decisions they did. It is clear that the chief priests found Jesus to be a blasphemist threat to their power.  It is clear that Judas sold his best friend out and regretted it so much he had to kill himself.  It is clear that everyone's faith was challenged.  Even Jesus was pressured, by the devil himself, not to go through with what he knew he needed to do.  But when the time comes, he allows himself to be arrested, without struggle.  He does not save himself by denying the charges against him.  He does not curse his attackers.  And when it is time for him to be put to death he warmly embraces his cross and carries it through the streets.  There is a clear moral message that rewards those who faithfully do what is right, despite all the forces that say otherwise. This is a masterpiece in modern storytelling.  Not only are all the events of the crucifixion examined and explained, but the film also flashes back to key events in Jesus' life that help tie it all together.  The washing of Pilate's hands is paralleled with the washing of the disciples' feet. Jesus' torture is paralleled with the persecution that his followers will suffer in the years to come.  The crucifixion is paralleled with the last supper, when Jesus offered his body as a new covenant.  Jesus' Sermon on the Mount is paralleled when his is cross placed high atop a hill. This film will speak to almost everyone who sees it, but those who have a substantial knowledge of the bible will be enthralled with all of the minute details that have been included: There are many allusions to Old Testament passages.  For example, in the garden, Jesus crushes a snake under his heal, which is an allusion to Jacob and Joseph. There are also a lot of `knowing glances' from one character to another. But the most powerful use of eyes is when Mary stares long and hard at the audience at the end of the film, to show that Jesus' painful death is everyone's fault. There are also more obscure metaphors.  For example, when Jesus is stabbed by a soldier and the blood that flows out of his side becomes water that washes over the soldier, like a baptism. Or the dove that flies above Jesus' trial, which symbolized the Holy Spirit.  This is one of those movies that can be watched repeatedly and each time it will reveal more meaning. The Passion of the Christ is directed by Mel Gibson, the star of such block busters as the epic Brave Heart and the spiritually enlighten supernatural thriller Signs.  It is clear that he started this project, which he funded, with a clear vision and a will to follow that vision to completion. This movie is fully engaging from beginning to end.  And as the title alludes, it is very very passionate.  Surely, this is will be remembered as one of the most powerful and captivating films of all time. Due to the graphic nature this film is rate R and is only recommended for adults.  Because of a great story line that is pulled together by the use of effect lighting and sound, this film receives five out of five stars.",The Passion of the Christ
1206,mbaker280,"A well made, bloody film",8,6 March 2004,"Having just recently viewed Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", I felt the need to comment. Let me first say that it is an extremely well made film by a very competent filmmaker, with an excellent cast and apparently an excellent crew, judging by the film produced by them.The film begins at Jesus's self-exploration at Gethsemane and storms ahead from there, growing continually more violent, and graphically so, until the inescapable conclusion. The actor playing Jesus does an excellent job in all of his scenes, with a wide emotional range from happy to deeply sad to beaten down to confident. The added realism of Aramaic as the spoken language throughout most of the film lends a certain credibility to all of the events portrayed, as well as the excellently blended special effects, few though they may be.However, in spite of it being so well made and so apparently accurate to the history from which it has sprung, I have to question some of the choices Gibson made throughout the film, particular in the level of graphic violence portrayed. I found the film to be very good, however, I couldn't necessarily say that I enjoyed watching it. The film makes the viewer uncomfortable almost to the point where it is unbearable, until at last the roller coaster ride is over. I completely understand why Gibson should have chosen this route, particularly consider his past works like Braveheart, and the fact that very few movies have explored that particular aspect of Jesus's last days in that level of detail. However, it could perhaps have been something better left unexplored.As it stands, I would not watch the film again, but I am glad that I've seen it, if only to satisfy my curiosity.Viewers with weak hearts or weak stomachs, this film is probably one to pass by.",The Passion of the Christ
1207,david.etchells,Speechless (almost),10,30 March 2004,"A brutal but captivating retelling of a ""story"" that has been told every which way.Mel Gibson has to be applauded for not flinching from showing what others have shied away from. I never viewed the film as entertainment in the normal sense and it was curiosity that attracted me to see the film as much as anything else. I was simply stunned by the end and it was a while before either my wife or myself moved from our seats, it somehow felt disrespectful. The scenes of punishment and the crucifixion were brutal and did make for uncomfortable viewing but credit to Gibson for being brave enough to show them instead of the usual cut away. What drove him to depict such graphic scenes only he can answer that.

1208,srhillman,The Maker of This Movie Hates Jews,1,4 June 2006,"Before seeing The Passion Of the Christ I felt that all the hoopla surrounding it was justified in that if one person came out of it with anti-semitic feelings then it was an unnecessary and irresponsible film. I didn't need to see it to come to this conclusion. There is more than enough hatred of Jews in this world, that a popular moviemaker like Mel Gibson didn't need to share his warped vision of this particular fairy tale. Gibson took a story that has many interpretations and put his own violent, hate-filled touch on what should be an inspiring story. As someone who knows nothing about the story of Jesus Christ, I was hoping this movie would shed some light on the subject, but it didn't at all. I know nothing about Jesus that I didn't already know, except that the Jews made sure he was put to a horrible, torturous death. I will never see another Mel Gibson flick. He really should be ashamed of himself. What a joke!",The Passion of the Christ
1209,vanhail,Good job Gibson,9,1 May 2006,"When I saw the Passion playing on showtime a week back, I thought, might as well go laugh at how badly Mel screwed up by making a movie about the savior of the Christian faith, but I was impressed to say the least. It retained Mel's classic love for bloodshed and honor, with a hint of arrogance in Jesus's words. As far as the story itself goes (I'm not Christian of Jewish, so I didn't lean one way or the other towards the hundreds of suggestive points in the movie) I was both impressed and disgusted. Impressed, in the sense that the countless little things in the movie really made it sparkle. Cassius is the name of the soldier who stabbed Jesus in the movie, same as the Cassius who brought down the Roman emperor Caesar, same as the tortured soul in Dante's Inferno, being gnawed on by Satan. Another nice connection in the movie was the constant flashback sequences, I thought they really livened up the movie, giving it's audience a break from Christ's torture and reminding it's Christian audience that his death was a righteous one, and should be rejoiced upon. I was simply disgusted by how many people betrayed Jesus, when they had so many opportune moments to help him. Even the provincial leader showed Jesus compassion, when the Romans are constantly depicted as the ""evil imperialist beings"". Final note, The Passion was a spectacular piece of work, but for all the Christian families that brought their 5 year old children to see it upon release, THEIR CHILDREN YOU IDIOTS!

1210,danrexx,Great and unforgettable!,10,1 March 2004,"I never wrote a comment on a movie here but after watching this I feel compelled to write down all my raised feelings: I was very curious about this movie and also very afraid to watch it due to the crude contents many reviewers spoke about. Actually I watch gore movies without problems (as this movie was compared to them) because I know it is only fiction, but this one was a bit tricky for me because of its allegedly truthfulness. Well after watching it I say that it is Just Great! There's absolutely not all the carnage I heard about, the camera stays on the spot only the time needed and doesn't exceed it. Perhaps many reviewers got used with the usual Jesus movies were you see smiling actors and where big stars shine overall. But this is a movie about the suffering Jesus had to pass and Mel Gibson did a great job that had to be absolutely done to explain what that suffering real was. People at those time were NOT aware of the Human Rights and killing and torturing another person was their daily piece of cake (think about the""normality"" of the crucifixion practice itself) They were barbarian times were people were tortured and killed mindlessly, somebody could easily raise hate and crowd against the target of the moment (see Magdalene avoided stoning). The real shock of this movie is when you think that this perhaps happened for real and Jesus himself probably went inside this ordeal....to save all the people that were condemning him! I'm not religious but this movie has to be seen to understand the real meaning behind the Cross/Jesus symbol without easily discarding it as religion prop. Also it is a great piece of direction with flashbacks that include previous life and growing of Christ to the genius of making water drop fall down, after crucifixion, from the point of view of God himself! A creation in the whole that achieves poetry! All actors are perfect in their role and James Caviezel deserves at least an Oscar Nomination. I wept during the showing not only because of Jesus, but because of the Man and for what ignorant and arrogant people can carelessly do to other persons; it is like living the torture practiced on men during humankind history! I don't know if everything went exactly as depicted in the movie but for sure being crucified for Jesus was surely not a walk in the park and this film portrays as it probably went, being a God overall but being a flesh and bone Man when on Earth, afraid at the beginning of the movie of what will come for him. It is a dirty movie that will put you near Jesus and his suffering , that will wrench your gut and will stay for you even after.

1213,simmsj-1,Pulp Crucifixion...,3,21 June 2006,"A summary of this movie: A man is condemned to death. You watch him die for the next two hours. Once I had made it through the beatings by the priests and the whippings, the fleeting thought went through my head that anyone who gave this a 10 should have given the same rating to Hostel, or any of the other recent horror-gorefests.Although not a practicing Christian, I was raised Catholic, and I came into this movie with an open mind. I am interested in mythology, including Christian. This movie contained little of the interesting symbology that is the Christian mystique. There was no dialogue of any substance, and no character development whatsoever. If I didn't know the story of the Bible, I would have been utterly lost, and though it seems universally assumed that everyone knows the Bible, I don't think it's good movie-making to base any script on an assumption as big as that.The music was horribly cliché, very over-dramatic, and obviously a poor attempt at making the audience feel something from this film.I will say that I appreciate the efforts to make this movie accurate to the story, by using authentic languages in the dialogue of the film and very non-Hollywood actors. Mary was the only character in the film who was able to elicit any emotion out of me, and I applaud Maia for that.Aside from that, I found very little that was redeeming about this film. I feel that people only rate it as highly as they do because it is the story of Christ. If this were any other book-to-movie adaptation and it had been done this poorly, no one would be praising Mel Gibson as a great director, nor claiming the film as a masterpiece.",The Passion of the Christ
1214,drcbrcicb,The most visceral Christian experience,9,14 April 2020,"I am not certain I have ever felt as emotionally (even physically) drained as I did at the end of this movie. The gut-wrenching depiction of Christ's torture at the hands of the Roman soldiers was almost too much. It was even more painful to watch than the actual crucifixion. Jim Caviezel delivers a subtle portrayal of Jesus. You truly feel his full humanity with an undercurrent of Jesus' divinity always there. The most heart-wrenching performance, however, was that of Maia Morgenstern as Mary. Even from a male perspective, her poignant channeling of the depths of every Mother's love brought tears. As a Christian, I was brought to a much more complete understanding of the sacrifice and true love Jesus has for his children. I thank Mel Gibson for his willingness to sink his life and talents into this project.",The Passion of the Christ
1215,kbncyk,Hollywood's bigotry & The Passion,10,4 June 2006,"This was an AMAZING, artistic masterpiece. Absolutely stunning.So why the total and complete lack of respect from Hollywood, i.e., no Oscar nominations for Mel Gibson as director or James Caviezel as actor?In comparison to some of the other films that are nominated and win, the Passion is head and shoulders above them all. For instance, I can't remember a nominated actor speaking all the lines of the film in another language, much less something as difficult as Latin, and be believable, like James Caviezel. So why the lack of recognition from the Hollywood award community? It'll be interesting to count all the nominiations ""The DaVinci Code"" gets next year from the Oscars and other major awards. I predict here and now that Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, and others tied to that film will get nominated in all the major categories, and will take home many awards. That will definitely drive home a fact that has been crystal-clear to me since The Passion was snubbed in all the major award categories - that prejudice against Christians, Catholics in particular, is alive and well in 21st century Hollywood.",The Passion of the Christ
1216,gizmo_griffin,"Incredible, and scary",7,20 July 2006,"When I first went to see the film in theaters, I was a little apprehensive about it because I new that it would be very graphic. I was also excited about it because it was the first Christian film that had come out in theaters in years that I wanted to see. Being a Christian, I was a little surprised at the fact that, spiritually, it did nothing for me. Sure I cried a little when he was being beaten, but not much. I thought that the film served as a good reminder of what Christ did for us, but thats about it. I think that Mel Gibson went a little overboard with the gore, and that that was a distraction from the overall beauty of the film. One of the things that touched me the most in the film was Mary's relationship with her son, Jesus. It reminds you that Jesus wasn't just a healer and preacher or the messiah for the Christians, he was a man. He had feelings and emotions just like you or me. For that, I thank Gibson. The film was one that was great the first time around, maybe even the second or third, but it isn't one that you would choose to watch on whim.",The Passion of the Christ

I knew that when it was over, I would feel much better, but I knew that the process might cause pain and uneasiness.  As much as I thought I would be right, I think that it might have even been a bit of an understatement.During the movie, I felt so many emotions... excitement, fear, fright, shock, compassion, empathy, deep sorrow, and a brief moment of joy.  At the conclusion, I found myself clutching my chest with one hand, holding my pounding heart.  My knees were weak, and my legs were numb as a result of the stress that my body had just endured.  I have never experienced such a physical reaction to any other movie.  It was amazing.What a joy to have been able to see this in my lifetime.

We simply watch the son of man being persecuted and horribly tortured for nearly the entire duration of the film. I found it entirely boring and not the least bit insightful. There is some very good acting, but it is not involving in any way since the characters are amazingly one-dimensional.Emotionally draining it is, but only as much as any film would be where the main character is tortured for the bulk of the film with very few lines to speak of. This monotony is broken only by the occasional appearance of a grinning Satan and occasionally some demonic children. In a movie about the last hours of Jesus I had hoped Mel would not resort to clichéd and cartoonish symbols of evil to convey the story.

I remember my feelings during Schindler's List and this was so much more.  Mary, the mother of Jesus, was such a powerful emotional vehicle that I identified more emotionally to her than directly to Jesus.  Mel Gibson's use of flashbacks and black screens was very effective of carrying us into the movie.  While there was a tremendous amount of violence I don't believe it was excessive. There have many more gruesome movies.  What made this one different was that the violence was visited on a single individual.  It was violence on a very personal level.  The movie was one of the most effective ever.I've never been so convicted of my sin before now.  Christ's sacrafice for me has never been so real before this movie.

With all the exposure to Christ's suffering, I cannot say that I fully grasped what HE went through until viewing this film.I've seen criticism that 3/4 of the movie is Christ's suffering, cruelly beaten and belittled. The scourging seems to go on forever, and the brutality and realism of the scenes wee almost more than I could bear. But, who would think that the actual experience was anything less?The carrying of the cross was equally intense as was the crucifixion itself.If you choose to see this movie, be prepared to be shaken to your very soul.

1225,vangelis2006,Movie errors and mistakes,10,19 July 2006,"The movie is excellent and the objective was accomplished well. We have a reference tool to proclaim Jesus message of love and forgiveness. I found some minor errors on the historic facts that need revision or correction on new movie versions of the life of Jesus.1) There is no evidence that the scourging tortures were open to the public assistance. In the movie, we see both Mary observing the torture along with all the people who wanted to be there.2) The prisoners were forced to carry the horizontal wood of the crux over their arms. When the wrists were nailed, the prisoner was risen in the air to the vertical wood, forming the crux and ending with the foot nailing. In this movie we see a complete crux of excessive weight carried by Jesus. According to the Holy Shroud image, Jesus carry the horizontal wood only.3) Nails perforations were on the wrists, not in the palm of the hand. This is also confirmed in the Holy Shroud image.4) Mary Magdalene was a different person than the woman who Jesus save from the stoning due to the sin of adultery. In this movie, Jesus saves Mary Magdalene from stoning, suggesting she was the same adulteress woman of the Godspel.I suppose there is a justification to these changes. In overall, it was a movie to be experienced. For me it was an inspiration to be a better person and assume leadership to transform the world inside me.",The Passion of the Christ

1227,madisonthompson-19907,So glad I saw it,9,28 April 2020,"It's a movie I'd avoided for awhile; hearing about the graphic violence was a turn off for me, as that's something I try to avoid in all films, but being a Christian classic, I had to give it a chance. I'm very glad that I did; it was incredibly moving, an overall positive viewing experience for me. Watching it during Lent was very meditative for me, and helped to illuminate Christ's Passion for me a bit more.I don't lack any criticism. There's a lot going on in The Passion that seems pretty out-there for anyone familiar with the story of Christ. The gospels only tell us so much, and this film only covers a brief period of His ministry (and these accounts taking only minutes to read in each gospel). As such, there is a need to exercise artistic license, and though it's mostly done well here, there are many people and situations that simply feel unreal. The first that I recall is Jesus being shoved off of a bridge with something around His neck. He stops falling feet from the ground, appearing right in front of Judas. This latter part I take no issue with- though not recorded in any of the gospels, it is a reminder that Jesus didn't ""forget about"" Judas after seeing him (presumably for the last time) in the garden of Gethsemane. It's actually a quite and oddly beautiful moment. What gets me, though, is that surviving such a fall is unrealistic. The Son of God is the Son of God, but if being crucified managed to kill Him, then I would imagine that a fall which would break anyone else's neck would also break His. I think this scene could have been executed better, to keep some semblance of realism.Then there's Herod. I heard by word of mouth (never bothered to check myself) that Herod has traditionally been associated with the bizarre, but his appearance (and the actor's portrayal of him) goes beyond bizarre. It was rather immersion breaking, and now, a year after having watched it for the first time, I believe that this scene from The Passion could easily be confused with something out of Alice in Wonderland rather than the gospel event that it is.Though these were pretty major hits, I'm not without further praise. The moments shared with various individuals on His way to Pilate, and then to be crucified, is enough to make up for those shortcomings. Seeing a carpenter at work brings back a memory for Him of making a table for a rich man, and a fond moment He shared with His mother. Then when Jesus sees her during the carrying of the cross, Mary recalls picking Him up as a child after having a fall. He also shares moments with (who is called) Saint Veronica, when she pushes through the crowd to wipe His face (and try to give Him water). Then we get to see the compassion that Simon of Cyrene had for Him after the Roman soldiers beat and mock Him on the way. These moments were all wonderfully done, and did much to add pity, gratitude, and intensify the sorrow the audience already no doubt feels. The Passion sets a high standard for all films to follow. Special effects, a great cast and impressive lines are all worthless if the audience isn't filled with a myriad of emotions which compliment each other nicely. 16 years later, The Passion remains to be the paragon which all Jesus movies should follow.",The Passion of the Christ

I'm sorry if I offend anyone but I'm Jewish and this movie really upset me cause I know the truth I have studied it and so have many others and they can say that the things that we're in that movie didn't really happen.

When the soldiers came and asked for Jesus, He could have decided to say no, FULLY KNOWING WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM, HE STILL SAID, 'I AM HE.' This film speaks for itself. For any doubters out there who say Jesus wasn't who He said He was, just watch Mary. Tell me what mother could stand there and watch her son endure what Jesus did without opening her mouth? Mary did because Mary knew. She knew He was virgin born, and she knew this had to happen.

Jesus Christ died for our sins because he loves us and does not want us to be separated from him for eternity.  However, the thought that I left the film with, and am still really trying to grasp is: Why did Jesus have to die? Or, put another way, Why am I given life at the expense of Christ?  Why does God love me so much that he is willing to sacrifice his own son to ensure that there will be an everlasting love between us?  This doesn't come out in the film at all.

It wasn't too graphic, i mean how do you depict a flaying of an iconic figure gently, without undermining the whole premise of the subject matter?And it wasn't, i feel, anti-semetic, rather that a small number of human men wanted at that time in history, to hold on to their little piece of status, which is as it has been before and since.If the jewish priests depicted in the film were guilty of anything, it was being human, and therefore flawed as we all are, to start pointing fingers at each other two thousand years after the fact is rather missing the point of the film, which in fact was to love each other and respect differing points of view.In fact, the sermon on the mount flashback made me think of buddhism, which considering that i am totally uninterested in any form of religion is interesting in itself, as i still found the subject matter compelling.Finally, is this a good or a bad film, i think all art in all forms is subjective in it's interpretation, and so, personally i liked it, it was impressive in it's lack of dialogue, and visual accomplishment, and yes i will see it again, to see it without concentrating on the subtitles.I suggest that anyone who wants to know what all the fuss is about should go see for themselves!

1246,ghostyoshark,Rocky for Christians,1,6 May 2004,"Very poor.Man gets brutally beaten for a couple of hours. Thin plot in between to stir up an audience.This is what happens when the film industry puts such a story in the hands of a clumsy action hero. You get a Super Jesus, a man who can not only withstand being whipped by 280lb men with 2 inch thick batons for 10 minutes (enough to break a mere mortals back with a couple of blows), but then to take another 20 mins of whipping from whips that would strip the flesh off a pig in less than a minute. Oh, and then carry a tree sized cross up the side of a mountain whilst under a rain of blows until Carl Weathers is forced to help out and Burgess Meredith manages to get him back to the corner for a swill and spit, ready for the next round.No wonder all the old people walked out of the cinema, they wanted THE story, with love and hope and a message, not an Unbreakable ""bring it on"" messiah, struggling to his feet time and time again for another whipping.

1247,DataDroid,Powerful. Moving. Brutal.,9,28 February 2004,"I have seen The Passion of the Christ, and I must say it is indeed powerful, moving and brutal. As many of my friends know, I have a strong Christian faith, so this movie bears a great amount of emotional impact for me.I've known the story of the death and resurrection of Jesus practically since I was born, and I've heard graphic descriptions of the torture He endured, but as they say, a picture is worth 1,000 words. You can hear about Jesus being scourged, you can see a cat o' nine tails, but when you see one actually used to tear the skin off a man's body with no camera cutaway, it really hits home. I dare you not to wince when the whip gets stuck and is yanked out, taking bits of flesh with it.The Passion is unique in many respects. First it's an independent film that's seeing very wide release. Second, it has had almost no advertising, yet it's almost guaranteed to make well over $100,000,000. Third, it's filmed entirely in Hebrew, Latin and Aramaic, with subtitles (most of the time), giving it an unusually realistic feel, almost like a documentary at times.The acting is very good throughout. When Pontius Pilate asks his wife ""what is truth?' you feel sorry for him. When Mary runs to try to help her battered son as He stumbles under the weight of the cross, you feel her compassion and pain. Jim Caviezel does a good job portraying Christ, although he has few lines, he really looks like he is undergoing a great deal of suffering.Some have made allegations that The Passion is anti-Semitic, but I disagree. Just because some of the Jews act in a villainous manner does not mean all Jews are villains. I felt much more loathing for the pig-faced Roman soldiers who laughed gleefully as Jesus' blood spattered on them while they were scourging Him. The real villains in this movie are people. Greedy, power-hungry people. It doesn't matter if they are Jewish or Roman; they were simply despicable people. I am part Jewish myself, and I take strong offense at anything or anyone that is bigoted in some way, and I can assure you, no race was portrayed as worse than any other in this film, with the possible exception of the Romans, but even then, some were vile, and some were sympathetic; they were just people.Now for the bad. While I did find Passion to be moving and powerful, there were some points that I did not think were so great. One of these is the excessive use of slow motion. Although I understand the intent, to give gravity to a situation, it is somewhat overused in this film. Another gripe I have is that while The Passion was indeed intended to show the suffering of Christ, there was not enough mention made of His teachings beforehand. While it certainly drove home the point that Jesus suffered incredibly, it doesn't show enough of the (then) radical messages of love, acceptance, forgiveness and repentance that made those in power fearful enough to want to kill him. Finally, there was very little about the resurrection, the part of the story that shows that the rest was worthwhile. If Jesus had died and stayed dead, there would be little for Christians to trust, and Jesus would have been just another fanatic who fades into history soon after He dies.Overall though, I thought this movie was great. I gave it a 9/10, and recommend to anyone who thinks they can handle blood and mutilation to go see it, regardless of beliefs. If you are a Christian, it helps personalize the story you've known for so long. If you aren't, it gives a glimpse into just why we Christians hold Jesus in such high regard, and if nothing else, is an example of a well-directed movie made by someone with a true passion (no pun intended) for the source material.",The Passion of the Christ
1248,mtrinca,Highly recommended for Catholics everywhere,8,15 March 2004,"More of an experience than a movie, Mel Gibson's ""Passion of Christ"" really brings Jesus's crucifixion to life.  There are scenes that will make you shudder, some that will make you cry, and others that can deeply affect your perception of religion and Christ's sacrifice.But without commenting too much on the religious implications of the film, there are several items in the film that especially struck me.  First, there is a cloaked albino figure that appears in the shadows throughout the movie. One assumes that this is the devil, tempting Jesus.  ""The sins of humanity are too much for one man to bear,"" he states to Jesus while in the Garden of Gethsemane (sp?).  It's unclear what exactly the devil is trying to do, but I took it to be the temptation Jesus must have felt at that moment to take the easy way out and avoid being put to death.  Indeed, Jesus had several opportunities to dodge his death-sentence, but the movie makes it a point to show that he accepted his fate and saw his death as a sacrifice for the benefit of others.  ""See, I make everything new again,"" he says to his mother, Mary.  This I took to mean that he is trying to erase the sins of all peoples through his suffering.Besides the appearance of the devil, we also see lots of references to demons, especially in scenes involving Judas.  After turning in Jesus to the high priests, Judas begins seeing demons everywhere.  His appearance becomes marred with wounds and scratches, and it seems that this demonic possession is what drives him to kill himself.  I felt that Gibson wandered from the literal Bible account here.  He takes liberties, and while they never contradict the Bible, the additions of demons and devils give the story of Jesus a supernatural element that feels artificial.  The story is enough without these special effects and shock-tactics, and I felt as though Gibson added them just for entertainment value.There is a philosophical element to the movie, where Pontius Pilate asks Jesus, ""Que est veritas?"" (What is truth?)  This in response to Jesus saying, ""I am the way, the truth, and the light.""  These scenes between the Roman official and the Christ are very powerful, and I liked the way they were done.  Jesus stands before Pilate beaten and bleeding, but on equal ground.  You can see that Pilate respects Jesus and is curious.
Finally, I thought the treatment of Mary, mother of Jesus, was very well done.  She portrays a strong woman, with a sense of purpose and destiny. She accepts Jesus's fate and role as savior, yet she weeps and is deeply hurt by his suffering.  In an emotionally moving scene, she runs to her son after he falls carrying the cross, and we see a flashback to a time when Jesus was young and feel down.  She wants to pick him up and comfort him, like when he was a child.  ""I am here,"" she tells him.  Any mother could probably identify with her pain.  It's an amazing scene.Some people refuse to see the moving because they think it portrays the Jews in a negative light or because it is too gory (sp?).  But I think the movie gives everyone equal treatment.  There are good apostles and bad apostles, good Jews and bad Jews, good Romans and bad Romans, etc.  The gore is appropriate to paint an accurate picture of Jesus's suffering. He suffered one of the most painful executions known to Man.  Gibson does know go overboard a la ""Mad Max"".  On the contrary, I found it refreshing that, while some churches have substituted the Crucifix with the bloodied body of Christ with statues of the risen Christ on their walls, this movie dares to show the true nature of Christ's death.  While, I wouldn't recommend small kids go see this, I do think most Catholics do go.  It reminds us that God really did endure all this, so that He might know what it was to be human, to suffer and die a human.  Atoning for Mankind's sins is a lot to bear, but Gibson does a great job witnessing Christ's sacrifice, the sacrifice that ""made everything new"".",The Passion of the Christ
1249,dgfgl,The worst film I have seen this year,1,16 April 2004,"This is the worst movie I've seen this year without a doubt (and possibly in the last years). It has bad direction, bad acting, bad cinematography, etc. The only reason that has made popular this movie is that its about Jesus, and how it was killed. Try to see the movie with some perspective and you will see that I'm right. All the notoriety and controversy of the film is because Gibson (a christian integrist and a misogynous, be aware of this) has decided to give the audience some exagerated degree of violence and more reasons to hate each other. I don't think all this violence is needed to explain Jesuschrist history (you can see all the other Jesus films to see that I'm right). I thought that the message Jesus gave to the world was about love, and I don't see any love in this film, only hate, so I think that its safe to say that this is the worst adaptation of the life of Christ. I think taht even Monthy Pitton's is better than this one !!!! (not as a history movie of course, but it has more love in it than this one). So if you want to see only some recreation of the torture and the kill of Christ that's your movie, but if you want to know his message you have to search in some other place.

1250,hebsoz,A beautifully filmed Bible story.,8,2 March 2004,"Mel Gibson's personal zeal for this film is up there on screen for all of us to see.  The story of the final hours of Jesus Christ has been told many times on film but Mel's version is a truly beautiful expression of his faith. The film is, however, heart rending and at times very difficult to watch.  The musical score accompanies the suffering and the sorrow perfectly and the casting of James Caviezel  as Jesus is the most impressive since Jeffrey Hunter's ""King of Kings"". Maia Morgenstern as Mary is simply perfect.  She is a mother. Unfortunately, Mel Gibson has assumed that everyone who goes to watch his film knows the story of The Passion of The Christ.",The Passion of the Christ
1251,cutie_pie_kkk,disturbed,1,19 June 2007,this movie is not an award winning or even nominating movie. this movie really just shows the disgusting use of film that Mel Gibson feels he can do. this is a ridiculous movie to watch and going by the bible it hardly has some truth in it. there is too much prejudice and too much blood and guts in this to deem it worthy of spending two hours watching. it truly does hurt the eyes. Mel Gibson - you need to stop making movies that disturb 9 out of 10 people that watch them. i watched this movie in class at a co-ed school. there was not a single person that felt this movie needed to be viewed by the public. for it to have such a well-given name truly does disturb me. there will never be a need for this much violence about God. it truly is blasphemy,The Passion of the Christ
1252,nacmanpriscasellers,Moving and meaningful--but not for those who don't know the Gospels,6,17 April 2007,"I've watched this movie four times--about as many times as I've read all four gospels. Therefore, I can say without qualification that in order to truly have a clear understanding of Christ's life and ministry, read the Bible instead of renting ""The Passion of the Christ."" As one might expect, I got the most out of the movie in the first viewing, in the theatre three years ago; the second time, a year later at my church,I was also affected, but not so much. The third and fourth times I felt I was watching just about any other ""bloodfest"" film; if there had been more depth or a clearer message, I might have been able to enjoy it as much as before, but I really got very little out of it. I imagine it would be the same for anyone watching the film for the fourth time.Anyway, my main problem for a film made with the claim of being ""spiritually uplifting"" (paraphrasing Gibson) is that there is nothing life-changing or uplifting about ""The Passion"" if you are not already a committed Christian who knows the story, as well as has at least some understanding of the context behind the events. Watching the movie--and this is a complaint made in other reviews in this forum--you don't really have any idea why Christ is suffering; Gibson failed to provide any kind of background, and no, slipping in snippets of memories of His past life does not count. All we see is a man getting beaten half to death, and then crucified, for no apparent reason other than that he displeased the local religious leaders.Another problem is that considering the subject, the story being told is decidedly unbiblical; throwing in a handful of largely paraphrased Gospel quotes does not make it so. The story being told is, for the most part, taken straight out of Catholic liturgy and Mel Gibson's imagination. Scorsese's ""Last Temptation,"" even if it did contain wretched interpretations of the Gospels (and I'm not saying it did) at least never strayed from the basic biblical story. Gibson, on the other hand, seemed so concerned with re-enacting (and re-interpreting) Catholic mythology that he ended up creating a ""Gospel according to Mel Gibson."" He did not compensate in any way by including short scenes from Jesus' life throughout the film; many of these were out of context, such as the flashback to the Last Supper during the scene where Jesus is sprawled on the ground at his crucifixion site; at least one flashback, where Jesus was with his mother (obviously at a point before his ministry began) is added with no hint at all as to what it's supposed to mean.Also, as has been pointed out, most of the characters are completely lifeless, cardboard cutouts with few qualities the viewer can sympathize with. Jesus, of course, is an exception, but for the wrong reasons--nobody unfamiliar with the Gospels, as I said, would have any idea what the man stood for. Another exception is Pilate, who is actually portrayed as a man with a conscious, unsure of the correctness of his actions; pragmatically, he cares about ensuring the peace of the area (as well as ensuring his own survival), which ultimately drives him to submit to the will of Jesus' accusers even as he wrestles with the justice of their actions. If Gibson had chosen to focus more on the relationship and interaction between these two characters, rather than appealing to the worst instincts of his viewers, he might have made a better film.",The Passion of the Christ

Overly-sensitive types... nothing in the film to picket.  History is what it is.  The film is what it is... a brilliant work on a painful subject. Congratulations to Mr. Gibson on a work of genius.

Mr. Gibson could have played the part of Jesus himself, but had Mr. Caviezel portray the role. That role by Mr. Caviezel was excellent. The determination and stamina are hard roles to play, and Mr. Caviezel was completely convincing and unwavering. Other roles such as the sadistic Roman Guards beating the protagonist must be a hard role to do as well.  Mr. Gibson's movie tried very hard to ""tell it like it was"" and is close to the mark as we know it to be. I saw none of the anti-Semitism that others feared. If Producers of cinema start worrying about political tones and implications that are perceived, let alone real, no story will ever get told. The movie was well done, and serves the purpose it was meant to do: tell the story. The story has now been told.

1256,wgmimdb,Much better than I expected it to be,10,26 February 2004,"After all of the furor over this movie and with reviews chiding its violence, my expectations were low for this movie. However, the 20 minutes of the assault on Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan was a lot more violent and gory than this whole movie, at least from my perspective. The movie moved me, as I expected it to do, and there was a realistic quality about it that made me feel I was a participant. I remember how while watching Titanic I had to remind myself this was a movie and people weren't dying. This was similar in that respect.Maia Morgenstern was exceptional as Mary, as was Monica Bellucci as Magdalen. They said an awful lot with just a look. Some reviewers have commented on the Roman soldiers, how base and brutish they are portrayed. Those people obviously haven't been in the military, especially when stationed in what you see is a hellhole. Actually there was a wide range of behavior among the ""grunts"", including two who were moved and changed by the events in front of them. You have to remember that you don't get on the crucifixion detail, which was a regular occurence, unless you are low on the roster, probably a screwup. It was like latrine duty, the worst of the worst and only the worst got it. In addition, duty in Judea was almost a punishment in the first place. It was considered the armpit of the Empire. So I didn't see their actions as surprising.This is definitely a movie that I will own when it comes out on DVD and I will treasure it for years to come. I expect I will see it at least twice more while it is in theater.",The Passion of the Christ

I went to see this movie for 2 reasons.  1 because I enjoy Mel Gibson as an actor/director and 2 because of all the controversy.  Any movie that moves me emotionally as well as making me think is good.  This movie moved me to tears.  My wife said I shouldn't see it because it will make me cry.  After the movie I told her that I only cried once, about 15 minutes into the movie, however I didn't stop until the credits were rolling. This movie is amazing.  The acting, directing and cinematography is superb.  I would recommend this movie to everyone regardless of whether you believe or not.  The violence is real and shocking and maybe this is why there is so much controversy.  However I have seen more blood and violence in a number of other films e.g. Blade.

Although I can't instantly name the directors names of certain award-winning films I do can say what I don't like. I don't like The Passion of the Christ. (Period)What is the point? I would say money, nothing else but money. Throw in a load of money, build up the movie-making-machine and stir up the media so much that everyone is talking about the movie before its released. Perfect, free advertising. Send the message that its a religious movie and the bigger part of the world will be interested in going to the theatres. I bet there are people out there that never attended to theatres or very rare that did see this. Wow that makes alot of cash.The movie then. Well I just say it bluntly, the storyboard sux bigtime. There are just fragments and a hope that the audience has some background knowledge from the bible. The rest is just pain and gore. Its terrifying and its disgusting and yes it feels awful because u feel it to the bones that Jesus pain is mankinds fault. Still I dont like to have it in the face for over an hour.Pros to the languages the scenery and the music. Acting without much mono- nor dialog is hard but most of the main characters are done well.The rest I dont give much for. When I write this I recall Schindler's List whích on the other hand is one of the best movies ever.

1259,retcarahc,Where's a good Sunday School teacher when you need one?,2,10 August 2008,"I suppose Mel Gibson made this film with the idea that most people have an insufficient understanding and appreciation of how Jesus suffered in his passion. I'm afraid the film betrays Gibson's fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and meaning of our Lord's suffering. The physical torture Jesus suffered was heinous, but not singularly so. One need only read the history of the martyrdom of the saints, to find many more lengthy and physically brutal deaths.The completely remarkable nature of Jesus' suffering is that He, God incarnate, and therefore 100% good and pure, voluntarily bore the accumulated sins of all the people of the world, committed from the creation onward. It is this incomprehensibly horrendous torment experienced by the Christ that allowed we who are Christians an unearned and unmerited salvation and reconciliation with God.As a side note, any serious student of the Bible knows that the temple officials paid a small claque of Jews to scream for Jesus' crucifixion while the many thousands of Jews who followed and loved Jesus (and everyone else in Jerusalem) were still asleep.",The Passion of the Christ

The acting was phenomenal, as was the cinematography. The script had some flaws and was hard to believe at times, much like the fictional book the film is based on (The Bible). The highlight of the movie is really all the blood and gore. The effects are very realistic and well done. Overall it was an good flick to pass the time, but nothing very profound and nothing to be taken seriously in it. I thought Jesus Christ was a wimp. he should have stood up for what he believed in, fought back or something. Instead he just took it like a masochist.

A Jew fighting the Roman Empire single handedly and at the same time trying to reform his own religion. Can you possibly sin more than that?

1262,yippapookie@hotmail.com,Jesus Flavoured Fantasy,2,8 April 2004,"Most critiques of 'The Passion' have focused on the graphic violence and anti-semitic undertones of the movie and seem reluctant to justify their appraisals through analysis of the film itself. Which is probably a good thing for Mel and Co, since all the controversy and hype surrounding the film has successfully averted people from noticing that beneath its violent, religious facade, 'The Passion' is merely a B-grade Jesus flavoured fantasy movie, masquerading as historical truth.Without exception, all of the characters are drawn through cliche and worse than that, they play metonymical roles. The Jews are decadent, jealous and bloodthirsty. The women are weak, dominated and completely passive. The Romans are animalistic and barbaric drunkards. The characters and roles they play speak for a violent and patriarchal society, depicted in this film without sensitivity or social complexity. People speak of the immense emotional and psychological impact of this film yet for me it had all the emotional byplay of a Jerry Bruckheimer film. The cliched nature of the characters denies the audience any chance of empathising with their predicament. In such a case, i can only imagine that Gibson was relying on one of two factors to draw an emotional response. Firstly, through the sheer horror of the violence and secondly, through the use of Jesus not as a real character, but as a social symbol.This was not the most violent movie I have seen. 'Kill Bill' and 'Saving Private Ryan' were both shocking in their depiction of violence. 'Kill Bill', because of the utterly spiteful malice that was central to the plot. 'Saving Private Ryan', for the degree of human tragedy that flowed through the film. 'The Passion' however, relies only on the connection Gibson wants the audience to make between Jim Caviezel's performance and the social symbol of Jesus Christ. Those who claim the movie is powerful because it happened to a real person and because it is true ignore crucial issues. An astute viewer should realise that Realism in cinema can never objectively document experienced reality.  Jim Caviezel is not Jesus, no matter how high the production values or how realistic the props. Caviezel's character is a signifier for Jesus. He is Gibson's representation of Jesus and consequently at the will of Gibson's subjective interpretation. Where Gibson errs is by divorcing Caviezel's character from a relationship with the Christian message. Instead his preoccupation with meaningless gore leaves the characters empty.'The Passion' is not a bad movie because it is gory, nor because of its controversial subject matter. It is bad because it does not allow the characters themselves to speak. Instead, the protagonists and the audience are at the mercy of Gibson's self indulgent directorial dictatorship. Yet for some reason, the film continues to blitz the box office. Jesus, it seems, is the newest young star to hit hollywood. One can only hope that he can be cajoled into doing a sequel- that is after all the formula for all formulaic, market driven, big budget, commercial Hollywood blockbusters is it not?",The Passion of the Christ
1263,the_pope,A non-religious person's viewpoint,7,25 February 2004,"I've just returned from seeing The Passion of the Christ on day of release here in Australia. I wanted to see it because of my admiration for Jim Caviezel as an actor, and in support for Mel Gibson for his bravery to make this film.I am a non-religious person - indeed, I could only claim to be roughly acquainted with the story of Jesus, as tackled by this film. As a result, I found these past 2 hours not the most enjoyable of my cinema-going career. While I don't doubt it is ""accurate"", a large portion of this film is pretty damn grizzly. In addition, the insistence of using Aramaic / Latin for the dialogue rather than English made the ""story"" something of a chore - I have watched subtitled films before, but there seemed to be no particular gain in using this approach for The Passion of the Christ.Overall, I scored it 7 out of 10, mainly due to the superb acting, high production values and general polish. However, I will not be rushing to see it again, nor is there anything of note I could use to recommend it to my friends.",The Passion of the Christ
1264,gaborjoo,"I'm glad I watched it, but...",6,10 December 2007,"While watching this movie I couldn't help putting it in contrast with Scorsese's 'The Last Temptation of Chris'. For me, Scorsese's work is the ultimate movie about Jesus. Gibson's work is also well made, nice photography, Jim Caviezel plays his role as a true believer (and he is one), the way Satan is pictured in The Passion is probably the best (if that's the appropriate word..) I've ever seen. However, for my taste the movie is too one-sided and does not leave much room for further thinking and questions. It brutally shows how Jesus suffered and died and the torture-scenes are truly amazing.. in a very shocking way. Still, after the movie was over I didn't feel like I was really moved. The end credits were running and I thought 'OK, this is something that was good to watch because Mel Gibson did something remarkable with this, but I don't feel like I want to watch this again.' In my opinion nothing is hidden in the film, no tiny bits to look for, no questions left unanswered, everything is so visible; all the blood, the suffering, etc. This is way different than in any other Jesus-based films but for me maybe this is why I don't think I will ever watch The Passion again. I, for one, prefer those movies that tell more by showing less, if you know what I mean. Anyway, this is one of those films you gotta see at least once in order to have an opinion.

1271,larry_sherrod,A Movie above All Movies,10,19 March 2004,"The BUZZ in Hollywood has been silent for the past few weeks regarding the film, `The Passion of the Christ'.  It seems the outrage and fervor against the movie had an effect on the ticket buying public.  It sent them to the theaters in unprecedented numbers.  Just to put it in perspective, `The Passion' now ranks at number 23 on the Top Grossing Movies of All Time at the USA Box Office.  This is unheard of for a movie that has been out for less than one month.  With its current momentum, it is likely to reach the top 10 list within the next 3 weeks.  With the Easter season approaching, it is highly likely to reach within the top 5.I recently spoke with my parents about the movie.  They had not seen a movie in a theater in over 14 years.  They were moved and touched by it.  They had difficulty describing the experience.  Having not been exposed to the grime and gore of the typical Hollywood buffet of movies for so long a time had left them too sensitive.  It was not a movie they wished to see but one they felt they needed to see.  This is an aspect of the Christian soul Hollywood will never understand.I feel the need here to confess my own experience.  I had not wished to see the movie.  When the time arrived my wife and three teenage children loaded into the family van and headed to the theater.  Unlike all other times, we were silent.  Even at the normally loud and busy movie complex, you could tell the atmosphere was hushed and reverent, as if at church.  We filed in and to our seats.  Since it was an early show, the theater was about three-quarters full.  Our seats were in the center and closer than we normally like.  We had missed the previews and I was glad not to have the distraction.  I won't go through the details of the scenes because each of you should experience it for yourselves.  I will say that shortly into the movie the emotional anvils began to drop on my chest.  I had tried to mentally prepare myself for this but it was no use.  I was captured into the scenes.  The words the actors spoke were songs.  English would have failed. If there had been no subtitles, the story would still have all its meaning. As history played out on the screen, I was not as shocked by the violence of it as I was moved by the beautiful emotion.  Our God had become human and in doing so developed a deeper love of us.  He felt the feelings we feel, experienced his creation as we do and faced his deepest fear.  Not a fear of pain or death but the knowledge that God (his Father) would have to turn from him and for a brief time become totally alone; alone while the weight of a world's sin was dropped upon you.  Jesus never knew what it was like to be alone from God.  That is the cup he wanted to pass from him.
My wonderful wife had thought ahead enough to bring extra tissue and I made use if it.  My soul wanted to wail and cry out but I felt a father's responsibility to not expose my children to such an impression.  I held in as much as I could and my wife's tissue took care of the rest.  I won't give away the ending but if you can't see the movie, read the book.What has caused this?  Of course this movie cuts deep within the flesh of Christian America, deep into our nerve.  It touches sentiment and soul to arouse a `Passion' long too dormant. Each of us is a visual spirit.  The sensation of sight affects our minds more than the oral eloquence of the finest evangelist or the most beautiful words laid down by pen.  We lose ourselves in movies.  We are enveloped by the experience and store it alongside our most cherished memories.  And when a movie such as this nestles itself beside our most treasured experience, salvation, we can't help it.  We are overwhelmed by the experience.  We become part of it because we know who denied him, carried out the beating, screamed to crucify him and drove the nails.  We did it ourselves.  Every Christian understands this and there is nothing anti-Semitic about it.Lately I check the IMDB.com site every Monday to see the new results.  I wonder how Hollywood will deal with this situation.  It's a bit like an elephant taking up residence in your home.  It's too big to ignore and difficult to make go away.  I for one have decided to make the movie a milestone for all other movies.  I will now refer to movies as BP (before Passion) or AP(after Passion).Larry Sherrod Movie Critic",The Passion of the Christ
1272,tony1217a,A Masterpiece,10,29 February 2004,"Mel Gibson has produced the most powerful and intense film I have ever seen. In essence he has recreated the stations of the cross in graphic detail. After about 20 minutes, the grip of the film tightens like a noose and never lets you go.  What I found particularly effective were the flashback sequences detailing the teachings of Christ, such as forgiveness, which served as an excellent contrast to the brutality displayed and the overall meaning of the cross.The performances are all top notch as well as the cinematography.  It is as if you are there witnessing the Passion of Christ.  All I know is that I have never before have left a movie theater upset.  Its amazing to me that spectacles such as Return of the King pale in comparison.   This is a cinematic triumph for Gibson.",The Passion of the Christ
1273,awood2002,Excellent - a true portrayal of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life,10,1 April 2004,"This film's excellent. It's a true portrayal of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life from the Last Supper (shown in one of the flashbacks) to the Crucifixion. I've read the story of the Crucifixion in the Bible, and this movie is faithful to that story, including the very graphic violence. The performances were very good. Jim Caviezel portrayed Jesus very well. I am a Christian, and I think Jesus would be honored to be portrayed the way he was in this movie. I will be seeing this again, because it's worth it. Well done Mel Gibson - 10/10 (Excellent)",The Passion of the Christ
1274,andydecepida,For the Greater Glory of Mel Alone,1,26 February 2004,"The film is orgiastic in its unrelenting violence.  As a Catholic, I found it disturbing that the Passion could be portrayed so out of context of His ministry as well as His majesty.  While Gibson keeps saying he wanted to portray it accurately, it is obvious that he chose to foist his own sado-masochistic bent (at least as he's been portrayed on film) and pervert the Divine.  He railed against detractors and yet the merits of the film (artistic, historical and/or theological) are extremely suspect.  I can only call it an abomination since it will only appeal to those who enjoy violence at this level and din -- as long as it is devoid of context.  Gibson may have only meant it for Christians who already know that context however to leave it out entirely because it is convenient?  To those who think we need this narrow view of what happened to jog our memories as to who Jesus died for, they need more than just the visuals which this film can deliver. They'll need help if they need the material assistance and not instead see the truth that lies in their hearts.Gibson and his media machine made it controversial.  He needed it to be controversial because it was the way to promote a mediocre but ambitious attempt.  Never mind the merchandising that follows, good hearted individuals ought not bother with this film because it accomplishes nothing but glorify not God but Mel -- and does he really need anymore?",The Passion of the Christ
1275,bertiemk,"Too much blood and gore, not enough story",6,20 December 2004,"I rented this movie expecting to be moved by what is, or should be, the greatest story ever. Instead I felt that there was too much emphasis on the violence, and too little on the characters. I was detached from the people, and torn between the desire to turn off and to see it through to the end. During the chastisement scene, the implements of torture, which could tear into a wooden table, and used for such a length of time would surely have ripped his body apart - not just left him with a patchwork of cuts. I felt too that the limited special effects, ie the earthquake which wrecked the temple were unconvincing more befitting of a B movie from the 50's.",The Passion of the Christ
1276,greatwhitehype13,I don't like this movie. I guess I'm a disgusting person...,1,24 March 2004,"I walked into The Passion of the Christ with no expectations.  On the one hand, I thought it would be terrible.  A sorry excuse for Mel Gibson to get his name in the headlines again.  On the other, I thought he might have made a powerful, emotional film that could touch peoples lives.  Well...  In my opinion, it was a cheesy, overdramatic, boring excuse for Mel Gibson to think of himself as a deep and spiritual man.  I'll admit, there were points in the movie where I was entertained, but that's simply not enough. Christians deserve more than this!  This film (and by the way people, that's all it is, a film.  wait, it's not even a film, it's a hollywood movie) made me want to barf.  Something as important as a widely believed religion should not be taken so lightly as it was in this movie.  Mel Gibson tries to say the holy ghost directed this, but would the holy ghost be so amateur as to put a slow motion shot of jesus falling with a painful look on his face in every 10 minutes of the movie???  And how about that torture scene that took up half the movie...  George Lucas said it best:  ""Anyone can get tears from the audience.  All you have to do is get a kitten on the screen and wring it's neck"".  In this case the kitten is Jesus.  Gibson said he wante d the film to be real, but that scene was beyond real.  It was eccentric and exagerated.  Why?  So people would talk.  So people would go see it, and so he would make money.  So Mel, the holy ghost directed this film eh?  You gonna share and of the millions you make???",The Passion of the Christ

This movie is remarkable, simple as that. It has subtitles, but this movie is such a work of art with marvelous acting that you don't need to read them! What an achievement, it's mind boggling.I read somewhere that this movie was 90% gore, which put me off somewhat, the person who said that had either not watched the movie or had simply lied, it is hard work sometimes watching this movie, but it's not all blood and gore it's actually quite an accurate depiction of what Jesus went through, with some artistic licenses used to depict flashbacks that make the movie more complete. This is possibly the best movie about Jesus yet, none of this blonde hair blue eyed stuff, this is a nitty gritty movie which centres around realism and it pulls it off with style.My mother thought that this movie was amazing(and I agree), and that's the ultimate compliment. Even if you're not a Christian, you will get something from this movie, hopefully something positive.10/10",The Passion of the Christ

The Passion of The Christ depicts the last twelve hours of Christ's life.  I thought it was well done.  Of course it's violent and full of gore, the story of Christ's persecution is violent and full of gore. It is not for young eyes to view, hence the R rating.  Besides the gore, the understanding of why he was crucified, the relationship he had with his disciples and his mother, the reality of the time in which this all took place is too difficult for children to understand.  Everyone will have their own reason for seeing it and will have their own reaction to seeing it. Most people know the story.

Better read the Bible or a Harry Potter Book. But don't waste your time on that nonsense. There are a dozen more good bible Films you should see. What's the special on this one??? The violence?

Anyone who finds it offensive should judge the film for its art and nothing else, and respect the guts it showed. True art, inspiring, and real, everything the story of Jesus should be. It's not as violent as made out to be by gutless critics, at one point it is hard to watch, but the gore is nescassary at the point, it makes you respect what this man real or not, really went though. It's one of the most real films I've ever seen. The effect of using the accurate languge was a great effect, which made the film all the more powerful.

1281,pureindierock,"Brutal? Anti-semitic? No, boring if anything.",1,31 March 2004,"As threatened, a trip was made yesterday to see the Mel Gibson Vanity Project, and it was, indeed, a cinematic atrocity of the first water. I hope that Mel Gibson puts my £4.50 towards a course of therapy to sort out his diseased brain. It wasn't quite as hilarious as I'd been hoping. Don't get me wrong, it was bad, but only on a few occasions was it funny-bad. Those being the bit where he invents the dinner table and splashes his mother playfully with water, and the bits with demon children, which put this ""biblical epic"" firmly in the arena marked ""zombie B-movie"". (I dunno if you've seen it, but I really wouldn't bother if I were you - Three on a Meathook and Zombie Holocaust were far more noble cinematic efforts than this, I'd imagine).The violence is enormously tiresome. It may have been the case that the violence meted out to Jesus was, in real life, that extreme. That may well be Gibson's justification for the graphic nature, and the prolonged scenes of flagellation. However, if he wanted to make the film a true historical document he missed the fact that Jesus was not nailed through the hands, but through the wrists. Gibson also includes a ludicrous Satan figure who is present throughout the film. The acting, too, is quite breathtakingly awful. Jim Caviezel gets beaten and says little, but he doesn't do it too badly. Monica Belluci hams it up but this is allowed because she's gorgeous. The other actors gurn and overcook things, particularly the Jewish characters who might as well have ""EVIL"" tattooed on their foreheads. The actor playing Judas even literally chews the scenery at one point, while all around him are doing so metaphorically.There is no way in which it is a good film. As a historical telling it is worthless. As a narrative it is hugely flawed. As a source of controversy which will line Mel Gibson's pockets, it has done its duty, but I have seen weather forecasts that pushed my artistic buttons more than this piece of garbage.",The Passion of the Christ

1283,todd6559,Silence Screams Film's Impact,10,25 February 2004,"Kudos to Mel Gibson for the production of this tremendous film - a film that not only accurately portrays the sadistic cruelty of a Roman crucifixion in the first century A.D., but also clearly relates the steadfast resolve of Jesus to suffer such a death as the sacrifice that solved humanity's sin problem.Thousands exited the sold out cinema in silence - a silence that screamed volumes about the impact of this film upon its audience.  I give this film a 10 for its life changing impact.At the same time, I am disappointed at the somewhat stereotypical portrayal of some of the characters; most notably, the `tormented and misunderstood' Judas, the `wimpy' Pilate, the `controlling' Caiaphas, and `powerful partner' Mary, the mother of Jesus.   Even more disappointing is the feeling I often got that Mel was `preaching to the choir' in the sense that much of the powerful truth of this good news about Jesus was revealed only to those who already knew the Biblical accounts.*** ALERT *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ***For example, the specific earthquake damage to the temple and the reaction of the religious leaders is part of the evidence of Jesus' victory cry: `It is accomplished.'  Sad to say, exactly what was accomplished and what the earthquake damage had to do with it was lost in the storytelling of this film.  Also, the abbreviated resurrection scene only hinted at the real impact of Jesus' accomplishment.*** END OF SPOILERS ***Still, in all, this powerful film certainly portrays the passionate suffering of Jesus on our behalf.  I hope you will go and see this film.",The Passion of the Christ
1284,lucas_4,Very moving; Very Accurate,10,27 February 2004,"I have seen a lot of movies. I have seen everything from ""Citizen Kane"" to ""Schindler's List"". And no movie to date has left an impression on me like this.Yes, this movie is an extremely bloody. It had to be. Quite frankly, the Bible says that Jesus went through torture that isn't even comprehendable. Well, since Mel Gibson comprehended this, it must have been much worse. Overall though, Jesus was beaten to a pulp by the time he got to the cross. Of course, as any Christian knows, he wasn't thinking about his pain. He kept his faith in the father. This proves ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a very fitting title.Spoilers HereinNow, on to the cynics. Neither the Romans or the Jewish people killed Jesus. Pontious Pilate didn't kill him. Caiaphus didn't do it. We ALL did it, as it alludes to in the Bible.Now, as far as how Jesus made it to the cross, the Pharisees found Jesus threatening because he was a revolutionary; he didn't see eye-to-eye with the pharisees. And due to this, he threatened the power of the pharisees. Judas found him for them, and they asked Pilate to execute him.
This is where many people start to question this movie. And, my answer to them is quite simple. Pontious Pilate was systematically manipulated into crucifying Jesus. Pilate never saw why Jesus was guilty (nobody did, really), and he questioned why the pharisees wanted him crucified. That was very true the bible. Only when Jesus said to Pontious that he wouldn't be in as much trouble as the people who turned him in, he then sentenced him to crucifiction, and washed his hands. Pilate is a very intriguing character in this story, obviously, from the movie perspective, one of the more interesting characters in the movie. He wasn't weak, he just had really no way out. He had pressure on all sides; from pharisees, from Caesar, and from other directions too.All those who think that this is anti-Semetic because the movie shows that Pilate wanted nothing to do with Jesus (which is in line with what the Bible says), and Caiaphus kept asking for a crucifiction, are dead wrong. This movie is not anti-Semetic.Overall, I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.10\10",The Passion of the Christ
1285,clancybkj,Stunning Work despite the contoversy,9,15 February 2013,"I first saw this as a requirement for a world religion's course in school. I half knew what to expect, or thought I did because my grandfather saw it and liked it. It is one of those films you can enjoy even though you know exactly whats coming next. What i feel Gibson did best was to really recreate Jerusalem in front of us and made all the characters excluding Christ more human to us. The movie covers the entire Passion, which is almost a micro-journey through the whole span of Christendom. We come to see who Jesus really was through his darkest moments and the flashbacks highlight key moments in his ministry. Sorry for the spoilers, but the movie contains amazing sequences such as Mary staring down Satan, Mary rushing to protect a falling Jesus, the Last Supper cutting in with the rising of the cross, and Jesus' resisting Satan's temptation. I am well aware of the controversy surrounding this film, though I think most people accuse it for something it isn't. It is very brutal and violent (definately not something for Sunday school) but i would not go as far as calling it gore. I am no expert, but experts have said that what Jesus would have experienced would have been very brutal, though Gibson may have taken some liberties with that. When the film was through though i felt like i had witnessed something special; the triumph of the human spirit.",The Passion of the Christ
1286,roaldsen18,Crazy Critics!!!!,10,28 February 2004,"I have been reading many critics responses to 'The Passion' over these last few days. What I find startling is their virtual non-grasp on the entire film. Have they even seen it? I have a list of problems with what they say. First- I have seen the film twice in a theater with an audience. Have they? In both experiences the feeling in the theater was palpable. While much of the violence is hard to watch and graphically disturbing, not one person left the theater in horror, as many critics predict they will.Second- This film has not billed itself in any way as being about the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth. Therefore comparisons to works by Zeffirelli and Scorcese are unfair. This film is about ""The Passion of the Christ,"" the last twleve hours of his life. The filmmakers intersperse much of the violence with flashbacks to various points in the life and teachings of christ. They do not however overwhelm what the filmmaker set out to do.Third- As a viewer I did not see the anti-semitism describe by so many of our nations critics. Is their an inherent battle between good and evil in this film? yes. Is that a common aspect of a major motion picture drama? yes. While the villains in this story happen to a select group of Jewish high priests, and Roman soldiers, they represent the evil in mankind.This film carries a powerful message and seems to touch all who see it. I urge everyone along with the nations critics to go see the film and judge for yourself. See it with a real audience and feel the overwhelming reaction, not to the violence, or the act, but the message and experience.",The Passion of the Christ

If anyone out there does not know if they want to watch it take it from me watch it it is worth seeing even if you don't like blood and gore go watch it its worth the money i payed for.

Every second scene we see in slow motion, can anyone explain why? Is Mel G. actually less creative than Uwe Boll? I believe so. And why Jesus spoils more red liquid than bartenders during Wurstmarkt? Is he a whale or human for (nomen omen) God's sake? Acting's terrible, especially soldiers and women are laughable. Roman soldiers act like students after prom, laughing like idiots and Maria doesn't really care that her child is being slaughtered like swine (or whale considering amount of blood he loses).

1289,chandlerbingco,"Strikingly accurate depiction, very humbling",10,28 February 2004,"The first comment that needs to be made is, where was the anti-semitism? After the intense bashing the media gave The Passion, I fully expected to find this movie laden with examples of anti-Jew and super pro-Christian connotations and slurs.  The simple fact is, they don't exist.  It's simply the story told in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and is accurate to the accounts given in the Bible with only a light Hollywood interpretation thrown in at the times that the Bible does not dictate the exact circumstances.Someone on this board said that the Roman flogging of Christ was unrealistic and that ""nobody could stand after 10 minutes [of it], but Jesus stands anyway.""  Apparently that was the only problem the reviewer could find with this film - so feel free to capitalize off of it.  If you ask me, Jesus standing up after the flogging (barely standing and beaten to a pulp) shows the strength of His love for His fellow humans.  It signifies the amount of trust He had in the Father and His willpower to overcome his proscribed torture.  Anything less would be unrealistic and would obviously pander to the previous reviewer's contempt for a Christian storyline.This movie, while wholly bashed in the media and among liberal pundits alike, is probably one of the things that scares the liberals the most. God forbid a Christian story be told to a mass audience!  That would wreck the God-free society we're trying to maintain!  Heaven forbid a belief in something other than ourselves!The next time you read a negative review of this movie that classifies it as anti-semitic, racist, unrealistic, or otherwise worthlessly discreditable, think to yourself, ""Is the reviewer a Christian-hater, or is this an honest opinion?""  For many who have reviewed this movie negatively, I believe you'll find the answer to be the former.Mel Gibson did a heck of a job with this one, and The Passion is widely Bible-accurate and very much pro-Christian (but is definitely not anti-everything else).  It does not discriminate against other beliefs as many have said (even before it was released, mind you) and it is full of faith and enlightenment.  Mel Gibson and each of the actors has my full support - they did a fantastic job.",The Passion of the Christ
1290,crow_fanatic,"Before The World Hated Me, They Hated HIM",10,30 March 2004,"This movie is the best movie I have seen in my entire life.  I had heard so much hype and so much promise about this movie, and even still, just as many arguments and negative points about it, that I had mixed feelings about watching it.  But I finally decided, that as a practicing Christian, it could do me no harm to put a visual aide with what I already believed to be true.Never in my wildest dreams or in the deepest realms of my imagination could I have predicted what I was going to see on that movie screen.  I tried to prepare myself mentally, telling myself that I was not going to cry...no matter what.  But that goal was tossed aside the minute the first blow was delivered to His body.  I was a weepy wreck from that moment on...I sat in stunned silence as I saw what I believe to be an accurate depiction of what my Saviour went through for ME.This is the one movie by which all others in my life will be compared.  I have always been a huge fan of films, and my taste in movies varies day to day.  But this one made me feel things that even a combination of my top ten favorite movies could not accomplish together: Fear, Pain, Anger, Bewilderment, Disbelief, Hatred, Heartache, Shame, Agony, Anguish, Amazement, Passion, Sorrow, Pride, Love, and a ton of other emotions ran through me during my viewing...This film made me ache in places I didn't know I had, made me feel things I'd long since forgotten about, and made me remember things I chose to forget.I felt like I was there, just as one of the spectators.  There were several times during the beatings and whippings where I came within an inch of standing up and shouting for them to stop.After it was over, (and the ending, I must say, was the most wonderful thing I've ever seen, and I thought my heart would jump out of my chest, I can't recall another time I have felt such pride) I had to sit for a few moments and gather my thoughts before I was able to stand up and leave the theater.
Upon my exit, I took notice of the other viewers in the theater.  I saw one man, one teenage boy, and one woman, still sitting in their seats, not looking at anything, but staring straight ahead.  I don't know where they were at that moment, but my guess would be that they were right there, on the mountain, with the crosses.  It's safe to say they weren't in that theater at that moment.When we left the theater, there was complete silence.  No one said a single word.  No one had to.  Even the movie theater employees all stopped, and watched us exit.  I raised my eyes to meet those of a young man that worked there, and in that instant, I knew he had also seen the movie, and he knew exactly how I felt inside.This may not be the film equivalent of an epiphany that some people expected.  It may not hold the secrets of life, or give us a guide by which to live it...but if a movie can make someone be still from the inside out, then it has accomplished it's goal.As someone else said here at IMDB....I'm sorry I forgot.  So very sorry...
Thank you, Mel Gibson, for making something so incredibly amazing and touching.  This movie is perfect, and nothing whatsoever should be edited, changed, or left out.  The subtitles made it simply brilliant.And to all the nay-sayers out there that have bad things to say about this movie...you watched it...but you didn't SEE it.Thank you.",The Passion of the Christ
1291,yorkrandir,All Style... no content.,4,31 March 2004,"(Possible Spoilers)The Passion of the Christ is a confusing film. It had the potential to work on so many different levels, and to transmit the story of Christ to many new people. It also had the potential to inflame and upset. Ultimately it failed to meet any of these potentials, at least for me. I feel I should put myself in context here. I am not a Christian, nor do I follow any other religion. I was educated at a Catholic school, and am studying archaeology at university, so I feel that in some ways I am qualified to talk about aspects of religion and of history. I know the Gospels and I know the history, religious and otherwise, of the area.Having said this, I entered the cinema not really expecting anything.So for me the film was a confusing experience. To take the positives first, Gibson has created a quite stunning work of art. The majority of the film is beautifully shot, the soundtrack is stunning, the acting is terrific, and the prosthetic and digital effects are flawless. The recreation of period spoken Aramaic and Latin is also, as far as I could tell, flawless... certainly in the same league as the linguistic work done for Lord of the Rings. Often it is said that truly great art is done by those who do it for the greater glory of whatever they believe in, and the beauty of this film is certainly testament to Gibson's belief in his subject matter. However, the film really falls down when it comes to making an emotional connection with the viewer. For a start this film assumes that you are familiar with the Gospels. For those who have not read the relevant part of the Bible, the film does not make much sense. Why do they hate Jesus so? There is no relevant context for his death. The film then becomes the persecution of this one innocent man, and his forgiveness of his persecutors. This in itself is perhaps a worthy aim for a film, to show forgiveness in the face of everything. But Gibson's relentless punishment of Jesus, and his showing us every wound and insult make it difficult to see through to this. The lack of a real motive for his punishment also takes away from the overall effect. If we were shown what Jesus was teaching and why the Jew's were so incensed with him, expecting a warrior King and receiving a preacher of Peace, we would better understand the point of all that suffering. And I can only make this critique because I have been educated to some extent in Christianity. For those not familiar with the Old and New Testaments none of this is immediatly obvious. Which brings me on to the next point. Gibson's constant portrayal of Jesus' suffering is unnesesary, and de-sensitises most of the audience to the violence very quickly, or else forces the more squeamish to leave. By the time we get to the part of the film where the cat-o-nine tails are brought out we are used to the suffering and the blood. It may still upset us, it may still make us feel sorry for Jesus... but it doesn't startle or shock us anymore. What made the violence in Schindler's List so upsetting, horrifying and emotionally engaging was the way Spielberg showed very few moments of actual violence, instead concentrating on the effect that violence was having on other characters, or showing the aftermath of the violence. When the nails are struck into Jesus' hands and feet on the cross is one of the few moments when actually showing the violence is really nessecary, and by the time Gibson gets us there we are no longer shocked at this violent act. It may be horrible to watch, but it is no more emotionally shocking than when Derek hammers a knife into the foot of an alien in Bad Taste. Which is a great shame.This film could have been a great film. It had the potential to have even non-believers crying in their seats, such is the power of the story of Jesus. But it needed context. There is no death without life, and to understand the ultimate sacrifice we needed to understand the life of a great man. This film had the potential to educate, but in the end it did not. I did not come out of the film feeling any different emotionally from when I went it. To get anything out of this film you need to have gone into it with something. Christians going in will come out stronger Christians. Anti-semites will come out stronger anti-semites (though they will have missed the point entirely, since the one strong message the film seems to have is to forgive). Non-believers will come out still not believing. And film lovers will come out thinking ""that could have been so much more"". Overall, The Passion of the Christ is an example of 'All Style... no content'. A beautiful piece of art for the most part, but with not enough content to make an emotional contact with any viewer who does not go into the cinema with part of that contact already in place.",The Passion of the Christ

So please, should you see this movie, be mindful of anti-semitic content.",The Passion of the Christ
1293,SchockerGD,Wow,10,26 February 2004,"I'm still effected from the 7:00pm Wednsday showing of The Passion.By far, it was the most emotional movie I've seen. Only once before this was I *almost* brought to tears, but I believe I cried atleast an hour.I know there have been alot of people attacking the violence, or anti-semitisim of this movie...My opinion is this.Parts of the movie could be deemed 'Anti-semetic', however, the movie, by nature, redeems itself. We see the Priests falsely accuse Jesus, himself a Jew. We see Roman hate of the Jewish people. Yet in the same movie, we see Simon of Cyrene, a Jew that helps Jesus carry the cross - a task that He himself couldn't of accomplished in that marred state. Even at Jesus' weakest state, we see compassion from him - an almost in-human trait in today's world.I think that's the main lesson anyone that has seen this movie can learn, Christian or Atheist - Compassion. Knowing that the way he died is FACT not FICTION, we can see the brutality of an old system (similar to what we saw in Gladiator). During the movie, we see Jesus still showing compassion, both for his accusers, attackers, and everyone else, backing up his preaching with practise. If the whole world addopted just that teaching of Jesus, blessing those who persecute you, the world would be the paradise everyone would want.I think anyone attacking this movie was too appauled by the 'violence' (which was less than what you'd see in Kill Bill or pretty much any gory horror movie like Freddy vs. Jason) to get the message of love despite the pain and tourture that He went through.The acting was pretty decent, considering no A-list actors. There were weak points, and strong points in the acting and directing, but the overall coherence was there all the time. Jim Caviziel's preformance matches Rosalinda's preformance, even for the stark contrast they are to eachother - Jesus and Satan. Both were very good. Some were bothered by the choice of a female Satan, after watching her, it was the most briliant thing ever approached to the account of the Gospels.And finaly, was it true to the Gospels? Yes. As I was nearly ready to pull out my King James in my back pocket during the movie to 'approve' or disapprove of it, I never felt the need, as the coherence of the Gospels was felt during the whole movie.As my last comment, I'm saddened by the fact that people want to attack this movie without justification. There are nearly 100 movies that are more violent, there are 100 movies more anti-semetic, there are 100 movies that were more perverted of the Gospel than this. Alot of critics ask ""Where is the love that Christianity promotes?"" It was there, when Jesus didn't say a word during the beatings, it was there in the flashbacks (Sermon on the Mount). I have no clue as to why it wouldn't promote love. Regardless of religion, the idea of not lashing out at your accusers is a powerful, loving thing to do. If you can't get that, then I truely wonder about your love.",The Passion of the Christ
1294,CoolDog01,The Worst Movie Ever Made!!!,1,16 August 2010,"I admit it, i am tired of people going on about how inspiring this movie is. THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST PILE OF CRAP EVER MADE! The scenes are extremely graphic and disturbing. But what's even worse is the fact this movie literally has no plot. It's just some guy getting tortured for 2 hours with no plots, tense, thrilling moments or climaxes or stuff like that. As i have said before, it is just some guy getting tortured for 120 minutes. It has completely no structure. Mel Gibson as director wasn't as bad as i have thought. The former action stars decision to actually do this movie was actually the bad thing since his career basically ended after lethal weapon 4. This movie is heavily gore driven meaning you could basically call this movie a modern day horror flick, it has a lotta gory torture scenes that are no where near as good the ones in saw & to top that off, all the settings are constructed poorly. The script was just a couple of lines that make completely no sense together. There was for some reason a whole religion based around this crappy movie that is worse than the room, disaster movie & even battlefield earth. Viewing from the perspective that i do when watching bad, low budget & straight to video movies, i am just shocked that this thing is worse than all of those. They tried to make this inspiring & emotional but ended up making the worst box office disaster ever that has been called by more than just 1 critic, the worst movie ever. So just to conclude in CAPS, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE, MOVIES HAVE PLOTS. EVEN DOCUMENTARIES.",The Passion of the Christ

It was a very touching movie..it reminded of how God suffered such excruciating pain only for us...for me..Mel Gibson did a fantastic job here.He not only portrayed the way it should be but also did not over do anything.Yes,the movie did convey a lot of details which occurred during the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus on earth.James Caviezel did a wonderful job.He acted very well throughout the movie and portrayed the role of Jesus softly.Maia Morgenstern on the other hand did a fantastic job as Mary.She acted just as the way a mother would react on loosing her son.Yes its not ""Saw like"" because its not Saw and neither is it Horror.do check the GENRE.all in all...if Ur a Jesus fan..u definitely must watch it...if Ur not...then do watch it..you will surely become !!i rate the movie 10/10 !!",The Passion of the Christ
1296,Vanquish6383,Thoughts on the content of the passion,10,27 February 2004,"Saw the film yesterday, and just wanted to make a few comments seeing as how it has caused so much conflict right here on the site. 1. I thought that the movie did its job well. This was not a fun movie to watch. You werent watching a movie about jesus but rather and execution of jesus. It was brutal, it was violent, and it was altogether necessary. 2. The film was not anti-semitic to anyone willing to accept the facts of the situation. Jesus was a jew killed by jews. Seems logical to me that anti-semites could only be satisfied by this film if they were self depreciating. The pharisees in the temple period, most notably the leaders such as Annas and Caiphas were not nice men. They were politicians, and they were cunning, ruthless, and afraid of getting their asses handed to the by the Roman government 3. This film was needed because every other Jesus film has been either a lesson in theatrical translation or a five hour marathon you would never want to watch. This film was only two hours, and had more impact than any of the previous films documenting the life and execution of Jesus 4. Theologically, the film is correct whenever possible. This is especially true of Gibson's employment of the ancient languages, as it makes the film much more powerful to a christian because that is the way the words sounded...Not that the words were his exact, no doubt the bible has taken some artistic liberty itself, but at least we now see how jesus would have sounded in his language, and the words are much more powerful.Just a few thoughts, cant wait to see who argues with me...",The Passion of the Christ
1297,CarnalForge,A passionate attempt,1,16 April 2004,"I went to see the movie with an open mind.... I came out feeling somewhat unfulfilled.  The fundamental problem with this film was the story itself, dont get me wrong, there is nothing in my mind that is wrong with making a movie based on religous doctrine; indeed many scriptures do provide with some rather intriguing stories. However, basing the entire film on the last twelve hours of Jesus's life was to me, quite brave in its milder sense. There were no twists or turns, no epic climaxes, apart of course, from the actual crucifixtion. The fact that Jesus was beaten to a pulp kind of got tiresome after the gazillionth slash, and I lost count of the number of times Jesus fell in slow motion while carrying his crucifix. I dont normally talk during movies, but I do recall having various conversations with some bloke who seemed to have been counting the number of un-popped corn seeds he had left.And, sure give it a 10, but this would better indicate its boredom threshold requirement(BTR).",The Passion of the Christ
1298,sj_sulli09,Unforgettable,5,17 April 2004,"I just saw this film about a week ago, and I have to say, I was very moved. It is truly excellent. It is spoken in Aramaic throughout, a nice touch, and the casting was beautiful. The sets, the costumes, all very nice. Mel Gibson has directed another great film. The violence is heavy, and I wouldn't recommend anyone under the age of 13 seeing this. Well, you really just have to know your kids. All in all, a very good movie. I don't think it is in time for the awards, but it might be around. It is an excellent movie. The film starts with him in the garden, but has numerous flashbacks to other past events. It is a very good epic. Sometimes very hard to watch. The whipping scene may be unsettling to some viewers.10/10",The Passion of the Christ
1299,brophyliketrophy,What a really crappy movie.,1,25 February 2004,"Hey everyone!I just think this is a really bad movie.  And I am afraid it will be sold to people around the world and may even be revered just because of the subject matter.I am not making any statement about religion.  I just think it is a really poor film.Here's why...The music is incredibly melodramatic and cornball swelling to great moments of Hollywood cheese.The cinematography is forced and contrived, when it is in focus that is. Also, It is lit very unimaginatively and does not capture the sense of being anywhere other than on a sound stage.Jesus' CGI at times or contact lensed eyes are weird and not comforting at all.The brutality is done to an extent that is unbelievable and also ruins the impact of the crucifixion.  Making it seem like benevolence on the Romans part when they finally kill him on the cross.And, how hokey is the devil wandering around in the crowds?  Or the goofy shot of him screaming in hell at the end.Or the final nail holes in Jesus' hands for the corny and very brief, resurrection scene. That really packs an impressive punch, doesn't it. Sorry for the sarcasm.Now how about the script?  Cut up and horribly contrived. Cool idea to have the Jews and Romans speak in the languages of the time.  But it comes across pretentious and again contrived.Over all the film has no heart.  We as an audience really have no compassion for Jesus as a character in the film aside from the fact that he is being beaten so badly.  We know nothing about Him as the Christ. We are not really let in on His struggles or have any scenes to make us really care about Him as a character.It is also filled with inaccuracies.  But that is not about the film.So I will rest and say that I think it is one of the worst ""A"" list films I have ever seen. Give your money to a charity-not to this Hollywood travesty.Thanks for reading.",The Passion of the Christ
1300,brophyliketrophy,What a bad movie...,1,28 February 2004,"I feel this is one of the worst movies I have seen.  I think people are being affected by this film because of the subject matter....not the film.And I feel there is a growing concern that if you do not like the film, it is somehow anti-christian. How horrible.IT IS ONLY A MOVIE.  It is not a testament of truth anymore than E.T. is a true story.Real faith should not be so fickle as to sway so easily.But the movie itself...silly music,bad cinematography, over used special effects and way too much slow motion.There were moments I had to laugh.  Not at Jesus...at a poor melodrama that winds up mocking Jesus' struggle.My conclusion: Do the really Christian thing- Give your money to charity...don't waste it on this garbage.Thanks for reading.",The Passion of the Christ
1301,lotr_07,Eye Opener,10,3 April 2004,"This movie was a very well made. It went right along with the bible. I would like to thank Mel for having the courage to make this movie. Most people wouldn't want to make such a movie and I am glad that Mel went ahead and made it. He is a great actor and now has shown he is also a great director. Also all the actors, you did a wonderful job protraying the important people. Especially the woman who played Mary, she made me cry many times because she protayed Mary so well that is seemed it was her real son. And, of couse, James Caviezel. He did a spectacular job at being our Lord and savior Jesus Christ. He is truly a gifted actor and I look forward to seeing him in future movies. It is a hard movie to sit though but is truly worth it. It helped me understand better. I would recommend this movie to any one who wants understand the end of Jesus' life better.",The Passion of the Christ
1302,sk1moly,"THE PASSION IS NOT JUST A MOVIE, BUT A TOOL TO BE USED.",10,2 April 2004,"I first must say I am a Southern Baptist Christian.  I say Southern Baptist not as a description or as a moniker to antagonize other religions, but out of pride.  I went to see the Passion of the Christ the second night of it's release.  Partially, I went, out of obligation.  Part of me wanted to see what the big deal was.  I respect Mel Gibson's values that he states and respect the roles and characters that he has taken lately.(i.e., Signs(man of lost faith), What Women Want(learning to be a father again)) I must say that I cried the whole movie.  I left once during the whippings. And numerous times had to stifle from crying in anguish loudly.THE REASON I SAY THIS IS A TOOL IS BECAUSE IT CHANGED MY LIFE. The movie is good but there are many movies better.  What make ""The Passion more than a movie is the subject material and the excessive violence. However, the excessive violence in the movie is exactly what makes the movie great.  My Lord being tortured to death, with each step becoming more and more extreme is what gives me pause. Even if the steps of Jesus torture and execution are not verbatim to the real crucifixion, the viewer is still forced to realize that what he went through was extreme and done out of FEAR.I own a great deal of movies and am definitely a fan of all movies.  What makes THE PASSION different is that I might not watch it again, yet it is the best thing I have ever viewed.  I might not buy it when it is released, yet, I will never forget it.  You see, the TOOL that ""THE PASSION"" is, is that, as a Christian (not as the baptist that I take pride in) I am haunted by this movie.  I find myself thinking of what would I have done back then. I wonder if I could ever love anyone that much to leave my son to that fate. I cry almost every time that I sin thinking that my sin was another mark on my saviors body.  THE PASSION is with me at all times now.  Even a month after viewing the movie I find myself being a better christian, more devoted to my lord god and his son.  I will always have the passion with me now even if I never can watch it again.THE TOOL THAT IS THE PASSION IS THAT IT HAS BECOME A VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CRUCIFIXION.  As a person you may have seen pictures of the crucifixion. You, may see other movies about the crucifixion as well. However, what makes ""THE PASSION"" different is that the excessive gore and the passion of the cast and the crew from the movie makes the images from ""THE PASSION"" impossible to remove from someone's mind.  The gore is the exact thing that gives everyone problems with the movie but is what causes the movie to stay with you.  The incredible suffering and immense pain that My Lord went through will never leave me again.  Horrifying pain that could only be imagined before now has been given an image to go with the words. Forever will I now associate the words of the crucifixion with the images given by Mel Gibson. THANK YOU MEL",The Passion of the Christ
1303,chapachowa03,A GREAT Movie!!!!!!!!!,10,27 February 2004,"I do hope there is a heaven, so I finally can ask to see a life of Christ worthy of its subject.-that quote was taken from someone who commented on this film.  Sorry buddy, but you won't see that life unless you are a believer.And as for some of you saying, ""Oh, Mel Gibson just made this a blood bath."" READ THE BIBLE.  Gibson didn't put anything in the movie that wasn't in the Bible, he didn't make any of it up.  That's the way it happened.The movie was amazing.  I've never seen so many people crying.  I too was one of those people.  This film was amazing and will change lives, like I've seen do all ready.The end of the movie had to get an ""Amen"" when the stone is rolled away and Jesus is RISEN, walking away with only the holes from the nails in his hands.  AMAZING!My favorite movie since I've been 5 has been Star Wars, and now at 19, this has become my favorite film.",The Passion of the Christ
1304,plcarpenter99,Excellent Film,10,25 February 2004,"This film is outstandly done.  This is one of the best flims I have ever seen. Mel has done an amazing job telling this story.He draws you into the story so completely and has a great balance of emotional elements to make you feel that you are experiencing these moments, that make this so outstanding. It is difficult to describe how well this movie is done.  Mel calls this ""lyrical"" and it is that for certain.The scenes with Pilate and the High Preist are very well done also, but at different moments during the movie the words of Jesus tell who is responsible for his death.  It is clear that no man, not Pilate or the High Preist have the power to take his life from him.  How anyone could come away from this film thinking the Jews were responsible for Jesus death, escapes me.The acting is done extremely well.  All of the actors have a focus and devotion in their faces and eyes that tell the story better than any dialogue could ever express.There are some extremely brillant things done with the Judas character and his torment after his betrayal of Jesus and also with Satan and his tempting of Jesus and his presence throughout the film.Mel Gibson has created a masterpiece.  This is an inspirational, emotional and beautiful account of the last hours of Jesus life.  Some parts are not pleasant to watch, but they tell the truth of how horrible death by crucifixtion was.  The Romans were experts at torture and death.  The film was not violent as in terms of other films.  Braveheart was a violent film that was difficult to watch at moments, but the beating and torture of Jesus, while not easy to see doesn't seem as violent as that of Braveheart.The story is one of sacrifice and redemption and Mel Gibson and all who worked on this film have finally brought to the movie screen a realistic view of the death of Jesus.Everyone should see this film!!",The Passion of the Christ
1305,mlblunt_ns,A review,10,28 February 2004,"I'm not a Christian, nor do I belong to any kind of faith. I am not a movie goer who relishes violence or controversy just for the sake of having either. The Passion of The Christ is a movie I really personally liked, it's very moving, very powerful. It's not for everyone though, and the tumult surrounding it seems a bit much to me. It isn't anti-semitic, it is violent (but explain to me how a man being flailed then crucified isn't violent and disturbing), it's also beautiful not solely because of the part of Jesus' life that is represented in the film but because it is a man's labour of love. Mel Gibson's faith and devotion is admirable and I think he's very brave to put something so personal and close to his heart out into the cynical, cruel world we exist in. I have been argued with that Gibson is just glorifying violence, and fear and that The Passion of the Christ is no more then the final scene in Braveheart drawn out for two hours. That why wouldn't Gibson choose to represent the healing power of Jesus' love unless he just enjoyed promoting violence. It seems the answer is obvious that for him personally the sacrifice Jesus made with his life is very important and that's what he is communicating. I don't want to dwell on it, I will just say the violence of the film is upsetting but neccesary. What I felt was completely unnecessary was Satan, the role added nothing to the film and was almost a nuisance. The shadowy creature that leapt out at Judas seemed more appropriate for Gollum to do in the LOTR trilogy. This is my only major complaint with the film. Nothing should have detracted from Jim Caviezel's stunning portrayal of Jesus. Caviezel was absolutely captivating as Pvt. Witt in The Thin Red line and he is as Jesus. Despite previous iffy performances in iffy films, when the man is given a role he can sink his teeth into he is a phenomenal actor. And I don't mean to offend anyone, but his performance is so convincing and touching that I felt I was really watching Jesus. He is just a compelling presence onscreen. And I have to say, does it matter what ethnic origin the actor who portrays Jesus is? As long as he does what all good actors should do which is PLAY THE PART WELL, I don't think it should matter if the actor is white, black, brown, purple or aquamarine. I don't have much exposure to cinema outside of North America (that doesn't mean all I see is from the Hollywood machine) and have no familiarity with the other actors in the film but they were all wonderful, especially Mary, Pontias Pilate, John and Caiphas. I'm not really a cry-er, but the scene where Mary remembers running to Jesus when he stumbled and fell as a small boy as she watches him struggle with carrying his cross made both me and my boyfriend weepy. The film is not flawless, there is some heavy-handedness and shaky direction (Mel isn't the greatest director but his love for his subject matter shines through). It, like many a great movie, is difficult to sit through, there are hard scenes to watch. But I think it is a great shame that so many people are hating this movie without seeing it. If you are a non-religious person you will not walk away from this film feeling like you ought to go to church (or maybe you will I didn't), this film wasn't made to brain-wash the public into becoming devoted Catholics like Gibson. Whether you're a ""believer"" or not it's hard to deny the power of Jesus' sacrifice and that the message of Jesus' life and death is love, and where's the crime in that? I'm glad I saw this film.",The Passion of the Christ
1306,bigmike174,A movie like no others...,10,28 February 2004,"The second the movie was over, I was dumbstruck, and I wasn't the only one. When the movie ended I thought there would be a big round of applause but when I turned around I saw that about half the audience was still in their seats. I looked at a couple of people, some were speachless and most were crying. Nonetheless I didn't hear a word. When I thought about it, i realized an applause would have been ridiculous.When someone asked me how the movie was I was going to say it was amazing, but that wouldn't have done the movie justice. The movie was an extremely moving, emotional experience.The cast was absolutely flawless, Jim Caviezel gave a powerful performance as Jesus, Maia Morgenstern as Mary brought me to tears, and even though Monica Bellucci spoke only a few lines, her performance and beauty astonished me. The score was incredible. It had a middle-eastern feel to it, and was timeless and beautiful.Most aspects of the movie were perfect to me. Instead of a squeaky clean version of the life of Jesus it was a realistic and heartbreaking portrayal of his final hours. The Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew languages, and wonderful cinematography made you really feel like you were in first century Jerusalem. The flashbacks truly had an emotional impact on me.While watching this movie I forgot about everything else in the world. Mel Gibson did an incredible job as a director and he truly was brave for taking on this project despite all the controversy.As for the two main concerns of most people, the ultra-violence, and the alleged anti-semetism these are my views on the two.Everything people are saying about the violence is true. It is brutal, gory, and quite possibly the most violent work in cinematic history. This R-Rating is very well justified and an NC-17 would have made sense. If you are the type of person that cannot bear violence, this is definately not the movie for you. Some scenes of torture last about 10 minutes when you feel you've seen enough after 30 seconds. But, the violence I feel was absolutely necessary. The movie is about the suffering/passion of Jesus, and turning the camera away would not have an impact on you. The movie shows what Jesus actually went through for all of mankind's sins (according to Christianity). Mel Gibson did not exagerate the violence or make it look like horror movie or Kill Bill violence. As Jay Leno said on his show the other night, when Jesus was hit it felt like WE were being hit as opposed to other violent movies were you feel like YOU are the one hitting the person. I don't think anyone can say that every single hit upon Jesus didn't affect him/her somehow.As for the anti-semetism in the movie, I didn't find it was as bad as everyone is making it out to be. The thing that made me see why people were criticizing Mel Gibson for was that instead of spreading the blame somewhat on the Jewish high priests (Sanhedrin) and mostly on Pilate, 99% of the blame was put on the Sanhedrin, which seemed false to me considering that historically it is known that Pilate was a vicious monster, and in the movie he seems like a gentle person and reluctant to crucify Jesus. I simply didn't buy the fact that Pilate would be so nice. The movie can be considered anti-first-century-Romans, and anti-Sanhedrin, but I did not feel the movie was attacking the Jewish religion, or the entire Jewish people. But the movie is not anti-semitic for these reasons: 1. It is made evident that it was Jesus' prophecy and destiny is to die. He could probably have escaped from Gethsemane or even the cross (if he truly had ''powers''). He was born to die, and there is no blame to be placed on anyone. If anything, the Romans of that time are portrayed horribly (though realistically), and they are the ones that made him suffer tremendously before his death. 2. Basically all the ''Good Guys'' in the movie are Jewish. Jesus himself was a Jew, Mary was, The man that helped Jesus carry the cross was Jewish, Veronica the woman that brought Jesus water and wiped his face was, and many Jews were screaming in the crowd against the torture and crucifixion of Jesus. (Personally, I don't know why Pilate was portrayed so nicely. It's not like the Jews had the ultimate power. It was ultimately HIS decision to have Jesus crucified.)An aspect of the film that intrigued me was the character of Satan, and the demons in the movie. When I first found out Satan was in the movie, I was scared it would be a red man with horns and a pitchfork, but he/she is portrayed subtly. Everything about him/her was very Eerie.Mel Gibson deserves a lot of respect for making this film. He made the movie the way HE thought it was and though most historians or even religious figures would not agree completely to what happened, it is a general idea as to what those final hours were. When reading the new testament or hearing the story of Jesus, it's hard to understand what it was actually like for Jesus to go through all that pain, and what it was like for Mary to watch her son get tortured and crucified. The movie really put things in perspective for me.Some people are criticizing him for adding things never written in the gospels such as demons harassing Judas Iscariot, most scenes with Satan, and the torture from Gethsemene to the Jewish court, but he had to fill the blanks in the Gospels with what he thought might have happened.
In conclusion, not everyone will like this movie. Some will love it, and some will hate it. But, I think that if you can endure the extreme violence and torture you should at least see it before you judge it. My opinion: 10/10",The Passion of the Christ

In spite of it brutal violence, this is a film of great beauty and wonder.  Like the Lord of the Ring films, these 12 hours are depicted largely as an epic battle of good against evil. The creepy but also at times strangely attractive Satan character is very interesting.  This film does well in showing Lucifer's true heart and purpose by doing everything he can to destroy the Son of God, and while that is not a pretty thing to watch, one thing becomes clear in this film, evil does not win in the end.  The crowd at my local theater was largely stunned after watching this film and took a good 10 minutes just to get up and leave the theater because it is so powerful.

Mel Gibson in my eyes wrote and directed from his heart, James Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus was top notch, and this movie impressed me all around.

1311,spiderfreak05,"Might as well call this ""Kill Jesus, Vol. 1""...",1,10 February 2005,"Before I saw The Passion, I very interested in it because of all the controversy. Like everyone else, I walked out of the theater in silence, but not because of emotional response or spiritual enlightenment. I was shocked at how incredibly awful it was. Even though I'm a Christian, I was neither moved nor uplifted. Quite the opposite, in fact. I was confused, shocked, and appalled. How any right-thinking adult could bring their kids to see that hyper-violent snuff film is beyond me. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against blood and gore in movies. But when someone uses nonstop violence to send a spiritual message, you know something's wrong. In the two-hour run time, about 97% of the film focused on Jesus being brutally whipped, flogged, bloodied, beaten, eviscerated, and eventually crucified. Despite director Mel Gibson's so-called intentions, there wasn't a HINT of any spiritual overtones or messages. And as in many of his other films, Gibson seems to be so engrossed with his fetish of seeing his characters being subjected to prolonged, slow-motion, gruesome torture, almost to the point of ridiculousness. The film also tries to subliminally guilt-trip us into becoming better believers, using the aforementioned orgy of blood to instruct us on how to believe. And despite many conservative Christians' immediate denials, this film IS anti-Semetic. All the Jewish high priests happened to be caricatures and have the stereotypical hooked noses, and even said, in unsubtitled Hebrew, ""may his blood be on us"", even though Gibson said he'd remove the line entirely after receiving many complaints from Jewish groups. Gibson also whitewashes Roman governor Pontius Pilate into a sympathetic, conflicted man, despite the fact that in the Bible he's described as a heartless, bloodthirsty monster. It's funny how Gibson vilifies the Jews, even the ones who don't heckle Jesus, yet glorifies the Roman man who allowed Jesus to be killed. The film rubs our faces in the grisly and horrendous images of Jesus' ripped-apart body, trying to terrify us rather than uplift us, focusing on how Christ was killed instead of focusing on what Christ taught, which was virtually absent from the movie. If you're a Christian and want to learn about how Jesus died and what he taught, that's what church is for. That'll at least be an alternative that WON'T want to make you vomit. Gibson makes it seem like he's measuring God's love by how much blood is present. Yes, Mr. Gibson, Jesus suffered terribly. Where is that message of love, forgiveness, and tolerance that you insisted on relaying?",The Passion of the Christ
1312,wes321,Extremely moving and Sad,10,28 February 2004,"This movie I recommend for people who think that all the words Jesus has spoken is just ""eh I'll follow it here and there"" is wrong. When you see this movie your perspective of Jesus will change completely. Whenever you go to church you will remember this movie. For this movie you need extreme control over holding back from throwing up. It is soo gory you would not believe it. At one part, the camera ZOOMS in on each of his hands. You actually see the nail go THREW his hands. It's a movie where you have to watch on DVD, so then you can pause, and then resume when you believe your ready for the next gory and sad moment in Jesus's hard life.",The Passion of the Christ
1313,kloessstorm6,religious and artistic excellence,10,25 February 2004,"First of all I am a devout Christian.  At the beginning, there are no credits and they dont present the title.  This movie is unbelievable in the fact that Christians will be awed at the movie.  This is finally a movie that isn't afraid to show the true intensity of the beatings or crucifixion. If people think that Gibson did this just for himself they are wrong.  He didn't even mention the credits or title it at the beginning.  In my opinion, the most powerful scenes in the movie are when Jesus takes the beating with the cat o' nine tails or when the one soldier stabs Jesus in the side to make sure he's dead.  In that scene with the side stabbing, Gibson shows blood pouring out of his side.  Then he pulls the camera out to show a larger scene with the blood pouring out.  If I could sum up this movie with one word it would be WOW!!!  For people that aren't Christians, this movie still would serve as a great movie because it shows the amount of pain that one man went through for others, even if some people don't believe in Christ.  This in my opinion the most powerful movie that I have ever seen because of the great message it delivers that Christ died for everybody's sins.  For some however, they will still get the message whether they believe in him or not.  I wish that everyone would see it; and for the record the movie ISN'T Anti-Semitic.",The Passion of the Christ

Let me just say that this was probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. There are no subtitles, and therefore you can't understand what anyone is saying. And there is no storyline ... the only thing that is shown is the repeated torture of Jesus Christ. That fact that I still don't get what the point of the movie is means that it is not a very well made movie (at least not for non-Christians). As a non-Christian, I don't know too much about the Bible, and so I don't know all the characters that were being shown in the movie and what their significance were. Some sort of explanation should have been provided to help people like me understand the movie better.In short, this is a movie I would definitely tell my friends to NOT watch.

1315,wannas81,Renew your faith...,10,2 March 2004,"Let me just start by saying that I am a muslim and, therefore, do not believe that Jesus was really crucified. Instead it's my belief that it's Judas who ended up on the cross, that Jesus was lifted to the Heavens and that he will, one day, come back to this Earth and save Humanity one more and final time. That said, this movie is simply beautiful... Most people say it's too violent, some even say it's shocking, disturbing, unsettling. I say, again, that it's a beautiful movie. It's about believing in a higher power and being prepared to do anything and risk everything for what one believes. But the scenes that intensely moved me were the heart-wrenching scenes where Gibson brilliantly depicts and Morgenstern inspiredly interprets the suffering and quiet resignation of a mother that is bound to see her cherished loving son having to endure all that pain and torture for his message to be one of love till the very end. To all the people out there who say this is an anti-semitic movie I say two things: * The term anti-semitic is incorrect in the context it is, nowadays, used. All the people in the middle east are Semites and not only those who are jewish. * Stop flashing the ""anti-jew"" sign each time anyone says anything other than ""Jews are angels"". Jewish people are like any other peoples on this Earth; there are good, God-loving, God-fearing Jews, and then there are bad Jews. And yes, Jews did have a hand in all the opposition that Jesus encountered and the constant ordeal that Jesus had to endure for his Faith. But then again, it's OTHER Jews who embraced the new religion as their own and were prepared to pay with their lives for God and His prophet.To me, Jesus is only a prophet, a messenger, a man. But he is so much more than that as well; he is a man with Faith... And this movie is about that...",The Passion of the Christ

Watched is probably the wrong word to use when describing the viewing of this film - a more accurate one could be any of the following: experienced, suffered, endured, stomached, countenanced, bore........you get my meaning.Just saying that The Passion has an emotional impact does not even come near to doing it justice. In fact, whatever I say cannot possibly hope to convey the power that this film exudes. Two hours of unrelenting, gut-wrenching violence and yes, passion, wrung out every last drop of emotion I had. Several times I tried to turn away from the screen and expunge what I was seeing (and hearing), but I just couldn't. I felt compelled to watch every last scene and every flailing whip slicing deep into the Son of God's flesh. If He could go through what He did for the sake of mankind, then I felt that I was obliged to watch what He endured, and experience part of that suffering.In the scene where the Roman soldier signals for His scourging to stop, my relief was unmitigated. Not due to the fact that one of the most lengthy and horrifyingly violent episodes in cinema history was at an end, but that His brutal, and unjustified, suffering was finally at an end. When the same soldier indicated that He should be turned over, and the punishment continued unabated, my almost overpowering emotions of disbelief and anguish were something that I have never before encountered watching a film.This is just one example of how the entire film's power drew me in and convinced me that I was witnessing, first hand, the appalling events that were taking place. At the conclusion, I just sat there, silent and stunned at what I had experienced and the emotions it had aroused. I am not a religious person, but the incidents portrayed have opened my eyes to the events, sentiments and passion on which Christian belief is based.",The Passion of the Christ

The copy we saw was not the final cut of the movie, but was 95% percent finished... but even so, it was quite a powerful and awe-inspiring experience! The film is as brutal as it is extraordinary. As a Catholic, I could not help but be inspired/horrified by the images of Christ's suffering, and I was moved to tears countless times. It is artistically impressive and the acting is perfect. It is like you are there. Indeed, as someone said : ""It is as it was"" !""We esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed."" (Isaiah 53: 4b-5, RSV).(As for the controversy, I didn't find the film Anti-Semitic--- unless you consider the Gospels anti-semitic!--- ; on the contrary, there are so many good, compassionate Jews surrounding Christ with their love and support!

Though alot of the torture scenes were very graphic and brutal they literally made my stomach turn,that's realism! not to mention the fact that it actually looked ""real"" not bubble gum b-movie special effects.  Mel Gibson took a huge risk with this movie, and he did a fine job whatever the critics may say, and for those who chide him for making money from it.  You have to put money in first to make any money out of a movie in the first place dummies! that's why movies are made to make the investors money back and maybe more if it's a success like this movie duh!

1322,Xcaughta,One of the most moving pictures I have ever seen.,9,23 February 2004,"Wow. I just got back from my local cinema's screening for ""The Passion of the Christ"" and I am a loss of words. I am a huge movie buff and have watched more than my share of films, but this one sticks out. Never before have I been moved by a picture in this way.I am a proud atheist, and went into the movie expecting to watch a religious movie. It is not a movie based on religion, however. It's just a good story filmed in the best way it could be.I don't see what all of the fuss is about with the current strife that this movie is causing between the Jews and Christians. It won't cause anti-semitism. It isn't intended to cause anti-semitism. Give it up!The one factor about this movie that I can see controversy brewing of is how graphic it is. Again, I have seen movies that push the goryness to a point of unrealisticness, and have walked out fine. I consider myself a very tough movie watcher; one who can handle anything on the screen. Let me tell you: there were parts in this movie that made me cringe in my seat. It hurt me to watch the suffering that was taking place on the screen. It was extremely graphic, yet it still held on to the point of looking real, and THAT is why it has so much of an effect.I walked out of the movie not sad, because I knew (as everyone should know) the basic story of what happens. There is no ""surprise"" ending, and you shouldn't expect there to be one. Now, though I wasn't sad, I WAS dumbstruck. I sat through the credits while the cleaning lights came on saying nothing. I couldn't move of speak. All I could say when I came out of the theater was ""wow."" It touched me in a way that no other movie has touched me.Though it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, it was the most moving. For this, I give it a 9.0.P.S. - Let's see what's gonna happen on Wednesday.",The Passion of the Christ
1323,jrayes42,An Agnostic view,8,26 March 2004,"Before I begin let me explain that I am not christian. I was at one stage, but lets just say god and I have issues, and leave it at that. I feel this is important due to the debate about this film, and I want my review to be taken as it is intended. Weather or not you are christian, history records that Jesus did actually exist, its recorded in historical records by those who have no stake in saying he did. What is in debate is weather or not he was the son of god. That said, Athiest, pagan or undecided, this is a powerful film.The last hours of Jesus are well documented in the bible and I cant understand all the fuss that this film has caused with its violence. Hell, his last hours were violent...er..for christs sake. What people forget, especially many who have read the relevant texts so many times, is just how violent it was. Its easy to become blaise. This movie grabs you by the scruff of the neck, drags you kicking and screaming into the fray, and says ""Watch"".The scourging made me want to turn away, but I watched anyway, remembering the account. It wasnt the only scene that made me want to look away, and I honestly had tears in my eyes more than once. I found this to be a really powerful film, and I think that Mel Gibson was pretty brave in taking such a full on stance. I think perhaps it went a little too long, but then, with so much suffering portrayed who wants it to drag out?I left the Cinema saying ""Jeeeesssuuuss"". Im not heading back to church anytime soon, but it made me see the gospel in a fresh light. As for the anti semitism, well, the film did no more than relate the way that the bible says the jews treated Jesus. Im not going to judge. I wasnt anti sematic before I went in and Im still not. It was just a movie that told the story of the last hours of Jesus according to the gospels. And it did it well. Im still not a christian and its going to take more than a well done film to make me so (Armageddon anyone?).

1326,Silentdreamer580,Speechless,10,3 March 2004,"I saw this movie two days ago and it is still on my mind. I remember how speechless everyone was when they came out of the movie theater. Someone who works at the theater told me to have a good afternoon, and I didn't even respond. I was so impacted that I didn't know what to say.I've seen countless reviews on this film, from critics to moviegoers. From what I see there is really no in between with the film. Either you love it or you hate it. Personally, I love this movie and for me it ranks up there with some of my all time favirotes like The Godfater, Seven Samurai, and Forest Gump.What I can't believe is the amount of backlash this movie has received. People are saying that it is ultraviolent. I'll agree that this is a film no kid under 14 should watch, but I don't think its violence doesn't serve its purpose. Its not violent for the sake of being violent. What Mel Gibson has done is make a perfect translation of Christ's death according to the scriptures. I have read the four gospels in the past and there is nothing in the film that isn't in the bible. People point to the countless beating and suffering, but that's exactly what Christ went through. I see this as one man taking a literary work and translating it to a great movie. Just like Peter Jackson did for Lord of the Rings.I commend Mel Gibson for staying honest to the material presented in the four gospels. People are saying that this is violent and anti-semetic, please read the gospels first before you make those claims. That way you can see that Mel Gibson didn't just put certain imagery there for no apparent reason. For instance, SPOILER- There is a certain scene in the end thats pretty hard to watch, it was hard for even me to watch. Its the scene when the Roman soldier stabs Jesus just to check if he is already dead and all of Jesus' blood spurts out. After viewing this movie, I went to the gospels the next day and I saw that in the book of John this actually took place. Another thing I notice is how people are claiming that they wanted to see more of Jesus' teachings, well thats what the other Jesus movies are for. If you want to see that go rent Jesus of Nazereth. Every other movie has focused on his teachings this is the first one I've ever seen that focuses on his death.So in closing, all I want to say is that people should come to this movie with an open mind, don't let some issues get in the way or else your just going to find it negative. I give kudos to Mel for making such a wonderful and accurate portrayel of Christ's death. 10 out of 10",The Passion of the Christ

Mr. Mel Gibson and his team have done a work of art! It's a must be seen movie! It will touch thousands of lives in the years to come. People will think more seriously about their destiny. The movie makes people (including myself) realize THE GREAT PRICE GOD has paid to save the mankind (my soul). It shows how big is God's love for us and how ugly is our sinful nature! I pray that thousands and thousands of lives will be moved and consider God's message to all mankind! The Creator became human in the person of Jesus Christ to show us the Way to heaven. Jesus says: ""I Am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.""

1328,waldrcar,It is as it was.,10,25 February 2004,"Pope John Paul II's comment after viewing the Passion of Christ was, ""It is as it was.""  This is the only way I can think of to describe this amazing movie.  It is not an easy movie for anyone to watch, due to the reality of the brutality of Christ's passion and crucifixion.  This suffering of the Son of God is hard for us to accept, especially knowing that he endured such suffering in order to offer us forgiveness for our sins.  The movie is more than suffering though, throughout the movie I could see Christ's love for all souls, giving hope to sinners.  Mel Gibson knows that this is what our society needs to see.  Such divine love represented in Christ's passion can and will change many hearts this Lenten season.  Praised be God for the release of this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
1329,spacewit,What you get out depends on what you bring in.,10,8 March 2004,"I think that a viewer's reaction to this movie will depend on the sentiments they arrive at the theater with. If the statement ""Jesus Christ died for your sins"" fills you with guilt and sorrow, you'll feel guilt and sorrow. If it fills you with joy, you'll feel a weird sort of joy. If it fills you with bemused contempt for anyone who could believe such claptrap, this movie will fill you with bemused contempt. And so on.And, if you worry about the Christians persecuting the Jews, there is material in this movie to make you worry about anti-Semitism. Since 90% of the people depicted are Jewish, some of the bad guys (and all of the good guys) are Jewish. Some of the Pharisees are depicted as trying to stop the midnight trial, which puts the lie to the statement I've seen that all the Pharisaical Jews are portrayed as horrible people. I think the anti-Semitic rhetoric says more about the offended reviewer and their sentiments about Christianity than it does about Mel Gibson's intents.As a movie: Should win the Oscar for costuming. Not only should it win the Oscar for makeup, they ought to retire it and hereafter award the ""almost as good as 'The Passion of the Christ' Academy Award"" for makeup. Not just Jesus, but the subtle decadence of Satan, the flamboyant decadence of Herod, the bloodstained Mary, and so on. Cinematography and acting are both superb - although I felt that the Apostle John didn't live up to the rest of the cast in this regard. He seemed sort of weak and lost.One scene that should have found the cutting room floor - the big black bird pecking at the 'bad' thief. Unbiblical and unnecessary.",The Passion of the Christ
1330,cchiampa,So bad it borders on comical.,3,25 February 2004,"I'm not exactly positive what to say. The only reason I gave this a 3 as opposed to a 1 is because it had some moments that were actually funny, though not intentionally so. This was little more than a high-budget version of some awful passion film I would have been forced to watch in Sunday school as a child around Easter time. I know there's only so many ways to tell the story of the life of Christ, but this method has been used far too often. I suppose there was some originality in that it was, indeed, the most anti-Semitic version of the passion I've ever seen. As a friend of mine commented: ""Every time something bad happened, there was a Jew in the foreground enjoying it."" I'd like to think Mel Gibson was not intentionally making a such a racist film, but whether he meant it or not it was there. Outisde of that, the dialogue was also fairly bad. It was like filler between the gore. Now, gore does not shock or horrify me. Like so many young people these days, I'm horribly de-sensitized. So the ""violence"" and ""gore"" were not very shocking. Run-of-the-mill fare for people my age. But after a while, it was just redundant. The audience begins to feel pain, themselves: the pain of utter and complete boredom. The only highlights were some of the moments of unintended comedy, which I shall not reveal here. Just let me tell you to keep an eye on Judas. Despite it being an utter failure of a film, I have no regrets about seeing 'Passion.' I could not pass up the chance to see one of the most talked-about and controversial films to come along in ages. It was a completely bizarre experience. If you've no qualms about dropping the cash, I'd say it's worth the price of admission just to see the utter insanity that is 'The Passion of the Christ.'",The Passion of the Christ
1331,Rep4Truth,The most POSITIVE influence of any film,10,2 March 2004,"Mel's passion, Christ's pathos, will be remembered as the most positive film of this or any other generation. No other film will be able to show, in such great detail, the pain, suffering and ultimate joy of Jesus Christ, Mary, and those who were around them at the time of Christ's death and resurrection. Mel Gibson pain-stakingly (pun intended) depicts the horror that is scourging and crucifixion.Anyone who has taken even a quick glance through the four Gospels of the Bible knows that Christ was tortured and then crucified. But until you see it the way that Mel has filmed it (and Jim and Mia act/react) you cannot begin to understand what Christ chose to go through on mankind's behalf.Is this probably the most important religious film in history? Yes. Is this one of the best lighted, shot, and acted film in recent time? Quite possibly yes. This may well be the standard by which all future religious films will be judged.

Great soundtrack, great visuals, great hooks.Mel Gibson knows how to make a movie, and the cast performed flawlessly.But to walk in to see a movie alone, would fall short of the goals for this film.Historically speaking, it is probably more accurate than other movies we have seen such as Private Ryan or Elizabeth or JFK or Chariots of Fire. The thing to remember with all historical movies is that the writers and directors always take liberties with the hard facts they have to craft the film.  Is this wrong?  I don't think so.Emotionally speaking, if you want emotion you can have it, if you try to fight it or just be critical, it is able to be avoided, but not so much if you are actually watching the story.The suspension of disbelief is as easy as in any other good film.The plot could be somewhat confusing if you are unfamiliar with the story. There are several instances of symbolism that you could get lost in. Anyone with a typical upbringing should be able to follow it.Anti-Semitist it is not, unless you want to say it is also pro-Semitist in regards to those who did not want him murdered.Anti-Italian would be more accurate, if you look at the way the film was crafted.  The Jews felt they were doing right by God.  The Roman guards were the cruel ones.  However, i don't know any Italians screaming that this is a hate film towards them.The experience could change you.  Never before has this story been told this way.

The violence was a bit strong for my liking, but I understand why Gibson felt the need to put it in there, and I won't ever condemn him for it.

It is very violent, which is something that I generally wouldn't enjoy, but it is an understandable violence.  You have to remember while watching this that the film isn't about a religion or persecution or anti-Semitism, or whatever you want to call it.  This movie is about the suffering that one man, whether you believe him to be the son of God or not, endured for the cause of saving all of us.  It doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Muslim or Hindu or whatever else you might be, the film is about peace and acceptance. Jesus taught of peace, that is what fills the pages of the Bible.  I recommend this film to anyone, not just Christians, as I would want to see a film that tells a major story of any religion.  This movie was not designed to provoke controversy, but show a story from the bestselling book of all time (the Bible).  If you don't believe it, that doesn't mean it should offend you, and it doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it.  Seeing this movie would help you to understand Christians, not to be one of us, but to understand the religion.  I think the most important step to acceptance is understanding, and the beauty of this film, hidden beneath the violence, is the understanding of why Jesus is believed to be a Savior.  His suffering is clear, and I applaud the actor, I believe he deserves a lot of recognition for this.  I also applaud Mel Gibson for having the guts to portray this story, even knowing what the masses would accuse him of.  He's been called a racist for telling a story of suffering (which by the way is the original meaning of passion, especially in reference to Christ).  This movie is not for those with weak stomachs, or those looking for the controversy, but if you just want to see a good film that references one of the most well known stories in existence, then you should see the Passion.One more note on the subject of subtitles.  I am generally the type of person, who refuses to see a movie merely on the basis of subtitles, but this film is far more moving just because it's in those languages.  The subtitles are done well, and leave you with plenty of time to read, so it's not hard to tell what's happening.  I tried, but did not succeed, to watch the movie for its symbols, and ignore the subtitles.  In some scenes I was able to do this, but I think the subtitles may have been necessary, even though I was originally opposed to them, in that they allow you to see Pilot as a monster, and they make it obvious that the Jews were not blamed for the suffering of Christ.  Gibson does not blame this on the Jewish people, regardless of what you may hear on television, but rather on the Romans and on the one particular religious leader.Okay, so the point of this rather incoherent discussion of the Passion of the Christ, and the controversy surrounding it, is that the film is an amazing piece of work that brings meaning to our movie screens and our lives.  I would recommend it to all my friends and family.",The Passion of the Christ
1336,penni_rose,Continuation of my review,10,25 February 2004,"After having read some of these reviews, I have begun to feel entirely sick by the amount of people in this world, who are misinterpreting this film.  I will not go to far into this, but I want to ensure that I re-emphasize the importance of SUFFERING in this film.  I'm not a very ""good"" Christian.  I haven't been to church in over a year, but that is not the point, I just thought it should be said so that you wouldn't think I was trying to convert you, I'm not.  The film wasn't designed for personal gain or egotism or just plain violence, this is a movie about pain.  It's what the Son of God, or prophet or just person if you don't believe, went through, suffered through because the world was too close-minded to accept his teachings.  The sad thing is, though, in 2000 years, it hasn't changed at all. People are calling this movie ""evil"", ""un-Christian"" and ""anti-Semitic"" because they are too caught up in themselves and their own beliefs to accept someone else's ideas.  If you really watch the movie, you don't see a bad image of the Jews or anti-Christian symbols, you see the pain of a man, an innocent man, sentenced to die by a monster who believed he committed no crime.  Pilate and the Romans are the characters that should be hated and blamed, I saw no reason to believe that the Jews caused the crucifixion, and I don't know how anyone else did. I wouldn't call a Jewish film anti-Christian, and if it was as well made as this movie, I would commend the effort, so I see absolutely nothing wrong with someone expressing his beliefs.  This is a free country that we live in, and we have no right to judge each other like that.I just want to make one more comment:  I saw on the news people flaming Mel Gibson as a person, not a director or screenwriter.  This is wrong.  Mel is a stand-up guy, who believes in expressing himself.  If you want to insult the movie, do so, but make sure to leave Mel and his family out of this.",The Passion of the Christ
1337,efenster-2,This picture did what it was intended to do.,10,1 March 2004,"A lot of critics I have heard disliked or even dismissed this movie.  They seemed to think that the movie should have focused on Christ's ministry and his teachings, and not on the crucifixion and the events leading up to it. These critics miss the point of this movie.  As with all movies, The Passion was directed at a target audience, in this case Christians.  The point of the movie was simply this: to make Christians understand, in a visceral way, what they knew intellectually from reading the bible: that Christ endured a horrible and brutal death in order to save us from our sins.  It was completely successful in this, and was, perhaps, the most powerful movie I have ever seen.",The Passion of the Christ
1338,surfdudedave,It is as it was,9,26 February 2004,"First let me say that this movie is an amazing visual piece. No Christian film as ever displayed Jesus and his final 12 hours like this before, and that's what makes this an awe-inspiring film.  I went to see this movie for many reasons, and I was very grateful for getting the chance to see this film.  People have said this is a violent film and that Mel Gibson has exaggerated the events. I beg to differ.  A violent film is Braveheart or a Robocop or Terminator...even a Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This film shows what happened to one man. You may not believe in this, but this is what Gibson has shown and made.  I felt convicted and better yet found myself a part of this experience.  Mel Gibson places you in the story. You see the story through the eyes of every character involved.  The hatred that the Jewish leaders have for Jesus, the callousness of the Roman guards, the pain of what Jesus' mother Mary sees as her son is beaten, and most importantly, you see the love, power, and humanity of Jesus.  This film is beautifully crafted and the set pieces are amazing.  People have said that its not in english and the sub-titles are hard to read...Grow up. We are all adults. We can read a few lines here and there. Much of the movie relies on the expressions and actions of the characters, not the words they say.  Their aren't alot of subtitles and hearing the original language makes it that more personal, like you are there.  It does not detract from the movie at all. If you're curious about the film see it and judge for yourself. if you think its anti-semetic, its not. We are all grown ups here and can understand that this is a movie. I was more angered by the guards treatment rather than what the Jews did. They focus on individuals, not a group as a whole. If your upset about violence, remember that this is what the Bible teaches about what Jesus went through. It is not a watered down version. All in all, like the Pope said, it is as it was. Truly a work of art that shouldn't be missed.",The Passion of the Christ
1339,jmfmaker,Dissatisfaction,8,2 March 2004,"This movie is, first of all a piece for which I have a tremendous respect for.  But, I have to admit that coming out of the theater I didn't feel good about the film.  Having expected too much from it, it displeased me.  The first thing this film misses out on is the ability to move you.  You would think that you would get more emotional for the characters but you don't. The actors, probably not powerful enough to handle such a movie is probably the cause.  The other thing which shouldn't have been done is using subtitles.  Mel Gibson should have sticked to his idea of not using any subtitles and let the performances speak for themselves.  Subtitles make you miss the performances.  Something happened while I was watching the movie. I felt some kind of indescribable discomfort but there was no violence happening on the screen.  Maybe it was too warm in the theater...  See this movie without expecting too much from it and you will probably do just fine. Unlike me, who is right now asking God to explain to me why this movie wasn't able to move me.",The Passion of the Christ
1340,marceloalvarez,great,10,26 February 2004,"yesterday I saw the movie and ,im not a religious person,I was moved inside until now i feel this way,the film is an excellent artistic interpretation of the events,and the feeling that it causes is very deep,for people like me who was grown in a religious home and know some of the facts. i've read a lot of reviews and i'm not agree with most of them,in the fact that this film looses the espiritual content,and exaggerates in the visual violence. I think and I saw in the theater that the movie changed the people who was there from he beginning when they were even making fun of Christ ,so the purpose is intact,by causing an effect that stays in the chest like pain. the score is other excellent point in the movie,it brings you in it. for me it was very strong in its purpose ,and it got it. 9/10",The Passion of the Christ
1341,funnygirl65,The Truth Hurts,10,28 February 2004,"I've gone to church my whole life and what Mel Gibson did in under 2 hours is more than any minister I've ever heard preach.  This morning in a packed theater I was an eyewitness to the crucifixion of my Lord.  It is definitely an ""experience"" and not just a movie.  I was fearful in anticpation of seeing the graphic, bloody scenes (and they are plentiful) but watching the blood flow caused me not to be revulsed but to be humbled, saddened but profoundly thankful.  I felt the full force of Jesus' mercy and love during the flashbacks while he was being tortured.  Those who come away from this movie seeing it filled with hate, malice, and persecution need to look inward because there is nothing on that screen that should cause anyone to rise up against anyone else.  And those who dispute the validity of the text need to look no further than the four gospels.  It's the truth and it hurts.  I physically ache after seeing this.  And as my pastor said today after the film, this will take days to process fully.",The Passion of the Christ
1342,studleywankenobi,The most amazing movie ever!,10,24 March 2004,"The single most wonderous, moving, thought provoking movie I have ever seen. Makes every other movie I've ever seen pale in comparison. Mel Gibson portrayed the book of John as accurately as could be expected. There was not a dry eye in the theater. I am still processing all that I took in. I took my two oldest children 18 and 15 to see it and watched with amazement when it sunk in and they were moved by the sacrifice of Christ for all of our sins.I don't see any anti-semitic message in the movie at all. The acting was so good, you didn't notice it was acting.I recommend this to all.",The Passion of the Christ
1343,alexanderleslie,"Visually Stunning, Emotionally Evocative",10,26 February 2004,"""The Passion of The Christ"" is a true work of art.  Focused almost entirely on the crucifixion and death of Christ, it views like a continuing conversation that was started sometime, somewhere before and which will now fill in the details.  There are no broad, detailed explanations as  to the ostensible mission of the man;  no extensive background on the prisoner whose impending death looms before us.  The historical Christ--of whom almost no one can claim complete ignorance--looms before us, and then gets down to the business of dying before our eyes. But why? If, as some claim, there can be no intellectual or emotional resonance with this story for anyone other than a believer, why bother? Because it is art, as true and as rich as has ever stirred a heart. Because the emotional themes in this firm correlate with the central issues of humanity: the primal and irresistible impulse of a mother (Mary) to protect her child from unconscionable pain; the gut-wrenching and seductive temptation of a man (Jesus) to shirk the duty that he knows he was called to; the endlessly deep gratitude of a woman (Mary Magdalene) who was literally lifted from the abyss by love; and the disturbing echoes of a traitor (Judas) who betrayed his closest friend for profit, and had to take his own life to still the screams of conscience. Religious and non-religious alike can take from these snapshots of the human experience a deeper appreciation of the complexities of human existence, the eternal rippling effect of once-perpetuated injustice, and the radical notion that pain can be transformed into something noble, something beautiful.  Like all great art, the images in the film seep into the intellect and shoot into the soul and than burst raging into the heart.See this film as a believer.  Or see it as a skeptic.  But see it. And then walk away in solidarity with the rest of the human race.",The Passion of the Christ
1344,alexanderleslie,A Catholic Christian Speaks to the Emphasis on Suffering in the Film,10,1 March 2004,"Many writers have questioned the heavy emphasis on Christ's suffering in the film and the de-concentration on His resurrection.  Mr. Gibson's intention, as he has explained it, was to vividly illustrate that ""By his stripes we are healed.""  The word ""passion"" means ""to suffer,"" and it was in this voluntary suffering and act of sacrificial atonement that the Son reconciled us to the Father.  Through the gift of his broken body, we are saved.Why the concentration on the brutality?  Because if we aren't reminded of it, we will forget it.  And what kind of thanks would that be?  For reconciliation to be achieved, we needed a sacrifice as broad, as deep, as all-giving, as extreme as the rebellious disobedience of Adam and Eve that separated us from God.  The burden of the entire world's sin, cruelty and evil was on the son--all sin that had ever been committed or would ever be committed had to be atoned for and this required the most complete offering possible;  it necessarily included the horrendous physical, psychological and emotional suffering of Jesus.  The Passion, Christ's free and voluntary gift of himself, was brutal.  But in Christ's offering of himself for the world and for each of us individually, we are made whole.So the concentration on the passion or suffering--on the selfless gift offered by our savior--was the POINT of the film.  Gibson, of course, does include a beautiful and hopeful resurrection scene in which a contemplative Lord peacefully gazes forward, aware that he has accomplished his mission. But again, the point of the film was the PAIN--and the joy, light and vindication that followed.It is a mistake for a Christian to avert the gaze from the suffering Christ, to seek only the empty cross, as it selfishly avoids the Way of the Cross that made the Resurrection possible.  If it makes one uncomfortable to recall the Passion, how do we think our Lord felt, abandoned and alone?  The Crucifixion and the Resurrection cannot be separated; that is why Catholics thank our Lord in prayer often, particularly when we are reminded of His suffering by a representation of his broken body on a crucifix.  And that is why Catholics and other Christians rejoice on Easter morning to remember and mystically relive his joyful resurrection.  Thank you, Lord!As Catholics begin Lent and prepare for the Easter season, we make what we call the ""Way of the Cross"" on Fridays in Lent, remembering and walking with our Lord on his painful journey, thanking him as we say,""We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you, because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world!""",The Passion of the Christ
1345,ranten-n-raven,This film is NOT anti-Semetic and will change lives,10,24 February 2004,"This is a decidedly Christian movie.  And fair warning: this is a Christian's review. If you are a Christian, go see it.  It will awaken your understanding of and appreciation for God's greatest gift. If you are not a Christian, go see it.  It will show you what God suffered for us, to bring us back to Him.Either way:  It should change your life.  From now on, Church, old songs like ""The Old Rugged Cross,"" and especially communion will never be the same again.The BIG question: Will this cause a flood of anti-Semitism?  No, not even! We have close Jewish friends, so I watched carefully for signs of ""Blame the Jews!""  (SPOILER WARNING) Here's what stood out to me:1. During the arrest, Jesus heals the ear of the soldier.  Gibson doesn't seem to have Jesus blame that Jew.2. The Jewish guards roughed Him up, yes.  But that was nothing compared to the later joy-in-brutality of the Romans.3. During the trial, there are two high-ranking Jewish defenders of Jesus. But, the rich and powerful have stacked the deck and they are kicked out. Gibson can hardly be said to blame those two Jews.4. As Jesus is flogged, some Jews in the crowd wince in sympathy. Gibson doesn't seem to blame His death on them.5. As Jesus drags the cross through the streets, the crowds of common Jews are shown crying. Gibson doesn't seem to blame His death on them, either.6. As Jesus drags the cross through the streets, the crowds of common Jews throw stones at the Romans. Gibson sure doesn't seem to blame His death on them.7. At one point, as Jesus lies in the street, and the Romans are whipping the crowd back, one poor Jewish woman braves the whips to go to Jesus. She uses her clothing to wipe the blood and grime from his face, then offers Him a drink.  Are we to think Gibson is blaming her?8. As Jesus is dying on the cross, even the Jewish criminal on the cross to His left notes to the Chief Rabbi that ""He is praying for you!""  Gibson shows Jesus praying for the forgiveness of those who are killing Him, Roman and Jew, alike.  If Gibson trying to raise the rabble against the Jews, why show God Himself praying for the forgiveness of all?Those who have painted this as something that will spark anti-Semitism owe Mel Gibson an apology.  And we all owe Mel our thanks for his labor of love.And now my eyes are wet again.  Go see it--and bring tissues!Robin Juhl",The Passion of the Christ
1346,rio1morales,Now I understand why I will forever worship Jesus as my King.,10,25 February 2004,"I thought this movie was fantastic.  I noticed that during the film I found myself crying not at the times when Jesus was being beaten but when he was showing compassion and mercy  to people.  I do not in any way believe that this film is anti-semetic, but I do believe that at least one truth should be addressed here.  It was the Jewish people who were calling for the death of Jesus and they chose not to accept him as the Messiah.  However I truly believe that it was darkness that is to blame for their misdirection. They chose not to accept them as the Messiah and to be honest if I lived in those times I can't say 100% for sure that I would have made the right decision. I feel badly for anyone who leaves this movie and feels hatred or anger. My hope is that people will leave this film seeking God and finding a relationship in Jesus with him as their Savior and Lord.  I'm not perfect and will never claim to be but I will say this, I left this movie realizing that darkness has no power over my life.  I make choices that are either good or bad.  It's as simple as that and if anything happens in my life it is pre-ordained by God in regards to the decisions that I've made.Thank you Mel Gibson for making this film and thank you Jesus from the bottom of my heart for enduring what you went through for me.  Tomorrow is promised to no one boys and girls, it's time to figure out what you believe in and what path you are going to choose.  May God bless you and your way.",The Passion of the Christ
1347,Zhanger,Beyond Powerful,10,25 February 2004,"The Passion of the Christ is the most powerful movie I have seen in my life. No review or discussion can fully prepare you for the wrenching violence encountered in this film.  Other film and television depictions of Jesus tend to focus on his message and the way he lived.  This movie focuses completely on his death, with brief flashback scenes that convey his message of forgiveness, which I interpret as concise attempts to dispense any human animosity felt while viewing the violence.The film is absolutely brutal, and would make almost anyone who is desensitized to violence become uneasy.  For this is not a film where violence is spread out among many, not signified with quick death by bullets, or torture scenes depicted in other movies that may last for a few minutes.  It is unrelenting prolonged violence concentrated on one man, pushing you beyond a cliff of disgust and drawing your every last sympathy. Gibson takes no sympathy on the viewer's capacity to witness such barbaric acts and the resulting state of one man's body.  He pushes our revulsion to the limit, leaving nothing up to the imagination.  Every sound of pain is heard with an image of what is causing it, and once the acts are underway they are repeatedly hammered into you without cutaways.I do not believe this film is outright anti-Semitic.  Roman soldiers are the ones who are shown committing the brutal acts and actually taking a sick joy from it.  Pontius Pilate is represented as being sympathetic towards Jesus, a governor who simply gives in to a bloodthirsty crowd.  And yet he is the one who indeed accepts the crucification and has his own men carry out the deed.  The film also portrays division within the rabbi council who try Jesus, with a few of the rabbis coming to the defense of Jesus.  So I simply do not see the direction of this movie pointing a finger on Jewish people as a whole.  It shows sympathy from some Jews and some Romans, and places the responsibility for his death on the shoulders of some Jews and some Romans.After seeing this film, I do not believe I can see it again.  Seeing it once is enough to contemplate its meaning; it is powerful enough that I do not need to be reminded about what it seeks to convey.  The movie leaves you wanting more answers, and has reawakened my interest in reading for myself the message of Christ.",The Passion of the Christ
1348,movieviewer,Is this what religion is?,1,25 February 2004,"What's the point here?  Is this what real religion teaches?  It's funny, but I tend to focus more on the inspirational nature of Christ and his message of love and forgiveness, yet this movie focuses only on pain and death. Far from being a moving experience, I only found this film to be disgusting. In essence, this film subverts what Christ came to teach, rather than affirming it. Well, aside from that, the acting was very well done and there were many technical areas of the film which should be applauded.  Too bad they were ultimately wasted on a film which should have been rated NC-17 due to its pornographically violent nature. To be honest, I personally feel there's more to learn from a movie like Finding Nemo than there ever is in this sort of over-the-top blood-letting spectacle.",The Passion of the Christ
1349,ladyhook27,I saw it tonight...,10,25 February 2004,"Although brutally bloody, this was also a beautiful movie. I believe that it depicts the torture and crucifixion of Jesus the way that it happened. The scenes between Jesus and Mary were heartbreaking and full of love. And as far as the concern over it being against the jewish people, I don't think that it was anti-semitic at all. If anything, I felt that the roman soldiers who carried out Jesus' sentence were the ones pictured in the worst light.Thank you Mel Gibson, for your faith and courage in making ""The Passion"".

The film's intimation that the Jews were directly responsible for the gruesome death of Christ is...well...less than subtle.  Osama bin Laden and Yasser Arafat would love this movie, and Mel Gibson should be ashamed of himself for having the chutzpah to push his virulent anti-Semitism on moviegoers worldwide.

It definitely makes you weigh you worries and show you that things could probably be much worse.  Also, if you are a Christian it reinforces how much he really suffered for us.  It's much more than the Easter morning skit that your church puts on.  It also gives you hope.  If you have a 12 year-old child, don't hesitate to let them see it, despite the rating.

So where do you think you are going to go when you die?  Or do you believe in reincarnation?  If so, then wouldn't things that you have done in this world reflect on what you will become in your next life???  I don't know about you but I know that I am not with out sin or let's say doing anything that's not right.  As a matter of fact I don't think that there is anyone in this world that hasn't done something that they shouldn't have.  What do you think you deserve?  It surprises me everyday to see how people can just over look God. I work in a hospital and I have seen some people that shouldn't have made it out alive due to their conditions.  And I know that it is the Lord that allows us to have people as gifted as our doctors that can help heal our bodies.  It is the Lord that gives us the strength to make it through our worst and best times.  It is He that teaches us our most valuable lessons in life, and most certainly in death.  He is a righteous and loving God, and He gives us the choice to receive him as our Savior.

I predict this will become the top-grossing movie of all time before it leaves the big screens and is released on video. Many of us have read the Bible, read the story of the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus. However, even when it is described how much suffering Jesus endured as He was put to death, it never gives you a true feeling for just how much suffering He endured. While it is a movie with actors and special effects, you can't help but cringe and feel some anxiety knowing that this is what happened to Jesus. It will give all a greater understanding and appreciation of what Christ endured, and will make you think twice about sinning again.",The Passion of the Christ
1355,Derekwhite9999,"Good, but Gory",9,29 February 2004,"I don't know what I was expecting out of this movie.  As a Christian, I know the story of Christ's crucifixion.  It seemed strange, though, to see the brutality of it all up on the big-screen theater.  Although I would rather he remained strictly faithful to the crucifixion accounts in the Gospels, I think Mel Gibson did an outstanding job of portraying this magnificent event, and the love of Christ demonstrated through it.  It also, I believe, accurately portrayed sinful man (not just Jews or Romans, but ALL OF US) actually enjoying making him suffer.  Although non-Christians may not understand or believe it, God the Father allowed his Son to suffer the punishment we should have suffered because of our sinfulness.  When we minimize that sacrifice, we, in essence, have a smile on our face, just like those who whipped Jesus did.On another note, I would recommend that ALL adults review this movie BEFORE you take your kids (anyone under 17).  Understand it yourself.  Then, hopefully, if you decide to take your kids, you will be better prepared to explain everything to your kids.  For those with weak stomachs, I would highly recommend watching the Pax TV special ""The Making of 'The Passion'"" beforehand, too.  They explain a little bit of how the special effects were done.Although this is probably NOT the BEST movie I've ever seen, it IS the BEST movie about Jesus' life that I've ever seen.

In Isaiah 53 it says you couldn't even recognize him ...Anti-semitic? Hardly! Jesus was a Jew. His disciples were Jews. Many, many Jews followed and believed in him. A few Jewish leaders sought his death because He upset the status quo and their power.But it was all according to plan.This movie is a fresh re-interpretation of this age-old story with strong ties to the gospel account.

This movie focuses mostly on the last 12 hours of Jesus life and yes it is hard to watch in some moments but that is reality.  That is what Jesus did for every single one of us.  I commend Mel Gibson.  He did and excellent job.  Jim Caviezel was amazing to watch he really made you feel, emotionally , Jesus pain. It is intense and painful to watch but sometimes that is what we need to realize how much He suffered for us. This movie opened my eyes and reminded me of God's love.

I have always been a Christian, but this movie gave me more than a glimpse of just how much Christ suffered for us. So I told myself I better get back on track pronto & stay there!  And if you don't believe in Jesus Christ, get ready to. Thank you, James Caviezel, for your flawless performance.  You've just become my all time favorite actor/actress.  I personally think every person in this movie gets a free ticket to heaven just for being a part of such a motivational, spiritually grabbing, & simply TRUE film. Thank you, Mel Gibson, for fighting for the majority - because nowadays it's the majority of the population that hardly has any representation, Could someone please tell me why that is?  Many institutions want to make us Christians feel like the minority.  Do not be fooled, sisters & brothers!",The Passion of the Christ

1360,SirSinZ,One to be avoided!,2,3 March 2004,"Even though this movie is grossing gross amounts of money in box-office sales, I for one must say it's due to gimmick appeal. The only thing good I can say about this movie is that it's pretty impressive to see a Hollywood picture made completely in foreign and ancient tongues. The movie is subbed 100% and spoken in Hebrew or Latin, but even this wasn't done to perfection. Not an expert on Hebrew, but having studied Latin for several years, most of the words in Latin, despite myself knowing what they were, were completely mispronounced which took away from the whole esthetic of the ancient times for me. Not including the dialog shortcomings, this movie really p**t me off. I'm not even religious and  this Christ story offends me, if I did in anyway care about the subject matter of this film I certainly wouldn't want it sensationalized and commercialized. This movie was a two hour murder scene! Mel Gibson must have figured out that the 3 hours leading up to his murder scene in Braveheart really effected people, and decided to make an entire movie like that. However one cannot make a movie about a murder if the audience doesn't care about the victim, and to care about the victimthey need back-story; i.e.: the 3 hours in Braveheart. Gibson bypasses this rule by doing a film about a guy everyone already knows the back-story to. On the effort to do a movie in Hebrew and Latin I give it a 2, otherwise I'm upset I've even seen this trash of a movie.",The Passion of the Christ

1362,gordoglo,Brutal and all-around awful,4,10 March 2004,"Please don't see this motion picture.Good grief, where do I begin?  Let's start with the heavy-handed script and the fact parts of it seem to be totally fictionalized.  I'm sure everyone is familiar with the basic plot of this movie and how it turns out, but Mel Gibson and/or whoever seems to have taken some great liberties with interpretation.  Characters I've never seen or heard of before, despite having read several gospels, play pivotal roles in the movie.  There's also some made-up scenes -- and not the kind you could excuse to move the plot along.  I do think the film does its best to spread blame around for Jesus' fate, but I'm not sure that's a good thing.  There's something for everyone to be offended by here, unless you subscribe to what I consider to be Gibson's extremist interpretation of the gospel.  I commend the film for its attempt to be unique, but I think the only thing it really succeeds at is polarization: either feeding religious intolerance and fanatacism, or driving further away those who for whatever reason have become disenchanted with Christianity or religion in general.Then there's the violence.  My goodness.  One of my guilty pleasures is bad horror flicks, particularly the Hellraiser franchise (hope I didn't just doom my credibility right there), but nothing could have prepared me for what I saw.  I understand what Gibson was trying to do -- give us a real sense for what Jesus suffered -- but much of the violence in this motion picture seems to be, shamefully, just for fun.  It's almost like Gibson was getting off on it (which, if you saw the O'Reilly interview, he basically admitted, saying it was almost beautiful).  I think there are more fulfilling ways of getting closer to God and spirituality than watching just about every method of torture known to ancient man acted out before you. The person I was with was certain he would have nightmares for weeks -- wow, what a message.I'm giving this film points only for the fine performances and some inspirational words from the Bible and from Jesus.  Not enough for me to recommend the movie to anyone though, even religious enthusiasts.  The only people I see liking this film are sadists, and I think it might even be a little much for them.4/10",The Passion of the Christ
1363,mianom,Awful!,1,11 March 2004,"There are very many people who wrote reviews of this film who seem to be writing a review of Jesus' life and not a movie.  As a director, I would have to say that Gibson has no talent whatever.  I know several high school students who could produce a better film.  The Christians who liked this film are exactly like those misguided medieval monks who used to beat themselves bloody.  The film is not about the life of Jesus or his message. The soundtrack is horrible and does nothing to set the mood for any of the action or to evoke emotion from the viewer.  There was no reason to use Aramaic and Latin.  It was just another stupid trick - like the Bergman devil-in-the-background junk and the demonic children taunting Judas or the endless flashbacks which only serve to mystify viewers who don't know the passion parts of the bible by heart.  There is absolutely no character-development in this movie.  In fact, there are no characters whatever.  No motivations are investigated.  (Why even show Christ's desire to have Mary and James accept each other as mother and son?)  There is no historical background presented. I can name half a dozen Jesus films off the top of my head which are better constructed and do Christianity more good.",The Passion of the Christ
1364,ZilchSr,"Seriously, folks. Are Gibson's true intentions that hard to figure out?",10,12 March 2004,"I don't normally post my opinions online, for a desire to be taken seriously by strangers is futile. However, there comes a time in one's life where they feel compelled to act outside of the box and offer their one-sided dialogue, also known as 'opinion'.There is currently a love-hate attitude regarding Gibson's 'Passion', with no gray area. All reviews I've seen either gave it a zero or a ten on a scale of one to ten, and yes, I meant 'zero'.What I am having difficulty reconciling is of these elitist, sanctimonious, condescending reviewers who evidently wish to redefine Gibson's intentions with this movie. Don't take my word for it, read the reviews yourself: David Edelstein from Slate.com, Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, and the ever-not-so-eloquent Stephanie Zacharek from Salon.com. I can't post quotes here due to IMDb guidelines, so you'll have to do the research yourself.This is but a mere short sample of the self-righteous punditry out there, asking the 'Where is Jesus' teachings of goodness, forgiveness, etc. etc.?'What these monetarily compensated, yet ignorant 'professionals' can't seem to get through their Hollywoodesque, gray-matter-challenged craniums, is that this was not an attempt to relay all of Jesus' teachings, nor his messages, but simply Gibson's portrayal of Jesus' suffering, pain, and death. Gibson wasn't relaying Jesus' beliefs, but the manifestation of those beliefs. Atheists by the millions will not be ""converted"" by this movie, although some may. It was not Gibson's intention to outline Jesus' entire life, but only the last twelve hours.So Gibson didn't include what YOU thought was most important. So what?The simple fact, folks, is Jesus' death is the single-most important historical event of mankind, even more important than His birth. Our salvation wasn't earned by His birth. It was earned by Him through His death. Most people know the most of the facts, however, aren't familiar with the severity of punishment Jesus was put through, during and before his crucifixion. This brutal punishment to a man who did no wrong. This is what Gibson was trying to enlighten us with. If there are any screenwriters or directors out there who wish to enlighten us again with Jesus' teachings, miracles, and other actions he performed BEFORE those last twelve hours, they are free to do so. This was Gibson's movie, and his decision was to focus on Jesus' death, again, the single-most important historical event of mankind, ever. This movie was specifically about the twelve hours before Jesus' death. EARTH TO ELITIST REVIEWER: Jesus' did not conduct much teaching about anything during those twelve hours, as He was too busy earning our salvation for us, so of COURSE there will not be much of His teachings in this movie.For any professional to ignore and distort Gibson's intentions can be summed up only two different ways: 1. These reviewers don't really believe their own reviews but just want to keep those cocktail party invitations coming in from their Hollywood elitist buddies by perpetuating the 'Be cool and hate anything Jesus' Hollywood attitude, which makes their professionalism and credibility shoddy at best, AND/OR2. These reviewers disingenuously wish to redefine Gibson's intentions in making this movie, which makes them propagandists and spreaders of lies.These so-called professionals should just do their job. In case they can't, I shall do it for them:Was the movie compelling? Yes Was the cinematography good? Yes Was the acting good? Yes Was the musical score good? Yes Were the special effects good? YesAdditionally, to those distribution companies who either failed to see a money-maker in this or just plain hate Jesus: How does your $370,000,000 crow taste (at #11 on the all-time U.S. box office gross sales list as of 2006-12-27)Feel free to contact me with questions, comments, and even Jesus-hating propaganda if you're prepared for a response that will make you look and feel inept.",The Passion of the Christ
1365,lambi61,Disappointed due to extreme violence.,5,15 March 2004,"I just saw the ""Passion of the Christ"".  I felt like the entire movie was about Jesus' horrific suffering at the hands of his enemies. I had to shut my eyes, and not see most of the film because I found that I was not only crying but shocked at the graphic violence this film showed. I do feel that the movie emphasized Jesus' suffering and torture much more than giving the audience messages about his life, and who he was as a person.  I just think it's barbaric to watch someone get the life beat out of them for 2 hours without being disturbed.  I realize that Gibson's whole objective was to show how much He loved us to die for us, however, it was overkill.  I would of liked to see more flashback scenes on his life, his childhood with other messages revealed.  I was disappointed.  I think we all know that Jesus was severly beaten and suffered a horrible death on the cross.  I just think we shouldn't have to view it for over 2 hours.",The Passion of the Christ
1366,ssc_sunshine,You experience this movie,10,16 March 2004,"I've watched a lot of movies, but I experienced this one.
Throughout the movie, I found myself gripping the arm rests and crying a river (soaking a total of 5 five kleenex!)Why? Was it because I am a Christian and this is propaganda that I herald? Was it because I felt sorry for the man who was being beaten? Or was it because I am a mindless person who is easily impacted?No...none of these reasons are why I was drawn to the screen. Rather, I saw the reality of what really happened two thousand years ago. Believe it or not: it is a powerful story. A man--claiming he is the son of God--who willingly gives his life up for others. But what this movie shows is that it was more than just giving up of life, but also a surrender to long hours of torture, mockery, and betrayal from people that you love. And yet, at the end, forgiveness is given and bitterness is crushed.Beyond that, I am a believer who has been healed by that blood of Jesus of a serious illness. I've quoted, ""By His stripes, I am healed"" more times than I can count...but for the first time in my life, I really understand what that means. I don't take it lightly any longer. Tears well up in my eyes when I understand what the love behind that bloody sacrifice. He is the God who came near. He has been through all the tests and trials we will ever face.As for the violence, I've watched the Sopranos and many gangster movies. This is not any worse...it's just a different type of violence.

1367,worldchange,"Longest ""fight scene"" in movie history.",5,16 March 2004,"I went to ""Passion"" looking for some form of a spiritual experience. Instead I found myself in an endurance test.  The true message of Christ was conspicuously lacking and the screen time instead was filled with endless literal depiction of Jesus' physical suffering.  Too bad. Here was a real opportunity to spread the Love and it was missed. The cinematography and the re-creation of the period was beautifully done, but it only reinforced the sense that the film was overly concerned with surfaces. In some films this is not a problem, but in this case I had hoped for more.",The Passion of the Christ
1368,cdmerch,Jesus pumped a divine amount of blood,9,17 March 2004,"This movie was absolutely horrific.  I was raised Catholic and have since shirked it off, but this movie still touched me on a completely secular level.  It does us well to remember that we used to do this kind of thing to people (and still do in many parts of the world).The whole anti-Semitic thing is a little silly, by the way.  The only people I've seen even coming close to rioting in the streets over this aren't trying to lynch Jews--they're dumping lambs blood on Mel Gibson.  Chill out, everybody.The only thing that really bothered me at all about this movie is that it seems like Jesus somehow pumped more blood than the rest of us.  I'd wager that the guy spilled more than 6 pints of blood in the course of the movie. It was definitely Mel Gibson Does Jesus.",The Passion of the Christ
1369,ERATOSTENIS,This is how I see it,8,23 March 2004,"I have come to the conclusion that all the talking about the extreme nature of this film, as well as the anti-Semitism that it employs, are commercial tricks to bring even more people to the theaters. I don't pay attention to conspiracy theories, but what else can I think, when everybody around me is trying to make this -only good for video in a cold Saturday evening- product for illiterates, look like a serious attempt to film the character of Jesus. Only in one thing are right the people who attack it. It does have a medieval point of view, long forgotten by the members of the modern society, who consider demons and stuff as fairy tail material and prefer to see the bible as a text, in which you have to read between the lines.
No comments on the artistic skills used for making it. I consider it a very well made movie, with technical superiority. But for the story itself, I am not sure. When watching it, performed with dialogues in a version of the original languages used at the time in Palestine, for more realism and historical accuracy I assume (something that I really liked a lot), I couldn't stop thinking how far from what I've imagined about the Roman army, with its severe discipline, the Romans were presented. The systematic ignoring by the legionnaires, of direct orders given to them by highly superior officers, who see what the soldiers do with their orders but also fail to make sure that the direct orders they took from the highest ranking official around (and anyone familiar with the historical evidence we have about Pontius Pilate knows that he was not a very nice man) will be fallowed to the letter and only give an angry eye to the disobedient soldiers, even if this is happening in a far away country, controlled but not conquered by the Romans at the time, I can only explain as a demonization that Christians, unfamiliar with the science of history, and grown up with stories about the terrible prosecutors of the early followers of Christ, would do to the Romans -who also by the way, use the name Jew as a bad word (where exactly is the anti-Semitism in this film, unless Semites are only some of the Jewish priests off course).Most people appearing in this film are caricatures of characters, even among the disciples and other protagonists of the topic. Monica Bellucci, I think was chosen for the dynamic of her fame, so that anyone who knows her previous roles will get the point without having to let her perform any acting concerning the character that she is interpreting. And lots of stuff in this film, generally I think was left to the Christian education of the viewer. `If they already know something, why bother talking about it. Let's stay to what arouses more the emotion of the believers!' If the archeologists know by now how the crucifixion really was made, but the people are more familiar with the medieval idea about it, started by the hypocritical mother of the first Christian emperor of the Roman Empire, too bad for science! Besides, there are so many beautiful paintings to be inspired from. Why loose the opportunity? George Stevens in his `Greatest Story Ever Told' didn't! And off course, as we all very well know, the Devil Is a Woman!!!I did get my money's worth of 2 hours in the cinema. But I am left with the feeling that someone thinks I'm stupid. I don't know. Maybe it's just me. Maybe it's just.them!",The Passion of the Christ

None the less the movie is very powerful in its depiction of the Jesus final days, and its well acted in all fronts. Mel Gibson should be commented on his passion for this film, and the guts to tell it. I wonder why he would rather put the violence other than explain how he came back but I comment his conviction to put this film out to the public. Jim Caviezel Should be commented as well for his portrayal of Jesus, and Monica Bellucci should be commented as well.I just wish Mel would have giving more to the miracle as well.",The Passion of the Christ

It really made me see and feel what Jesus and his mother went through. It breaks my heart to know that everyone in the world is trying their best to wash him and his name from everyone and everything. I praise Mel Gibson and the others involved in the making of The Passion of Christ for their bravery to have to put with all the criticism from the public and the government. If this doesn't help to make everyone see what they are doing to his name then nothing will. I believe that we have all gotten to comfortable with letting the government make all the decisions as to what we like and don't like for way too long. Good going guys!,The Passion of the Christ
1373,sshrewsberry,"The main point of this movie is that he ""wasn't just a man.""",10,7 April 2004,"I know that everyone has their opinion, but I think that most has forgotten that he wasn't a man like most men today. He was made from god's own soul. He was made to be able to foresee all good and evil. I believe he did go through such pain, yes he would have died from the pain alone if was as weak as men are today.So no, I think the pain that he was subjected to and his lasting power through it all was mainly to tell all his people, at that time and now, that no matter how much pain we are subjected to, we need only to believe in him and the pain would be nothing more than an experience to to make us stronger.I did not look at the making of the costumes or slow motion scenes or any of the such, as much as I looked at the movie as a grim reminder that he did go through horrendous torture just to make everyone wake up and see that there could and should be nothing but happiness amongst each other in the world, instead of killing, hurting and maiming, backstabbing and just pure meanness to each other because of pure jealousy and hatred.As for Mary, yes if it were my son today, I would have made a seen, begged and pleaded for him and I even would have tried to help him by putting myself in harms way. But, there too we have all forgotten why Mary didn't react as we would have today. She knew that when she had Jesus what his future held and why she was chosen. She did nothing because that was God's will. He was made from Mary's and Joseph's body but from God's soul because God needed a human to try and set us all on the path of good not evil. If she would have interfered she would have went against god's will and that would have would made it only that much more painful for herself and for others.I would watch it again, and I also recommend it to all those that have forgotten who they are and where they stand as maker of their own choices.

It is an artistic impression of a significant biblical event, in order to reflect its true meaning. It sounds absurd I know, but this work draws from the same inspiration that made Michelangelo create the statue of `David' the way he did, capturing the same form of aura about it.The film is a specific portrayal of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life, using the New Testament's Gospels as its foundation. If you have not read or are unfamiliar with the text, you could miss the plot, to not appreciate the film's true meaning (which could explain some negative views I have read) and not be aware of his enormous blessings (as He is the greatest man who ever lived). This shortfall is probably due as a result to the film's comparatively limited financial and creative resources.  And yet it has more authenticity and savagery than `Gladiator', and stirs up more empathy than `Schindler's list'.Put into perspective, in many ways this is a quite remarkable achievement, considering it has been created by one man. And he is a multi-millionaire film-star, who funded, directed and adapted the film from one of the oldest books know to man. If this is what the power of faith can do, sign me in.
So why is it so successful? I believe because it is an exceptional attempt at expressing the true meaning of one of the most significant events in human history, the persecution and subsequent crucifixion of the Son of God, as believed by true Christians.Jesus pledged his life to explaining how to truly serve God, also demonstrating his almighty power by performing many miracles, aspects not considered in the film. Instead the focus is on illustrating Jesus's final and most profound message from God. That is no matter what life throws at you, if you keep your sights and faith purely on God, he will save you! This is surely the `Truth'. This explains the way in which he died, as no one should ever feel sorry for themselves, if the World can inflict such unspeakable torture on a man like Jesus, who was perfect in the eyes of its Creator.To Christians or believers in Jesus Christ they will find the film empowers their faith for this reason and to non-believers it may appear as a grotesque piece of filmmaking. Which makes you wonder with Hollywood backing, Spielberg's creative genius (ignoring his perceived conflict of cultural interest) and Gibson's spiritual vision, what cinematic power could be generated?

I had seen every single interview with Mel Gibson that there was. I wanted to know as much about the film before I saw it.  I was there on Ash Wednesday evening, and I was thrilled with the movie.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like the subtitles, but the effect was astounding.  Jim Caviezel delivered a remarkable portrayal of Jesus, and there were many people affected by this film.  Even though it was rated R, some people may not let their children see it.  That is up to the parents' discretion. However, I found the ""violence"" to really open the eyes of those who never really considered what kind of punishment Jesus received.  To answer the question of ""Who Killed Jesus"", it wasn't the Jews, Romans or even me.  It was God Himself who  allowed his Son to be crucified, so that there could be reconciliation between Him and His people.  Once and for all, the price was paid.",The Passion of the Christ

When one considers the film's central theme--that God actually became a man to save us from death--in the end what the viewer is left with is a question: Was Christ who he said he was?If not, the movie from beginning to end is based on a lie.
One can't have it both ways. Either the title character was suffering from the worst sort of severe mental illness, or not. Was he a charlatan? Or was he the Messiah? What power, if any, exists in his blood?
These are old questions, to be sure. Yet the fact that Mel's movie made its way into the top ten domestic grossing films of all time within six weeks of its release says something new about the enduring relevance of these questions today.",The Passion of the Christ

The violence is nothing you'd want a young child to see but I've seen much worse even in movies from people like Stephen King. I saw nothing in the movie that could be viewed as anti-Jewish, just the opposite actually since most of the characters are Jewish. The acting was all very good and the filming amazingly realistic. I have seen many reviews complaining how there isn't enough in the movie telling about the life of Jesus. That's because this is not a movie about the life of Christ it's a movie about his last twelve hours.

It just isn't so.  Germans were involved in murder of Jews but not all.  Nazis imprisoned my father (as a POW) in World War II, Japanese killed my uncle.  I do not hate Germans or Japanese. It is foolish to hate Jews for Jesus.  No one who is not anti-Semitic before the went in will come out anti-Semitic.It was NOT Jews who put Jesus on the cross.  It was the Romans who physically did it, but Jesus is the One who allowed this. Those of us who are Christians are the ones responsible.  As the movie showed, He was crucified as a substitute for our crimes.  He choose to go to the cross - neither the Jews nor the Romans had the power to put Him there.  It was His decision for US.  I am grateful for this movie.Jesus was Jewish, His mother was Jewish, His disciples were Jewish, all earliest Christian leaders from Peter to Paul etc were Jewish.  Simon (who the movie showed as hero) was Jewish.  Overall Jews were heroes in the movie, not villains. Some religious leaders where not heroes - not much different from today - in all religions - there are heroes and villains in every religion in every ethnic group.I find the movie to be fairly accurate at to historical facts - not perfect but very good.  It puts into perspective the physical agony of the beating and crucifixion of Jesus The Christ.I am looking forward to purchasing the DVD when it comes out.",The Passion of the Christ
1381,bananaman572,"Beautiful, but is it a film?",10,13 April 2004,"Well, i went to the passion of the christ with low expectations. A Mel Gibson/Christ partnership didn't really appeal to me, an adament atheist. When i left the cinema, i realised that i had witnessed one of the best made pieces of cinematography ever. I felt not only compassion and sympathy for Jesus, but seriously affected by what i had seen. The Passion made me realise why so many people belive in Christ and in his sacrifice to humanity. I'm not suggesting i undertook an overnight conversion, but for me it gave me a deeper understanding of faith. BUT... I found the ""film"" very difficult to watch. In some parts i felt it had gone beyond a film and had become a peice of cinematography instead. It was brutal, in parts i had to turn away from the screen, but more than that, it was overly produced. I rated it 10, because it was so damn powerful, but i didnt recommend it to any chicks i know!",The Passion of the Christ
1382,eckhart2002,The Passion of the Christ told to adults,10,11 April 2004,"I wanted to see this movie because I was interested in listening to the words of the Bible spoken in Aramaic. Otherwise I was afraid of a new ""Hollywood"" version of the bible with an anti-Semitic Christian fundamentalist touch. I came out of this movie deeply moved. After all this suffering (horrible indeed and even my surgical experience of suffering flesh didn't prepare for what I saw), Christ is able to ask for forgiveness for those who made him suffer. This message of love and forgiveness is the greatest message ever told. We have been drowned in this sweet story of our childhood where everything sounded so nice and easy with perhaps a little note of bitterness during the passion tale. This is not so... Life is often suffering and ripped flesh. We had to see this story told in an adult way to understand it again. And there is no anti-Semitism in this movie! Only stupid first level viewer can understand it this way. My best friends were, still are and will be Jews! Some critics however: the message of the resurrection is definitely too short and too superficial ( after all this suffering it had to be somewhat longer); some horror scenes especially regarding the ghouls frightening Judas are perhaps out of focus (Judas is by the way very human). To summarize, this entire movie is a perfect way for adults to listen to the same story again with an unfiltered approach! The actors are perfect and the camera perspectives are inspired by Caravaggio and the medieval Masters!""Félicitations, Monsieur Gibson""",The Passion of the Christ

I have read the story of Christ's Crucifixion before, and I have a very graphic imagination. nothing I imagined could have prepared me for the violence that was shown in this film. To see all that Jesus had to go through so we would have our sins forgiven just amazes me. I was crying from almost the beginning of the movie to the end. If you haven't seen it,I suggest you do.

The music is excellent and heart touching. This movie will really touch  your feelings. It will make you cry within yourself. The violence shown is too difficult for one to digest, but thats what makes the movie so real. It makes one feel that crucification of Jesus could not be less barbaric than what is depicted in the movie. Although the whole movie is just about crucification of Jesus, every scene fits to the movie so well and you wont feel monotonous at any point of time.

I really cried, it was just so real the scene where Jesus is being tortured. I did noticed that there were some variations in the movie that were totally different from the bible, but what really counts is that it did send out the REAL message (the passion of Christ).

Hats off to Mel & company for the wonderful work that was done. It's about time someone from Hollywood stepped up and proclaimed the truth. There is so much trash coming out of Hollywood these days, that this was nice change.

It made Jesus suffer more in the movie than what he suffered in the historical reality. Think with me : Would you be able, even to walk, more to carry a cross, after being beaten with such suffering instruments? You wouldn't have flesh or blood to support your body. He exagerated to make his point. By the way, have you understand it's point? No. There's no point, but violence. This is just one example of why this movie has no quality. Even the characters were badly directed. What a waste of time. Gibson was the one who won something, besides the religious fanatics around the world, some millions in the box office, letting the film be released by the Easter, making families go to the movies and being there no more than one hour. It's just one more adaption of what everyone should keep to himself, his faith. Shame on you Mr. Gibson !",The Passion of the Christ
1389,space_cadet1985,"Vicious, mean and cruel",1,28 November 2004,"I finally saw 'The Passion Of The Christ' yesterday. I had heard many things about this film, including that it was anti Semetic. That wasn't the case at all. However, I thought it was just two hours of vicious, mean and cruel display. I liked the first forty five minutes or so, but then it got to be just vicious for the sake of it. I wish it had shown more of Jesus's life before his death (his murder.) I enjoyed the scenes in which we, the audience, saw the ""real"" Jesus. I think my favorite was the flash back showing Jesus and Mary together when Jesus made the table that was ""too tall"". It was nice and showed a personal side. I do enjoy films that are gory and creepy, but I found this one to be just over the top cruel. It was just overdone. More and more torture was shown, different scenes, same stuff. I usually enjoy Mel Gibson-his writing, directing, acting-but, this didn't do anything for me. Better luck next time, eh? Jim Caviezel was excellent as Jesus. I can't imagine how difficult it must've been to play that role. Learning a new language, going through the physical demands...lots to deal with. I think my favorite character was Satan, played by Rosalinda Celentano. She gave a terrific performance. I thought she was haunting. I don't think I have ever seen a better portrayal of Satan in any other film ever. Even with a couple of excellent performances, this film lacks way too much to be considered a great film.

The film is brilliantly shot and the town of Matera is a good stand in for first century Jerusalem.

This film is probably the highest-grossing film made about the death of Jesus. Therein lies the problem of this bloodfest-It's about the DEATH of Jesus.While Mel Gibson claims that this is supposed to show how much Jesus went through for all humans and how he died for our sins out of love, I found none of that in this film. All I saw was two hours of some guy getting tortured.Gibson made the mistake of focusing too much on how he died and not at all on WHY he died. The scenes of torture is downright disgusting, and by the end of the film, I almost lose sympathy for Jesus. If I did not know the story,I certainly would not know why he was being killed.The film does nothing to tell us why he died, that he died for our sins. The film doesn't even take time to develop him, or make us connect with him on a human level. mel is too concerned with making blood spill and making Jews look bad. This film has a few good parts though. The scene of Jesus making a table and chairs for his mother while she brings him lunch is touching. The movie could have used more scenes like this. This film moved me all right- It moved me to vomit. Gibson should be applauded, however, for his drive to create this movie.

I can't begin to say, how wonderful the acting of these actors were. Jim Cavizel was extraordinary. All the actors were superb. They were spectacular!

I cannot judge the story as much because I do not know that much about it, and herein lies the first problem. Mel Gibson made this movie for only people who know everything about the Bible, so when someone like me watches it we have no idea who most of these people are, the character development is very little and the story is sometimes incoherent as to what is taking place. I felt the score didn't fit certain moments and was over dramatic at times. The costumes were a joke, they looked brand new and they could fit in a Mel Brooks parody because of how fake and cartoonish they seemed. His final walk, while tragic, was way too long and repetitive, showing Jesus get up then fall, get up then fall, get up then fall, over and over again. I get that it is trying to make a point about his suffering, but by the end I'm bored, not emotional. Some good things were the little flashback sequences (my favorite being the last supper ones because they show Jim Caviezal has acting ability instead of being a moaning flash bag), but some of them seemed random and had no point to me. My favorite part of the whole movie is when he is being put up on the cross; at that moment everything was pulled off very well and I almost felt something. Sadly that is the only moment. *****Begin Spoiler*****The end is laughable, Jesus is in the cave and is resurrected, but all we see is a body bag being crumpled like a bag of chips and then Jesus sitting naked next to it. *****End Spoiler***** My final complaint that I think all Christians should feel is that this movie took advantage of their faith. Instead of trying to make an honestly moving spiritual movie, he creates a snuff film to incite guilt and make us feel sorry for a man that got the **** beaten out of him. If anything we should focus on the words of Jesus to inspire faith, not how he died.",The Passion of the Christ
1396,MoonGlorious,Jesus falls down.......FOR TWO HOURS!!!!!,6,26 April 2006,"This by far isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, But it is HIGHLY overrated. First off, putting an ENTIRE movie in slow motion doesn't make it more dramatic. It just makes it very slow and very boring. Second, the movie is one big plot whole. What about the people who don't know Jesus and came to see this film in order to learn something about him. When they leave this movie all they know is that Jesus was beat up and fell down a lot. Finally, the whole falling down thing. My imagination is probably bigger than anyone reading this, but I'm quite sure Jesus didn't fall down for the last two hours of his life. I understand he was tortured a lot and was probably very weak, but the man walked on water! He could do anything, He was the son of God, But some how he has terrible balance.

1397,vitaminb0,Simply over rated,1,27 December 2004,"Wow! How so many people think this movie is ""brilliant"" or ""a revelation"" is beyond me. The first thing I will say is the slow motion shots of Jesus falling down became almost comical (seeing as how there were like 20 of these cookie cutter scenes spread throughout the movie). There are so many of these scenes that if you skip from chapter to chapter on the DVD you will see that it is like the same scene of Jesus hitting the dirt to begin almost every chapter in the middle of the movie. Second of all, the ending was ridiculously cheesy. God's tear falling from the sky with the dramatic music? I honestly laughed out loud at this silly scene. And third, the music. Oh my Christ, save us from that annoying booming mixed with Arabic wails spliced over the soundtrack. This has to have the most annoying score in the history of film. Now keep in mind, I am not bashing the film based on any kind of religious view. I am bashing it because it is a terrible movie. The anti-semitism controversy as well as the over hyping of the violence is completely ridiculous (seeing as how it was the Romans who did the actual crucifying and the violence was pretty much minimal and pretty sloppily done if i do say so myself), but if you want to see this because someone told you it was an excellent movie, steer clear. Most of the people who will tell you this are either so stead fast in their beliefs that they will not admit this movie is a complete and utter waste of time or this is the only movie these people have seen since 1980. As a final note, people who say this movie changed their life and made them re-embrace their religion are extremely weak and need to be put in psychiatric care immediately.

The focus on realism and historicity of this film was astonishingly powerful and moving.The characters were simply memorizing. The score similarly was uplifting and touching. In short, I was moved and still get moved when I watch this again and again. Obviously this film is not for children as the brutal elements of the Roman cohorts and dominance in this film is hard to watch at times, (e.g. The Scourging and the crucifixion scene) nevertheless this was the way torture was applied 2000 years ago, and Mel does not deviate from this.I really hope in the near future that we see either a movie by Mel Gibson on the Resurrection and life of the early Christians during the Roman persecution in Rome.

I've found a spiritual connection with this film that I find with no other. It gives grace a whole new meaning. The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking. The violence did seem a tad exaggerated, but I didn't have a problem, as it seems to illustrate the spiritual battle Christ had to endure as well as the physical.As I said before, the film inspired me. As a young filmmaker myself, it reminds me that sometimes, the message is more important that the ""marketability"".

(After all, that form of death is where the word ""excruciating"" came from!) Having read the New Testament accounts of Christ's death, I must admit that it bothered me to see how movie writers, directors, and producers could provide blood, gore, pain, and realism in everything from war movies to dinosaur flicks... but when it came to Christ's crucifixion, they suddenly became shy. For example, ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is a classic movie, a real epic, and one of my all-time favorite films. But even it fell flat in showing what the Gospels tell us happened to Christ. According to the New Testament, his punishment made him virtually unrecognizable, yet actors playing the role were repeatedly shown on the cross with little more than sweat on their brow and a few bloody stripes across their backs.Do I want to see brutality in living color for the sake of seeing gory images? No. But neither do I think the death of Christ should be downplayed when in EVERYTHING else, realism is hailed as an aspiring goal. What better way to show Christ's ""love"" for mankind...his ""passion""...than by showing in graphic color what the Gospels report occurred? Is such a film for the faint of heart? If a drop of blood disturbs you, then this film will send you reeling.

And when the movie took in so much money, I thought ""Woah! this is ridiculous!"" Of course, I hadn't seen the movie at the time, so I wasn't 100% sure. Well, now I have seen it, and I can say, anyone who says its good, let alone great, is either a movie-n00b Christian (this isn't meant to be offensive to them, its just the case with most) or has never heard of it.OK, here's the moral of the film: Jesus comes apart REAL good. Chunks come out of him easier than chunks come out of a session of Quake II. But the thoughts coming out of my mind weren't ""Oh my god, he suffered like that for us?!"" They were ""God, look at all that realistic blood!"" The violence in this movie is dressed up. It's supposed to be expressing Christ's suffering, but all it real exists for is for controversy. And, as you know: controversy=$ Now the movie does have a decent LOOK to it. the cinematography is good and the Jesus does look realistically, uh, beaten-the-crap-out-of. There is a glaring flaw: Jesus is white. Jesus is NOT white people!!! Moving on, the acting seems good at first glance, but that's just because you can't hear WHAT they are saying, you have to read it. When you think about it, the acting is INCREDIBLY overdone and melodramatic. This movie also has very little narrative. You're supposed to take at least 30 minutes to introduce everyone effectively. Granted, I assume everyone knows who these people are, but this doesn't excuse the weak first act of this movie. This movie has a pretty weak script. Not even the dialogue is good. When someone talks in a movie (though there's subtitles here) it needs a ring, realism, and it shouldn't be direct. The lines here are rather straightforward. FInally, and worst of all, this movie is horribly, horribly pointless. All it is is a bunch of Romans wailing on some half naked guy for 2 hours. Uplifting moment in cinema my foot! You all know where it's going, this film says very little, and you knew everything in this movie already. In conclusion, anyone who says its a great film is an ignorant, religious fantastic. I'm going to call this the most overrated movie of all time (passing my previous vote, Once Upon a Time in America). Why would anyone go see this when they can move to the theater next to it and watch Eternal Sunshine or Million Dollar Baby?

It reminds me of how the enlightened messages of Love Jesus was trying to share with people were just lost, vanished, poof, gone, in how humans attempt to interpret there own understanding of what he was sharing by the limitations of there own point of view.Mel Gibson did just that. Interpreted his understanding of what Jesus would want to share with millions of people and I find this to be highly irresponsible. I am shocked to think that so many people were so deeply moved by this film of torture and pain.This must be the same group of people who refused to see the movie The Last Temptation of Christ, which was brilliant.I sat through the whole movie waiting for some enlightened message or moving moment and it just never occurred. Instead, just a message of sorrow, pain, suffering, guilt, fear. Kind of puts in perspective why this world is still having so many problems. I mean, come on. Just what does Mel Gibson and the fans of this movie believe Jesus was trying to teach them? There was no message of Love in this movie about Jesus, who wanted nothing more than to convey this message to these confused humans.

1405,JRLnew,"The Passion: Strength, Hope, Passion",10,1 February 2005,"""The Passion of the Christ"" is a foreign language film with subtitles. It is a very complicated movie that shows a lot of hard emotions, and the drama involves the torture, beating, and crucifixion of Jesus Christ. In order for a foreign language film to win in America it will have to be so brutally realistic that all of the details and photography are ingeniously shown, the scenes organized with uncanny virtuosity, and the frames woven together like an epic poem. The film succeeds in this, as well as offering a ray of hope at the end when Jesus Christ ascends from the tomb. We could pick at straws and say that Hollywood is the author of this film. Many films about the life of Jesus Christ are educational, instructional, and informative. What is unique about ""The Passion of the Christ"" is the drama, like no other movie before it, and the detail that is shown as the plot develops. The centurion guards ride on their high horses and knock the crowd around, argue, scream, and even call each other idiots. Meanwhile the prayerful and quit friends of the accused and betrayed Protagonist desperately plead with them to end the madness. The texture of each scene highlights the conflict to a fever pitch. And who would be cast as the Protagonist in a movie like this? ""Forgive them Father."" The Protagonist is the betrayed Savior of course, but how many people would argue otherwise? Look at the alternatives. Could Pontius Pilate play the lead? ""And what is truth?"" Pontius Pilate sounds more like a monster than a hero, and the loud and vicious mob only throw stones and spit. Are they the Protagonists? I think not. Hollywood made what is known and real come to life on screen. In order for the conflict to be accurately resolved a real threat must be identified, and that threat is seen in the face of the murderous Barabas, the apathetic Roman leader, his sissy wife, when confronted with the real master of creation, the Lord and Savior whom all of the Holy Scripture speaks about and is now present and real, defending us from ourselves, on screen, with wisdom, strength, power, and love. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is an awesome movie. The movie has something for everybody. For the Christian it shows the drama, the triumph, and the unbreakable courage of the Lord God in the face of hundreds of false accusers. For the student this movie offers an authentic recreation of the language and the setting of the day in which Jesus Christ lived and taught. And for the skeptic this movie provides a way to really understand the scripture for perhaps the first time. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is nothing less than a monumental achievement about an epic man who was and is also God. Amen.",The Passion of the Christ

This is truly a masterpiece.I love how the kept the original language; Hebrew. It feels more real. I am still wondering if Jesus (and many others in this movie) were actually white. Are they not in the Middle East, where most of its inhabitants are brown skinned?I also love how Jesus' character is in tact. He is modest, straight- forward, loving and brave. That's my savior for ya.What bothered me is that the beating may have taken a bit to long. I mean that some scenes where Jesus falls due to the weight of his cross seem too repetitive. I feel that the movie could have devoted more time to the life of Jesus as well as the Crucifixion, rather then just showing flashbacks.Overall, this is my favorite Jesus movie. As it is RAW. Blood, gore, and all. That only makes it more emotional. Those who do not believe in God can at least get a view of what happened in this historical beating of Jesus as a human. For a believer, I can't help but shout ""Hallelujah"" to my king and best friend, Jesus. Who took the nails for someone like me...God bless you all-Mike",The Passion of the Christ
1407,Jenimay,Mel does Well,10,6 March 2005,"If you ask me, (which you didn't) I will tell you all that this movie was done fairly well. Having been in a bible study for many years, Passion of the Christ is quite close to what Christians believe as ""Gods honest truth"". Now there is the religion war itself which is ridiculous. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion however we stand under one God. Now some of the details may or may not be correct based on what your personal belief is. I believe Mel's heart was in this 100%If you are wise enough to believe in God you should believe in loving one another, forgiving those around you who ""wrong"" you. Mel Gibsons portrayal of that is right on the money. Truth of the matter is, none of us were there and blind faith leads us in what we pray is the right direction. What we hear in church becomes somewhat mundane about the passion story. This movie puts into clear vision what and why I, and many others, believe what I do. Watch this movie with an open heart and a box of Kleenex. I pray for all of you who gave a negative review and ask you to watch it again and believe. Believe that God who created us only wants the best for his children and is why he gave us his only son. I say two thumbs up. The two God gave me.",The Passion of the Christ
1408,maidmarcia,Passion of the Christ,10,1 April 2005,"In quick reply to the comment above...I watched Passion of the Christ. Being a lifelong devout Christian, I believe I had grown to take Christ's death for granted. Then along comes this amazingly brutal yet honest movie; and while crying in the movie theater and remembering all that Jesus did for us, I give Mel Gibson kudos for (perhaps unintentionally) creating a movie that reminds us of how much we must be grateful for.Yes, the movie was pure Catholic, especially when it came to the stations of the Cross and etc., but that does not in any mean that it could not and did not effectively minister to people. It ministered to myself personally, and from the faces of people around me in the theater, it ministered to many others.",The Passion of the Christ
1409,saraclark71,"More than a ""movie"" -- its an ""experience""",10,11 April 2005,"Three times viewing this visual, emotional, and spiritual masterpiece is not enough for those who, like me, perceive this film to be more an ""experience"" than a movie. Even as a devoted believer in the deity of Christ, it is easy to forget the indescribably painful sacrifice that He made on behalf of all humankind. However, through the beauty and artistry of this film, Mel Gibson has been able to depict this sacrifice in a way that helps one to understand the reality of what truly occurred. To ensure that all human souls have the chance for meaning during life and a home after death, a price was paid by one man alone - the only Son of God, the Messiah, our Savior Jesus Christ. And to be reminded of that sacrifice in such a visceral way can only be described as a worship experience like no other. Thank you Mr. Gibson for your vision and direction and for all who contributed their talents to bring this ""experience"" to life for believers and for those who will come to believe because of this film.",The Passion of the Christ
1410,calling_luna,Emotionally Manipulative,3,12 April 2005,"I thought maybe since the plot of this movie had a religious basis that it wouldn't be just like every other Mel Gibson movie...but it was. The gore is just uncalled for in many places. I have no doubt that Jesus was mistreated and brutalized, but the degree of blood and guts in this movie is intended to get a rise out of people. It made my lunch rise, that's for sure. Some parts were very well done, especially the parts with Mary/Jesus interaction, though they are few and far between. Satan is creepy and all, but he is a bit overdone as well, and very much associates himself with the Jews. Pontius is portrayed in an interesting way that may not be entirely accurate, but that's subjective. It gets a three from me simply because of the Mary moments. Other than that the symbolism was blatant and some of the history was totally wrong (Jesus did not speak Latin!). Leave it to Mel Gibson to turn wonderful history into a fictionalized emotional roller coaster and an inspiring event into a melodramatic gorefest.",The Passion of the Christ
1411,liamt-2,The Best Bible FIlm,8,8 June 2005,"I was quite apprehensive about watching this film, as I had heard tonnes and tonnes of hype about the immense amount of gore contained within it. I am not a big fan of gore in movies, as I believe that most of the time it is completely unnecessary.Nevertheless, I thought that, as a Christian, it was my duty to at least sit through this film and be able to say that I had seen it.I thought that the film itself was excellent. Yes, there is a lot of gore and the whipping scene was one of the most harrowing sights I have ever seen in a cinema, but it is all necessary to achieve the purpose of the film.The main purpose of the film is to make the audience realise, more than any Bible extract or eye witness testimony could, the sheer extent of the pain that Jesus Christ went through in the last hours of his life.People who have criticised this film have argued that it doesn't make us sympathise with Jesus by showing extracts of what he accomplished in his life. But that is not the point of this film. The audience that this film is aiming to appeal to already know all about the story of Jesus' life. But when they read about Jesus' crucifixion, the full extent and intensity of the pain Jesus endured cannot be comprehended quite as fully as it can in this film.I personally feel that this is the best Bible film that I certainly have ever seen, as it doesn't try to gloss over any aspects of the story it deems too intense for the audience. It depicts full on and graphic torture, which together with the superb acting, contributes to a tense and harrowing piece of cinema which brings us closer than ever to fully understanding Jesus' sacrifice.If you are looking for a film which can stand on it's own, this isn't the film for you. However, if you are looking for an unadulterated, undiluted account of Jesus' final moments, which will strengthen your religious belief, then you must see this film.",The Passion of the Christ
1412,batcave2005,One of The Best Movies from Mel Gibson: The Passion of the Christ,10,30 April 2005,"I'd been looking forward to seeing this film since the day I first read a rumor that Mel Gibson was going to do a film about the Passion entirely in Latin and Aramaic. I knew this was going to be a very special film long before it made headlines and became the center of great and unnecessary controversy. Yesterday I was not disappointed. Josh Sewell has already put it more elegantly than I can when he writes, ""I've been rendered nearly speechless... The Passion of the Christ... defies the typical 'it's good' or 'it's bad' mentality of a review. It's so visually gripping, so heart-wrenching and so emotionally draining that writing about it simply can't do it justice."" The film begins at night in the garden of Gethsemane in Jerusalem. Jesus (played by Jim Caviezel, an actor I have great respect for ever since his excellent performance in Kevin Reynolds' film of The Count of Monte Cristo) is betrayed by his disciple Judas to the high priest Caiaphas and, next morning, brought before Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator of Judaea. Originally, Gibson had intended The Passion of the Christ not to have subtitles, saying that the acting was to convey enough of the story for subtitles to be superfluous. Later he compromised and had the film subtitled. The subtitles do make the details of the story clear, so this particular compromise was not a bad decision, but I suspect from the generally quite stylized acting that Gibson still intended not to have subtitles while he was shooting. That the Passion was filmed entirely in Latin and Aramaic was a stroke of genius, and part of the great lengths Gibson went to in order to achieve a sense of historical accuracy. I certainly cannot fault his portrayal of the Romans: they do admittedly speak Latin with an Italian accent (partly because the actors are Italian, partly because they were coached by a Jesuit who presumably pronounces Latin consonants the medieval or modern Italian way), but they speak it fluently, as if it really were their everyday speech, and all of them look right and act perfectly, and their clothing, armor, weapons and hairstyles are completely accurate as far as I know. Pilate himself is actually played by a Bulgarian (which is audible in the way he pronounces the letter L) who really looks the part and manages to convey a lot of powerful emotions restrained by military and political discipline.Caiaphas demands that Jesus be executed for blasphemy. Pilate refuses but, terrified that he will have a bloody uprising on his hands which will result in his own execution on the orders of the Emperor, orders his second in command, Abenader, to have Jesus severely punished in the hope of appeasing Caiaphas. Abenader unwittingly delegates the task to a group of sadistic soldiers who cane Jesus and then, probably provoked by his incredible stoicism, scourge him. The scourging is one of the most horrific and bloody scenes I have ever seen, and rightly so. The film has been criticized for being sadomasochistic, a criticism that is idiotic. We are bombarded every day with scenes of violence intended as entertainment, desensitizing us to our detriment. The Passion of the Christ shows violence for what it really is in all its true, disgusting, dehumanizing horror, a horror that takes on a further dimension when I consider, through my tears, that I have just paid to watch a man being ripped to shreds while the people all around me munch loudly on popcorn.Caiaphas is not satisfied and demands that Jesus be crucified. Pilate tries one last time to avert the inevitable. He tells the mob that they can save one condemned man from execution and tells them to choose between Jesus and Barabbas, a murderer. To his disbelief the mob choose to pardon Barabbas. Jesus is to be crucified.Another criticism of the film has been that it is unrealistic in that, amongst other things, Jesus is forced to carry his cross to Golgotha after having been mortally scourged. Do I need to point out the irony here? When Jesus falls on the way and seems unable to continue, the accompanying Roman soldiers rope in the unwilling Simon to share his burden. When Jesus falls again, Simon finds that the cross the horrifically injured Jesus managed to carry a part of the way on his own cannot be born by an able-bodied (but mortal) man.Finally, the crucifixion. As Josh Sewell points out, ""Most films about Jesus... make crucifixion seem slightly unpleasant"". The Passion of the Christ shows exactly what this hideous form of execution really entailed.This is one of the best movies that Mel Gibson has directed.",The Passion of the Christ
1413,crimeofpassion,Worth seeing it once just to say that you had.,3,17 December 2005,"While The Passion wasn't exactly horrible, it wasn't that great, either. If you'll look at it as JUST a movie and ignore the content, it was absolutely horrible. It was nothing more than a non-stop gore fest. And, as one of my friends has said before, it's something that never should have been made into a movie.There were few things that I actually liked about the movie. The first would be the fact that all of the actors looked Hebrew. Jesus actually looked the way Jesus would have looked. He wasn't black and he wasn't some pale, frail little blonde man. He looked Hebrew and he looked strong, and that's what the real Jesus would have looked like.Though I know some people hated it, I also liked the subtitles. In that time, they didn't speak English, so why have them speak it in the movie? I liked the fact that the ""thirty-nine lashes"" were far more than thirty-nine. Though I've never read it for myself, I can still remember my mother explaining to me that ""thirty-nine lashes"" was the Jewish law, and the Roman law had no limit. Christ was convicted under Roman law, and therefore he would have received far more than thirty-nine lashes. I like that Mel Gibson showed this.I also really liked Mel Gibson's portrayal of Satan. Angels (even fallen ones) are supposed to be very beautiful and very androgynous. Shaving her head and eyebrows, then dubbing her voice with a man's was ingenious, really. That's all the good I can actually say for this movie, though.My world history teacher told us that this movie was historically accurate, and if we went to see it and brought back our ticket stub as proof, we would get an extra credit grade. So why not? I'd been planning to see it, anyway, after all. And so came two hours of brutal beating and torture. An hour of which was spent by me flinching and looking away from the screen, glancing back from time to time to see if this newest piece of violence was finished yet. Two hours of wasted time for a grade I really didn't need.It's nice to be able to say that I've seen the movie, now. But it really wasn't worth it. This should have never been made into a movie. All it brought was people becoming even more fanatical about Christ just because they saw a movie. It brought a new wave of people claiming that the movie promotes anti-Semitism. Was it really necessary? If people really wanted to learn about ""the passion of the Christ,"" they could have just read the Bible.",The Passion of the Christ
1414,fteago,"Review ""Passion of the Christ""",9,21 October 2014,"Review ""Passion of the Christ""Mel Gibbson's ""Passion"" – is a fantastic movie. It has gotten some criticism from Zionist's, catholic priest's etc. – this critique is completely unfounded – since the movie – regardless if you are religious or not – is a great achievement, in depicting the historical, semantical context, and in depicting religious ideas that's behind the whole Christian religion. Costumes in the film are excellent, as is the actors performances: all the way from the roman soldiers, the Jewish-priests-cast, the devil and Jesus himself. The movie is bloody, but this can not be an argument against the film, since being tortured, and crucified by Romans 2000 years ago, was no pick-nick without blood and great torment in the extreme. Critics who speak against this movie on this fact's, are either unrealistic, or do not understand there own religion if they are Christians that is. And Jewish fractions who claim the movie is antisemitic, should probably come to terms with what is considered historical facts. The movie is not about bashing any folk/people, it is a message about suffering, hope and ideas. I – my self – am not a religious human- being: but enjoyed the film very much, it provokes great feelings in any human-being – who can imagine the historical and emotional forces that were – and is – in play according to Jesus passion. Regardless of what ideas you live by, this is interesting.",The Passion of the Christ
1415,neilsilverius,a meditative film,10,10 March 2017,"This film is not something one watches for entertainment value.This film was made with great effort by director Mel Gibson after much reading and research. It is definitely not a film a non-Roman Catholic can make since they only believe everything that is in their version of the Bible. One has to understand that everything passed down (including the Bible itself) has elements related to Sacred Tradition. Therefore, a non-Roman Catholic make a good film, but it would never surpass to this greatness.The same goes for a viewer who watches this film. Without understanding the context of the subject matter, one views it simply from a human perspective. This is not entirely bad because you can still relate to the suffering and torments endured by Jesus Christ. To really appreciate this film, you have to view it through the lens of the Catholic Faith.Now on to the film, it is perhaps the best film on the last 12 hours of the life of Christ that can be humanly made. The reality of it is that if we were to view the Passion of Christ through God's eyes, it would be so much more worse and we would probably die from seeing that. To understand what the Son of God did for selfish humanity it all it's wretchedness and sin. Beautifully shot, very poignant. I would recommend reading not just the Gospels (obviously) but also reading Life of Christ by Fulton Sheen and reciting the Stations of the Cross. One has to contemplate this suffering to have a conversion of heart and understand that it is God here that is being depicted, not just some religious leader like Buddha or Mohammed. Finally, all the bogus accusations of anti-semitism that the media spew out is nothing more than the liberal leftist agenda that is godless and feels some sort of inferior complex because this is a film that can shake your conscience (if you contemplate it).",The Passion of the Christ

The special effects and acting were also pretty good.However, my main problem in the movie came from the lack of sex. As far back as when they were created, exploitation movies have thrown in random acts of sex/nudity to help create contrast to the violence on screen. Contrast is important in all works of art, even exploitation movies like this.Please don't take any of this the wrong way, I love Jesus. In fact I think I love him more than any of the other so called 'Catholics' on this so called 'website.' I love Jesus and I certainly would have loved to have seen him stripped to the skin (rather than have his skin almost stripped off).There are other movies in this genre that have been doing quite well recently. If I recall correctly, SAW didn't have any nudity either.But SAW was garbage. Absolutely filthy. Just degradation of the human spirit and body.

Aesthetically, there are discussable choices in the almost splatter display of Jesus' sufferings, but the point is above all that Gibson, a narcissistic director, tragically unprepared to deal with issues, should just continue to play action movies. In several European countries, other than of course in the United States, there have been groups of racists and Christian fanatics who have seen in the Passion of Christ a sort of manifesto against non-Christian of all sorts.

This movie isn't a concept, it's a drawn out snuff film featuring someone who just happens to be a prominent religious figure. If you want a film that will make people appreciate Christ, it needs to show why his death is important. His good works, etc. I wasn't religious before I saw the film, and seeing it only reaffirms my belief that nobody has it right.

1431,robertglassmeyer,The Rape of the Christ,5,21 January 2006,"With respect to those more learned in theology and spirituality than I, and while I'm carefully trying to avoid shock value and melodrama, the word that comes to mind when I think of the Passion of the Christ is ""rape."" I'm not a theologian or a scripture scholar, and I try to balance the often times precarious position between being a person of faith and a critical thinker - but I can't escape the image of rape when I reflect on this movie. While the movie does not depict the actual genital violation of Jesus, I think a case could be made for there being unmistakable psychological and emotional rape. I've seen this movie with my wife several times (it sometimes feels like several times too many), and watching the Roman soldiers enjoy, delight in, and essentially become aroused by the torture they are causing Jesus, is sickening. It reminds me very much of the rape sequence in ""The Accused,"" wherein the men who rape and terrorize Sarah Tobias are having fun. I shared the idea of rape in the context of The Passion with a co-worker of mine, who also strives to be a critical thinker as well as a person of faith, and he could very much identify with that. Again, I am not seeking shock value or melodrama - but I think the experience of this movie helps me to make some very important connections. First, this kind of movie, with its graphic violence, often emphasized in slow motion, accompanied by heart-wrenching music, runs the dangerous risk of degenerating into the glorification of violence, which is, among other reasons, why I believe NO PERSON under the age of 16, and preferably 18, should be permitted to see this movie. This is NOT a ""family friendly"" movie. At the time The Passion was released, my brother had only turned 18 - and I would have hesitated to take HIM to see it. I certainly would not take an adolescent parish Confirmation class to see it. If I was a seminary dean (and I was in seminary for a time), I would think twice before taking a freshman class of college seminarians to see it. Second, one of the times my wife and I saw The Passion was on Good Friday afternoon, after we attended the Solemn Liturgy of the Passion at our local cathedral. I did make, I believe, a significant connection between what we celebrated at the Cathedral and the images in the movie, particularly in terms of the the institution of the Eucharist and the raising of the cross (and I am not seeking to preach here, and for those unfamiliar with these terms, I ask your patience!). BUT, the movie WAS NOT, for me, a substitute of the Passion Liturgy; in fact, I felt more united to the faith dimension of the sufferings of Jesus during the Liturgy, NOT during the movie. Third, I've witnessed a frightening association between religious fervor and violence in many contexts, and I think, if people aren't careful, such a movie as The Passion can perpetuate the blurring of religion and violence, in much the same way as many movies depicting rape dangerously blur the distinction between sexuality and violence. When my wife and I first saw The Passion, we were so mentally and emotionally drained, we got some dinner to settle our nerves and went home to take a nap - we were totally exhausted by the experience. Having had better than a year to have some distance from the movie, and reflect on its implications, I can find many more constructive ways to work with the images and ideas of the sufferings of Jesus than Mel Gibson's movie (and I mean no disrespect to Mr. Gibson). The Scriptures, the Liturgy in the Roman Missal, and Franco Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth would be first on my list.",The Passion of the Christ
1432,Father-Tiresias,A Work of Art,10,5 March 2006,"I am not a religious person. My family is Christian, maybe some people would choose to hold that against me. I will say, I love movies, and this movie is fabulous. First let me say this: all movies can be propaganda in some way. All movies can be offensive. The best artworks are the ones that raise controversy. That said, ""Passion"" is a perfect work of art. Whether you believe in the story or not is beside the point. This is a fiction story, and a beautiful one at that. It is the same thing as a book being made into a movie. Mel's reworking of characters and the plot line is called artistic license, Jackson did the same thing with ""The Lord of the Rings."" Mel Gibson is NOT antisemitic, and neither is this movie. The techniques utilized in the film are brilliant. The Lucifer character (portrayed as neither male nor female) is chilling (it is not laughable, as some might say). This is a symbolic work of art, and it does not preach hate. Pay no heed to the liberal whiners who would have the film boycotted and ignored. While not an easy movie to sit through, it should be viewed by all people who love movies for what they are; a story told in a work of art. ""Passion"" is a wondrous work of art, and very moving.",The Passion of the Christ
1433,Ralphie7,A misguided attempt at portraying the factual story,5,28 February 2004,"As a pastor, I saw The Passion with the expectation that I would find the movie not only challenging, but also something that I would recommend to my congregation as a visual representation of the final twelve hours of Jesus' life.  However, after seeing it, while I would not try to dissuade anyone from seeing it (as I believe that people should think for themselves and make up their own minds), I would strongly recommend that people understand what is in the Gospels concerning the crucifixion to be able to see those things in this movie that Mr Gibson adds to the story.  A few examples.1.  While it is a part of the Catholic tradition, the only part of the journey from the Pratorium to Golgotha is Simon of Cyrene being brought in to help carry the cross.  The rest (Jesus falling time and time again, Veronica wiping the face of Jesus, etc) is all a part of tradition and not based on the Gospel accounts or any other historical record.
2.  The way that Mr Gibson has the Jewish leaders following Jesus every step of the way is contrary to Scripture as well.  They arrest Jesus and take him to Pilate.  However, that is effectively the end of their contact with Jesus (at least as is recorded).  The Gospel of Matthew As they would be strict followers of Jewish law, there is no way they would be even close to the amount of blood that Jesus was spilling throughout the movie.  A Jew who came in contact with blood would be considered ceremonially unclean.
3.  Again, tying into the representation of the Jewish leaders...When Jesus dies upon the Cross, the Scriptures record that there was an earthquake and that the curtain in the Temple (the one that separated the main area of the temple from the Holy of Holies) was torn from top to bottom.  However, Mr Gibson chooses to not only tear the curtain in two, but also the entire temple as a large crevice breaks open in the center of the temple.  This not only is contrary to the Biblical account, but it also sends a message about Mr Gibson's view of the Jewish faith as a result of the crucifixion of Jesus.These are only a few of numerous examples - many others could be listed. Mr Gibson not only combined the four Gospel accounts (which is a dangerous thing to do as each were written at different times for different audiences for different purposes), but he also adds a significant amount to the movie that is not based on Biblical (or historical) fact.When The Last Temptation of Christ was released, there was a great outcry about how Jesus was represented in that movie.  As a result, a disclaimer was put at the beginning of the movie noting that it was a work of fiction and was a reflection upon an unexamined area of the life of Jesus.  The Passion of the Christ should have a similar disclaimer because there is just as much fiction in this movie (if not more) than in The Last Temptation of Christ.  The fact that Mr Gibson portrays this movie as being a purely factual account is disturbing if not outrightly reprehensible.
While The Passion is a gripping, well-made movie in a technical sense, the fact that it contains such a great amount of fiction parading as fact leaves me to give it a very low rating and feel hesitant to recommend it to others.",The Passion of the Christ
1434,ToriBridges,"Exceptionally well done, high risk film for Mel Gibson.",10,25 February 2004,"This is an amazing film, and the most emotional movie-going experience I've ever had. This film is as painful as it is truly excellent, and highly provacative as a historical and religious film, categorically similar to the genre of which ""Schindler's List"" is a member -- that's where the similarities stop. I have never been so moved by any form of art before this film, and probably never will again. Mel Gibson's film is brutally honest, necessary, and brilliant. I have so much respect for him in taking such personal and financial risks, as well as for the actors and crew in partaking of much of the slander and ridicule that this seemed to create. This is not a hateful film in any way, and even those who do not know the Gospels or the story of Jesus could not come away thinking it is anti-semitic in any way. The performances were outstanding, but the true performance was given by the movie itself, and the walk we were taken with Jesus as he faced each step of torture and mutilation with humility, and amazing grace. I am so glad that this film was made, and that Mel Gibson was able to translate this story as close to reality as he did.",The Passion of the Christ
1435,jbrule1,A Movie to Miss,1,31 March 2004,"There are two kinds of bigots/racists/anti-X's: intentional and unaware.Ask an intentional bigot what they think about the group they hate, and they'll tell you, in no uncertain terms.Ask an unaware bigot, and they'll tell you that some of their best friends are X, and they'll often mean it, or at least that they know some members of that category.Unaware bigots are still bigots. And they cannot be the measure of whether what they said was offensive. They can only report whether they intended to offend, and their answer will only pertain to the bigotry that they are aware of. The only one who can confirm that a statement, etc. is offensive is the offended party. Saying ""Oh, I didn't know you don't like to be called a Kike"" doesn't make the statement unoffensive.I had a co-worker who believed some of his best friends were Jews. He used phrases like ""I really Jewed them down on that one,"" knew I was really concerned about saving every last penny, etc., etc. He was a bigot. An unaware one.Bigoted statements/positions/etc. are offensive, whether they were intended or not. When they are not intended, then we must take greater pains to educate the person as to the effects of their speech, etc. But we still must identify them as offensive.Mel Gibson's movie is offensive. It is virulently anti-Jewish. There is no subtlety to his anti-Jewish message, and him simply saying ""I didn't mean it that way"" doesn't diminish the offensiveness of his message.He is an artist, he has the money to make his film, yes it is his right. And yes, there may be parts of this movie that some Christians find rewarding or moving. But that doesn't change the fact that this movie is offensive to Jews.It proposes - without subtlety of any kind - that Jews demanded the death of Jesus over the objections of a kind, understanding Pilate (nothing could be further from the truth), and that they demanded this in a rabid, monstrous fashion. It places priests of the temple throughout the plot, at every turn cajoling the continued suffering of Jesus from caricatured Roman guards, who take cartoonishly unbelievable glee in delivering pain. It cuts back and forth between images of the Devil walking with the Jews and images of the grieving Mary. It gives Jesus a line that explicitly blames the Jews over the Romans. And it makes all but a few women in the crowds of Jews throughout the movie villains who waste no opportunity to kick, beat, spit and otherwise bring pain and humiliation to Jesus.I say again, it is not subtle.If Gibson believes as he professes - that he is not anti-Jewish - then he could have attached a disclaimer to the beginning or end of the movie without impacting its message. But he did not.If Gibson believes as he professes - that he is not anti-Jewish - then he could have drawn the same story from a gospel - there are four of them, after all! - less vehemently anti-Jewish.If Gibson believes as he professes - that he is not anti-Jewish - then he could have refrained from leaking early screenings that were even more egregious to drive up controversy, and ultimately sales.
If Gibson believes as he professes - that he is not anti-Jewish - then he could have refrained from trotting his father out to vomit his preposterous charges that the Holocaust was a hoax to drive up controversy, and ultimately sales.This movie is anti-Jewish. Gibson may or may not be in his thoughts, but through his movie and his marketing of it, he is in his actions.

1436,jastewart,Not as bad as I expected,4,3 March 2004,"My expectations were low, given my negative reaction to Braveheart and the fact that I am not a believer. The cinematography was first-rate, though, and the acting was good for the most part. I didn't find it particularly anti-Semitic (that is, not much more so than the Gospels themselves).Still, I'm left with the question: What's the big honkin' deal about this particular death (assuming it did occur in roughly this way)? Think of how many more mere mortals died in similar agony, many at the hands of the Catholic Church and many who were innocent (though not in the Christian sense--we're all guilty because of that thing with the apple in the Garden of Eden, right?). Willingness to endure suffering and death to spare his many millions of children from eternal torment is the least I would expect of a perfect Deity--heck, I would at least consider enduring it for my one daughter. Wouldn't you expect an omniscient, omnipotent, and perfectly spiritual being to have a rather high tolerance for physical pain? And being omniscient, He would have known for certain that he was bound for glory--unlike the rest of us, who have to rely on faith.So again I ask: What's the big deal?One final note: I found the androgynous Satan scary, but also amusing.

When I saw the movie, though, I flinched every time one of those sticks or whips went across Christ's back.  But that isn't what affected me the most.  What affected me was when Christ was on the cross and the one thief begins to insult him.  The other thief makes the point that Jesus is innocent, while he and the other thief are getting their just punishment.  When the repentant thief simply asks Christ to remember him when He comes into His kingdom.  That resonates within me, because at its most simple, that's what we Christians are.  We are dying and we simply beg for a rememberence that we honestly don't deserve.5/5 stars",The Passion of the Christ

The music also added a lot to the film as did the brief flashbacks.However, I was hoping for a slightly more accurate account. I found a couple of scenes drawn out, which perhaps didn't need to be. I would also have liked to have seen a bit more background to the story through more flashbacks as I felt that the only reason I knew what Jesus was doing was because I have done a lot of previous Bible Study.Overall I was touched as a Christian and thought it was a powerful film, but I felt a bit more could have been said while shortening a few scenes.",The Passion of the Christ

Just watching the people leave the theater after watching ""The Passion,"" you could see that this movie had impacted them in a way I had never known a movie to do. There was a stunned silence that surrounded them; a silence which spread to the merry crowds around them and brought an almost reverent hush to the lobby.To deny the power of this movie is to betray one's own prejudice. The true movie critic must admit the effect this film had on the majority of those who viewed it. The honest reviewer must give due credit to the film and the director.

1441,stucarrier,Another disfigurement of The Pieta,1,26 March 2004,"I found Mel Gibson's Passion to be visually repulsive and spiritually diminishing on the basis that the director's obsession with the physical degradation of Jesus completely overwhelmed what should have been the transcendence of Jesus' spiritual message.  A moment that captures this obscene imbalance occurs when Mary cradles Jesus' body at the foot of the cross in a conscious emulation of the pose of Michelangelo's immortal Pieta. The image is spoiled by the totally ruinous desecration of Jesus' physical body.  I thought of the sick soul who attacked and damaged The Pieta with a hammer in the 1960s -- and Gibson's imagery prompted me to mourn that The Pieta, as one of the greatest aesthetic and spiritual icons in human history, has been damaged again, this time by buckets of squib blood.",The Passion of the Christ
1442,deepsix,This is simply one of the finest films I have ever experienced.,10,25 February 2004,"Attending a prescreening of Mel Gibson's `The Passion of Christ' hosted by St. Bartholomew's Church, Nashville, Tennessee, I was apprehensive as a result of the pervasive news stories released regarding the violence of the film.  Hollywood has released worse, a good example of which would be `Natural Born Killers,' so I find the complaints about `The Passions' violence disingenuous.  I would not recommend taking your kids to the film until you have first screened it.Neither is this film anti-Semitic as has been charged.  Rather than making us think that the Jews were the Christ-killers, it is clear that Jews, Romans, and Christians all had a hand in his suffering and death. Betrayed by Judas, denied by Peter, handed over to the Romans by the High Priest of the Jews, tortured and put to death by the Romans, one can hardly walk away and say that the Jews were the only culpable.Subtitled, `The Passion' is played in ancient forms of Aramaic, Hebrew, and Latin.  The surprising thing is that the subtitles seemed to disappear. Fifteen minutes into the movie it was as if I understood the languages.That said, this is an almost perfect film, a film of such haunting beauty that I cannot think of any film to compare it to.  The violence is neither underplayed nor overplayed, although I have only hopes that it was overplayed.  Satan's temptation of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane is at once eerie and familiar.  Christ's divinity is to a certain extent underplayed, or rather it is played subtly.  We see only one miracle Jesus performs on another, but this only serves to underscore his forgiveness and love of mankind.  It is clear that the Christ forgave his tormentors and with his death, expiation for the sins of mankind is accomplished.  Satan is cast down.",The Passion of the Christ

I was concerned that the use of subtitles throughout the movie would distract me from the screen but I found the fact that the entire movie was done in languages other than English a more true perspective. I did not find this movie to be anti-Semitic (as some have said it is). If anything, it is anti-Roman. This movie also gives great perspective as to what Jesus' mother went through in the final hours as well.

1445,JonMalice,"Great as a religious film, but disappointing and mediocre as a drama",4,1 September 2004,"Just saw it last night and as a depiction of the last hours of Christ from a religious point of view, it was certainly breathtaking in terms of its depiction of the cruelty he suffered and the sacrifice he is said to have made.But as a drama, it was poor-to-average.Weak three-act structure, little rising tension, poor characterization (except for Judas and Pilate who experience true inner conflict about their roles and -- in one scene at the beginning -- Jesus, who clearly doesn't want to die but decides to do his duty).None of this is the fault of Gibson, who wanted to stay close to the Bible's version of events, but violence is not drama and some parts of the Passion come across as little more than a messiah snuff-film.Few of the characters change or grow in any meaningful way -- the have much the same beliefs and attitudes at the beginning as they do in the end. As a result, the entire film seems episodic: a bunch of stuff that happens.For the faithful, no big deal, because it brings to life something central to their lives. And they can enjoy the movie much more because they bring so much of themselves and their beliefs into it. (This is also why I believe many take the criticism of the film so personally -- an attack on it comes across as an attack on them).But taken solely as a drama, minus the religious, cultural or historical baggage, there's not much to it.Our much-conflicted protagonist Jesus chooses to submit to god's will in the first scene of Act I and the only meaningful conflict or decision he faces thereafter is pretty much whether to stand for more whippings. From then on, it's two hours of torture and people crying.Not sure what else Gibson could have done, given the source material, but it makes for a long 2 hours and 15 minutes.If you're a Christian, definitely see the movie; you will appreciate it greatly (""enjoy"" seems the wrong word, given the relentless graphic violence).But if you're disinclined toward an abiding belief in the Bible, this is probably a movie to pass on.",The Passion of the Christ

We have read and heard the passion story many many times over the years, but seeing it gave us some new insights.  For one, it caused us to think about how quickly the entire set of events happened.  When reading it, it always seemed like there were long pauses in the story where they had to travel to see Herod; travel back to see Pontius Pilate; and wait for the crowds to make their decisions.  The movie made things seem like things moved very quickly...in the space of just one 24 hour period, it all takes place.Another insight was that there were many factions in Jerusalem at the time -- the Roman representatives, the Pharisees, the regional ruling class, the general public....all these groups had something at stake related to Jesus' fate.We did not find anything controversial in the movie.

What makes this film different is the use of the original languages that were spoken with English subtitles also the brutal depiction of Jesus' scourging at the hands of the Pharisees and the Roman soldiers.

Who were we?  Who ARE we today?  What a lot of shame we deserve.  We hurt him - made him carry that heavy cross - nailed him to wood and hung him up.  And he prayed for us?  He loved us still.

If we can kill Jesus - there are no boundaries as to what our hate can do to ourselves.  Why not love your enemy?  Like Jesus said - what reward is there in only loving those who love us?

Funny, how Hollywood has never been willing to ""tap into"" the immense market for solid Biblically verified movies.

This vision lacks in depth, subtlety and, worst of all: humanity. This one-dimensional view on bad and good only leads to unnecessary judgement, bigotry and violence.

1452,newyorkr,I was a skeptic/critic but now think the movie is a masterpiece,9,29 April 2006,"When the initial wave of press came out regarding Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, I reacted to the release of the movie in pretty much the way that the press said I ought to react. I was cynical that Mel Gibson was making a summer blockbuster movie about Jesus's death for the religious fundamentalists. I didn't like that the movie blamed the Jews for the death of Jesus and I thought, how could you make a film about Jesus anyway, and not focus on the good works during his life. I felt all of this without even having seeing the movie and I have resisted watching it until now.For disclosure, I am a born Catholic but have hewn far to the left of middle when it comes to following the Church.So for whatever reason, I decided I would cue up the Passion on Netflix. The disc arrived and I popped it in the DVD player on a Friday night after work, expecting a violent movie, but not really prepared for the visceral emotional experience I was about to have.In short, yes, the movie is incredibly graphic and violent, however in retrospect I didn't find that the violence was gratuitous. Indeed, it is about Jesus' Passion, or suffering. The feeling I had in witnessing the pains of Jesus in His execution was not excitement and suspense like when you witness the violence in a regular action movie. Instead, I felt utter sadness and pain and I often found myself crying uncontrollably. I cried when Mary watched as she stood by, unable to stop the punishment that her baby boy was experiencing. I cried when Peter realized he denied Jesus. I felt much as Simon, the man who helped Jesus carry his cross, felt. I was initially hesitant and wanted no part in this suffering of Jesus, but after helping Him carry his cross, I just had to weep and cry uncontrollably.What this movie has done for me was put a truly tragic human face and element to the stories from the Gospel that I've heard year after year during Easter, and it moved my cynical soul very deeply in a way I really did not expect.One of the few criticisms I have of the movie is that the way the end of the movie is framed (with the music, the cinematography, etc) brings on the feeling of a Hollywood action film waiting for the sequel, i.e, ""The Passion of the Christ II: the Resurrection of Super Jesus"".",The Passion of the Christ

My favorite scene was when Christ was being lifted on the cross: the music swells triumphally, Mary and others stand up and one senses the victory over sin and death.

It was basically a summary of some scenes from the Bible done in a boring and anti-Semitic way. The high priests were made out to be complete barbarians, the devil continuously appeared for no apparent reason and the movie was shot in a language that they didn't even use in that district! It was violent, yes, (indeed at some parts of the film a few members of my class screamed out loud in horror) but I was unable to feel any sympathy for any of the disciples or Jesus due to a shallow portrayal of them which gave no insight into their characters.",The Passion of the Christ

Now I'm all for people going on killing sprees, but lets keep it inside the realm of realism please. (Spoiler) In one scene, Jesus crucifies a Jewish priest then dances around him and sings. The amount of anti-semitism in this film is ludicrous. Senseless slaughter of Jews, remind you of anyone?

I've seen many stories of the life of Jesus Christ, but never did I know the punishment he went through in such detail, the scourging & the beatings. Some might say that the violence was too much, I say the violence was accurate and needed to be seen, how else can one realize what the Messiah did for us.I felt no bad feelings towards Jewish people before, during or after this film, It's completely historic that the Sanhedrin & the Pharisees wanted Jesus Crucified, so there was nothing new in the movie, but the Romans enjoyment of beating the Lord was something I hadn't witnessed until this movie.Great movie, must see, Christian, Muslim or Jew...

1461,notaryplus,The Greatest Story ever told,10,26 February 2004,"Today, I had the chance to see an amazing and very bold film. With all the reality tv we have to watch in prime time it was a chance of a lifetime to see the Reality of life 2000 years ago. How Christ was treated when he entered the city and How he was scurged by the romans and their bloodsport loving demeaner. The Pias self satisfied ""Holier than thou Priests""I doubt any one of us could ever sacrifice themselves like that today, go through that immense pain and torture to save mankind from ourselves?! I have more respect for what ""The son of man"" did for the human race then I did before going into this experience. I felt I was on the road ""Via Dolorossa"" the way of suffering watching this film made his life real and so important. Sin is apart of our Human nature but as he told us thru the Gospels ""Love one another as he has loved us""His message was always about a Father's Love, a Father's Sacrifice he gave one to save all.

1462,Innagroy,Portrays the truth,10,18 June 2007,"The Passion of Christ should not be judged as a regular film. I have heard plenty of people tell me that it was boring. It was not created to entertain. It was not created to make people laugh, it doesn't really take on any new perspective on the story of Jesus. It does exactly what it was meant to do. It portrays the truth. And, usually, the truth does not happen like in the movies. A portrayal of real life and death, of truth, can seem boring compared to today's funny and witty films. However, when portraying the most famous man on the planet, the truth is what we need. This is a film for people who are so used to hearing about Jesus' death that it no longer shocks them. This is a film that is meant to shock. It is meant to be a wake-up call. It is not meant to be enjoyed. It's meant as a reminder of the price Jesus paid.",The Passion of the Christ

However, when Gibson burst forth with his vile anti-semitic rant last week, I thought now is the time to compare the movie with the rant. On a vileness scale the movie comes in as a 10 to the rant's 8.But, my biggest objection is that this movie is just not believable. To depict Pilate as afraid (or even moderately respectful) of Caiphas is a joke. Remember, Judea was a militarily occupied land. Pilate was Caesar's number one boy, beholden only to Caesar. Jesus was a local do-gooder, upsetting the Roman realm. An early times Gandhi, Martin Luther King.Fairy tales are succor for the faithful, so I guess if you're more interested in faith than fact this one is right up your street.",The Passion of the Christ
1464,yamamema,Open your eyes (SPOILERS),10,6 September 2004,"I'd like to start off by saying that this story about the most influential person in the world, ever. Whether or not you have been influence by Jesus or not, because of Jesus Christ we count years from and before his birth to tell history. Because of him the bible is the most sold book ever. Because of him the crucifix is the most recognizable symbol in the world. Because of him atheists and theists alike say his name whether out of reverence or in vain, on a daily basis. I could go on, but my point is to say that if there is any one person who you can assume everyone knows the story of his life its Jesus Christ.Now of the stories of Jesus Christ there is none more important than his death. Whether you are a Christian or not, there is a huge chance you know this story. Examples of this is quotes such as 'cross to bare' referring to a burden one must carry as Jesus carried his cross, and 'I wash my hands of this' referring to being freed of responsibility as Pontius Pilate washed his hands of Jesus' blood. Around the world you couldn't say everyone knows the story of the little red riding hood, don't cry wolf, or the three little pigs story, but you can say they all know the story of Jesus' death if not various stories of his life. And if for some reason you don't know this story you at least know that Jesus is a man that has had his portrait taken by more people then any other, is responsible for the biggest religion in the world, and who accomplished this by being a loving, peaceful, humanitarian, teacher, who died for all of humanity. The reason I give this entire intro is because of the only critique of this movie that hold any water, is the characterization. It is true there is very little building of character in this movie. Now having said that, take a look at what I started writing above. This man does not need his character to be built up. So you can tell this story two ways. One, you can inform the vast minority of people, if they exist, who Jesus is, and make a long and boring movie. Or, tell the story to the intended audience and focus on the emotion of the story. And speaking of emotion, if you happened to climb out from under a rock and have no idea who Jesus Christ is and you go to this movie, if you can't feel remorse, sympathy, and empathy for a man who is clearly, repeatedly willing to give his life for the sins of the world, which includes you, you are as cold as the rock you climbed out from under.It has also been said that this movie is too graphic. To these people I say, you simply did not watch the movie, specifically the title. You must have been in a dream state or refusing to catch what was going on in the movie. The movie is called The Passion of the Christ. It is repeatedly told to you that Jesus is willingly giving his life for the sins of mankind.Not only is he giving his life, but as you can tell throughout the movie he knew exactly what he had to go through to do it. To start off the movie Jesus prays to God to spare him from what he must go through (look at that he knew). He is sweating blood! The devil comes to him and says the sins of the world are too much for one man to bare. Jesus admits he is Jesus, knowing the soldiers were going to take him to trial, he foretold the betrayal by Judas. He admits to being the son of the living God, to the Jewish high priest knowing they would condemn him to death. In a flashback you see Jesus himself telling the apostles that he will not be with them tomorrow. Jesus tells Pontius Pilate that he was born to die for the sins of the world, and then latter refuses help from Pilate. The point of Jesus willingly dieing for the sins of the world is hammered home in so many ways, it is unimaginable that anyone can walk away thinking that the Jews killed Christ! Now if the point of the movie is to show how one man gave his life for the world (not another, the world) how is showing how he gave his life, 'too graphic.' Its one thing to hear about someone giving there life for another, its quite another to see it. We have all heard the stories of crucifixion, but never did we realize the reality of crucifixion. It is a quote in the movie, Jesus says there is no greater love then for one man to give his life for another. So 'The Passion of the Christ' is in everyway an appropriate title, because it not only attributes the original meaning of the word passion, 'the pain endured,' but the modern one which is love. The point of this movie is to show through his death, the greatest act of love ever. This movie is great in every aspect. The cinematography was impeccable, every scene was perfect, not to over the top and subdued when it needed to be. Wardrobe and setting were both original and believable. Cast was great, mostly or almost entirely unknown actors allowing the story to tell itself without audience bias from a-list actors. On top of that, the cast you can see was chosen not only for their acting ability, but to allow for the place and time to become seamless not only because of there appearance but because of their facility with the Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic languages. I was particularly impressed with the directors' ability to tell this story that as been told countless times and breathe a breath of fresh air and somehow make this two thousand year old story, anew. This was accomplished by his ability to tell the story with minimal dialogue and various storytelling vehicles. The acting was great, again to convey emotion and evoke a response with very little words spoken. The entire cast was great, so I hate to single out anyone, but Jesus, Mary, and Pontius Pilate were on another level. And finally, everything was accentuated by the flawless, superb score. Without a doubt the element of the film that would grab anyone and everyone. On a final note, I'd like to mention that because of the religious nature of the film, it by virtue becomes a polarized film. So when I talk about Jesus 'baring the sins of the world' and such talk, half of the world would probably stop reading this review. But why, I am after all just talking about a story. If your not a Christian, you need to watch this movie like you watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In the same way you don't believe in wizards, but can enjoy Return of the King, so you should be able to enjoy The Passion of the Christ even though you don't believe in Jesus Christ.",The Passion of the Christ

1466,j-richard,After viewing the passion of the Christ,9,12 September 2006,"The passion for myself was a reconnection with my own faith and also a deeper understanding of the message. The stark realism and hauntingly beautiful soundtrack gave this film a realism that transformed it above many weaker biblical films about Christ, although one of my favourites will always remain Jesus of Nazareth, starring Robert Powell.The teachings of Jesus didn't need to be passed on during the passion, because there is already a sense of what Jesus has left in the hearts of his listeners, and his suffering, crucification, and resurrection cements the sharing of gods message in our hearts.After viewing the passion i remained transfixed to the screen watching the final credits fade, emotionally i felt drained but uplifted at the same time my heart felt heavy and the images remained with me for a long time after. The visual style of the film is that striking that i can easily access characters and scenes with much clarity and emotion.This film has reawakened my faith in the lord, and after viewing felt compelled to purchased my own bible, intent on reading the gospels, I know feel i have a greater understanding and relationship with our lord and for that i thank Mr Gibson for bringing this extremely important film into our lives.",The Passion of the Christ

The way Mel Gibson directed this and the way the actors played their characters was without a doubt Oscar worthy. I have read comments on this site that say the movie lacked a plot and some other comments that say Mel Gibson doesn't know how to write a movie. To these people I can only say, You need to read the title of the movie. There is no writing this movie. It has already been written. It is a story of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. You can't ""write"" the movie, you have to stick to what happened. As far as not having a ""plot."" This is the story of what Truly happened. You can not change the events to make the movie more interesting. Mel Gibson stuck to the story and made the best movie possible. There is nothing that could have been done to make this anymore real. Yes it may be violent, but I am sure that with as violent as Mel made this, it probably wasn't even nearly as violent as when it really happened. This movie is telling a TRUE story and I don't think it could have been done any better. This truly was an amazing movie and for those who can't agree with that, I have no idea what movie you were watching, because this certainly was one of the best I have seen.",The Passion of the Christ

I did not think The Passion was at all the great theatrical event people have made it out to be.  Looking at it as a film and not a passion play, it wasn't that great.  There was about 2 hours of beatings with twenty minutes of flashbacks to ""love your enemy"", and that isn't enough to make a movie decent.  The visual aspects of the film were great in the sense that the actor looked like he was in some pain (a few shots did look like Gibson swiped the cotton balls from Don Corleone.)  The performances of the actors was adequate, there were not major weaknesses in the performance of the cast, but again, they were just suited for their respective roles.  I understand how ""faithful"" people could be moved to tears from this movie, and I've seen them...daily, walking out wiping their eyes, but in looking at it as a piece of film instead of a religious awakening, I don't think anyone should need a tissue.Alas, droves of folk has been coming to see The Passion, and given my current station in life, I get to give my humble opinion to them when they ask me what I thought of it.  To sum it up in a sentence, ""It wasn't as good as Braveheart.""

1469,SashaK911,believer?,10,25 February 2004,"What I saw tonight in Mel Gibsons work of art tonight was just that.  Mel has put together one of the most valuable films of this generation and all time.  While ""The Passion of the Christ"" is about the last 13 hours of Christ, it is also about everything that Christ stands for.  I am not religious but agnostic, I do not feel the need to go to a church or that one person has suffered for all of man's sins.  I do believe in a basic human goodness and a way of living that involves harmony and understanding, and while I know the bible and I watched, what for the most part is a very graffic and honest portrayal, I never felt that I was being preached to. I felt the struggle that Christ went through and the passion that he felt for what he believed in and i left in awe.  I closed my eyes at the end of the movie and thought about life and the way that I live it.  I realized how closely I hold myself to my beliefs and how they related to the movie and I felt only happiness that I am living a good life and I prayed that those who feel misguided can find it within themselves to become happy.  I can say nothing bad about this movie and for anyone that says that the Jews are shown in a poor light then I ask that they open their eyes to see that the movie was more about the wisdom of the jews that were not afraid of losing power and the compassion that they felt than about the limited few that were afraid of losing power.

Jesus WAS killed by Jews UNDER the Roman soldiers. I believe people find a movie like this BECAUSE it deals with Christianity... and find all the wrong in it and manipulate the truth and what the movie stressed. the movie stresses what happened.. and the passion for the Christ, not anti-Semitism.

1471,mjudkins,One Atheist's Opinion,8,1 March 2004,"Even as an atheist I found this to be a powerful film experience about one of the most influential men in human history. I thought the performances were solid and was pleased that the movie is in Aramaic and Hebrew. The essential story - no matter what your opinion of Jesus - is that a good and innocent man was tortured to death because certain individuals were threatened by his radical thinking. The thing about Jesus that appeals to me as an atheist (if he existed at all) is that he was an original thinker who, in an age of horrendous global brutality, taught love and forgiveness, and moreover gave worth and meaning to the ""lesser"" individuals of society: the crippled, the sick, the ""sinner,"" and all those who were rejected from worshipping in the elite temples due to their social status. Although not specifically depicted in the movie, this thinking went against the status quo of the time so you must extrapolate with prior knowledge some of the antagonism that members of the traditional elite society might have had against him.I suppose my major complaint with the movie is that there was not enough back story. The movie opens in Gethsemane, where he is betrayed and captured by Jewish soldiers who run the local government under the auspices of the Romans. However, you never really get a feel for why certain Jewish leaders were so hostile towards him, other than the crime of ""blasphemy"" and their ostensible charge that he sought kingship. I would have liked to have seen his disturbance in the temple depicted when he overturned the tables of the money changers because such a disturbance would have made the Jewish leadership look ineffectual in controlling the populace from the Roman perspective. But, I understand that a director has to limit the scope of a movie to the essential story. Still, I felt what was missing were the reasons the Jewish temple elite held hostility towards Jesus, reducing them in some respects to the ""bad guys"" of the story. Reality is seldom that simple however.The most interesting character is Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor. We are given a man torn between condemning a man he knows to be innocent, and pardoning him which could likely incite riotous unrest and possibly bring about his own death at the hands of his superiors for not maintaining order. His is a very interesting character study in a lose-lose situation.The other character which could have been great was Judas. His being torn by guilt was excellently portrayed, however I felt the scene was cheapened by the whole devil episode and the harassing group of children and especially the lame CGI demon which jumps out and spooks him. Instead of allowing the actor to express the torment of guilt emotionally, cheap tricks are resorted to.I was hoping that the ""magical"" aspects of Jesus would not be portrayed and we be left with a more humanistic study of this man, Jesus. For the most part I wasn't disappointed. There is the scene of Jesus restoring an ear that gets lopped off, and a brief resurrection at the end. I would have rather had Jesus attend to the man's wound than actually make his ear grow back, but that's how the story goes so we can just let the believers believe that. For me, the earthquake at the moment of Jesus' death seemed a little too much, but again, that is part of the Bible story so I don't fault the director for such melodrama.The violence is severe and intense, but appropriate. Those were violent times. The film, however, also displays a few scattered scenes of compassion by Romans and Jews alike. I particularly liked the compassion of the wife of Pilate and the Jewish man called upon to bear part of the burden of the cross. These small glimmers of goodness shine brightly in contrast to the pitiless cruelty of executioners. [I suppose I've never understood why Christians think his death on the cross expiated ""sins"" since the act of dying accomplishes nothing (except for the end of suffering), and those who have suffered more gruesome deaths than Jesus' aren't thought to have expunged anyone's sins. Death doesn't ""save"" anyone. It makes no sense to me.]One last thing: a lot has been argued about who killed Jesus. My answer is, ""Who careth?"" Certainly many Jews were key players in this. Certainly many Romans were incessantly cruel in their scourging and torture of their daily victims. But who killed Jesus is incidental and irrelevant to how that relates to people today. All the culpable parties died over 2,000 years ago. Anyone who would project the culpability of others onto their descendants is ignorant and immoral. In the same sense, it is malignant to blame white people today for slavery that occurred centuries ago. Once culpable parties are deceased the issue of blame is no longer relevant, only incidental. I don't think Mel Gibson intended for this movie to be controversial in the way it has been. Maybe it is human nature to seek scapegoats, but if people only love the ones that love them ""where is the reward in that?"" Whether Jesus was real or not, I think all people could benefit from the story of what Jesus taught and bury old grievances.8/10P.S.

You will find yourself in a state of prayer as you realize what you're sin did (does) to our Savior. You will ask yourself questions like, is my sin really that bad?  Am I that much of a sinner?

The actors were truly amazing, and very serious for their roles of the film. The reason why I chose to watch this film, was for my Grade 11 History Project. I was very impressed in how they made the beating and torturing of Jesus Christ look so real, and so intense... it had me in tears. I was upset that the second disk wouldn't read, so i am now stuck writing an analysis, summary, and report, on only the first half of the movie. The plot, the lighting, and the music, all played a magnificent role to set the mood and atmosphere of this movie. Over all, i enjoyed the movie, up to where i got cut off. If i get the chance to finish the whole movie, i can definitely say that i would enjoy, and maybe even be grateful of Mel Gibsons wonderful, and mostly magnificent re-making of Jesus' crucifixion.",The Passion of the Christ
1483,nd78,Mel Gibson's Project,4,2 April 2004,"After one and a half hour I left my comfortable seat and headed for the exit of the movie-theatre. On the one hand I already knew what was going to happen, on the other hand I was not very keen on watching how Christ was going to be tortured by others. I am neither in to realistic blood-scenes nor to such brutal injuries, Christ had to endure.But everyone has to be aware of the fact that such things as they are shown in Mel Gibson's Movie happen every day in diffrent parts of our world. Ppl are tortured to death, ppl have to endure awful pain... don't forget - they are among us - angry, brutal and insane ppl - who like torturing peaceful men, women and even children.From this point of view Gibson's Movie shows mankind's insanity towards others... and it still happens nowaday.",The Passion of the Christ
1484,mmejido,you don't have to like something for it to have meaning,10,25 February 2004,"Just came back from it... don't really know what to say... Everyone is going to crap on this movie just as they crapped on Last Temptation of Christ... and that's their loss... and as LTOC succeeds in showing Jesus with human frailties and doubts, Passion succeeds heavily.. HEAVILY.. in showing the physical pain of the Passion. There are faults, yes, there are weaknesses (re: overdramatic symbolism, but there are precious few movies that exist that you actually ponder over after you've seen them... for me, Passion was one and I have a newfound respect for Gibson's strength as an artist. I'd like to see how much of this was actually HIS movie... because even though Braveheart will be the much better liked film, Gibson was adament about showing the violence of battle in it... and if this is going to be one of his main themes and issues he wishes to get across in his career, he gets the theme across MUCH BETTER in this film than in Braveheart.... in Braveheart the violence is 'cool'... in Passion you really don't want to watch it because it hurts... and i think that's what MG is trying to get across.I ain't religious at all... and I came in expecting the movie to win me over... it didn't win me over, but it did get my respect and certain parts made me cry.Certain movies should come with warning that states ""This film is not for entertainment purposes"". But you know, getting nailed to a cross ain't exactly a pretty thing... and just as Leone first showed a gun firing and hitting its human target in one shot without cutting in ""Fistfull of Dollars"", Gibson smacks the ********** out of Jesus to get a point across.... He wants realism so that you will FEEL and is going to make you drink Jesus's blood so that you feel what his main character feels too.",The Passion of the Christ
1485,brewser,Commercializing the last 12 hours of Christ.,1,15 March 2004,"The movie captures roughly counting 9 minutes of dialogue from the new testament. There is no clarity as to which Gospel the story is based on. There is nothing much to add to those 9 minutes of story in the Bible. Hollywood really shows its true character by turning the story into a gore flick. What message do we get from watching this movie?
Passion is suffering!The movie shows many similarities with George W. Bush's foreign policy of Shock and Awe by deliberately twisting the facts. The scenes in which Pontius Pilatus is helpless and the Pharisees are merciless do not help Gibson in adding credibility to the story.The Passion of the Christ is too Roman, too violent, too long, meaningless and historically incorrect. It is therefore probably bound to be a hit (at least in the USA)!",The Passion of the Christ
1486,LiL x PrNcS,And to each his own... (spoiler inside),10,29 February 2004,"This is the kind of movie that will mean different things to different people. Some may hate it, some may love it, some may be completely grossed out by it. It can be violent and bloody, annoying and boring, beautiful and heart-stopping.I just want to reflect how I was moved by this film.I would like to thank Mr. Gibson for making this movie. It helped me, in some ways, strengthen my faith. There were many questions in my head about my own Catholic faith and beliefs. And while the tears were rolling down my eyes in the movie theater, some of them were answered.Most people know the plot of this film and that's not the point of this movie. It's nothing new, revolutionary, or anything unique. It is simply a moving piece of art, that will put many on an emotional rollercoaster. It will make you sad, angry, guilty, happy, disgusted... and any other you can think of.[(SPOILER)]
I found the sequences of Mary and of Satan especially moving. Jesus' plight was emotional and heartbreaking, but Mary was incredible to me. Being a Catholic, I've grown up always being asked ""Why do you believe in Mary?"" by other Christian religions. Now I can answer them as ""She was a woman who truly loved her son and a woman who I believe loves me the same."" And with Satan, he was creepy and reinforced an idea that my mother always tried to teach me, that he is always there, watching us and working his evil on us.
So this movie may not be well reviewed, or receive an Oscar, but it is beautiful in that when I saw this movie, I felt, I learned, and I walked away from the theater feeling like that $10 ticket wasn't enough.",The Passion of the Christ
1487,luke-57,A Depth of Love that Defines History,10,1 March 2004,"What can you say after seeing this movie?  I quess it depends who you are. During the movie, and accounts of the same in the Bible..peoplereact different to what Jesus did and who Jesus is. ""Who do men say that I am?"" No person in history has ever spoken as He did, say what you will, scoff if you like, spit on him, laugh at him, or fall to your knees and say, ""truly this was the Son of God.."" How you react, as others did to him in the story, defines really WHO YOU ARE. As the characters around a perfect person were defined and who they were was shown. Blood thirsty animals, laughing drunks, indifferent masses, inquisitive yet politically bound rulers, devoted mother, humble criminals.  The movie will reveal who you are as you see ""the-truth"" bruised for your sins,....or so the scriptures say....I was deeply filled with a sense of his love as I saw or was present at the killing of the son of God.  I don't care who you are go see this movie, it is historically accurate and if you can accept it, that was God hanging on the cross....or so the scriptures say...",The Passion of the Christ
1488,patriotview,"Awesome, stunning, overwhelming",7,25 February 2004,"There has been a great deal of criticism, some totally anti-Christian bigoted over this movie, on that I find it to be for the most part unwarranted. Yes, there is a lot of blood to be seen in this film, but in real terms only three people who die in this film, one Jesus, and two bit characters (who were also crucified at the end), on scale of ""viewed deaths"" that makes this movie rather uneventful when it comes to true body count and gore.  Gladiator had thousands of deaths depicted, several in quite graphic detail including dismemberment and decapitations, this movie doesn't go to that extreme, and scant few complained about the ""violence"" or ""gore"" in Gladiator.  Schindler's List depicted the deaths of hundreds if not thousands in a truly vile almost industrial manner, again it not only was not attacked for it's violence, but praised, only for Mel Gibson's Jesus movie do the critics get angry and suddenly out of nowhere find their pacifism? That reveals a shameful hypocrisy and bias in the movie review and editorial community.  Jews might not be very happy with the portrayal of their ancient ancestors in this film, then again it wasn't Judaism's finest hour in any sense of the word, so to rewrite the bible story to appease the contemporary sensibilities of Jews would be inappropriate and `sticking to the story' was the intention of Mr. Gibson, all the warts and inconvenient features will be exposed.  This movie is indeed powerful, it hits you hard, you do need to be familiar with the story to understand ""why"" much of this is happening so some pre-viewing research might be necessary for non-Christian folks, but other than that it's an excellent film, it definitely ""should"" get a great deal of Oscar attention, but naturally that might not be so at all given how Hollywood and the ever-shallow media/entertainment industry talking-heads ruthlessly attacked, and one could say rhetorically crucified Mel Gibson over this film.  The box-office totals might change Hollywood's view on this though, this film will sell big, perhaps by box-office alone it'll get more ""respect"" by those in the industry, but not until then.  Do not send kids under say 13 or 14 or so to see this, and by no means anyone under 10 or so, but most teenagers should be able to handle the intensity of it, and comprehend it adequately, presuming they know the story.  The acting was fabulous, the hearing of Aramaic and old-Latin was interesting, the set and location shots were dead on perfect for the film; there were no weak points to it, and length wise it was about as long as the audience emotional endurance would permit. I'd score it a 9 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
1489,ServusChristi@aol.com,One of the best of all time,10,9 March 2004,"As a devout Catholic, I was deeply touched and moved, as the movie reminded me of the sacrifice made for me and all of humanity by our Savior. I left feeling emotionally drained, having watched one of the most powerful and moving films I have ever seen. Gibson did a fantastic job with the movie, and I found it to be very powerful in expressing both the divinity and humanity of Christ. Gibson rightly believed in this movie all along - it continues to do very well, and I think there's a large segment of the population that was waiting to see something like this. I was especially impressed with the scenes involving Mary and the intense suffering that she experienced too, seeing her Son suffer. I hope that this is considered for an Oscar nod for Best Picture next year - no matter what one's theology, it is a very well directed movie. I think it would have been easy to have taken many liberties, but I found it to be very true to the Gospels, though the Christology from the Gospel of John seems to particularly stand out.",The Passion of the Christ
1490,hellbodhisattva,Worth seeing for the cinematography,9,22 February 2007,"Caleb Deschanel, who did the cinematography does amazing work on this movie. It is worth seeing for his work alone, especially in the first scene where Jesus is in the garden just before Judas betrays him with a kiss. Mel Gibson's directing is also very good, maybe not quite as good as in Braveheart, but still, anything Mel Gibson directs is worth seeing if you're someone who studies and is interested in directing. I'm not a Christian but I thought the movie was interesting, compelling, and well made. I can't compare it to other movies about the life of Christ because I haven't seen any of them yet; but this is probably going to set the standard for a long time. The performances are good also, especially Jim Caviezel's. Too bad Monica Bellucci didn't have a larger role, she's quite an actress. Despite the fact that much had been made of it's supposedly anti-semitic undertones, a sentiment that was only reinforced by Mel Gibson's drunken anti-semitic rant, the first time I saw it was after Mel's drunken arrest and I looked with a critical eye and didn't come to the same conclusion, I don't think the movie has anti-semitic undertones. In conclusion, it's worth seeing if you don't mind gruesome violence, and if you like movies with good directing and cinematography.",The Passion of the Christ
1491,milen_kit,A true spiritual experience,10,1 March 2007,"In my opinion everyone who don't like the movie and is having a hard time to bare the graphic violence don't really hate the movie they just don't want to understand it , don't want to be involved in the deep massage that the movie gave us. The gore , the extreme violence helps the movie to be more realistic and more accurate to the story. The deepness of the feelings and emotions in the movie are like in no other movie . Those people who WISH TO UNDERSTAND the meaning of this great movie will open there hearts for the faith in GOD in the things that are most important than everything in our lives love , hope and forgiven.",The Passion of the Christ
1492,daptekar,Most Violent Movie Ever,2,2 January 2009,I think this movie was in the wrong category. This movie was more violent then Lethal Weapon or Braveheart put together. I've seen horror movies that didn't affect me the way this movie did. The day I saw it They dragged a lady out on a stretcher. I can't recommend this movies as a must see but many people feel that it is the true story. A movie can only be true to someone if he or she chooses to believe it is true. There are many biblical facts and fictions it is up to you to determine what is true and what is not. To me its just another biblical tale that was way too dramatic and violent for me personally.They should use the money they made from this movie to end homelessness in America I sure hope that there is not a sequel to this movie I will not be in line for it. What is it about biblical stories? Do people actually believe its the all mighty truth?,The Passion of the Christ
1493,alan_stocke,"Sobering, yet wonderful!",10,25 February 2004,"This is not a 'movie' in the normal definition that we are used to.  This is an experience.  What words can one find to describe their 'opinion' of this movie?  Yes, I guess from a technical standpoint you could go into a whole discussion of the casting, or the cinematography, or even the acting itself. But, you will still be left with the more important subject of...what do I personally do with this man Jesus and what He did for me?  All I can say after seeing it is 'thanks'.  Thanks to Mel Gibson for producing such a masterpiece at such a crucial time in our history, thanks to all of the people who are currently seeing the movie, but most of all thanks to the man who paid for my sin with His life...thank you Jesus.",The Passion of the Christ
1494,orkybash,"A noble, but flawed attempt",6,7 March 2004,"Mel Gibson's ""Passion"" may be a beautiful piece of filmmaking, but when it comes to tell the story of Jesus's death, it fails on a fundamental level. The movie needs to pre-suppose knowledge of not only the Gospel (or else the viewer is left wondering who all these people to whom we are not formally introduced are), but also of Christian doctrine.  The plot for this movie consists of one major event: someone dies.  At it's core, that's all it is. Now, as a catholic, I know that yes, it was the Son of God, and He died for our sins.But where in the movie does this come out?  To someone who is seeing this movie with no pre-knowledge, the movie is about someone's death.  We are not given any reason to care at all for this person who dies.  For all the audience knows, Jesus was a true criminal and deserved everything that He got!  We only see His past work in flashbacks, and there, too, we are not given enough context to care about what is going on.Also, the movie's emotional impact also stems from whatever pre-knowledge that the viewer has.  Gibson relies on the shock value of the bloody imagry to elicit an emotional response from the audience, but again, such a response is dependant on being able to think that ""Jesus did it all for me!"" Sadly, any well-acted passion play should be able to get this same response, so most of the blood seems wholly gratuitous.
I will concede that the movie is beautifully put together.  Taken frame by frame, the cinematography is some of the best that I have ever seen - unfortunately, the constant use of slow motion is distracting enough to detract from that.  The soundtrack is beautiful as well, both haunting and reverential.In all, it seems to me like this film would have been much more successful if it were the second act of some larger biblical epic.  On it's own, however, the film has nothing to stand on save for the viewer's past experience with Christianity.  Devout Christians will doubtlessly come out of this proclaiming it to be the most powerful and heart-wrenching telling of the Passion that they have seen.  They will probably not realize that all the power in this film comes from their experience, not Gibson's filmmaking.",The Passion of the Christ
1495,emma_frost13,An OK thriller,1,25 September 2009,"As a movie, it was played OK, but it was too emotional.As a thriller, it's violent scenes are not bad to watch.As a 'religious' movie, it has no spirituality and it only gives a stupid sense of guilt to those who actually believe it.It is brutal and has become antisemitism and a bit cult like, which even more so lowers it's credibility.As it is based on a medieval play which forced people into Christianity, I would say you should only see it as any other movie, and not some kind of reinforcement to believe in the bible.........",The Passion of the Christ
1496,jessepup27,"Regarding the ""unnecessary gore""",10,16 April 2010,"I do not believe it was unnecessarily gory, Jesus was actually unrecognizable when he was on His way to Galgotha, so they tempered back what actually happened. I am not asking everyone to believe, but if you truly know the event and believe that the event actually happened, then you know that is was brutal beyond belief. This is what He had to go through to save the WHOLE world from their sins. I wish there were more of these movie made so that ""we"" could see just what God and Jesus gave up for us. How He SO loved us. As for historically incorrect, who really knows the answer to that, except God, because I am pretty sure that no one living today was there.",The Passion of the Christ
1497,cwalter-1,Brutal portrayal shows the love of Christ!,10,26 February 2004,"It is difficult to understand the brutality of this film on solely human terms. A deeper understanding of Christ's purpose on earth is necessary. The violence is not presented for violence's sake, but to demonstrate the perfect, ultimate sacrifice Jesus gave for his Father's creation. The film forces you to recognize the sheer hell Christ freely endured for the salvation of mankind. The Bible is not a fairy tale. Gibson does not whitewash Christ's agony as some have done in the past. His film is visceral and upon reflection it is impossible to believe it could have been any other way. Some may complain that the savagery leaves little room for compassion and love. I respectfully disagree. The characters are developed in very human terms and its through their agony that there is compassion, spirituality and love.As for who killed Jesus, it is clear to me that it was the awful sin of humanity, to which I have contributed greatly. The film does not suggest otherwise.",The Passion of the Christ
1498,schlaflos,ASS! One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life!,1,16 September 2007,"To be honest, people are just writing good reviews about this movie because it's about Jesus Christ and stuff like that. People don't dare to write bad reviews about such topics.The truth about this movie? ASS! It sucks ass. I mean it! I would rather eat the rotten asshole of a road killed skunk and drown it with beer than EVER (E-V-E-R) watch this horrible movie again! Why? It's a typical Mel Gibson movie! Hell, what is wrong with MEL Gibson??? WHAT WAS HE THINKING?Let's see what this movie's about:At it's very first, it starts of with Jesus hiding in some forest. The devil's there, too. Oh, and hey: The devil is wearing a cowl and has no eye brows at all. Did you know that? Nevertheless, Jesus is being caught by all these Roman guys and finally judged to be punished.The punishment begins with whipping some sticks on his back, a few punches in his body and some great Mel Gibson Brave Heart kicks in his rips. It then continues with some Apocalypto whipping on his back. Didn't we have this have this before? Nope. Well yes, with sticks. Not with whips. If that wasn't enough his head get's some nice whips, too. Poor Jesus. If Mel Gibson wasn't so sick, Jesus wouldn't have suffered so much.Buf who was Jesus? What did he do in his younger years? Well, he was a carpenter. You should know that. Everything you'll get to see about Jesus' life in the movie is one scene, one tiny flashback, showing Jesus, his Mum and a nice table he made. But hey, f*** his life story. Booooooring. We wanna see him suffer. At least, Mel Gibson seems to like seeing people suffering.Let me think of other Gibson movies:Brave Heart: Brutal movie with lot's of punching, kicking and whipping. A lot of asses are kicked.Apocalypto: Brutal movie with lot's of punching, kicking and whipping. A lot of asses are kicked.The Passion of the Christ: Brutal movie with lot's of punching, kicking and whipping. One ass is kicked.Summary: Mel Gibson is one mental sick bad ass. He produces sick and crucial movies with little reference to reality. All his movies contain explicit violence and gore. Bullies will like his movies. The same idiots who bind there lives to the U.S. army later on.If you're just a bit reasonable at all, FORGO THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS! It isn't even worth RENTING IT FROM THE LOCAL VIDEO STORE FOR AN EURO OR AN U.S. DOLLAR OR SOMETHING!Spend your money on other things to enjoy a Friday night, condoms or something like that!",The Passion of the Christ
1499,BamBam_1,Powerful!! Inspiring!! Awesome!!,10,28 February 2004,"I've just seen Mel Gibson's `The Passion of Christ'. I wish I could Thank Mel Gibson personally for making such a powerful, moving, and inspiring film while being so true to the Bible. `The Passion of Christ' is movie that sincerely explores the phrase `Christ suffered for our sins'. We tend to sugarcoat the cruelty and brutality with which Christ willfully suffered. As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but to almost meditate on the fact that Christ suffered this intense cruelty and brutality for me. Salvation is very personal thing and yet everyone can be saved. That is the miracle. That is `The Passion of Christ'. Thank You Mel Gibson for having the courage and the determination to make this movie. I want to say the movie was beautiful but, of course, to say that watching Our Lord suffer such brutality is beautiful somehow seems inappropriate. The act, however, of one person laying down His life for all mankind is such beautiful gift, it is beyond words.
Once you watch the movie and meditate upon its content; the title seems so appropriate. `The Passion of Christ'. What kind of passion must Our Lord have for us that he would endure such unimaginable brutality and suffering? The Bible tells us that Jesus said; `Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.'(John 15:13) That verse sums up this movie perfectly. But Jesus didn't just lay down His life for us, Christ suffered for our sins.The movie itself is very skillfully done. When the brutality and suffering is almost more than the viewer can bare, Mel Gibson skillfully takes the viewer to a different place. Yet the point is made, better than any movie I have ever seen, that Christ suffered. And he suffered in every way possible; he suffered physically, mentally, and spiritually; all at the same time! And yet, at the height of his suffering; He Loves. He Loves us so much He prays for us. WOW! When you absorb the extent to which Christ suffered, the duration of His suffering, and combine those facts with His immense Love for those who were the instrument of His suffering; it is unimaginable that anyone would be capable of such Love! Thank God our Lord is.I heard a great deal of talk about this movie being Anti-Semitic. I didn't see that. I felt the movie made the point that we are all responsible for the suffering of Christ. We must keep in mind that there weren't any Christians around until Christ walked the Earth. Christian or Jew, we are all sinners.  Sin has a price. And Christ paid the ultimate price once and for all; for me, for you, for ALL!As the movie ended in the theatre I was in, the audience clapped as they cried and wiped their tears. But most surprising to me was that as I sat through every credit, I noticed as the lights came up; ¾ of the audience was there right along with me. After most movies, people leave the theatre as fast as they can exit. However, after viewing `The Passion'; I think one is almost compelled to take a moment and absorb it all.`The Passion of Christ' is more than just another movie. It is an experience. As Christians, it's an intimate look within our collective soul. And I can't help thinking about the controversy as to whether or not the Pope said `It is as it was'. All I can say is that if the Pope watched this movie and he didn't say that, he should have. While watching this movie, it seemed clear to me that Mel Gibson had help with this movie, help from One who was actually there at the original timing of this event.I can't wait for Mel to make the Prequel!!",The Passion of the Christ
1500,ttucker,A Must See For Everyone,10,27 February 2004,"You watch with a mixture of shock and joy. You cannot move. You can only sit motionless. In my entire life I have never felt such intensity. I can see Him now, and will never take communion in the same way as the imagery flows; of the body broken for me and the blood shed on my behalf. If a movie is what you watch on a screen, this is no movie. You have been to Calvary. You watched as Jesus was tortured and died, for you. You will never again wonder if God loves you. You will know!",The Passion of the Christ
1501,robinandreae,Oh Jesus!,1,29 May 2007,"I just recently endured this horrible film a couple of nights ago at the behest of a recently converted Christian friend. When this film came out I read the reviews and decided that I did not need to watch a film version of Christ's suffering. I am not one for blood lust. I found myself closing my eyes and uttering ""Oh Jesus"" about every three seconds in this film. I guess this is how it converts you to Christianity. The parts I did see bore very little resemblance to the biblical or historical accounts of Jesus' crucifixion that I had encountered. I tend to read several sources to get my information and then draw my conclusions. It's obvious that Mel Gibson has just one, the visions of Catholic mystic Anne-Catherine Emmerich. As to the film being anti-Semitic, I believe it can be interpreted as such from the omission of the historical and biblical background of the events that lead up to Christ's Crucifixion. It is my understanding from the writings of Josephus, a Jewish historian, Jesus Barabas was a political prisoner, a Zealot murder and a rioter, not a ravaged psychopath as portrayed in the movie. Caiphus was Sadducee high priest. The Sadducees were from the temple of Herod's. Herod was not of Jewish royal lineage. He was installed in the position of King of the Jews by the Romans. Certainly Caiphus would want Jesus dead as would Herod and the Romans. And of course no one would want to take responsibility for killing a popular figure who could claim noble lineage. The zealots weren't too keen on Jesus either; he didn't promote the violent overthrow of Herod or the Roman occupiers. Instead he preached of turning the other cheek and paying to Caesar what is Caesar's. There were literally thousands of crucifixions every year, mostly for crimes against Rome. Jesus' only crimes were blasphemy and not adhering to the Sabbath. For that he could be stoned to death if Caiphus wanted him punished. But he was a threat greater than any other blasphemer or Zealot who thought overthrow Roman rule and must held accountable as such. It wasn't the ""Jews"" who wanted Jesus dead. It was the political hierarchy. This or any other view is missing from this snuff flick. I call it a snuff flick because it's just about Christ's death and not about the person or the history or the biblical account. In all heart I couldn't recommend this film. I sorely disappointed my born again friend when I told her what I thought.",The Passion of the Christ

Ten lines..........OK I guess I'll start off by saying that not only did this movie suck, but, just like the South Park episode, it was a 2 hour snuff film. I did make a decent music video out of the torture scenes set to the song Personal Jesus. I guess that's all it was good for. I'm pretty sure that Gibson is a Nazi sympathizer. He probably has a portrait of Hitler on his ass or something. I know I'm gonna be ripped on this review, but I really don't have too much to say about it other than it was a horrible, horrible movie and it should have been dumped in the New Mexico with the copies of ET for the Atari 2600 and the special edition of Soul Plane(which was a better movie by far than this piece of crap).

I have never been in a fully-packed theater where no one got up for popcorn. No one giggled or carried on conversations. I don't recall even hearing any coughs. When it was over, most sat without moving for a couple of minutes. That is the power of this experience. The theater eventually emptied, in silence. Somewhere around 350-400 people in silence.

Never, I say NEVER has there been a movie more PASSIONATE, more REALISTIC, and more MOVING in the history of Hollywood or any other...THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM in the WORLD unfolding right before our very eyes...God bless MEL GIBSON, our modern day Prophet and thank God for giving him a 2ND LIFE!!!  I call on all the bigwigs of Hollywood: Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone, Peter Jackson, Francis Ford Coppola to watch & humbly appreciate this film 'cause this ain't NO Fantasy, Fiction, or even a Conspiracy; but rather, THIS IS THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD!...and THIS IS REAL!!!",The Passion of the Christ

How many times can Jesus get back up after another illegal move by Satan goes unpunished? Can he draw on the power of his hulkamaniacs...oops sorry I meant followers to carry out his final act on earth?In fact that would be an insult to wrestling fans, as this film makes the WWE look like a master class in subtlety and story telling.The acting was appalling and the female characters simpering grief made me wince and bite my lip to prevent me laughing.I seriously question the mind set of anyone (Christian or otherwise) who was moved emotionally by this bloated pompous vanity project.I only hope the next time I go to the cinema I have my faith in film making restored.",The Passion of the Christ

I have studied the bible, countless history books, visited libraries and museums around the world and I have yet to see anything close to verifiable evidence that Jesus ever lived.

About this film, Yes, it is violent. Yes, it is almost pornographic in its violence. Yes, it shows a man being physically attacked beyond the scope of reason.

1511,ExpiredCereal827,The most heartfelt movie I have ever seen,10,1 March 2004,"So painful to watch, yet I keep wanting to watch it over and over...The Passion of the Christ is the most powerful film ever made IMO. Who would have ever thought that one of the most hyped-up and talked about films for the past 30 years would be a movie about Jesus Christ?
The movie grabbed my attention from start to finish and it truly took my breath away. I'm not a religious person, and I have never been so moved by any movie ever. (On a side note, I hate it when people say I'm atheist when I tell them I have no religion. Just because I have no religion doesn't mean I can't believe in God.)I have never cried in a movie and I was so close to crying in this one. If the film doesn't affect you in any way, then you truly are cold-hearted. The cast gave excellent performances and I thought Jim Caviezel was superb in his role as Jesus. The direction is very unique as it has a style of it's own and Mel Gibson doesn't bring any of his baggage to this film. The cinematography is pure art and it gives a very visceral feel to it.Although this movie is one of the most violent movies I have ever seen, it brings a very poignant and powerful message. Don't let your kids watch it as the film brings over-the-top relentless brutality.Powerful, riveting, touching, heartfelt, inspiring, shocking, brilliant, and simply a masterpiece...The Passion of the Christ gets a perfect score from me.10/10",The Passion of the Christ

We have some quickcut shots of the transformations between children and wizened old men, again using terrible CGI.I havn't mentioned Exorcist baby. The brilliant scene in which Satan is floating around the Romans as they scourge Jesus is tarnsihed by the baby the Devil is holding. Mocking the Madonna and Child, it turns around slowly, exposing an evil smile, making me instantly think of Don't Look Now.And the end, wow.

Being a devoted Christian and a filmmaker, I couldn't resist, and saw the film the very first day it was shown in Salt Lake City.  The film is an incredible depiction of Lords love, his will, and his ultimate sacrifice. Yes, indeed it is violent and bloody, but you must ask the fundamental question how can a crucifixion be portrayed non-violently? Brilliantly performed, directed and photographed.  I highly recommend this film to all the `believers' as well as to the unbelievers and especially to all the filmmakers.

1514,clifgriffin,The Reviews are Wrong,8,25 February 2004,"Critics are ripping The Passion of the Christ as a sadomasochistic (the word Newsweek used) bloodbath. Relentlessly violent, they say.
Having walked from the theater 30 minutes ago I'm here to give me view.
The Passion is a violent film. Viewers are offered realistic portrayals of human barbarism at its ""finest"". The beatings are realistic. The wounds look authentic. The suffering is intensely truthful.I stared at a body broken, ripped by a ""cat of nine tails"", beat with fists, torn by thorns. I'll never see a more accurate portrayal of this very real event, but in my heart I could not understand what I was seeing. I could not comprehend the great suffering being played out on the screen. I searched my heart but I could not even find a place to begin. What does it feel like to have one's flesh so mutilated? Can any of us, sitting in suburbia in an air conditioned room with comfortable clothing really relate to that?I could not.The room was filled with tears. I didn't cry throughout the movie. I pondered what I was seeing. No one said a word. The viewers weren't chatting with their neighbors or looking around the room.At one point I did succumb to a tear or two, the image on the screen is truly powerful...however hard to relate to from comfortable ""here"".
Life changing? I don't know. My life was already changed by the cross. I think seeing what I believed in played out on the screen was therapeutic. Too long have people bought cross necklaces, put up little statues and trinkets, and cut out crosses from construction paper.
I'm reminded of the words from the song Here I Am to Worship ""I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross.""Perhaps not, but I feel a little closer.Don't go to this movie expecting your life to be changed. It is just a movie. I think we have a tendency to place undo significance on books, songs, and movies and lose sight of where the power of change comes from. It isn't from Mel Gibson or his movie. It isn't even from the physical printed pages of the Bible.It's from the source of the Bible and the ""author and finisher"" of our faith. It's from the one who was ""wounded for our transgressions"".I encourage you to see the movie. The world needs to experience a harsh, shocking picture of a harsh, shocking event.Clif   Blogzine.net",The Passion of the Christ

The visuals are impressive, not for the feint of heart, unless you are open to the *truth* This is probbly what happened, it sounds/looks/feels like it.

1516,jimmyjones1,Amazing,10,10 February 2008,"This movie was made to inform people about the suffering Jesus Christ went through, not to horrify or please those who are entertained by violence.As a Christian, I was incredibly moved by the film, and after watching it, wondered why people still continue to ruthlessly satirize and ridicule Christ and His followers. That would be even worse than making fun of a Nazi death-camp survivor or a paraplegic. Its pathetic that people so shamelessly criticize this movie for its ""political incorrectness."" This movie isn't much more graphic than one of the greatest films ever made, ""Schindler's List.""I truly admire Mel Gibson for the fact that he is one of the few, if not only, devoutly Christian directors in the modern world. He possesses an incredible amount of talent. Jim Caviezel is a truly underrated actor as well.For those who found this movie too violent for their tastes, I suggest ""Jesus Christ Superstar.""",The Passion of the Christ
1517,schpydah,Christ takes a licking and keeps on ticking,1,19 March 2004,"The answer to the timeless philosophical question, ""Can Hollywood produce an R-rated movie that my mother would go see?"" the answer is affirmative.
That's one of the very few positive things one can take from ""The Passion of the Christ,"" the cinematic meat-grinder by Mel Gibson. If you are not a Christian or are unfamiliar with the details of the last day of Christ, this movie will be a complete waste of time, unless you are into S&M porn and snuff films. My fundamentalist family saw it and, while not enjoying it exactly (and really, how could anyone, with the exception of the aforementioned genre of aficionados), was moved by it, in terms of experiencing the severity of Christ's torture for redemption of man's sin nature. My family is the target group for this film. It is a fundamentalist, black and white project, the Bible come to life with lots and lots of blood. There are no subtleties, no issues explored. Just brute violence. If that was the goal, then there's no better person than Gibson, whose career calling card is vicious bloodbaths (Mad Max, the Lethal Weapon movies, Braveheart, etc.) - ironically, the sort of movie that move the conservative types that have been flocking to this flick to declaim about the morally corrosive power of Hollywood.As a recovering Christian who is still haunted by and fascinated with Jesus, the idea of depicting the sadistic treatment of his death realistically appealed to me. Too often Christianity is presented in sanitary, fluffy terms, which ultimately feel out of touch at best and dishonest at worst. Gibson remedied this and then some. To watch this film is to explore how sadistic one's voyeuristic impulses are. There's a point up to which ultraviolence is shocking, then thereafter merely becomes mind numbing and the effect becomes diluted. Basically, after seeing Jesus get shredded into corn beef during an unrelenting 10 minute scourging scene, which includes a scene where the hooks of a flogger embed into Jesus' flank, then rip out his flesh exposing his ribs, it turns into porn. Gibson goes too far. While it's clear that it's important for him to depict the suffering of Christ, his excessiveness invokes the law of diminishing returns, and it damages the movie. The thematic scene of the movie occurs when we see soldiers driving the nail into Jesus' feet, seen from his point of view. With a gasping anguished cry, he says ""Father, forgive them. They know not what they do."" This should've been a powerful scene, the money shot, overwhelming the viewer with Christ's unconditional love of these sadistic thugs (and ultimately us). Instead, you have been rendered numb with the bloody tedium of the prior hour by this point. With nothing to distract you from this butchery, or, if you're not a believer, not seeing why Christ subjected himself to this, you end up not really caring and wondering why this film was made. If Gibson made this film as method of proselytizing, it fails; devotion of one to his own dogma under the most excruciating circumstances does not lend validity to the truthfulness of those beliefs. Since so little of the film focuses on Jesus' actual teachings, we're left with this horrible appeal to emotionalism. In the end, I don't really understand why Gibson felt the need to make this particular movie.In the hands of a more gifted director, this movie could've been shocking and still moving, regardless of your spiritual inclination. Case in point: at the end of the grueling scourging scene, there is a shot of the courtyard in which it took place. There is an arc (or a halo, if you will) of splattered blood around the block Jesus was lashed to. The camera moves in closer to examine the little pools of blood forming, then Mary and Magdalene, in a trance and on all fours ineffectually moping it up with towels. This scene would've been more powerful if the scourging scene was cut down to maybe 3 minutes, then the camera pans away with the sound of Jesus screaming and the whips lashing, then Mary has a flashback, and then come to the scene of the ring of blood. Brutality mixed with horrible beauty. With Gibson you just get brutality.Gibson also makes a very strange choice in a non-biblical scene he added. After one of the thieves that was crucified with Christ berates him for not leaving the cross (which is biblical), a raven alights on his cross and tries to pluck out his eyes. What was the point of this scene? It smacks of retribution to me; nature's way of bitch-slapping the thief for talking smack about the Lord. That's kind of contrary to the reason why the Lord was up there bleeding on the tree, yes?If you want a thoughtful and emotional take on the whole Jesus business, I highly recommend ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" by Nikos Kanzantzakis (the movie is only mediocre). This book is the one piece of art that made the human aspect of Jesus real to me. It also illustrates the importance of mythology in spiritual systems.In Gibson's defense, if this film is anti-Semitic, then the Bible is anti-Semitic. Not all Jews depicted in the movie want to crucify Jesus; just the Pharisees and those who also thought Christ was a heretic.
The final scene of Christ rising from the tomb will probably be inspirational for believers, but all it did for me was raise questions. Specifically, why were all the welts completely healed and gone, but the holes in the hands remained? I chalk it up to the unknown properties of zombie generation.This is an extremely subjective movie for true believers by a true believer, and while beautifully shot and well-designed, is a ridiculous steaming bowl of blow slaw.",The Passion of the Christ
1518,SpiritWeaver-1,"An excellent, moving film",10,2 March 2008,"Yes, the movie is very bloody and yes there are scenes of extreme violence BUT it gives an accurate portrayal of what happened to Jesus. While there may have been some aspects added purely for creativity, the film was still very good and it helped me to understand what Jesus really went through. Some people are saying how this movie is too bloody and that there is no way this credible. But do you honestly think that the whipping and scourging lasted only a few seconds and that there was only a few drops of blood. This film shows what Christ went through for you. And this film is not anti-Roman or anti-Semitic.It's the truth. Read the Gospels. The acting was also excellent. You hear only Aramaic/ Street Latin but there are subtitles. It gives the film a middle-astern feel and the angles and scenes were very well designed and thought out. There are some very emotional flashbacks that will really get to your heart. (However they may be lost on someone who does not know what happens in the Gospels prior to the time this took place.) If you can't handle violence, though, then this movie is not for you. I remember having to look away from the screen a coupe of times, especially when they beat him with the cat-of-nine-tails. But if you do see it, it will change the way you view what Christ did for us and show you how great His love for us truly was.",The Passion of the Christ
1519,sanerjee,"horrifying experience, a torture for the audience",1,28 February 2004,"I am not really sure what Mr. Gibson wanted to potray. I am certain he had a vision in mind though I could not understand what exactly it was. I would not like to comment on the material (I take it as a story) simply because I do not have adequate knowledge in the subject matter. A person like me who has no background knowledge in the subject would be totally lost from the beginning. Mr. Gibson did not even put in an honest effort in potraying any character. Characters came and went, and I stayed confused forever. Even the central character is vaguely depicted in a mixture of  disconnected events heavily punctuated by violence so bloody that only a mentally sick person would be able to keep their eyes open.To me Mr. Gibson concentrated on the potrayal of the suffering of a person who was tortured to death by roman soldiers on the request of some priest-like shady characters (there were so many of them) who is refferred to as jew priests. There are two important questions in my mind. Why and how did the roman soldiers derive so much pleasure from the torture when their general was so compassionate about the person? The second thing is why did such a non-violent man who without a word of protest sacrificed himself in the alter of humanity, kill a viper by smashing it under his feet with unbridled spite. That scene stayed with me troughout the movie and really I could not make sense of the contradiction.",The Passion of the Christ
1520,hbk500,Stunning Portrayal of the Last Twelve Hours of Jesus,10,25 February 2004,"Never did I leave a theater so stunned as I did when leaving ""The Passion of the Christ"" earlier tonight. It is a film which is so violent and cruel but yet so very loving and heartwarming.The story need not be addressed too much. Jesus Christ is betrayed by a disciple, tried before the High Priests and the Romans, scourged, condemned to death, crucified, dies, but is resurrected 3 days later. It is a story known to most for the past 2000 years, but never has the Passion of Christ been shown as gut-wrenching yet beautiful as it has been in this movie.The acting is top notch as was expected. Jim Caviezel portrays Jesus miraculously as the Messiah who is literally beaten to death for giving a message of love and forgiveness, and for proclaiming himself the son of God. The way he can act even being covered in blood, cuts, and bruises just boggles the mind. No other film Jesus has given as passionate a performance as Caviezel did here.Maia Morgenstern is wonderful as heartbroken Mother Mary who must watch her son be killed.  Monica Bellucci is equally as impressive as Mary Magdalene, the repentant prostitute who weeps with Mary at the death of her savior. Hristo Shopov gives Pontius Pilate the cold and uncaring performance he deserves. Rosalinda Celentano shows true evil as the inhuman Satan who tries to tempt all that is good.Absolutely fantastic cinematography and direction in this film. The teardrop from heaven after Jesus died almost made me form a teardrop of my own. The scourging and crucifixion are just horrible to watch, as they should be, for they were not pretty things in Roman times. Really lovely score by Debney as well, sets the mood for the whole story.My only main complaint about this film was the making of Caiphas as an antagonist. It seems Jesus didn't have one clear enemy figure in the Bible, which was for a reason. There wasn't a single enemy, as the enemy of Jesus was the evil that is inherent in every human being, an evil which can only be destroyed by love and forgiveness. Not a major deal, but I would have preferred Caiphas to be closer to the Biblical version. I was also upset that Nicodemus wasn't given any screen time at all, for he all but disproves the notions of anti-semitism.As for the violence, well, this film isn't for 5 years olds. I would say that 10 (more towards 12) would be the earliest age for a child to see the film. However, it really depends on the maturity and sensitivity of the child. The violence here is quite graphic, but it enhances the story in a way that any mature child/teen would understand.Anti-semitism is not an issue here in the least if you can realize that we are all responsible for the death of Christ, not just the High Priests or the Romans. However, Christ had to die to save mankind from its past sins. That is what Gibson conveys in the film, not anti-semitism or pro-violence or anything of the sort.Don't come to this film expecting ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" or especially ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" This is a conservative Catholic film detailing a traditional view of the death of Christ, a view which may seem controversial to some, but really is one of the most beautiful love stories ever told.",The Passion of the Christ

It may not be everyone's view of christianity or religion or philosophy, but it was true to what I was taught to contemplate in retreats and in passion week. The reviews said there is no theology in the film. It had the only important message, love your enemy. It did not show the Jewish people as responsible for the death; it did blame politics and power brokers and men afraid for their people under occupation. It reminded me strongly of the riots and crowds in Iraq being manipulated. It also made quite clear, by showing that the crowd in the forum was a hired mob, and the crowds on the via dolorosa helping him ,that the Jewish people were not being blamed. Some members and leaders of the catholic and christian churches have been much to blame for anti-semitism over the centuries, but I do not believe this film gives any cause for fear.",The Passion of the Christ

Mel Gibson does an amazing job, and even though he has been persecuted, this film will go down as one of the greatest movies of all time. I guarantee it. This is a movie about faith, not entertainment. As a Christian, I have seen many films showing the torture and crucifixion of Jesus Christ. This film easily blows away all of them combined. A great job was done showing the scourging and crucifixion, Mel wanted these two things to shock people and they deliver. Big time. I was also pleased to see that Gibson showed Christ coming back to life, the main fact that we have hope as Christians. Kudos on the scenes with Judas Iscariot and the Aramaic with subtitles.

1523,gurudass,A Brave Heart Indeed/A Story of Humanity as a Whole,10,26 February 2004,"Stirring, moving, brutal: a lot of what has been said about this movie is true. A lot, not all. It is relentlessly brutal, yes, but in being so, it succeeds in making you EXPERIENCE within your own being the suffering of Jesus and therefore take in the measure of his loving sacrifice. A sacrifice he consented to so that we,humanity, would have the opportunity to open our hearts and consciousness. One thing the movie is NOT, thank God, is anti-Semitic. On the contrary, the  power of the movie stems from its universality: the o so human corruption amongst men ""of power"", the o so human relentless brutality towards the ostracized, those who dare to be or think different. It is not the Jews who killed Jesus (this has always seemed such an un-enlightened - not to say plain stupid - statement to me anyway) it is human fear, human greed, human lust for power, human corruption among those invested with responsibilities towards their citizens/parishioners etc., responsibilities which they mis-construe as power. Like most people in the theater last night, I sobbed. Not because I am a Christian, or a Jew, or Italian, all or some of the above, but because I am part of this humanity which, out of fear, condemns and tortures those who threaten the foundations of its identification with whatever: monetary success, position in society, certain physical features, so-called morals etc. I sobbed during ""The Schindler's List"" for the same reason and I m(ay) not (be) German either. That this story took place among Jews and Romans is just Geography - not to mention History - the luck of the draw, so to speak.  But it is the story of humanity as a whole. The saddest thing is, all the controversy surrounding the movie and the outrageous statements that have been made about it and against Mel Gibson prove that, 2000 and some years later, humanity has not learned much, not evolved as much as we might like to think: Mel Gibson is a Brave Heart indeed!",The Passion of the Christ
1524,psychomek86,Great Film.,10,23 February 2004,"I've never written a review on imdb before but I thought today was a good day to do so. I have just gotten out of an advance screening of ""The Passion"" and loved it. It really seemed to show the true nature of Jesus and his death without being the 12 hour docu-crap that most Christian attempts at telling the story have been.First of all, the directing is superb as Mel proved once again his knowledge of movies. From the lighting and the sets, to the perfect mix of gruesome depictions of violence(there were many) and quiet moments of pain, they were all amazing.I also noticed how he was able to bring out such  strong emotional performances from each of his actors. Claudia Gerini was tremendous as Mary, the grieving mother of Jesus as she was tormented by the thought of her son having to go through so much pain, while at the same time subtly portraying her understanding of the necessity of his death. Monica Bellucci was also really good as the Mary Magdalen who owed Jesus a life debt and was one of only 3 followers of  Jesus (Mary the mother of Jesus and John the beloved disciple were the other two) that followed him all the way to the cross(At least the only 3 that they speak of in the Gospels). Which brings me to the best performance of the film, Jim Caviezel. He was absolutely awesome as Jesus Christ, the ""King of the Jews"". Through his portrayal Christ's torture and death, I believe he realistically depicted both the human and Godly aspects of The Christ. Further, his performance made me realize the reality of the pain He went through at His death.Although, I am quite biased (being a born-again Christian myself) I would truly recommend seeing this movie, at least to see what all the talk is about and to decide for yourself whether this is a good movie or not.",The Passion of the Christ
1525,themoonwatcher,"Nice try, but no cigar",6,29 February 2004,"""Passion"" is definitely one thing, and perhaps one thing alone: passionate. Mel's obsession with the gory last day of Christ supplies this film with enough energy to keep you in the theatre, but another, more important, question should be asked: Was the film enjoyable? Frankly, I did not think so.  Yes, it was interesting (on some levels). People have commented on the astonishing cinematography, but seriously, what movies don't have great cinematography today?  As far as the acting goes, I would consider it average.  Maybe above average in some areas. James Caviezel handled the role nicely, but I thought Maia Morgenstern was certainly more interesting than her son.  I expected more from Monica Bellucci, but ended up completely dissatisfied with her acting ability (or rather, her direction from Mel). The only thing that Mel does ""well"" is surprise the audience with all the blood and gore.  The focal point of the story is Jesus's physical torment.  However, this is not wholly satisfying.  Yes, I understand that some movies are not always ""entertaining"" and must instead be viewed as ""moral or ethical messages,"" but I question this notion because I am not sure if I would go back to see this movie - not because I am afraid of violence, but because it was not enjoyable to sit through.  There is an old movie adage that states that a good film should never be depressing, but I found this movie very depressing. I think the main reason the public has generally praised ""Passion"" is out of fear and confusion.  Who would really want to criticize such a controversial movie?  I also believe that people don't really know what they feel about the movie - God knows I didn't walking out of the theatre. People ""think"" it's a very good movie, and they'll vote on that alone. Mel Gibson is not a great director.  He's an interesting guy, he definitely has something to say, but film is not the medium for his message. He moves his viewers, but he does very little to entertain them, to make them enjoy the experience - which is what the movies are all about.",The Passion of the Christ

The trek to the cross is one overextended exercise is masochism.  Jesus' moral lessons are treated in overlit quickie flashbacks.  They're not even allowed to be played out as scenes, because Mel is too intent on relishing the torture to be distracted by anything Jesus might have taught to his disciples.  And that slo-mo!

1527,soulfood76,Hard to describe,10,25 February 2004,"Now that I've finally seen this film, I feel like I can join the throngs of those who comment on it.  Unfortunately, many of them did not do this movie the service of seeing it before their judgement.I have never given a movie a 10/10, and feel very tentative doing so.  I would not ordinarily, if for no other reason than principle, but in this case I must.  For a few reasons:1. The movie is beautiful.  Cinematography, colors, sounds, etc.  It looks terrific.2. It is compelling.  The events and dialogue that the writers ""supposed"" are appropriate, tasteful, and enlightening.  The direction is superb, as we feel we are truly there, witnessing a horrible event.  But within that framework, through a well-done use of flashbacks and side characters, we understand that Jesus willingly endured the beatings, scourgings, tauntings, and crucifixion.Anti-semitic?  Absolutely not.  There were more Jews shown opposed to this event than those who called for it, and the brutality came from the hands of the Romans.  Yes, the Jewish priests asked for it, but they were not the ones gleefully tearing pieces of flesh from Jesus' body, and they were not the ones mocking him, and placing the crown of thorns on his head.  So where are all the irate Italians condemning this film for being anti-Italian?Historically accurate?  Well, do you want to nit-pick?  First and foremost, it's a movie - storytelling.  Did Jesus have long hair?  Maybe not.  Did they speak Latin in the wrong scene?  Oops.  Did they hammer through the wrists instead of palms?  Maybe.  Was Jesus in a loincloth or naked on the cross?  Give me a break.  Anyone who cannot see past these small details sadly misses the point of the most powerful film I've ever seen.",The Passion of the Christ
1528,folksong,Where's the purpose of this movie?,1,27 February 2004,"There are many reasons I didn't like this, and, subsequently, rated it a 1. The first reason is this: movies NEED a purpose.  I've heard the mainstream answer, which is to ""SEE what happened to Jesus, not just read it.""  I've also heard that, for non-Christians (history buffs) it is to see Christ's Passion in a historically accurate presentation.  These don't mean you make ANOTHER movie (see Jesus of Nazareth) about Jesus, which brings NOTHING new to the scene, and brings nothing that can possibly intrigue non-Christian, non-history-buffs.  The purpose of this movie is NIL, other than what seems to be a drawn out Catholic/Anti-Semitist Propaganda film.A second reason is because it DID add one thing, and that was an overall shock-treatment to the passion, which is to say more unnecessary gore than any other film I've ever seen.A third, and final, reason for why this movie was horrible is because I walked out saying ""Those were some awesome special effects.""  I DO NOT EVER want to say that about a SERIOUS movie ever again.  The gore will force tens of thousands of people to praise The Passion of the Christ, it will convince everyone that it is worth anything, because of its cheap trick of blood and gore.",The Passion of the Christ
1529,n_hkat,snuff flick?,2,4 August 2006,"okay, the following things need to be kept in mind while reading this. for starters, i have only made it about seventy minutes through this movie so far. next, please read all of this before taking issue. also, i only checked it out because of the new Gibson scandal (and who says there's such a thing as bad press?). finally, i have no aversion to violence in film, so long as it serves a purpose.so let's open with the violence issue. this is pretty much an NC-17 level of graphic brutality ladled upon a human being (what did Caviezel do for an audition, hire a guy to beat the tar out of him for two hours while the casting director watched?). for as explicit as the torture is, the whole message of redemption and sacrifice is kind of kicked to the curb. sure, everyone knows the story, but that doesn't excuse the filmmakers from skipping straight to the gory bits. wouldn't it have been nice to see something more of this character before he is mercilessly scourged other than he had a premonition that some day folks would sit on chairs around high tables? that's a snarky miracle, at best. and maybe the writers threw that in there in an attempt at comic relief. if this were the case, the attempt is failed, as there is no hint at levity apparent anywhere else. long story short, if a guy's being torn apart on screen and i'm supposed to care, don't rest on the laurels of faith to get me interested in the character. if you want converts, make a compelling character portrait, not a whipping boy.moving on to the fact that so many people were offended by this movie, and not just the cine-literate public. there was a lot of press about this flick espousing anti-Semetic attitudes. i can see where that is coming from to a degree. sure, there were some Jewish people who petitioned to get this Jesus guy crucified (so the story goes). the movie also makes clear that there were some Jewish people who thought that the whole kangaroo court thing was a travesty and were forcibly ejected from the proceedings. so the movie didn't paint the rosiest portrait of the Jewish people. neither did the new testament in regards to the persecution of this guy. there are certain things about the whole Christian thing that can be taken as anti-Semetic by anyone within or outside the faith.while we're at it, how about the portrayal of the Romans? with the exception of Pilate's wife, they're either a bunch of sadistic thugs or self-serving politicians. and how about the kids? they're all demons, persecuting Judas. and what of the little people? antichrist. transgender folk? Satan. and by the way, was i the only one who noticed that nearly everyone in this movie is a shade or two from lily white? just a few notes on some aspect of the film itself, devoid of politics. i think that there is zero character development. the direction is two dimensional, as is the script. the cinematography is inappropriate, however the lighting is nice. costumes are kind of a no-brainer (we need 500 robes, STAT!). the small amount of CGI so far is conspicuous and poorly blended.so i think that in another three years, i might watch ""World Trade Center"" on my free on-demand so i can watch another bunch of hacks with more self-serving delusions of humanity try to capitalize on human suffering.",The Passion of the Christ
1530,itymari,Beautifully impressive,10,26 March 2004,The movie brought tears to my eyes.  Seeing this movie has inspired me to be better. The life and death of Jesus christ is a story a lot of us know. But just like it happens with history we hear these stories so often that we forget there real. Hearing them often gives them a surreal touch and alot of times we are not able to think and wonder how it must have felt being there or how impresive the story really is. How many times have we heard about Christopher Columbus and his many discoveries yet we are not impressed. But when you think hard of the place and time you can see and feel it's importance. The Pasion of The Christ did this to me. It took the veil off my eyes. It made me see Jesus more real than ever and I was shocked and ashamed of my own weakness in which so often I deal with life not so good situations. We crumble up easily and succumb to temptation to soon and we easily forget that there is a God and feel abandoned when He too suffered for us and stood strong even when he was scared. I feel that I could do anything with faith and I know my faith will be tested but I feel stronger knowing there is a God who loves me.,The Passion of the Christ

Not a single soul could leave the movie without being moved by the suffering of Jesus as was portrayed in the film.With regards to the accusations that this film is Anti-Semitic, if someone feels that way, I think he or she has a lot of soul searching to do. In my opinion, the film portrayed the Roman guards as the protagonists just as much as Caiphas, the high priest. So, if people find this film to be Anti-Semitic, isn't it just as possible, this film is Anti-Italian? The answer is it's not Anti-anything unless you go in their with a preconceived notion.

For that matter I can recall a few other detailed recounts of human torture which are more gory and happen to someone for much lesser reasons and were never considered holy by anyone. watching the film I couldn't help feeling that the perspective and reference of the theme with regards to violence vs. religion, bares an astonishing resemblance to the ones displayed by pagan cults or fanatics, such as those terrorists who behead people on the internet with reference to their whatever religion. I find Gibson's perspective very naive. everything is so good and bad, black and white. there's such a sad focus on shifting the blame and passing it around until it falls on the spot reserved by the creator. very much like a bad cartoon. very much like any religion sense making.",The Passion of the Christ
1533,stefandetrez,Thirteen reasons not to see the P of the C,3,15 May 2004,"I was not convinced in a positive sense by the movie. 1) Suppose this movie was not about Jesus, but a random fictional character. Wouldn't you be repulsed by the cruelty? Doesn't the fact that it's 'Jesus' being flagellated make a bad excuse for showing cruel behaviour? 2) A movie based on the Bible is bound to be historically inherently contradictory. Don't waste your time claiming that it's historic. 3) The side story based on the fantasies/visions of visionaries is undeveloped (the flashback, the cleaning of Jesus's blood -what's that good for?-). 4) Pilate's character is too meditative to claim that the movie is historical. 5) The carrying of the cross is too blown up to be convincing. Especially the slo-mo falls of Jesus give him something of a mock-heroic. 6) As far a Jesus's humanity goes, he never says 'Auch' or screams when he is being hurt. One would turn skeptic for fewer things. 7) The camera work, the editing and the sequencing etc are done well, but the credibility of the story (as both fictional or non-fictional)is full of gaps, unnecessary detail and unconvincing brutality. 8) Jacob's emotional involvement with his brother's death is as cold as an ice vendor's fridge. Jacob looks at his brother's fate as if he doesn't care one bit. 9) Maria Magdalena played by Monica Bellucci was a bad cast. 10) Jesus's mother becomes uglier throughout the movie. The evolution is almost funny. 11) The cracking sound of the thorned crown into Jesus's skull is silly. 12) Anyone being whipped the way 'Jesus' was in this movie is guaranteed to bleed to death. Yet Jesus didn't seem to have so much blood to spill. 13) The scene where Jesus talks to his disciples on the mountain is overlighted. You might not agree with all the reasons, some of them being detaillistic, but still, a movie about Jesus's last hours can be made with more integrity and 'convincingness', just by, for instance, not turning Jesus into a flat character.See this movie and then purge yourself from it.",The Passion of the Christ

Never did I think that the violence was there for violence's sake.  Never once do you cheer the violence, never once do you think, ""cool!  Blood!""

1538,mtownbaby,misses on both fronts,7,25 February 2004,"First, as a piece of film, I don't think this movie is a great success. Despite an amazing performance by James Caviezel as Jesus, and equally strong support in the roles of Mary and Magdalene, I was disappointed in the overall acting.  I felt like you could tell the director had intended for this movie to be released without subtitles, and with that in mind, had instructed the actors to exaggerate their performances. The graphic depictions of violence are then left to carry the film. Violence is enough to gross me out and turn me off, not to keep me involved in a movie.Second, as an evangelism, this movie is way off target. The sacrifice of Christ was given out of love.  I felt this movie focused on hate. It focused on the persecution and torture.  Mel Gibson wanted to present the pain and humiliation Jesus endured.  This comes across, and the strength of this message drowns out the more important message of love and forgiveness. Jesus was sacrificed on the cross so we wouldn't have to remember the pain of sin.

Not that this fact alone makes the film bad, but the repitition of this concept keeps the film from being great. People in theaters across the country aren't crying through this movie because Jesus died for our sins, they're cring because jesus just got lashed for the 27th time. It's almost too easy from a director's standpoint. All you have to do is show the primary religious figure of a few hundred million people getting punched in the face by jews and romans, and you have people crying all the way to the bank.

1540,guitom,"gory, gory, gory",7,11 April 2009,"After reading many of the comments printed on this site, I can't believe so many people are dumb enough to take the gospels literally. They weren't written down till 200 years after Christ's death, and then by people trying to start a new religion. There's a huge difference between ""having faith"", meaning believing in God and God's love, and actually swallowing the crap mankind has written about God, God's nature, or the events surrounding Christ's life and death. That having been said, I thought this movie was likely the best gore/torture movie ever made. I find it bloody unlikely that a human (and YES, Christ was human) could take most of what the movie portrayed and not die of shock and/or blood loss long before reaching Golgatha, so I saw much of the violence as purely gratuitous, exactly what you want in a good slasher movie. While watching Christ's delusions of grandeur and Judas' hallucinations of Satan and demons pushing him to kill himself, my sole impression was ""clearly there's something messing with these guys' brains, likely ergot poisoning or some similar natural food contaminant. Helluva way to go. Mel Gibson's impetus for making this film was clear to me. The movie relates two stories: 1) the extraordinary suffering of Christ and 2) the Jewish priesthood NEVER stopped pushing for his death.

The vivid detail that has been used to illustrate the physical agony in which Jesus suffers is again historically accurate to the intense pain and agony that a person would suffer on the cross, slowly being suffocated by one's own weight. I recommend that anyone over the age of 18 see this movie regardless of religious affiliation as it will give many individuals a ""new"" perspective of who the person of Jesus of Nazareth was. Under the age of 18 should be considered within the context that there are graphic images displayed that may not be acceptable to every viewer.

Jesus knew from the beginning that this day would come. In my account Mel Gibson did a terrific job portraying the beatings and the crucifying of our Lord Jesus Christ. this movie brought me into tears through out the whole film. so many emotions ran through me as i watched this film. as a believer in Christ it just hurts to see that i am not worthy of what he has done.

The only thing that Mel taught me was that he had an extraordinary high threshold for pain. I GET IT. I got it it after the first five minutes of beatings. I thought Gibson did a terrible job of telling us a story. If I had not read reviews or seen some of the furor, I would not have even known who some of the people in the movie were. Who was that guy with the two Mary's? John? Paul? Why did those men who called for Jesus to be crucified wield such power and influence over Ponches Pilot and the roman hierarchy? If Pilot was so hesitant to appease the mob, why then, would he allow such torture to be bestowed on Jesus? And Finally, The one question I could not get out of my mind, Would did Jesus do that was so bad? He seemed like a pretty good guy to me. If he really threatened the throne and the penance for blasphemy was so bad, tell me why! Give a little history from the era. You never assume the audience knows the story coming in. In this case, where an interpretation of a story is told, it should be even important to TELL US WHY this horrible stuff is happeningMel Gibson has done a great job of hyping this movie, but in the end he will be remembered for making a sloppy one.

Although there are things that could have been done differently about this film that could have improved it, for any so-called critic to pan it outright only displays their absolute bias toward the message of Christ, Mel Gibson, or both. Any honest critic would have to at least give credit for great directing, inventive story-telling, and cinematography.  This is a must see.  It probably is not appropriate for younger audiences.

At least until now.  The Passion of the Christ is no less than one of the greatest films ever made.  It fully realizes the vision of it's artist by bringing the ordinary to the forefront.  Jesus is one of us. Only those who the Father revealed Jesus to knew his divinity.  We would have missed his presence if he came today.  The Romans were who they were, rule from force and cruelty.  Power struggles are the same then as they are today.  We are not moving forward as a ""secular"" society but taking big steps backward.  Mr. Gibson presents the spirituality of suffering to a world today that refuses to see that there is true holiness to be found by first understanding that the God made man knew pain and torment on a level we never understood. By accepting what pain we cannot change in our own life and presenting it in union with his, we will be made whole.  The secular critics of this film baffle me when they object to the extreme suffering of Jesus.  Where is the basic question:  What kind of God would demand such a method of salvation?  Mel Gibson can't be blamed for the a choice made by the creator of the Universe.  The wise are made to look like fools in their comments.  Mary has never been more beautifully portrayed.  I was extremely moved to see how she became his motivation to finish the job when his humanity was about to fail in sheer physical weakness.  For Catholics, it was as if he would see her and remember that his sinless ""ark of the New Covenant"" was promised a savior that made her very existence as the new perfected Eve possible.

Imagine that you don't know the story behind the movie and that Jesus doesn't already have the emotional status as he has for the people in the western world. Then it is nothing more than a perverted sequence of ultra violence. Close up follow close up when the body is torn apart by whips and sticks. The movie has nothing, what so ever, concerning character development and if you didn't already know who Jesus was you could care less to watch this sick sequence of a man being brutally tortured. The story would be vastly confusing and it wouldn't make sense at all. So, if you want to see this disgusting violence scene make sure you know the story behind it.Watching it for what it was, a story about Jesus, it works. It is an extremely well directed long scene of violence towards Jesus. Every hit against his body is shown as well as the wound it makes. The big nails are hammered through his hands and his feet while you watch the nail go deeper for every hit. The movie has some good symbolism and a message hidden in the violence but it entirely drowns in blood and torn apart flesh. I give this move 3/10 and it earns all three points by the fact that it is very well made, visually that is. It is very genuinely done and the whole movie is spoken in Aramaic and Latin which is also a plus. I do not recommend this movie to anyone except people with a fetish for violence.

However, I found that my expectations were very different than what was shown, and I was initially quite disappointed.Not being Catholic, I was distracted by Mary's (his mother's) practically serene demeanor.  I was also surprised that the bit about cleaning his face with a cloth and having his facial image imprinted on it was in there.Reflecting on it the next day, I remembered that there is a Catholic observance called ""The Stations of the Cross"" in which they reflect and meditate on the 14 different stages of Jesus' passion, starting with the sentencing by Pilate and ending with his body being laid in the tomb (and including the Veronica face cloth bit).  It is an intense meditation on His suffering that day, and it would appear that the 14 stations are generally found as plaques in most Catholic churches.That's when I realized the movie was not intended to have a full Gospel presentation of the who and why of that day.  The assumption is that what happened before and after that day are well known, and that the exercise is focused intently just on the sufferings.I may go to see it again with this better in mind and focus on the sufferings, putting aside my frustrations that so much is left unexplained and that the resurrection is tacked on almost as an afterthought (note that the resurrection isn't one of the stations).",The Passion of the Christ

I understood that he died for our sins and this is no different than what I've learned in Catholic School.  In no way at all did I find this to be anti-semetic.  If the Jewish community finds this to be a problem, then it is their problem.  They are creating a spectacle, where there is no need to create one.  Come on, Joel Siegel, a jew, has seen the movie and says that it is definitely not anti-semetic.  We all know who killed Jesus.  The Roman soldiers took much in enjoyment and pleasure in torchering him, if they didn't, at the time, they were considered less then men.  It doesn't make me feel any better to know that they actually killed him.  I believe that Pontius Pilate left it in the hands of Caiphas, knowing fully that if Caiphas didn't handle this that there would be a grueling war amongst the Jews, which we know that Pontius Pilate had slaughter many Jews previous to the crusifixion.  To avoid this onslaughter and for Caiphas losing his place as the high priest, he recommended that Jesus be tortured and Barrabas be set free.  Exactly the way it was foretold in the movie, is exactly the way we learned in class. After seeing the movie, I don't believe the Jews were responsible for his death.  The most compelling and moving moments are when his mother, Mary, saw him being torturned.  Any mother who has a son must have been tormented while watching this.  The fact that it was done in a dead language (Aramaic) and Latin had made it all the more real and heart wrenching.  I came out of this movie wanting to know more in reading the Gospels and the Bible.  To understand and forgive the people around me and to realize that life is too short and the most important factor is to find peace within myself.

But what the Gospels describe is all there.This film is not anti-Semitic.  There are good Jews and bad.  In no way does it portray all Jews as responsible for Christ's death.

And with the Aramaic and Latin, and the closeness of the scenes, the viewer feels like a witness to the Passion, like you're right there as it happened. The only flaw is that those without a good knowledge of the story might not understand what this is all about. In other movies about Christ, such as ""Jesus of Nazareth"", that progress from the birth to the resurrection, one can better understand His mission and that His suffering had a purpose. Gibson's film starts in Gethsemane and throws you right into the heat of it all. Maybe those unfamiliar will read the Scriptures to find out the rest.The biggest concern is the violence.  Yes, this is tough to watch.  I turned my head.  I closed my eyes.  I cried.  And this is definitely not for children.  There is no way to sugar coat a scourging and crucifixion, but where other films about Christ would cut away, Gibson shows it.  His goal was to show ""the enormity of that sacrifice.""  He succeeded.  I will never look at a crucifix in the same way again.",The Passion of the Christ
1554,amccool,How about we actually discuss the movie AS A MOVIE,10,12 April 2004,"First off, this post IS NOT intended to deal with the rights or wrongs of religion. I simply want to talk about the film as cinema.
I waited nearly a month to go see the movie and was prepared for a bloodbath. I had been bombarded with warnings that it was ""the bloodiest movie ever made"" and that it was ""violent for the sake of violence."" After watching the movie I thought about it and while it was bloody, it was nowhere near as bloody, I think, as any Quentin Tarantino. Also, I feel that the whole point of the movie was to show what Jesus went through (or, for anyone who isn't a Christian, what he is rumored to have gone through) when he was crucified.One of the problems I had with this movie was what I felt was an overabundance of slow-motion shots. I realize that they are meant to add to the dramatic effect, but I felt that they slowed down the movie more than was necessary.I really liked the fact that the movie was done in Aramaic and Latin. I have heard people complain that it made it difficult to follow, but to that I say, learn to read. Anyway, I was very impressed with the actors ability to perform the lines with emotion and inflection, when they were all speaking a languages that either no longer exist, at least not in the form they used in the movie. Also, their Latin was very good. I speak some (emphasis on some) Latin and was able to understand enough to see that their inflections and emphasis were excellent.Overall, I thought that the movie was excellent. Anyone who wants to respond to what I wrote is more than welcome, but please remember, this post is not intended to be about anyone's personal religious feelings, so please either keep that to yourself or start a new post.",The Passion of the Christ
1555,Grillsy87,No character development.,6,8 January 2005,"Before going on, I would like to say, that I am a Christian.This film was made by Christians for Christians. There is no merit in that. The film is called the ""Passion"" because it deals with Christ's final twelve hours before the crucifixion I understand this, but the film makes very little effort to endear the character of Jesus to the audience. Christians already have a built in love of Christ so of course they are moved by the film, so what. Our duty as Christians is to witness and share the gospel with others, so that we may glorify the Lord and bring people to him. This movie has about a much power to convert as the Exoricist. It scares people. It is a horror film. Granted, the suffering of Jesus was truly horrific, but what the the glorious miracles he performed? What about the people He healed? In order for people to feel love for Jesus, they must see the love that He showed us.",The Passion of the Christ
1556,DCOrkin1,Mels Passion for Violence,4,3 March 2004,"The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson's third directorial undertaking, is a vivid and brutal look at the death of Jesus. While Gibson's aspirations may be noble this film is inaccessible to any with a different religious agenda than the maker; a devout catholic. In the end the film's lack of focus and its overall gruesomeness do nothing to uplift the spirit and leaves the audience unmoved and disgusted.The one aspect of this movie that stands out the most is the overwhelming violence. Gibson was clearly trying to stir people by showing how brutally Jesus died. However the film's violence does just the opposite. Rather than inspiring the audience through Jesus' suffering, the film assaults them with hard to watch bloody images. In place of glory there is gore, and in place of inspiration there is violence. In many places Gibson relies on blood in place of story.Perhaps the biggest flaw of this movie is its pacing. It spends far too much time on certain parts, and not enough on others. It seems to take Jesus 45 repetitive minutes to carry the cross up to the top of the mountain and only about 15 minutes for him to be crucified and die.The film is mostly about the final hours of Jesus' life, but it also features other parts of Jesus' life story which are never fully developed. There are little flashbacks throughout, including pieces from the last supper and the Sermon on the Mount. It would have added to the overall message of the film to have shown these as complete scenes and not just as footnotes. In a film where so much is missing there is so much that is not necessary. Of all the extra elements the most out of place is the recurring image of Satan. From beginning to end this film features a representation of what appears to be Satan himself complete with possessed children. If Gibson wants his movie to be taken seriously as a historical documentation it is necessary to omit demonic images that look like something out of the `Lord of the Rings'.This movie has its strong points too. James Caviezel, a devout catholic himself, delivers an impressive turn as Jesus. While making this movie Caviezel dislocated his shoulder, was whipped while filming the torture scene, and was struck by lightning; that's devotion to a role. The film also features a fantastic musical score by John Debney, which has a middle-eastern flavor to it.Rather than having a real developed story line this movie is more about an idea: Jesus died brutally. Gibson demonstrates this idea so graphically it reduces a sacred religious account to nothing more than a two hour glorified snuff film veiled in controversy.",The Passion of the Christ
1557,bigkingfisher76,"Epic, great movie...",10,28 February 2004,"I've been so caught up in the spiritual merit and boldness of this movie, that I hadn't stopped to consider how great it might be as a work of cinematic art. In that regard, it is stunning. The acting is extremeley strong throughout; the cinematography is breathtaking; this is an epic, great work of cinema. In addition to that, the aspects I had considered before - the spiritual elements - were penetrating to the core. What is art, after all? Taking great, eternal, timeless, universal themes - and in this case, historic truth - and rendering it in such a way that you are caught off guard and impacted deeply and lastingly. This is that, by any standards or measurement. Forget the mis-placed controversy and the superstar backing, and just enjoy this moving masterwork.Do yourself a favor - don't miss out on seeing this gorgeous and historic movie on the big screen.",The Passion of the Christ
1558,ron-henry,My yearly reminder,9,4 April 2010,"Every Easter week I sit down by myself and watch The Passion of the Christ by Mel Gibson. This movie is a very realistic portrayal of what probably occurred in the last hours leading up to Jesus' crucifixion. I do this to give myself a very graphic reminder of what Christ endured for you and me.Most people do not fully understand what Jesus had to go through and why (even many devout Christians). Up to that point in time, the Jewish religion ritually sacrificed animals for the forgiveness of their sins. They believe that the BLOOD of the animal was the purifying substance that cleansed them of their sins. The ritual was completed, not by the average person, but by the High Priests at the Temple in Jerusalem. The Torah (Old Testament) prophesized that a Messiah would come and save the Jewish people. They believed, however, that this King of the Jews would be an actual king and lead them to victory over all of their enemies. The truth is that the Messiah came to save their souls, and that HE would be the ultimate Sacrifice for the forgiveness of their sins. This meant BLOOD had to be spilled in the Jewish tradition. The proof that Jesus was the true Messiah was that He conquered death by coming back to life after three days. I am not trying to ""preach"", but knowing these pieces of information may help understand the film better and give you a reason for the extensive use of blood in the movie.Sodoes the film contain a lot of gory and bloody, violent scenes? Yes. Was this necessary for the storyline of the film? Absolutely. As several comments statethe word ""passion"" means in this context to be about the SUFFERING that Jesus went through in those hours leading up to the final crucifixion. The movie examines a very short window of time. Those who were disappointed that Mel Gibson did not show more about Jesus' ministry and teachings need to revisit the meaning of passion. Maybe someday Mr. Gibson will make a film about the LIFE of the Christ and go into great cinematic detail about his few years teaching the people in the area around Galilee and Jerusalem. But that is NOT what this movie is about. AND, if they were disappointed that POTC failed to convey the lesson of Jesus' love and compassion from his teachings, then these people REALLY don't see the constant references (through flashbacks and dialogue) of how these events and his crucifixion was the ultimate expression of love.Was this an anti-Semitic film? Absolutely not. Case in pointif someone makes a film about the horrors of Auschwitz (like Schindler's List)does this mean that Steven Spielberg hates all Germans? Of course not. Were the Sanhedrin the ones who brought Jesus to trial and convinced Pilate/Romans to crucify him? Yes. Does that mean that ALL Jewish people are bad? Does that mean that Mel Gibson hates Jews? Of course not.James Caviezel's acting was amazing especially in the fact that he was able to vividly express so much emotion, pain, suffering (and love) using an ancient language. Wow. The cinematography is probably the best I have ever seen (with Saving Private Ryan coming in at a very close 2nd place). The sets are a little too ""period-ish"" and to me looked like they skimped on that part of the budget. However, on the other side, the use of real Italian cities and landscapes gave a very effective portrayal of the era. The application of so much slow-motion photography can be a little over done at times, but as anyone who has experienced a car crash or some very dramatic event knows, your mind DOES capture the time in slow-motion (which has been scientifically proved to be true). And this movie is a VERY dramatic event.No film is perfect in every way, and no story is ideal to all viewers. But Mel Gibson made an amazing effort to give the world HIS perspective of this world-changing event in a very dramatic style. I recommend it to all people as a way to remind them of what Christ did for all of us. The Easter season is a great time to watch this movie to get us all in the proper frame of mind to understand just why we celebrate Holy Week.",The Passion of the Christ
1559,carbonium,"""The Passion of the Christ"" deserves two thumbs up!",10,29 February 2004,One of the best movie I have seen this year. I don't see any anti Semitism in this movie. What you see is in the New Testament. Great photography and music score. It can be bloody at parts but that's how it should be. Did it work? Yes it did. The movie left me speechless. Well done Mel.  There are many reviewers that are utterly unreliable. Go see the movie for yourself before judging it.My score: 10/10,The Passion of the Christ
1560,donquixote1981,Artistic Achievement,10,26 February 2004,"I am glad that Mel Gibson had the courage to make this movie, going against the grain of ""Hollywood"" style blockbusters, and made a piece of cinema comparable with the artistic auteur films of the 70s.  The theme of the movie seemed heartfelt to Gibson, something he felt important enough to put on screen despite what critics said.  In terms of it's so-called anti-semitism, I felt like it was almost the opposite, and as my girlfriend is Jewish I am particularly sensitive to this issue.  The Sanhedrin were Jewish priests, yeah, but wasn't the character (possibly added for the intention of diminishing any anti-semitism criticism) who helped Jesus with the cross Jewish and the woman who offered him a cup of water jewish and also Jesus himself?  If anything this movie gives Roman soldiers a bad representation as bloodthirsty goons and ignorant against the Jewish plight for solidarity under Roman rule. The Romans call the jews ""impossible people."" It is argued (See Karen Armstrong's ""Holy War"") that Jesus was part of the Jewish uprising against the Romans along with John the Baptist.  So while this movie paints the Sanhedrin as bloodthirsty bureaucrats and Pilate as indecisive and torn, I don't think it painted all Jews in the movie in the same light.",The Passion of the Christ
1561,UMANYAR42,VIOLENCE FOR A PURPOSE,10,27 February 2004,"Mel Gibson could not have possibly portrayed too much violence. The scenes were brutal, but they must be to show one Man bearing the sins of all men.  The pain was in realizing it was His choice, and the pain of Mary was the most difficult aspect to watch. The Jewish leaders were appointed by Caesar and over 10,000 other Jews were put to death during the life of Jesus. Only two groups appear in the film, Romans and the Jews of Judea. Both groups are shown to have some good and some evil in their hearts. Hard to see anti-Semitic aspect when Jesus, James, Mary, Peter, and Simon were all Jews...",The Passion of the Christ

The scouraging is so vivid and graphic that you are moved to tears for what this man went through.  Regardless if Jesus is real or not in your opinion, you feel sorry for the character and begin to identify with him.The whole media calling this movie anti-sematic before it even came out is a shame..

1563,sextons4jeshuah,Go! Don't fear seeing this amazing movie of the greatest Love ever shown.,10,27 February 2004,"This is a ""must see"" for all people, especially believers.  I was hesitant to go because I cannot take violence, even on regular television, and I feared I would not be able to handle an actual visual depiction of the extreme violence I knew had actually happened to Jesus.  However, since my fourteen year-old son wanted to go, and his school was going as a group, I decided I would go. I took along a lot of tissues (I knew I would cry) and earplugs (I had planned on closing my eyes but wanted to be able to mute the sounds also); I am glad I did.  I admit that I did have my eyes closed for much of the movie, and my ears plugged as well, but I saw and heard enough to confirm what I had studied and the scriptures say....that Jesus suffered unimaginable torture for us, not only the physical torture, which in and of itself is beyond comprehension, but also mental anguish, emotional pain, betrayal, abandonment, and spiritual separation from The Father.  Most heart wrenching is that this was all inflicted on undeserving and willing Purity Himself, because of my sins and for my love.  I cried from almost the very beginning and had to share tissues with the friends I sat with.  Everyone was speechless at the end.  My son took a long time simply to be able to say, ""Powerful.""  A half an hour later, a neighbor asked him his opinion, and all he could say was, ""Words fail me.""  I called a friend six hours after coming home and as I described to her my experience, I found myself crying again.  My tears, however, even this morning, the second day after seeing it, are tears of gratefulness, love and thanksgiving.  The one thought that is above all others in my mind and heart is that I have grown even closer to Jesus as a result of seeing the movie.  I love Him so much more now as I have again been reminded of His unbelievable, unfathomable, sacrificial love for me.  My prayer now is that if you are afraid or hesitant to go, you will get past that fear and go; I am very glad and grateful that I did. I also hope and pray that any ""prodigal sons"" (including one of my own), skeptics, agnostics, atheists, and people of all religions or no religion will also go and see for themselves this amazing display of Love.",The Passion of the Christ

I found many of the scenes overdramatized by the use of slow motion and music.  It seemed like every scene was built up as if it was the climax.  I am not a christian, but have read the bible at least three times, and i did not find this film was quite as accurate as many fans have been making it out to be.  This is not a film for the squeamish, if you cannot view intense physical abuse, stick to your Sunday school cartoons.",The Passion of the Christ
1565,takahlahtakahlah,"Spectacle over substance, Violence over veracity...",5,3 March 2004,"`It is as it was,' said the Pope and two billion Christians worldwide were ordered to see `The Passion of The Christ.' It is not just a moneymaking scheme (see this), its being hailed as a religious obligation. It had more pre-ticket sales than any other film in history. Mel Gibson's so called `labor of love' cost $25 million to make, a relatively small amount for Hollywood, and has already generated nearly $120 million in revenue.Actor-turned-director Gibson originally intended to release the film, which was written entirely in the dead languages of Latin and Aramaic, without subtitles. He felt that the performances should be able to stand on their own, and, lucky for us, it was released with subtitles. The main actors performances are decidedly one-note, which I guess could be due to the material. However, in defense of Mel Gibson and his actors, he does manage to create an image of Jesus rarely seen before: He is smiling. He is playfully splashing water in his mother Mary's face and He is laughing. This helps to break the stern mold of whom Jesus is perceived to be, if only for a moment. This helps to personify Jesus and, as was the intent of Gibson, create a Man with whom the audience could place their sympathies, and, to the religious, their gratitude. These are powerful images that play on exactly what the audience already feels: the overwhelming sense of impending doom.But therein lies another problem. A film is supposed to show the story, during which the audience needs little previously known information. This film fails miserably in this aspect. Being that I am not a religious person I had a little trouble at first following the characters. Couple this with the fact that we will not understand their names when spoken and you have just lost the ability to follow many of the supporting characters.
One such supporting character is the high priest Caiaphas, an unrelenting man to say the least. Gibson portrays Pontius, the Roman governor, as a character deep with inner-conflict. It has been brought to my attention that Caiaphas also struggled with what to do with Jesus however Gibson made this character one-sided, devoid of any emotion not resembling hatred. I believe this to be the center of the anti-Semitic controversy, placing all the blame on the one-sided, one-opinioned Jewish high priest. There is a certain amount of blame to be shouldered by Gibson in this regard yet I cannot help but write this off as Hollywood-induced screenwriting. Hollywood needs a bad guy for every epic, one figurehead antagonist against one protagonist, and Caiaphas was written to fit this part to a t.This film is so full of symbolism that if you begin to look for it, the task of finding them all will consume you. I felt like I was obsessive compulsive counting the sets of 3s onscreen. Allow me to explain: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (the Trinity) plays a huge factor, besides the bible-given plot that is, in this film. Many shots are framed around these groups such as three candles burning in the background behind Pontius Pilate during several scenes. More often than not, in any scene that Mary is in, Magdalene and Jesus's other disciple stand together, in a group of three. The nail driven into Jesus's right hand is pounded six times. Many scenes have a number of extras that would add up to multiples of three. There are three nails driven into the wood (of the cross) above Jesus's head in the shape of a triangle and Jesus falls, while carrying the cross, a total of six times. The crow pecks the nah-saying thief's eyeball three times, subtitles are displayed multiples of three at a time, etcetera, etcetera, I could go on for a while here.Roger Ebert, an old enemy of mine, gave this film `* * * *' stars in the Chicago Tribune, but let me be the first to tell you: he is wrong. This film decides to choose spectacle over substance, violence over veracity, and it shows blatantly. The way Gibson uses blood is perverse, especially the frequent slow motion stops that showcase the spatters of blood. One scene in particular shows (what I believe to be) a cat-of-nine-tails (another group of 3s) becoming deeply lodged into Jesus's back before being ripped out, chunks of flesh and all. This scene got the biggest audience reaction in which almost everyone cringed.Roughly 90 to 100 minutes of this film are spent showing Jesus being punished, which is, sufficed to say, not in a good balance with the rest of the material. Very few of Jesus's teachings are depicted and this allows the collective audience mind to hibernate and absorb the brutality above all else. This film is a superficial-at-best attempt to portray Jesus as `our Lord and savior.'",The Passion of the Christ

Even the Christian among themselves differ on bible issues, but there is not doubting the power and the purpose of Jesus.

If it were not Jesus and the situation was different, people really wouldn't care. ""Followers of Christ"" would gobble this up and love it forever because it is exactly what they want to believe. I might sound cynical, but that's exactly what my most insensitive side says.Being practically religiously illiterate, I didn't really know what was going on. Sometimes it did seem deeply spiritual but effected me only skin-deep. Other times it was blown over with stereotypes. I don't care what was written because it can just be interpreted another way. I had to cover my eyes because it was so darned violent.Great music, for those who care, and fine acting.

The film blames lots of people, not specifically the Jews. All right, about the storyline. The storyline can be told in about five minutes, a story which most of us - even non religious people like me - already knew before we watched this movie. What I hoped for was a movie that would tell me a bit more about Jesus and the good he did. Not just how he suffered in his last twelve hours. There are a few flashbacks, but these aren't any good either.For me, this movie did exactly the opposite of what I think it was aimed to do. Instead of feeling sorry for the man and seeing how much he suffered, I felt this irritation coming over me while watching it. I mean how many times do we have to see him fall down in slow motion for God's sake? If I hadn't known better I would think that Jesus was the world's most biggest weakling ever.

I have a very strong stomach when it comes to gore, but this nearly made me ill.  I'm not sure if it was that they were beating a man to shreds or if it was that they were beating Jesus to shreds.

It comes from a director motivated by a personal passion, his love for Christ. There aren't many movies out there that come from the heart like this one. So many films produced and distributed these days are half heartedlly produced and directed by a movie making factory that is run by lawyers only concerned with money. Here is a film financed fully by a director made with a pain staking attention to detail that is more than a movie, it is an experience. The film works, it is believable. You feel what Christ went through in a way that no other movie on Christ has been able to do before. Even if you aren't a Christian you should see this movie, for the same reason that you slow down on a highway to view the scene of an accident.

When all is said and done, this movie will not be remembered for the controversy that some tried to force on it, but instead will be remembered as a rare piece of cinematic perfection.",The Passion of the Christ
1576,andtheywonderwhy,horrible,1,16 March 2004,"I question anyone who has the gull to sit through the whole movie not only for its unnecessary violence but also for its message.  Instead of focusing on Jesus' message, which is altruism, the movie has anti-Semitic undertone, and moreover an undertone that all people should pay for what Jesus did. The movie is blasphemy for trying to tell the story of Jesus, a godly figure.  Needless to mention the movie depicts all the Jews who don't follow Christ as being ugly, despicable, and gross people, and I am not even Jewish.  This movie should be banned for all the hatred it is going to spread.  I am shocked that the pope approved this movie and frown upon his actions.",The Passion of the Christ

Never in my wildest dreams did I even consider the possibility a movie like this could exist.   It brought to life a story I've known my whole life.   It took me back to a more violent, biased time. It took me to a place I sometimes wish didn't exist.  However, if that time did not exist, none of us faithful Christians would be here.  The Passion of Christ made me think, made me sad, yet made me feel so wonderful that I'm a Christian.  This movie was moving, emotional, intense and down right phenomenal.   I have never in my life seen such a movie.   I have never in my life gone through such a spectrum of emotions in 2 hours 6 minutes.   I would suggest people to see this movie at least once in their lifetime, if not more.  I know I will go see it again.",The Passion of the Christ

He makes the Jewish clergy look absolutely monstrous and half the Romans look like sadistic brutes while the other half look truly sympathetic. Sad that Mel Gibson let his personal bigotry into what could have been a blockbuster!!! Mel Gibson is officially off my radar for movies, I'm so glad that I saw this on a DVD instead of paying a theater for the pain. This movie was literally painful to watch and thankfully for DVD, I could take regular breaks and do something else for a while. I was hoping for an inspirational movie to start Easter weekend, but Mel disappointed greatly.",The Passion of the Christ
1579,movieman-doyle,One of the best movies of all time and one nobody can ever forget.,9,16 August 2011,"""The Passion Of The Christ."" So, the story of this movie is the final 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ. And the last 12 hours are not great for Him, as he suffers the worst conditions... ever! I rented this movie before reading the reviews and loved it. Then, when I read the reviews, I was like, ""What the f**k?"" because people were hating the movie for one stupid reason: the brutal gore.The movie was violent because that is what Mel Gibson sees in the story of Good Friday. Your idea may be different but respect someone's vision. While watching the movie, you do fell bad for Jesus. How often can you say you felt bad for the Son of God. And without the violence, that feeling wouldn't have been possible. And, it's not like the gore was mindless and over-the-top. Honestly, I think that the amount of blood is realistic.That aside, the actors where great. They choose the right people to play each part and they played their part well. And that also helps the tone of the movie. The writing, editing, special effects were all just downright awesometaculatmazingtastic. I couldn't have asked for more.This film is not made to be entertaining. It's made to spread the word. Trust me, there are moments where I gagged and cried, but those moments worked for the movie. This movie is not for everyone. My neighbour is a Christan, but he coulden't sit through it. I feel, in order to get the benefits of the film, you should watch it, and think about it like this: ""Besides the gore, what was in the movie?"" I'll tell you what: one great movie, that hits all the things good movies have.",The Passion of the Christ
1580,Midwest204,This one is going to have people talking for a long time to come,10,26 February 2004,"If you go and see this movie and walk away without feeling moved then you are without a soul.  I sit here at :2:00AM still feeling the after effects of what I just saw.  I never would have thought that a movie could effect me so much.  I went by myself and I'm glad that I did because the tears came down about half way though the movie and didn't stop until the very end. When the movie ended it took about 2 minutes after the lights came on to get up out of thier seats.  No one talked.  I didn't see one person smiling. Even as people were coming out into the lobby it was just dead silence. Some people had tear stained faces and others looked as though they wanted to cry.  There were many scenes in the movie that were so heart wrenching that it was hard to watch at times especially when Mary was witnessing the continual beating of her son.  I have often thought of her pain but could not have imagined it.  Having seen this movie so late at night will make it difficult for me to fall asleep.  It had a very powerful and profound impact on me and the violence was something that I was not prepared for.  Yes I knew it was going to be violent but not to the extent of what it was. There were times when I just wanted to yell out ""Stop Killing Him - enough already""!!!  You just feel like your right there witnessing it all.  This is most definitely not a movie that you want to take your kids to and a movie that you should either see by yourself or with your loving spouse.To me this was the most powerful and the most violent movie that I have ever seen.This movie really portrays Jesus as a ""real"" man of flesh and bone who endures the most horrific back lashing suffering that I have ever seen on the big screen.  As far as this movie changing my views about the Jewish community I didn't feel that I walked away feeling any hatered for them in the least.  I hope this movie will make us all feel forgivness just as Jesus forgave those who crucified him.This one is going to have people talking for a long time to come.",The Passion of the Christ
1581,danny-c-clark,false testimony,1,24 May 2011,"Mel Gibson had generated a terrible mistake. The commandment of Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ had taught to Saint Matthew to pass on to us to learn at (Matthew 6:5 - 6) had been: ""And when you pray, do not be as the hypocrites be because the hypocrites love to pray standing up in the synagogues and the hypocrites love to pray on the street corners at where and so people can see them. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. Therefore, when you pray, go in to your room, close the door and pray to your Father in secrecy, who's unseen. Your Father, who sees what's done in secret, will reward you."". Obviously, Jesus Christ had never been and will never be a hypocrite, and therefore it's also obviously apparent that it's never been and that it's never going to be an any and all truth that Jesus Christ had ever authorized that an any and all person's and persons' (especially Jesus Christ's) own prayers be put out on to display so that an any and all person(s) see and hear. Therefore, don't allow Mel Gibson's own popularity and fame to deceive you because ""The Passion of The Christ"" 'blockbuster' movie of Mel Gibson had been a false testimony because he had deceived people in to believing that Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ's own disciple(s) had said and had shown that it had been the right to do to show Jesus Christ and others praying. Therefore, it's because the beginning scenes had been FALSE, that it's therefore that the remaining movie had also been FALSE because Mel Gibson had used (and had therefore abused) Mel Gibson's own filmed beginning scenes as the main tempo that was been therefore set to be carried through the remaining scenes in Mel Gibson's entire movie(s). Honestly, an any and all person(s) would be completing a nice favour for Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ's own disciples should those any and all person(s) not buy and not watch the movie ""The Passion of The Christ"" of Mel Gibson and ESPECIALLY because Mel Gibson himself had already been a millionaire before the time he had filmed ""The Passiong of the Christ"" of Mel Gibson.",The Passion of the Christ
1582,Rickote,From a secular point of view this movie is equivalent to porn,1,29 May 2011,"I was hopping to see some plot, dialog, or learn something from Jesus last hours. Instead, I saw two hours of unjustified torture and violence flesh and blood, with minimal dialogs or argument, just like in a porn movie you have all flesh and minimal arguments, but at least it is intended to arouse you. Actually there is more argument in an average porn movie. If you would get aroused or enjoy somehow watching all this nearly two hours of torture, you may have a problem. Of course this is my point of view, a normal person, then I can understand that if you are a ""True"" Christian you may have a feel of duty to suffer for two hours along with your ""Jesus"". I had to past forward the very long segments of blood and torture since they were painful and disgusting to watch and they didn't have dialogs or add almost nothing to the movie.",The Passion of the Christ
1583,kidaisborn,A mark in moviegoing history.,10,15 March 2004,"Mel Gibson made this movie despite all of the media madness that called it anti-semetic.  He is fullfilling his purpose in life that is given by God. His efforts are definitley paying off BIG TIME!  This movie is completely capturing and amazing.  It makes you feel like an onlooker into history of the crucifixion of Christ.  Very violent, but not as brutal as what Jesus Christ actually suffered.  It was necissary to make it violent to make it more real, and to stir up people's emotions and make them actually THINK about the meaning behind what they are watching.  There are a couple of instances that are not biblical such as the evil demons going after Judas, but this is in the movie to show that Judas had inner demons torturing him because of his betrayal to Jesus.  Judas obviously had these inner demons, and he committed suicide because of them.  After I watched this movie, I left feeling like an emotional wreck and completely UNWORTHY of God's love for me.  I love Him now more than ever, and think about what he did for me which makes me think twice before I sin.  This movie is what the world needs amongst all of this worldwide chaos that we are experiencing.",The Passion of the Christ
1584,andrew-kennedy,Un-entertaining,1,15 July 2004,"This film is awful. Forgetting any question of whether it is faithful to the bible or realistic, it lacks any redeeming quality. The script consists of catchphrases from the bible; there is no character building or explanation of who anyone is; there is no moral to the story; nor are there any amusing parts (except the men with the funny hats).Whereas seemingly pointless violence is a feature of many films (I loved Tarantino's Kill Bill), in this film it isn't stylish, there genuinely seems no point in it and it goes on and on.All in all, I feel like I have wasted 2 hours of my time in watching it; and it could only be fun for people who enjoy torture.",The Passion of the Christ
1585,from_the_hearth,Hardly the greatest film ever,4,1 March 2004,"I thought that this movie was at best mediocre.  It had some really wonderful moments.  The flashbacks, in particular, were beautifully done and probably held more important content than the other 9/10 of the movie. The rest...I already knew Jesus died, and horrifically.  I didn't feel any more inspired by seeing it played out on screen, especially when it was so blatanly obvious to me that the movie was completely one-sided, slanted, and going for the most extreme portrayal humanly possible.Let's start with the Roman guards.  If there were any doubts at all about who the good guys were and who the bad guys were, we should've been more than tipped off by the rotting teeth and the maniacal expressions on the faces of the Roman guards.  Let me just ask you something: why do you think the Romans were so mad at Jesus?  Why did they want to literally beat him to a pulp?  What was there personal issue with him?  Assuming that the jobs of these men are to mete out punishment every single day, we have to assume that this is something that they are accustomed to.  Maybe this has made them crazy, but considering that the Romans in general were known for bloody sports and the fact that they had been doing this job for a presumably long time, I would probably have to say they were going to look at it just as more as they were doing exactly what they had to do.  The way these guards, who were relatively low on the totem pole, were portrayed was in my humble opinion completely ridiculous.  It completely disrupted my suspension of disbelief.  In fact, it completely took me out of the narrative, and I was just thinking, ""This is so unbelievably stupid.  They have no reason to be behaving this way.  This is their jobs.  Why do they look the way they do? Is this supposed to be realistic?""  In my opinion, it was a huge directorial mistake and it should have been a glaring one to everyone in the audience.Next, Satan.  I thought that this was completely overdone and perhaps not even necessary.  Again, completely interfered with my ability to take this narrative seriously.  It was downright cartoonish at most points, and again, completely took me out of the narrative.  Speaking of cartoonish, when the criminal got his eyes poked out by the bird, I literally started laughing. It was quite possibly the worst moment of the entire movie because the camera work was absolutely awful.  It was like watching Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" only you'd think 40 years later, the effect could be pulled off with a little more grace and realism.  (I think I've pointed out, though, more than adequately that I don't think that this is the movie's strongest point.)Finally, I just really didn't understand the point of showing two hours of blood and gore.  In my opinion, his life and resurrection are much more important than his death.  Considering Gibson's ridiculously overdone portrayal of the other characters, I couldn't help but think that Gibson had probably done the exact same thing with the scenes of brutality.  What's more, if you take into consideration that in that day alone, they were crucifying three people, they probably did the same thing to at least a thousand people each year, in that city alone.  The fact that people died horrific and gruesome deaths in that time period is really nothing special or shocking, if any of you know anything about history.  The most important thing about his death was what he did for us -- and I just felt that the true meaning was obscured by all the brutality.",The Passion of the Christ

I was drawn into this movie and felt an experience like I have never felt before. The movie is flawless. The scenes of Christ suffering for me will be with me forever. I feel this is the most beautiful love story ever made.The fact that Jesus would endure a most horrific death so that I could be saved shows the love of God for us. Mel has done the movie in such a way that you feel you are there.

1587,lovedtilforever,Watch It!,10,5 April 2016,"When this movie came out, I was just a kid and I watched it. I didn't understand anything but cried my eyes out when Jesus was getting beaten. I recently decided to watch it again. I didn't realize what an effect it could have on me. I noticed all the details and symbols used. There is a detail that especially stood out; the drop of rain from heaven. Everything about this film is amazing. The music is enough to make me cry. (It lost an Oscar to A Series of Unfortunate events) I want to thank Mel Gibson for directing this. He did something most directors are afraid of doing. Jim Caviezel's acting is amazing and make up seems so real.Many people who watched this film would say that it's too graphic. It is. That's how it was. Jesus didn't get beaten once or twice, He got beaten many, many times. The film shows what He really went through. That's the point. Most people are going to either hate it or really love it. Those that hate it are scared. They can't bear to imagine that this could be true. They'll use the beating scenes as an excuse to say that this movie was bad. This film is supposed to make you cry. The moment you see Jesus getting beaten is when you realize that this innocent Man went through all of this for you. I realized that I deserve that not Him. I turned my head because I was scared of seeing my sin. I don't think anyone can make another film like this. It truly was astonishing.Watch this movie. If you're an atheist, watch it. If you're a Christian, watch it.",The Passion of the Christ

To say it is anything else is just pathetic.

This could be a really good tool for those who want to talk about spiritual matters . It is bound to generate a lot of discussion. - but it is hard to watch, please don't take kids - don't bother with popcorn you won't want to eat it, mine went under the seat early in the show, as I realized this is not entertainment this is the pictorial of our Lord's suffering. I highly recommend it. Accuracy? Would I change anything in it? Probably,  but I won't say what  - yet.  It did make me think - I realized Jesus was a carpenter for good reason, it was part of his preparation. I work in carpentry, carpenters, know how to work with wood; they must just to be able to move it, they usually develop a love for wood, they love its grain and texture, even the feel of it and they love to mold and shape it, to their will, so Christ most likely loved wood (He created it) - He would embrace it, carry it, move it, and eventually he would die on it: He did not mold the cross it to his will , But to the Father's will that we might have life. When you see the movie you will understand my comments. I have spoken to one man who thinks they over did it, but I've read the scriptures and studied the times - I think this is very close to the truth, hard, brutal and graphic truth - According to the gospels this movie represents Jesus was scourged. Roman law did not limit the number of times a person could be beat. in the book Manners and Customs of the Bible  (Freeman, 1972: page 392) they talk of the Scorpion-a rather nasty weapon sometimes outfitted with hooks, which may be similiar to the one used in the film. ""Roman beatings often resulted in death. just from the beating."" Church Tradition has it that Jesus was beat with Forty Stripes with a cat of nine tails. (this could've resulted in 351 wounds 39 x 9) Jewish law forbid over forty so one was normally deducted so they would not go over. This is what The Apostle Paul refers to. I did not see any number of stripes listed for Jesus in any of the Gospels or the mention of a cat of nine tails (if you find one - please e-mail me) I think this is probably because He was beaten under Roman Law. not Jewish law. Anyway see the movie and invite others, pray and then invite them to studies, and churches to talk about the movie. This could be a great opportunity to reach out to others. Originally I thought it would be hard to watch with the subtitles, but it moved along beautifully. I heard many tears in the audience, and saw no popcorn in evedence at the end of the movie, I Highly recommend it. And will invite several if possible to see this movie.",The Passion of the Christ

Over the first fourteen years of my life I knew little to nothing of Christ and and his sacrifice. Attending an SDA boarding school gave me insight into the religion, but I wavered in my faith. I was hoping this movie would help strengthen my faith. That is exactly what it did. Though I normally have a very weak stomach where blood and gore are concerned, I found Passion rather easy to watch. An hour into the film, I was in tears, and I didn't stop until the end. The emotion behind a scene as simple as Mary watching a young Jesus fall brought me to tears. I am so happy with this film, and the power in it.

1591,drfunbags,"Beatings, Beatings, Beatings, Guilt.",4,15 July 2006,"I avoided watching this one until I could see it free on television so that I wouldn't be supporting the makers of a clearly shameless attempt to guilt the masses into forking over millions at the box office, just because they want to be good believers.The cinematics were predictable but fair, except for a few instances where creative license went askew. As for the story, it followed the biblical account well... to a point. To illustrate the suffering to the nth degree some brazen inaccuracies in the story were added (overlooked) for dramatic effect.To address the accusations of antisemitism, they are sound. Many people will tell you ""It's not antisemitic because that is what happened"", but since the story can not be corroborated, it is just that, an antisemitic story. There is no way to deny that Jews were meant to be seen as villainous in the biblical account of the crucifixion, and thus are seen in the same light in the Passion of the Christ.This film to a believer may be beautiful in it's representation of the suffering and self sacrifice of their deity, but to anyone else it will be about 10 minutes of Aramaic, followed by 90 minutes of blood, gore, torture, and horrors that you probably could have lived without seeing.The main questions at hand are:-Was this film entertaining?

Everyone sat quietly in their movie seat and watched the credits. It was absolutely amazing, and changed my life. When I hear people, especially critics, say this movie was too violent, it really annoys me. This is a real depiction of Jesus' last 12 hours before being crucified. Mel Gibson didn't sugar coat it so it could get a PG-13 rating to draw in a larger crowd. He took 4 Gospels and made it into a cinematic classic. Jesus WAS tortured horribly, and Jesus DID have nails put through his hands and feet. People know this when going into the movie, yet they complain about it being too violent.

1593,SmitTheElf,Just 'cause it's about Jesus doesn't mean it's good.,1,28 March 2004,"Mel Gibson's `The Passion of the Christ' will be viewed by some as a great movie, but it could have been so much more. The film, about the last twelve hours of Jesus' life obsesses itself with the physical torment he went through, and is rather scanty when it comes to genuine emotion. The film is unable to succeed on an emotional level by itself, and requires the audience to be of devout Christians if they are to feel much emotion. One did not have to be a prison inmate to be moved by `The Shawshank Redemption', but preexisting emotional ties to this film's subject matter are necessary. The major mistake was to only showcase Jesus' last twelve hours. This makes it impossible to establish the relationships of the other characters to Jesus. Yes, we know that Mary is his mother, but we never really see them normally interacting in the movie. If an extra half hour to forty-five minutes had been added to the beginning to establish and strengthen these relationships, we would feel a lot more when Mary watches him die on the cross. As it is, we feel relatively little for the characters, despite universally brilliant acting. There is nothing wrong with copious amounts of blood and gore, as it is realistic, but putting so much in while disregarding the powerful bonds these characters had for each other was a grave mistake. The scenes where Jesus is beat are powerful only because of their ferocity and, if the viewer is a Christian, the accurate portrayal of what Jesus endured to save mankind from damnation. If Gibson had made it clearer what these characters felt for one another, the power of these scenes would have been several times greater. Although we are not allowed to feel the emotion of the characters, it is clear that they themselves feel a great deal of emotion. James Caviezel is very effective as Jesus, trying to reconcile his human and divine characteristics as he awaits execution. The most effective scenes in the film are in the opening, before the blood-fest begins, when he is waiting for soldiers to come and arrest him. Caviezel manages to portray a noble man, intent on doing his duty, while still showing a degree of trepidation and unwillingness to face the gruesome fate that he knows is waiting. This accurate interpretation of Jesus as a genuine fifty-fifty split of humanity and divinity is what the movie should mainly be remembered for. Also called upon to show emotion are Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother, and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene. Although I can't recall the latter having any lines whatsoever, both of them do give excellent portrayals of grief throughout the movie. That the film doesn't let us feel for their grief is not their fault. Despite the overall lack of emotion, there are a few cases where the emotional level rises (although even here it's debatable whether emotion is from the movie itself of personal views). For me, the moment of greatest emotion was when one of men being executed with Jesus begged for forgiveness. I suppose this is because it's easier to identify emotionally with a sinner because more people have sinned than have given birth to Jesus. Most other viewers will probably be moved the most by a different moment, or maybe not at all. Nonetheless, in my case, this was a refreshing moment in an otherwise emotionally bland film. Moreso than other films, the quality of `The Passion of the Christ' is dependent on the individual viewer. Personal background is the main force determining how you will view this film. For many, this will be a four star, sensational movie, and for others it will be a bland mess. I admire what Mel Gibson was trying to do by showing Jesus' suffering in detail, but the truth is that it doesn't take much skill to show blood and gore. If greater emotion and meaning had been given to the admittedly necessary violence, this movie would have been truly great.",The Passion of the Christ
1594,minister_x,Stunning. Haunting. Beautiful.,7,25 March 2004,"This film was a visually haunting experience. To see a man so compassionate and so loving be driven through agony was an exhausting experience. The scourging, although hard to watch, was not over the top, but very very brutal. The scene of motherly love was moving to observe, and as a whole film it will show you the Bible in a completely different way. Although it could be taken as anti-semitic, those who have seen the film will know this is not true, the finger is not solely placed on the Jews, it is placed on everyone.

1595,Valandil,Brilliant,10,25 February 2004,"*Possible spoilers throughout*The first word that came to mind was ""WOW."" What Mel Gibson has done is not only brave, it is also brilliantly done.As someone who has seen A LOT of movies, I can say that the cinematic side of this is astounding. The camera work was some of the best I've ever seen. The flashbacks were seamless, and very well placed. The make-up job on Jesus was simply the best I've ever seen. He really looked like he'd been beaten half to death. The acting was brilliant. James Caviezel was perfect. Mary was also amazing.As for the score, it was perfect. It couldn't have been done any better. It really drives home the emotional moments. I was actually ok with the subtitles, especially at the beginning of the crucifixion. I think it would have been nice without them, but that scene with Jesus being nailed down wouldn't have been the same if we didn't know what He was saying. As for the language, most of it was Latin, and my friend who speaks Latin very well said it was perfectly done.As far as the claims of anti-Semitism go, there is not even a hint of it as far as I'm concerned. Many people were responsible for Jesus' death, not just the Jews. It wasn't even all the Jews, it was mainly just the leaders. The movie shows what I took as the leaders paying people to come and shout for Jesus to die. You also have Pilate, who is the one directly responsible for His death. Then there are the soldiers to beat Him and nailed Him to the cross. But really, as many others have said, every person who ever lived is responsible for Jesus' death. It was because of our sins that He came to die.While on the subject, that is one of the main things this film makes you realize: it was OUR fault that Jesus died. Many of us Christians went in thinking ""wow, this is going to be great! It'll make us on fire so we can go out and save people!"" I guarantee you, not a single person left the theater happy. We all realized that He came and took all that....the flogging, the ridicule, the shear torture, not to mention being nailed to a tree and killed....because of US. The part of the movie that made me break down was when He was first being nailed to the cross. You see the nail pierce His hand, you hear it being pounded into the wood. You see the blood covering His body. You can only imagine the agony He's going through. And yet, the only words out of His mouth are ""Father, forgive them."" That is the main message of this movie: through all that, He still thought of US. That He loved us so much that He would CHOOSE to die. When He reaches the top of the hill, he CRAWLS ONTO the cross.In short, this movie won't make you feel good. But it will make you sit back and realize what that sacrifice really meant, how much it cost Jesus. That, in the long run, will make you feel better than anything possibly could, though.On another note, the violence is very heavy. You sit and watch as the soldiers beat Him with rods, then with cat-o-nine-tails. You watch the flesh being ripped from His side. It's not pretty, and it will probably turn most of you off. But it was necessary. VERY necessary.Go see this movie. I don't care what religion you are. This movie is pure brilliance.",The Passion of the Christ

Passion of The Christ is an experience, its the type of Film that makes you analyze your life, one that you wont soon forget.

1598,jpdunsdon,Awful.,1,25 January 2012,"This Movie is so bad that at times it almost satirizes itself. Cue mood music and slow-motion.It does prove some things however.... A) With religion anything is possible, especially making money. B) A lot of people are latent sado-masochistic. C) If you give a man something heavy to carry and whip him, it will take longer.That an adult can take this movie seriously in the 21st century is shocking. That it can be presented to children as something noble, and worse, that they are part of, is evil.RIP Christopher Hitchens.

I came in not really knowing what to expect, and being a regular church-goer, I was anxious to see this.  After seeing it, I can safely say that this movie was well worth the money and the time.  It is my all-time favorite, I think.I remember during the movie, hearing my roomate, sitting a seat away, crying.  During the scene where Jesus is crucified, I suddenly found myself crying.  I cried again when his mother, the Virgin Mary, held him in her arms after he died.  This was the first movie that I have ever cried during. I definitely plan to see this movie again, and having seen it makes me appreciate even more what Jesus went through, and why he did it.  ***** out of *****",The Passion of the Christ
1600,riff-11,"Good, but subjective...",8,18 April 2004,"For all the people that don't want to see the movie because of the high level of gore, I can assure you that it's not all that bad. It could have been A LOT worse than this. Besides the fact that you see Jesus walking in red for most of the movie, and the fact that there IS a torture scene in the movie, at the court of Pilatus. Some shots in this scene are quite heavy, but it's not all the time like that.Well, the movie. The movie left a very satisfying impression on me when I walked out of the cinema, and when I have that, I know I went to a good movie and that I didn't waste any money. That's a good thing! The movie itself is quite amusing, you never get bored unless you don't care about religion or social and psychological developments related to religion. If you want to see some hot action, don't go to this movie. Only go if you're open for it, and ready for new impulses.I gave this movie an 8, because it's quite satisfying. It's a little hard to catch sometimes, because of all the cryptical talk and the Hebrew, but that's not very hard. It's good, but it still remains a subjective interpretation from Gibson, who nontheless did a very good job!",The Passion of the Christ
1601,Lloydxmas,Do not judge this movie,10,25 February 2004,"The only comments you should believe about this movie are your own, so don't take what I say too much to heart. I think this movie is so deep that everyone can take away something different. I am a christian, but this movie appealed to me for far more than just religious reasons. This is one of the best and most moving movies i have seen in a long time. The acting, the plot, the characters, every aspect is superb. The violence everyone is making a big deal about is essential to the story, and is in no way over the top or sadistic, but emphasizes Jesus' love for the people. I read that this is the most gut wrenching and most violent movie ever filmed. But I found the violence was used to tap sympathy, not disgust. The violence in movies such as Kill Bill were alot more disturbing than that of the Passion (I'm not criticizing Kill Bill. Great Movie). And as for anti-semitism, I really don't understand why this movie would be called anti-semetic. There are many jews and non-jews in this movie that, although they don't believe, feel that Jesus did not deserve his punishment. If anything, I would say that the movie portrays the Romans as the greater evil. The men that torture Jesus take such joy in doing so. Anyways, a great movie that everyone, christian or not, should see.",The Passion of the Christ

Please, dont listen to those religious people that tell their followers to take thier kids to see this movie. This is not a kids movie. Kids dont need and must not see this type of movie to believe.Is it anti-semetic? Well i can see where ADL(is that their name?) is comming from, but by the end of the movie, the last thing on your mind is Jews or Romans or whoever. The only thing thats in your mind at the end is your the one whos supposed to be in that man on the screens place.",The Passion of the Christ
1603,korters,A great movie that has been misunderstood and slammed by many,10,25 February 2004,"Possible SPOILERS (obviously if you're not familiar with the bible and the crucifixion of Christ, this whole review is a spoiler)To start off I thought this movie was very moving.  Christ was portrayed very well. The story was also very carefully handled.  I do agree that it was a very graphic and violent movie, but keep in mind that this was Christ's last 12 hours, and plus it is a crucifixion, it WILL be very violent and messey (we shouldn't try to shelter ourselves from the truth that forms of justice (even false justice, which was Christ's case because he was falsely accused of blasphemy) were very barbaric at the time, they were not clean and sugar coated like  most of the things we see in today's world).  Plus I thought the violence was on the level of Saving Private Ryan, but does anyone complain about that movie's violence?  No, because it doesn't deal with religion.  Another thing I find is that this film is in no form or way anti-semetic or anti-Roman.  Think about it, Jesus Himself was a Jew, also he taught (as He does in the movie) to love those who love you as well as your enemies (so hating the jews would be going against the teachings).  Plus think about it mostly Jews were prevalent in the crucixion of Christ because they thought He was a heretic (anyone who says that they are the son of your god and you dont believe, obviously you'd think the person was insane), but in no way do I feel that these people are responsible for his death, we all are.  After seeing this movie I actually love Jews more than ever, as well as anyone else.  And the deal with the whole anti-roman sentiment, its garbage as well, I mean think about it, ""Roman-Catholic"" didn't come from non-romans, and the vatican is located in Rome as well.One last thing, this movie is indeed violent, but, speaking from a Christian's point of view, I didn't find it overdone, instead it shared huge visual insite on the great amounts of torture Jesus had to go through in order to save our souls (and the thing is, He is the Son of God, so He could have easily killed those that were persecuting Him, but He didn't, he WILLFULLY endured these tortures so that we may enter into Heaven; now thats committment to one's people), plus as I said this is pretty much a realistic depiction, no fluff (so I definitly wouldn't recommend bringing your child to this, unless they are mature enough to understand Christ's sacrifice). Thats pretty much the message to love your enemies and those around you as well as to realize the pain Christ went through, WILLFULLY, during His last 12 hours.Also, I honestly think that many critics and hollywood are slamming the film due to it being a film based on religion.  As I said Saving private Ryan was graphic and violent, as much as the passion, yet they had any problem with it (with Saving Private Ryan), and obviously many of these critics don't want to see more movies like this produced, niether does hollywood because hollywood is what produces tons of exsessive filth filled movies with pro-sex, pro-drug, pro-violence, etc (not all, but vast amounts).  This movie is pretty much like an anti-violent movie.  Its just that I think the media and society have made open religion a very taboo thing (except if you're athiest, I feel these beliefs are getting shoved down my throat more and more everyday).  And from what I see many average people like you and me (those who have no real control over the media) are saying this movie has a real positive message and it is spiritual.  This makes hollywood afraid in my opinion, because if, due to this movie, many people may get closer to their faith and may no longer want to see the debachery that is shown in hollywood (or MTV, etc.), this way hollywood (and other debached companies) would lose tons of profits.But anyways, to end it simply, dont just catagorize this movie as garbage if you have not seen it.  See the film first (eventhough I think it will have more of a positive impact on Christians instead of non-believers (due to these individuals not understanding/caring the logic behind why Jesus died)).  If you don't like it, fine thats ok, every man his own opinion, just try to keep an open mind.",The Passion of the Christ
1604,n-j-terry,Passion of who?,1,14 April 2004,"The Passion of the Christ - Mel Gibson 2004So now I have seen it! Do I still think that you should go and see it? On balance yes, because I think Christians everywhere should be aware of what is in this film and be prepared to counteract the twaddle that it is. But go with your head on and not just your heart on your sleeve.Theologically Mr. Gibson has removed from us from any sense of Christology that has developed through modern theological process to a medieval, catholic blood and guilt basis for faith. 'Love me because I stand here as a visceral pulp of flesh and it's all your fault' is not a basis for any kind of faith I think. I can find nothing in the film, which has brought me any new insight into Christ or in the personhood of God.  We are probably more indebted for fresh insights into the nature of anthropomorphic sin as the devil appears in this passion a good deal more than in any other passion narrative I have seen. Auld Nick is even incarnated as a group of children during the film, which is a strange comment, from a director who grew up as one of 11 children and currently has 7 of his own.  Is the androgenous nature of this character also a comment on different sexualities? How are we developed as a society be the relation of evil to physical disability in this film?What we are left with is a documentary on how brutally effective Roman justice is on the borders of its then expanding empire.  Even this I find uninspiring. That this film is bloody has never been in question and that is not an aspect of it that I find terribly unpleasant, as I had never imagined the passion to be anything else. Does Mr Gibson really think that I need to be informed that a good scourging, dragging a lump of timber for a few miles and then being nailed to it was a party? In this respect the film is patronising of me, is tedious in its bloodletting and wholly un-engaging as we have no depth of character for this lump of meat we see so generously tenderised prior to being killed. We see nothing of the life that makes this story a 'Passion'. If we are to find meaning in this death, then is not in the life that led up to it and followed it? We do not see anything much of either of these. Several very corny flashbacks as Jesus drifts in and out of pain induced delirium and a 30-second flash of collapsing shroud and poor CGI are all else we know from this film. The poor CGI, combined with slow motion, spinning, overarching, overhead camera angles and mood lighting also add a complete sense of unreality to this presentation.I do not find the film to be overtly anti-Semitic as much is made of Jesus forgiveness for his persecutors and it is clear that not all of the Sanhedrin are behind the plot.  Arguments have and will continue to rage as to the historical accuracy of this film. I am not scholar enough to comment accurately. I don't feel the urge to beat up Jews all of a sudden. I don't feel nauseated, guilty, elated or any of the other vividly emotive responses that are recorded by viewers of this film. I am sad and disappointed. Sad that Marx may be right about religion if the numbers seeing this film are any indication. Sad that whilst popular culture has held Robert Powell as its picture of Jesus for 30 odd years that it will now accept Cavaziel for its reflection of Christ. Disappointed that, that which I had held as the most amazing of stories has been reduced to this cinematic travesty of orgiastic blood letting.Neal Terry 05/04/04",The Passion of the Christ
1605,paulord,How many times did Jesus Christ really die?,1,25 March 2004,"In my opinion, this film seems to serve only the purpose of manifesting someone's (formerly subconscious) obsession for beating and torturing - more than bringing forward someone's faith. This can be seen in the sheer devotion that the violence scenes are made with. Unfortunately, even in this case less could have been more. I believe that an average viewer realizes that if beaten and tortured like shown in this film, Jesus Christ would have died already during the first minutes of the beating (even if he was the Son of God). After that the violence starts to chew it's own tail. With every new picture of Christ's body being beaten up and covered with blood and wounds the film loses a little bit of it's power (Okay! I know that this is supposed to be a passion play...but still!). By the way, how much can a human body bleed?!This film has a huge contrast between those scenes with blood and violence and those without. Those scenes surrounding the scenes with violence lack the power that would have been needed to keep this film together and to prevent the violence scenes from losing their effect. It seems like the ""surrounding"" scenes are only there as a connection between the violence scenes. They lack the artistic vision that the violence scenes show hints of. Quite a lot could have been saved by better cinematography in those scenes. Using a cliché: The violence scenes are like bare bones without any flesh around them.Being the way it is now, the film (depending on the way one looks at it) is either a conventional mainstream movie with a bit more violence to give it some false credibility and to make it more shocking, or an art movie lacking the art, or a ""good"" big budget b-movie with some great gore scenes and bad acting!Making a film like this needs a good director more than just a believer. Anyway... Great story you got there from that good old book, Mr. Gibson!",The Passion of the Christ
1606,paltschwimmen,Praise and criticism,7,10 April 2004,"Two days ago I went to the cinema to see ""The Passion of the Christ"" and I'm still in a state of shock, I think. When I think about the film, a few hours later, I realized that it's probably a very good film, but it went a bit lost in all the torture and blood of Christ. I don't know if anything similar will ever be made, and it's probably for the best, because this is the way the story should be remembered and preserved. There's one thing in the film (besides all the blood and pain) that disturbs me a little, and it's the fact that the resurrection of Christ gets very little attention, leaving the viewer in a state of hopelessness. The people who will watch this film should have some knowledge in Catholicism, and biblical history as well. A good grade for this film is a well deserved grade... My opinion is that this film will get different receptions in different countries, depending on the religion and religiousness of people. However, what I KNOW is that ""The Passion of the Christ"" will shake people up, severely.",The Passion of the Christ

Yes this movie was a very bloody movie, but it shows what torture was like back then.  I wished the whole Bible would be portrayed in parts.  The Bible is not always going to be rated G.  I am glad that this was rated R.  Many people think that a Christian portrayed movie should be rated G or maybe rated PG... but the Bible is full of Rated R content as well as lower ratings.

1610,justin_bisset,Simply Amazing,10,23 February 2004,"As a believer, this film works to strengthen my beliefs.  The film stays true to the Gospel, while presenting the story in an amazing artistic form. Mel Gibson is a truly gifted director, taking one of the most beloved stories in history and making a remarkable film with it.  The grahic violence of the torture and death of Jesus, go to show what he went through, because of His love for us.  The film's portrayal of Satan seriously freaked me out.  But, Satan's sence of evil in the film is knocked clean down, each time you see a close-up of Jesus's eyes, looking straight at you.  All the anti-semitism people are talking about is really unfounded.  Yes, there are Jews involved in Jesus's death, but the film in no way puts the complete blame on them.  The blame rests on all who have sinned.  I am definitly going to see this movie again.  Bravo to Mel Gibson, for putting his heart into the project.  10/10",The Passion of the Christ
1611,kmm39,This movie's extremely moving!,9,24 February 2004,"The movie opens with Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus is played magnificently by Jim Cavizel. He should be nominated for an Academy Award for this role. He's excellent! The movie's subtitled in Aramaic and Latin but there's not much dialog so it's not hard to follow. The Devil's there with him. It's acted by a woman but in the movie the Devil's androgynous. It looks like a woman but has a man's voice with shaved eyebrows. And it has broken and ugly fingernails. Of course this isn't in the Bible but Gibson's view of good versus evil.It goes on to the betrayal of Judas and on to Jesus taken into custody. The Jews want Jesus dead so they take him to Pontius Pilate. This is in the Bible but Pontius Pilate in the movie does have conflicting emotions about putting Jesus to death. He's played as a sympathetic character whose wife wants him to let Jesus live. He wants to initially just punish him so he makes sure the Romans give him a harsh punishment. This is where the really graphic scenes take place!For about ten minutes you see the Romans beating Jesus with several weapons. Extremely violent! I know some people don't like violence so this is a warning to folks who don't like it. Stay away! Anyway, the Jews still protest to have Jesus die and Pontius Pilate seems to regrettably agree.As Jesus is crowned with thorns and throughout the extremely saddening violence and walk to Golgotha for his crucifixion you see flashbacks of his life. You see Jesus in his childhood falling down; you see him building a table and having a laugh with his mother and bits of the last supper, etc. His mother's played by a Jewish woman named Maia Morgenstern. I thought she was an effective Mary. After Jesus falls carrying the cross several times the Romans make Simon of Cyrene help carry the cross. He plays a bigger role in the movie than he did in the Bible. When Jesus gets to Golgatha you see him nailed to the cross. This lasts awhile along with the walk to Golgotha. John, Mary and Mary Magdalene are at the cross. Monica Belluci plays Mary Magdalene and while she has not one line in the movie her beauty has a great presence.The movie doesn't end there. It ends with the rising of Jesus on the third day. You see a cloth lying in a cave. And then Jesus standing up and walking away with holes in his hands from the nails.After the movie there was stunned silence. People were coming out of the movie crying. I totally recommend this movie to anyone. I know Christians and religious people will see it but don't look for the bad. This movie's about good.",The Passion of the Christ
1612,jlr608,"Amazing, a movie that gives an experience like no other",9,28 February 2004,"I have seen hundreds of movies in my lifetime, I actually learned the English language simply through the constant viewing of cable channels in which all I saw was movies. I have never felt this way about any other movie before. This is the only movie which I have left the theatre completly speechless.I was a very religious man at one point. As I grew older I experienced so many things that it took away my beliefs however it did not take away the many traits that I acquired through my religious years including compassion, love and the understanding of life. I'm not reviewing this movie saying it made me realize religion is the best way to live, I believe this movie's goals are not such, it's goals is for the viewers to realize what one man did in order to stop the wrongful ways of mankind.Through the severe suffering, what people consider the over-extensive amount of violence in this movie this movie stirs up our emotions to the final scene. Mel Gibson was not trying to point out the Jews and to blame them for everything, Mel Gibson was trying to point out every human being that saw this wonderfully communicating piece of art. Near the end when Mary is holding Jesus after taking him down from the cross, she stares straight at the audience, with a look that simply says ""Look what you have done, Aren't you proud?"". That was one of the very moments when tears fell from my eyes. The power of this movie is that it makes everybody feel guilty for their sins, or wrong-doings if you are not religious. It accomplishes it so very well, Mel Gibson put so much into this film, he did such a splendid job, he went as far as he needed to go to make his point and make it well, so well that it will boggle your minds whenever someone mentions the name Jesus. The cross will never be the same for me as it was before, the cross from now on means suffering, it means what we deserve for doing what we do as the human beings we are.I believe the quality of a film is measured by how well it meets its goal and how well it surpasses it, I went into the theatre with the attitude of any normal man, who takes the crucifiction of Christ for granted, like any other man who sees a symbol of a cross and thinks of nothing, but I came out a man who now feels unbelievably guilty over many of my own wrong-doings in life, a man who will forever rethink many of his decisions in life. I believe this film has accomplished its goal and too well. A+...",The Passion of the Christ

Going into the movie, I really didn't know what to expect. I've read alot of reviews..... and they were all like ""this movie changed my life"". I haven't seen many movies that I would say have ""changed my life"" until now. This movie changed my life.It's not likable. It's not entertaining. In fact, the entire time I wanted the movie to end. It drags on. It's exhausting. But it has to be.This movie does not endorse Christianity. It never shares the gospel. It never has opinions presented. It's simply the story of the death of Christ, line by line of the Bible. It's amazing how close it follows the scriptures. That's why I don't understand the controversy. It isn't like these people made this story up. IT'S THE BIBLE!!I don't wanna spoil anything for anyone. Just know that a good portion of the movie I was weeping. I wanted to jump into the screen and give Jesus a hug. As he was hanging on the cross, all I could think about was all the wrong things I've ever done, and how much Jesus was suffering for it. And I suddenly realized that as He was hanging there, the image of MY FACE flashed through His mind. And who am I? No one.When the movie ended, everyone just kinda sat there.... stunned. No movement. And we left the theatre eventually, and the girls and I just stared at each other. A few hugs and everything and then we left. The lobby of the theatre, although packed with people, was generally quiet. Everyone was just taking it all in.I can't really describe this experience. Everyone needs to see it. Film wise, the movie was very well done, just exhausting. But for the hour that we saw Jesus suffering, he was there for hours and hours more. I wanted to close my eyes so many times, but I knew I HAD to see it. I had to watch what happened to my sweet Savior.Nothing really matters right now. All my selfish wishes, all my deliberate disobedience, I feel like such an idiot. Life should be so simple. And He did it all because He loves me. HE LOVES ME. I believe in Him more right now than I ever have. Every wrong thing I've ever done, every evil thought that has run through my head hung there with Him on that cross.And all I can do is cry about it, watch it happen, and come to the conclusion once again that I am so unworthy, so much less than deserving, He is everything, and I am nothing without Him.",The Passion of the Christ

The beating scene w/ the cat-o-nine tails' was so graphic, the make-up department should get some sort of award.

Granted the flagellation, that was at the very least interesting. Watching Jim Caviezal grunt for 20 minutes as chunks of flesh are torn off by laughing Roman soldiers was impressive.However, after the first hour it gets a bit old, as we start to realize there's absolutely no plot and the characters are about as shallow as a puddle. The choice to portray Christ quite simply as a rag doll thats tortured in all ways imagineable for 2 hours is puzzling. Why not establish some sort of realistic background that would make me care that this man is getting the sh*t kicked out of him? Instead, we're given very flat and unconvincing flash back scenes that fail at their purpose of showing Christ as a loving human being. Flashes to a few scenes that last merely minutes in the larger violent mess. Meanwhile Mary and Magdelan simple follow Jesus crying with every snap of the whip trying to elicit some sort of emotion out of the audience. It doesn't work, nor does the lack of meaningful dialogue or character development. A devout agnostic, this movie had little affect on my relation towards the Christian religion or Christ as a character in a larger story.Christians who see this movie will inevitably rant and rave about how great a movie it was. And it may be, if your a devout Christian. To the average person expecting a realistic emotional portrayal of a major historical figure, it fails miserably in my opinion.

Sobbing was audible.  After the movie was over people slowly shuffled out of the theater and I heard comments like...""I never knew,"" ""He did this for me?"".  People were praising Him softly...to themselves. People were in the lobby grouped together and asking where they could go to Church on Sunday together...The Passion of the Christ (""The Passion"") was not a movie.  It was an EXPERIENCE.  This movie was not meant to entertain but to take each individual into a position of seeing and feeling Christ's passion as He experienced it and as He willingly gave up His life for us.  Thank you for the Cross, Lord.I did not find this movie anti-semitic at all.  As a matter of fact, I walked out with a feeling of guilt for  myself...not for the jews or the romans.  It was my individual sin and our collective sin that bought about Christ's crucifixion and instead of being angry at any specific group of people for that event...we should be grateful to the One who willlingly gave up His life for us.The music was thrilling, the locations were breath-taking, the acting was exceptional and made me feel that the actors knew that they were a part of something that transcended even their own acting skills.Jim Cavaziel portrayed Christ wonderfully. For the first time, I felt like I was seeing a middle eastern Jesus.As far as being violent.  Yes, it was violent.  His death was violent.  I will never again worship lightly, or fail to recognize the Glory of our Lord for what he went through on that cross.  I can only speak for myself, but by seeing The Passion I realized our complacent I had become in my faith.  I thought to myself...isn't it just like God to use Mel Gibson and the motion picture industry to bring revival to his Church.What an awesome reminder and wake up call.Open up the flood gates of Heaven, Lord._________________________By the way, I think that the official ""critics"" are missing their mark in their review of this film.  This is not a movie that was to visually, audibly, or mentally entertain us.",The Passion of the Christ
1620,MathaIsFlarge,this movie......,1,26 February 2004,"this film was pretty terrible, the only reason why it pulled emotion out of the people whom I saw it with was because of the base violence inflicted on Christ.  watching someone get viciously brutalized will stir your emotions and make you reflective -- but of course for all the wrong reasons, especially if events leading to the brutality, and if the brutality itself were fabricated. substance was lacking except for the fact that it was in Latin and in subtitles.  as a Brethren Christian, I felt betrayed watching this movie knowing that it wasn't true to the scriptures.  it also portrayed the Jews as animal like, which may ingrain in some minds a hatred of the Jews.  I give it a D.",The Passion of the Christ
1621,world_pilgrim,the word,10,21 January 2004,"This is not an easy movie to talk about. Even now, almost a week after the preview of Mel Gibson's latest and most controversial directorial effort, I find it very difficult to put into words that singular experience. And perhaps, silence, for a time, is an appropriate response. After the vast amount of speculation and debate generated by this film, surely some quiet contemplation cannot hurt.A quick glance through the various message boards below will suffice to show that much of what has been said is beside the point. The Passion of the Christ is a work of art. As with any piece of art, good or bad, it deserves to be experienced first, before being judged. This film is the fruit of one man's labour to bring to life what is arguably the most enduring story of all time. It is the stigma of our age that we do not handle 'religious-talk' well, but who says you need to be a believer to appreciate a good story? You just settle down and listen with an open mind and a willing heart. and allow for the possibility of a miracle.For this movie specifically, 'listening' does involve your faculties more than your auditory receptors. Not a single word is spoken in a language we can understand. This is a good thing. It enables us to hear the story quite literally for the first time. The use of both Aramaic and vernacular Latin by the actors demonstrate an underlying rift between the Jews and the Romans that is crucial to the way in which events ultimately play out. The first words spoken in The Passion are by Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane. Whether it was emotion talking or not, the phonological nuances of Aramaic to these virgin ears conveyed something, for lack of a better word, `guttural' (as in `from the gut')-- arising against resolve from the depth of one's being. Pontius Pilate's measured Latin, though met with contention and discord, nevertheless ground the proceedings in his courtyard with a sober tone of uncertainty as the Son of Man's fate hangs in the balance.Under any other circumstances, these alien tongues might have registered as merely noise. But, a familiar gaze, haunting and supplicating by turns, draws us in. For all the loud accusations and all the pitiless taunts, it is in the eyes of the actors that the profoundest moments find their mark. In them, you see the whole gamut of human emotions run their course, from agony to malice to guilt to resignation to mercy and forgiveness. You learn to look to Mary (Maia Morgenstern), his mother, because that is where the camera inevitably turns. Everything gravitates towards the stillness in her eyes. And we follow as she looks to her son, Jesus.Jim Caviezel has not a face that is easy to forget. When I met him this past summer, his eyes were a shocking shade of blue against dark hair and bronzed skin. But I could not see him in his role as the Christ at all. Underneath all the blood, I recognized only the noble form of a man. Various critics have already pointed out the graphic nature of this reenactment of Jesus' final hours. Nothing will prepare you for the scourging scene. As much as we have been desensitized to violence, something in us inevitably cries out against brutality. Reinforced by flashbacks to various stages of his life and ministry, Christ's humanity forces us to come to grips with what we bear witness to. When he is shackled and whipped to a bloody mess, you will not be able to shut your eyes. You will watch through the tears you cannot explain away, though you do not know this man.But there is no blame in this movie. You would have to be prejudiced and intent on finding fault with Mel Gibson's work before you even begin in order to find any trace of anti-Semitism in The Passion. Where there is good, there is also evil. And where there is despair, there is also hope. How you experience this movie is a personal choice.Blood, sweat, and tears-- it's all there, mingled into a lyrical work of passionate intensity. The Passion deserves to be seen on its own cinematic merits. Without any pretensions to the heroic, this is by far the bravest movie I have seen in a long, long time.At the time of viewing, the footage was not yet in its final edited cut, but it was enough.",The Passion of the Christ
1622,jj3,A+++,10,4 March 2004,"A very well done rendition of Jesus' crucifixion created by a Hollywood person who can actually think for himself. Critics be dammed. Both the directing and acting in this movie are superb. Anyone who says otherwise is silly and does not know their head from you know what!I've heard / read critics attempt to pick it apart like buzzards.  What a bunch of losers.  This story is taken from the Bible and history and is the account of the last hours of Jesus' life on earth done in fashion that Hollywood should be proud.I plan to see again at least once more in the theater and I'll also be buying the DVD.I think it would have been cool had he stuck with his initial plan to not have captions.With all due respect, a very good movie!

Everything in the film seems very realistic, from the whipping to the crucifying scene. I had to close my eyes a lot of times, I wanted it to stop. The scourging scene is the most intense for me I closed my eyes through most of it, it was too much to handle. James caviezel truly committed to this film and it shows, the rest of the cast adds truth to the film.
I truly hope that this film changes the way people think, it's worth seeing it. It is an inspiring film following the life of one of religion's most important figure.",The Passion of the Christ
1624,okayhill,A story of love,9,20 March 2004,"This was painful to see.  For me it visualized what I had heard about all my life.  Our Creator could not bear to live without us.  Even though I have to say this world seems as though we must be alone.  God has been in my life. I needed to come to the point my anger would take me to His face and say, ""I hate the pain and suffering in this world, why God?"" His reply, ""Can you forgive me, one day I will make it right?  One day I will return to you all you and everyone has lost and because of your faith and Jesus your Savior, I will elevate you to Family.""  When I walked out of this movie all I could think of was ""AMAZING GRACE"" This is truly a love story. I believe many will find the good in this movie. I also believe many will find fault.

1625,srchapeu,Simply Unnecessary!,1,31 March 2004,"I've just came back from the cinema and the only conclusion that I could get from this movie is that Mel Gibson is a genius. Not a genius on making movies, but on create polemic around it only just to attract audience. Nothing in this movie makes sense. The soundtrack is a crap, the violence showed is unnecessary, nothing is explained during the two hours of film, and after these two hours, you can't catch any message of love you could expect('His message was love', on the teaser). I reccomend this film only for those who are thirsty for blood, and are tired of seeing Ultimate Fighting championships. Sorry by my poor English, but I had to give my opinion.",The Passion of the Christ
1626,ConservativeCoppolaFan,My take on one of the most powerful films ever created,10,26 February 2004,"Spoilers. Like you don't know what it's about anyway.When you see a movie that's done so unbelievably well, in this case a film about Jesus, It doesn't matter what religion you are or if you actually believe in the events taking place. Let me start by saying Mel Gibson definitely had a vision in making this film, enough to pay $20-30 million of his own money to make it. I stood with him in the making of this film and I stand with him after it has been released, I have a deep amount of respect for him and I'm glad he didn't sacrifice his vision because Hollywood wouldn't buy it.Why you should see this film: So many people bitch and complain about movies being unoriginal or lame and contain absolutely no effect on you whatsoever. Then when a movie like this comes out you complain that it's either too violent or that it could possibly be offensive. Even if you think it could be offensive I think you should take this movie as a challenge instead of an insult from Mel Gibson and go see it. It's so rare today that we get a movie that's powerful like this that when we do we should celebrate it. not mourn it.After viewing this film I find it hard for anyone to be watching this film and not be emotionally impacted by what it's showing you. Sure we've all heard the story numerous times, but this time it meant something to me. I felt a sort of odd emotion I usually don't pick up when viewing movies. That tells me it was done well. The visualization and sequences in this film were all set flawlessly. The film itself is perfect. I can't think of anything I'd take out or want to change.While driving home the only thing that I could think about was comparing this one with other films that have impacted me so deeply. Every movie seemed so mediocre or empty to me at the time, this movie leaves a sort of odd trance over you like you've just seen one of the greatest movies ever made. I encourage you to see this movie on those means too because I know others have had the same feeling in this area so I know I'm not alone. Hopefully you will agree emotionally and mentally.When you walk into this movie I hope you are doing it for yourself and not for others. Don't see this movie on terms that it is for or against your specific religion. Don't see this movie on terms that it's all anti-Semitic propaganda. Walk into the theater with an open mind and ignore all of that political bulls**t. Even if you're an atheist you should see the movie just the way you view it as, a simple story. In this case it's a story done well. Just give this movie a shot and don't be a hothead about it, if you go into the theater without an open mind chances are you will walk out thinking what you thought before you walked in. (Whether that's good or bad)
This movie also has started my revolt against Hollywood. I'm disgusted with what I've seen from them lately, and to imagine them turning this movie down because it's legitimate in the events that the bible said fills me with hatred for them. Hollywood would have loved to re-write the bible, just like they loved Martin Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST; where they made Jesus sinful. As long as we don't offend anybody and fabricate the s**t out of it it's ok, right? Wrong.The acting in this film is phenomenal. James Caviezel is extraordinary; his acting in every scene is completely realistic, thoroughly acted out and very precise. Maia Morgenstern stood out as well, very well done. The language in this film is done well; I was very pleased that there wasn't English in the film. It left more of a reality to the film. I also don't understand what peoples problem with reading subtitles is, it's not that hard and you have the picture right there for it. Lazy.The rest of the acting was done well too; every character in this film was taken into perspective. The directing of this film is done so well, every frame of this movie is well acted, beautifully shot, realistic in every way, and emotional. The music to this film (John Debney) is perfect; besides the theme 'Simon Is Dismissed' [Track 07]. That was a little obnoxious and even in the film I felt it could have been replaced with another theme and still have the effect being shot for.There were certain things about the movie that seem so perfect no matter how acute they are. Take for instance, the way Mel shot Satan. Rosalinda Celentano lurking around in the background, with a stale mono face and pale white skin. Completely ominous to the point where you would shiver. The movie is so vivid in certain areas it's like you're watching these events actually take place. The flashbacks are all perfectly timed; to the point where you might as well have been sitting in a 9 hour movie. Mel successfully has significant scenes which occurred before the last 12 hours of Christ fitted in to perfection; the feel of the film is incredible.
When it comes down to it, I loved this film. I could watch it over and over again. Emotionally and visually this film is stunning in every way. When I think of a good movie, this is what I think of. A movie I can't get out of my head after I've first scene it. Movies like this give me hope for the future in film, since lately we've been seeing nothing but shit. So yes, I loved this movie and I highly recommend it. It's on my Top 10 list as #3. See it.Aside from all of that there will be people who won't concur in the ways that I have drawn this film out to be such a great accomplishment. There are those who will argue with facts that they could never prove, those who will still be clouded with the films 'anti-Semitic' views (morons), and of course those who just thing it's Mel exploiting the final hours of Christ for money. I can't change those views and I won't try too, I can only offer you mine.I personally did not see any kind of attitude from anyone in reviews that they're 'better' than anyone else for making this movie. I feel Mel was more passionate with this film than anyone else would have been and I'm glad that he did it. You can question everything all day with this film, argue it to nothing and tear it apart with your arrogant and imbecilic views. But alas, by the end of the day you will be unfulfilled with this films powerful impact if you're going to view it as such a degrading piece of cinema. The jokes on you motherfucker.And remember, at all costs I recommend this film. I do not feel it was excessive in any areas with the violence and I especially do not feel that it was abhorrent to the point where the film is blasphemous. I wouldn't put such a high recommendation on this film if I wasn't so sure anyone could like it, so once again I highly suggest you see it. Challenge yourself to see a good film for a change. I'm sure it will stand out well since all you've been doing is watching garbage for the past 3 years. Ciao.",The Passion of the Christ

1628,The_Humble_Templar,What words cannot say...,10,1 March 2004,"A Review of The Passion of the Christ,-By David W.I went to see this movie yesterday(Feb. 28th)with the belief that Jesus is the Christ. So my review is most definately bias. The hype of this movie led me to believe this movie was going to be extreme, one way or the other.I sat in my seat calmly and full of anticipation, and disturbed at the number of children(between 8 and 12)sitting in the theatre withe their parents, as if what they were about too see was a family picnic.The movie opens up with a heart-wrenching scene of Jesus crying and praying to God, in the garden, for strength and courage. Satan comes to Him and tries to discourage Him from the path He is about to take. But the Lord finds courage in His Father, and resists the devils tamptaions once again, by dramacticly stomping on a snakes head(fufilling a prophesy from Genisis)The next hour is full of moving imagery and masterful stroytelling, on Mr.Gibson's part. A hurtful betrayl, a saddening denial, and a kangaroo court proceeding. The violence is brutal and gut-wrenching, but necessary. As an audience, we have too understand what Jesus went through. The scourging scene, made me break into tears.Finally after being tortured and beaten, He is crucified, and slowly dies. Even in the end He prays for Caiaphus and all those who took part in His execution, begging His Father to forgive them. This speaks highly of our Lords true charater, and shows He is who He says He is. Jesus ""practiced what He so passionately preached."" As Jesus dies and is lowered from the cross, He just lies in His mothers arms, and she stares directly at the camrea and to the audience, with a look that speaks louder than any word, in any language, ever could.Then the stone rolls away and our Lord Jesus stands in triumph and victory. And so ends one of the greatest movies ever made by any man!",The Passion of the Christ
1629,moka_ok,"""The Passion of the Christ"" is not in itself anti-Semitic",10,27 February 2004,"A narrow-minded may take Gibson's depiction of the Jewish priests of the Sanhedrin maneuvering for Christ's execution as incitement, but ""The Passion"" is not in itself anti-Semitic. There's enough sin to go around, and Gibson spreads it liberally:While Pilate (Hristo Naumov Shopov) is depicted as a harried branch manager for the Roman Empire trying to stave off an uprising, his centurions come off as bloodthirsty apes. Who's responsible for Christ's death? We all are, says Gibson, and proceeds to rub our noses in it. ""The Passion"" is very powerful, Gibson has created the most visually realistic re-creation yet of the Stations of the Cross -- with subtitled dialogue in Latin and Aramaic and a few heavy-handed ""artistic"" touches daubed on. For sure ""The Passion"" is a must-see movie and maybe a spiritual milestone...",The Passion of the Christ
1630,muretta123,blood blood blood and more blood,6,25 February 2004,"The Passion was a great movie but the violence and gore and blood destroy the enjoyment.  i have seen pretty much all of the most violent movies in Hollywood. and this is more intense,violent, bloody, and sick to ur stomach kind of a movie than all of then combine! i was almost crying cause i wanted to leave so bad, the violence and toture was way tooooo much for me! its alot to endure! dont go on and empty stomach or you might throw up like i almost did. its rated R for a good reason so please see it before u take ur kids! Mel Gibson really got his point across and to think this all ""happend"". it was unbelievably disturbing! but the story was well told and deserves all the reginition that it has been getting. the man that played Jesus did an awesome job. oh and the whole movie is in Latin  so be perpaired to read subtitles!",The Passion of the Christ
1631,sapphiresteele2003,View with an open mind,10,28 February 2004,"Its very difficult to view this film with an open mind with all the criticism surrounding it.One good thing about the media's coverage of this film, is that by the time I went to see it, I was prepared for a very sobering and sombre experience. After all, it IS about the Crucifixion of Christ. There's nothing beautiful about this fact. Gibson's film offers to us a mere glimpse of what might have taken place. Indeed, the torture He actually received might have been worse than what was portrayed in the film. Yes, it is bloody and violent, hence the R rating, as its not for very young viewers, although when you think of the violent video games kids play nowadays EVERYDAY, its ironic that there's an uproar about The Passion's violence. Unlike Ben-Hur, The Silver Chalice, Quo Vadis and the Scarlett Robe which all in my view simple concentrated on the beauty of the actors, Gibson offers as realistic as possible an account of what might have taken place, which was back then a haunting, horrifying and bone chilling. The film will drain you emotionally and it will linger in your psyche for day after, the same way Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan did to me after I watched them. The reason these films impact so much on our psyche is because the stories are real and the visual and sound effects seem very realistic. If the violence was unnecessary, I can think of other films where violence or steamy screens were unnecessary like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Desperado, Halle Berry's Oscar winning performance for screwing an old racist guy in Monster's Ball, Michael Douglas in Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct. I see the blood and the agony shown in the film as Gibson's message that here it is Christ went through all of this pain, agony and suffering for us as human beings. He could have saved himself quite easily by denying his faith and God as His Father but He didn't, he took ALL of that beating and suffering for US! That is why it is called the Ultimate Sacrifice. I believe that Gibson wants us to do a lot of introspection into who we really are and how we behave as so-called human beings. I've watched far more disturbing films, which to me lost the 'good over evil' plot like The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby and The Omen. I know of two women who went into labour while watching The Exorcist, and a man died of a heart attack. These films are so called 'cult' films, which didn't seem to get as much negative publicity as The Passion. Why is that? Why are some members of Dreamworks saying they would never work with Gibson again? Maybe its because these guys are biased as they are Jewish, and may believe that Gibson is making a personal attack against them, when in my view, it is them who have made it personal. Are they not going to work with the woman who plays Jesus's mother too? After all she's Jewish! Its all very sad yet very enlightening that human beings would behave in this way about something rather simple, like a movie!",The Passion of the Christ
1632,rustone1,Sadistic and Brutal,3,6 February 2004,"True to form, Mel Gibson loves sadism, brutality and violence. This is Braveheart minus the lengthy disembowelment of Wallace. This movie is not uplifting but sickening. Much of the four Gospels are contradictory and based on non-witnesses to the life of Christ (Neither Mark, Matthew, Luke or John were apostles of Jesus or witnesses to the crucifixion), Gibson has picked and chosen only the most sadistic version of John which was written 100 years after the death of Jesus. I have trouble believing what the New York Times wrote two days ago let alone 2,000 years ago. The Gospels were edited. reedited hundreds of times by hundreds of Churchmen who designed it to absolved the Romans and blame the Jews for the death of a Jew who all Christianity now worships.How Gibson determined that the graphic, sadistic beating and torturing of Jesus was supposed to evoke love for all mankind is beyond comprehension. The portrayal of the Passion is not new. Christian countries, especially in Eastern Europe used it before Easter to initiate pogroms against the Jews. The love Jesus was supposed to convey to mankind was twisted by the Church and culminated in the Holocaust, a Christian sponsored event induced by such propaganda as Gibson's Passion. One need not have any doubts of Gibson's motivation as he and his father belong to the radical Catholic Church which refuses to agree with the Pope's absolvement of Jews killing of Christ.Gibson's frenzied recent television interview blamed scapegoats. ""They"" are driving me out of Hollywood"" said Gibson. He constantly used the word ""they"" in the negative sense, meaning ""Jews"". The softball clergy interviewer never asked him about his affiliation with his Church which opposes reconciliation with Jews, nor his father's recent anti Semitic outbursts. One might have asked him why no prominent Jews were allowed to review his movie, but that too would be asking too much.",The Passion of the Christ
1633,jesusfreak96-274-169681,Has Mel Gibson read his Bible carefully?,6,22 November 2013,"To preface this review, I come from a conservative Protestant background. I take the Bible at face value. I believe that the Bible is God's inspired word to His creation, and I believe His son Jesus came and died for the sins of the world.Now about this film.Solely from a film perspective, it's pretty good. Jim Caviezel does a good job portraying Jesus. The setting is good, and believable. You have a heightened sense of realism in that all dialogue is in the original Hebrew, or Aramaic, I'm not sure the exact language, but regardless, it's the native language of the characters.But that's not where I find fault with this movie.First, Jesus did not encounter Satan in the Garden of Gethsemane. Nowhere in the Bible is that describedSecondly, the beating Jesus receives are overly graphic and thoroughly unrealistic. He would have been dead long before he got to the cross with that kind of beating.Third, the emphasis on Mary is extreme and unwarranted. There is this constant tension between Mary and Satan, as if they're somehow warring and fighting over Jesus' soul. Mary was simply the vessel that God used to bring Jesus into the world. Yes, he was her oldest son, and I have no doubts that she was a firm believer in His message, but she did not have some sort of supernatural sway over Jesus. That is what is portrayed in this movie.Finally, we are subjected to this horribly graphic beating and crucifixion, and then we only get six seconds of the resurrection? That is what the Christian faith is all about! This was a decent movie but all in all I must recommend the Gospel of John over it.",The Passion of the Christ
1634,dementedbear,The Gospel according to Gibson,3,16 April 2006,"So here we are, Easter 2006, two years on from the release of Mel Gibson's highly controversial ""Passion of the Christ"". I've just finished watching this film for the second time as my parents had yet to see it, (my first viewing being on release), and have truly seen the light. So to speak. What an awful film.The first and rather big problem I have with this film is the way in which it was handled at the box office, particularly in the American ""bible-belt"" territory. The film was given such precedence and publicity, mainly due to the overwhelming support from Christian fundamentalists that it ran for a number of weeks at almost every theatre. This wouldn't be such a problem if the embrace of this propaganda was not so one sided; films such as the recent Brokeback Mountain are almost banned in some States to largely Christian opposition to Liberal agendas.Admittedly this isn't Gibson's fault, or any fault on the films part. What I do find hypocritical is the manner in which this film was given such prominence, despite Gibson's earlier films, many of which contain violence, sex, swearing etc. This is still propaganda. It would be foolish to claim films don't aim to trick, persuade and lie. That's the very essence of film.Anyway, the film itself. As a film this is a pretty poor piece of celluloid. The acting is moderate at best and the violence is so gratuitously graphic you have to wonder about the mentality of the makers. Defenders of the film claim this level of violence is paramount into portraying the suffering of Christ. But the manner in which it is filmed troubles me if indeed a Christian message is to be conveyed. The actual dwelling on pain, excessive gore, gleefully sadistic guards and use of shots (over-used close-ups of whips with barbed bone flecks) almost add a sexual, masochistic dimension to the film. It's like any other sub-bar horror flick. Think of ""Hostel"" for example. The violence is so horrific it's a painful task to actually force yourself through watching this. A previous reviewer said many times they felt like turning away - but didn't. Gibson almost makes one feel guilty for looking away, a kind of taunt seemingly saying we can't handle the truth, when in fact you cannot be blamed for not wanting to watch.Almost like forcing yourself through Catholic penance.This would be justified I feel if Gibson juxtaposed these horrific scenes of torture with the loving message and acts Jesus commits in the gospels. This I feel is what is so unforgivable; a film that claims to accurately depict Jesus last hours has no spiritual dimension and no message of love, compassion and peace preached by Jesus. Going back to my previous comments, this creates the feeling of a vacuous horror flick.The Roman guards, Jews and crowd are all ridiculous two-dimensional ciphers designed to generate added feelings of pathos to the Christ character. Who is fairly badly acted and seen only as a mute covered in excessive amounts of prosthetics, latex and fake gore and is fairly two-dimensional himself. As far as film icons go Gibson does nothing to add to the archetypal ""Jesus figure"". Still long hair, delicate face and white skin. When most likely he would have looked exactly like any other Jew. The complex emotional and spiritual nature of this man is all but erased.Gibson also claimed that this excessive ultra-violence and the use of original languages such as Hebrew and Aramaic equal reality. Not so. The script is poor at best, lacking any subtlety and nuance, and the forgein intones only add to the wooden stilted dialogue. To quote critic Peter Bradshaw, ""allegedly, blood plus dead language equals reality"".I don't think so.The reason this film gets three stars not less, is it is generally technically proficient. But other than that we are treated to a poorly shot, poorly acted film in which any Christian message or notion of Jesus as a walking, breathing, thinking human is savagely destroyed like Jim Caveizel's body. The various demonic apparitions that pop up in various places are absurd, and any power the scenes of violence have on the audience are undermined by the ridiculous sentimentality of the end.Essentially the film does nothing to appeal to non-belivers. The whole reason behind Jesus brutal death is left totally unexplored and the actual ""facts"" are only Gibson's brand of strict Catholicism. But at least Mel has faith. Just how much was that you made huh?",The Passion of the Christ
1635,dischooley,"A Superb Film, Amazing Performance by Jim Caviezel",9,1 February 2012,"Hello Readers,After watching this film, I felt compelled to sit down and write this review, no matter how long it took. I was in awe. It is my true belief that this film SHOULD be viewed by every American, no matter what religious background they come from. This film is near perfect and I found it near impossible to come up with any cons.pros: - The historic authenticity of the film is near unrivaled. Historically accurate engravings are shown on Roman Centurion armor. The entire film is spoken in the real languages. The Romans speak Latin, and the Hebrews speak Aramaic. Pontius Pilate is shown as the truly good man he was. He has a severe moral dilemma presented to him, and he tries his best to save Jesus' life, but in the end he gives the order to have Christ crucified, to avoid a riot or civil revolt.The acting is superb on all levels by all actors and actresses. You really feel drawn into the film, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.Many people consider the extreme violence of The Passion of the Christ to take away from it's message. I wholeheartedly disagree. It actually makes up a large part of the films message. A key part of this film is to give viewers a realistic look into the last 12 hours of Christ's life. In real life, he WAS brutally beaten with barbed Cat o' nine tails, nailed clubs and bamboo switches. He did bleed profusely, and HE DID SWEAT BLOOD at the Garden of Gethsemane. All of this was done to an innocent man.Cons: - I tried very very hard, and I could only really find one con. When you see the Devil walking through the crowd about mid way through the film, he is holding a strange, pale, very disturbing baby. If I was supposed to understand something I guess I didn't. I just think that the film doesn't do a good job of explaining the infant.Overall, this film is a superb portrayal of the final 12 hours of Christ's life, and is more of a history lesson than a sermon. But then again, that depends on what you believe!",The Passion of the Christ
1636,champ914,Great movie,10,9 February 2004,"I watched a private screening of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and would recommend that everyone should see this movie.  Set aside the fact that it portrays perhaps the most endearing love story in history, this film is an incredible piece of art.  this is not a film that you forget about. The audience of about 4,000 watched this screening and when the film ended all 4,000 people exited the building without saying a word.  no one asked us to be quiet, we were just dismissed.  Something about watching this film takes your words away.  You just have to be silent.  Great Movie",The Passion of the Christ
1637,synrgy,"Answering those who say ""Where's the Love"" in the movie",10,24 February 2004,"I'm probably among the first paying-audience in the world to see The Passion on 25 February, since the international time zones mean that it's still the 24th in the U.S. -- Australia is a day ahead of the U.S.I myself am a stoic and not a terribly emotional person, and am rarely if ever moved emotionally by movie-violence at the level of Braveheart, Terminator, Last Samurai etc. The violence in The Passion, however, hit me at a level I'm unused to--at the heart level. I felt my body rise and ebb and cry, bypassing any thoughts at the mind-level. As many reviewers have said, The Passion is experienced, rather than watched.Now, I see a trend in the professional reviews questioning, ""Where's the love of the Christian message?""These reviewers miss the point of the Gospel.There are two parts to the Christian message--the secular reviewers are mixing up the first and the second points of the two-part Christian message.The first part of the Christian message is that mankind is intrinsically sinful i.e. hate, selfish, greedy, wars, immoral, lying, conceited, prejudice, and most of all, self-righteous etc. Because all of us sin, we all deserve eternal separation from God.The brutality of The Passion is a graphic display of our own sin. All the sin of mankind was concentrated on the body of the innocent Christ as a ""sacrificial lamb"".My guess is that all those professional movie reviewers who say ""Where's the love"" in all that violence, haven't come to terms with their own sinfulness.As I see it, here's the take home message to the professional movie reviewers who couldn't see where the love is in the movie: - God's love is shown in that, if a person accepts Jesus as Saviour, then that person is saved from having to go through the same suffering for eternity.Consider this: if the Christian message is correct (and there's a good chance that it is), then, if one does not accept Christ's sacrifice, then the sort of suffering in the movie will be your destiny for eternity. i.e. if you don't accept Christ taking it for you, then you receive it by default.Some readers might say that's a load of hogwash, but if there is a 50-50 chance that the Gospel is right, it might pay you to take 1 hour, sometime in your lifetime, to read the Gospels and New Testament and decide for yourself. Imagine dismissing the Gospel without reading it, as many have criticized The Passion without seeing it first.The second part of the Gospel is that, Father God loves you so much, that He does not want YOU to go through that kind of suffering for eternity, so He put it on Jesus. (John 3:16).That's where the love is.",The Passion of the Christ
1638,supers_junk,its personal,10,24 February 2004,"As are most things involving faith (or lack thereof), this movie is intensely personal.  I can certainly see how someone might consider this movie too violent, while others may see it as anti-Jewish.  Still others may see it as a far-right plot to destroy civilization - I don't know.  Lots of points of view out there, and most them color the picture.My point of view is that of a Christian - a critical-thinking, evangelical Christian.  And, based on what I've heard from Mel Gibson, I believe that I saw the film much as he intended - as an indictment against MY sin (not the Jews), and as a reminder of HIS willing sacrifice.  While watching the film, the main thing that was going through my head was ""I'll never stop being a sinner, but because of this, this act of perfect love, I'm redeemed. Thank you Jesus.""Yes, it is very violent.  Yes, there are some things in the movie which remind you that it is, after all, a movie.  But for the millions and millions who comes from my point of view (evangelical Christian), this film will probably be the most intense, the most powerful, and the most important thing they'll ever see.  It will certainly cause me to evaluate my relationship with Christ, and I hope it does the same for you.",The Passion of the Christ
1639,packofrogs,Great symbolic line...,10,25 February 2004,"I don't know the exact quote, but I thought the line delivered by the man that was forced to carry Jesus' cross, ""I want everyone to remember that I am an innocent man forced to carry the cross for this convicted man, though I have committed no sin..."" was wonderfully subtle symbolism of what the sacrifice of Jesus is all about. Jesus is the innocent man forced to carry the burden for us. Obviously there are many things that everyone will pick apart about this movie, such as what should have been put into it and what should have been omitted, but the subject matter is such that the movie could have been 10,124 minutes long, not 124. In conclusion the the movie is good and serves its purpose to illustrate the depths of the sacrifice. It doesn't have enough of Jesus' teachings to convert, but for those that believe it leaves you with the goal of trying to be worthy of such Passion.",The Passion of the Christ

I think its kinda sad that they were let down because they werent enough blood and really didnt get the message. I am not the one who usuly sheds a tear in a movie, but i admit seeing that kind of suffering really made me shed more than a few. No man, even the son of god, should pay that price for anyone sins. Please dont go to this movie for the violence but to see for yourself what our lord did for us and NEVER forget it again.

1641,artistusa2004,Gibson's Braveheart Passion,1,22 February 2004,"If you could stomach the disembowelment scene in Braveheart you may be prepared for the sadistic beating Jesus endured in Passion. Gibson's motivation for this prolonged and sickening torture scene are numerous. Gibson won an Oscar for his direction of Braveheart and the lenghty graphic disembowelment scene of Wallace won the hearts of the Oscar committee.Also the overdone scourging scene confirms that Jesus must have died, if not for the short 3-4 hours on the cross, but the shock of the beating itself. The Gospel of John was the only Gospel to indicate that Jesus was pierced with a spear to offset the other Gospels which indicated that Pilate was incredulous that Jesus died so soon. The other men(robbers) on the cross were not dead and had to have their legs broken to be taken down with Jesus before the Sabbath. Death by crucifixion can take days to die.Although Gibson claims to have been faithful to the Gospels it is believed by most biblical scholars that none of them were written by associates of Jesus and John was not even Jewish, but a Greek, who knew nothing about Jewish customs or religion.  The same was true of converted Gentile Paul, who never met Jesus and was opposed by Peter and James(Jesus brother) in his attempt to change their Jewish Nazarene sect into a Hellenic pagan religion. The Eucharist scene of the Last Supper was inserted into the Gospels to conform with Paul's visions It is doubtful that Jesus would refer to the wine and bread as his blood and body respectively as that is more of a pagan rite. None of the Nazarene or followers of Peter and James observed the custom and they, not Paul, were associates of Jesus and knew what he wanted.Gibson claimed that he is not anti Semitic, yet he took the most anti Semitic segments of the Gospels to devise his script. He admitted that he also used the dreams of an anti Semitic nun, Anne Emmerich to add a little sadism to the plot. He also stated that those non believers are ""dupes of Satan."" Which is also a standard for some brands of Christianity. You are either with them or against them. In Gibson's Traditionalist Catholic church the Pope never should have forgiven the Jews and the Holocaust was a minor event. When asked about the Holocaust Gibson replied that ""Yeah, Jews died and so did a lot of Christians."" In a later interview he changed his story and admitted that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust which was aided and abetted by Christian European society. No doubt many influenced by age old Passion plays which involked riots and pogroms.Jim Caviezel, did a marvelous job acting but should have religious concerns himself in his dubious role of Jesus, being struck by lightning while on the cross. Not even Cecil B DeMille could bring down the wrath of the heavens in his biblical Moses scenes.",The Passion of the Christ

If you look at the rating that people are giving the movie so far then you will see that it has a 7.4 rating out of 10 so basically the average person likes it and if you are like the average person you will like it to or at least give it a 7.4 rating.

1643,dolany7,The Greatest Story Ever Told,10,28 February 2004,"I thought this film was absolutely breathtaking.  I happen to be a Catholic, so I have an even greater appreciation for the passion of Christ now, but you can really be any religion and still be affected by this film. There was, of course, a great deal of highly publicised gore and violence, but if you think about it rationally, that's probably how it really happened.  There were a lot of very powerful emotions present as well, Jesus struggling with the truth of what was going to happen to him, Mary suffering as her son is brutally tortured and killed and the hatred that drove the Jewish priests and Roman soldiers to the acts that they committed that day. For anyone that has seen the classic film, ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" there was a lot more violence, and I generally would not recommend that smaller children or anyone who is very sensitive see this film. To dispell the various notions of Anti-Semitism or Anti-Italianism that people may feel or have heard of; Jesus, Mary, John, Mary Magadalene, Veronica, Simon, Claudia and Pilate were the only characters portrayed in a a positive light.  The Jewish Sanhedrin and the Roman soldiers were very brutal, and would have been that bent on destroying his Word (The Sanhedrin) and just as sadistic (the soldiers).  Anyone who has read the passion stories in Matthew, Mark, Luke or John will realise that Mel Gibson's story follows the Bible quite well. I thought the movie was fantastic, although I did cry for most of it, I feel better about life and faith, and I encourage anyone who can stomach the terrible scenes of agony, to go see this film.",The Passion of the Christ

To the best of my understanding this film accurately portraits an historic event and gives you a front and center spot for one of the most controversial times in human history.  Wars have been faught over peoples interpretation of this event and Gibson leaves you feeling like you were an eye witness to the whole event.

1646,nitanarr,"A missed opportunity: Gratuitous graphic violence, paper-thin characters, mediocre acting",2,21 February 2004,"I was invited to a screening of ""The Passion"" which was run by New Zealand's Chief Censor to get a feel for public reaction -- the film has subsequently been rated R16.  Some fuss was made before the showing that thanks to the vagaries of international time zones, New Zealand would be the first country in the world in which this film would be officially shown.In many ways, I'm sorry I went.  Mel Gibson has missed a number of big opportunities with this film.The film's storyline runs from Jesus's betrayal by Judas through to the crucifixion, with an additional 10 seconds or so on the resurrection.  In essence, after the first 10 minutes, the film is one long, excruciating torture scene.  The violence is displayed with a disturbing degree of graphic detail.  Admittedly, I've never witnessed torture or crucifixion first hand, but I felt that the details (spurting blood etc) were rather exaggerated - some of the antics would have been more at home in one of Peter Jackson's early films.  I would not recommend this film for anyone with a weak stomach, or children or adolescents.  Essentially, if you wouldn't go see a death sentence being executed, don't go see this film.I suspect that this film's most enthusiastic audiences will be from people with a penchant for violence, and that it will send `the wrong message' to such people.  The scant dialog in the film is in Aramaic, Latin, and Biblical Hebrew.  I suspect the actors didn't have to work terribly hard to get their lines out well.  There is very little by way of exposition of Jesus's message to the world; the focus is rather on the pain and suffering that were inflicted.  Even Mary is underdeveloped as a character, with Gibson resorting to sentimental flashbacks of Jesus-as-child to try to jerk more tears from us.Both the Jews and Romans are caricatured far more than necessary, and little is done to explore the Jewish and Roman characters.  The exception to this is Pontius Pilate, who is given a sympathetic treatment.I couldn't help but compare this film to Lord of the Rings; Jesus as Gandalf, the disciples as hobbits, Romans as Elves, Jews as Orcs, Pilate as Saruman, Caiaphas as Wormtongue.  Only the plot was much more straightforward, the acting far worse, the scenery non-existent, and any message of hope and/or love for the human race was lost in a sea of violence.If this film had been about anyone other than Jesus, even any person who had died being tortured for reasons of religious persecution, it would never receive any notice.  I don't recommend it, and be forewarned: content may disturb.",The Passion of the Christ

She loved her son so much and yet she gave him up so that we might live.  And the scene after his death when she holds him, beautiful.  I bawled when she went to her son after he fell and he tells her that he comes to make all things new. Satan is well done, and made me scared.  When I came home, I cried myself to sleep thanking God for loving me so much.  Thank you so much Mel for making a movie that left my spirit weeping.",The Passion of the Christ
1648,jantal1,"An act of faith, not entertainment",6,23 February 2004,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is an intense cinematic experience. It is also an anomaly: a mainstream movie that is an exposition of religious dogma, expounding the basic tenets of Christian faith. With fervent conviction, the filmmakers are telling us that Christ, the son of God, took on the sins of the world in order to purchase salvation; he suffered and died to expiate those sins, and he rose again from the dead, thereby conquering death for humanity. It is the kind of unselfconscious Biblical moviemaking that we haven't seen since the days of The Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur in the late 1950's and early 1960's. But this isn't a swords-and-sandals spectacle. It is essentially an act of faith, not a work of entertainment, and it is impossible to review it as a typical Hollywood release. Religious faith is passionately subjective, and true believers dichotomize between good and evil with unflinching conviction.  Because of this dogmatism, and because so much has changed in the social consciousness in the past forty years, it is a movie that no one will approach dispassionately. Christians already know and believe in the story, people of other faiths, or no faith, will see it as fiction, fable or superstition; mythologists will see it as another example of the martyr king sacrificed to ensure the fertility of the crops and the prosperity of the people. Like any statement of unwavering faith, this movie evokes belief, doubt, mockery, hatred, derision and divisiveness.The film follows the Gospel story of the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus, from his agonizing and lonely nighttime hours in Gethsemane as he anticipated his arrest, to his torture and crucifixion. It is the period of time the Catholic Church celebrates as the Stations of the Cross, a round of meditations and prayers traditional to Lent, the period of fasting and abnegation preceding the Easter time celebration of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. As such, this movie will make excellent instructional material for Christian bible and confirmation classes, so long as the viewers are reasonably mature. It may also help to make some converts. In these cases, the movie is preaching to the choir, dramatizing in the most excruciating detail the last passion of Christ and the true extent of his sacrifice and suffering. (In Christian terminology, passion denotes suffering or ordeal.) For many Christians who grew up in the faith, the crucifixion has become a tired symbol of suffering long past. This movie brings it back in all its horror and immediacy. Every torment suffered by Christ is depicted graphically and at length. His scourging is delivered by two brutal, drunken Roman soldiers who flay his back, then flip him over to do the front, with the mechanical efficiency of a couple of window washers. When he is nailed to the cross, the same system applies: the soldiers hammer nails into his hands and feet, then flip the cross over with a heartrending crash to secure the nails to the wood. (For some reason, the producers place the nails in the traditional places: the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, rather than following current research, which places them in the wrists and ankles.) We hear every blow and groan, see ever gobbet of torn flesh, hear every drop of blood. This is the story of Christ produced for an audience that is neither easily impressed nor easily moved.For non-Christians, the movie may be instructive; it may also be an ordeal. It is unrelentingly violent, disturbing and sad. Mary is seen following her son every step of the way, tormented and almost mute, from his scourging to the crucifixion on Calvary, finally standing at the foot of the cross with her face stained with her son's blood; Christ's disciples betray and abandon him; the mob spits on him and kicks him when he falls under the weight of the cross. To Christians, these are essential elements of Christ's story. To non-Christians, the whole story may look bloody, barbaric and senseless.
In the way of most Hollywood dramas, the villains are painted very black indeed. The Jewish high priests are spiteful, pitiless and mean. We see this stereotypical characterization often in film depictions of religious bigots: pitiless Catholic cardinals burning the heretical scientist Giordano Bruno at the stake, pitiless Spanish inquisitors, pitiless Spanish conquistadors and pitiless Puritans burning witches, to name a few. The Romans receive no better treatment. No one fares very well in this movie except Christ, his mother, (St.) John, Mary Magdalene and a few Jews who take pity on Christ as he carries the cross up to his execution place.Visually, the film is overcast with fog, dust, and threatening clouds. The soundtrack sometimes consists of haunting pipe music, sometimes overly reverential church music. The dialogue is in Aramaic and Latin with subtitles, but since dialogue is sparse, this doesn't create a problem with continuity. In fact, it's fun to hear Latin spoken by tough Roman soldiers. Jim Caviezel, who has looked saintly in earlier roles (The Thin Red Line, Angel Eyes), makes a strong and tormented Christ.Recommended for one viewing. Like other movies, (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List), one viewing may last a lifetime.",The Passion of the Christ
1649,dprtheswitch,Greatest Witnessing Tool Ever!,10,26 February 2004,"I have to say that when I saw this movie I wasn't sure what to expect. Although the film had been seen as controversial, I don't consider my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ controversial.  One thing that some critics would label the movie is that it is Anti-Jew or Anti-Semitic. Not so. One thing that alot of critics fail to realize is that Christ was not persecuted by one particular person or group, WE ARE ALL responsible for the death of Christ! It was in God's plan that this was to happen, for Him to die for our sins was God's plan the whole time.  Jesus didn't wake up one day and decide ""Maybe I'll die for the sin of mankind"". No, it was in the Will of God. The movie depicts the last twelve hours of Christ's life very well and as for the graphicness of the movie, it is necessary.  Mel Gibson has done a great job in bringing the story of Jesus' last hours to the screen. I went home that night and compared the movie to scripture in my Bible (KJV) and it was close enough. Now seeing the movie doesn't replace reading the Bible, but it gives you a visualization of what Christ went through and I know as a Christian it opened my eyes wider to see just how much our Savior went through. It was a very emotional, yet at the same time educational to those who have seen it.  I wouldn't recommend the movie to just anyone though. It is rated R for graphic violence, so little kids shouldn't go and see it just yet.  The one-liner from the movie that I like the most was in one of His flashbacks during the Last Supper, ""I am the way, the truth and the life, no man comes to the father but by me"", referring to John 14:6. Great movie, great witnessing tool, a must see. Not just for Christians, but also for those who don't know truly how much Jesus did for us. May any who view this movie take something away and positively apply it to their lives. And like alot of books in the Bible end, May the grace of Jesus Christ be with you all.

Gibson has done a fantastic job of portraying the betrayal, conviction, and crucifiction of Christ.The accounts as far as I can tell from my reading of the Gospels are extremely accurate.  Being that Gibson is Catholic, there are of course numerous symbols that he used that are primarily derived from the Catholic dogma, but these seem to enhance the film.  Nothing is anti-doctrinal.  He does take some poetic liscense, as in portraying Satan, but this also seems to add to the film.I saw the movie in a jam packed theater, and with the exception of crying, all 400 some people were silent the entire movie.  You could really tell that everyone of every faith in the theater was completely drawn into the film.  Gibson did a fantastic job of transporting the audience into the time and place of the actual events.The images shown on the screen were very shocking.  I have been moved while reading the accounts of Jesus' last week on the earth, but I have never felt the way I did seeing it portrayed in such a way.

I say this word experienced because when you view this movie, you cannot just view it - It is truly an experience.In a theater with 250 people, at the end of the movie there was complete silence. I mean it, you could have heard a pin drop. I have never been to a movie that when asked how I liked it, the words would not come. All I could say was Wow!I have heard so much hype about this movie being anti-Semitic. As a Christian, I question where this is coming from. This is not a movie, which can be construed in any way against any group of people, be it Jew, Roman etc. This movie showed that it was not any one group of people who killed Jesus. It was all people. It has been written that Jesus new that he would suffer and die for our sins only to rise from the dead. He knew that he was destined for this. What we as Christians know is that it could have been any group there calling for his death. And in a way, it was all people because he died for all of us. To say that any one group of people is responsible is ludicrous. We need to remember that this was foretold. It could have been anyone in that crowd. But ultimately, we are responsible and need to be true Christian and not blame - because if we do, we are no better than those who are saying that we will become anti-Semitic. I pray for them that they will find some sort of peace in knowing that us Christians are not as judgmental as they think we are. I'll be saying a prayer for them.

1654,dabri1027,What Gibson is trying to convey,8,27 February 2004,"I saw ""The Passion"" on opening night, and after about ten minutes of it had passed, it no longer felt like a movie; it was more like watching real life.  I am of Roman Catholic faith, but I viewed the film with an open mind that was ready for criticism if it was deserved.  However, after seeing it, I would like to say that anyone who calls this film Anti-Semitic is either bias, too sensitive, or went into the movie with an attitude that prevented them from seeing the real message.  First of all, the Romans come off MUCH worse than the Jews.  Second of all, asinine critics who say that the Jews ALL come off as terrible are either blind or lying.  There are several instances of Jewish compassion toward Jesus, such as a woman giving him a towel to wipe his face as he carries the cross, and throngs of Jewish women who are weeping for him.  As soon as you realize Gibson's film is genuine, it is easy to see why he made this movie.  This movie was made in order for people of every faith to see exactly how much Jesus went through for the human race.  Any Catholic knows Jesus was tried and crucified, but the severity of the torture he went through is something we don't hear in graphic detail.  It's that detail that Gibson is showing.  The gore is horrendous and is definitely too much for any child to watch, but it is an important thing for any adult to see.  Seeing how much Jesus went through is also seeing how much he cared for existence.  This was an absolutely brilliant and moving film, and it would be a shame for anyone to not see it because of a bad review.",The Passion of the Christ

During the movie, I was unsure as to the purpose of the plot, or even the composition of the characters, one in particular, but as the film drew to a close, it all became clear as to the purpose of the message the movie absolutely blows you away with.  I consider myself to have seen many movies, and to be a critic in some way of each of them, until this movie, there has never been a movie that I walked away from without one word to say, keep in mind this is not because of my opinion of the movie, it's that I just couldn't even begin to put any of the emotions this movie brings out into any amount of words.",The Passion of the Christ

Mel Gibson seemed almost sadistically obsessed with the pain and torture of Jesus, presuming Jesus' death must have been the most miserable in all recorded history.  Based on Gibson's portrayal, the viewer is lead to believe that Jesus is one of the few people to ever be crucified and it is the extreme nature of his murder that gives his sacrifice meaning. However if one looks to the history of the time, they will find that crucifixion and flogging were commonplace punishments under Roman rule with no more shock value attached to them than a modern day life sentence.  The Romans crucified robbers and heretics regularly and there would have been no major moral conflict on Pontius Pilate's part, as he ordered such punishments hundreds of times.  The Jewish crowd also would have had no real control over Pilate's decision, as the movie implied, as they were all strictly held by Rome's iron fist.Theologically speaking, what made Jesus' death unique was not the extreme nature of the violence he endured, but that he chose to endure it at all. The fact that the son of God would choose to die like a common criminal is the miracle and to imply this would be more or less miraculous based on the gruesomeness of the death is to miss the point entirely.
Mel Gibson has revived the ancient Roman entertainment of throwing Christians to the lions, but this time it is Jesus himself that is torn apart for the viewer's pleasure.   If you enjoy spattered blood and shrieks of pain, then this is the movie for you.if you are looking for spiritual inspiration, there are so many better places to find it.",The Passion of the Christ
1658,ken-fifer,"Difficult, but necessary to watch",10,25 February 2004,"I have honestly never been as deeply moved by a movie as this one moved me. I went through a myriad of emotions, (sorrow, anger, thankfulness, and joy), to name a few.  I'm glad to see a movie based on Biblical events that attempts to tell the truth about them without sugarcoating them.  Make no mistake, the Bible is not PG rated.  There are brutal realities as consequence to our sin, the most egregious of which is honestly told in this movie.  for this reason I wouldn't take children to see this movie due to the graphic depiction of the torture that Christ endured.  This is also not a movie to go to for entertainment.  Prepare to leave the theater either wanting to talk to someone about it, or not speak to anyone at all. Either way, this is an extremely well-made movie that deserves to be seen, and it's content merits processing and consideration.",The Passion of the Christ
1659,Lucifer_Morningstar,Work of Art,10,25 February 2004,"This film is a work of art.It was not meant to be ""gentle"" but to SHOW the sufferings of the Passion. If you were there at that time, THEN those kind of scenes will likely to be presented at your eyes.We dont need another ""washed"" version of The Passion of Christ. We NEED to understand what SACRIFICE is, and what is the COST of that sacrifice.Simple words and nice movies wont give you real understandig, as it isn't givin us real understanding all those WAR scenes we use to watch on TV. We need to EXPERIENCE what is to give everything for the ones you love, the violence in this film is just to carry out the LOVE every human being should give one another.The rest is just silence. And in silence we find God. And the audience came out in deep silence.Tnx Mel.",The Passion of the Christ
1660,ajamessloan,Well done,10,25 February 2004,"*spoilers likely to appear*I think that this is the only movie I've ever seen that has choked me up so repeatedly that I lost track of how often.If you are even superficially familiar with the Gospels, you will know a general idea of what is in the movie.  You can't, however, prepare yourself for how real it seems.That is the only description in my mind that does it justice.  The movie makes the Passion real.Jim Caviezil (sp?) did well as Jesus, but IMO Maia Morgenstern, as Mary, gave the best performance of all.  When I saw the expression of sorrow on her face as she rushed to succour Jesus along the Via Dolorosa, my eyes teared up completely.  They tear up even now as I am writing about it.Some commentators have condemned the movie for anti-Semitism.  I would like to note a few things with regards to that charge.  Most of these commentators hadn't seen the movie before saying what they did, so take their words with a skeptical mind.  The only way one can possibly leave this movie with an anti-Semitic thought is if that thought was there before the movie started.  Finally, about the charge that Jews are shown to be responsible for the death of Christ.  Well, they are because we ALL are.All in all, it was well worth my $4.50 matinee price.  I'd pay twice that amount for this movie.  Now if Hollywood would make more meaningful movies like this one...",The Passion of the Christ
1661,jogiba,It is as it was,10,25 February 2004,This is by far the best film on the Crucifixion of Christ. The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is beautifully done. I think the amount of bloodshed that is shown had to be there to have the impact of what was done to Christ. The score by John Debney is a perfect match to each scene. Jim Caviezel was perfect as Jesus and should be in the running for best actor next year. After seeing the reviews by pro movie critics I was expecting a two hour blood fest but seen an accurate account of what is in the Bible. I think some people forget what the subject matter is. If any movie can change your life this is it.,The Passion of the Christ
1662,anthonylterry,"Outstanding, and real spiritual adventure.",10,26 February 2004,"No person, Christian or not, could see this movie and not have a greater appreciation of the passion of the Christ.  His suffering was artfully shown and for me as a Christian, it was a very moving spiritual experience.  I will never pray again the same way I did before I saw this movie.  I certainly have a better understanding of His suffering and what he really went through to pay for my sins.  This is a must see for all religions if they want to better understand what the passion of Christ is all about. The only draw back to me was the language.  It did not increase my appreciation of the passion to hear it in the ancient languages.  English would have been just fine.  It was the act of His unselfish love that was of most interest, not the languages.  The acting was excellent, the special effects outstanding and the movie deserves ""Best Picture of the Year"" honors.",The Passion of the Christ
1663,movee_girl,excellent and touching,10,25 February 2004,"I saw this movie at a matinee today and i thought that it was excellent.Many are upset about the violence, but if you have read your Bible you would know how realistic this depiction is.  Remember that they did not shower Him with kindness.  This movie really made you think about what was sacrificed for us and it was also very humbling.  I was sitting there thinking all this for us and so many of us don't even try to live righteously.  I am going to be a better person starting now. I left the movie theatre feeling very inspired. I realized that my bad day on yesterday could have been much worse and that I have a lot to be thankful for. I think that this movie was well worth my time and money.",The Passion of the Christ
1664,FathersHouse,"The best film ever made, there can't be one more moving!",10,25 February 2004,"This was the best movie I think I've ever seen!!! I have never seen a movie that caused me to cry while the final credit were running while thinking back on scenes in the movie. I left the theater not wanting to talk with anyone but just to allow what I had just witnessed to sink in. This is not a movie to eat popcorn through, when you consider that all that brutality was not what Jesus deserved but he took it for us. I will definitely see this movie again but I will have to take a week just to allow it to sink in. I will buy this movie and it will be the only one I can watch more than twice without getting bored with it. This movie didn't have the usual uncomfortable scenes that don't seem to fit but because they are in scripture they have to put them in, no every scene was perfect in how it seems to fit in scripture. This film is a must for everyone!!!",The Passion of the Christ
1665,sfinx9898,Amazing...Gibson is fully blessed by God's touch...,10,25 February 2004,"I have just seen the movie and it presents itself with such grandeur and simplicity, where the director and the remarkable crew do an outstanding job. You feel like you're taking part to the action; walking, crying, suffering with the actors, understanding the true meaning of Christian love . being filled with emotion and passion for good---despise evil and search in your soul not for Anti-Semitism, but for that `love you neighbor as you love yourself', for peace and understanding.for the love of GOD. What this movie shows, despite some comments of the critics and `extreme groups' is a reality that for a few is too much to bear `as truth itself is' .meanwhile for the others depicts the significance and the light of God, that despite suffering and pain ,permit us to reach beyond our narrow human intellect by acceptance and understanding. What Gibson portrays here is the ultimate in artistic creation, where the opposites (darkness vs. light, good vs. bad, faith vs. despair) emerge and converge into an epic of such simplicity, but in the same time accurate artistic masterpiece. It is a blessing and an ultimate joy to be able to have such an opportunity. Fully recommended for every person that considers herself or himself a human being searching for wisdom and truth.Two very BIG thumbs up!!!!",The Passion of the Christ
1666,pirate_stream,try not to cry,5,25 February 2004,"this film scores pretty high on it's ability to evoke sadness, anger, rage, weariness, and compassion. the only flaws i could find to damper this emotional jetlag was the fact that almost every middle easterner was white. when i first saw the face of ""jesus"" i couldn't help but laugh that it was the same face of jesus i've been seeing...white long haired hot hippie. now, there's something to be said for religious art and the traditions that give us faces to the names or gods we have, but i wish at this point with all of the historical knowledge available that really, its just too much. i'm white and i just couldn't get into it because of the whiteness of it all.now, the second thing i found annoying was that most characters were always angry, always hateful, always helpful, always sad, or always perplexed and annoyed. there were very few actors who were given the chance to show face and then change that emotion...even jesus, who was never angry, always one dimensional, always quiet, and always the whitest of the bunch. my friend pointed out that some of the extras looked to be of possible correct descent, but, those were the extras crowded in with two hundred other actors in one scene. the film picked up a little on jesus' ascent up the mountain, where people seemed to be annoyed that he was being beaten so much.the third and final thing i didn't really get was that this guy was whipped flogged slapped punched torn had a limp eye part of his nose chewed off and practically no skin that was not bloody, and yet, he made it as far as he did. i really dont think that someone who was that badly beaten would have made it. you could say it was a miracle, but i say its an eyesore and a gross oversite. it was just ridiculous and the way they were beating him was almost comical...reminded me somewhat of evil villans.oh, and satan was there, he's a white gothic dude with a little baby boy who's face looks a hundred years old. satan pops in and out catching the eye of the camera passing through the crowds or standing at the side...he's a bald dude with the blackest hood on.now the good thing was that mary became very old looking by the end of the film. also, there was a few moments of silence and blackness that made me and im sure everyone else extremely uncomfortable. good directing, good move. i dont know if anyone will acknowledge the silence in these critiques but i found it wonderfully irritating, in just the right way.
great overall, emotionally, even stoics walked out quiet and the theatre clapped, but historical innacuracies made it somewhat comical...call it overacting...melodramatic...it was good, but the fact that his wrists werent nailed and his hands were shows me that there wasnt much of a christian historian on the set.i rated this a five because it was great emotionally, but i took off five because it was very unbelievable.",The Passion of the Christ
1667,oma52,"Powerful, compelling, heart wrenching",10,26 February 2004,"I knew when I went to see `The Passion of the Christ' that I would cry - I just didn't know how much.  I cried practically from the beginning to the end.  This movie is not for everyone.  The violence is just too much for some people but the violence and extreme brutality are what Christ experienced.   James Caviezel as Christ gave a powerful, compelling performance.  I felt his pain and suffering.  From reading the Bible, I knew Christ suffered for me - that he paid for my sins with his pain and death. But, to see it made it so real to me - I felt like I was there.  Maia Morgenstern, as his mother Mary, gave such a heart wrenching performance - you could feel her pain at losing her first born in such a horrible way. Rosalinda, as Satan, also gave a powerful performance - you could feel the evil emanating from him.  It is, without question, the most powerful, compelling, and historically correct movie of Christ's suffering and crux fixation I have ever seen.I do not feel the movie is anti-Semitic.  It is a fact that a Jew betrayed Jesus.  It is a fact that some Jewish religious leaders stirred the crowd up so they condemned Christ to death.  It is also a fact that the Romans nearly beat him to death and did crucify him.  You don't hate an entire race or ethnic group because of the actions of a few - that is bigotry.I saw this movie as Mel Gibson meant it - a depiction of the last hours of Christ.  Christ, at any time could have stopped what was happening.  No one, least of all Satan, had control over him - no man could have crucified Him had He not allowed it.  Christ asked God to forgive them because they didn't know what they were doing. Christ forgave those who beat and crucified Him as well as those who forced His crux fixation even as he died.  There is no greater love - Christ willingly gave his life for us.What every one should take from this film is that Christ willingly suffered and died for each and every one of us - for our sins - that we might have eternal life.  All we have to do is believe and accept Christ into our lives as our Savior.  It's a very simple thing to do.I don't believe Mel made this movie to make money or to create anti-Semitic. I believe he just wanted to produce a movie showing the last hours of Christ and that is what he did.  To Mel I say - thank you and God bless you.",The Passion of the Christ
1668,gabbydion,2 THUMBS UP !,10,25 February 2004,"This movie was excellent, a must-see. In my opinion 2 thumbs up, shows it (according to Pope John Paul) ""As it was"" without Hollywood glitz or connotations - graphic, but no pointing fingers at any race or religion; just a true to heart replica with excellent imagery, cinematography and overall direction. It has a hardcore message that is intensely conveyed. Mel Gibson took the very significant excerpt of Our Lord's most grueling sacrifice for our Salvation and the result was a beautifully rendered work of art. Those who are negatively judging this film should focus elsewhere and thus positively utilize it first and foremost to re-inforce their own faith rather than criticize one of the best portrayals of the passion which is meant only as a yet another tool &  reminder of why we all exist !",The Passion of the Christ
1669,ietmelive,"Beautiful, touching movie.",10,25 February 2004,"When I came in to view 'The Passion of the Christ', I wasn't expecting for it to have the impact on my soul that it did. Like most, I simply went out of curiousity pertaining to the accusations of anti-semitism. What I found was the most accurate of movies based on Jesus that I have seen.Throughout the picture, I found myself, and those around me, brought to tears by the depictions of Jesus being whipped and tortured. The most powerful scenes, however, were that of the crucifixtion.Between the facial expressions of the actors, the graphic angles of the actual nailing to the cross, and the flashbacks to the last supper; there was not a dry eye in the house. I had never seen this happen in a theatre.If you get a chance to see 'The Passion of the Christ', take it. You won't be disappointed with what you see. Just be sure you have a strong stomach. This movie is not for children, or the weak of heart.------9 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
1670,dautlus,My Bible Is Real,10,25 February 2004,"This movie is simply breathtaking. I have always heard the story of Jesus ever since I was a child and how he died for my sins. However, normally the best visually I could get were the 12 perfect pictures of Christ with his cross in the back of the church. This movie shatters and obliterates those images and replaces them with scenes of a real life man taking an extraordinary beating. Gore....present, but very necessary. Not the Kill Bill over the top, arms and limbs type of thing. Think more along the lines of a realistic depiction of lacerations and cuts to numerous to count. After watching the movie I am disappointed in the ""critics"" reviews thus far. Some go as far as saying that you will leave theater spiritually empty handed. This is if your talking about Oprah ""spiritually"", hug your neighbor type of feel good crap. You do not take any of that with you. However what you leave with is an understanding of the tremendous suffering one man went through to save you. I can, for about a second, understand that if you are a nonbeliever this might be a little much to chew on much less believe. But think for a second, that if Jesus wasn't who he said he was.............his crucifixion was an awful lot to go through for absolutely nothing.  This was the only movie I've ever been to were the crowd afterwards was speechless. None of the ear trembling buzz normally associated with a dispersing theater crowd. I'm sure everyone was as much in awe as I was. But the morale of this story is to see the movie for yourself. Read the relevant biblical chapters and compare notes. Take your time. Decide. All I know is that my bible is real.",The Passion of the Christ
1671,msthorne,A Disappointment,2,25 February 2004,"I had waited months for this film and was hoping that it would be something special. Luckily, I was able to see 'The Gospel of John' about 4 weeks ago - and that film is very special.The Mel Gibson film not only adds violence to an already violent story, but it also adds apocryphal dialogue and events not to be found in scripture. This film takes liberties without taking responsibility. Other films like 'The Last Temptation of Christ' and 'The Gospel of John' provide context and explanation at the outset - in other words, they advise the viewer either of some fantasy quotient or the situation in the early Church which helped to form the Gospel.Gibson's scholarship is sloppy. There are things that don't necessarily need to be there. Example: Jesus in 3inch link chains being dangled from a bridge by the temple guards (not the Romans) and coincidentally in a spot where Jesus and Judas make eye contact. Judas then changes into a demon of sorts. There are lots of 'Ghoulies' in the film that just aren't there in the scriptures. Question: Pilate addresses the crowd in fluent Aramaic but then takes Jesus inside where they converse in Latin??? Does Mel know that Jesus was not a Roman Catholic? There is also a lot of Roman Catholic piety that creeps in. These are traditional things not found in the Bible. The veil of Veronica scene is one of these. So too is the scene where Pilate's wife Claudia gives Mary some towels that Mary uses to wipe up what appears to be a couple litres of Jesus' blood after the scourging. This is not scriptural..This movie is like a 'Rocky does the Stations of the Cross'.
I am all for pushing the envelope in the direction of truth via the means of solid scholarship and archaeology. This movie wants to seal us into an envelope of sadomasochistic piety that has its origins in marginal reactionary Catholicism.There is precious little character development beyond that of Pontius Pilate. Two hours is spent on depicting graphic violence that embellishes a horrific event beyond what likely happened. Try to count how many lashes Jesus receives.... They go up to 32 and then take a break to change implements and then add 30+ more. Then they roll him over and do the front? I expected brutally accurate depictions but not such hyperbole. At the crucifixion, the Roman soldier who lances Christ's side is then showered with the blood and water. The scene is baptismal in intent, but it plays out like cheap Monty Python blood spurting.But please do go see for yourself.Mel doubtless believes, the ultimate judge of this film is God and I do so hope for this. The film will be a success in the theatres but I believe it to be a failure as inspirational drama and as Christology.",The Passion of the Christ

I came away with a better appreciation for my life and my own sins. It is not a typical Hollywood movie. Instead it is a real piece of art that is very inspiring, which is why I give it a solid 8.As a side note to the popular press' assumptions made without actually seeing the movie... It was not anti-anyone or anti-anything.  It is a first rate piece of art that portrays The Passion closely to the writing in the text of the Bible.

1675,warnog,one of the few movies i felt connected to...,9,26 February 2004,"I saw this movie on its opening day here in College Station. Speaking from a Christian perspective, I think the movie dives right in to breaking the Americanized Christianity paradigm. People that I've grown up with have no problem seeing Jesus portrayed on a TV movie as a white man with blue eyes, white cloak, and a blue sash. Some people don't realize the bible was not written in English and that Jesus was Jewish. Moreover, some people don't seem to understand what the circumstances were surrounding the death of Jesus. They skim the Bible; glean something about Jewish high priests plotting to kill him and Pilate allowing him to die after washing his hands. While that is the basic jest of the bible's teachings, there is so much more to it.I think this movie will do good to show Christians something about what was going on during that most critical time in our history.
The movie itself was made for maximum impact. The only problem I had with the entire movie were parts I found to be annoyingly drawn out. The first was the walk of Jesus thru the town carrying the cross. I realize that Jesus was struggling to stay conscious much less carry a cross, but how many times can they show him fall and get backup without it being distracting. The other was the scene where Jesus was being scourged. I've read reports that it lasted from 5 to 18 minutes. Due to content, repetition and other factors, it seemed it would never end. I felt disturbed after that scene.It was a moving movie, not for the squeamish.",The Passion of the Christ
1676,kreidler-4,Stunning!,10,26 February 2004,"This movie is one that I will see more than once.  It is so powerful!  It brings the gospel to life.I think that I love Jesus more than ever before after seeing this movie. I have been a Christian for several years, but this film had an impact that no other film has had on me.  If you love Jesus, expect to love him more.I think that everyone that leaves the movie will have a deeper sense of what God did for us.  He sent his only son, to die for the sins of everyone. Many people say ""Who killed Jesus?""  I would have to say the ultimate answer would be that Jesus allowed himself to be killed for us.  He offered himself up to be the sacrificial lamb for our sins.The movie is humbling.  You see that sin just isn't worth the pain that it causes.I hope that everyone thinks about why Jesus would die for us.  If Jesus were a fraud, why didn't he back out of it?  Why would the disciples (except for Judas) continue to follow Jesus after his death and resurection?  The disciples knew that they would have to die for following Jesus.  Who would die for something that wasn't true?God Bless Mel Gibson and the people who contributed to this film.",The Passion of the Christ
1677,derikamy,A powerful and passionate view at Christ's Life & Death,10,26 February 2004,"This movie's depiction of Christ's last 12 hours was remarkably accurate and visually devastating.  Gibson's vision will be greatly praised by viewers from around the world.  This movie was fantastic, and yet terribly difficult to sit through.  At times, I had to force myself to watch...and yet somehow knew that what I was seeing would forever change my life.  Critics will no doubt mock the vivid display of violence.  However, the truth behind Christ's horrible punishment needed to be revisited...and seen by the millions of movie-goers around the world.In short, this is a must see movie.  His passion will grip your soul as you sit in your seat.  The core of your being will cry out to your repressed spirit...and if you trust to believe in what your eyes are seeing, this movie can bring about a new hope in your life.It's message:  that we are guilty of sin, but God cannot punish us, because the punishment has already been paid...by Jesus.",The Passion of the Christ

Finally one is made that truly depicts the suffering of Christ.  Why is there more protest to this movie than any other religion?  He was a real person who lived, loved, suffered and died.  HE deserves respect and I feel this movie delivers it.  For those who protest, why shouldn't Christians exercise their freedom of speech too.  Christians today feel they cannot speak out about their beliefs.  Thank you to Mel Gibson who was brave enough to do so. Mr. Gibson has suffered much for this ""project"".

1679,cindaroo7,I'm not being sacrilegious,2,26 February 2004,"This movie was far too, and unnecessarily bloody. I have been told that this was in order to make us feel how much Jesus suffered, but if you spend more than half the movie looking away then you are not seeing or feeling anything except disgusted. I also felt that the message of faith and love was lost in the violent and graphic images. I left the theater not feeling moved or restored, but angry and tired. I also felt that the actors were guilty of extreme over acting causing the film to be cheesy and unrealistic. Despite my comments, you will probably go see this movie.

1680,ali_salerno,Violence in context,10,26 February 2004,"I saw Gibson's ""Passion"" last night, and it was a very moving, personal experience. For me, the movie ""humanized"" Christ's death, which people often trivialize, even those that believe in him, perhaps they believe that he was both man and God. It really saddens me that the movie is causing many Jewish people to feel victimized or threatened, because my personal response is more love towards a loving God, not any blame or hatred toward the people that were part of his death. Also, I just can't believe people wouldn't be ready to stomach the violence shown in the movie, when they know going in that it's about crucifixion in the first century, the same period of time the Romans allow gladiators to brutally kill one another for sport, and often killed prisoners by tying them to stakes and letting wild animals eat them alive. In summary, I think Mel had to make very hard decisions on what to bring to the movie, and what to leave out, and I think he made good decisions.",The Passion of the Christ
1681,madcowsb,Wow.,1,26 February 2004,"Just saw this movie last night.  I've got a TiVo so I never saw a commercial for this movie.  Didn't even hear of it till my friend asked me to go last weekend, so I didn't know what it was I was getting in to.
Unfortunately, about 20min into the movie, I realized that I had just paid $10 to watch a poor guy get tortured for two hours.Disturbing.  Very disturbing.Now, I usually don't mind some gore in movies.  Usually it's in addition to the story (although maybe a bad one, Jason/Freddie style).  Speaking as someone who's not religious, this movie was really *nothing* but gore.  I will say it did a pretty good job capturing the torment amoung Judas and the roman governor.  But if you remove the graphic beating, whipping, and nailing scenes, frankly I don't think there's more than a 20min movie in there.Shock value, pure and simple.  It's like one of those cheap thrills horror movies.  No plot, just tension and disturbing scenes to make the audience squirm.Anyway, that's just me.  In any case, I saw last night that some parents brought their kids to this movie!  DON'T DO THAT!  I thought *I* was going to have nightmares...",The Passion of the Christ
1682,raptor7645,thoughts,9,26 February 2004,"I became a christian when I was 7... always have gone to a protestant non-denom church, Vineyard for anyone who cares, having listened and read, and been taught about the Christ I was extremely excited to see this film. Saw it the first day it came out and probably going to see it 2 more times before the week is up.  I LOVE IT... I cried and felt just how truly much the Lord loved each and everyone of us.  The climax for me is where you could see how he loved all of us was when he fell, and his mother, mary, came to pick him up as any mother would attempt to do, to carry his burden and hold him in her arms again, but our Lord knew that this burden was his own to bear and no one could help him or even make the burden lighter ""See woman, I make all things new"" (I almost began to weep).  To see a man, who being also God, feeling the complete pain physically and emotionally and spiritually, and being ostrisized for love  he gets up, carrying the heavy cross upon his completely eviscerated body, wounded and damaged he treads on.  For You and I.  Mel Gibson did a marvelous job as showing what Jesus went through, how the Cat of Nine Tales, the whip used on him, would have destroy his body completely, then to have him carrying his cross to Golgotha and then to be nailed to it and thrown in the ground for our sins was the most painful experience anyone could have gone through and witnessed. A few things bugged me about the film, but nothing serious; they were either artistic choices by Gibson or the catholic belief about Jesus' Mother, either way the film is incredible accurate and if you can't walk away feeling like you've been ungrateful for your salvation (as I did and with a renewed fire of God's grace), or feeling that how could someone still LOVE those men who persecuted him then you trully have a hard heart.

I am not a practicing Catholic or Christian, though I have been both baptised and confirmed. It was my mother that had to practically drag me to see this movie and I am so happy she did. I don't think I would have ever seen it by my own free will. I was skeptical at first becuase of how gory I heard it was going to be and, I'm not going to lie, it is extremely gruesome, but that is how it really was back then. I don't mean to sound cheesy and say that I am now reformed and an all out religous guru, but I will say that I plan on attending church more often and giving up things I know are not looked on highly.

The visual detail was incredible and the incorporation of demons and the devil was impressively done. As for the anti-Semitism, I did not see or feel that in any way.  It was us, the human race that put Christ on the cross.   (If you do take the position that the Jews were responsible, then should you not also be anti-Italian?)  As for the scriptural accuracy, it was not perfect but as close as any Hollywood movie I'd ever seen.  The violence was not violence in the Hollywood sense.  Simply put, like Schindler's List, this is history retold.  If you hold to that position, then what an incredible retelling it was.  If you don't then I suppose everything told about what Jesus did was in vain.  But if it's all true.",The Passion of the Christ

GO SEE, ""THE PASSION""...I Love Him and the movie",10,26 February 2004,"For those that speak negatively about the movie I just can't believe that they have read the Bible. If they have read the Bible, I question the love they have for God. ""THE PASSION"" can't receive enough praise. As far as a movie is concerned besides the accurate scriptural content... HIGH PRAISE to the acting, directing, cinematography, wardrobe, set, writing........PRODUCTION! All of this movie is of EXCELLENT quality.Just want to say that I highly recommend the movie and that I encourage you to see it. If, you haven't already. Why? Please read...I don't know which verse the movie begins with. Just knows it starts with a scripture from Isaiah 53. All of it is worth reading. The foretelling of Christ is clear:
Isaiah 53 53:1 Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? 2 He grew up before him like a tender shoot,and like a root out of dry ground.He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. 3 He was despised and rejected by men,a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. 4 Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows,yet we considered him stricken by God,smitten by him, and afflicted. 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions,he was crushed for our iniquities;the punishment that brought us peace was upon him,and by his wounds we are healed. 6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray,each of us has turned to his own way;and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. 7 He was oppressed and afflicted,yet he did not open his mouth;he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,and as a sheep before her shearers is silent,so he did not open his mouth. 8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away.And who can speak of his descendants?For he was cut off from the land of the living;for the transgression of my people he was stricken.   9 He was assigned a grave with the wicked,and with the rich in his death,though he had done no violence,nor was any deceit in his mouth. 10 Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer,and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering,he will see his offspring and prolong his days,and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. 11 After the suffering of his soul,he will see the light [of life] and be satisfied;by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many,and he will bear their iniquities. 12 Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death,and was numbered with the transgressors.For he bore the sin of many,and made intercession for the transgressors.NIV
The movie is a blessing to see. This is our time machine to be with Christ in his last 12 hours. We can also take moments elsewhere with him.
From the dialogue of the movie much scripture is emphasized to good use. To understand why those who don't like the movie and why others do is simple. The movie uses the scripture well:John 15:9-25 9 ""As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. 10 If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love. 11 I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. 12 My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. 13 Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. 14 You are my friends if you do what I command. 15 I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit-fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. 17 This is my command: Love each other.18 ""If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. 19 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. 20 Remember the words I spoke to you: `No servant is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. 21 They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. 23 He who hates me hates my Father as well. 24 If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. 25 But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: `They hated me without reason.' NIV",The Passion of the Christ
1687,lightning_struck,Time machine.,10,27 February 2004,"If I had access to a time machine, and paid for 2 hours worth, I would go see something related to my faith, and maybe the pivotal moments giving rise to it, or maybe some miracles.  Yes, I would choose the story of Christ's death and resurrection.  I would sample as much of those 72 hours as I could using those 2 hours for which I paid.  I truly believe that seeing this movie has been my time machine.The images, sights, sounds, and subtle music, are all wonderful enlightenment for me.  Beyond the violence, I saw and experienced the emotions involved, from many perspectives.  And it was this emotional realization which translated the violence beyond horror... into a wonderous knowledge that , somehow, I saw an indescribable gift of unconditional love to me; to all people.I am grateful for the experience.",The Passion of the Christ
1688,natebenn,Moving,9,26 February 2004,"I am still speechless after seeing this film. So many films are produced purely for entertainment value, I think the severity of the subject matter has befuddled a lot of people. Film is too powerful of a medium to have it be purely utilized for entertainment purposes. This film has made me re-examine my commitment to Catholicism. On a religious note, I refuse to believe that Christianity is a big conspiracy conjured up by Whitey. As CS Lewis said, either that man was a lunatic, or he truly was God made flesh. And, remember that the only manner of recording history back then was by writing about it. We assume some things to be true in history, like accounts of the Revolutionary War, the expeditions of Magellan and so forth from written accounts. We acknowledge those accounts as ""authority"" since written documentation was the only manner of recording events. Either Jesus was a looney-tune, or he did have disciples that recorded the sermons and events of his life.",The Passion of the Christ
1689,soulgruv,Not for everyone (read THE book first),10,26 February 2004,"This film is not for small children or for that matter, for people who don't believe that Christ's death and resurection are historical events.  It is violent and very real.  This movie seems to be striking a nerve with everyone who sees it.  For Christian's it appears to be a motivator and a reminder.  For others it seems to be a target. Mel did well to stick to the accounts in the New Testament. Neither this movie nor the New Testament are anti-semitic.  Some of the Jewish people depicted in this movie are devout followers of Christ, others chose to kill Him.  Would those chanting anti-semitism choose to align themselves with an angry mob and or an unjust system of priests?As for those figures of authority who took place in these events and turned away from the truth, they will answer individually for their sins.  They did not speak for all Jews, all men, or all women.  They spoke for themselves and, they made a bad choice based on their own desire for power.  God gave each of us a free will and in this case, the governing powers chose to hate Jesus and to turn Him over to be executed. If you believe that Jesus Christ died for you.  See this movie.  If you are looking to pick a fight or to discredit someone or some religion, save yourself the price of a ticket.  An understanding of the Gosples would be a reasonable prerequisite.  No one person or group took Jesus' life, He gave it.",The Passion of the Christ
1690,tapmana1-1,"Not a movie, an experience!",10,26 February 2004,"I went to see this movie on opening day, by myself.  My husband wasn't sure he wanted to see it and my children are too young.  After only a few minutes in the theater, I was no longer watching a movie, but had been transported in time to the last hours of Jesus.  I have been Catholic all of my life, and for the first time I feel that the words, phrases, prayers, etc. that I had been taught to say at all the right times during mass actually meant something to me.  I feel that I was born again in my religion and renewed in faith.  I have always known that Jesus died on the cross and what he died for, however, I never truly understood what those words meant.  I openly cried during this film, as did everyone else in the theater that day...as it is a painful experience, but the sorrow I felt was in the lack of understanding that I have had all of these years.  That when I race into church 5 minutes late with children in tow and sit during mass thinking about everything but what is being said, I have truly not understood the basis of my religion until now.  About all of the controversy surrounding the Jewish community I say this, ""A historical fact cannot be changed and from the larger community as a whole I do not believe that the strides we have made as a people will be damaged.""  I believe that everyone should see this film.  If not for the religious experience that you will undoubtedly be witness to, then for the moral message that has stood the test of time and is still relevant today...man has the capacity for great evil against fellow man...our human nature allows us to be very cruel.  With that said I hope that as every person sees it they feel a little more love, patience, and understanding toward their fellow human beings.  My hats off to Mel Gibson for the commitment he has made to bring something like this to end in the face of such adversity and that other people will be touched the way I was.",The Passion of the Christ

If you don't know the story....see the movie, then read ""The Book"" or vice versa.  One shouldn't critique the movie, but rather...if you believe in Jesus, know that God foretold his death to him and that he (Jesus) died, so that ""all"" of our sins may be forgiven (no matter who we are, how we are raised, or where we live).  It is, as it is said in the movie, God is the way, the truth and the light.  Jesus suffered, so that we may live.  It's as simple as that and to deny the suffering of Jesus and truth, is to deny God (my opinion).  Kudos to Mel Gibson for a bold move in making this extremely powerful movie with so few words and much truth.",The Passion of the Christ
1692,dexterslab84,Possibly the Best Movie I have ever seen!!,10,26 February 2004,"There are no words to describe how I feel about this movie.  I went and saw it last night, the theatres were packed with hardly a seat available to my surprise.  I watched the movie in awe and was mesmerized throught the whole thing.  I cried often, not so much at the brutality, but at the human aspect that Mel Gibson portrayed in Jesus.  The movie is artistically amazing, I cannot stop thinking about it.  The movie has made such an impression and changed me in so many ways.  I have attended church my whole life, but feel like I have taken for granted the sacrifice of the cross.  This movie is graphic, but accurate.  I can't believe so many people are complaining about the violence.  Yes, it is violent, but it is the truth.  What about ""Schindler's List"" that was a very violent and brutal movie, but it was the truth and people did not complain about how bad it was.  As for anti-semitism, that accusation is ridiculous, my husband is Jewish and he said that this was the best movie he has ever seen, he did not feel that this movie pointed the finger at the Jewish people, but at all of us.  Our sins are what put Jesus on the cross, every one of us.  We are all to blame. What all this criticism comes down to is people get angry when someone speaks to their conscience.  They don't want to face the reality of their sinful nature, so they direct their anger at anyone or anything.  I am still amazed by the excellence of the actors, directors, and everything. Despite the brutality, I really want to see it again!  This film is pure genius! Go see it for sure!!",The Passion of the Christ
1693,harveyknox,Speechless,10,28 February 2004,"I think most people here have summed up the movie quite nicely all ready. It's powerful...and I mean -really- powerful, so much that you just can't sit in your seat and not be affected by what you see on the screen.  What you've read in the bible or heard about in scriptures or books can't prepare your eyes for what they're about to see.  It brings the sacrafice of Christ into a whole new light, one that hits home as hard as possible.  It's just unimaginable to think that anyone could treat a fellow human being the way Christ was treated, and the graphic violence certainly drives that point home.  I don't think it was excessive to the point where it takes away from the movie, but man...you're just not ready for it to be -this- bad.I think the best comment on this movie would be the reaction of the audience that was in the theater when I saw it...and that was just stunned silence. Once the movie had completed, there was just dead silence in the theater. No one said a word, and the great majority of people sat in their seats and almost couldn't move.  Eventually they would file out, but still not one person among them said a word.  You could literally hear a pin drop in the theater.  I have never seen anything like that in all my time of going to the movies.I give this film a 10 out of 10 personally, because I've never seen any film that literally took you into the events that were happening and made you feel like you were there.  I didn't see this movie as showing Jews as being hateful either, because that almost seemed insignificant compared to the brutality of the Romans towards Christ.  I would tell anyone who might read these reviews that you owe it to yourself to see this movie at least once. There's just no way you won't come away from it a different person from how you went into it.",The Passion of the Christ
1694,jafienko,Accurate to the gospels,10,26 February 2004,"This film depicts historically what a crucifixion would of been like back in the day. For the open minded viewer, Mel Gibson's attempt the draw pathos of the central character Jesus is successful. This is a key distinction to the violence that is often seem in other films. I cannot think of any other film to mind where the main character suffers non stop for 90 minutes. Mel uses every trick in the book to depict the violence Jesus went through. For instance, there's a scene when the cross is being raised into it falls into position bringing the body to screeching halt only by the nails holding the body. This film is not anti-semitic in the sense that it does not purposely arouse anger against the jewish people. However, certain jewish people are portrayed to be the ones responsible for Jesus' death. An important point to remember that is not evident in the film is regarding Jesus trial which was held very early in the morning. Had it been held later in the day there would been more sympathetic jews around that might of stood up for him. Nevertheless, Mel has attempted to do visually what Bach tried to do musically with the passion of Matthew and John which was to get people to reflect what Jesus went through for our sins.",The Passion of the Christ

Is it violent? Yes, but the violence supports the story and illustrated the extent of the suffering, it's brutal but it's also realistic. Scourging and crucifying are brutal acts and the film depicts them realistically. Mary, the mother of Christ, watched his suffering, if she could handle seeing it, we should be able to as well.But, you will only get the full measure of this movie if you know, and believe in, the story. It is not a movie intended to entertain, please, or impress the critics.

You know whenever your scared because of a movie... or sad...someone says, ""its just a movie."" Well, after seeing this movie, i will never say that again.  Everything about this movie, whether you are a christian or not, was unbelievably brilliant.  I have never cried so much during a movie. It wasnt exactly ""entertainment,"" but i walked out a better and more loving person because of what Christ went though.  If you have no faith, you will after this movie.  If you have faith, you'll love more after this movie. By far, the greatest movie I have ever seen.",The Passion of the Christ
1697,Miss_Bianca2006,The Best Movie of 2004(also the Best Jesus and realistic movie dealing with him) of ALL TIMES,10,23 December 2004,"This is probably one of the greatest movies dealing with the last hours of Jesus Christ. I admit The Greatest Story Ever Told, with Max Von Sydow, Charlton Heston, Sidney Poiter and some of the greatest actors was a great movie but, it was as close to what Jesus went through in the last hours of his life. All, this about it being to bloody to violent, well DUUUHHHHHHH that's how it happened , what you expect Jesus to have a couple of whips on his back and be sunt on his way it says in the bible (Here is the verse in which it was said that he will be beaten and scourge) Matthew 27:26 "".......And when he had scourged (See that scourged) Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified"". Back in the bible days when the people were accused of a crime they were stripped and tied to a whipping post (OH didn't that happened to Jesus he was TIED) Then they will be beaten merciless with a whip consisting of leather thongs and each of those leather thongs had a jagged piece of metals on it (The Same whip that Jesus was beaten with) and fragments of their flesh would be torn off of the victim. There is another scripture in the bible Isaiah (The man who PROPHESIED it) it is Isaiah (Read your BIBLES if you don't believe me) 5:6 ""But HE was WOUNDED for OUR transgressions, HE was BRUISED for OUR iniquities; The chastisement four our peace was upon him, and by his stripe's we are healed."" They are also other scriptures in Isaiah where Jesus fulfilled them. He will be disfigured by suffering the scripture is Isaiah 52:14,53:2, he will VOLUNTARILY accept our guilt and punishment which is Isaiah 53:7 the first one will be fulfilled in Mark 15:17,19, the second in John 10:11 , and he will die with transgressors, which can be found in Mark 15:27,28 and Luke 22:37. So whether you people like it or not Mel Gibson showed the REAL thing, he showed how Jesus was nearly beaten to death just to save US, and as of right now I'm trying to figure out why would he die for people like you and me when we question on how the way he was beaten. We aren't nothing but a bunch of Hypocrites who believed that Christ had only a couple of slashes on his back, HE WAS SCOURGED, and he took it, he could've called on his angels but he didn't because he loved us o much, to do. Mel Gibson should get some Oscar, Golden Globe or any nomination, but he didn't because Hollywood wasn't ready for this kind of thing, Mel Gibson I give him his props for showing what Jesus went through and how he went through because THAT HOW IT HAPPENED you can believe that this movie is to gory, to bloody, too violent, or to anything but it really happened like that and Hollywood couldn't handle the truth and still cant bear the fact that Jesus was beaten like that for me and you. We need to wake up and face the fact that Jesus went through all that for us and this is how we act towards him questioning how it happened what we need to do is get down on our knees and pray because without it Mel Gibson movie wouldn't even be made. So this movie deserves every nominations from the Oscars, Golden Globes, because it was that good. I give this movie 10/10 actually it doesn't need a rating because it's the truth DEAL WITH IT.",The Passion of the Christ
1698,charmirtle,Beautifully grotesque,10,26 February 2004,"I saw this film on opening night and I have to say that this is the most powerful film I have ever had the privilege in viewing. Never have I seen such a display of violence and pure hate then in this film. For what Mel Gibson has done with the story of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life is truly something that will never be repeated in the history of film. Gibson uses the brutal truth no matter how brutal it is to give the audience the truth and if the truth scares you then don't see this film. In the papers and on the news lately there seems to be a story about this movie everywhere. There are many who have taken their young children to view this movie and to this I would have to advise against. The way the story is told it would be hard if not impossible for a child of 7 to 10 years old to understand that this man was being beaten for a purpose and not jsut see a violent display of shock and awe. For me being of sound mind and of mature age as well as having some knowledge on the subject of Christ and His suffering I saw this film as and emotional battle that left my insides in a knot. This is definately the most violent film I have ever seen. I didn't leave this movie without some doubts though. One thing that was troubling to me was that Gibson claimed that this movie is to be used as a way of bringing people to develop a belief in God and in His son Jesus. However I don't think that a person without at least the basic background of the story of Christ would come away with the message that this man was truely something special. Instead rather that the Jews, in particular the Jewish leaders, were a pack of blood hungry dogs with no same. That is if the audience member does not pay a watchful eye. So I head a warning to any of you who view this film that it is to be taken in its entirety and in its Biblical context, not necessarily historical. And that before making judgements on this film and the man Jesus make sure you know the full story.",The Passion of the Christ

It is an intense two hours, filled with emotion, tension, love and violence. Leaving the movie, you are not distraught because of the intense violence, but because the movie is so emotionally charged.  It is hard rating this movie on a normal film scale.  On a spiritual experience scale, it's a 10.  Its merits as a film are very strong as well though.  The cinematography is absolutely breath taking.  Every shot looks a like a photograph.  The acting is impeccable.  Gibson's direction truly makes you feel Christ suffer.  Go see it... learn from the main source how to be a true friend.",The Passion of the Christ

He was beaten, laughed at, denied, nailed to a cross for who, all of us.Mel Gibson did a terrific job in the final hours of Christ.  To be a believer and know the gospel really helps in understanding the movie. Without the knowledge of the four chapters of the bible you may not understand that Jesus knew he die and why he died.  That part really wasn't addressed.The violent nature of the film was not more bloody than other films, just that is of someone (as a Christian) that you love and believe in. Christians, I believe, will walk away thinking what pain he suffered for me, I don't deserve that kind of love.

1702,lionsmack,Gibson's portrayal not deserving of fiery criticism,10,26 February 2004,"Hopefully, now that this movie has been released nationwide, each individual from those with a fervent faith to those with a mildly piqued curiosity can draw their own conclusions instead of rely on outlandish reviews from biased ""experts"".The film has been quite polarizing, I've noticed.  It has been touted by supporters as an accurate depiction of the end of Christ's life here on earth, and it has been attacked by detractors as ""too violent"", ""bigoted, anti-Jew"", and ""manipulative"".  Personally, as a Christian, my fear was that the message was going to be warped, and that it might give non-believers a poor account of what happened.Oregon is widely considered a pretty liberal state.  However, as the credits began rolling up the screen, I was surprised to hear weeping throughout the theater.  Men and women, believer and non-believer.  Historically, the act of crucifixion has been recognized as the most painful, brutal, and drawn-out form of execution ever known.  To see it portrayed on the bigscreen was disconcerting, to say the least.  But sometimes the truth is hard to take.To the critics and detractors that say this movie is bigoted against Jews, I remind you that Christ was a Jew, and that his closest followers were Jewish also.  If you know anything about Christianity, whether you believe in it or not, you'd know that Christ's suffering was necessary, and that it was for Jews and non-Jews alike.  Any Christian who now turns their negative feelings toward Jews because of what they have witnessed, and anyone that believes the film is anti-semetic, has missed the message entirely.  If anything, this film should remind Christians of the most important facet of their faith... a part of our theology that in my opinion should be heralded above all others and was eluded to in many of the flashback sequences... the idea that we should love everyone -- friends and enemies.And as for the violence?  Three words... Saving Private Ryan.  When I watched that movie, I understood that it's graphic images were not there to rake in dollars, I believed that they were there to inspire us to meditate on what our freedom cost in terms of blood spilled and anguish experienced. I owe those soldiers and their families my freedom.  Gibson's graphic images are meant to inspire us to meditate on what OUR VERY LIVES AND SOULS cost in terms of blood and anguish.  I owe Christ my life.Obviously, I thought it was a fantastic movie, and it has strengthened my faith.  I urge every Christian to go see this movie for yourself.  I also challenge any non-believer, be you skeptic or curious, to see this movie and ask yourself one question when you walk away... ""What if it's true?""",The Passion of the Christ

At least the blood shed in this movie was for an actual reason.",9,26 February 2004,"First of all, I would like to say that I am very proud of Mel Gibson for making this movie. I am sooo glad that he had the courage to make a movie that really portrayed all that Jesus went through so that we can have eternal life. I am sick and tired of all of the cynicism by agnostics and atheists, and the way that the media has over-hyped this movie. Every day we watch movies with gratuitous violence and for once, the accurate, realistic portrayal of something that actually transpired, and everyone is having a cow! This is not about the violence, this is about the fact that the american public does not want to be reminded that God exists because then they would have to be held responsible to all that comes with that fact. I believe that the movie needed to be graphic. The imagery of the movie was beautiful; every scene deliberate and poetic. I am glad that the dialogue was in Aramaic and not English, which I believe would have cheapened it. James Caviezel was awesome! We should be just as free to make a movie about Jesus as anything else.Yes, the Jews were portrayed in a negative light, but guess what... they DID cause the crucifixion of christ, for greed, political power, etc. there is no other way to depict their role in all of this. You ask for accuracy and yet are not brave enough to handle or accept that which you ask for.The Passion of the Christ was a movie that we as a country need to see. Because in the end it really does not matter if you all believe that this transpired or not because the beautiful thing about the truth is that it exists whether we believe in it or not.",The Passion of the Christ
1704,onemoviereviewer,I'm an atheist and I think this is a very good movie,8,27 February 2004,"I'm an atheist and I think this is a very good movie. I gave it 8 out of 10.
After watching this movie with a skeptical eye, I have decided it is not logical to consider this movie anti-semitic.This movie is not for children however, I think it is tame enough to show on TV with a viewer warning. The violence is appropriate to the story.Mostly, the acting was very, very good however, the movie is not perfect. Gibson did make a few minor technical mistakes with special effects that had nothing to do with the accuracy of the story.Great performances were given by James Caveizel, Hristo Naumov Shopov, and Claudia Gerini. The anonymous woman character who stood with Mary as Jesus was tortured also did a great job. The others were good.
I think ticket sales will increase as word spreads about how good this movie is. This is the best film yet this year and deserves to be nominated for Academy Awards. I liked it so much, I'm going to watch it again.",The Passion of the Christ
1705,shakalaka,"too much violence, not enough of everything else",5,27 February 2004,"The violence is as advertised, and I agree with those who say it is too much.  I am not a queasy person, but watching a man getting tortured and abused for two hours is overkill and not all that inspiring.  What really ruined it for me was Satan walking in the background while the torturing goes on; it added nothing to the story except make me feel like I was watching Braveheart in Aramic - by the last scene I was wondering if Jesus was going to drop a white cloth on the ground.  The whole movie felt like the last fifteen minutes of Braveheart stretched out forever with as much beating as possible in between.  I think all the non-violent scenes made it into the trailer.  Unless you really cannot imagine how painful a whip or crucification can be, you won't miss anything if you pass this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
1706,Mr_Rogers19,AWESOME!!!,10,27 February 2004,This movie is going to change the world...you heard it here first. Jim Caviezel does an amazing job acting as Jesus. It has such an emotional feel to the entire movie and the powerful and gripping torture scene is just what people needed to see to truly understand what he went through. The scenes with Satan were also very clever and unique. I like how he was sort of in the shadows everywhere that Jesus went. Even at the end when he was crawling through the streets...Satan was right there in the shadows. But i think overall the final scene where Jesus is having flashbacks of the last supper was truly the most emotional scene and really can make you tear. Finally i think Mel Gibson did an excellent job portraying Jesus and the cruxifiction..the whole last scene will change the world completely. Good Job Mel!,The Passion of the Christ
1707,littlebunnylotta,Don't Overlook...,10,27 February 2004,"I've heard the story a thousand times, and somewhere in the middle, it became real and personal.  The passion of Christ paints a harsh picture - reality.  Facing the truth.  Some things you don't want to overlook... 1. He chose death -to bring glory to His Father, and to save us.  2. It wasn't any one man, race or religion that killed Jesus, it was the sin of all humanity. 3. Satan is always standing around a corner, waiting for an opportunity, wanting us to fall.  The temptation to take the easy way out is always there...good think Christ didn't take the easy way out.  After seeing this movie, i realize that it just takes a lifetime to understand what He's done and what He went through.  No matter how many times i think i get it...it's not going to be fully -until i see His face, touch His hands, look into His eyes. Oh...and this story doesn't end with His death, it begins with His new life.",The Passion of the Christ
1708,rnolle007,It could only be more intense if you were actually there.,9,27 February 2004,"Great work in bringing the greatest tragedy in the history of mankind to life on the big screen.  I felt like I was transported back in time 2,000 years to Jerusalem and was an eyewitness to the passion.  Apparently many others in the theater felt similarly, based on the weeping and stunned silence.   Acting was excellent, the scenery captivating and the music perfectly chosen.I have certainly seen movies more violent and brutal than this, but the embodiment of evil in the savage treatment of Jesus was more intense than anything I've ever seen.  From the movie, I could conclude that the devil was behind the crucifixion of Christ--not the Romans or the Jews.  The use of apparitions of demons at key points makes it clear that Satan is behind the action at hand.The movie by itself is an incomplete story.  It presumes that the viewer understands the premise--why Jesus is on trial and what is at stake spiritually.  Gibson did a good job helping us understand Pilate but the scene with Herod was befuddling.  The subtitles kept me focused on the screen while the spoken Latin and Aramaic added a certain mystique.",The Passion of the Christ
1709,cchapman-4,An Aesthetic Applause,10,29 February 2004,"Nothing could prepare one for the true experience of this movie.  No matter what is said about The Passion of the Christ, you simply have to see it to appreciate the depth of emotions portrayed by the actors and director. Never have I see such an exemplary display of interpretations to move an entire audience to silent contemplation.  It doesn't matter from what spiritual walk you come into this movie with, the suffering (passion) is made clear, deep and intense.  This is not a movie that should be underestimated through the application of a single religion or people.  It is a graphic depiction of the greatest love, sacrifice and passion ever written; visually amplifying the intense emotion of not just one character, but all aspects of the story.  BRAVO!",The Passion of the Christ
1710,hoover3940,Intense,10,27 February 2004,"This has to be the most intense movie I've seen. I was deeply moved by a movie I did not intend to ""give into."" For Christians, it is a true tribute to Christ. To non Christians, it is a great movie of a mother's love for her son, and a son's dedication to his beliefs. It is haunting, moving, and pushes the envelope. I give Mel Gibson much credit for taking a risk in telling this story. However, it is not for the weak, this movie takes strength to sit through. The violence is at times, very hard to handle. The images are graphic, to say the least. The acting is very good, so good you forget to watch the subtitles.

But, at the end of the movie, even though I knew what was supposed to happen and what was gonna happen, there was this sense of awe almost that came over me. I don't know if it was the movie itself or the fact that I was surrounded by people with pacemakers but everyones reaction to the movie was complete and utter silence for the most part. Lots of people were crying, and there was one woman who was on her knees praying.About the movie itself, I can't say I enjoyed it, but it was definitely good, worth my $12,50 I'd say. Even if you didn't like the content much, it was really well done, although, I don't know why you wouldn't like the content, there wasn't really anything that didn't happen to at least some degree according to the bible that I saw...How bad was the gore, well, I've seen worse of course, but the fact that you think ""This happened to someone I've learned about in church/school who was said to exist"" makes you think beyond just him getting hit and it having been done really well.Anyway, just thought I'd share this with you, it's most certainly a movie I wouldn't watch twice ;) (Not because it was bad. You'd just need to see it to understand I suppose).",The Passion of the Christ

However, since it's a well known Christian/Catholic historic event, people with Christian/Catholic background may get more meaning and challenge from it than the rest of the world while the latter group may find the movie more subtle and shocking. Some critics may focus on attacking the movie's brutal visual effects while missing the movie's main points in true meaning of power, humility, love, grace and salvation. Anti-semitic people do not believe Christ is willing to give his life for all people even after watching this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
1713,turboz77,Worth Your Hard Earned Money ?,10,27 February 2004,As a movie goer I like the tinsel and lights and just about anything else you can throw in there to stimulate ones heart rate and emotions that push its audience to the edge of their seats.  Here you have a movie with none of the hype and Hollywood glamour you will find in your gigantic block busting locomotive screaming movies you often see year after year. However with that aside I stood amazed after watching this movie.  Mel Gibson's finest work is right here and that's the truth no fuss about it.  It doesn't get no better and enuf said right there.  However if you are looking for a motion picture to go see that that can deliver then look no further.I tell you to look no further with confidence for this movie is it. This is a movie for everyone to see except small young children because of their ability to know what's going on because of the subtitles. I don't care what creed you are from this is the best motion picture I have ever seen in my entire life. What's so shocking is Gibson pulls it off without any Hollywood boom or bamo or glamour. I mean everything is timed to the moment and right on the money. I left that auditorium and I didn't feel like talking much. This movie leaves you numb.  I just was reflecting on what I had seen and even now as I sit on my little old computer and right this comment I feel that I have left with way more then what I had anticipated.  If you are looking to see the reviews on this page to find out if its worth your hard earned money that answer is simple. Yes.  And Yes again. Mr. Gibson if you see these reviews I would just like to thank you for making a motion picture against the grain.  I salute you on a job well done. When this movie comes out on DVD I will be there waiting for my copy sir.  Thanks so much for bringing to the big screen the gospel the way it was supposed to be viewed. Thank you for your courage and your integrity. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.,The Passion of the Christ
1714,meg_frog,emotionally charged with passion,9,28 February 2004,"(POTENTIAL SPOILERS)Fed up with all of the controversy, one way or another, I had decided to see this movie to judge (or simply view) for myself.  Although not everything was what I expected, much of it was much more than I expected.  Biblical allusions (both Old and New Testament) added to the richness of the film's beauty.Yes, I found it violent.  But, yes, I found it necessary and not over-the-top.  It is what happened and it was done for a reason, not a simply slaughter for mindless notions or whims.Yes, I found parts that weren't completely historically (crucifixion would have had nails through the wrists, not hands) and Biblically (the Devil's character and Mary Magdalene being the adulteress).  But, yes, I found much to be so close to the Scriptures that I had internalized that it was hard not to feel it was all so real.Overall, the film was marvelous, a piece of film cinematography history, as well as moving, even if a person doesn't believe that Jesus was the Messiah (which I happen to believe).  I, personally, was caught and found it so intense that I was unable to cry for most of the film, and sat in my seat simply shaking until the actual nailing of Jesus to the cross.  Planning on seeing this one again - less reading of subtitles and more into the heart of the actors (by the way, great job with Caviezel's eyes).",The Passion of the Christ
1715,kbumstead01,Perfect,10,27 February 2004,"The film combines the ultimate in cinematic art with the most powerful story ever told.  Gibson's career as a filmmaker has culminated in an achievement for all time.  This, the most significant film ever made, is a nearly-flawless masterpiece and an inspired work all around.  Jim Caveziel's performance is transcendent and completely engaging, and the ensemble performance by a cast of actors largely unknown in the U.S. is not to be surpassed.  Criticisms that the film is too violent are irrelevant; the scriptural accounts of the passion detail violence and brutality that, if put on screen, must by definition be too atrocious to watch. Nevertheless, the story as it is has been brought to life in a faithful, accurate, and fully-developed portrayal of the greatest sacrifice ever known.This is destined to be the film that the Oscars forgot but that the world will remember for as long as films are made.",The Passion of the Christ

While the violence is intended to shock, the emotion it touches is unexpected.  Christian or not, the character portrayals are unlike any I have ever seen, and for a Christian watching it, it will stir a whirl of emotions, different for each individual, but with the same outcome.  He did that just for me.  The original language being used, although I have not talked to my pastor who understands and speaks it, was highly effective.  Added such depth to the roles.  I did not leave thinking, those filthy Jews, I instead felt ashamed. Ashamed that He would have done that just for me.  My sin put him there. The special effects, wow, did that look real. Horror is what we all felt. The music drove the whole show through, until the very end.

In going to this show, I was not really sure what was going to happen. I heard such diverse script from critics, that I was not sure if it was good or bad, right or wrong, righteous or racist.  Critics like Screenit.com and NY Times have totally missed the point of the movie, giving it low ratings.  The point is history...history of the most influential person ever to have lived.  Some critics cannot handle that, and like to compare it to ""Private Ryan"", or other movies that are already nearly forgotten.Well, my advice is that you see this movie, knowing it is violent.  But what an amazing piece of history!  The world has gone to see this movie in record numbers...in spite of criticism.

I believe that is why the baby was in satan's arms, as we are all born into sin due to the fall of man.  Mel Gibson added some short spiritual sides into the movie that weren't specifically from the portions of the Bible, which he used to make you think about why he did it & the meaning.  Such as the crow, which I believe depicted the thief who choose to be blinded from the truth; the maggot which reminds me in hell ""the worm dieth not"", etc.John 6:29  Jesus answered and said unto them, ""This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom He hath sent.""John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, ""I Am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.""Romans 10:17 ""So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.""I am so pleased that someone finally made a movie without covering our protected American eyes to what Jesus really went through for us.  He went through all that so we might have Eternal Life.  One man dying for the sins of the whole world, to them who believe He is who He said He is.James Caviezel was an excellent choice to portray Jesus.

I believe that is was gory, but if you can go see a horror movie about a man chopping up teenagers with razor blade fingers, you could see how our Lord suffered for us!!!! I give Mel Gibson 10 thumbs up for what he has done. I do not feel this movie was pointing the finger at anyone as far as who had him crucified. Christ died for us all on his own, and if anyone payed attention to the beginning of this movie they would have seen that, and if you think hard about it he died for our sins, so us here in 2004 crucified him!!!!!!!!!!!

I think that if you don't like that this movie was made, don't go see it, but if you are a believer, it will no doubt make you want to be a better person and you will want to have a better relationship with God. I think that everyone should give it a chance and go see it. It was a very very sad movie, and I wish that I could take back all of the bad things that I have done in my life.

1723,georgeba-1,Fantastic movie!!!,10,28 February 2004,"This is the most amazing movie I have ever seen, and I highly recommend it. It is more of an experience, not just something you watch. One has the sense that Mel Gibson's entire being was immersed in making this movie. It is extremely powerful. It has definitely changed my life, in that for the first time I can say that I have some idea of what truly happened at the crucifixion. As a Christian, it has deepened my faith and commitment to Jesus. It faithfully tells the story of what happened, as it did happen. It is emphasized in the film that Jesus' purpose was to die for our sins and that he gave up his life voluntarily and that nobody could take his life from him. Rome represented most of the known world at that time and so, in reality Jesus was crucified by the whole world. If it were not for the sins of the world he would not have had to die. It is each of us individually, because of our sins, that are responsible for his death. There is no attempt at anti-semitism in the film. Any Christian who discriminates against anyone is not a Christian and is unfaithful to Jesus. The most compelling message of this film is ""Love"". Jesus came to us out of ""Love"", he suffered and died for us out of ""Love"", he prayed for those who crucified him out of ""Love"" and he wishes for all to be saved out of ""Love"".I would not recommend children under the age of 15 watch this movie because of the graphic scenes.

1724,Jesuitson,I walked away from the experience with something,10,6 March 2004,"I just saw the Passion of the Christ a few hours ago. What I feel is wonderful. I keep reflecting on what was shared over and over. I remember a scene in the movie that sticks out the most to me, ""Love those who persecute you."" I've read countless reviews by readers who hated the movie or thought it was too gory. I was angry that some people could be so ignorant and closed-minded. But now I realise how trivial it really is; anger. I don't want to be angry at someone for disagreeing with me. I want to love them anyway. Really I do. Love your enemies... Can anyone with an open heart not see that this was the theme of the movie? Jesus said that for that purpose he was born. He came to willingly go through what the movie showed so well. He came to die to seal off the punishment we deserve for out sins; to prevent the world from suffering endlessly in judgement. He came to show us the ultimate manifestation of love in it's purest form. ""There is no love greater that that of one who will lay down his life for his friends."" I will try to love more.",The Passion of the Christ
1725,jreisch,Most life-changing movie of its time.,10,28 February 2004,"The Passion of the Christ is a well-thought out, very accurate portrayal of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ.  While it is rated R due to the violent nature of the crucifixion, the movie does not even come close to the actual suffering recorded in scripture.  I recommend it highly.  It gives the viewer a much clearer picture of what a true Roman crucifixion consisted of and provides much food for thought as to the sufferings of Jesus for mankind.  Mel Gibson has carefully researched the historical and scriptural facts to produce an excellent picture.  Clearly, this is the best portrayal of the crucifixion that I have ever seen.  Jim Caveziel excels in the role of Jesus.  And the rest of the cast, while most are unknown to American movie-goers, do a wonderful job of drawing the viewer in.

I need to show him the same love. You don't really understand how mean they were to Jesus by reading it or someone telling you. You need to see it. It broke my heart and at the same time made me very honored to have the chance to go to heaven. I hope I can live my life right so I can go to heaven when I die.

1727,nikolai9-1,Beyond the Hype,10,28 February 2004,"The hype surrounding The Passion of the Christ has been extraordinary. I have seen very few films that have elicited as powerful reactions as this movie. The critics have waged a campaign accusing the movie to be virulently anti-Semitic. That charge had also been recently supplemented with the accusation that the violence and gore in the movie is obscene.
Many of the defenders of this film have praised this movie as a gift from God to mankind. Many people have stated that this movie was one of the greatest emotional events of their lives. Reports of audiences streaming out of the theaters across America in tears were common.As such, when I attended the movie last night I had various unanswered questions. Would this movie move me to tears? Would this movie somehow bring me closer to God? Would gross anti-Semitism envelope the theater? Would I be able to bear watch the violence and gore without averting my eyes?
After seeing this movie, I found almost all of the hype to be false or at least grossly overstated. The movie is simply about the last 12 hours of Christ's life - nothing more and nothing less.The charges of anti-Semitism are absurd. All the heroes in this move (expect for Pilate's wife) were Jews. The man who helped carry the cross of Jesus was sneeringly referred to as a `Jew' by a Roman guard. This scene was an obvious inclusion by Gibson to try to defer the accusations that the Jews were all the villains.The primary villains were Caiphas and the Roman guards. Caiphas was shown to engineer the execution. The Roman guards were shown as sadistic brutes.
So the movie can only be properly accused of being ant-Semitic if you should happen to believe that a Jew should never be allowed to play the role of a villain.If anything, I believe that true anti-Semites would not like this movie.
The recent charges of gross violence and gore are also exaggerated. While The Passion of the Christ may have been over the top concerning violence 30 years ago, that is certainly not the case now. For example, I found the movies Saving Private Ryan, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and We Were Soldiers to contain much more blood and gore. Never once did I feel the need to avert my eyes from The Passion.The `gore' of the movie primarily consists only of the blood from the scourging. While the scourging is ugly and intense, there are no decapitations, arms being severed or brains spattering on the wall as you will typically see in a modern action movie.Now for the positive claims - was this movie a life changing event? In was my experience that it was not. In the full theater I attended I did not seeing any of the expected weeping and wailing. After the movie was over, people pretty much just got up and left as with any other movie.
The movie did not introduce radical new insights to me concerning The Passion. I always knew that the real Passion and crucifixion were not as clean and as pretty as one might learn in Sunday school. The movie did not offer any new revelations concerning my own preconceived notion of The Passion.So is this a good movie? Yes, it is a masterpiece for what it is. Mel Gibson used his Braveheart style of direction to show the tale of The Passion in a haunting and beautiful manner. The acting was excellent and the musical score was able to set the proper tone.In many ways comparing The Passion to other movies gets into the apples and oranges category. The Passion of Christ does not really have an interesting or in-depth plot. There are no plot twists with multiple plot threads. As such, it can not be compared to a movie such as Dr Zhivago. The Passion deals with a very narrow but important event.This film also demands that the audience has an understanding of basic Christian theology. Someone that was never exposed to Christianity would not be able to understand this film in the proper context. To such people the film would probably seem as an exhibit of a pointless and brutal execution. As such, I do not believe that The Passion is meant as a good vehicle to gain converts to the Christian faith. The Passion is a movie that is meant to `preach to the choir'.So if you are in the `choir', you will find this film to be a masterpiece. I imagine that millions of Christians will add this to their DVD collection. If you are not a Christian, I would not recommend this film - it is not really meant for you.Remove all the hype and you will find a small gem of a film. I have no doubt that The Passion of the Christ is an instant classic that will be viewed and appreciated by Christians all over the world for many years to come.",The Passion of the Christ
1728,salvatoreleonegta3,accurate,10,28 February 2004,"After reading the review that this website gave and seeing the movie, the critic who reviewed this movie is not accurate. They stated that when Jesus was whipped was laughable. Apparently this person has not read the Bible. The Bible is not clear on the part of Jesus standing up, but this was to show that he is not going to give in to the pain. There is a lot of this in the movie, if the critic would open his imagination, he would understand that sometimes a director uses this to express certain emotions in the movie. But Jesus did get forty lashes with a whip that had small spikes in it. Christians should see this movie to relay what they have read in the Bible, to see what it was actually like for Jesus, and what He went through for us. Non Christians should also see this movie to see what the Christians ""Lord"" went through for the world. Many people do not believe that Jesus was the Son of God, or that he even existed. These types of people should take a deep look at historical facts, facts not theory like evolution, and see what the Christian faith is about.

1729,spalla2,Passion in its goriest form,10,28 February 2004,"Well I saw this film after reading reviews from the net...I need to find out what's this film all about and how inspiring it can be.. The whole film can be summarized in three bloodfilled sequences...the first phase deals with lashing Jesus of Nazareth with all forms of brutal whips..the second deals with jesus carrying the cross and a long ordeal follows...the third is a detailed crucification....after watching the movie i realized how hateful a human being can be for no reason...how cruel the consequences will be when the psycho within a person is unleashed...i imagined for a while in place of jesus being lashed and crucified and it sent shivers down my spine...why was only one person chosen to redeem  us all  for all our sins? If every person has a freewill power, why do some people dominate over others? Why is so much injustice still prevailing in this world and whats the use of all the passion or sufferings of christ? Why are handicapped people born thus denying them their freewill to walk or see.

1730,lizzyyates,Mel Nails it!,10,2 March 2004,"This movie will leave you speechless and stunned. The acting is superb, the aramaic is poetic, and the message is meaningful.The Passion occurs within the context of Jesus' last 12 hours of life and the viewer must understand this context to appreciate what Mel Gibson has done.Gibson does a masterful job of portraying the struggle Jesus deals with. The movie depicts Jesus and his willful, knowing choice to go through horrific suffering in order to save mankind. The movie shows not only the physical and emotional turmoil of the final hours while depicting the ultimate courage and strength Jesus shows in bringing the ultimate purpose for his life-the salvation of all people by dying for their sins.The movie is not for the faint of heart-it depicts the end of Jesus's life in a violent and graphic form true to the gospels and traditions. This violence, while unnerving, leaves one confronted with the reality that it was endured for a purpose- for the salvation of all including the viewer.
This movie is truly praiseworthy!",The Passion of the Christ
1731,homerjayhawks81,A Lasting Impression,10,28 February 2004,"This is a very well made movie.  It created a lasting impression on me that has altered the way I think about life.  I can't really explain it. Regardless of your religious background, I strongly recommend that you see this movie.  Hopefully you will see it in the theater. Mel Gibson claims the movie is based solely on the 4 gospels in the bible.  I am not catholic but it is very obvious that the movie is also based on the 14 stations of the cross.  It is also very focused on Mary for a lot of the movie.  This would be my only complaint about the movie.  The focus on the ""passion of Mary"" takes away from the film's main focus, ""The Passion of the Christ"".  Some would argue that this is history and should not be ignored in a historically accurate film.  If the movie was based on the 4 gospels, Mary's role should have been downplayed in the film from what the catholics believe.  This is because her role in the gospels is rarely emphasized (although there is no doubt in my mine that she was truly an amazing woman).  Don't let any of this keep you from seeing the movie because regardless of your religious background you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
1732,supergravitino,An Inspiring Multidimensional Masterpiece,10,29 February 2004,"A well crafted movie (screenplay, acting, cinematography, sound, score, costume, makeup, visual effects, direction, and production) that faithfully depicts the last hours of Jesus Christ (mainly) according to the New Testament. Mel demonstrates his mastery of moviemaking. The movie is an inspiring multidimensional masterpiece. It strikes the spectators with many different kinds and levels of impressions. Mel does not make another superficial movie on the biography of Jesus (that we all know), but rather concentrates on the most critical and dramatic moments of Jesus' life using the most powerful tools of cinema. Those tragic moments are pictured with intense graphic scenes perhaps to emphasize the atrocity of hate, greed, pride, envy, wrath, etc. that divide humanity and keep us from living in harmony. From a shallow view, the realism seems exaggerated but from a deeper perspective it illustrates not only the barbarity of the Romans and the suffering of The Son of God, but also the cruelty of all the barbarians and the agony of all the faithful who followed Christ on the Cross through the ages. While watching the crucifixion, the question that popped in my mind was not: Who killed Jesus? But rather: Are we living by Jesus' words or are we still crucifying Christ with our way of living?",The Passion of the Christ
1733,sunnyd96,Great Film that everyone should see.,10,29 February 2004,"I was just amazed at what a powerful and epic film that was. I think everyone should see this movie, believers and non-believers alike. If you are familiar with the story of Christ's crucifixion, it puts it into a whole new perspective seeing it so vividly. I really like the fact the film was in Aremaic and Latin, it adds to the historical accuracy of the film and it also allows you to feel like you actually there during that time. There times during the movie i just wanted to jump up out my seat and cry for them to stop what they were doing. If you are a Christian and know Christ this movie will strengthen your love for him tenfold. Even if you are not a Christian the message of love in this film is so strong and overwhelming that you should leave the theatres with a renewed since of brotherhood for your fellow humans.",The Passion of the Christ
1734,mary58,"Beautiful, Heartbreaking, Brilliant",10,28 February 2004,"It is difficult to speak about this work as a film production, without sounding somehow small.  The subject so overpowers the viewer, that is seems as if one is watching not a film, but a glimpse at the actual suffering and death of Jesus.This perception would not be so without the physical beauty of the film, the terrible scenes of heartbreaking brutality and the absolutely brilliant naturalness of the actors.Jim Caviezel delivers a luminous, suffering Jesus.  Maia Morgenstern lives the agony of a mother watching her son die.  Monica Bellucci as Magdalen is desperate in her grief.Mel Gibson has delivered a masterpiece which needs to be viewed again and again.",The Passion of the Christ
1735,ao682,Much Better Than I Had Anticipated,10,28 February 2004,"Yes, it had it's so-called ""violence"", but what did the critics expect to see when a man is whipped and crucified?  I must have seen dozens much more violent movies over the years.  I didn't find myself being offended by the type of violence in this movie.  And the anti-semitism thing?  Didn't see any of that at all.  Not only is Christ himself Jewish, but many of his supporters in the movie are Jewish.  The Jewish children-turned-devils who taunted Judas to his death?  To me, that seemed to be more a product of Judas's own schizo-mind and tormented conscience, all caused by the realization of what he had done.But ultimately, in fairness to Judas and the Jewish elders and the ugly mob and Pontius Pilate and the Roman executioners, it is mankind as a whole who is responsible for the death.  Jesus himself tells his disciples during one of the movie's flashbacks, that it he himself who would be giving his life, and not that his life would be taken from him.I found the movie to be very intense, emotional, and moving.  And somehow, it worked to be uplifting.  I'm not sure why, but afterward, though somewhat stunned, I felt relief and hope - not sure yet about what, but definately, those feelings where there.  I feel I want to know more about this person Jesus.  At the very very least, even if he was just a man, and willingly let himself be put to death for the love of his fellow man, to demonstrate by example that a man can truly love his fellow man - this alone I find uplifting and redeeming.Everyone should go into this movie with an open mind and open heart.  The movie is absolutely not about putting down any of the peoples of this planet.  It's about trying to inspire us to improve our plight on this little planet.",The Passion of the Christ
1736,pinkpixie421,an outstanding film,10,29 February 2004,"The Passion of the Christ is an outstanding film; I would recommend everyone go and see it if they haven't already. It's very heart wrenching, and sends an extremely powerful message. There wasn't one person in the theater who didn't have a tear in their eyes. Mel Gibson did an extraordinary job bringing out this story and turning it into reality. Many people will be touched both emotionally and spiritually by this film, something that the people of this nation, of the entire world, need.Though some people may mock the beliefs laid out in this film, it will make a difference in the end.",The Passion of the Christ
1737,dominic-53,May seem gruesome and depressing. . . . but not really!,10,29 February 2004,"Although, 95% of this film is depressing and hard to swallow, the climax, conlusion, and ultimate victory that is achieved, takes all depressing feelings, and all sense of loss, and replaces them with gratitude and love. This view can only be shared with one who knows the history and reason behind Jesus's life. Reviews so far have really been mixed, and for the most part the reviewer either knows the background and understands the ultimate sacrifice Jesus Christ made, or just reviews this film as another film in their repetative seemingly endless job; while not knowing or realizing the true nature this film is hiding. In order to realize the true depth and meaning of the film, one should do further research on the backround and meaning of Jesus's life. One doesn't have to believe that Jesus was the Messiah, or that God even exists. But to understand the meaning of this film, all one would have to do is realize that Jesus did walk the earth 2000 years ago, and Jesus did go through what the film tries to recreate. In the end this film is great, but only when one realizes that this film is not just the death of Jesus, but the passion, triumph and resurrection of Jesus.",The Passion of the Christ
1738,gnordquist,What this world needed..,10,29 February 2004,"Thank Goodness, just what the world needed, reflection on God on Jesus and morality, forgiveness and love. In these times when you see mostly PG-13 thru R rated movies due to sex, profanity, drug use etc. this is a movie can could NOT be made without because of it's importance. A real ligitimate rated R film and blood and gore not for the audience to get grossed out like most teen-slasher movies but a movie to help the world understand the meaning of what it really means when we hear ""Christ died for our sins"" something that i think many have become immuned to hearing, like it lost it's value in understanding what Christ has sacraficed and experienced for the sake of all of us. I myself have known what Christ did for us but after seeing this movie, I feel ashamed of not really appreciating what Christ really went through. I hear of people coming out the theaters feeling somber and speechless for a while, us too, I guess it's because you feel like you actually walked with Christ during his crucifiction and that's not something you kind of just shrug off afterward. I wonder if this was sent to us as a sort of modern day miracle?, it would make sense coming to us in movie form, but then again in this day and age, it makes sense.",The Passion of the Christ
1739,lmhall-2,One of the most gripping and true movies about Christ,10,29 February 2004,"I highly recommend this film as a true to life film that has finally been made about the last hours of Christ for todays world.  How can we begin to convey just what Christ did for us in a movie today without being very graphic.  We all have been subjected to MASS amounts of ""blood and guts"" for years, so a trivialized ""clean"" crucifixion would have been a farce.  The controversy over Christians feeling ill will towards the Jews is beyond comprehension.  God sent Christ to this world for just the purpose of being sacrificed for ALL of us, including the Jews.  We rejoice in the fact that we have love in our hearts for all because he was sent and pray and hope that ALL mankind in this world can know that he WAS and IS the savior, even the Jews.",The Passion of the Christ
1740,shinesbrightly,"I would not call it violent, I call it painful.",10,29 February 2004,"I would like to commend the movie on the following aspects: In the film Jesus was portrayed as a very strong man even though physically weak.  I did not come out of the film thinking it was violent.  I felt it was painful, which is something that cannot be ignored.  I felt it was true to the written word (as close as it could be) and commend Mel Gibson for making such a powerful movie. Raised in the church, I never realized the intense pain that Christ suffered during his last day.  It was hard to watch as pain was inflicted upon him.  I remember thinking, surely they can't use such a devise to beat him and then they did.  It was a very powerful and emotional movie and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.",The Passion of the Christ
1741,daring1972,"Powerful, moving, fantastic!",6,29 February 2004,"Finally, there is a film that does it right.  For years I have yearned for a movie where truth meets artistry.  The Passion of The Christ is a powerful telling of the tremendous sacrifice that Jesus made for humanity.  The violence is completely necessary to the telling of this story.  There is a huge difference between meaningless violence and MEANINGFUL violence.
The power of the film comes from the passionate telling of this amazing story that is truly the crux of human existence.  The portrayal of Satan is very well done, hauntingly so.  I got goosebumps while watching him question Jesus in the garden and when he ""slithers"" through the crowd of onlookers. I have always admired James Caviezel and love his awesome performance of Jesus.  It may be a dream, but I hope that next year, Jim is left holding a Golden Boy for that one!You owe it to yourself (no matter your personal beliefs) to see this movie and ask yourself, ""What do I really believe?"".   Or as Pilot asks in the film, ""What is truth?""Jesus died for the redemption of all mankind.  His gift of eternal life is available to us all.  Will you accept or reject Him?  A guilty man may very well die for what he has done, but will an innocent man die for what another has done?

The `Passion' is the truth and shows how Christ gives his unconditional love (so much that he was willing to die for all our wrong doings) for each and every one of us.  Prior to seeing this movie, all I heard from the media was that this was a very `controversial' movie.  It is a sad case in our society when the truth becomes the center-point of controversy, while lies, deception, and fictitious thoughts are the focal points by which many people decide to live their lives.  I'm not sure how this movie will rate with the ""Hollywood Elitist,"" but for people that believe in the truth, it should do very well.",The Passion of the Christ

Before seeing the movie, I'd heard that the violence was ""too much""  but I whole-heartedly disagree. It was violent, yes, but not more than what I had expected;I heard stories of people leaving the theatre because it was unbearable, but I know the story - maybe they didn't? The truth is violent & this movie, I found, was accurate with the details - including the beginning when Jesus' sweat was blood...another historical fact.However true, I wonder if Christ fell from cross as many times as was depicted - - that part seemed to be a little drawn....Otherwise, an excellent depiction.",The Passion of the Christ

Is there some gray area?  Yes, but there always will be.  Those who are closed to the promise of life after death won't speak too highly of, or find much substance to this production.  For the rest of us the film is a beautiful reminder of God's promise. On 60 Minutes Andy ""Looney"" asked the question: ""I wonder how much money Mel Gibson plans to make on the crucifixion of Christ?""  Where were the comments on money making during the release of films about the Holocaust, i.e. Schindlers List, etc?  Time for Rooney to go, his schtich is all worn out.

The feeling I had walking out of the theater was that of unworthiness.  I know the story of the crusifiction well but this movie just brought it all home. The way that Mel Gibson protrayed the Roman soldiers taking pleasure in scorging Jesus Christ was probably very accurate.  There were, I admit, a couple of scenes that literally made me gasp but again, I felt humbled by the fact that Jesus suffered so much for all of us.  Probably the most heart wrenching scenes for me were with his mother, Mary.  I guess I never gave much thought to the fact that she watched her son suffer such a horrifying death and, as a mother, I wept along with her.I will definitely see the movie again and will, no doubt, purchase it when it comes out on DVD.",The Passion of the Christ

I really feel that ""Hollywood"" should stand up and take notice, I feel the majority is tried of what ""Hollywood"" keeps putting out.  They should have jumped at the chance to produce this movie. Mr. Gibson went out on a limb to produce this movie, although I am sure that his rewards will be beyond measure.  This movie will inspire anyone who views the pain Jesus went through for all of us.

When Mel Gibson Made this movie he must have been thinking that the world needs to wake up and realize that life isn't a fantasy but real things like this really happened.I am very grateful to Mel Gibson for reminding  the people that this is the way it was, even though it was a very upsetting thing to watch.I cried almost all through the whole movie and so did most everyone else that i talked to.",The Passion of the Christ

1751,freddee,excellent film,10,29 February 2004,Passion is a term that refers to the suffering of Christ ending with his crucifiction. This film has given us a compelling visual of Christ's Passion that agrees with other renditions seen in other movies and as described in the Gospels. This film is a complete success in depicting these important events.This film has been criticized for being too violent. There have been many films that use violence to illustrate a point. The violence is necessary for us to understand the degree of suffering in the Passion.As for charges of anti-Semetism ... that is completely ridiculous. I was unable to see anything of that sort in this film. This film is only anti-Semetic if the Gospels are and I find that notion incredibly offensive.,The Passion of the Christ

Or being called a Jesus Freak?  Nothing I could go through could ever compare to what He did for me. If there is ever a movie you must see, this is the one.  It is amazing how it draws you into it, takes you back to that time and you now feel a part of the onlookers.

The Jews smote Jesus, not the Romans.  And they pulled out his beard to disgrace him (Isaiah 50.6).  The violence didn't nearly cover the degree that Jesus was violated.  The bible says you could not recognize Him.  In that respect, Mel showed restraint. The movie was poignant.  There were a few things that weren't biblical, but nothing to change the meaning.  I thought that it was in Aramaic and Latin made it everyone's film.  Don't miss the opportunity to see what your Savior has done for you. Thank you, Jesus!",The Passion of the Christ

This is why Christ was born, and died as it is written in JOHN 3:16.Religious fanatic, no I am not.

We went to see The Passion this afternoon and I can honestly say I was worried because of all the hype on many websites and on TV and in the newspaper. I am so happy I went to see the movie. Was the movie brutal? Yes, it was! But I think it did the job...I was already a christian and this movie gave me a visual to contemplate on. Mel Gibson did an amazing job of making this movie and it was awesome!When i watched this movie I did not see anti-semitism. I think if thats all people saw then their ignorant. The message was so deep and I think ALL people were portrayed in a bad light, not just the Jews. The were ALL for their own interests and serving the emperor.SO, I will not be reading anymore reviews because I think truly mature people will watch this movie for the overall message about what Jesus has done for humanity.When I left the movie, i couldn't even speak and I felt everything around me was so superficial. There is so much hurt in the world that people need movies like The Passion...instead of movies like ""Kill Bill"" Which contain useless violence and are not critisized nearly as much as The Passion is. I will never listen to another critic EVER. Let us always look with an open mind to others views and judge movies for ourselves.Oh and I noticed many questions on here about Jesus and faith etc etc. I can tell you....please do not get your answers from people online! Read authentic books, ask a priest, pastor etc. No one is perfect and sometimes people are just not qualified to provide accurate information. I studied for years before I decided to become a Catholic. Just cause thats for me doesn't make it for everyone. I am now 25 years old and realize the only way to make it in life is to judge not and treat others with kindness even though we may not recieve the same in return.Thanks for reading.

It was His mission. His words ""It is accomplished."" make that very clear.  By His sacrifice, by His Blood He bought each and every Christian who has ever lived, those who live now and all those who will ever live back from the second death. Mr. Gibson has given us a picture of events that changed history.  The saying a picture is worth a thousand words is true.

Two words come to mind when thinking about how to summarize this motion picture: Love and sacrifice.  I believe these words aptly summarize both the subject of the film and its director.  The story of Christ's love and sacrifice for all of us is one that has been told countless times.  Never have I seen the manifestation of His sacrifice so vividly depicted.  I commend Mel Gibson for his faith, his vision and his courage.  It's sad to hear so many people miss the point of this film.  Even some Christian leaders have spoken out picking apart this film scene by scene, all the while missing their opportunity to focus and expound on the pure love that Jesus Christ has for us.  A love so great, he endured a pain that most of us, thank God, will never have to endure.  It is obvious this was the part of the story Gibson wanted us to appreciate and though it was difficult to watch at times, I am so glad I witnessed it. If you haven't seen this movie, please do.

I have never seen an audience so quiet @ a movie theater.This movie is guaranteed to stir emotion within one. After watching this movie there is nothing that even suggests it is anti-semitic. Anyone who does suggest that needs to find a better way to spend their time.I would highly recommend watching this movie.

It really tells the story of the Passion, and is not some sterilized account.  The graphic nature of the film is needed to drive the story home.  The Crucifixion of Jesus was not pretty, neither is this movie; however the excluding of such horrific images would destroy the overwhelming power of the film. Although, it does depict the Jewish High Priests as the people who insisted on Jesus' execution, I did not sense anti-Semitism.  In fact, by looking at the reaction of the priests to the scourging, the effect on the witnesses, and the constant reminders of Jesus enduring the sufferings for the forgiveness of all sins, the movie does not blame the Jews or the Romans; it is the fault of all sinners that Jesus chose to endure this suffering.  To think that the movie is anti-Semitic, is as ignorant as believing the criticism of the movie is anti-Catholic or anti-Christian.",The Passion of the Christ
1762,gatewaygestes,Amazing,10,1 March 2004,"Wow!  This movie has SO MUCH from start to finish.I have read the reviews about ""historical inaccuracies"". People have said that there is too much attention focused on the violence of the punishment and crucifixion rather than the ministry of Christ.  But it is my belief that Mr Gibson intended exactly that...to enlighten us as to the magnificence of Christ's sacrifice.  I have also read that in this movie Pilate was portrayed as having too much ""compassion""...that if it hadn't been for the Jewish leaders (who by the way incited the Jewish people into their riotous and hateful behavior) he might have let Christ off with a simple scourging.  It is believed by some that this might enflame anti-Jewish sentiment.  Well, after seeing the movie (and planning to see it again) I can honestly say that no one in our group had any specific animosity towards the Jewish people.  We realize that the Jewish people were merely playing a part in God's plan for mankind....and that the sin of all mankind is what ultimately sent Jesus to the cross.  Lastly, I think rather than trying to tell the whole story of Christ's earthly ministry, Mr. Gibson wanted to convey the impact of the crucifixion in hopes that it would lead to further discussion and investigation into God's inspired Word, including the life of Jesus Christ.This movie has it all, the love, the hatred, the condemnation, the innocence, the compassion....won't go into details.

All of the jews and romans were generalized and cartoon character bad guys. The use of subtitles here was completely useless and gratituous, as this film does not really rely on a historical context any more than the bible allows.  Subtitles does not make this any more powerful, drawing you into the film any more than english would have.  What it really looks like is traditional catholic paintings of the stations of the cross.  Another annoyance:  Jesus, Mary, and Magdeline are all caucasian actors, whereas all of the disciples and the rest of the jews look the way they 'should' in accordance with geographic and historical factors.  Why?  This movie is preaching to the choir and quite disappointing.",The Passion of the Christ
1764,cutshawwr,Amazing,10,1 March 2004,"Many times we take things for grant it, and life is one of them. To see Jesus on the cross and giving his life for others and myself, it makes you stop and think how lucky we are to be able to live each day to the fullest. This film is a must see. It is one thing to read about the death of Jesus but to see it on the big screen is another. The movie actually will help you feel the pain, which was inflicted on Jesus, every blow with a whip to the spear going in his side. I can say that this movie shows the awesome power that God can generate. How he sent his only son to take the beatings, put him on that cross and saved us from the evil in this world. I feel that it is a great teaching tool for young people to see a life they should live and what Jesus was put through. I have seen the movie twice and each time I feel that it cleans my soul more and more each time. Praise be to God for what he has sent Mel Gibson to produce.",The Passion of the Christ

However, with that being said, I will state that this movie should be seen by EVERY ADULT before they die.  This movie was the greatest movie that I have ever seen. For any doubters that the accounts of the film are not accurate, see the film and judge it  yourself, but don't judge it until you've seen it.  I have never experienced such emotion and compasion in my entire life.  THIS IS NOT A HATE FILM, but a film about unconditional love and forgiveness.  Even if you are not a religious person, I recomend that you see this film if nothing else to witness the greatest piece of film art the world has ever known.

After giving my life to Christ in January of 2003, I have been actively pursuing my relationship with Him. This movie is an awesome representation of what happened almost 2000 years ago. I am extremely happy that this movie got into the mainstream cinemas. I am thankful for everyone who prayed for this film to be recieved well and the effort of everyone involved. This movie brought to vivid life what people have, for centuries, only read about. It brings the passion of our lord to the screen with terrific colors. The fact that millions of non-believers and people who have lost their faith will be allowed to view this picture is such an awesome evangical tool. I encourage all Christians to invite anyone and everyone to see this film. I do not recommend this film for any children due to the graphic violence that Christ endured. I cried three time while watching this film even though I knew what happened already. The movie achieved its goal of bringing the Word of God to the Secular masses in a way in which it would be greatly recieved.",The Passion of the Christ
1767,agent_x68,Misguided Passion,1,4 March 2004,"Mel Gibson takes the low road with this movie. Sure, he accomplishes his goal of generating a vibrant buzz about the film, but his method of over-the-top and prolonged gore leaves much to be desired. To appeal simply to our emotional and primitive senses as opposed to attempting to deliver a movie with substance and thought is the easy way out.Who is not aware already that Jesus (man or Messiah) was beaten, tortured and crucified? Is it important to know/see the EXACT blow by blow method that was used? Or is important to know what His message was and what it means to us? To me, this was a documentary on the brutal mindset and techniques of punishment of that era. A more effective approach would have been to BUILD to this point with a story of Jesus's teachings and life and THEN show the brutal moments of His punishment. As physically horrific as the method of His mortal death was (as it was for countless other innocent victims of prejudice/hate of the past), it's irrelevant compared to the bigger picture of His life and teachings.  After all, the mortal death of Jesus was all part of The Plan, was it not?In the end, I felt sad. Sad that anybody would have to endure such punishment (of which I was already aware); Sad that mankind (oxymoron?) is capable of creating and delivering such brutality (aware of that as well); but mostly sad that Mel Gibson had to resort to such low tactics to awaken or renew our spirituality. I wonder if we've progressed at all in 2000 years.",The Passion of the Christ
1768,gmendonc,Excellent flick,10,3 March 2004,"No matter what your agenda might be, this film is a winner.  Yes, it's heavy on the violence but it's not gratuitous and I've seen far worse in other movies.  Main story aside, everything else is wonderfully done, from the cinematography to the acting to the location, you actually feel like you're in Israel during Roman times.  You may think that is no big deal because there are many movies with these qualities coming out of Hollywood, not religious films.  My experience has been that most religious films come out with some obvious flaw that makes them feel hokey.  Not this one this one is grade A.  Don't think I would take the kids but it's a must see for anyone over 18.",The Passion of the Christ
1769,galex55,I love to see a good movie,10,1 March 2004,"""The Passion of Christ"" is a wonderful piece of cinematic art, on the same level with the works of masters of other media:  Rembrandt, Da Vinci, Michelangelo.  It is a faithful account of the Gospel message, with all the pathos and drama that a movie of this genre should have.  Recommended to all mature audiences, whether their minds are open or closed.  Charges of anti-semitism and hidden agendas behind Mel Gibson's purpose in making this movie are easily refuted.  This movie will shock your being, stir your soul, challenge your mind, soften your heart and water your eyes.  It is not meant to ask the question of, or provide the answer for, who killed Jesus, but to make the viewer inquire deeply into his soul to find the answers to the more profound questions humanity has grappled with for millenia.  That is why this movie is a must see for everyone.",The Passion of the Christ
1770,forrealman,His Sacrifice,10,1 March 2004,"Not enough words to express my gratitude to Mel Gibson and Icon for showing a truthful depiction of Jesus in the final hours of His Tremendous Sacrifice for us. An excellent movie! Necessary, and, I hope and pray, will cause people to realize His Love for us and put their faith in Him for Salvation from death and hell. To Mel Gibson, thank you, for not being afraid to speak, for not keeping quiet, as the Lord had said to Paul (Acts 18:9-10): ""Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city."" Once, standing on a hill, about to preach, I became afraid, and I sat, closed my eyes to pray for strength, my Bible on my lap, and the wind blew the pages as I prayed, and when I finished, I opened my eyes and saw that verse right away; it was written in red letters, the only red letters on that page of my Bible. So, I stood up and preached. First, ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"" Romans 3:23 Next, Salvation is provided: ""Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed"" I Peter 2:24 Salvation is offered: ""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the GIFT of GOD"" Ephesians 2:8 ""For the wages of sin is death; but the GIFT of GOD is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord"" Romans 6:23 ""That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou SHALT BE SAVED. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."" Romans 10:9-10 We cannot save ourselves from our sins through works any more than we can remove sin from our bodies. It takes the Blood Sacrifice of the Lamb of God to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and make us new creatures. When you accept Christ as your Saviour, He comes in, and God sees Him in you, and you at that moment are made perfect in His eyes because Christ is perfect, and the sin that eats away this old human flesh will not be eating away your spirit, which God will save for your glorified body. The GIFT of GOD is ETERNAL LIFE! ETERNAL LIFE! TO BE WITH HIM!! The thief on the cross next to Jesus was saved at that last moment before physical death because of his faith in Christ; he called upon His name and Christ knew his heart. God wants us to choose Him; He gives us that choice to make. Your life will change when you accept Christ as your Saviour, it will, I promise. And the burden of the Christian life is much lighter than the burden of bearing and paying your own sins that you can never pay in full and will therefore be paying eternally through spiritual death and hell. (If this is not true, then you have nothing to lose by not accepting Christ. If this is true, and it is, then you have everything to lose by not accepting Christ as your Saviour.)Finally, to summarize, God uses man to spread His message. Whether or not the film succeeds or fails in showing Jesus with brown hair or black hair or curly hair or straight hair, or long hair or short hair, or makes Him recognizable to us by equating His features to familiar paintings of the past that is based more perhaps on speculation isn't as important as the message conveyed of His Sacrifice and His words being spoken to us, and His Purpose, to save us. The Blood Sacrifice was necessary, but even the film wasn't as horrible as the actual event, and was merciful to the average audience watching. And the actual spiritual suffering for the sins of all mankind is much worse than just the physical pain and suffering, and visually it would be impossible to do justice in showing what actually He went through for us. Finally, thank You, Jesus, for Your Sacrifice, to save us from what we all deserve, eternal damnation, and thank You for Your Mercy, which endures forever, and Your Love.An excellent movie. Five stars! Go see it, but also, study the Word for yourself, and realize your life here is short, you have time to make your choice, and live by the choice you make. You have time to get to know Jesus now, or never know Him. You have time to accept His Gift or reject it. But the older you get, the shorter you realize your life here is. You realize how fast just ten years can go by, twenty, thirty, and each day passing is one more day given to you to make a choice, to choose Christ. How many more days will you be given? Please, if you're not sure that you're saved, call upon Jesus to save you. Trust in Him now, before another day is taken. Don't live another day in uncertainty. Receive His Gift of eternal life!",The Passion of the Christ
1771,cundwater,The resurrection,10,1 March 2004,"Mel Gibson should have showed a little bit more of the resurrection.  Most people do not know the full story- so he should have at least brought Jesus to the point of meeting with the disciples again.Really, the whole story is meaningless without the resurrection, since his death and the coming back to life to go to heaven were the only reason that he allowed his torture and death to occur in the first place.I think that he could have spent at least 5 or 10 extra minutes on that part.",The Passion of the Christ
1772,imdb-3161,Brutally Honest; Extremely Effective; Major Masquerra Alert,10,1 March 2004,"Never before has the extreme brutality of the scrouging and cruxification of Christ been more honestly and accruately displayed on the big screen. It requires a strong constitution to endure to the end. I've seen grown men weeping through this movie.The basic goal of this film is the show Christ's passion to accomplish what His Father ordained of Him. Showing the Passion, this movie does well. Although, some folks question if all the violence was needed, I personally believe it was. I've seen too many epic Bible-based stories that only glance over the brutality or skipped it entirely. This is NOT a G rated Bible story, this is the hard-core, real-deal.As far as the plot goes, most folks should know how the story goes. If you've read the Book (the Bible, specifically the Gospels), the many references and assumptions won't bother you much, but if you are unfamiliar with the life of Christ, you might be lost -- although I think there is enough back-flashes to help fill in the background of the story.I don't know of many folks that have watched this without a strong emotional response. Most folks either absolutely love it or hate it. If you a devote Christian, this film should deepen that faith -- as with me. I did not see anything anti-Jewish here. From a Christian point-of-view, this reinforced that we ALL put Christ on the cross.Basically, I can never read the Gospels in the same maner ever again.",The Passion of the Christ

1774,angkw2002,"Awestruck, Numbing, Created a renewal of my faith in Christ",10,1 March 2004,"Excitement, Anticipation, Uncertainty, Fear...just a few of the emotions my mind toggled with between first hearing about it, listening to the media frenzy via airwaves, reading the articles and watching the making of what could and would be a worldwide spiritual awakening.  I got goosebumps just thinking about the possibilities of this film.  I actually went to see The Passion of The Christ, this past weekend, alas, my mind and heart are at ease and peace...I feel based on the Gospels as I know them, Mel Gibson depicted a story, unpolished and very surreal of the world, man, and the sacrifice made for me!  Amazing Love, oh what sacrifice...the son of God given for me...my death he paid and my death he died what love is this?...what love is this?  One of my favorite songs but the words are so true.  I always knew violence existed and evil goes back to the garden...I don't believe I ever imagined a violence so horrific, so unthinkable to the one who came to redeem us all.  Two days later, I am still numb and my mind is lurking into every open forum I can find about this film.  I want to know how others were affected...believers and nonbelievers, those who have questions, those who aren't certain who Christ is or how He can change their lives.  I have a renewed sense of my faith and find myself wanting to be more like Him...to search for more answers to feed myself with new knowledge so I may share with others His saving grace!In recent years I found I allowed myself through various life situations to stray from the relationship I once had not to very long ago...I am grateful for the courage and for the talent that went into the making of this film and whose characters should feel honored as well as recognize the impact they have now placed on millions of lives.  My heart wept for Mary, as a mother, I could only imagine the pain, yet knowing His purpose was not of this earth.  The eyes of this Christ were so piercing but in a compassionate and loving way...it was gripping, I was in awe, I will never be the same and I pray that everyone who sees this movie will see it for what is truly is about and not what any religion, newscast, or Hollywood actor/producer claims or hails it to be.  I am grateful that Mel Gibson first and foremost came to know the Lord as his personal savior.  I am also thankful he has been given the courage and the means to come out with such a bold statement of his faith and belief and wrap it all up on the big screen...wow!

The whole sight, sounds and feelings of this picture will go down in history as one of the best movies ever made. Yes this movie is violent and yes this movie is gruesome but the differance between this movie and other violent movies is that there was a reason for all the violence and bloodshedding that this Man went through. In a world of entertainment that has tons of movies, tv shows and video games that depict for the desiring eyes, senseless acts of violence it is great to see such a talented and gifted person (Mel Gibson) standing up for his beliefs and producing a movie like this that is so inspiring and can lead the viewer to Him who gives healing, peace and hope to a insecure and hopeless world.

1776,tgannaway,An enthusiastic thumbs up,10,1 March 2004,"""The Passion of the Christ"" -- though not (in my opinion) suitable for children or the faint of heart -- is the most emotionally powerful portrayal of the final hours of Christ that I have ever witnessed. Both visually rich and yet excruciating, it contains moments of artistic license that flesh out the humanity of Christ, while at the same time remains congruent with the harmony of the Gospels.  ""The Passion"" brings us inexorably face to face with the Gospel essentials -- that Jesus bled and died for our sins, and was Resurrected.Anyone who experiences this film will never read the Passion story with the same eyes or heart again.",The Passion of the Christ
1777,waterskierboy,Should change the title,6,1 March 2004,"This is obviously a disturbing movie as it is a disturbing story.  I feel the movie was very realistic and did a great job showing us the suffering Jesus endured to save us from sin.  However, the Passion of Jesus Christ is a story of love, commitment, spirituality, miracles, brotherhood, faith, ultimately a story of hope.  Not one second of this movie did I feel hopeful, loved, or spiritual.  The miracle of the resurrection was merely 15 seconds of the film.  I feel this is a very irresponsible depiction of the Passion and misses the point of the story COMPLETELY.  If this movie was entitled The Crucifiction, the story was well done.  This story runs MUCH deeper than violence and gut wrenching agony.  Please, Mel, if you are telling the story of The Passion of Christ, show the passion Christ had for life, his Lord, his deciples, us as humans.  Violence is definately not what Christ would want us to remember and focus on.",The Passion of the Christ

I liked this movie because I believe it sends a message about Jesus for people to learn more about him. I do not believe this movie is for children to see, it is for a mature audience. I don't believe this movie was made to criticize anyones beliefs. I believe it was just Mel Gibson's vision in his mind of what Jesus had to go through.

1780,dougndebb-1,This movie should get an Academy Award....,10,1 March 2004,"I thought this movie was wonderful!  The costumes, editing, directing, cinematography, soundtrack, everything was great!  Anyone who knows anything about the Bible can see that this movie follows it to a ""T"" (except a few liberties to fill in minor holes such as Jesus reacting with His mother just before dinner).  I just didn't see where this movie could be portrayed as anti-semitic.  People who claim that must not have seen it.  Clearly it showed there were a group of Jewish leaders who were corrupt and wanted Jesus dead for their own personal  gain, but it also showed other Jewish leaders who stood up to the corruption and were escorted (forced to leave) out of the trial.  Also, the film showed many other Jewish people (the disciples, Mary Magdalene, Mary Jesus' mother, Simon of Cyrene, etc.) who didn't want Him dead (the fact is that it was God's plan all along that He had to die to save those who believe in Him).  I loved the fact that the movie was in Latin and Aramaic with English subtitles.

I was impressed with the authenistiy of the violence of the Romans which is Comparable with the Gladiator as far as viciousness.  The film did not even come close to the violence of Kill Bill. The story of strength and love for Christ was very evident in this film and the languages added to the authentisity.  Mr. Gibson did a good job depicting the power struggle of the Sanhidren and Pilate.  I read through the four Gospels from the Garden to the Resurection.  It amazed me how accurate he made the films in comparason to the gospels.  The film doesn't assign guilt.  If anything it shows that the Sanhidren may have recognized their mistake in which they could have reconcilled with the God of Abraham, Jacob, and Issac.  If I were in their place I may have had made the same choice.  The Jews that called for Barabas were calling for a freedom fighter someone who had a track record of fighting the Romans, I might have made the same choice.

I have been a Christian a long time and was raised in church so i knew the story but never have i ever experienced it like i did through this movie.  it felt like i was actually there because it was so real.  but it humbled me to my soul to know that Christ went through all that suffering and pain and agony without ever a complaint and He did it for me that i could have eternal life.  what a story!  the graphic violence was a bit hard to watch and at times i was almost begging for it to stop but it is a story that needs to be told and i hope and pray that everyone gets a chance to watch it and let it change your life.,The Passion of the Christ
1783,jeffanddee,Beautiful imagery,10,2 March 2004,"I have to say, I don't attend movies in the theater often, but this was one movie I have been highly recommending people to see.  Mel Gibson did an absolutely awesome job with the story of 'The Passion'.  I was preparing myself for gruesome as described by others who had commented on the film, and what I saw was anything but.  It was hard to watch the senseless beating and crucifixion of Christ, but it made me understand all the more the love God and Jesus have for ME!  In my discussion with my husband we agreed that the point that bothers people in general is the fact that when you watch an action film and people are blown to bits - and you see just as much blood - it's justified.  In The Passion it's not and that's why people are having such a hard time dealing with the violence and blood.The story opening with the evil one, who was neither beautiful nor ugly, but just compelling enough to make you want to look more - totally described how sin is in the world.  It's just enticing enough to make you want to know/see more and then you are drawn in before you know what hit you - Mel hit that one right on the head with his casting/developing of that character.  The flashbacks made you feel as though you were right there going through it with Jesus.  They made you feel the pain and compassion his mother Mary was suffering (as well as the disciples).The two points that stuck out to me the most would be the image of God crying and the showering of Christ's blood on the soldier - to signify that we all are covered by his blood to be made clean before God.I was originally concerned that the subtitles might take away from my viewing pleasure - they were anything but distracting.  And hearing it in Aramaic made it all the more real to me.Thank you Mel Gibson, for putting a film together that will shake people up for a long time!  It helps believers to come to a closer understanding of God's love for us, and hopefully will help those who do not yet believe, or have a 'dabbling' in their faith, to become strong believers!  God be praised!",The Passion of the Christ
1784,GrinnenTL,Words don't do it justice...,10,2 March 2004,"When I first heard about the `Passion' movie, I didn't know if I really wanted to see it or not. Coming from Mel Gibson, it seemed to me to be some cheesy Hollywood movie. But recently,  I saw the interviews and clips, I knew it was something I needed to see. I am an emotional person to begin with and I knew this movie was going to take me on a roller coaster of emotions, but still, I felt an obligation to see it.So I made the plans. My daughter I felt was old enough to see it and my best friend wanted to go. My son was too young to go see an R rated movie and my husband would stay home with him. As we picked the day and the time to go I had mixed feelings. I didn't want cry, I knew I would. I didn't want to listen to people pick it apart afterwards. I didn't want to discuss with people if it was an accurate depiction of the Gospels, but again, I felt an obligation to go.The three of us stepped into the movie theater a half hour early to ensure that we got good seats, and that we could sit together. We cracked jokes and laughed all the while knowing that our mood was about to change drastically. My daughter came prepared with a hand full of tissues and my best friend made sure I'd be there for her when they showed Satan. She had seen a clip and it freaked her out. So we were prepared. We ate the popcorn and candy we had purchased knowing that once the movie started we wouldn't feel like eating.Then it started. There was Jesus in the Garden, and he was sweating drops of blood. He was crying out to his father, abba, as he called him. Satan was there too...I wondered if Satan had actually been in the garden, was that Biblical? I put those thoughts aside and let myself get caught up in the movie. It was a movie after all, something to be taken in and not picked apart.   The story went as I expected, the betrayal, the trial, the soldiers beating Jesus, and enjoying it. I thought to myself, ok this is bad, but I can handle it. I have heard this story all my life. I know it by heart. Yes a crucifixion was gruesome, horrible, and bloody, but I knew that coming in. Maybe I wouldn't even need those tissues.Then things began to change, Peter denied Jesus, there was so much confusion. There was no fault found in him yet he was beaten. The Pharisee's had everyone to the point of a riot, demanding he be put to death. Then he was sent to be `punished' for his crimes. The soldiers beat him with a smile on their faces. They laughed and mocked him, and when it seemed he couldn't stand any longer they brought out the whips with broken glass on the ends. They whipped him and blood was everywhere, on the whip, on Jesus, on the ground, on the soldiers. I wanted someone to stop it. I wanted Mary to scream at them. I wanted James to run out and grab the whips from their hands. I wanted them to take the Pharisee's that stood with those smug looks on their faces and start to beat them.   At first I tried to hold the tears back, then I looked at my daughter and she had her tissue out and her hand over her mouth. Tears were streaming down her face.... And I let mine come also. I wept as they beat him, I jumped every time the whip opened up the flesh on his back. I let myself feel the anger I had inside me. I wanted it to stop. But it didn't. They turned him over on his back and started whipping his chest. How could a person do such things to another human being?When they finally stopped, my tears didn't. I cried as I watched Mary wipe up his blood.  I cried as they mocked Jesus and put the crown of thorns on his head. I cried as they let Barabbas go and shouted crucify him. I cried, no I wept. I sobbed as they took him out to the streets and made him carry his cross. How could any human endure such torture?That's when it hit me.....this wasn't just a human. This was Jesus, the Messiah,.....he was my savior!!! They were beating MY savior, MY SAVIOR!!! The same savior that I asked into my heart when I was 9 years old. The same savior that had helped me and my family through countless trials, the same savior that loved me no matter what I did, no matter how I failed him. As I watched him carry his cross...as I watched him stumble.... as I watched them beat him even still, I continued to sob. I didn't realize it til then but I had grabbed Rochelle's hand and I held it til the very end.I thought how much more can he take? Of course I knew the story I knew what was still to come, I knew the ending, but none of that mattered. It didn't matter that Mel Gibson's dad said things that were a bit off, it didn't matter if the movie went detail by detail by what was in the Gospels. It didn't matter that my back hurt, it didn't matter that I paid 3 bucks for a box of candy that wasn't full, it didn't matter that there was no parking and people were mean and rude in the parking lot. It didn't matter if the people in the theatre were Christians, Jews, atheists, Catholics, young, old,....All that mattered was that there was MY Jesus, he was bleeding, he was beaten, and he was so alone. I wanted to run to him and pick him up and hold him. Without thinking I began to pray. I just started thanking God for sending Jesus, I apologized for taking his crucifixion for granted. I apologized for not seeing communion for the precious thing that is it. I prayed for the other people in the theatre, I wanted them to feel the same way I did. I wanted them to appreciate what Jesus was doing. I kept thanking him over and over again for saving me, for forgiving me....I continued to sob. My shoulders shook as Mary ran to her son as he fell, remembering him falling as a child, holding his face as she held him as a child to comfort his skinned knee. I wept openly now, not trying to hide anything, not caring if others saw or heard me. I wept when they nailed him to the cross; I gasped as each nail was driven into his hands, I cried out when they uncaringly flipped the cross over to bend the nails back, and then flipped it back over. I jumped when they dropped the cross in the ground. As he hung there on the cross, memories of the sins I had committed came to my mind. For every mark on his body, there was a sin of mine.
I saw myself as a child being mad at my parents for forcing me to go to Sunday School. I saw myself fighting with my siblings, I saw myself as a teen lying to my parents. Then I saw myself as an adult,  yelling at my kids,  arguing with my husband,   putting my Bible aside to watch tv, or go to sleep early.It was almost too overwhelming, God must have known it, for my focus then shifted. I realized that it wasn't all about me.  He was on that cross for his followers, he was on that cross for his disciples, he was on that cross for the soldiers who beat him, he was on the cross for the Pharisees, he was on the cross for the murders, the thieves..He was on the cross bearing the sins of every person who for had hurt me, for ever person who had hurt my family or my friends, and if he could die for them, if he could endure such agony and betrayal, couldn't I at least forgive them???
For every droop of blood I saw fall to the ground, there was a person he had died for, whether they accepted him or not. He was dying for people who loved him and those that didn't. He died for those who fought to keep morals and the Bible as a part of our government, and those who fought for Gay marriages. He died for `50 cent', he died for Billy Graham.   He died for serial killers, he died for my grandma.  He did this for every single person who ever lived and those not yet born.Again I was overwhelmed and I noticed I was squeezing my daughter's  hand. I reached over and put my hand on my best friend's shoulder as I noticed that she too was crying. There was Jesus, and he was on that cross because of me and I had just taken his forgiveness for granted. I knew He would always forgive me, I was taught that too.   I had heard the story many times, and I had been raised knowing that he died on the cross for me, I knew he wore a crown of thorns, I knew that the same people that had laid palm branches in from of him were the people that yelled Crucify him just days later. But at that moment in that theatre, it touched my heart in a way it never had before.I watched as they slowly and gently took Jesus down off the cross and I watched Mary hold her son. The screen went white and you could have heard a pin drop. I saw the tomb, and I saw Jesus, whole and new with the hole in his hand, walk out of the tomb. I realized that I hadn't stopped crying. People started to get up and walk out and I just sat there crying.   I sat still, trying to see if others were affected they way I was. My daughter was still crying.....As the rest of the people left I looked at her and said `I can't stop crying' She reached over to hold my hand and I wrapped my arms around her and I held her as I continued to cry.....So now what....It was an emotional night, at times my actions and emotions were even embarrassing.....was it just a movie that I shared with my daughter and best friend? Were the emotions I felt private and something that I should just hold to myself and pray others are touched as I was?I don't know what I am supposed to do with this movie, but I do know that something in me has changed. I can feel it. I still feel it today. I want to be better. I want to try harder. I want every person to realize what I realized in that movie, and I don't want this feeling to go away. Last night I hugged my son a little tighter, I told my husband I loved him with a little more feeling, and I got ready to go to work today with a little more realization that I could make a difference.No, I don't think that I will be a perfect mother, daughter, employee, or wife because of seeing the Passion; but I believe that God has straightened my path a bit and given me a clearer perspective on life and those around me. This morning I had a little more patience with my son as he took his time getting ready for school, I was a little more thankful for the paid off car I was driving, with all its imperfections and I was a bit more considerate of the person who inevitably cut me of on the way into work.I will never again be able to sing `nothing but the blood of Jesus' or take communion without seeing Mary wiping up Jesus' blood after he was beaten and tortured.  I will never again me able to live through a Good Friday without remembering Jesus on the cross saying, `Abba, forgive them, they know not what they do.'   And when someone hurts me I will remember Jesus saying, `Love your enemies'.The movie `The Passion' will be met with high marks and be criticisms I am sure.  Some will love it some will hate it. Some will want it to win an Oscar, some will want it burned. But some people will see it the way I did. They will have seen their Savior beaten, humiliated, and eventually killed, all because He loved us; and those who see it the way I did, will never again be able to take His love or His forgiveness for granted.",The Passion of the Christ
1785,big_sexy_fadel,Without a doubt an unbelievable experience into the final hours of Jesus Christ.,10,2 March 2004,"I went into this movie expecting the best, and the best is what I got. This is definetely not a movie, it is an experience. Mel Gibson brings you into the film like you are actually there witnessing the brutal torture of Christ. Gibson is a marvelous director and he has oscar written all over this film. He showed us what he could do with Braveheart and now he tops that off with The Passion of The Christ. Jim Caviezel played an excellent Jesus and Maria Morgenstern played the role of Mary with uncanning ability. This movie is extremely gruesome and violent and is sometimes very difficult to watch. The nature of this violence is to make us think we are actually there to see the suffering Jesus went through for our sins. Overall this film is a definite 10/10 and it is not be missed. Truely, the best film of all time!",The Passion of the Christ
1786,m00kiegirl,WOW!,10,2 March 2004,"I was not surprised that this movie would be amazing.  Mel Gibson has such passion; for life, for acting, for being.  I was truly moved by this movie. It was a humbling experience to sit in the theater and watch His last hours. All I can say is that it will change your outlook on life; if you weren't a believer before - you will be.  If you were a believer, it will reaffirm your faith.  Most people are visual, and I can say I'm one of them.  You don't get even a smidgeon of what He did for us by reading it in the Bible or hearing it preached from the pulpit.  Seeing this movie brings it to life - you can't mistake what He went through and what He did for each and everyone one of us.  Go see it.  You'll be glad you did.",The Passion of the Christ
1787,augpatom,"great film, some kind of impassable border to future biblical movies",10,10 March 2004,"There weren't such a film before - all previous films based on the Gospel story seem flat, false and too sweet. This one refreshes to Christians things which became conventional and unsensual even to zealous religious practitioners. But not only this refreshment of the sense of pain (in double sense of the word ""sense"") in Christ's Passion is great value of the work: this film is also great work of film art where all the means of expressions are rigorously subordinated to the Truth: metaphysical, moral and theological Truth, and also - truth of the realism of meticulously recreated ancient world. It is definitely the most credible ancient world I have ever seen in the film (even comparing it to fantastic ""Pharaoh"" by Jerzy Kawalerowicz).The use of ancient languages was the device both engaging and distancing spectator to the horrible spectacle in ancient Jerusalem - the effect is really moving. The editing is superb - alternating Passion with flashbacks where Jesus' lessons are quintessentially given - makes the horrible pain full of meaning and necessary to suffer. Also beautiful is framing and composition of shots, often methonymically showing via some details some more general meanings and contexts. In one word - this Passion should be not only viewed but also experienced by everybody; it is not simply film but great spiritual (and artistic, after all) experience.",The Passion of the Christ
1788,ericgraze,An experience of my lifetime that I will never forget.,10,2 March 2004,"I had planned on seeing this movie on a Friday after work, but I couldn't wait that long. I saw the movie on a Monday (yesterday) and let me tell you, it was pretty much exactly what I have been taught in my life through my church. It was touching. To actually ""see"" what my savior went through for me made my cry. Yes there is violence in this movie, but I feel it is needed, his actual crucifixion was not ""sugar coated"" so then why should the story of it be? Mel Gibson wanted the people to ""see"" it as he saw it, I guess as he imagined it would have been. I take my hat off to Mel Gibson for having the courage to make such a movie. You see, I was deeply moved by this movie, to hear something all your life, and then get a chance to ""see"" it as it ""actually"" happened is something truly extraordinary. If you have any part of any belief that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world/or for you, then this is the movie you need to see. All I can say is excellent, and, THANK YOU JESUS!",The Passion of the Christ
1789,ldawson-2,The viewing of The Passion of the Christ left me a changed women.,10,2 March 2004,"Mel Gibson has earned every ounce of my respect and done so before I saw The Passion of the Christ; while watching him in an interview with Dian Sawyer I realized this man had been touched by a life changing experience.  I have to admit I fought butterflies while taking the 45 minute ride to see the movie, I was prepared for the worst but it was much more than that, and he done it just me....and you.  It was hard to watch; I closed my eyes at one point thinking it would be easier-it was not. I couldn't leave the room for thinking it was disrespectful to Christ. I endured every second of every swing he took and I left that movie a changed person.  Mel was able to capture so many emotions; His mother's love and agony of being helpless, Mary's amazing love for him, the disciples love and betrayal and his father's  huge tear drop - simply was amazing.  I think during these times with all the murder, drugs, same sex marriages and the war a movie such as this HAD to be made.  Sure takes one back a knotch...or 2.  I am very proud of Mel, he has done what many preachers have been afraid of doing; TAKING A STAND.  Thank you Mel for sharing your personal experiences of Christ with us - the nation. I'm not sure if Mel will read this or if any of his friends will read it and pass it on to him, I do hope he knows what a miraculous thing he has done and I pray for his strength to continue holding his own with the media, they have been rough on him, I think partly because he has forced them to watch Christ's crucifixion.  Here's a pat on the back Mel. By the way, wonderful ending. I kept wondering how you end this movie. OUTSTANDING",The Passion of the Christ
1790,drkjm,The film was better than the book!,10,2 March 2004,"The book didn't do as much for me as the movie. The man can direct. Elements of ""Braveheart"" are present; can this be all bad?. Whether or not God exists is secondary to the awesome presentation of a known historical event. This movie will not win any Oscars, but this says more about the Academy than about the film, doesn't it?. The use of Aramaic/Latin/Hebrew dialogue was anticipated to be off-putting, but in fact the reverse applied, creating in me a feeling of being there more strongly than in any other movie. This is a work of art more than it is a theological lecture and deserves to be judged on that basis alone.",The Passion of the Christ
1791,leachville3,Life Changing,10,3 March 2004,"I cannot remember a single time when a movie has had such a profound impact on my life. I have always considered myself a moderately catholic person, going to church like all good christian people do, but like someI went but didn't always listen maybe as much as I should have. Then along came this movie, this beautiful movie. As graphic as it is we finally get the unfluffed version, I now can understand the sacrifice made for me, for everyone. That is the moral of this story, the suffering, he layed down his life for us. I left feeling helpless, sad, and weak, but most of all thankful. Now every morning when I get up I look forward to starting the day instead of dreading it because I now realize that everyday is a gift. So thank you Mr.Gibson for making a movie like this. Regardless of what other critics may say , I loved it !!!!!!",The Passion of the Christ
1792,redherring77,Necessary Gore,10,3 March 2004,"My God! Literally.  I have never considered myself an actively religious person, so I went went to this film out of curiosity, rather than to fulfill a religious need. I learned very quickly what all the fuss was about.  The suffering of Jesus has never been depicted so gruesomely, as in this film, as we all have heard.  I left wondering why Mel did it this way? I think I understand. If one is to believe the bible, Jesus died for our sins.  His blood was shed for our sins.  I think Mel wanted the viewer to realise the magnitude of these statements. In this world there must be millions upon millions of sins committed each day. If these sins were to be translated into wounds, or into drops of blood, it is only logical that Jesus would have suffered so terribly. This film left me bewildered. It made me think about loving my enemy. Emotionally draining, but utterly fantastic.",The Passion of the Christ
1793,bearsmuchfruit,Amen......,10,3 March 2004,"I am astonished with Mr. Gibson, and his passion for the Truth.  I was delighted to see this EPIC MOVIE, and I was truly moved, not just the cinematic aspect, but with the accounts with the Gosples being right on, and being in sequence.  I was moved Spirtually and emotionally, seeing this depiction of the sacrifice of our LORD and SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, and the expence to intercede for us, since the Fall of ADAM.  I don't think at all that the Film is Anti-Semitic in anyway, though the Romans (pilate) and the Jews (the Sanhedrin) where the vessels, but it was MY SIN, and your SIN, and the SINS from the Fall of ADAM, till JESUS COMES the Second time, not the Rapture, but after he recieves those whom believe after the Tribulation period.

I thank God that someone has taken the sugar coating off of the crucifixion and showed what actually happened. There is something that I noticed after the movie was finished; I couldn't even remember reading the words in the film, although I know I did. It was as if I was right there standing next to Mary, feeling the pain of seeing the son crucified, and feeling the shame inside knowing he died for my sins, therefore I was one of them that killed him. I have to say I've always been a fan of Mel Gibson, but this is by far his greatest work. Keep it up Mel, I'm already waiting for your next Bible based film. God Bless all of you that was part of the making of this film.",The Passion of the Christ

Mel Gibson and his crew gave over 100% and this movie really does deserve a standing innovation.  Mel did not create this movie for the money, he didn't abuse the bible by 'creating' a bloody scene for the audience.  How could it of been that Jesus was beaten, spit on, nailed to a cross ... with no blood? No violence? The truth may hurt ... actually, it just goes to show the true picture. Just like Jesus was not at fault- but merely spoke the truth, he was crucified.  Mel Gibson created a movie based on the truth.  And in a way, he is being crucified.  There were 2 men carrying that cross .. Jesus and man. If you love Jesus .. you will also take up your cross. Who cares what the news media says, who cares if someone disagrees with you. Who cares if we get knocked down by the world.  In the end, even they will bow at the feet of Jesus.",The Passion of the Christ

This film in my opinion as public as it is, is also very personal. I know that my heart was touched very deeply by God. I thank Mel Gibson for his courage and obedience in helping to evangelize the world, both Christians and non- Christians alike. I know that I will never be quite the same again( in a good way.)I really thought that I understood what Jesus' passion was all about, but hearing the words and seeing it are two completely different things. This movie has brought me closer to God.I also saw how powerful forgiveness is and I understand more why Jesus asks for mercy.As I continue to seek the face of God I know that I will be able to love as Jesus loves.",The Passion of the Christ

Im seeing it again tomorrow, just because i liked it that much.  ive been raised catholic all of my life, but trust me ive had my ups and downs.  for two months prior to seeing the film, i had stopped going to church and had given up on my faith.  the passion was a wake up call and brought me back to my faith.  i have never cried during a movie before, but i cried at least 4 times during the passion.  it p****s me off when the atheists in these forums completely diss God and our faith, well you know what, we dont go around telling you that your views suck so just shut up about God not existing.  If you didn't have any doubt that there was no god then you wouldnt always be trying to prove that he isnt.

It has drawn me closer to the Saviour.I hope Hollywood gets a clue.Saying that this film was anti-semetic is the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Are people that small minded and unenlightened.And to say Mel Gibson left out all these other great parts is half true.Mel perfectly blends the teachings of Jesus throughout this masterpiece.

My 17yr old said ""It was straight""  which I think is her way of saying that she also liked the movie. I would recommend this movie to Christians & Non-Christian's.

The fact is that it really happened and that may not be intellectually satisfying enough for some.  There was no hypothetical Kubricesque ""ultra-violence"" or ""horror show"" to elevate this movie to the level of ""High Art"".  There was simple brutal history in which we all share responsibility.  Clean, pure, correct.Thanks Mel.

1802,owenmckenna,Quite a wake-up call!,10,4 March 2004,"There was so much hype around this film and so much detail had been provided in clips, interviews, reviews and trailers that I doubted this movie would have anything else to offer.It sure did.When you go see it, take notice of the other characters.  The portrayals of Peter, John, Mary Magdalene, Veronica, Barrabas, Simon of Cyrene, the Roman soldier who was wounded by Peter, the one who pierced Jesus' side, the good thief, ... so many great great moments.The flashbacks work.  The languages work.  The soldiers, apostles, devil, rabble, etc, and of course the crucifixion are realistic, and the star's interpretation of the role is mighty.This was a very ""earthy"" movie.  It makes you want to go back and see it again, but this time you'll know when to flinch, and you'll look into his eyes more, and you'll ask more questions than you'd have considered when you first decided to see what all the fuss is about.",The Passion of the Christ
1803,sallyhopkins,This movie reminded me of my responsibility to my Lord.,10,4 March 2004,"The Passion of Christ is the most powerful film I have ever seen.  I am one of those people who cover their eyes during graphic scenes and say ""tell me when this part is over"".  I am not a fan of violent  or explicit movies.  I must say that the scenes of Christ being beaten were so compelling that I never took my eyes off the screen. As I watched and cried, it became so clear to me how much He suffered for my sins and what a gift He has given to me. It was my responsibility to watch Him endure the pain, so that I fully understood the sacrifice. I needed to see the true nature of  the beating and crucifixion, not the sanitized version I had grown up with. Understanding the depth of the sacrifice makes me aware that I need to live my life as Christ has taught me through the Gospels. The day after seeing The Passion of Christ, I was still unsettled as I processed what I had seen and what was expected of me by my Lord. As Satan lurked offering easy solutions to pain and suffering, I realized that I must be on the alert at all times so I do not succumb the temptation of Satan with easy solutions to the burdens in my life. I can find the strength I need in my Lord just as Christ found his strength and reject the temptations of Satan. Thank you Mel Gibson for your decision to make this film.

1806,servantochrist,Best interpretation of this subject I have ever seen.,10,4 March 2004,"I realize that few people have the background in biblical studies that I have--about ten years of study in the original languages, Greek and Hebrew (Aramaic).  During those years of language study, I also studies the historical context of the languages.  I would love to know what was done to research the historical setting for the movie.  My guess is that from the atire to the attitudes depicted, Gibson, et. al., were 90-95% correct.
I have watched every Bible based movie of note that has every been made. Without exception, moving the biblical text to the silver screen is a challenge for anyone.  It presents an almost unique challenge to be true to the original texts.  Two movies based on the Bible standout as being well done and true to the text and context--The Passion and the Prince of Egypt. I know they are very different presentations of the Bible, but the screenplay was excellent.I urge you to watch The Passion in its context, the New Testament--read one or more of the Gospels if necessary.  You cannot appreciate what you are seeing unless you have a knowledge of at least one of the Gospels.  If you have seen the movie, but have not read the context, do so and then watch the movie one more time.  I believe it will change the way you perceive The Passion.

Who'd thought God would use Mel Gibson to direct and produce the most accurate and more importantly ""anointed"" films of all time.  Knowing how Hollywood likes to jump on the bandwagon when they see a genre of movies as successful, I'd like to give them a word of advice.  Unless your ""Christian"" movie is anointed and ordained of God, don't expect to experience the success Mel has experienced with his ""The Passion of the Christ.""  Mel's movie has God's stamp of approval!  My friends and I haven't been so anxious to see a movie in a long time.

As the Word says, we haven't suffered to the point of death, as He (Jesus) did.  Thank you Mel for being obedient to the Holy Spirit by making this movie.  I'm certain that it was a struggle for you considering the impact to your career.  But as you can see by your choice to be obedient, God has multiplied to you over 100-fold.

I applaud him for his courage and thank him for this film that is life changing and deeply moving. It's one thing to read about this but something else to watch.

I am a deep seeded Christian, and this film touched my heart so vibrantly, that I was in tears through most of it. It is a true and factual account and I didn't witness any sway from what the Bible tells.  When available, I will be purchasing the movie.

1812,blynn179,Passion is more than a movie,10,4 March 2004,"Mel Gibson has created the greatest movie of all time. Never has a movie pulled me in from the opening scene to the close.  In fact this was not like going to a movie, it is an experience. I believe anyone who knows Jesus owes it to themselves to see this movie. I came out of this movie loving my Lord more than ever. It is one thing to read and know what he did for us, but to be able to visualize just a glimpse of what he endured for us is another thing all together.  James Caveziel was perfect for the part. I did not see an actor playing the part. It is as if you are transported back to the time and are witness to it all first hand.  I also do not see anything anti-semitic about this movie. This movie makes me realize that I need to love everyone - no exceptions.  Thank you to Mel Gibson for having the courage to bring this movie to life and to all the cast also.",The Passion of the Christ
1813,jumpin4jesus,INCREDIBLY done!,10,7 March 2004,"The Passion was an incredible movie, and the way it was done made me feel as though I were there, watching it all happen. Although there is a lot of blood in the movie, the brutality in the film is reality- Christ suffered as badly as shown in the movie. The movie truly did strengthen my faith....If He did that for each and every one of us, how much are we willing to suffer for Him? As I watched the film, I was tempted many times to look down, but I didn't... for Him. Everyone should see this movie...Christians should watch it to see what their Lord went through so He could spend eternity with us. Non-Christians should see it as an eye-opener. Many complain that if you don't already know Christ, you will be confused... that is what the Bible is for! To Search!I would be hesitant to let a child (under 13) watch this film more-so because of the demonic parts in the film, than the brutality. Many Christians today have a very shallow idea of what Christ did and the movie portrays that well, but the demonic scenes could really scare a child and give them nightmares. I think that Mel did an awesome job with Satan's role in the film. The Evil One is always in our midsts (""for we do not war against flesh and blood...""), and he was surely in the crowd of people wanting Christ to be crucified. What Satan wanted for evil, God made for good.The flashbacks in the movie are excellent, really filling in in areas where people might have questions, and also might need a ""break"" from the brutality going on in the film. Also in many of the flashbacks, it is of Christ telling what is to come, while the movie is at the time, portraying what Christ said would happen. Excellent thought!There are scenes in the movie that the Bible does not talk about. There is only one scene in it that is actually different than what the Gospels tell us. The other scenes that are questionable are ""fill-ins"" that are completely understandable as the Gospels do not tell what is going on the background, but really only give a summary of Christ's suffering and death.
This is NOT another ""gore movie"" and IS of Love. This movie shows us just how much love Christ had for us, and what He was willing to do for everyone of us. There were other ways He could have done it, but instead went an extremely painful way to pay that debt that we owed. The blood and violence is historically correct. I recommend that you go and see this movie- I pray it will be life-changing for you!",The Passion of the Christ
1814,pspires63,Incredible movie,10,5 March 2004,"""The Passion of the Christ"" is the most accurate rendition of the Gospels that I've ever seen. Any film that seeks to portray the Gospels with accuracy would have to be very violent. I actually prepared for even more graphic gore than was actually in the film, since I have read and heard stories of the state of victims enduring a scourging. There were only two things I wish would have been included in the film that were not. One was the ""renting of the veil"" in the temple. This is a very symbolic event in the Gospel renditions. Upon the death of Jesus, the veil separating the people from the ""Holy of Holies"" place in the temple is ripped in half, symbolizing the removal of any barriers between God and his people. The event marked the end of the need for a high priest to be the intermediary between God and man. The other thing I missed seeing is the confession of one of the Roman centurions that he believed Jesus was the Son of God. Although, by the look on some of their faces during the earthquake you could tell some of them came to some sort of realization, the confession was not heard. All in all, this was an incredibly powerful movie. I've heard charges that it was ""anti-Semitic"". There is no doubt in my mind it was ""anti-Semitic"" - you can't get more ""anti-Semitic"" than to crucify a Jew. It is as it was.",The Passion of the Christ
1815,jmoskall,you will never so much passion for one person as you do for Jesus once you see this movie,10,5 March 2004,"This movie is a wake-up call to thousands and thousands of people throughout the world.  Everybody needs to see this movie.  It really makes you understand what one person went through for you to be alive today.  If you or I were to be beat the way that Jesus did, we probably would of been dead after the second or third time you were hit. But because God knew what was going to happen to him already, Jesus suffered so that we could be alive today.  He suffered for our sins.  Never have I been so moved, so touched and so revived with watching a movie.  Watching this movie really makes me take a second look at my life and see how I can be a better person.  It makes me want to be a better person and a more pleasing person to Jesus so that I now where I will be going once I leave this world.  I want to go to heaven and not die and go to hell.  I have always been raised in a Roman Catholic/Christian upbringing and have seen movies like this before Easter on T.V.

As a ( at least trying to be a Christian ) person, I thought that it followed the bible!!! The feelings of the Christ that Gibson showed through the portrayal of such, were as I would assume they would. It made me more aware of the torture that my Lord went through and I needed that reminder!!! Mel Gibson has made a statement!!! That statement may not be agreed upon by every person ( which is OK because we are in the land of the free. )Gibson has done superbly!! The actor who portrays The Christ did an excellent job!! He is how you would picture the true Christ to look, in my opinion!I can not sing enough praises!!!Angie",The Passion of the Christ
1817,lcm24,"Very little acting, mind-numbing amounts of blood, and entirely lacks the interesting Jesus stories.",3,15 March 2004,"This movie draws out about a half an hour of ""real time"" into two hours of slow-motion violence.  There is almost no acting and no story, with loud, overly-dramatic music's making up nearly the entire soundtrack.  Somehow it manages to not include any of the interesting biblical stories about Jesus. I was stunned.  About halfway through the beatings became so repetitive that the intolerable level of violence and blood-letting became mind-numbing and forgettable.  Furthermore, many of the characters were pretty ambiguous, since they never speak, are never named, and though I suppose it is supposed to be obvious who they are, my deeply-religious, Christian in-laws could not even tell who many people were supposed to be.I am not religious myself, but I still had high hopes for the film.  A giant deal has been made out of it, and the stories have huge potential to make a wonderful film.  This one completely misses the boat.",The Passion of the Christ

But i did give into the temptation and after watching the movie, i felt horrible and felt ashamed and came this feeling of guilt. This movie does not evoke the love , spiritual lift as it claims to nor does one get the sense of passion that Christ had for all of his people. If passion and forgiveness does not stems from how much blood he shed or how brutally he was tortured. This movie tries to evoke reaction from its audience more than anything. There is no passion in this movie and is no way depicted by the fetishistic torture scences. The movie is about ""flesh not passion"". I was truly disappointed by this movie and I felt ashamed of myself as i am now one of millions of people who just made mel gibson's fat wallet even fatter.",The Passion of the Christ

This film brought the reality of the suffering and true love of God for all sinners. Many people might feel that it's too graphic but for me it just put into perspective why I try to live everyday in His likeness. I don't want Jesus' suffering to be in vain, when it comes to my life. I feel closer to Him and daily reflect on what He endured. All because He loved us and wanted to give us a way to obtain eternity with Him. I feel blessed to know Him and have been inspired by this film to know Him more. Thank you to everyone who had a part in creating and bringing this film to us. May you be Blessed.",The Passion of the Christ
1820,momfultime,A very humbling experience,10,5 March 2004,"Wow.  This is not a movie in the simple meaning of the word.  This is an experience, a very humbling one.  I'm in awe of the actors, down to every facial expression.  They were perfectly cast.  I felt as though I was actually THERE, not in a theater, but there 2000 years ago when this happened.  It was definitely hard to watch as a believer and follower of Christ.  Several times I was moved to tears.  I shifted from the edge of my seat, to the very back of my seat with my hands covering my face.  I made myself watch every moving and painful moment.  It touched me like no other movie ever has or ever will.  It strengthened my walk with the Lord.  None of us deserve what Jesus Christ did for us, but he did die for every human being ever born.  He died to give us the choice.  You make that choice to accept his gift of eternal life or not.",The Passion of the Christ
1821,serpent0001,'The Passion..' Thought Provoking,10,5 March 2004,"I saw the film the first day of its release.  While it is undeniably violent and at times excruciating to watch, I feel it's also inherently powerful. Unlike other films, (I'm almost reticent to actually call this a film - it's more like a series of moving living medieval stills of a passion play)This film somehow seeps into one's consciousness and takes root and has one of 2 effects: 1) for the believer - it seems to be a faith-affirming experience. ""This is the extent that Jesus loved me...he went to his very death to prove It."" is the question that lingers in the mind.  OR 2) for the secularist or non-believer one is left with a series of disturbing violence and open-ended questions seemingly with no concrete answers. Is this movie the be-all-end all of Jesus and the Gospels?  No, of course not, it's an artist's conception of these texts and his own belief in them. At the very least, 'The Passion of the Christ' seems to have put the values of faith, self-sacrifice, and man's inhumanity to one another at the forefront of everyone's thoughts.",The Passion of the Christ
1822,kewlmomofsix,Everyone must see this Film!,10,5 March 2004,"This is an awesome, movie.  Not only are the actors awesome, but the word Passion seems to sum this up perfectly.  The woman who played Jesus' mother deserves an Oscar.  Even though the film is in subtitles, the movie is so well written and the actors are so wonderful that it's not like the average movie and it doesn't take away from the film.  Like some films that are awful because you spend more time reading than watching, this is not like that at all.  Go see it, it's a must that can't even be described.All the controversy over this movie is a mess.  This movie is a portrait of part of what Christ volunteered to endure for our salvation.  And if people could get over themselves long enough to stop making this movie about who did what to whom, they could see the real reason for the film.  The movie isn't about the Jews or the Romans, it's about the ultimate sacrifice for our sins.  And Mel Gibson did an outstanding job of portraying this sacrifice.  I had no idea he was so talented.  He has captured the scripture and if there is any doubt than I encourage everyone to read the Bible and find out if this movie is accurate or not.  Jesus Christ is truly Lord of all.  Everyone should go and see this movie.  Go and watch and think about the reason WHY he died.  Remember that He decided to die, just to save you and me!

1823,obrooks-1,Outstanding Movie,10,5 March 2004,This is the most powerful movie I have ever saw. It may not have been completely accurate but no one knows exactly what happened to Christ during this time. The Bible leaves a lot of blank spaces. I was completely awed by this movie. It left an impression on me that I will not soon forget. I was speechless after the movie and so were my family and others in the theater. This movie should stir hearts like no other movie ever has. I can't understand people that could watch it and not be moved by it. Mel Gibson did a remarkable job with the presentation. He should receive every acclaim that Hollywood gives for this movie but I doubt that he will. This movie could be God's last effort to stir this country back to him,The Passion of the Christ
1824,jrwla,It was like being on the front row of history for the last 12 hours of Jesus' life,10,5 March 2004,"This movie was gripping to the core.  Mel Gibson focused on the last twelve hours of Jesus' life, and it that time allowed the viewer to understand Jesus' life and death much better.Though he started at the garden and ended at the empty tomb, the film focused on the suffering that Jesus went through in-between.  Mel made important flashbacks to Jesus' life and teaching that helped us understand why Jesus ended his life on a cross.Jesus is protrayed as a human being who understood the calling that his Father gave him.  It is accurate to the ancient text and helps bring to life the passion that Jesus has for all of humanity, including His people - the Jews.Understanding his passion and willingness to face death for us, stirs a passion in me to want to live more fully, like He did.",The Passion of the Christ

It moved me to get back in church and to realize that the little problems I have don't even deserve to be mentioned. I felt the whole time that I deserved what He went through for me. He didn't deserve it. The movie held my attention. It was the closest thing that I have ever seen that depicted the truth as the Bible relates it to us. I feel that if He went through that for us, the least we can do is watch it so that we can understand what He did for us. I'm more in love with Jesus then ever before. I have a new appreciation for what He did for us. I really want to thank Mel Gibson for risking his whole career to tell the truth. God will reward Him for it in more ways then he will ever imagine.

My children who have been somewhat wishy washy about their religion were given a wonderful gift of seeing what Christ did for them.

Many people crying in the audience. Could awaken a new spiritualistic phase of American life for Christians and others moved by the story.  As for anti-Semitic characterizations--I saw Jews portrayed as ""good guys"" and Jews portrayed as ""bad guys.""  The focus of the film is so far away from that simplicity that unless you come in with a predisposition to look for it you'll never notice it.  In a world where we like our spirituality politically correct--preferably with a stamp of approval from Oprah--and not too disturbing--this film reminds us of the razors 's edge that is the way to enlightenment or salvation in most religions.",The Passion of the Christ
1829,dcassar,"A Powerful Film for Christians, by Christians",8,5 March 2004,"Mel Gibson is a purist in every sense of the word, and his Passion is irrefutable proof.  Told in its original tongue (mainly Aramaic and Latin with English subtitles), the story is almost wholly unembellished, and he makes no attempt to pander to the audience.  He goes in with the assumption that the viewer knows the story.  He explains almost nothing, allowing the Word to speak for itself.For those who may not be familiar with the term, the Passion of Christ refers specifically to the suffering and crucifixion, and the movie is only that, opening in the Garden at Gethsemane and closing at Mount Calvary. If this tells you little, then you are probably not the intended audience. From an outsider's point of view, the movie has scarcely any plot, almost no development, and precious little to room to catch one's breath.To the Christian, however, it is a powerful portrayal of the Savior's suffering.  What you've heard about the graphic nature of the film is true: it's a brutal tale and this rendering is certainly the most graphic and intense version you are likely to have seen.  The movie isn't for children. It's a confession, it's an act of faith.  If you go into it with that in mind, you will not be disappointed.",The Passion of the Christ
1830,ricksharp7,An excellent movie. You will either love it or hate it.,9,6 March 2004,"I saw this movie opening weekend, and have had a week to reflect on it. There are certain scenes that I still can't get out of my mind a week later. It is haunting, and I will see it again.The first thought I had when leaving the movie was how utterly rediculous the claims of anti-semitism are. If anything, when I left, I was really mad at the Romans. But it was easy to distinguish the Romans of that time (which are on record for their brutality) from the Italians of today. But you would really have to skew the film to get any anti-semitism out of it.Technically, the movie is excellent. Lighting, sound, and cinematography were all done very well. There were a couple of FX that were not necessary and didn't add to the movie, but they really didn't detract either.If you are a Christian, or open to the message of Christianity, you will most likely love this movie. It is definitely geared to those of the Christian faith. It assumes you come in with some knowledge of the Gospels and can fill in some blanks. If you are protestant, you will notice some pointedly Catholic scenes. I, as a Protestant, was not put off by them at all, but instead found them to beautifully fill in the story. Also, I would say that about 85% of the movie was straight from scripture. The rest was used to either fill in the story, or to give us some deeper insight into the characters. I didn't find anything that was added that was in opposition to the scriptures as a whole. Let's face it, the Bible was written as a theological/historical document, and does not translate well to film without a little modification.In summary, the movie was excellent and well worth the ticket price. One word of caution, though. Don't waste the money on popcorn. About a half an hour in, you will totally lose you appetite.",The Passion of the Christ

It will bring faith in the knowledge...""He went through this all for me!"" Knowing this...""Can you truely still not have faith in him and our Heavenly Father?"" I dream of the day when his Reign in heaven will come in to effect. When we shall all be at piece. No more war. No more murders. No more pain and heart ache.

I believe in some ways that this is good so that people can really understand the pain of Jesus. I myself am not one who necessarily enjoys war movies because of the gore, but this movie doesn't play out as a battle. I recommend this movie to people who really think they can handle it but know it doesn't hold anything back visually. My thanks to Mel Gibson",The Passion of the Christ
1833,amoseman,Just a bad movie,1,6 March 2004,"I expected to leave the movie feeling compelled, but instead I was thoroughly disgusted from the opening nose maggot to the closing blood shower on the cross.The bottom line is this is a movie that is driven by a particular Catholic theology and was meant to hammer home the passion narrative with as much blood and guts as possible.  In the end, I think it failed, as I left the movie entirely put-off.Many reviewers have made the claim that this movie makes clear messages such as ""Jesus died for all of us,"" or that all of us were at fault for his death.  I think you can only take this away from the movie if it's what you brought to the movie.  If someone had little or no knowledge of the theology at work during the movie, they would both have missed these ""messages,"" and would largely have been confused as to what is from the Gospels, what is from later Church theology, and what is part of Gibson's [the word ""artistic"" removed] vision.Additionally, I don't see how individuals can claim the movie doesn't pin Jesus's death squarely on the Jews.  Pilate's wife's instant acceptance of Jesus makes this abundantly clear.I attended the movie with my girlfriend, who has no background in theology and when she walked out of the movie, the first thing she said was, ""That was the worst movie I've ever seen.""  I think this opinion speaks volumes.",The Passion of the Christ

I have read and heard some complain that the violence was more than was needed to adequately portray the suffering that Jesus went through that day, but, to be honest, I have seen worse in everyday TV movies and cartoons that are on during the day and the evening family hours.  I would not want a young child to watch this movie, as the suffering that he went through would be just too much for them to understand, but, any bible literate child could understand. If they are old enough to watch TV and understand what they are watching, or old enough to go to video store and rent one of the so popular ""slasher"" movies, they are old enough to see and understand ""The Passion of The Christ.""  I went straight to a local bookstore and read again the new testament account of His suffering and death in those hours, coming away from this movie with a feeling of truth, understanding and a much deeper faith in God.  There should be many, many more made in the same way, depicting the bible stories in the true way which Mr. Gibson developed and portrayed the life and death of Jesus Christ.",The Passion of the Christ

I avoid violent and gory movies and I watched this one because of the subject matter.  It was not over the top and I did not get sick.  With movies like Kill Bill not getting a peep of objection (yuck)about violence, what is up?  While watching I was tense because it was an intense subject and when it ended I was solemn and introspective, like the majority of the other viewers in the theater.

I can truly say that the film changed my life influenced me a great deal and as a result I attended church for the first time in my entire life, and I have to admit, I really enjoyed it.My parents are Buddhists, however, I was never really a religious person. really I guess I haven't really found my niche until now.

It has touched me like no other experience of my life. I was physically and mentally shaken by what I saw. I came out feeling like the guard at the foot of the cross with the blood spewing out all over him.

I consider this to be one of the best, if not the best, movie I have ever seen. The cast did a wonderful job and all worthy of Oscar nominations. Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus was amazing in that he was able to show the human side in his pain and fright but also the Divine side in the way he had Jesus constantly forgiving all the people who were harming him. Their capabilities to show the emotions of their characters (pain, anger, grief, sorrow, shame) are all amazing. Mel Gibson's goal when he made this movie was to make a movie that moved people. I can assure that Mr. Gibson not only succeeded in moving me, He moved ever other person who saw the movie and he will move every person who will see it.

Yes it's violent and I wouldn't suggest it for young children but I would suggest all adults and young adults to see this film. I don't really understand why the violence was such a big deal considering that people had no problem with ""Friday the 13th"" and other horror movies, this violence serves a purpose. It's a life changing movie if you open your heart to it. I always had a hard time picturing what He really went through. It also shows scenes of how He touched peoples lives before He was crucified.

I know that this movie is a great move of God on the entire world. As if God himself is saying to the people of today ""get ready because I am coming back"". It is a refreshing thought and experience being called out by God himself.  Knowing that this world and all its many sins is not the end of our existence is extremely POWERFUL. We have not even begun to experience what life is really about. How reassuring it is to know that there is a God that loves the human race. He has sacrificed much so that we may have the opportunity to live happy and enjoyable lives. This movie has helped me to experience more of what God has given us through Jesus Christ. I will not take for granted the great sacrifice God made by giving his life on the cross. His passion is to save as many souls as possible, so that we may be in his presence forever. Jesus Christ is a Jew and the Jews are God's chosen people. No one including Christians have any right to be anti-Semitic towards Jews. Jesus Christ gave his commandment that fulfilled all commandments `love one for another'. If we are true Christians; therefore, we will keep the commandment of love that God has given through Jesus Christ. I saw no anti-Semitism portrayed in this movie. What was portrayed was the great sacrifice and love God has for all of man-kind.",The Passion of the Christ
1843,raymondcrooms1,The Movie was POWERFUL,1,6 March 2004,"I am not sure what I was expecting as I went to see this movie, it met and exceeded any and all expectations that I had.  This movie was derived directly from the Holy Bible(King James Version).  I was in tears from the start.  Anyone who has read the Bible will agree that this comes directly from the Bible.It was so real;  you were there in the midst of it all.  From the rustling of leaves to sounds of Christ being scoured (whipped), you could feel the pain and sorrow they were felling.  It makes you appreciate all Jesus went through to for our sins.I do hope that Mr. Gibson will consider another movie that starts where this one left off.",The Passion of the Christ
1844,jdkinz,The most difficult movie I've ever seen,10,24 March 2004,"The Passion of The Christ was the most amazing movie I have ever seen. The movie theater was silent except for the sounds of sobbing. The movie itself was beautifully made and painful to see. The Passion isn't clean and bloodless as are other films about the crucifixion. It gives a very graphic picture of Roman justice during the time of Christ. I spent an exhausting two hours watching my Lord go through unimaginable agony. His love, even for those who were the most brutal to Him was obvious. Even more obvious and more humbling to me was that He was no victim. At any time during the process, He could have opted out, but as it says in the scriptures, ""Greater love has no man than this, that he would lay his life down for his friends."" Jesus is so amazing that he even did it for his enemies. I left shaking & speechless; so unworthy of His sacrifice.",The Passion of the Christ
1845,shadowmaster_36,brilliant,10,6 March 2004,"This film was brilliant. Jesus gave the ultimate sacrifice, his perfect body and love for all of us wretched sinners.  Mel Gibson held nothing back when demonstrating Jesus' sacrifice.  I will never forget how Jesus could only pray for those who were killing and beating and tauting him.  Jesus stands so calmly while he is being led to his death.  He even heals a man who was trying to lead him to his death. The true Passion of the Christ is demonstrated here.  This film accomplishes what it was meant to, is shows that God loves us so much. He loved us enough to give his blood for us, all of his blood. And in a single, awe-inspiring movie we see the true Passion of the Christ.",The Passion of the Christ
1846,judycavender,Mel Gibson has out done himself. James Caviezel portrays Christ beautifully.,10,7 March 2004,"This movie was deeply poignant and profound.  Do your soul a favor and see this movie on the big screen.  Beautifully orchestrated, well acted and none ""to Hollywood,""  The Passion should take the world by storm. Congratulations Mr. Gibson for taking a stand against the liberal mutes of Hollywood who were afraid to support this movie for fear of a backlash from the public. This movie is for every one, protestant, catholic, jewish, atheist, agnostic, conservative, liberal. Where ever you are in your life this movie will give you new meaning, a reason to believe, and hope for the future.  Uplifting and eye opening, if you do not feel Christ's pain and suffering, then you do not have a heart. Go see ""The Passion.""",The Passion of the Christ
1847,tmd1977,A Masterpiece,10,7 March 2004,"Mel Gibson has given us a masterpiece.Yes, the film shows brutality and violence, but it does so with a purpose; to illustrate the suffering that Jesus bore in His role as Redeemer.
Presenting this film in Aramaic and Latin was brilliant, as it forces the viewer to focus entirely on the visuals rather than the dialogue.  Also, the eye contact and facial expressions of the actors demand greater audience concentration.The actress who plays Mary and the actor who plays St. John give tremendous performances, almost entirely with facial expressions and eye contact with Jesus.  On my second viewing of the film I noted how Mary conveys during the film -- almost entirely with facial expressions -- that she knows almost exactly what is about to happen to Jesus, while John conveys his incredulousness and confusion, also entirley with facial expressions.
The film is not for the weak-hearted.  For one knowledgeable of the New Testament, the film is quite rich and deep.  Non-believers may well miss a great deal of the subtle messages and cues in the film.On the whole, a tremendous production, worth seeing over and over.",The Passion of the Christ
1848,b_ettybop,"Life changing, heart felt, deeply moving picture",10,7 March 2004,"I would like to say ""thank you"" to Mr. Gibson for making a movie that really makes Christs death on the cross such a reality.  I felt like I was standing in the crowd watching Jesus carrying his cross up that hill.  I cried the whole time, I was so moved.  At the end of the movie when the lights came on it was absolute silence from the patrons as everyone quietly filed out of the theater.  This film really is life changing.  I will never look at the cross the same again!  I can't express what an impact this had on me. This is a great film for people of all ages (teens on up), for Christians and non-Christians.  This film will have some kind of positive influence in your life.",The Passion of the Christ
1849,Dj53ds,an extraordinay portrayal,10,8 March 2004,"I wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie--all the hype about it sort of discouraged me. My Mom really wanted to see it, so she and I and my nephew and his girlfriend went to a Sunday matinee. I have been a Christian (Lutheran) all my life (I'm 50) and I have never been so taken aback by a story about Jesus. The brutality was hard to take, but I feel the Gospels do not tell us the level of punishment Jesus took before he was crucified. The movie really left me shaken. I especially thought the ""little touches"" were very special--the dove flying overhead, the ""teardrop"" falling from heaven that initiated the earthquake, and even Jesus' pupil of his eye dialating when he died. Stuff like that always gets overlooked, and Mel Gibson got all of it--and I feel, got it right. I highly recommend this film--if you aren't a believer when you go in, you will be when you leave. (also ""Satan"" was portrayed in a believable way--prowling like a roaring lion, waiting to capture its prey)",The Passion of the Christ
1850,zancafam,It is as It Was,10,16 March 2004,"Scripted principally from the Bible, the Passion portrays the brutality and cruelty of a world not ready for forgiveness. The audience is thrust into the ancient world to witness the very real and humiliating torture and crucifixion of Christ Jesus.The Passion gives modern man an insight of a time long passed and of an individual who gave his life for his people. The relentless torture of Jesus is painful to watch but not near as painful as to have been endured. This film is the Word brought to sight, in a time where words are less understood than images. The Satan is aptly not what he seems representing the ever present evil within man even where there is great goodness.There is no suggestion of anti-semitism here. The barbarity of the story reflects the barbarity of the time not of the races. Of course politics played its role then just as it does now, to cloud the truth from the masses and have threats cast aside, lest they unsettle the status quo.All Christians will be moved by this film. Non believers will be critical of the ""violence"" being without the guns we are used to seeing.But for a poor choice of light relief (ad lib) by the Director in the making of a table, this film reaches great depth and evokes gut wrenching emotion. Unlike its many predecessors, the good work and teaching of Jesus is not in focus, only the final hours of pain, suffering and torment of a man, his mother and his followers.Whether accurately qouted or not, ""It is as It Was"" quite plainly states the the realism of this portrayal of the Passion of the Christ.",The Passion of the Christ
1851,ddavis100-1,incredible experience,10,7 March 2004,"I saw the movie at a packed theatre.  The experience was unlike any I have had at a movie.  The movie is lavishly filmed and brutally depicts the last 12 hours of Christ's life.  You could hear the sobs in the theatre as the movie progresses.Gibson does an outstanding job of having us feel the pain and hope that the message contains.  He died for our sins.  This movie is not anti-semantic. It merely shows man's inhumanity to man.Unlike other movies where everyone hurries out of the theatre to race home, everyone had the same look on their face.  No one was ready to leave the theatre.  The experience of this movie is that strong.  The images presented stay with you.The language and subtitles help keep you focused on the story.  You can't look away.  What an experience!!!!!!",The Passion of the Christ
1852,dread55,Haunting and Powerful,10,7 March 2004,"Our local newspaper movie critic's review of The Passion of the Christ included the comment ""if you are not moved by this movie, you are not human."" And I have to agree. I carried 8 tissues in with me and ran out very quickly. This movie is powerful. I could hardly breathe when it was over, much less talk. My husband, who does not show emotion easily, admitted that this movie was ""emotionally draining"". Incredibly done. Totally unforgettable. Haunting, emotionally painful, yet liberating because it really happened.The strong presence and influence of the Jewish leaders in Jesus' death may indeed lead some folks to feel this movie is anti-Semitic. (Read the Bible--it doesn't pull any punches about the Sanhedrin, the scribes or the Pharisees either.) But at the end of the movie, you truly feel more personal responsibility for Christ's crucifixion. Blaming any one or any one group of people is nonsense.",The Passion of the Christ
1853,kwilson827,The movie that helped change my life,10,7 March 2004,"This movie had to be the most intense, but best movie I've ever seen!  I felt so many emotions afterward, I couldn't even explain what I was feeling. After thinking so much about it and expressing my feelings to others, I realized that I have finally accepted Jesus Christ.  I have searched for so long, trying to feel him inside, and struggled.  I attended church for many years, studied the bible and prayed, but just didn't feel him inside of me like I have since this movie.  I am now reading a book to help me understand and keep his spirit with me.  I encourage anyone with questions and confusion about Christ to see this movie and realize how much he truly sacrificed for us.  I thank the Lord for working through Mel Gibson, who changed so many lives everywhere!   God Bless!",The Passion of the Christ

I applaud Mel Gibson for having the courage to make this film.  This film was hard to watch, but the fact that it was based on actual facts from the Bible is what makes it great.  Mel Gibson is a true Christian, and I love the fact that he didn't sugar coat the reality of what happened to Jesus, just to keep people comfortable. Because the reality of what happened to Jesus sure wasn't comfortable. There were times during the film that my husband, daughter and myself sobbed in anguish for Jesus and wanted to cry out STOP!  He's had enough.  I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to see the movie again, but have no regrets about seeing it.  Also, I feel this puts ones faith in true perspective.  I know it did mine.  Again, thanks Mel for a great film.",The Passion of the Christ

As many of us I thought He took a little beating and the we all have seen pictures of Jesus on the cross with a few drops of blood dripping from his head. But he bore so much pain that I can't help but love him more now that I know how great the sacrifice was, not only for him but for God his Father and for Mary his Mother. I have heard people talk about the blood,gore and brutality of this movie but what I saw was the love Jesus had for all of mankind.All I can say is THANK YOU MEL GIBSON!!!Now you know there are Christian people out there that will support well down Christian movies.PRAISE BE TO JESUS OUR SOON COMING KING.",The Passion of the Christ
1856,vikotas,This movie is a gift.,10,8 March 2004,"This was an accurate adaption. I thought that the subtitles were going to be distracting, but to my surprise they weren't.  I actually enjoyed hearing the original languages. All of the additional dialogue reflected the original intent. Although this movie was difficult to watch, I don't think that any moments were wasted.  The flashbacks provided more than just a reprieve from the suffering.  They revealed a man, not a pious wimp...as so many other films have.  I especially enjoyed the scene between Jesus and Mary when she wants Him to wash His hands. As a theatrical piece, it was wonderfully crafted and well paced.  The special affects were used sparingly, thank goodness. I will eventually purchase this movie",The Passion of the Christ

It's also Gibson's vision of the so-called ""Passion,"" and is no more an actual recounting of the biblical story than any other Jesus flick that's ever been made. Unlike the D-Day scenes in Saving Private Ryan, nobody alive (now matter how much they want to believe it) can say about the scourging scenes in The Passion, ""that's exactly how it was."" More accurately, it's how Mel wants you to think it was, if it ever happened at all.Yes, this is a technically well-made movie (dude DOES have a Best Director Oscar). But all Gibson is doing with this flick is  manipulating the guilt and other emotions of the audience, nothing more.The best thing to result from this movie is that hard core religious types who praise this film as the ""best ever"" can NEVER EVER EVER again denounce and decry the ""violence"" of Hollywood films without appearing hypocritical. Thanks Mel!",The Passion of the Christ
1858,clorox94,Remember What the Passion of the Christ is Meant to Portray,10,8 March 2004,"The Passion of the Christ receives 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to achieve.  What is that?  Well, if you are a Christian you believe that Christ suffered and died because of your sins.  This movie wanted to show what is meant by the term ""suffered"" when one reads about Jesus' plight in the Bible.  This movie showed how Christ suffered through one man's eyes. And, if you are a Christian you know that Christ's quandary on this earth was no cakewalk!  Not for one moment did I think, ""How could the Jews do this,"" or ""How could the Romans do this?""  NO! NO! NO!  What I was thinking is that if Christ suffered only a third of what was shown in this film (let alone if it was worse), then that is sufficient for me to love Him and be a better Christian/person.  This movie inspires Christians to cast aside vain sins they battle with knowing one Man could have suffered this much for them.  It does not matter who did the crucifying.  The fact remains that man can be both sinful and cruel. That means any man of any race, religion, etc. This movie was made to illustrate to the audience what Jesus endured because of man's sinful nature.  Being beaten and crucified is not a magnificent process, it is violent and cruel.  So mission accomplished Mel Gibson!",The Passion of the Christ
1859,JustJoanna,Painfully Beautiful,10,8 March 2004,"I cried during almost the entire film.  Afterwards I was emotionally spent. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Christ's Passion grasped my heart and soul.  I am Catholic and this is my faith.  However this film made me know my faith on a more divine level.  I am a different person now.  I have found peace where I thought it did not exist.For me personally, this film is the greatest of all time. God bless you Mel Gibson for doing what you believed in and not backing down. That takes such courage in Hollywood.Yes this movie was graphic. But I imagined what Christ endured was more than horrifically graphic.  As my 12 year old son said to me, ""We are seeing the truth. You cannot sugar coat the truth.""",The Passion of the Christ
1860,mal1sadawn,A well executed film with an awe inspiring story.,10,8 March 2004,"This is a phenomenal film.  I truly believe that if this were not the story of Christ's awe inspiring sacrifice for us all (that means all races, religions and peoples)  we would all be raving over this film.  It has everything; believable acting, insightful direction, realistic effects, effective editing and above all an awe inspiring story.  I did not notice any blaring discrepancies from the Bible's New Testament depiction of the event leading up to and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ as well as the flash backs of noted incidences in his life.  However, I am in the midst of re-reading the crucifixion and the Gospels of the New Testament.  I whole heartedly recommend this film.  There is graphic violence, but in my opinion no worse than that of most video games.  Don't let the fact that the film is subtitled put you off either.  There are not enough subtitles for even a slow reader to get lost or loose the effects of the on-screen dramatics.
Don't take my word for it, or for that matter anyone else's, form your own opinion by seeing it yourself.",The Passion of the Christ

I have seen quite a few films on the Bible, both New Testament and Old Testament, and this film blows them all away.  Look at the faces of those coming out of the movie and you will find solemn introspection, not shock from horror. The only reason the opening day sales were as small as they were, is because the film did not open on more screens. I have seen it twice in two different cities, and both were sell outs.  If it had opened on twice as many screens, it would have made twice a many dollars.  As great as the ticket sales are, they a still over shadowed by one POWERFULL movie.",The Passion of the Christ

Jesus is love...and the only way to live the abundant life is to trust Him with yours...He makes all things new!  I am blessed that Mel had the guts to make this film and pray that all Christians will live out our faith and hold each other accountable to depend on Christ to love others with the love our Father has freely given us.  His love changes lives and gives hope and true joy.  There is no relationship or thing outside of Jesus Christ that can give stability and strength, and make life have purpose.

It followed the Gospels as I have read them quite closely and gave the feeling of being right there in history.  The English subtitles were not nearly as bothersome as I expected and after awhile they didn't matter at all.  The actors, actresses, costumes and scenery were incredibly real and took you back to Biblical times.  The movie showed the depth of Jesus' love and forgiveness, the pain and suffering he endured for our sins, and his obedience to God's will in fulfilling prophecies of the Scriptures.  It was very difficult to watch the graphic brutality, yet I believe it was necessary to reveal the suffering Jesus endured on our behalf.  It brought this part of the Bible to life.  I will definitely see this movie again and would recommend it to anyone who is a Christian or who maybe just wonders what Jesus did for us.",The Passion of the Christ
1864,CSmart_1970,Two thumbs up,10,9 March 2004,"This film is an enormously accurate portrayal of Jesus' sacrifice.  I recommend everyone over the age of 13 see it.  While graphic and violent the sacrifice that was made by Jesus would have been trivialized to portray it any other way.  The depth of emotion that Christians will feel is not describable.  Overwhelmed, humbled, ashamed of their (our) own transgressions.  Their is no Anti-Semitism.  Only those who dispute the New Testament would make such a statement.  Christians know that not only were Mary and Jesus Jews but that the Jews are God's chosen people and the New Testament assures us that during the tribulation we will see a mass conversion of Jews to Christianity.  Those who would have you believe that Jesus was not the Messiah may take exception to this but it is my belief that that is their own fear that makes them paranoid and critical.",The Passion of the Christ
1865,kalrocksoldier,Simply amazing piece of film making!!,10,9 March 2004,"Mel Gibson has made a truly remarkable piece of artwork here.This film will rival the greatest films made in the past and most certainly will raise the bar very high for future film makers. For another to match such an astonishing vision of an historic event will be extremely difficult.This is brilliant, matching Spielberg's ""Shindler's List"" and the Civil War film ""Glory"" to name a couple films I was most impressed with in the past. The re-enactment of the 12 hours leading to Christ's crucifixion is as compelling as the first ten minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", showing the horror to which the men in both films were subjected.I'm just in awe of this masterpiece and recommend it for mature teens and most adults. The actor's portrayals are superb and the cinematography is spectacular.A must see!!",The Passion of the Christ

JESUS would have done that just for you or me only as well as for the whole world!! NOW THATS LOVE!!!!!!!!How many of you out there would have done the same thing? After watching this movie did it make you want to invite JESUS into you heart? That's what it's all about, not religion but relationship with JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR. He just wants us to trust and believe as well as your time to build a strong healthy relationship in him, which is not asking for much considering what he has done for us correction what he is always doing for us. I myself have just recently became a christian due to me thinking of what JESUS has done for me.

I was wondering whether or not this movie could live up to even half of the hype and let me tell you it does. The movie is a feast for the eyes. The acting is second to none. And this movie grabs you from the opening shot in the garden to the last shot at the empty tomb. Don't be surprised if  this film win some award next year. don't let anyone tell you not to see this film. It might be brutal but the message that it gives is needed in this world today more then any other.

It is not an easy film to view, as one should expect. Being based around the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, you know there is a high likelihood that it is going to test your ability to deal with the reality and the pain. As a child of 6 or 7 continued to kick the back of my seat, early in the movie, I realized that my patience was in short supply. After I let the adults with him know that he should show better manners, I felt maybe I had approached that simple inconvenience a little more harshly than I would if I was watching ""Along came Polly"". My heightened senses made me wish the movie would move along a little faster but, as I said early on, you are in this for the duration and that should be why you purchased your ticket. A few patrons walked out. Most stayed. At the end, my friends and I immediately began the debate of what we all felt regarding the many aspects of the film. It reminded me of why it is good practice not to discuss politics or religion in most social situations. All in all, this film should be experienced with raw nerves exposed and tolerance close at hand.",The Passion of the Christ
1869,mina-gereis,Excellent experience.. 2 thumbs up!,10,10 March 2004,"This is the best movie about Christ I have ever seen. The historic events, dialogue, and the depiction of the physical & emotional pains that Christ had to suffer feel so real, it makes your heart ache!! Yes it's violent and at some points gruesome, but not just for the sake of it; this is what happened for real, not less, if not worse.Everything is so accurate in this movie, except for the nails in the crucifixion scene. As scientists have discovered after studying the Holy Shroud of Christ in Turin, the nails were driven through the wrists of the hands not the palms; this is a common misunderstanding, but nevertheless, a very minor issue, and doesn't really count as a flow.The languages (Aramaic & Latin) give the movie a very strange sense of reality and authenticity!I recommend this movie to everyone, both Christians and non-believers. For us Christians, this is a major eye-opener, since that most of us aren't very aware about `The Passion of Christ' and how painful it was for him to endure all of it for OUR sins! As for non-believers, it's movie magic in all its glory; everyone will enjoy it, powerful story, amazing acting talents, awesome makeup and effects, and a breathtaking soundtrack.However, this movie should not be displayed to children, or to people who can't watch violence.",The Passion of the Christ

I would want everyone in the world to see this movie this movie really touched me in a no other movie has.  I finally realized my wrong doings while watching this movie and it really made me want to change my life.  Even when i got home i didnt stop thinking about the movie and im still thinking about it now.  I hope that people go and see this movie and realize that they as well need to chang their life.

1872,fxavierg,This Can't be compared to any other movie I've seen,10,11 March 2004,"I've just seen this movie. And I liked it. Never have I felt to have spent so well my money in the ticket to se it. The violence is immense, but that is to make us feel how different this man was from all other. I do not have any religion, but I truly admire Christ and the way he offered himself for a cause he strongly believed in. I had already read all the gospels from the bible, and you can be sure of one thing: this is correctly made. Of course there are some gaps that have to be filled, but there is nothing in the Jesus character beyonde the gospells. Some said that said that we can't take the gospels litteraly, that is truth, but the movie of the Ten Commandment take the bible literally, nevertheless it is a great classical movie, or isn't it? Those who have said that, probably have seen movies based on novels, and do you take it literally, or do you only watch documentaries? Is or is not, for example, The Last Temptation of Christ a great movie? What is different about this one, is that mankind is shown how it trully is: cruel. And when we see someone taking all kinds of cruel punishments for an ideal, we say: that isn't true. And we say this because we wouldn't be capable of that. Why do we always judge the others in comparison to what we are or are not? It is impossible to make a comparison with other movies, this is unic. This a piece of art, whether you like it or not. As to all the ""blind"" criticism about the movie, well, Jewish are not seen as the bad ones, as in all countries, there are bad people and good people. The violence is extreme, but do we think about the Roman Empire as the paradise on earth for those that weren't roman citizens, and that were criminals? But, of course, this is a movie that is talknig about a worldwide religion, but to be a piece of art as to be original, and as to bring something new, otherwise would just be a movie like any movie about Christ. When I was reading all the posts I came into a question ""why is Pilate portrayed so nicely?"" Well in the gospel according to John Pilate is portrayed as really wanting to make Jesus escape from the crucification, probably the answer is in the question Pilate makes to Jesus: What is the truth? It is never said what Jesus' answer was, and probably if he had said it, today we could be talking of him as really the son of God, or as to someone that had a theory about truth, but that proved to be wrong. The movie has a very important message, ""love those who love you and those who are your enemies"". That was what Jesus did 'til he died.",The Passion of the Christ

To all those voters that gave the movie a 1, most likely for religious beliefs it is sad that you cant open your eyes to a piece of art and except it. It was nice to see a movie that was based around such great acting that you didn't have to read the words to understand what the character was feeling or what emotions he had to express. I thought Jim gave an Oscar preformance. Move over Sean Penn the next generation of actor is coming though. As for the studios I am so happy that Mel made his money back.

For those who have yet to see this movie, keep in mind that Mel Gibson comes from a Catholic backround and it is from a more Catholic point of view.  It stays pretty true to the stories in the Holy Bible,  however there are a few differences.  For instance in the Bible, Judas is not chased off by demons, and there is no reference to a dead horse judging him. But I can see symbolisim in this.  If you had betrayed the Son of God would you not be chased off by the demons of your mind?  Perhaps this is what Gibson was saying.  But it is my understanding that Catholics see Judas below all, even Hitler.  That he had betrayed Christ for his own financial gain. But what if Judas had betrayed Christ for a seprate reason.  If you knew someone with all that power,  would you not want that person to help free the Jews from the Romans? Perhaps Judas was just trying to force Christ's hand, but he refused because it was not in the plan? As far as violence goes,  if you have a weak stomach or are very suseptable to guilt,  then this is not a movie for you.  I walked out of the theaters feeling like utter crap. The whipping scene seemed to last 20 minutes,  I couldn't even watch the screen.  I would have to say,  that scene was worse than when he was staked to the cross.  It is apalling to think that a human being could do this to a living thing,  let alone another human being.  It is also unbelievable that a person could live through such abuse before giving up their own life.  If Christ had the ability to give up his spirit at any time,  why then did he wait till he was on the cross?  He didn't die for our sins,  he bled for them up on the mount.",The Passion of the Christ
1875,BKKK,"Cairo, Egypt",10,29 April 2004,"The movie is magnificent, magical, awesome... Truly a very blessed work with a very powerful message of love.
Mel Gibson is a great person to come up with an idea like that, to stand up for his beliefs and create this movie...I would rate the movie 12/10! Besides, I don't see it anti-semitic at all. I didnt have any negative feelings towards the Jews after coming out of the movie...Yes, there's alot of blood and violent scenes, but whats wrong with that? I mean no doubt Jesus has been terribly wounded and hurt for us. Just because Mel potrayed that reality into a movie rather than words, people got dissapointed?!!
It's a perfect movie, moving into tears in various scenes!The music of the film can't be better, rightly composed to suit such a movie like THE PASSION!It's the best movie I've ever watched, my favourite! :)",The Passion of the Christ
1876,rjsii,Absolutely moving and true to scripture,10,12 March 2004,"To say I was moved is an understatement. I have never seen such a true to life (as scripture states) film in my entire life. I do not care about all the hype or downgrading by so called enlightened people who feel compelled to speak to this movie and its' meaning. It is a sad commentary to those naysayers who have not the integrity to respond from thier hearts and not thier editors or readership. There are none so blind, as those who will not see. I give Mel credit for his drive and desire to create such a epic, and I am so glad that the film moguls in Hollywood would not partake in the making and distribution of this film. It is VERY apparent that they only have a vision of their own needs and resources and not the need for truth and true realism. Hollywood really reflects its' name, in that the name says nothing, and only speaks to those needing fame and fortune.",The Passion of the Christ
1877,hhoward,excellent portrayal of Christ's last hours,10,12 March 2004,"I found this movie to be a real heart and eye opener for myself personally. I am a Christian and to actually see an example of what Christ went through because of my sins really helped me to understand His sacrifice better.  I am grateful that Mel Gibson had the desire and courage to make such a wonderful movie.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone to see but especially for Christians; anyone that I've talked to(who has seen this film and who is a Christian) about this movie agrees with me that they have a must clearer vision of Christ's sacrifice.  They agree that they have been changed because of it.  Yes, the movie is violent but it is a re-enactment of what happened to Christ so why are people so appalled by it.  I personally believe it is either they don't believe that Christ actually existed or that he actually was crucified or they don't like to be confronted by the truth about his death and resurrection.  I pray that anyone who sees this movie will be changed because of it. By changed I mean converted to Christianity and dedicate their lives to out Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  Thank You.",The Passion of the Christ
1878,Valentyne21480,This is an example of cinema as art.,10,12 March 2004,"Well.  I very rarely go to a theater to watch a film.  But all the commotion surrounding this one demanded I go and see it.Riveting, absolutely riveting.  I'm not thrown off by gore, so that part wasn't much of a problem.  I noted, though, in a theater seating nearly 200 people, only 1 left after the beating started.The anti-semitists say this film is an example of how the Jews had Christ crucified. If you watch the movie in an educated manner, you'll come to realize that it wasn't as much as who was the party as it was a mob rule incited by one religious leader seemingly worried about his standing.After seeing this movie, I was stunned. I, like everyone in the West, am well aware of what happened to the Nazarene. But Gibson exquisitely crafted a dramatic piece of his last 12 hours. Yes, there were technical glitches. (Dood, was it the frozen yogurt? That dead dude blinked.) And we could have done without the apparitions and miracles.  And the weather at the moment of his death. But Hollywood creeps into every story, it seems, fiction or fact.It may be only March, but this is a lock for the Oscar, I think.Jesus was one tough mother. I hope for his sake and ours, that he's right. I'm an atheist turned agnostic. (Better to question and hope that there's an eternal afterlife than believe in nothing at all.  Like this is a losing proposition? :P)",The Passion of the Christ
1879,Heartbreak_One,Probably the most anti-Semitic film since the Nazi propaganda films,1,28 February 2013,"The only reason this film made as much money as it did, and was as popular as it was it because of the religious connotations it has. If you put all the religious baggage aside and look at film purely as a film, it is horrendous. Clocking in at 2 hours and seven minutes, this film easily takes double the time necessary to describe Jesus' final hours. Most of this time is spent giving the audience close up shots of Jesus being brutally beaten, whipped, and finally crucified. Once the crucifixion process begins, the film basically degenerates into something out of the saw series, and in any other light would be considered pornographic violence. After watching this for about and hour, you start wishing for someone to just kill Jesus so the film will end. The over-dramatization of the ""sacrifice"" gets so completely ridiculous at points that it is almost laughable. Change the setting slightly and you might as well be watching 300, which would be an enormous improvement. Beyond the over the top violence, this film is the most anti-Semitic piece I have seen since the propaganda films of the Nazi regime. Throughout the entire film, not a single good Jewish person is seen, and they are painted as completely reprehensible, awful, and scummy people on the planet. It is sickening.To sum up, The Passion of the Christ is too long, too over the top, and extremely anti-Semitic, and without the shroud of religion surrounding it, it would have just been a failed documentary. Sound good to you?I didn't think so.",The Passion of the Christ
1880,PmPmIS,Reflection of One's Self,10,13 March 2004,I went to this movie and have since seen it twice not because I like blood but to see if I had missed anything in a guide to help the questions I was sure to get about this movie. I thought Mel Gibson lived his faith the movie was disturbing Jesus trial beatings and death were brutal and yes he did not go entirely with the bible it is a tale of the Christ. He put his heart and soul into this movie. I found the movie wonderfully done and cause for much reflection. As for the actor who portrayed Jesus he also is to commended for such challenge and accepting the challenge. It takes courage to go against Hollywood and these people have showed Hollywood and others that the majority of people still love God.,The Passion of the Christ
1881,justykob,it is excellent film!,7,13 March 2004,"Very good cinema, although may be too strong. I am a film critic from Europe and I prefer less literary cinema. But it is an  excellent and moving cinema, I think that this film should be shown rather in the church than in the cinema. Because it is a picture for believers. In my opinion this film is not anti- semitic at all, and such supposition is completly unjustified.It is a tale about a immense suffering and sacrifice. Many peole want this film to be dissregarded.Why? The answer is simple. It is enough to see the film.I personally,would give Oscar for the best actress to Maia MOrgenstern starring Christ's mother.I hope, it will happen.",The Passion of the Christ
1882,Nycbella05,The best movie of Christ!,10,13 March 2004,"When i went to go see "" The Passion of the Christ"" with my mother and friends, I cried my eyes out. Knowing the fact that Jesus died for our sins and the world still isn't good, made me realize that I  also need to change. I give this movie a 10/10 because, Mel Gibson had EVERY right to show that Jesus is everything!!!!This movie caused so much anger, in the Jewish community, because they thought that we ( as in non-Jews) would come back with religious slurs.When it isn't all about them. We, for those of us who are christians, know that Jesus died to bare the sins of the world and that's that. No bad acting was involved, it was exactly how the bible portrays it, and it has great direction!!!! No other movie based on a true story has made me cry from the start, of Jesus in the garden, to the end, of him being Resurrected!!!!",The Passion of the Christ
1883,sbthielman,Fantastic,10,13 March 2004,"What a moving, gracious movie.  I think it may be the best movie ever made. It transcends the medium. The images of this movie have been  with me for days.  Not in a disturbing sense, but in that they deepened my understanding of Christ.  Is this a movie just for Christians?  Certainly not.  Unless a person has hardened themselves to the biblical message, I think most people will come away awed and reflective about the meaning of the crucifixion. In many ways, this movie is simply a new Catholic reflection on the crucifixion.  There is nothing uniquely violent in its portrayal of the event at all.  Christians have been portraying the violence of this event for 2000 years, and we've all thought in depth about the violence presented. There's nothing surprising or shocking here.  Also, the movie makes perfectly clear that Christ gave his life as a sacrifice, it was not taken from him.  He was in control.  That's what makes the violence more bearable and also what makes it unlike any other movie violence I've ever seen.",The Passion of the Christ

It didn't seem like a movie. It was very real! Often I couldn't read the subtitles for the tears that filled my eyes.This is a movie I would see again and encourage everyone to see at least once! Mel Gibson is to be commended for his courage in producing such a picture and for his comittment to the Truth! The storyline held close to the Scripture and in the areas that were 'added' (ie: Satan in the Garden and elsewhere and the additional parts with Pilate's wife) in no way detracted from the purity of the message.,The Passion of the Christ

The movie was really gory but it was the truth. I feel bad for what really happened to him. I hope Mel Gibson will make more movies, he did an amazing job. Good storyline and casting gives this movie two thumbs up for me. Good soundtrack is a plus. Went alittle overboard with the blood but seeing as it is true I give it a plus. All in all an amazing film. Like I said 10 out of 10. I recomend it to any christian. not for little ones though.

It is a profoundly moving film in so many ways.  Yes it is violent, and some parts I could not even watch. You also see there is so much love from Jesus that it is breathtaking.  You finally get the message that Jesus came to die for all of our sins, no matter how difficult this may be for Him.   This movie reminds many of us that we know story, but it puts all the suffering in your FACE.  You leave feeling like you never want to sin again.  At least that is how I felt. You can't even talk when it is over, but you can cry. Now I HAVE to see it again!I sincerely hope Hollywood ""gets it"" and will bring back decent movies and some good Christian films.

Every actor in this movie along with the crew deserves to be noticed,it was beautifully acted. I feel a totally renewed faith and will recommend this movie to everyone I know.I feel all the controversy was totally un-warranted.  This movie does not make me hate the Jews or the Romans for that matter.  I know that Christ died for me because He chose to do so.  He loved us so that he gave his life for us.

Knowing how the story went, we sat there and were still surprised.  Not because any poetic license was used.  Not because any large scale special effects were shown.  We were surprised at one thing...TRUTH. The movie comes at you with, ""In your face"" shock that you can not help but be amazed.  Seeing the extent of the hatered, and what they did to my Lord, renewed my faith, in God, and in the industry I've come to despise.

I have to say that I don't think that this movie gives a Anti-semitic idea, in the matter of fact, if the Jews defend this opinion, probably the italians can argue that this movie transmits a vision of the ancient romans as drunks, incompetents and unresponsives. I don't think that people must judge other people based upon the message that one movie gives. It's our duty to creat our own ideas, vision, and understadings from our own experience. Try to see this movie by seeing the message of love, faith and suffering that he transmits, by the beauty of his images, dialogues.",The Passion of the Christ
1890,mcons,I am not worthy,10,15 March 2004,"Gibson might have gone over the top on violence.  He may have gotten a little melodramatic with the big crack in the Temple that featured special effects that would not have looked that good back in the Silent Era. There are other items that I could take issue with.But as a Christian who has seriously been trying to follow Christ for a long time, I must say this movie completely tore me up.  I knew intellectually about the scourging, the bearing of the cross, and the crucifixion, but this has given it a vibrancy that I never could have gotten any other way.Did I like this movie?  No way.  Would I recommend it?  Wholeheartedly.
Yes, they could have left out about 2/3 of the violence and I would have still gotten the message on that.  But there was so much that was so right. Pilate's political expediency.  The craftiness of the Pharisees to manipulate Pilate, even though he had ultimate power over them.  The ultra-human weakness of the disciples.  The depth of a Mother's love.  The horrible evil, personified by the androgynous Satan, but also shown in the acts of all of the human players.Most of all, I love the way Christ was portrayed.  It was as close as I have seen to being what I have always imagined.  A friendly, charismatic (with a lower-case ""C""), tender man, but a man in the best sense of the word.  So many movies have portrayed Christ as a morose dullard who mopes from one scene to the next almost making me wish the crucifixion would be the end of the story.  This portrayal of Christ makes you sure the Resurrection is inevitable, not because he is so likable, which he is, but because he is so humble, so accessible.  He is the God of the Gospels...a real friend who will love you even when you stumble, but who won't let you live life in the wrong lane, always gently guiding you to get your heart right.
I am not worthy of such a friend.  I am not worthy of a friend who would endure what he endured to make my heart right, in spite of my own nature. This movie deepened that conviction radically.",The Passion of the Christ
1891,claire-smith15,mind blowing,9,3 April 2004,"this film left me stunned.it was shocking.I have never seen such torture on the screen,it was one of those films that you wanted to walk out on but felt compelled to stay to the end.Mel Gibson excelled himself with this film,i am not a fan of anything he has done up to this film(acting or directing)but i think his name will go down in cinema history as having the guts to follow his heart.The raw emotion on the faces of all the cast was surreal.I left thinking that i had seen something that will be talked about for years to come.I was wary of seeing this film,firstly because of the subtitles,but i think they were almost not needed,the actors let their faces tell the story.Maia Morgenstern was(Mary)was particularly brilliant,she put so much passion into her performance. i feel it is a film everyone should see at least once in their lifetime,i doubt i will see it again,the impression it left on me i will never forget.

This film was gripping and was not filled with meaningless dialogue. For once, I did not mind the sub titles. This is one film where actions definitely spoke much louder than words. Every lash he received I shuddered and flinched. I could not help it. It was like I was meant to feel this. It really makes one think about life and your feelings toward mankind. My philosophy has always been 'Do unto others as you would have done unto you' and I live by this at work or at play. More people should see this film, especially those who are quick to judge others.

I advise this movie to any one that is debating on seeing it! I thought that I didn't want to see it at first because I didn't want to see him suffer but it helped me visualize exactly what he went through and made it realer for me.

I think it was good to do so because, without humor life on this ""human"" world would be unbearable.  Only one other person that saw the movie was able to tell me which was the ""comedy"" scene in the movie.  Albeit the message of the movie was one of redemption, it saddens me that most people can not see that even in our darkest hours a little humor goes a long way to lighten the load we bear as humans.The ""comedy"" scene (as I call it) helped me to realize the true ""human"" side of Jesus and to better understand that he really did suffer as a ""man"".Beyond that I was most moved by the words spoken by Jesus.  Even though I have heard, read and comtemplated his words during his time of suffering I was unable to fully visualize what agony and pain He was subjected to. Seeing Jesus in that condition and hearing him utter words of truth, love and forgivness is mind-blowing.

It is true to the Bible and made me realize what Christ had to do to complete His mission. This movie is an excellent example of what a crucifixion truly was. The cast could not have been more perfect! There are comments such as ""If Jesus actually received the amount of punishment dished out in this film, he would have been dead three times over before arriving at Calvary."" If he died before the crucifixion, His mission would have not been complete and we have to remember that Jesus was true man and true God!

It makes you think, what have I did that added to his pain.  Are we worthy? For this the answer would have to be NO, but he loved us just the same.  I enjoyed seeing the disciples as individuals that we can identify with.  I thought that he made even Judas have some redeeming qualities.  It also made me recheck with the Bible because I thought some things were liberties he had taken with the scriptures when in fact all the things that I check are in the scriptures.

I felt that I was somehow transported back to the actual Crucifixion of my Lord and Saviour. Even though many scenes were hard for me to watch, anything less would have not been so realistic.  I am a born-again Christian, and I do not view the film as being anti-semitic, or a condemnation of all Romans for that matter.  The message is that we are all guilty of crucifying Christ.  And yet HE gave Himself for us, without it, there would be no hope for mankind, we would all be condemned.  This is the greatest love story of all time!

Personally I do not see this film as anti-semitic and do not see how this movie criticises the modern Jew any more than ""Prince of Egypt"" criticises the modern Egyptians. I think though, that anyone seeing this movie must watch it with the forewarned information that this is a religious movie. It is difficult, therefore, to judge under normal circumstances. It is not an especially creative movie as the subject material does not allow for too much poetic licence before it becomes heretical, in the mind of the pious Christian. The director has obviously tried to make the most pious film that he could so a viewer should not be surprised if he or she is confronted with an extremely orthodox interpretation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. If the viewer is prepare to watch the film with that understanding then he or she is free to criticise or praise the film depending on how faithfully they believe that Mr Gibson has represented the crucifixion. To judge the movie as one would judge ""The Terminator"" is a useful as comparing ""The Koran"" with ""Harry Potter"". See this movie in these terms and your enjoyment of the film will be enhanced.

The main actor and director were excellent. The opening was very unusual the portrayal of the Devil communicating with the sad, scared, and emotional Jesus who was trying to gain strength in prayer to be able to face what was coming. The actress that played Mary the mother of Jesus had a very strong face language very sad at times. I thought that I would see more crying or sobbing by Mary the mother of Jesus, when witnessing the way he was treated, looking at his bloody beaten body and face and still being kicked and pushed around. The actor that plays Pilate was very good. I did not see what the controversy was all about. The movie is about the passion of the Christ.",The Passion of the Christ

As a true christian then you would not blame one religion for the lord's death, but would blame all of mankind. Everyone of us has sinned and all of us are to blame for his death. There was nothing the jews could do about it because it was already foretold.  This was an excellent movie for anyone to go see.

1901,jcw9682,Educate yourselves before attending this film.,10,20 March 2004,"By now, most people have heard what a great (or disgusting) film this is, so I will spare the play-by-play.  I personally believe that ""The Passion"" is on par with ""Schindler's List"" and ""Braveheart"", and it is by far the best film playing right now.  I, as well as many patrons, left the theater speechless and in awe.  The experience was comparable to nothing else. The acting, music, and overall cinematography is unparalleled, and Gibson is being amply rewarded for his efforts.I find it hard to believe that anyone (but unbelievers) could dislike this film.  Most of the bad reviews on this film are inane and laughable (ex. reviews that pan the film because of violence). Many dissenting critics take this film out of it's proper context and allude to the violence ""as being done out of hate and not love"".  These critics fail to see the big picture and therefore should not be taken seriously.  I find it peculiar that rap music has to be put in its ""proper context"" to be understood, yet this movie is frequently taken out of context and panned by many uneducated viewers. I ask that people please educate themselves and read the four Gospels before attending this movie, for doing so will foster a better overall understanding of this wonderfully stimulating film.",The Passion of the Christ

First of all, any historian will tell you that this is how things happened at that time. The brutality shown in the movie might even be less than what truly happened. By showing this brutality, Mel Gibson shows us how wonderful Christ's sacrifice was. He accepted to go through the worst suffering ever and to endure what no other man could in order to save us and this is just wonderful. So please stop looking at the movie just to find something bad to say about it and try to understand its true meaning. I have always been a huge fan of Mel Gibson and after this movie all I can say is BRAVO!!!! This is a man who gave humanity one of the most beautiful gifts ever BRAVO!!!!

1903,2000diamante,the passion,10,28 November 2004,"A Masterpiece of film-making and what movies were meant to do; The Passion tells a story, historically accurate and profound. A story read by many, pondered on by fewer and believed by even fewer still, the Passion does what no other form of media is capable of doing; it draws all the senses together and let's you feel the story of the Gospels. Like all movies that are based on a true story, it goes out on a limb in a few places to fill in the gaps, where books are free to be ambiguous but movies are not. Yet those places are few and far between and in my opinion actually fit the story quite well. We may never know in this lifetime whether the fill-ins are accurate, but I see no greater harm being done then when believers speculate in private as to ""this or that"".A professional ""critic"" Ty Burr, of the Boston Globe, stated that the movie was too much focused on gore and not theology and A.O. Scott, of the New York Times, stated that the film seems to arise less from love than from wrath; to which I have to say I'll never read the reviews of these men again. I make this statement confidently, since I, as an occasional moviegoer was able to find what they somehow missed. It's not as though I am the only one, at the time of this writing eleven reviews with an average of ""A"" have been written by the professionals; all but these two are rated high. Therefore I am more inclined to believe that ulterior motives are behind the negative remarks and I find that very unprofessional.A closer look at the criticisms reveals the impractical and unwarranted nature of the attacks. To say that the film lacks theology demands a comparative, that is to say, compared to what? Certainly not your average film, I don't know of too many films that are rich in theology. Comparing the film to other Christian movies, such as the famous one by Charlton Heston, is not comparing apples to apples, in the sense that you expect the Mel Gibson film to be more a dramatic experience than a dry narrative. Don't get me wrong the movies of the past are great in their own respect, but the most dramatic they ever attempt to get is voice inflection, when Charlton lowers his voice and says ""Let my people go"". It's the difference between the Discovery Channel's special on the Holocaust and Schindler's list - both are valuable and both need to be graded based on their own genre. What is surprising is that the movie maintains such a large degree of historical accuracy, not that it is lacking in any or lacking a theological lecture; something the movie was never intended to be. To the charge of a lack of love, I am awestruck. The love that the man Jesus shows is exactly what Christians have maintained for over two millennia. It is the story of a man, wrongly and falsely condemned who shows compassion for those ""who do not know what they are doing"" and who even a sinner dying besides the man Jesus, recognizes as not worthy the punishment but ""praying for you"" in the midst of the horrible torture. ""No greater love has a man, than this..."" cannot be escaped as you watch the film. Truly a most horrible oversight by a self proclaimed ""professional"". All having been said, I am a better person for having watched this movie. Paul Harvey said it best when he said: ""You don't watch this movie, you experience it!"" Perhaps it is due to our multi-media culture, that I have grown up in, or an overall dumbing down of the populace - but I don't seem to be able to create the drama of the film in my mind, when I read a book or listen to a tape. Some people have been blessed with that ability, but not I. For me then, the movie does what no other form of media can, and with the small discrepancies and conjecture on the part of the movie and director aside, I am thankful and proud to recommend Gibson's work.",The Passion of the Christ
1904,sherrylewis777,Movie of all Movies!,10,21 March 2004,"For the first time since the making of Christian movies, that depicted Jesus going to the cross, was a portion of reality allowed to be portrayed in accuracy according to the Holy Bible.  For all of the skeptics out there, Mel Gibson is the only one that ever came close to hitting the truth of what the Lord Jesus Christ went through for us. In the book of Isaiah 52:14 (speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ) it states, ""Many were amazed when they saw him - beaten and bloodied, so disfigured one would scarcely know he was a person. (New Living Translation)."" If everyone read their Bibles they would see it in Black & White for themselves.  Mel Gibson did not write history, he just portrayed it and he did an excellent job.  The death of Jesus should not be downplayed as some movie directors have done in the past.  It's time the truth came out.  FOR THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE!",The Passion of the Christ
1905,kglenn17,Thank You Mel Gibson,10,22 March 2004,Thank you Mel Gibson for making and believing in the best film ever made. It is the ultimate story of good -vs- evil. No more no less.  I do not understand why religious groups would get offended by this movie. Not one religious group was pointed out or blamed; good -vs- evil is what it was about.  I left the theatre with so many emotions but the one that has stuck with me is love.  I was so humbled by this movie and came away with wanting to do more to help my fellow man and to show love not only to my family and friends but also to strangers and enemies.  Maybe this world would be a better place if a movie could inspire that in everyone.  Thank you Mr. Gibson for doing what you believed in and giving the world a life altering experience in a 2-hour span.,The Passion of the Christ
1906,agcs,Amazing,10,22 March 2004,"I have seen the Passion twice now, and it is so effective in showing you how Christ died for our sins.  Yes, it was violent, but Christ suffered even more terribly than what was shown on screen.  He was beaten so that he was unrecognizable.  Our Priest at Church said this movie displayed just the tip of how Christ suffered. The movie has forever left a mark on me and it is the first time I have ever picked up the Bible and read it.  My son who is fourteen saw the movie and said he was proud that he was a Christian and he understands that Christ was beaten for all of our sins.  The portrayal of Jesus and Mary was unbelievable.  The scene when Jesus falls and Mary remembers him falling as a small child, ripped right through me.  It showed the love of a mother for a child and I will never forget it.  Mel Gibson was led to do this movie and I am enternally grateful to him.",The Passion of the Christ

The story was so wonderfully portrayed. Although it was so intensely graphic that I wouldn't let me 5 year old watch it, I am glad it was there. The whole movie made me reflect upon what really happened on the cross and to analyze my relationship with Christ. I am also so glad they did it in what I believe was Aramaic. I think to have put it in English would have ruined the whole effect. I feel that this is a film that can be experienced and then reflected upon in in a way that makes you appreciate what the cross really means to you and what was really sacrificed that day. Thank you, Mel Gibson, for being brave enough to stand up for Jesus Christ!",The Passion of the Christ
1908,trourke,Focuses Correctly on A Central Christian Mystery,10,22 March 2004,"If ever there has been a film accompanied by a preponderance of unhelpful reviews, this is it.  ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a very well-acted and well-directed film, with Jim Caviezel delivering the performance of a lifetime. The film is deeply engaging emotionally from the outset.  This reviewer found the use of the ancient languages a factor heightening the realism and engaging him more deeply. Admittedly, it is probably more true of this film than others that what one gets out of it is related to what one brings to it. For believers, who accept the significance of Christ's Passion as redemptive in nature, the scenes of pain and violence will have a profound meaning.  Gibson does a great job of communicating that meaning, particularly in the way he juxtaposes the action with events from the life of Christ.  For the theologically-inclined, the film underlines the Eucharistic and Marian themes. Obviously, a film about a crucifixion--a method of execution designed to maximize cruelty and to terrorize people into submission--is going to be violent.  Although one can question whether or not all the violence was absolutely necessary, this reviewer did not see it as detracting from the quality of the film. The problem is not with the film as much as it is that the Anglo-Saxon world and much of modern Christianity has tended to sanitize the crucifixion, often preferring to depict a cross with no body on it.  Latin Americans, on the other hand, have been much more realistic in their depictions of the suffering Christ, lacerated and bleeding. The extra-biblical elements in the film, such as the presence of the diabolical, support rather than detract from the biblical themes.  Above and beyond this, be aware that much of the hostile criticism of the film is based on a poor grasp of the Christian tradition.  The Passion of Jesus has always been seen by Christians as central to the faith, and the doctrine of Christ's redemptive suffering is as old as Christianity itself. The shedding of the blood was of immense significance in the theological milieu in which Christianity originated.  Mel Gibson is giving the traditional interpretation of the Passion that would have been understand as such in the ancient Church.  A great movie- highly recommended.",The Passion of the Christ
1909,wlfrdgrvs,Powerful Movie!,10,22 March 2004,"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a masterpiece!  The film explores the beauty of sacrificial love and the ugliness of human cruelty. `The Passion' will undoubtedly strengthen the faith of Christians as it vividly portrays the redemptive suffering of the Savior.  Even many non-believers will come to appreciate the depths of human depravity, the need for salvation, and the power of forgiveness.  I believe that most people who view this film will take from it something of spiritual value and eternal significance.I saw `The Passion' three times within the first ten days of its release. Each cinematic experience moved me to tears as I reflected on my own culpability in the death of Jesus.  The movie creatively dramatizes the Biblical accounts, but also remains faithful to the message of the text. `The Passion' sensitively presents the principal characters of the story without idealizing or over-sentimentalizing them.  `The Passion' reveals humanity at its highest and lowest points, and at all points in between.
Some `Jesus' films overly emphasize Christ's divinity to the exclusion of his humanity.  `The Passion' is more balanced in its portrayal of Christ. Although Christ in Gibson's film is the Son of God, he is also the Son of Man who honestly struggles with the enormity of the burden that he alone must carry.  `The Passion' sparked within me a concern for Jesus Christ far greater than that sparked by any other film.  Someone that I care about was on that movie screen!  If you have not done so already, please go see `The Passion' today!  I highly recommend it to anyone who seeks a greater appreciation for all that Christ did for humanity.",The Passion of the Christ
1910,Riain,The Passion of the Christ Myth,1,23 March 2004,"The Jesus Christ of the Gospels could not possibly have been a real person. He is a combination of impossible elements. There may have lived in Palestine, nineteen centuries ago, a man whose name was Jesus, who went about doing good, who was followed by admiring associates, and who in the end met a violent death. This Jesus, if he lived, was a man. When the world shall have learned that the Christ of the Gospels is a myth, that Christianity is untrue, it will turn its attention from the religious fictions of the past to the vital problems of today, and endeavor to solve them for the improvement of the well-being of the real men and women whom we know, and whom we ought to help and love.",The Passion of the Christ
1911,roakley,Love taken to another level,10,24 March 2004,"As I watched this film, I was partly in shock and partly in tears. I have read the Bible many times about how Christ died for me and I tried to picture it in my mind but could not do it justice.  I have also read how violent Roman's were when they crucified their prisioners. Mel Gibson did a very good job of putting into pictures the pain and torture that Christ took for all when he died for our sins.  I saw a new meaning of the word LOVE. In John 3:16, For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him would not perish, but have everlasting life. The Bible said that God is LOVE and it also took LOVE to take the beatings and to hang on the cross for this our sins. We are so undeserving the gift of sacrifice that Jesus gave to all.  The Bible also says that He could have call 10,000 angels down from heaven to remove him from the cross, but he didn't. He stayed there so that I and everyone else who accepts Him will have life with Him eternal in Heaven. I have a different view now of Christ's Passion as Mel has so correctly titled this film. I get emotional now when I think back on this film. Thank you Mel Gibson for being obedient when God guided you in this direction and thank you God for sending your Son to die in my place. LOVE will never have the same meaning for me again and I will not take for granted the sacrifice HE gave for me. Christ took LOVE to another level. For all of the critics that say the torture that the Roman soldiers gave Christ and being nailed to the cross wasn't that violent, read your history before you voice your opinion. All deaths under Ceasar were violent. Most did not have to endure both a beating and the cross like Christ. That is what makes Christ death unique.",The Passion of the Christ
1912,jochem_mud,it's even worst than expected,2,25 March 2004,"This movie is one of the worst ones about biblical stories i have ever seen. The drama and heavyness seems very outdated, and by that i mean a couple of centuries outdated. Also the approach of the story is so extremely Christian, that for a non Christian or even a liberal catholic it's really hard to watch.Another point of irritation was the Aragorn likeness playing Christ. This really reminded me of the way renaissance painters paint scenes from the bible with all the characters looking like Europeans. Jesus was a Jew! Not a hero from the King Arthur stories! This unrealistic way of casting really bothered me. Then there's the scenery, switching from a Tim Burton-like beginning to a scene that could have been taken from a Hellraiser movie with Jesus whipped to shreds.Now I come to think of it, the only thing I liked about this movie was the music. Especially the heavy churchy-sounding bit at the end of the movie.I can only suggest people, don't waste your money on this movie.

Jim Caviezel truly became Jesus on the screen, never have I watched a movie and not noticed the ""acting"" -- he doesn't act.  He just is.  It is intense, horrific, and sadly beautiful all at the same time.  Won't it be a shame that when it is time for awards, Hollywood will shun it for fear that support will cause them to ""never work in this town again.""

My tears flowed throughout the entire movie. I think Mel Gibson did an excellent job in portraying the sufferings of Christ so well.   I hope this movie will move many viewers to pick up their bibles and start reading them.  I hope and pray other Hollywood movie directors/producers will start making more Bible-related movies and much less of the trash, sex, violence and filth we currently see.

1915,the_dwelling_place,An Awful Portrayal of a non-biblical Christ and His passion,1,26 March 2004,"This was a horrible film.  A complete sham of the Gospel. If it was anything it was Roman Catholic propaganda.This film was horrific for it's widespread acceptance within the evangelical Christian community.  Gibson is an avowed RC and this was the more RC portrait of Christ ever conveyed in the history of cinama.  He did the work of the RC church and the Pope without regard for the Bible and what the Bible reveals about Christ.  Evangelical Christians have revealed just how much they do not know or understand ""Christ"" and how this film blasphemes and belittles who He is.While deeply moved by the portrayal and acting of the cast, I could not help but see the Catholic imagery and the subtlety of the message being conveyed in the film.Jesus Christ did not die due to a plot by the religious leaders of the Judean community or by the hands of the Romans.  He died as a willing sacrifice and suffered the wrath of God for the sins of the world.  The Romans may have tortured, beaten and executed him, and the Judean leaders may have plotted His death, but it was because of the wrath of God being poured out upon Christ as a sin offering, for which He died. The film did not portray that.  He was innocent, and a willing sacrifice for humanity.The movie made it seem to be about love and forgiveness of those who persecute the innocent.  That is NOT the gospel message.  It is about the wrath of God being appeased by the sacrifice of one man who is without sin, on behalf of a humanity in need of a way to wholeness and completeness and a restored relationship with God.",The Passion of the Christ
1916,shivadancer,Profoundly inspiring... because it's our story,10,20 June 2004,"Unfortunately the debate surrounding this movie will likely rage on for years to come and ultimately obscure what really matters. Whether ""The Passion"" is historically accurate, religiously biased, or exceedingly violent is simply not the point. What's the point is the fact that this film touches the core of our own humanity, and it does so for a reason... because its message is universal, it's beyond religion, beyond politics, beyond sectarianism... beyond debate.What I loved most about Gibson's treatment of the Crucifixion was the fact that he captured the essence of the hero myth (i.e. Joseph Campbell). And in this sense it goes beyond the mind to reach the heart. As human beings, our deepest yearning is to be inspired. And this film delivers.Another aspect of the film's brilliance is how refreshingly intimate it is. How many of us went to church as kids only to be bored to death by one dull sermon after another. Christ, Mary, the Apostles, were always kept on some unreachable pedestal. Here, their humanity speaks to all of us.If there is one criticism, I felt the Resurrection was understated to the point of weakness. I know it's a difficult subject to handle and you have to end a movie somewhere, but given the superb handling of all other aspects of the film, I wish Mel had taken this challenge on as well. Unfortunately, a civilization that dwells on violence will inevitably reap mega-violence. The history of Israel certainly speaks to that, and recent events in the West point more and more in this direction. The archetype of the Resurrection is vital if we are going to move beyond this delusion as a civilization.",The Passion of the Christ

I had considered myself a devout Christian before the film but seeing what my Lord suffered for my sins, and the sins of the ENTIRE world changed my life, forever, for the best. It was a painful reminder that I needed to see. Many of us (Christians) get comfortable with life and tend to forget the price paid for our salvation. I knew the Scriptures well but the impact of seeing it depicted was like a badly needed wake-up call for me. It's too bad that so many people have such negative thoughts on the film. Many of the comments are on the verge of anger and hate. These people missed the whole point of the film. Jesus was right; His sheep would hear and know His his voice and follow Him.

Jim Cavezel looks so much like every picture I have ever seen of the Lord,  when he is teaching the desiples in some of the scenes, his beautiful face, I think that's one of the things that made it so powerful to me. I love the way he handled Mary, the love of Mother for child,  I love the way he handled Judas, giving him a human side,  In particuliar I thought the way the devil was in the entire movie trying to disrupt Gods plans right to the very end, you cant believe in God and not the devil, they are together,  how can you have a movie about a angry mob ,a beating, a cruxifiction, and not have i violent, thanks Mel Gibson, for bringing something so dear to my heart, to life for me.",The Passion of the Christ

While the intensity of its violence is great, the message it conveys is an attempt to be true to the gospels.  I would take this film as a statement of faith.  While different faith groups will see different facets of this film and its depiction of Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection, I came away from this film (twice seen, now) with an even stronger conviction of my faith, and my call as a pastor.  While the movie may be offensive to some, either due to the level of violence, or differences in religious faith, I do not believe that the movie was intended to offend other religious faith groups.  It appears to me that the movie is a personal statement made by Mr. Gibson about his own faith in Jesus Christ, based on his own life's journey, and how the gospels and Christ have affected him.This pastor says, ""Well done, Mr. Gibson""",The Passion of the Christ

The scenes will haunt you for the rest of your life making you think about the meaning of life.Complaining about inaccuracies is not a relevant argument in evaluating the film, since a movie has to show specifics not mentioned anywhere in the original scriptures. plus some unavoidable creative license (like the not-very-relevant `tall table' excuse to show the family life)Aramaic and Latin?

It made me feel thankful and to value that great sacrifice that somebody did consciously for all of us. Definitively a memorable film and that all human being must see.

1929,psyou2,Message of Love,10,3 April 2004,"I found the movie incredibly moving and thought provoking. I cried the whole way through and did not miss a frame. My summation is that above all it is a story of love. and I think that what I got out of it is that after 2000 years we have lost sight of the simplicity of Christ's message, which was and IS: 'Love one another, as I have loved you'. I think that over the past two millennia men have exercised their 'so called intellects' in mind games and semantic exercises, which have taken them away from this simple message. I think that it is a typical human endeavour into the game of making themselves powerful, if not in physical strength then in intellectual power.Someone said to me that 'it was a woman's film' and I can understand how someone would be mistaken in thinking that because the relationship between the Mother and Son is so powerful however the reverse side is that as a man I am able to appreciate the relationship between Son and Mother, which was also beautifully scripted. And of course, on a personal note, I found so very moving the portrayal of Christ's last act to take care of his Mother. I did not find the violence gratuitous. It has made me realise, once again, what we men are capable of doing to each other, and it has made me realise how whitewashed has been my own private contemplation of Christ's suffering. I did not see anything anti Semitic, in fact I saw myself in the faces of His accusers, I saw my sins tearing at the flesh of Christ. I loved the little touches of humanity: Mary dropping what She was doing and rushing to pick up the fallen Christ child; then the wonderful incident where Christ as a young man is making a table which according to the 'times' would have been too high to eat from and Christ tells His Mother that He will make tall chairs to go with it and she replies 'it will never catch on'. Apart from Christ and the Cyprian, women are definitely the strong characters in the telling: Mary the Mother, Magdalene the support, Claudia, Pontius Pilots wife who senses more than she understands and Veronica who I believe is each of us. I think that Mel Gibson in his telling of the Passion is reminding us that we need to get back to the essence of Christ's message of LOVE.",The Passion of the Christ

Christ's suffering was so intense and it made me realize that with every sin I commit, it is already payed with evry wound he endured to save you and me. The only thing that separates us from God right now is our pride and lack of repentance. I also came to the realization that I am a million times blessed to have been born this century. Because if I were there at that time, Im not sure if I would have believed Jesus,too. Imagine, even Peter,denied Him, how much more for me? How sure could we be that we wouldn't be one of those who spit, threw stones and persecuted Him? Truly, I prayed a million thanks and praise to Him after the watching the movie. I continue to promote this film to other people in hope that it would touch thier hearts the way it touched mine and bring them back into the light of Christ the way it has enlightened me.

I can't speak for others, however, I know it made me ponder my own life, and it changed me forever. It's a must see. I just seen this movie tonight and it blew me away.I did notice during the movie that a couple of people left early. This is with out a doubt the wrong thing to do. You MUST see the WHOLE movie.

I have never gone to a movie where there were people crying from the very beginning. You could smell the sweat of the people during the wipping scene.  Anyone who says that it was the most violent movie ever is truly mistaken.  Since when is this country worried about violence in movies.

This is a movie that I feel will change many ideas of who Christ really is and the suffering and love of one man to prove His love for all men. It is so well done that it stays in your heart and mind long after you have seen the movie.

The subtitles made me wonder whether or not I could enjoy the movie, but I soon discovered that this was not a movie to be enjoyed, but one that was experienced.  Though the brutality by some may have seemed extreme and uncalled for, as we all must be reminded at times, the torture and death of Christ was extreme.  I applaud Mel Gibson for taking such a leap of faith and risk career suicide to bring his labor of love to theaters.

He persevered with his own money and sweat along with the dedication of a faithful cast and crew to produce this movie.  God stepped in, and through the innate universal desire all persons have to know God, people came to this movie in record numbers.What Jesus did for us all should not only be told, but shouted from every mountain top.How undeserving, any of us are, of Christ and His accomplishment upon Calvary now freely offered to us all.How fortunate man is that salvation is there for any who will accept, believe, and receive it.""Why should I be silent or ashamed to speak about the One Who took my place.""

1941,stephaniemilhoan,See it!!,10,9 April 2004,"I saw the movie last night.  Thought it would be the perfect Maundy Thursday ""Holy Thursday"" activity.  Holy Thursday activities usually commemorate the Thursday before the Crucifixion - Jesus' last Passover meal and the institution of communion on this night, the washing of the feet, Jesus' suffering in Gethsemane and Judas' betrayal. Pretty much the beginning of the movie.  With the majority of the movie then chronicling the events of Good Friday - the arrest, the crucifixion and suffering, death, and burial.
Wow.  My eyes are puffy and swollen and my body drained from having cried, often sobbed, all the way through.  I hadn't expected to react as I did and as I have.  But then I've never been able to watch depictions of violence and injustice and abuse of innocents easily.  And this is all of that happening to Jesus, to God himself.  The greatest story ever told...
If you haven't seen it I encourage you to do so.  No, it isn't entirely ""scripturally accurate"" in that there are dramatic interpretations and inclusions that could have happened or make sense or are meant to be metaphorically poignant (Satan's appearances through the movie) but that are not specifically chronicled in the Bible.  It is a 2 hour movie trying to depict a relatively short group of chapters detailing events that took place over multiple days.  That requires some necessary extrapolation.  We weren't there.  We don't know exactly how it all happened.  I appreciated this effort as much, no significantly more, than any preacher's attempt to relay to me and get me to reflect on the events and the scriptural passages.  This effort quite literally allowed me to SEE it.  Not exactly as it happened.  But a very Biblically based account that left me with truer understandings and appreciation then I had previously.Very powerful!  Incredible acting.  Especially of Jesus and Satan. See this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
1942,gcat294,"Not anti-Semitic, but a great movie",10,9 April 2004,"Best movie I've seen on Jesus. Allegation of anti Semitic was an attempt to smear the movie. You had several Jewish characters defending Jesus in this movie, and the ones who actually looked the worse were the Romans who whipped him. As for it being violent, nonsense. It would be better to say the movie is graphic. I don't remember these critics being outraged over the Godfather movies, they instead praised it. So violence is just another attempt to taint this movie. Also to address the violence, give me a break. In Isaiah 52:14, it reads ""...his visage was so marred more than any man..."" If Mel Gibson had actually did this in the movie, Jim Caviezel would be unrecognizable. So Mel Gibson actually toned it down for this movie.
Again, great movie, and I'm not saying it because I'm a Christian; more so because it comes the closest to scripture of any movie of Jesus I've seen, and the scenes that were very emotional, especially for a guy like me.",The Passion of the Christ
1943,abigailolivar,2 person review of The Passion of the Christ,9,9 April 2012,"P.O.V. of Paolo:The film just hits you. While I was watching it today I myself got emotional and some of the stuff is just downright hard to watch but it is the BEST rendition of what Jesus went through in those times. At a film standpoint it was beautifully shot and whoever was the D.P. (Director of Photography) is brilliant and the amazing musical score really set the tone. And oh yeah KUDOS to Jim Caviezel as well for an outstanding performance as Jesus Christ. P.O.V. of Abby:Mel Gibson really knows how to hit the hearts of the viewers who ware watching this movie. It was the right choice for the movie to be in Aramaic/Hebrew, it made me think we we're actually there on that day when Jesus went through the pain and suffering for the last 12 hours of his reign on earth. If it we're in English I don't think the movie would have been that successful, I'm glad Gibson decided to add in English Subtitles instead.By watching this movie it has made me understand Jesus Christ more, what he willingly put himself through for his enemies, followers and loved ones so when they die they will journey on to heaven and be forgiven for their sins. It;s the best adaptation of Jesus Christ's last moments on earth. I'm proud to have completed the sacraments to being a fully initiated catholic this year and I feel much more closer to Christ when I take the body of Christ and the blood of life. And the movie itself is really gruesome and I believe honest, Gibson is quite a talented director, for this movie to be his directorial debut I wouldn't have thought it was, he made it seem like he's been directing films for ages.I give KUDOS for this film, I got really emotional in all the right scenes, The Passion of the Christ hit me hard, I'd re-watch this film again and again because what is being depicted on the screen its in the holy bible and whenever we read scripture from the bible in church we read the same scriptures over again each and every year and its fascinating because somehow the meaning of the scripture changes year after year. It's possible the same thing can happen in this film adaptation in my opinion.For people like me who didn't quite understand what Jesus Christ was all about and want to be one of his sheep should really consider watching The Passion of The Christ.",The Passion of the Christ
1944,cheshiremk,Mr. Gibson has produced a clinker.,2,15 April 2004,"The Passion was one of the greater disappointments in my recent film-going experience.From all I had heard about Mel Gibson's take on The Passion, it did not appear to be the kind of film one `enjoys.' Rather I expected to be moved by it; to somehow come away with a more real, more personal, perhaps even more profound and meaningful, understanding of how and why Christ died for our sins. And I was fully prepared to exit an emotional basket case.No less than Paul Harvey called it `a masterpiece of film-making and an artistic triumph.' I would love to hear `the rest of the story' on that one, Mr. Harvey.The ham-fisted direction in the opening scenes in the Garden of Gethsemane robs the actors of whatever talent they may have had. The disciples spend most of their time looking off camera, as if pleading for direction. Unfortunately, as it turns out, their pleas were answered.And, for me, it went down hill from there, the poor direction creating an artificiality that, for me, totally obscured the message I had hoped to get.The devil, not so subtly introduced in the Garden and reappearing during the Passion, is allowed to have but one expression, that of vacant eyed, haunting observer. But, to be fair, Mary, Mother of Jesus, is saddled with a similar facial paralysis, that of unrelieved anguish. Anguish, yes. But, of unrelieved intensity?Pilate's chief centurion is given more swinging room. His expression varies from stern command to stern befuddlement.The sadistic, gleeful pleasure so evident in the blood spattered faces of the scourgers is over the top, as is the sado-masochistic over concentration on the sadistic scourging itself. Perhaps if that all important suspension of belief were achieved.but, not in this context.While some of the cinematography is indeed remarkable, the over use of slow motion goes far beyond making the point, to rapidly benumbing this viewer.I was told I would be moved by this film. And I was. I was moved to acknowledge the power - and the danger -- of hype.Mr. Gibson has produced a clinker.

This film gave me just a glimpse of how much Jesus loves me and all of us!  Seeing and receiving from this film has changed my life in  wonderful ways; Jesus willingly endured all the pain, suffering, and went to the cross because He saw value and worth in me - that very concept is so amazing that I have no words to express it.  I have told numerous people they should go see it, but to bring kleenex instead of popcorn and soda.  I pray that God richly blesses everyone who worked on this remarkable film.

After watching graphic news and seeing video's that promote sex and vio-lence in the world, I find that the difference with this movie is simply that the we know the person who is being tortured. It is personal and I don't believe the director could have brought the reality of this tragedy to us in any other way.  I enjoyed it and so did every person that I knew personally, who had seen the picture.  Even persons, with cognitive impairments, could relate and understand.

1950,afobisme,why i think this film is not a film,3,12 April 2004,"why? because there is no drama. This ""film"" is more like a re-enactment. It's 2 hours of Jesus getting beaten into a pulp. It does little to explain how Jesus got there, and the stories behind the other characters (if there were any). I respect other people's opinions, but I don't know why this film got such a high rating (7.5 is about 4 more points than I would give it). IT'S JUST TWO HOURS OF JESUS GETTING BEATEN should have been the title.
I watch movies for the plot/drama/action, not the gore. Yeah, sure it was interesting to see the way Jesus was unfairly beaten in this film (and the sufferings he had to sacrifice), but after 20 minutes of it, I began to think to myself ""is this it? there aren't going to be any flashbacks or twists or ANY content other than gore?""",The Passion of the Christ

Bearing this in mind, one of the most bloody scenes is transformed into an act of eternal sacrifice. My gratitude and respect are eternally for Him.

Although every one may not realize who each character is in the movie, the point is made clear about how Christ suffered for all of us. The title to me couldn't have been any better. You clearly feel the passion Christ has and the passion others had and still have for him. It's been over 16 hours since I've seen the film and I'm still moved by it and know that is has made a difference in my life for the better.

I particularly liked how good and evil were illustrated throughout the movie. It truly showed that WE are all sinners who ""helped"" drive those nails into Jesus' hands and feet..NOT one ethnic group or another. I could see that this movie might upset the faint of heart, but for those who are not afraid to witness how Jesus was treated so brutally(and this is historical fact..even with the artistic license that Gibson took with reading the visionaries books and using that material too) this movie really touches your heart and makes you think.

1956,deovolente777,Life changing. That's why there is a tension of opinions.,10,13 April 2004,"I really do pity all those who find a need to make Mel Gibson into some kind of twisted person.  Why go there?  He told a story to bring attention to the subject, not himself.  This is what the overly critical types avoid talking about, the story of Jesus himself.  Franco Zeffirelli did a different kind of story.  He was trying to tell the whole story.  By now most people in the civilized world know the whole story, there isn't a great need to tell it all again.  Mel has satisfied the complaint that every Christian has about these type of films, the suffering Jesus hardly has a scratch on Him, the suffering Jesus is just too pretty.  These were unrealistic portrayals of what really happened to Jesus according to what the bible says. Finally we have a portrayal that depicts it as it was.  I am not a Catholic but have to agree with the Pope' s opinion, ""It is as it was.""  In a generation where violence and super realism is portrayed on the screen daily, where we are fed a consistent diet of blood and violence from Hollywood, one would think that the audience would eat this up.  But because we aren't glorifying a drug addict, dealer, prostitute, mobster or other criminal type, there is a angry group who find it too violent.  Shall we go back to the pretty Jesus, who simply does not exist?  I should hope not.  It is a film that is contemporary to it's violence-fed audiences.  It is a story that asks you to consider it's truth.  This is where all the anger lies.  It is a picture of pain, and it is in His choosing of the pain rather than opting out of it, that the outrageous love of the Savior is portrayed for the hopeless world. It is the love story of love stories. Great job, Mel, keep them coming.",The Passion of the Christ
1957,libyab,The Best Depiction Ever,10,13 April 2004,"Mel Gibson gave an accurate depiction of the Gospels in regards to the last hours and crucifixion of Christ. No one has ever been able to capture this crucial and emotional moment before. The portrayal of Jesus and the condition of his spirit was amazing. The unblemished depiction of a crucifixion at that time was extraordinary. The sacrifice and suffering of Christ was made personally evident to the viewer, whether brutal or blessing. One this is for sure, one would never look at the last hours of Jesus the same. The intent of the movie was completed and God is surely smiling. We concentrate so much on the resurrection, but forget what it took to get to that point. We over look the nails, the blood, the crown of thorns, and the tormenting of Jesus. We forget about those things and rejoice in the resurrection. There was a cause before the effect; and that cause was the sacrificial death of Christ. With out the crucifixion there wouldn't be a resurrection. The story is not about who killed Jesus for He chose to lay down his life as a ransom for many. The story of Jesus will always bring controversy. It always has. But nevertheless, this movie achieved one great thing, getting people to talk about Jesus.

Mel Gibson's movie has touched multiplied millions and will continue to do so until Christ returns again back to this earth.

The movie doesn't even come close to what suffering and beatings that our Lord took those last few hours, because we could not bare to see it! AS it was, it was enough for me to know, that HE died for me, and suffered so I could live eternally. I stayed after the film was over, and wept, just wept..The experience that took place was a visual for me, one that is a mirror to the word of God. To place both side by side, rounded out what happened to Jesus, and allowed me to be ""there"" in a sense. I guess, that is what got me most.

It made the story of the cross ""real"" to me. The scourging Christ took from the cat of nine tails from Pontius Pilate's soldiers gripped my heart and I could no longer hold the tears back. It seemed as though the soldiers were never going to stop and yet Jesus took beating after beating without a response. The reality of Christ going through this cruel death showed his love for us. He had the power to escape the Roman soldiers, to come off the cross, and not die, but he chose the path of pain and suffering because it was the only way to satisfy the payment of sin.

It is truly unique as the story is told by the witness to faith. The bare fact of being such a witness does not allow half-truths or false compromises and the movie reflects that brilliantly. If we want to make somebody feel good about it, let it be God Himself. That is it! After all, we are only passers-by on the face of this earth... Secondly, it is truly unique as virtually every Hollywood production is hostile as well as offensive towards Christian message. That can be easily seen whenever, the story made in Hollywood, refers to Christian faith or more specifically to Catholic faith. Thus ""The Passion of the Christ"" is like an invigorating fresh air after all those mindless Hollywood productions polluted with hatred. That is why it has been embraced by the audience worldwide.

I was in tears at the end of the movie, that's only because I know what happened before those 12 days... and after  !!! This movie shows us the passion that Christ had for our soul. He gave His all for us that we may live. One ""man"" took the sin of the world. An amazing feat that no one can repeat. The film does not tell the whole story... I just hope Mel Gibson will produce a sequel of a passionate Christ, He lived, Died and Rose again like none other. He lived a life of passion for us. A prequel will show the world that He is truly the SON OF GOD !I would like to see a prequel to this amazing movie !!",The Passion of the Christ
1964,nonnybird,A Compelling Experience,10,18 April 2004,"This movie is a definite must-see.  If you haven't seen it than your absolutely crazy, because even if your not Christian its an interesting and powerful movie.  The directing, music, acting, storyline, EVERYTHING is perfect.  The only flaw is the excessive violence, however I can understand why there is so much because of the barbarious behavior of people back then. Should Mel Gibson see this review, Mr. Gibson, BRAVO!  This movie is an absolute masterpiece!  You have shown us that some risks in life are good risks, and this movie was a definite risk.  For those who think that this movie is Anti-Semitic, you really have to see this movie for yourself before you judge it.  It's unfair how you judge the movie before even viewing it for yourself, and for your information the movie is not to put the Semitic people in a bad light, but to show what Jesus had to go through for our sins, so stop making it your problem!  And if it bothers you that much than don't see it but stop complaining!",The Passion of the Christ
1965,lesac,Stark truisum,10,19 April 2004,"The film gripped the entire audience from the first minutes. The entire audience remained still and quite as they viewed the compelling drama. This film certainly depicts Jesus' trials as a human, what he had to have felt, how hard it was physically, mentally and emotionally. And I appreciated the depiction to include His enemy or adversary, always present, waiting for the man Jesus to weaken and turn his back on his Father and the task for which he came. The Ministarial Alliance in Mason, Texas paid for The Passion to run five days, free to the public. Every showing has been packed in the renovated theater built in 1928. Thank you Mel Gibson for making this must-see film.  The two hours and ten minutes passed without notice.  At the end, the lights went on too quickly, everyone quietly arose from their seats and made their way to the front exit. One friend greeted me with a touch, but no words were spoken. How could one speak after veiwing this incredible reality. You must take time, after seeing The Passion, to be alone and quiet and obsorb what one just viewed. This film should help us all to know how much love it took for the Father to give his son's life and how much love it took for the Son to carry out the sacrifice. I can't imagine another film on the subject ever being made. This film will always be with us and should be viewed at least once a year by all. Outstanding film making, incredible acting, I can't say enough. Thank you. Mason, Texas",The Passion of the Christ
1966,Stuka-mit-Kreuz,It's brutally real,10,17 May 2004,"We all read the bible, or at least know the story of Christ, and now honestly, WHAT DI YOU EXPECT? In the other movies, after the whipping, Christ barely had 3 stripes on his back, he was hardly ""touched"" by the roman soldiers, everybody treated him so nice, and yet they crucified him. But they were all his friends, suffering to the minimum, or what?! I think we all got so used to this view of Christ's last hours, that we forgot that he actually suffered, that he was actually beaten, whipped and crucified. He saved us through his suffering, and that suffering must have been great, or any other man who happened to be ""spanked"" a little by the romans could have claimed the salvation of human kind... This film reminds us, or better yet, lets us know, of the suffering of Christ. Others couldn't stand the cruel scenes, so they left. Unfortunately, Christ couldn't just leave the scene, and say: this is just too much!",The Passion of the Christ
1967,ekacar,Achievement First! 8.5/10,8,20 April 2004,"As a Muslim many thought I would watch this film with prejudice and hatred. However, the film I watched was at first a piece of art therefore it should have been considered as one. The reason I like this film -and beyond this one all the films- is that I appreciate achievement. Mel Gibson's intention was to form the vision of Christ in his mind for the whole audience and he completely succeeds in his struggle. In addition, the cast, the make-up team and the cinematographer have done wonderful works which were worth appreciation.Therefore before all the prejudice in your hearts or minds you should as well take this film as an artistic piece and make your comments on it regarding this fact. My voting criteria is mostly based on appreciation(%20) and personal efforts(%20).(I guess that's why I tend to like all the movies I had watched except one) and this movie gets 7/8 for achievement and 1.5/2 for personal efforts therefore the overall rating is 8.5/10.",The Passion of the Christ

1969,edward-andrews,A seriously bad film,1,25 April 2004,"This is a seriously bad film. Of course I had read the publicity, and the reviews. I had looked at the comments about the Anti Semitism.Is it Anti-Semitic? I don't know. I'm not Jewish. If I look down the tunnel the other way, did I feel that I had to respond negatively to the Jews. Well I didn't, but that's just me. Actually I found the film obscene. If you are into sado-machism, then it might have worked. Yes, I know the Gospel story,  I have it in Parallel before me as I write, with John separate for that is how it is. It would be long winded if we looked at all the errors in the story. There are the technical ones. The whips of the soldiers on the way to the cross did not seem to pick up the blood. There are however the times when he simply gets the Gospel story wrong. One of my favourite stories is the Marchan Colon. The event which is only described in Mark where the young man ran away naked(Mk 14:51). Well he didn't in the film. Again the whole point of the soldiers playing dice was John 19:23& 24. That they did not want to destroy the Robe of Jesus. However to allow for the violence of Gibson they simply tore the Robe before they Crucified him. There were then the technical problems. It is generally accepted that the Cross which the Condemned person carried was the beam. The uprights were there already. Now Crucifixion worked by the condemned having to pull themselves up however the people on the cross hung without movement. If they did that they were dead already. We had the incredible brutality of the floggings any yet Gibson chickened out on the details of the CrucifixionFinally there were the theological errors. We had some figure who had a maggot coming down his nostril. He produced a snake - but there aren't pythons in Palestine. What was his role? He kept cropping up. I can't find him in the Bible. Neither can I find St Veronica, but we'll let that go. In that tradition Jesus only fell three times. The centrepiece of the film seemed to be the flogging. However in its context Jesus was originally chastised by Pilate (Luke 23:16). That is the beating with sticks. The Flogging was only administered after the condemnation to death.I was interested to see Mary and perhaps Mary Magdalene in the Courtyard. The Bible doesn't seem to place them there. I could go on with the Biblical mistakes. Ultimately they get things really wrong. In the Resurrection we see a spiritual one. Not a physical one. (and the Veil for the face didn't end up separate from the rest John 20: 7) Of course, for those who want anatomical aids to devotion, and who belong to the Roman idea of the Crucifixion where the suffering is all it might work. However for those who believe in Christus Victor. Who believe that the passion was where Jesus genuinely took our sins, but also demonstrated God's eternal love for us it simply fails. I am extremely worried about a lot of people getting the wrong end of the Christian stick about this film. There is of course the famous piece of propaganda about everyone seeing the film in a Washington Cinema being changed. I don't believe that story. There is an extremely long set of titles and quite a proportion of the audience left during them. What would my advice be? I couldn't in all honesty recommend the Film to anyone. There are too many mistakes. The seeming Theology is too bad.  Too many places where we must presume Gibson put his own idea. Of course there will be those who will push it. that is their risk. I think that like so much it simply hasn't travelled the Atlantic satisfactorily. It might work in a community which was basically Roman Catholic, or in some Protestant sects. Certainly I don't see it working generally in Scotland. Edward",The Passion of the Christ

I hope you go on to make even more money. It's ok for hollywood to make millions off trash, so make your millions off your convictions. You will be put down for it, and you will be put down for anything that involves the real Saviour. Nobody has a problem with violence, as they claim. Hmm, let's see, Kill Bill 2, Hellboy, and the Punisher, etc, all violent. Nobody is saying anything about these movies. They don't have a problem with violence, they have a problem with Jesus.

I would venture to say that one of the benefits of this film is to bring all to the knowledge of God and His Son so that on the day of judgment we will not be able to plead ignorance.Hopefully many will convert to the One True Faith, outside of which there is no salvation but unfortunately Jesus stated that broad is the path to destruction.To Jesus Through Mary,Tradosaurus",The Passion of the Christ
1973,panettonea,Intense and Unsettling,10,3 May 2004,"This was a powerful, memorable film.  Throughout the whole movie, there was a current of unsettling tension.  There were so many things to like about the movie.  Even if you care nothing about religion, this movie was poignant and gripping.  I think it did an excellent job of portraying what Christ went through.  There were even some interesting, spooky additions on top of what is actually described in the Gospels, such as a crow pecking out one of the crucified prisoner's eyes.  The flashbacks were very effective as well, as various characters remembered key scenes in their lives as they witnessed the impending crucifixion.  The actors all did excellent jobs. I just saw this last night, and already I want to go see it again.  I highly recommend this movie.",The Passion of the Christ
1974,lauraleland,Comments on historical accuracy,10,4 May 2004,"I ahve heard the detractors of this film comment on its Biblical and historical accuracy.  To this I give a resounding:Poppycock!As a student of the Bible (I am a Master of Divinity student at Grace University in Omaha), the items most noted for inaccuracy, i.e. the serpent in the garden of Eden (comes from Genesis ~ the serpent crushed under heel) and the soldier striking Christ and Christ standing up to him (comes from the Apocrypha) are but a couple.  Some conjecture, i.e., Judas hanging or jumping fromthe cliff was brilliant in its delivery.Sounds to me as if Satan doesn't want God on his turf (Hollywood).Too bad.",The Passion of the Christ
1975,tchnprch,A personal reaction to this lasting impression,10,6 May 2004,"Honesty and reality are not always the same. They are rarely ""pretty."" To truly have empathy -even sympathy- for others and their viewpoints, it is necessary to see and know the depth of their experience. Regardless of our personal religious or non-religious persuasion, to see the extreme sacrifice made on behalf of others will leave us with respect for the convictions of the Christ. Not for the conviction of him.Jerusalem of 2000 years ago was not incredibly ""civilized."" Dramatic as it may seem in the movie, this -heat(and cold), hunger, disease, filth, overcrowding, mob menatalities run amuck, ""might is right,"" rule by intimidation, torture and murder- was the everyday norm in Roman-occupied territories. With the present day's overflow of violence and killing in the entertainment industry we have become jaded and unmoved by  the presence of death in the news. Many in our society are distanced from most real painful situations. There seems to be a lacking on our part of a true appreciation of the utmost sacrifice.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST shows us a very un-pretty reality and truth. It does so by getting through and beyond our calloused mindsets and emotions. We feel and cringe and are repulsed. We are disgusted. We even cry. We are almost frightened by the sadistic nature of some in the film - personality traits that transcend race, gender, ethnicity and religion. We are outraged, incensed and utterly shocked that such a brutal injustice could be carried out.Because of the imagery, we feel emotion. Emotion is neither inherently good nor bad. What we do with the emotion raised within us by viewing this film is where moral judgments come in. We do not merely watch or view this film, but rather we experience it.Reading the script helps keep us focused since there is only minimal conversation - only basic, necessary speech. With our eyes fixed on the screen for fear of missing a line, we miss no images. What a neat tool to use.The ultimate sadness is that life has always been largely political in this world. It continues to be so and I suspect it will always be. There was very little about religion in the movie. It showed how trying to keep control of power was a major concern, with parameters that went beyond common decency or respect. Graphic violence to be sure, but there was no other way to accurately portray the world of twenty centuries ago. Not a film for children and young adolescents. How fortunate we live in a society -unlike many in our contemporary world- different from Jesus' Jerusalem where such violence and brutality were un-filterable mainstays of life.I give the film a ""10.""",The Passion of the Christ
1976,giriden,My comments on the film.,10,8 May 2004,"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" was a brilliant movie, for those who know the full story of Jesus Christ as it is recorded in the Bible.For those who do not know that Jesus Christ endured the brutality to save humanity, I would imagine that it was meaningless display of hate and suffering.I think that the popularity of this movie versus other movies about Jesus Christ is that it does not add much to the story that is written in the bible.  The embelishings of the story in past efforts was no doubt the down fall of those movies.Overall your enjoyment of this movie will depend on your previous knowledge of the story of Jesus Christ.  Simply because the character development is limited to what occured in the final hours before Jesus Christ was crucified.~Dude Skywalker~",The Passion of the Christ
1977,dilon,The ultimate show of love,10,11 May 2004,"This is by far the most realistic portrayal of the betrayal, arrest, ""mock trial,"" beating, bearing of the cross, crucifixion, and death of Jesus ever made. Through the years, Jesus' passion has been sanitized; Mel Gibson put aside the sterile passion for what, most probably, happened to Jesus. It wasn't a pretty picture, unlike the movies of the past. Blood actually poured from Jesus' body. It's high time someone showed us!This movie not only showed us what Jesus went through, it also showed us the love He had and has for us all, regardless of religious affiliation or non-affiliation.

1979,bradchodson,An atheist who loved this film wants to know...,8,19 October 2006,"... where the anti-Semitism is? I watched this movie specifically looking for it; I didn't find it. Yes, there are Jews who condemn Jesus. BUT the people in the assembly yelling at Caiphas to free Jesus were Jews. The man who helps him carry the cross was a Jew. The girl who brings him water and wipes his brow was a Jew. The Apostles were Jews. Jesus himself was a Jew. The only truly racist moments I could find are against the ""barabrian"" Romans who are revelling in the brutality they inflict.Saying this film is anti-Semitic is like saying that ""Schindler's List"" is anti-German, or ""Malcolm X"" is anti-white, or ""United 93"" is anti-Arab. Whether you believe in Jesus' divinity or not, the Jewish leaders had religious rebels tortured and killed on a daily basis- this was the nature of their world. You can not claim something that is historically accurate (as in the Jews condemning criminals to death) as racist. You can also not claim that a movie set in a certain area like ancient Isreal is racist for having Jewish villains; if almost every character in the film is Jewish the of course some of the villains will be Jews! So were many of the ""good"" character Jewish! Get over it! It's appearantly okay to be tolerant of every religion in this country except Christianity. That is a horrible double standard, and I find the people crying ""anti-Semitism"" to be hypocrites.Just my opinion.... so don't let the ""anti-Semitism"" crowd dissaude you from seeing this.",The Passion of the Christ

It is painful and sometimes shocking to watch, but it is the most rewarding emotional investment I could ever make. It is but a slice of Christ's reality that is shown. Those without the biblical background to understand that this was God's plan from before the world was created will not understand that the Romans and the Jews were accomplishing that which God willed, and will instead see anti-Semitism.

1982,jcontino,The movie goes beyond and reaches for the human spirit!,10,26 May 2004,"This movie is a master piece on so many levels. No matter what your belief structure is, the movie maker gives you the power to make and draw your own conclusions. Which is so important when something of a spiritual nature is discussed. The movie takes you to the time period as a witness to a gift. The media and critics of the movie see the movie only on the surface, a story of hate and brutality. But, this is a movie of remarkable forgiveness. Without the display of painful sorrow, the message of forgiveness is not potent. The power to forgive strikes at the heart of the power to end violence forever. When faced with so many chances to save himself (not just by that of a God's power), Jesus chooses the path never taken before. A path which has reached so many and touched all who know the story. That true power is in those that love and forgive. The message is clear, the story is powerful, and the movie touches on truth. Even for a non-believer.

1983,vogel210,delicate subject.....,6,13 December 2004,"Mel Gibson hasn't done too badly in point of view screenplay, but the way he presents the subject makes me feel unsure whether what was the real message he wanted to submit. In a way, it seems to me like a little bit of propaganda against jews (me not being Jewish) and it suggests me to hate these people of what they've done to people whose convictions were different to their tradition. Everyone with a clear mind interested in the destiny of the ""Historical Jesus"" knows that during his lifetime that guy was someone that nowadays one would call a terrorist, and we are not able to tell what really happened to him and for what reason he was executed. Did he maybe deserve the pain he had to stand (...always knowing that no one does)??? The truth is, that possibly thousends of people died the same way for similar reasons, and no one remembers of their pains and sorrows. In every war in every periods of time people shed their blood for things they believed in. So what is this movie finally good for ? Well I think ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a highly political movie treating a very delicate subject providing good people and bad people, and all those not believing in the God that Jesus pretended to be the son of, are BAD people. Dear Mel Gibson, with your facilities as a director that I really very appreciate, I am free to express the following suggest: DO MAD MAX IV, as this is a character that is beyond good and bad, and makes you keeping on remaining politically correct, and one will forgive you ""The Passion of Christ"" (At least I will)Whatsoever I have to give it 6 out of 10 for the exciting performance.",The Passion of the Christ

The story goes on, and even if you know the end, it draws you in its everlasting battle and pain. Director made a brilliant effort to make everything authentic and close to truth as possible.

1985,tje6432,"Bring your artistic and/or spiritual inspiration with you, because you won't find it in this film. Bring a barf bag, too, because if the gore doesn't do it, the quality of the film will nauseate you.",1,3 June 2004,"I guess this film is supposed to function as a medieval passion play to terrorize viewers into conversion and/or guilt believers into piety, but it is so (ironically) soul-less that it fails on either account. And it certainly doesn't succeed as a piece of art. This film is outright blasphemous in its failure to contextualize Christ's sacrifice (not to mention in its overt endorsement of vengeance-superhero style! and a few moments of wild and inappropriate creative license). You will not find anything inspiring in this film. However, if the Biblical story is inspiring to you, you may be able to patch together enough allusions and references (though few actual narrative elements) to feel like you saw a theatrical representation of the story and thereby possibly convince yourself that it was spiritually fulfilling. Just don't fall for the trap of thinking you have to find meaning here because of the subject matter. It is not a sin to hate this movie because it is terrible. And it is very terrible.Perhaps the torture scenes are exaggerated as an attempt to show that this crucifixion was special-that it was much more painful and more gruesome than standard executions-in order to emphasize the level of Christ's willing physical suffering, or possibly to translate into a physical demonstration of pain His taking on the sins of the world, each scourge strike symbolizing another sin. But this violent display is not effective precisely because it is so excessive. Soldiers are flat characters (evil incarnate); they are pure sadism, never tiring of inflicting new wounds upon fresh openings. We can easily believe that they are sadistic and enjoy beating and flogging prisoners, that their training encourages this, but it becomes absolutely tedious. We see no evidence of personal animosity for Jesus (unlike with the Pharisees), so as they sweat and grow exhausted from the exertion, we are left to wonder at what purpose they would have for continuing to over-tenderize an already bloody pulp of a body? Wouldn't they feel satisfied with the excessive damage or at least grow bored at some point? I know we did, as an audience.Perhaps because Jesus does not scream in agony, but only winces and bleeds quietly, they have no cue to stop. Regardless, it is exhausting to watch on screen, not simply because it is nauseating and infuriating, but because the gratuitous and horrifying images of soldiers literally slashing and re-slashing flesh to shreds is so over the top that it becomes an incredibly boring motif. This film lacks a narrative thread. Sure, its focus is on the actual crucifixion, but we get a pretty detailed and sympathetic back story for Pontius Pilate, so why not for Jesus, too? Even the disciples are flat characters, following Jesus for no apparent reason. And Mary Magdalene's purpose in the film seems to be to look beautiful while the wind blows her hair off her weeping (but beautiful) face. Satan looks seductive, but doesn't do any seducing, and s/he creeps along without apparent purpose.It's a chore to have to guess and make assumptions based on one's own knowledge of the Bible because the references are so ineffectual in the film. It is offensive and bare, an insult to the beauty of the story, for Christians and non-Christians alike. Repetitive devices abound in this film and cheapen the story. Christ's weariness on the long walk to the Crucifixion is shown in His falling down so many times that it risks becoming--disturbingly--almost darkly comical. And when we do get hints at Biblical allusion (from unsatisfying glimpses of Jesus' private life to trivialized moments of teaching that come through about as powerfully as snippets from inspirational calendars), they are either so cryptic that even a sophisticated audience is likely to need a Bible handy to make the connections or so badly placed in juxtaposition to elements of the film that preach a different message that they are not even effective at pointing to how Jesus was not just some crazy false prophet. The most notable of these terrible moments is Jesus's 'love your enemies' speech, shown in direct contrast to the heavy-handed depiction of sadistic soldiers. To give the film some credit, we do understand that Jesus loves even these monsters, but the film still seems bent on encouraging the audience to reject this doctrine and hate the soldiers (since they are so categorically evil throughout the film). Even the few Roman soldiers who seem inspired by the end do not seem to have a reason for being so (were they simply moved by Jesus's ability to bleed quietly?). A twenty-first-century audience is not only receptive to a good revenge story, but perhaps the filmmakers are unable to avoid making one (which is blasphemy in this case particularly because of Jesus's message to forgive). Vengeance is especially evident in editorialized moments of severe punishment for wicked characters like Judas and the thief on the cross beside Jesus, and when we see Jesus rise from the tomb, looking unmistakably like a superhero, it seems to be moment of culmination for the film's vengeance overtones, rather than anything remotely spiritual. How sadly disappointing. The Christ story is so beautiful, and this film is so ugly. What a let down.",The Passion of the Christ
1986,RickyR,Deeply moving film,10,3 June 2004,"While this movie will have a much deeper impact on a person who is a Christian, in and of itself it brings to life both the suffering and the power of a resurrected Christ.

1987,ludwin,"Well done, but no insight.",1,10 June 2004,"Let's start with the positive: it was nice to hear Jews speaking in Aramaic, and Romans in Latin. And some scenes are very beautiful. I can't deny that this movie is well done.I enjoyed hearing Aramaic language, for the first (and probably last) time in my life. I noted that it is very similar to Arabic (or which I know some words). Modern Hebrew also shares common features with Arabic, but the Accent isn't alike.However, the main purpose of this movie is not to give viewers the opportunity to hear this beautiful language. That's why I didn't take this into account when I voted. I gave this movie a 1 (awful), because it doesn't tell us anything new about that topic.It shows us blood, violence, and suffering, but contains no reflexion at all. A person who never understood Christian teachings will understand less after having seen this movie.Let's take just one example: Paul is said, by Jesus, that he will deny his master ""three times before the cock sings"". Seconds later, Paul just breaks out in tears, and laments because he supposedly betrayed Jesus. But we did not hear Paul saying anything against Jesus!This makes little sense. The movie provides with no analysis, with no new ideas, it just show an awful, bloody execution. It is sadism with a religious excuse. An awful movie!",The Passion of the Christ
1988,Axlsparadise89,The Passion That Lives,10,2 July 2004,"I'm not going to say much but this film,has changed many people into believers, whatever critics say let them go on, but this is a true story and not something about a ring.

And forgiveness, tis a shame the movie isn't at top when all God and Jesus do is put every one of us on Top. I don't really have too much else to say about it. But I just wish more people I care about would see this film and maybe consider their life and the way they act. God and Jesus think about everyone of us and this film shows that. It actually has a meaning and a deep one. Maybe one day we'll all grow up and learn the meaning.",The Passion of the Christ
1989,tabbytalley,Not worth it unless you're religious,2,6 November 2017,"As a agnostic/atheist watching this years after its release, I found it not worth the watch. While it is well shot, with a good soundtrack and acting, the plot ruins it all. It's basically two hours of watching Jesus get tortured. I understand that it's supposed to be true to the bible, but it's just not pleasant to watch. I also found Jesus's fake- looking color contacts very distracting. If you're not religious I would skip it.",The Passion of the Christ
1990,brandstoettner,Some Peoples sight is lost,10,4 September 2004,"(possible give aways if you haven't seen it) OK...I have seen this movie many times. On the big screen and now i own it. Let me start by saying...If you pick up a bible, turn it to mark or john. Read the whole book, You will see the truth. This movie is based on the holy bible. With some things added but if you took the plot it is that of the bible. Now i have heard and read complaints of its brutality. I've heard things like there's nothing ""passionate"" about it. I've heard it been said to be anti-semetic and showing Christs life in a negative way.Well passion. The passion defined in the bible (which is the very same as the title of the movie)means basically what Christ must go through to accomplish his lifes mission. Meaning all the pain sadness and humiliation he must endure. As for anti-semetic. Personally yes it shows the high priest as being corrupt hateful people. It also shows the crowd as being very evil and bloodthirsty. Well if you actually pay attention to the scenes you will see that it shows the guards paying jews(which is in the bible) to yell against Jesus. Now for the depiction of Christs life in a negative way. The movie was very strong with brutal tortures. But do your history folks. Its 2,000 years ago. Do you honestly think that the punishments were gonna be with pillows and feathers. No. Of course the punishment tools were brutal and horrible. 30 lashings from the Romans wasn't a slap on the cheek. The movie showed it exactly as it would have been according to the era and the situation. Another thing to keep in mind is even though this movie is most definitely based on the bible...It is also Mel Gibson's ""vision"" of the passion. Any one of us could write down and picture what Christ's death was like. This was Mels view of the movie which i must say is probably accurate to reality.We must focus on the glory and emotional significance of this film. The acting was simply extraordinary. The story was perfect. The emotion, the anger, the fear, the love, the hate, and the joy. Once we all realize Christ's mission was to die on the cross for our sins. Sorry to all you people who say we should focus on his teachings. Yes they are important. But Christ was born to die.That was his mission. And thats what this movie showed. His death. His mission! ""It is accomplished."" In his own words right there. And my final statement. This movie had sadness,violence,love,heart,emotion,power,and grace. But we cannot forget the beautiful ending. The wonderful feeling.. that Christ stood up.......and he walked out of that tomb, holes in his hand, holes in his feet, and slit in his side. The ending of the film gives you that amazing feeling. Christ has died....Christs has risen....Christ will come again.",The Passion of the Christ
1991,huus-1,The movie is awfully,1,6 July 2004,"I'm not a lay person but a Lutheran reverent. It is totally unnecessary to make it so bloody and cruel. And I have seen that it takes away the real meaning of the gospel, that God let his son die for our sins. And let him resurrect on the third day. Easter is our greatest joy and not the most awful season. I did not want to see the movie to the end so I left the Theater. I find it totally uninteresting, and so did many others in the cinema where we saw it. Whether it claims that the Jews were guilty or not is out of proportion. The Jews at that time wanted him dead, but all os us who are human and sin are the real guilty, so no one can stay outside pointing at somebody that they are the only guilty. But this movie is not the story from the gospel, so don't wast time and money to see it. Niels Ebbe Huus",The Passion of the Christ
1992,kittenz,Tedium of the Christ,1,13 July 2005,"I didn't think it was possible to make a relative interesting story into such a boring depiction. But Mel you did! This is basically a couple of hours of a man being whipped, kicked and beaten. I'm not squeamish, so violence is not my problem (I cut my teeth of Beau Geste at the age of 4), but if you perform the same action over and over and over and over and over again the result is exceptionally dull. There was very little dialog to alleviate the tedium. My other problem was credibility, I know the protagonist is the son of God, but he's in human form. There's no way he could have kept going after the beatings and kickings he received every bone in his body would have been broken. As you may have guessed I don't recommend this film.",The Passion of the Christ
1993,shadowmixer2003,summary is as mandatory read.,6,25 January 2005,"This movie is great all the way around. It tells a great true story that makes you think, great cinematography with absolute perfect shots, plus a moving score. Before going to see this movie i knew there would be a few scenes that would be painful to watch but sadly that's reality and was necessary to accurately tell the story. This Film when you truly think about is as good as it gets. This movie sadly caused controversy when it was released. Many people said that this makes jews look like monsters and that's what spurned Hitler to wipe them out. This truth is many historians have explained through our sins we all killed Christ. It's for people to understand that but by reading the bible they'll be more aware of what I mean. To anybody who will start reading the bible after this commentary read it slowly and with understanding. This film won't be nominated for any golden globes or Academy Awards because usually you've got to do a film about the holocaust or gay pride to have a precise shot at winning those awards.",The Passion of the Christ
1994,sycamoreperez,First time a camera is placed in Jerusalem 2004 years ago,10,17 July 2004,"Mel Gibson has demonstrated not only talent, but also guts and courage. Hundreds may be thousands are afraid to go against the flow in Hollywood. He not only put at risk his personal wealth, but also his professional reputation. He was viciously attacked from every angle. He was rejected and ridicule by his peers and 'friends', and the result of all that madness has been, in my opinion, the best movie of all times.May be the most penetrating, soul transforming film ever produced. I saw the movie 4 times, not only because I like it and found new details and angles I missed before, but also because for the first time, I enjoyed seen the people before and after the movie. It was like an amusement ride, viewers were not the same when they left. Somehow in a very personal way, those images transformed them.When we go to the theater, we all expect in some way, 'more of the same'. It might be shown in a different perspective, with a different and may be original way, but at the end of the day, will be 'more of the same'.The Passion of the Christ broke that routine. It's different, it's violent, but let you filled with gentleness and compassion. It's shocking, but makes you reflect on your own life and experience a new lasting peace. It's fuel with hatred, but also shows you a new kind of love, a Love with capital letter that demands from the lover the ultimate personal sacrifices, your own life, your own blood. It's filled with human suffering, but you leave with a new human solidarity.Yes, it's a weird movie for our times, but I personally believe it's the movie of our times.Alberto R. Perez",The Passion of the Christ
1995,Ashuraya,"Authentic, Original, Memorable - but Lacking?",9,20 August 2004,"I was captivated by Mel Gibson's the Passion of The Christ (""the Passion"") and found it to be original, authentic, and most importantly memorable.Original... I don't think there has been a movie that has portrayed Christ's suffering and sacrifice in such a devoted manner. While other movies about Christ generally place more emphasis on his teachings and actions prior to his crucifixion, those same movies usually fall far too short of depicting the full extent of the suffering Christ willingly endured for humanity in his final hours in Jerusalem. Director Mel Gibson depicted in great detail the full extent of Christ's suffering and I must say that I respect him as a brave director for doing that. Furthermore, I found the use of the Aramaic language brilliant and unprecedented. No other movie on Christ prior to the Passion dared to undertake such a risky - but in the end - successful venture. As such, this movie cannot be called 'another Jesus film'  it is unique and offers something totally new to the viewer.Authentic... I found that the use of the Aramaic language in the film added to its authenticity and helped to immerse the viewer in the environment. I feel Christianity tends to be westernized a great deal in our media and popular culture but I feel the Passion  primarily through its use of Aramaic  has served to counter (somewhat) the westernized character of Christianity and has given people like the Assyrian Christians (who keep Aramaic alive in their churches and homes) something to be proud about. Although I found the use of Aramaic to be the most authenticating factor of the movie, one has to pay tribute to the exceptional costumes, sets, and environments that were brilliantly recreated. Memorable... Authenticity and originality can only take a movie so far and in the end, the Passion did what any good movie should do: it stayed with me long after the movie was over. Unlike other movies that are forgotten minutes after leaving the theatre, the images, sounds, and scenes of the Passion were emotively memorable. Credit also has to be given to acting; Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus and Morgenstern's depiction of Mary were simply stunning. The emotion conveyed by these two terrific actors  even while mute  should earn them both some sort of award or formal recognition.Overall, this movie was authentic, original, and memorable. But some people (even Christians) look down upon this movie because they feel it didn't focus enough on Christ's teachings. I would both agree and disagree. I would agree because this movie was viewed by many non-Christians (especially Muslims and Jews) who may know little about the true Jesus and his teachings; I would disagree because I still feel this film fully portrayed Christ's suffering for humanity, which  until the Passion  was never even attempted. Christ's suffering and ultimate sacrifice, as many know, was important to the validation of his revolutionary teachings. Regardless of what you may think on the issue of the film's 'completeness', I think the movie left enough questions unanswered in the mind of the inquisitive viewer to warrant a sequel (or prequel).Another quality movie by Mel Gibson  I gave it 9 out of 10.",The Passion of the Christ
1996,jakecamara,Misconceptions about the Passion,10,10 August 2004,"Obviously there are some people who are rather ignorant about the words they use and what the Passion of the Christ actually is supposed to be. The one user who said ""There is nothing passionate about this movie"" obviously did not research the meaning of the word Passion. The English word has its roots in the Latin passio, which means, simply, ""suffering.""A search on ""Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary"" turns up:PASSION: \Pas""sion\, v. i. To suffer pain or sorrow; to experience a passion; to be extremely agitated.People also seem upset that this movie did not portray the times in Jesus' life when he was deep in ministry. The Passion of the Christ is a centuries old tradition. I recently visited Oberammergau, Germany and saw the site of the Passion Play that has been performed every decade since 1634. The Passion Play ONLY portrays the suffering of Christ. It is meant to bring the what Christ did for our sins to the forefront.",The Passion of the Christ
1997,lunetics,Jesus is the answer...,10,28 July 2004,"Jesus was a human like you and me, with mortality. He faced the temptations from the devil and the terrible physical pain through all the horrible abuses. Even if he was God He also was human with love and feelings. You can see that from the fantastic retrospect of Jesus and Maria talking and joking at their home. Jesus lived a simple life.The film also shows the deep relationship between them, a mothers feeling for her child. I nearly cried when Jesus looked up from the jail and Maria put her ear against the floor and how they could feel each others presence.On the cross Jesus felt totally left alone because He shout to the Father ""Why do You left me?"" but also shows his enormous Love when He promise the robber to be with Him in heaven. Jesus died on that cross but God discovered Him from the death. On the third day Jesus took the key to the kingdom of death, forever.The Passion Of The Christ is a fantastic movie even if there is much blood in it. But think just a minute. How do you think it really was. Maybe even more brutal!?God Bless!",The Passion of the Christ
1998,Veracity2000,"Low accuracy level of ""The Passion""",3,29 July 2004,"NOTE: The following are rating out of a possible score of 10.CATEGORY: HISTORICAL DRAMAHISTORICAL DRAMA: 8HISTORICAL VERACITY: 2SCREENPLAY BASED ON ORIGINAL TEXTS: 4ACTING BY MALE ACTORS: 7ACTING BY FEMALE ACTORS: 6CINEMATOGRAPHY: 8VIOLENCE: 9NUDITY: 4The weakness of historical dramas in general is the writer's and/or director's tendency to take too much liberty with the historical facts in order to make a commercial product. I tend to rate historical dramas harshly when they stray from the true or add something not there. The main challenge of telling this story is the dearth of original scorce material, so whenever a writer departs from the little that is known, the viewer enters the realm of conjecture and myth making (e.g. JFK as an example of myth making where the historical material available is 100,000 times larger).When Mel Gibson's telling of ""The Passion"" is compared to the relevant chapters in the four synoptic gospels (leaving Thomas aside), there are eight major fictions added to the film not present in any of the four gospel's telling of ""The Passion"". In addition, there are major omissions in the final telling of the story. Here is the list of ""The Passion"" chapters:Matthew (26-28)Mark (14-16)Luke (22-24)John (18-20)Here are the eight major fictions of the movie not present in any of the four synoptic gospels (NOTE: allowing a little leeway in the differences between the four and not looking at other New Testament sources):1. No reference to the Devil in the Garden of Gethsemane2. No reference to Jesus being beaten by those who took him into custody3. No reference to Jesus reattaching the ear of one of his captors4. No reference to temple guards paying citizens to show up as mock crowds against Jesus5. Peter was not inside the temple when he denied Jesus 3 times6. No reference that Jesus was kept in a dungeon in the temple7. No reference to the presence of the Devil at Jesus' scourging8. No reference to the beating and scourging of Jesus through the streets on his way to being crucifiedWorse is the omission of the end of ""The Passion"" story when the four synoptic gospels have very different, and at times contradictory, endings:For example, the movie failed to show the following from the Book of Matthew at the end of The Passion:1. Failed to show that all the tombs opened and the bodies of many holy men rose from the dead, and these, after Jesus' crucifixion, came out of the tombs, entered the city and appeared to a number of people (Matthew 27:52-53).2. Failed to show Joseph of Arimathaea going to Pilate and asking for the body of Jesus, wrapping it in a clean shroud, and placing it in his own newly hewn tomb, and rolling a stone in front (Matthew 27:57-60).3. Failed to show the chief priests asking Pilate to place guards around the tomb to prevent his body being stolen by his followers and then claiming he had arisen from the dead (Matthew 27:62-66).4. Failed to show the angel descending from heaven and moving the stone to reveal and empty tomb to the two Marys (Matthew 28:1-3).Looking at the last chapter of the other three books show variations of these omissions.SUMMARY: Given the four different tellings of ""The Passion"" as a difficult starting point, I believe that Mel Gibson could still have navigated his way to a more faithful telling of this story without the fabrications which only left him open to the criticism of myth making. The movie, however, is a victim of cinematic story telling that sacrifices that accuracy. As a factual historical drama based on historical texts, this movie fails. As an example of modern myth making, it succeeds brilliantly because of the emotive content of the film that plays to the beliefs of the many viewers who will see it.MOVIE: 3MYTH MAKING: 10",The Passion of the Christ

This is the worst film i ever seen, even worse than Gigli. you can't go two minutes with seen either blood or pain to anyone including Mary, and it was very hard trying to know what happens (well we all know what happens at the end) and trying to read the subtitles (not a good speller). But i have to give credit to Mel Gilson who made a mint on this project and it helped with a lot of free help from the newspapers say that it was good or it was bad.

I knew enough about Christianity to know the story and thought it was beautifully filmed, however, the story itself was not ""gripping"" by any means. I understand that the times were barbaric and that Christ was mis-treated. However, I felt like I was watching a drawn-out mildly portrayed snuff film. Paleese - the continual beating, whipping and torture of Christ was not necessary. I suppose there is so little plot to the last 12 hours of his life, Mel Gibson had to concentrate on the abuse that Jesus took to create drama. (The subtitles also got monotonous and I would have been quite happy watching the film in English thank you.)I am certain that deeply religious people will feel that they have been treated to a window opened through a ""time tunnel"" into the last day of their savior. For me - it was a yawner and I won't be in a hurry to watch it again. The hype about this movie WAS NOT justified.One last thing - there was opportunity to create many bonus features on the DVD to highlight the actors and the making of the film.

2003,casbus2,This Movie was Stunning,10,1 September 2004,"This movie was unbelievable.As a Roman Catholic, I have known this story all of my life. Everything in the movie was what I knew from my years of Catholic schooling and Sunday Mass. There was nothing in this movie that I feel was overdone or manipulated by Mel Gibson, as some people have suggested.Even a friend of mine suggested that she wouldn't see the movie because she felt that she'd be subjected to being ""brainwashed"" by Mel Gibson. I'm guessing that she had been taken in by most of the media's slant. It is hilarious how those critics who have praised a film like Pulp Fiction, which is rampant with useless violence, drugs, sex and profanity have panned this film, like once critic called it a ""Gore-fest'? Excuse me? This from someone who has probably praised 'Kill Bill Vol. 1'. Sounds like a double standard to me.This movie has changed my perception of the Passion of Jesus Christ. I've always heard of the sacrifice, but this movie showed it to me. Maybe it could have been a little less violent, because a lot of the faithful Christians out there will be a bit shocked by the violence. But, if you know Mel Gibson and the movies that he has done, you know that he doesn't do things half way. I believe that he wanted the believers of Christ to see what the Passion was really like, unlike previous films that have glossed over it in various ways. Christ was turned over by his peers and the religious leaders of that time. He was scourged and ridiculed by the Romans. He was nailed to the cross and died. The violence in the film was necessary to remind me of the great sacrifice of Jesus. It left an indelible impression on me that has reminded me of why I am a Christian.",The Passion of the Christ

Whether it be someone saying it is discrimination and racist to have a play about Jesus in our schools around Christmas time or people claiming that some religions are evil due to a handful of degenerates that use religion as a unholy reason for their actions. Upon watching Passion, I realized that the Movie wasn't just any old Movie about something historic or biblical. In today's society, media, pop-culture, and television is the place where most people get there information and watch or read things that shape their beliefs. Few people in today's society actually teach us the true facts about things. Michael Savage is one of those few, he tells people how things really are, mostly about political and the environment around us. Mel Gibson is one of those few now. He brings Passion of the Christ to center stage and puts it in the mainstream for people to re-open their eyes to what we slowly forget about. I take my hat off and give a standing ovation to Mel Gibson for doing what truly is important in this day and age, re-educating people's spirits and never forgetting what one man had to go through for the sins of man. Even if your religion or beliefs do not have Jesus in them, there is still a sense of spirtuality and motivation to open your eyes and find hope and faith that there is something far greater inside of us, our Souls.",The Passion of the Christ

I think that there are many hidden meanings in the film and i caught on to several of them which made me enjoy the film even more...i think that his perception of Satan was really well thought of as well.

I am tired of the Politically Correct weaklings out there in society being too weak to see the horrible things that happen or happened in our world. If you want horrible, go to a Middle Eastern country now. Try Iraq where they hack off heads with nothing much more than steak knives. Did Jesus teach that? No!!! Does the Koran teach that to kill an ""Infidel"" is the way to their heaven??? It seems it does from what I hear. What I learned from this is, that I am not worthy of this Savior of mankind's sacrifice. I am a Christian and I love Jesus no doubt. This brought home the reality of what he most likely went through.

I'm really not sure what the point of the movie was other than to capture how vicious and cruel people can be to each other. We only need to turn on the nightly news to see that.

Chronicling the last 12 hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life, the film starts in the garden of Gethsemane were Jesus has gone to pray after the last supper. He is then tempted by Satan and then betrayed by Judas. Arrested on charges of blasphemy by the Pharisees, he is tried then condemn to death and is handed over to the Romans. He is nailed to the cross and guarded there till he dies. The final shot is (this should not be a spoiler) Jesus awakening from death. An Unbelievable performance from Jim Caviezel, Maia Morgenstren(Mary) and the most unforgettable performance by Rosalinda Celentano(Satan). Everyone I know couldn't get the image of her out of their heads for at least a week after watching this film. For authenticity Producer/Director Mel Gibson made the film in all Aramaic with English Subtitles, which wasn't a problem at all. Spectacular cinematography added to the timelessness of this period piece.This is a filmmaker's movie due to the fact that every aspect of film-making in this picture was executed with precision. Allot of people are concerned about the graphic nature of this film but to quote Jack Cafferty of CNN American Morning ""The violence in this movie isn't gratuitous it's real."" What I loved about this movie the most is the way it touched the people afterward in the theatre I saw it in. No one left the theatre with the same attitude they had when they came in, it drastically changed the look on the faces of the people I was with. For A film to have an effect like that just blows my mind. The Passion is the love that Jesus has for man kind that he would go through so much pain so that we could be forgiven for our sins.",The Passion of the Christ
2014,omnipathy,Not a Matter of Religious Principle,8,8 March 2005,"First off... Spoiler?? hmmm, what could I possibly say that hasn't already been said by millions of faithful christians over the last thousand years or so... :)I am an Atheist.This movie contained amazing cinematography, a cast without comparison, a director with vision (albiet somewhat dictated vision), and one of the most inspiring musical scores in cinematic history. The movie was a spectacular voyage through one of the most cliché stories in all of literature.The only problem I had with it was the same problem I have with all cutting edge and controversial religious entertainment...The movie is only the product of it's creator(s).It is fictional because none of the events were witnessed directly by any of the people involved and none of the events were documented with any degree of historical accuracy by any modern standard at all. (Whether these events really took place is always up for debate simply because there exists no possible way outside of time travel to offer any substantial evidence one way or the other.)--The Problem... Easy Money. The controversy surrounding this feature was sure to make it a huge hit grossing countless sums of profit for Mel and all involved. The reason I see this as a problem is because it means that all of the artistic integrity and vision becomes wasted on a film which would have drawn millions simply based on the title and ""anti-semitic"" accusations. I loved this movie and it affected my faith in the same way that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" affected my personal sexual behavior... ...not at all. It's a movie, not a messiah. It is symbolic of the faith of a few creators... not the faith of a people or any individual uninvolved in the creative process.Take a second, and a breath, and watch the movie strictly objectively. It is an inspirational portrayal of a man condemned by his people, betrayed by his friends, and then put to a torturous death by his government. That is all.",The Passion of the Christ
2015,ckling-1,Wonderfully heart wrenching.,10,4 October 2004,"This movie shows just how much Jesus loves us to have gone through all that agonizing suffering just so we could have a chance to go to heaven. You can't fully comprehend by just reading the Bible the extent of the pain and suffering He went through for us. Mel Gibson has done a wonderful job on this movie. Maia Morgenstern who plays Jesus' mother does a wonderful job of showing how much pain she's in watching ""her"" son go through so much pain and suffering. Her eyes pull you into her heart. Luca Lionello who plays Judas also did a wonderful job of making you feel what he was going through.James Caviezel made you feel like you were watching the real Jesus. Rosalind Celentano gave a chilling performance as Satan. I would recommend this movie to just about anyone. I will definitely let my 8-year-old watch this but I wouldn't recommend it for much younger than that.",The Passion of the Christ
2016,t2-10,Very terrific film.,10,26 October 2004,"My hat is off to all those who took part in such an extraordinary film that shows how the love of Christ Jesus is so heavily given to us in the purest form of love, sacrifice. The Holy Spirit truly came upon Mel and he came with boldness and confidence to betray the passion of Jesus Christ in an excellent and spell bound way.To all the cast and crew, very, very well done. You deserve only the best and may the light you carry shine brightly amongst all those you meet. When I went to the movies to see this so many people turned their heads at the scene where Jesus is being beaten. Yes, it is unbearable to watch; yet I asked myself why? and Jim C. was right; we turn our heads because it is our sins that put Christ there. Our sins he bore upon himself that we may have eternal life. Very well done just like the Ten Commandments! Very well done!",The Passion of the Christ

2018,scottaross1,simply sad yet amazing,10,11 October 2004,when i first saw this movie i was sad. this movie has 2 much information like all the blood and stuff its just simply the best movie i have ever seen. i have been a Christan since i was 15 and this movie just made me an even more believer.this movie is very very graphic and well its the best movie that went from a real book to a movie Mel Gibson did an amazing job when he made this movie. i really didn't think he Jesus was put through that much torture when that happened.I didn't really think there was any thing wrong with this movie but i cant help but wonder why its only a 7.5. i gave it a 10/10 easily but still i'm just 1 person. if u don't watch movies or something u must at least see this its utterly amazing. thanks Mel Gibson for making this movie also,The Passion of the Christ
2019,jevdemon,Profoundly moving,10,18 February 2005,"One of the most amazingly inspiring films I've ever seen. There is no anti-semitism in this film - its based on history. The violence is disturbing, but its historically accurate.There are two scenes that you'll never forget: 1) Mary recalling Jesus as a child. This scene will move you to tears. 2) The scene in which Jesus gives up his spirit to the Lord. The camera pulls up hundreds up feet into the air and the scene of Christ on the cross is seen through a raindrop (teardrop?). When the raindrop hits the ground the darkness and earthquakes from Matthew 27:51 are depicted.God bless Mel Gibson for delivering such a wonderful film.",The Passion of the Christ
2020,baronvonmeskel,the long awaited epic film,3,13 October 2004,"I just saw the Passion for the first time. I'll start off with what I appreciated with the film.Major props to Mel in the language department. It is impressive that they entire film is in the appropriate languages (Aramaic, Latin). I think the camera shots of Jesus getting brutally beaten effectively got the message across.Now, I have some major problems with this movie. First off, what's with Satan just walking around with the crowd? Also, I didn't recall Jesus inventing western-style dinner tables in the Bible. Speaking of the Bible, I don't recall earthquakes in the New Testament until Revelations. So, what was going on with the earthquakes when Jesus died? And what's the deal with Judas hallucinating about evil demon-children biting him? And the thing that bugged me was the white Jews in Jerusalem. Think about it, do you see many Israelis that have western European features? I don't. And what's with the Slavic Pilate? It wouldn't be hard to find an actor with Romanesque features. If there was such detail put into the language aspect of the movie to make it accurate, why wasn't there any effort in making sure there was ethnic accuracy also?This movie had the potential to be an amazing piece of work. I've always been fond of Mel's work but I was let down by this film. It seemed to rely too much on the power of the actual events and the message they carried and ended up over stretching its bounds. They were trying hard and wanted this to be a memorable epic film, but it turned out weak. The screen play was weak. Characters were not well set up (you can't just rely on people's prior knowledge of the events to get you through a movie). Themes were not well formulated and were not well carried out.Just because this movie is about something close to your heart doesn't automatically make it a good film. It may move one person because of their faith, but the movie isn't capable of moving a viewer who doesn't have the same faith. The movie caters to the fact that people will be touched simply because of what it is about. Without the power of the crucifixion that took place the movie itself could not stand up on its own. This was a weak movie. I expected so much more and I was let down.",The Passion of the Christ
2021,amanda-cgs,The Passion of the Christ,7,24 March 2013,"This is not a movie to watch after lunch with your family on Sunday. Maybe this is one of the most violent movies of all. Suffering and pain are two words to describe the focus of it. In this context, the word ""passion"" refers to Jesus' suffering and death for us. Therefore, there is no better name for this Gibson's movie. At least 100 minutes of 126 shows all the torture (with really bloody scenes) he suffered. Maybe Gibson's intention is to make us feel completely guilty. With so much bloodshed to pay for our sins, I guess many people felt this way.The Passion of the Christ concentrates on Jesus' last day, with sadistic torture and crucifixion. Jesus (played by James Caviezel) is whipped for a long time and it's not only his suffering that we see: his mother Mary (Maia Morgenstern) and Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) cry in a really painful way during all the film. It seems that Gibson is sadistic in some way. Eighty percent of the movie, at least, is Jesus' suffering, especially by being beaten by people making fun of it. The attention to every detail of Christ's body is really impressive. Sadistic or not, Gibson took care of every single detail in violent scenes.The crucifixion is less bloody, but more painful. Jesus can't even hold the cross, and Simon of Cyrene helps him carrying it. When Jesus dies,an earthquake happens and everybody starts running and screaming.If someone has never heard a bout Christ's story can think that The Passion of the Christ is an action movie from Hollywood.This movie certainly is impressive, not only because of the violent and bloody well done scenes; the roles were all well played. Special attention must be given to Jim Cavieziel that really showed Jesus' agony and pain. The Passion of the Christ shows more than enough how Christ's Passion was: the languages used were Aramaic and Latin. One more point to Gibson.",The Passion of the Christ
2022,saved-1,I think this movie is excellent,10,24 January 2005,"I think that this movie is really good, it's a life changing movie, i know that my life has been changed throw that movie. I have heard that many of my friends lives has been changed too when they have watched this movie. I believe in Jeus but when i saw this movie i really realest how deeper god really loves me. It's not easy to watch but nowadays there is a lot of violence and whatever in our television and movies and when that story is real, it was yet many more horrible so that you can watch it. I think everyone's should watch this! I love Jewish people and i have heard that some Jewish have said it's a antisemitism movie, i think it's not , it was real , that's the way it was, everyone of us was killing Jesus, he really died for our sins, not only because of Jewish wanted him to die, but because of all of us.",The Passion of the Christ
2023,nobody_baby,Superb Illustration of the last 12 hours of Jesus' Life,10,10 November 2004,"This film was most incredible. From the direction, to the acting, every slice of film was superbly mastered. Even for people who don't believe in Jesus, as the son of God, just the acting and direction, alone, was enough to be completely satisfied as a cinematic critic. Mel Gibson was able to find actors that complemented the characters of the bible very well. The felt passion, derived from watching this movie, makes it easier to understand how the movie got its name. The movie definitely deserves an academy award, if not many. Another appeal, that I think contributed to the allure of the movie, was the cast international actors and actresses. For virtually unknown actors to be so magnificent, I feel gave the audience a brief break from ""Hollywood"" royalty.",The Passion of the Christ
2024,henrymlim,John 3:16 on film,10,22 February 2005,"Warning: Contains some revelations which might be spoilers! I'm a Roman Catholic who renewed my faith a year ago. I first saw this film with my church friends. Since then I got myself a (genuine) copy on Video CD and watched it again 4 times, the most recent being last Saturday in my church. My fifth time, but surely not the last time.I totally agree that Mel Gibson has done a fantastic job. The insertion of Jesus' flashbacks throughout the film were almost perfectly timed. It could not be more appropriate to use Aramaic and Latin as the spoken languages in the film.However in my humble opinion, the best feature about the film is the portrayal of the human side of Jesus (before the arrival of the soldiers and Judas Iscariot). Knowing that He was to go through great torture in addition to the crucifixion, He was overwhelmed by fear. Jim Caviezel was superb in acting out the part very realistically. The audience could see the actor's body trembling and voice shaky as he prayed to His Heavenly Father. A very natural human reaction. In the next few scenes involving Satan trying to coax Jesus out of doing God's Will, Jesus gradually turned the fear into courage & confidence which lasted until the end of the film. I was able to feel that it was the complete trust & faith Jesus put in His Father which gave Him the courage & confidence.Maia Morgenstern also did a fantastic part of Mother Mary. The flashbacks tell the audience that Mary loves Jesus very much. But she also truly believed that Jesus is the promised Messiah. Although heartbroken and grieved from witnessing her son's suffering, she allowed God's Will to be done and displayed an impossibly tough self-restraint, as a result of her faith.The flogging & nailing scenes were so realistic that the audience may be able to feel the pain with every lash or every hit of the mallet (on the nails).The film not only provides a visual interpretation of Jesus' suffering and makes the audience feel how hardened the hearts of the Pharisees were, it also shows us the power of faith (in God) and makes us feel God's compassion to us.In conclusion, the Passion of the Christ made me appreciate the well known biblical verse ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son so that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life"" (John 3:16).",The Passion of the Christ

This movie easily shows more violence and whippings and blood and gore than anything I've ever seen bar none.Disgusting times ten.Mel Gibson should be ashamed of himself for trotting out this kind of insane garbage.Then again it's all about the money isn't it.Feel sorry for all the young children whose religious parents will insist they view this mind jolting terror.,The Passion of the Christ
2026,heimdalgc,GREAT movie,10,21 December 2005,I was shocked at when I enjoyed this movie so much. At first I wasn't keen about the whole Jesus thing since I don't really like organized religion. Than I thought how could a movie star be a good director.boy was i wrongIf you go into this movie just to see it as that you will most definitely enjoy it. It doesn't matter to me if it's historically accurate or goes by the bible. I watched it as a movie and to see what all the hype was about.I loved the fact that it wasn't in English and didn't find it hard to follow at all. If anything I felt this was a great way to get yourself into the time period.The movie was extremely well done and it flowed nicely and even as I left the theater I left with a sense of wanting to do something good! The movie could get a little gory but I didn't think it was anywhere near as bad from what I heard. I thought it was done perfectly.So don't tell yourself you won't see the movie because you disagree with what it's saying. That's not what the movie is. If you just sit back with an open mind you are sure to love it. It is amazingly well done and I felt it could have won Best Picture. You will definitely like this movie if you see it with an open mind.,The Passion of the Christ
2027,doublem1,An absolute masterpiece. Brilliant. Well done Gibson.,10,7 December 2004,"Firstly to those people who have not seen it and disagree because of its violence, this is a LOVE story. Not violence for the sake of violence.I think this film isn't even that violent, and for that reason i think you should let your older children watch it because its good education.Gibson portrays it like it really was suppsose to happen. And does it greatly. I don't like love stories but i love this. An absolute brilliant piece of work.Every last scene is significant and necessary. And this film made me cry at the end, its that sad. A really well told Thought-provoking film.And I think its a shame about all the people around the world criticising this film. They even say the film his against the Jews(Or something like that I cant remember). That made me laugh. WATCH THE FILM AND GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT FIRST. I believe that you cant comment on a film you have not seen.And they say a women died while watching this film, well she could have died at anytime.A+++++++++++++++++ Watch this film you wont be disappointed.",The Passion of the Christ
2028,shoreboy1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,4,12 December 2004,"This movie was barbaric and bloody and really made me feel like Mel Gibson has flipped his lid. It may actually be a little more realistic than what is taught from the Bible, but doesn't make it a great move. It was definitely not worth watching and I'm glad I didn't pay at the theater. Acting was hard to determine due to the fact that it was all spoken in a language I don't speak, nor do many others in the world. The set and props were about the only thing I can say were good in the whole shamble of a movie. Definitely down there with Gigli and other horrid movies. Yuck.

I've Recently Watched The Passion And Was Harldy Moved By It, Considered The Perfect Film For Anybody, The Passion Takes The Story Of Jesus And Strips Away All the Important Parts Of Jesus Life, His Teachings, Miracles Etc. And instead Focuses On The Brutal Torture He Endured Prior To Crucifiction. I Guess Mel Gibson Felt That The Wisdom And Love Of Jesus Wasn't Interesting Enough To Carry Into A New Retelling Of His Life, He Instead Streches One Line From the New Testament ""Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him"" - Into A Two Hour Full Length Feature Film. Assuming Everyone Knows What Kind Of A Great Person Jesus Was And What Great Things He Did, Gibson Decides To Skip Character Development And Go For The Thoat.

2030,jdmccann1,"excellent film...a must see for all, especially Christians",10,30 January 2005,I found the film to be accurate according to my beliefs. I am a catholic...but not a strict catholic. I would say I'm a thinking person who does not believe in all the dogma 'stuff' coming from the Vatican. That said... I felt the film was a compelling drama...well acted and well directed sparing no expense to display the times of Christ's Crucifixion. The acting was superb from the lead role to all the supporting cast and should have been a leader in awards for Best Picture and Best Acting and...all other awards to put it at the top of the list for films made in 2004. At this writing I know it was not even nominated which I think is a drastic mistake brought about by the political world in 2004. As a aside I'm think Fahrenheit 9/11 should have also been nominated in 2004. Many kudos should be given to Mel Gibson for his sincere effort which hopefully was acknowledged at the box office. Thank you....,The Passion of the Christ
2031,the-dark-saint,nothing monumental ! splatter !,1,24 December 2004,"Just this movie and must admit, that I was shocked ! Only good idea was to leave the original biblic languages, although it was sometime boring to read the undertitles all the time, but interesting because I understood most of the Latin parts. But considering the world's situation (concerning the jews(israel) ans palis), it's unresponsible like the jews were shown in this movie! Some could get antisemitic after this und I understand now why many people were against this movie. We also don't know how it was really in these times (also Gibson not!), so I think it was his mere interpretation of the story of Jesus Christ. Under the line, it is a good costume-Hollywood-movie, exploiting a holy man for some splatter-fans. I don't want to see such splattering crap, whether it was so or not. It has no documentary sense nor it is something big (monumental) like Ben Hur or the old Jesus-movies! Worth a ""1"" !",The Passion of the Christ
2032,res1tv3c,Great depiction of the last hours of Christ,10,6 January 2005,"I feel that Mel Gibson did a fantastic job in his depiction of the last hours of Christ. Some of the elements he used (Satan's presence in the background during his time of torture) to bring across his message were unique and well worth the time and money spent to revisit our commitment to following Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Just look what Jesus Christ went through for each one of us...He Paid It All! that we might live eternally with him in paradise. Don't analyze the type of cruelty that was administered; instead, look at what Christ went through--For You and Me--He paid it all to redeem us from our sins...and that is just what this movie is trying to get across to all of us.

2033,stclair-2,bible,1,12 January 2005,"Not a bible scholar but while watching I thought - 'this part is from Mark; this part is from John', etc. Catholics are taught the stations and have their own reasons why Jesus was sentenced to death, not that Protestants don't, but I think they care less about the particulars which are dominantly Catholic in this film.I saw it twice and got physically ill twice. Wal-mart puts the DVD/VHS and the companion book with all its graphic violence out on the shelf. The book, in the Wal-mart here, was on a stand as you walk in. What a nice thing for a 5 year-old to see. But it refuses to sell CD's with the 'Advisory' sticker on it. I guess violence is OK. Just ask them for bullets.As far as accuracy goes I guess from a Catholic point of view its dead on. :) Since there are a few points where the synoptic gospels and John don't really agree I don't think anyone would try to call this a historically accurate film.",The Passion of the Christ
2034,pansyliberalpinko,Has Mel Gibson become a religiose Wes Craven ?,3,13 January 2005,"This film was simply shocking; Gibson reprises his role as Hollywood's epic arch-victim, this time portraying literature's best known martyr. The outcome is a horror movie of similar gore-fest genre to the early works of Wes Craven. From a recent high point of Braveheart, on a downward slope through the disappointing Patriot, Mr. Gibson has managed to hit a new career low; the only surprising thing is that he did not make Jesus's persecutors English, this would have been a nicely consistent finishing touch to his trilogy of persecution. But who knows? Mr. Gibson may not stop at a trilogy even now he may be scanning the annals of literature to find his next persecution project (God help us).

Few movies can move the audience as this one does. Mel Gibson could not have done a better job. This is a very violent film, but I seriously doubt it is the MOST violent film in history. This film does not exploit violence as other films do. Saving Private Ryan is equally if not more violent.Artistically the movie is excellent, from a spiritual standpoint the movie is excellent. Mel Gibson in no way made an anti-Jewish film. The mere fact that Hollywood did not endorse this film speaks loudly that it is an awesome representation of Jesus. Had this film ridiculed Jesus or Jews or Christianity it would have been lauded by Hollywood. Mel Gibson deserves a lot of credit for making such a powerful movie. The criticsim of Mel Gibson is further proof that this movie supports Christianity instead of making a mockery of it. Further proof of the hypocrisy of Hollywood.The film is quite long, 2 hours and 6 minutes, but it does move quickly. I cannot find any thing negative to say other than possibly the length of the film.This movie will make you think and think hard about the death of Jesus, it is a hard film.

What Mel did in his movie might seem horrible, but like he said, there's no sugar coat on this, and that really showed the abundant love God gave to us thru His Son Jesus Christ. Excellent work Mel! God bless u! Jim Cavievel portraying Jesus in such magnificent way, the cinematography is beautiful, the score is very touching, it's perfect! The only thing that lack from this movie is a very short scene of Christ resurrection (less than 10 second i guess), if only this scene is longer, i would score A+ to this movie.

Gender, age or nationality did not matter. For the first time in my life I experienced something of this magnitude. No other film was able to reveal the pain and the reason why Jesus died for all of us. By observing other people in the theater it was clear that everyone quietly reaches out for the truth.

It's entitled ""The Passion of the Christ"" for a reason: it is a depiction of Christ's PASSION.. his SUFFERING. If you were expecting to see two hours of a story on Jesus' life, then why did you bother watching the movie and writing a bad review on it? If the title itself explains to you that it's a movie about torture, don't go in expecting anything else. You don't compare apples and oranges. You don't watch a movie about someone's physical suffering that spans but a short time of that person's life and dismiss it for not being a biography detailing that someone's good deeds done throughout the course of his life.

It, in detail, shows Jesus' last hours of life, before dying on the cross. However, I believe Mel Gibson's idea of showing agony and suffering is perhaps too much for most Christians to stomach. I wanted my mom to see it, but she didn't want to see it specifically because of the gore. I think the majority of Christians will enjoy this movie, Catholic, Evangelical, or Protestant. It was quite faithful to the Bible, and had a few creative touches by Gibson. The best part that he did while directing it was to vividly portray Jesus and Mary as very close, and showing how much they loved one another. All in all, it is worth a watch.

He was just telling the story as he heard it. The scenes were very gory but that is what they did to him. He suffered for us, even Mel Gibson was in the movie. He played the guy nailing him to the cross telling the whole world that we all killed Jesus. Jesus was born for our sins, that is why he was born. This movie was very moving and when I seen it in the movies various amount of nuns had to leave the theater. I thought this movie was also touching too, because it got me thinking of who I really am.

I imagine a Buddhist watching this movie and the reaction she or he must have had. Why was it so important to portray the last 12 hours of Christ's life, anyway? There were dozens of 12-hour slots that could have been chosen from Jesus' life far more interesting than the blood-splattered last. And why the mixture of realism and low-tech sci-fi effects?

Bye the way - I write this as a non-religious person. The film was very watchable, never boring and Caviezel was superb in the main role. Your heart really went out to him - even as a ""non-believer"". I have to say that after all the acres of print I had read about the violence and bloodshed in the film, I actually felt it was rather less nasty than I may have feared. Certainly more visceral than, King of Kings, Greatest Story ever Told etc, a lot of the worst scenes took place in slow motion, off camera etc which somehow did make things easier to stomach. I can imagine if Mike Leigh or Ken Loach had made this it would have been far more unpleasant!Powerful, moving, even if you don't actually ""buy"" the central storyline. Jim C truly looks as if he has gone thru hell. Respect is due - to him and all.I think that the final few moments, segueing into the closing credits would have been quite something to experience in a full cinema!",The Passion of the Christ
2045,Hollywood44,Wow!,10,20 February 2005,"This was an outstanding movie. To me, being a Christian, I guess helped my vote. But truthfully I thought Mel Gibson put tons of effort into that movie, and it really showed. The actors were outstanding. I am an actor and trust me, it takes lots of energy and effort to act in that movie. It's definitely a movie I recommend watching, and I don't think it's a movie that's meant for people to enjoy. Which makes sense to me because most people don't enjoy others being tortured. But in my opinion, it's a very important movie to watch, especially for non-believers. I hope others watch this movie with an open heart, and maybe see the truth in it. Thanks.",The Passion of the Christ
2046,rlm1947,Why would anyone not revere this film?,10,8 April 2005,"The credits begin rolling, the lights remain low. No-one hears the usual sounds of people getting up or dropping their popcorn bags and soda cups on the floor. No-one tells his wife he'll meet her outside the men's room. Everyone just sits there. Very little conversation. Nearby you hear someone sobbing. Over there too. A rather large man with a stunned look on his face, and tears streaming down it, quietly repeats ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" Who cares about the Oscars? Because of this presentation I just might make it to Heaven.This does not just wring the emotions, though it does do that. You have to concentrate. Pay attention! You feel the pain, but you also come to know the why of it. You are well aware of the players. You know the plot. Now you know what happened, not from reading about it, but from being there.Don't say ""Hooray!"" Say ""Alleluia!""",The Passion of the Christ
2047,user-866-299926,The Passion of the Christ Review,9,9 December 2013,"I have recently watched a movie The Passion of the Christ for my religion homework. I used to watch this movie with my family when I was small. However, after watching this movie countless times, it still never fails to amaze me. This movie was filmed according to what the gospels- Matthew, Luke, Mark and John wrote in the New Testament. It talks about Jesus last 12 hours of life. Starting from the agony in the garden until his resurrection.The actors in this movie were truly amazing and talented. Especially Jim Caviezel who plays the role of Jesus Christ. He brings out his emotional feelings when he acted out as he was on the cross. This movie was an extremely moving, touching and emotional experience to the audience. I still remember when my family and I used to sit in the couch in the living room sobbing and speechless. This movie really means a lot to me. If I did not watch this movie on the first place, I will not probably know who Jesus is. Throughout this movie, it has build a really special and deep connection between God and I. Every time I re-watch this movie, I always gain new things that I have never notice before. Some people might say this movie is too brutal for kids to watch, but I will say if you let your kids to watch it, you will definitely not regret it. Although there are a lot of bloody scenes, it actually shows how Jesus sufferings were beyond what we thought.If anyone I know who is a Christian, I will definitely recommend them to watch this movie because watching movies will help them understand more than reading the bible in terms of the ""emotional level"".",The Passion of the Christ
2048,Josh02,Best Movie Ever,10,27 February 2005,"Yep, this about says it all ""Best Movie Ever"" -Me. This is a must see. Check your local video store for a DVD or VHS. The Passion of the Christ, is such an awesome movie. It is modeled after my favorite person that ever walked the face of this planet, Jesus Christ. I hope if you have not seen this movie you will. It is about the last 12 hours of his life. But do not be mistaken the movie is NOT 12 hours long. The movie is not in English, but do not let this stop you from watching it. There are English subtitles. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. And I ask you again if you have not seen this movie please go out and rent it or buy it.",The Passion of the Christ
2049,jfaye_morgan,Yea Passion,10,28 February 2005,"I went to see this movie with my husband and 19-year-old daughter -- the first time. It was not a 'good' movie. We all cried. How we hated to see the meanness that was directed towards a man who did no wrong! This however was the best movie about the death of Christ that is in existence. It was so close to the biblical account -- not as horrible maybe as what actually happened -- but close enough to give us a better idea. I invited my neighbor who does not go to church -- though Catholic -- to see it with me. She was very moved. I kept both sons' children and presented them with tickets so they could go. I also bought tickets for my niece and her husband -- kept her small son -- for her to go. This was an opportunity to witness in a different way. The Passion was so very well made and believable that the story actually seemed to come alive on the stage. We were very impressed with the acting. ""Mary"" was so superb as well as ""Jesus"". Actually, there did not seem to be a ""poor"" actor or actress. The language was beautiful and so interesting. It was a movie that transcended anything that we've viewed in our lifetime.",The Passion of the Christ
2050,lolasaenz,It is as it was.,10,1 March 2005,"This movie tells the story of Salvation in an impressively real manner, which should be very close to the way things were done at the time of the Roman occupation of Israel. The love of God for Humanity and the sacrifice of His only begotten Son for the Salvation of Mankind provides a glimpse of the Infinite Nature of God's Compasion towards His creatures. This excellent movie is a call to reality, because Christians are used to a sanitized version of the crucified Christ which must be very far from the events of that time. Knowing what Christ and His Mother really went through, as well as the way in which other followers were affected by the Passion, sheds a lot of light on events we tend to take for granted or at least see in an merely abstract fashion.",The Passion of the Christ
2051,dotmacis,A true film,10,11 March 2005,"My girlfriends and I first saw the Passion movie shortly after its release last year. We were highly anticipating it. This is my first comment on the IMDb board so please bear with me.I have been a born-again Christian for nearly 16 years and attend a street ministry church on a regular basis with my friends. We were absolutely spellbound and glued to our seats from the first to the last. The movie was a very accurate description of the last twelve hours of Jesus' life on this earth. The only slight complaint I have about this film is that the subtitles could have been a tad larger in size. My friend Michelle is visually impaired so during the movie I had to whisper each word into her ear. I made sure that it was OK with everyone around me to do that, and nobody had any problems.I first saw Jim Caviezel in ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and absolutely loved his performance (that's part of my DVD collection now) so I was highly anticipating seeing him in this movie. And boy ... I sure wasn't disappointed. He thoroughly got into the part and it was quite obvious in certain scenes that he was suffering for real. I later found out that he was whipped by accident at one point and now bears the scars to prove it. I have seen many movies in which different men have portrayed Christ and Jim's interpretation, in my opinion, has been by far the most realistic. Monica Bellucci's performance as Jesus' mother Mary was absolutely spellbinding and very poignant, as was Maia Morgenstern's portrayal of Mary Magdalene. I found the other actors to be wonderful as well.Now, here are a few points about the movie itself. Yes, it's graphic and violent beyond measure. But even this, as violent as it was, is absolutely NOTHING compared to what happened to Jesus in real life. One reader commented about the cat-of-nine-tails. This instrument of torture was one of the most barbaric devices ever invented. It was embedded with all manner of sharp, pronged objects which were designed to catch on the skin and rip it off when the instrument was pulled back. This was quite graphically and truthfully demonstrated in the movie. Jesus was whipped 39 times with this monstrosity. He was also beaten, punched and spit upon. And then, truthfully, He was forced to carry His own cross to Golgotha (eventually with the aid of Simon). Yes, this was also in the movie - but did you also know that His beard was plucked out by the roots, that He was absolutely naked and wasn't even recognizable in human form on that cross?? Many people also felt that this movie was anti-Semitic. With due respect to these people, I found absolutely nothing in the movie to support their beliefs. Yes, the Jewish Sanhedrin wanted Him to die as they considered him to be a blasphemer and not the Messiah. But let me be quick to point out that not all Jewish people felt that way. Yes, the Romans (led by Pontius Pilate) beat Him and crucified Him. But do you know what? Every single person in the whole world (even those not yet born at that time) put Him on that cross. When God first created Adam and Eve, He had a one-on-one personal relationship with them and that relationship was broken when sin entered the world in the form of Satan as the serpent in the garden. In the Old Testament the Jewish high priest had to enter the Holy of Holies once a year (on the Day of Attonement) to make a sin offering to God. The lamb for the sin offering had to be without blemish. When Jesus went to that cross, He became that sin offering as He Himself was without sin. He did this so that we could have that personal relationship with God again. And He did this out of great love. He could have quite easily gotten down off that cross. And at His command, ten thousand angels would have easily come down to help. But He chose to give His life for our sake and take our place on that cross (and yes, we deserved to be there ... not Him). You may remember that scene in the movie where just after He has died there's an earthquake and you see what happens in the Jewish temple. What happened was that the veil in the temple was torn in half, meaning that now each one of us could have a one-on-one relationship with God. Before that, only the high priest could communicate with God, and even he could only do that once a year. Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the cross gave us the opportunity to have a personal relationship with God at all times.Some people reading this review may think I'm talking about religion. I assure you that I'm not. Religion is nothing more than man's attempt to reach God. What I'm talking about is a relationship with Jesus Christ, who is now very much alive and is sitting on God's right hand side. He arose from that grave after three days and is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. This movie is a fantastic representation of exactly what He went through because He loves us so much and He wants us to be able to spend eternity with Him in heaven. Since we couldn't do that on our own (God is perfect and can't be around sin), He willingly took our place. I pray that each person will come to have a personal relationship with God before death comes. May God bless you all.Dorothy",The Passion of the Christ

I thought this film was amazing, I was glued to the screen from start to finish, the performances where realistic, it made me see the story of the crucifixion in a different light, there was no need for subtitles, I would still have been captivated. There was real passion behind the making of this film, you can physically feel the hatred the priests had for Jesus. It could have been called passion of the Director.

2053,bgmfl,The most perfect movie ever!,10,11 March 2005,"""The Passion of Christ * Recut"" is an even a better movie than the first, which I also saw on opening day, a little more than a year ago. The acting is beyond excellent, not just any one character, but all involved, including each and every extra.The Academy of Arts & Sciences has lost ALL credibility with me and many others, after ignoring, in 2004, the first, GREAT, GREAT film and now what will they do with Recut, an improvement of perfection?""The Passion of Christ"" had an effect on me, like no other movie I've ever seen! I received an up-lifting, powerful new love of my faith and an understanding of the greatness of Jesus love and forgiveness. People will be watching Gibson's, ""The Passion of Christ,"" in 3005 and the message will still be crystal clear and as endearing as it is today, as this story matter has an enduring and ever lasting life of it's own.I think this movie was directed by the ""Hand of God,"" as the perfection of The Passion is beyond the powers found within mortal man.

Best Director, Best Actors, Best Make-up, Best Cinematography, Best Film, unbelievable obstacles - language/communication barriers. Just phenomenal! The story line is in the bible. The humanity of the film was indescribable. The love-indescribable. As a Catholic Christian I know that humanity killed Jesus - it was the will of the Father that the Son die for humanity's sins, past present, and those to come. We have that understanding. We also know that his suffering was ABOVE what any human could sustain; because Jesus was God/in the image of man; he was able to withstand such horrific and painful torture and suffering. Mel Gibson was God's instrument to bring the story of Jesus' Passion to humanity; and he did a more than EXCELLENT job. The musical sound track is dynamic and highlights so much of the 'way of the cross' all the way to the crucifixion and the death of Our Lord.What a film-there will NEVER be another!!

2057,riesdad-1,Wonderful movie,10,17 March 2005,"Having gone to Catholic school, I've spent a lot of years trying to lose any sense of what happened there. This includes pooh-poohing anything that might smack of religion. So I avoided seeing this movie, even through all the rumble of ""it's a terrific movie"" that occurred after it came out. My previous experience with movie depictions included the Romans speaking with an English accent, presumably so I would know they were Roman. Some Pontius Pilates seemed to think they were Caligula on a day he forgot his lithium.But this movie impressed me with the intent- imagine, Jesus speaking his native Aramaic instead of Shakesperean English. I tried to follow the Latin, but was only halfway successful there. However, I really appreciated everyone speaking in the language they spoke. Before I leave this language thing, I have to say, I even liked the one Roman who (to my ear) spoke Latin with an Iberian accent. Perfect! The historical motivations were another thing about this movie that clicked with me. Pilate could not avoid killing Jesus because the Jewish priests would start an insurrection; if he did kill Jesus, then maybe His followers would start an uprising. And if another uprising occurred, Pilate himself would die.Missing was the motivation for the Jewish priests- his ""trial"" for blasphemy might have been enough to justify killing him, but I wondered what made the priests put him on trial in the first place. Of course, Jesus threatened them- he would be the King of the Jews, and this event, if they allowed it to happen, would take away their temporal power as religious leaders. Sure, we see a goofy Herod, bent on carnal, this-worldly pleasures as titular king, but the real power rested with the priests in a theocracy.The devil, though an apt entity in theology, seemed a bit contrived. The audience already had an image of what the human Jesus looked like but no one quite knew what the devil looked like, nor understood why he would sometimes have a snake (albino at that) or a voracious crow appear. And the devil's mobility, sliding around with no gait, was clever, except that was how the nun moved in ""The Blues Brothers,"" whose plot also involved ""a mission from God."" Yes, there seems to be a large gap between these movies. I'm not sure how to explain the nun or the devil's rolling around the set in either of these.I really liked this movie. I'm sorry I waited so long to see it. I think Gibson did a good job of telling this story of Jesus with both religiously synched and historically apt features.",The Passion of the Christ

I found your vision of the Passion of Christ, not only accurately portrayed but vividly moving. I was humbled by the impact of the price that Jesus (who is God) paid for me. I took it deeply personal.Now, my dear servant of God, take it to the next level. Take it FROM THE PASSION TO THE Resurrection. Many, many individuals could have probably done and even claimed what Christ did, but no one in History that I know of, and that can be validated, ever rose from the dead.This, this, is the hope of our salvation. This is what all our hope rests on. For no one but God could become, THE Resurrection. Jesus walked for 40 more days after He rose and over 500 witnesses saw Him ascend. HE IS GOD, AND THIS PROVES IT. I HAVE NO DOUBT.JUST ADDED (03/25/2005) I just had a thought. What if you decided to make another film on Jesus and this time on the 3 days before the Resurrection? I don't know any film maker who has done this. There are scriptures that tell of Jesus decending into hell ( if you will) to set the captives free. He also make a SHOW of Satan, parading him up and down showing this loser.That would be spectacular.

2059,Balian_of_Ibelin,A Superb Film On Multiple Levels,10,27 March 2005,The Passion Of The Christ is an epic piece of film making. It contains all the right ingredients to be an all time classic and I recommend that even if you don't believe that there was man called Jesus then you still take a look at it. Yes the violence is a major point in the film but that is what the whole point of the film is. To show Jesus suffering and to show us what really happened. Jim Caviezel is the perfect Jesus and is undoubtedly the star of the piece. The film is spoken in the language at the time so be prepared to read the subtitles.

Only what was written in the New Testament can we draw conclusions, yet as famous as Jesus seems to have been in those times, what was written by the Romans? Also, most of us will never really know what ghoulish spectres were present as our version of the New Testament has been so viciously edited that we are to redeem our conclusions purely by faith, and not historically, and even the latter would not be accurate as the burden of proof would still be missing. Pilate or the Jewish priests. Which one is the most to blame? True Pilate had the last say but who took Jesus to court and accused him of speaking the Truth. Would we nowadays blame Judge Lance Ito for letting O.J. Simpson go free and innocent? Of course not. Ergo, the movie stands its ground and lets the viewer conclude where to put the blame. 10/10 no doubt.",The Passion of the Christ

There is no need to add a female looking devil with a mini me. I don't get that scene at all, someone please explain it to me.Also Mary looked completely stoned the entire time, why the bizarre scene of her mopping up the blood?

2063,enim238,The Passion of the Target Audience,4,1 November 2014,"I don't think this flick really adds anything substantial, new or fresh to the Splatter genre. The amount of extremely graphic, gory and sadistic violence is very high, even for a splatter movie, and Gibson directs it fairly well. What it lacks is giving any meaningful context to the gorefest that goes on and on (and on and on... and so on) after the introduction of the premise. I must admit that I am a bit biased - splatter is not one of my favorite genres, and I know many splatter fans don't see well-rounded characters or well-reasoned motivations really necessary in the genre.What premise, you might ask. Basically, the lead character Jesus is a prophet and a leader of a religious sect, and (rightly) accused of claiming to be a son of a local god in the Roman province of Judea. Egged on by the powerful local religious fanatics, the prefect Pontius Pilate (as an aside, he is an actual historical person) sees no alternative to horrible abuse and execution of hapless Jesus, even though he doesn't really want it. Brutality ensues.Cue a bunch of (over)long sequences of stomach-churning violence and a Sixth sense-like plot twist at the very end: It turns out Jesus really is a son of a local deity like he claimed, thus actually unkillable (at least permanently) and he gets the last laugh. I'm not too squeamish when it comes to unnecessary fictional violence, but this movie really pulls no punches. Eyeball-eating raven... huh? Was there a POINT to it, besides upping the gore factor with a random gross detail? Tooth for tooth, eye for being sarcastic to our protagonist? I hope there wasn't, because if Mr. Gibson thinks so, I feel for his close ones.The script fails quite badly. As I mentioned earlier, the splatter elements lack meaningful context. It's difficult to actually care about Jesus' hard luck beyond the revulsion any normal human being feels for seeing senseless, brutal violence against anybody. The movie evokes some ""emotions"", true, but it does it much the same way porn does. Revulsion or sexual arousal does not equate emotional connection to a cardboard cut-out character you see on the screen. The bad guys (both the actual abusers and their enablers) are plot devices. The Pharisees do what they do to bring forward the violent climax of the story, believable or historically accurate reasons be damned. The sadistic soldiers are just doing their job, which is being sadistic soldiers.All that lack of insight into the character is quite baffling, because the original source material does contain lots of useful things simply left out. The myth of Jesus has been published in a very popular anthology, which does in fact have four different versions with many interesting tidbits. If you read them, Jesus has an actual personality. He is even fairly interesting, prone to philosophical musings about ethics (book spoilers: he is pro-ethical behavior) that make him quite likable. If Gibson had bothered to use some of that, maybe it would have been possible to give an actual s..t about him.But no such luck. Instead, the movie's plot focuses solely on (a very violent and unphilosophical depiction of) the silliest part of the story: the inexplicable need of Jesus to be beat up to a pulp and die painfully without really dying, for reasons of great quasi-philosophical importance. That wouldn't really matter so much if there was something else to the movie. Movies are all about the willing suspension of disbelief. With this one I find it hard, because the plot and characters are sub-standard. It's all right to have some silly or implausible plot point, practically every movie has one or two. But here the silly plot point has become the plot.I feel actors do all right, considering what they have to work with. That side is a bit tricky to judge, because they are speaking in dead languages that they don't actually understand. But it seems natural enough. As for the ""realistic"" choice of using Aramaic, it feels like a gimmick here. Like performing Hamlet in Old Norse, because that's the language ""the real Hamlet"" used. Or at least would have used, if he had been real. Generally I'm in favor of using actual foreign languages (and actors fluent in those languages) instead of silly accents that denote ""Right now I'm speaking in a foreign language"", but it didn't feel necessary here. Gibson probably wanted the more gullible part of his audience confuse this stylistic realism with a proof of realism in his gory religious fantasies.All in all, after reading glowing reviews how this technically rather well-made but plot less, pointless, soulless and extremely violent splatter flick was thought-provoking, beautiful, and what-not, I can only come up with one explanation: people who are familiar with the source material ""see"" things that Gibson omitted from his version. Both thematically and plot-wise. They superimpose their personal interpretations of the whole myth over this horror version of its climax. At least, I hope so. The alternative explanation would be quite depressing.Oh, one more thing: the alleged antisemitic stuff in the movie was taken from the original myth. So don't shoot the messenger if the message isn't to your liking. Even if the message is to the messenger's liking. He's not responsible for the original message, he's just trying to milk the most out of it.",The Passion of the Christ
2064,bobgolfs56,Critique of The Passion of the Christ,10,28 August 2005,"This is the best portrayal of the Crucifixion of Jesus that has ever been made. It is truly a depiction of mankind's inhumanity to one of its own.This movie is something that mainstream Hollywood would never make because the powers that reside in Tinseltown really do not believe in Jesus or could care less about depiciting the Bible in any manner other than that in which a buck can be made.The acting by Jim Caviezel shows a depth of character that I have never before seen. It shows how Jesus willingly allowed himself to be humiliated, beaten mercilessly, and die the most horrible death a person could receive then or now in order to fulfill Biblical Prophecy and submit to His heavenly Father's will so that all mankind could be redeemed by His blood if they only believe in His death and victory over same.The Aramaic and Latin lend so much to the authenticity of the period. Mel Gibson should receive a special blessing for his decision to make such a realistic depiction of Jesus' suffering and willingness to fulfill HIs heavenly Father's grand plan for mankind to be reconciled unto Him.",The Passion of the Christ
2065,mrslow666,Jamieson Zakaria says this is a great alternative to other Jesus films,8,2 May 2005,"In comparison with the other 100 ""life of Jesus films"", The passion, proved to be a good alternative to them. The movie expresses the last twelve hours of Jesus in detail, and although it may seem gory to some, provided a truthful account that we should not stubbornly ignore. For those out their that judged the film on blood content rather than true meaning behind the suffering shown, should look beyond this and find for what the director truly intended to show. many people who watched the film were unhappy that it did not express symbolic events throughout Jesus's life, in my opinion, Mel Gibson did show many events, however, not throughout the entire movie. Mel Gibsons aim was to portray Jesus's biggest symbolic event of all, the crucifixion, the pain, the suffering and the sacrifice he made to the whole of humanity.Overall the movie portrays the true pain Jesus went through in order to save us. good movie!",The Passion of the Christ
2066,wsager-1,This film moved me more than any film I can ever remember!,10,3 May 2005,"I had a dream that I was walking through a foggy wooded garden in the moonlight and I heard someone agonizing in prayer. I could not understand what he was saying because it was not in English. As I got closer, I could see that it was Jesus. I had gone back in time and I was there with Him in the Garden of Gethsemane. Okay, so it wasn't a dream, I was actually engulfed in a very vivid and real movie. Mel Gibson has made a film depicting the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, so that we could really understand how He suffered just before He died.Mel is a devout Catholic, and actually of the old kind, before they stopped doing mass in Latin. I found myself asking a few questions at certain points in the film - ""What is that supposed to mean?"" As for accuracy, I believe Mel did fairly well. For starters, the actors are speaking in Aramaic with English subtitles, but I did not find that distracting. There are some things he added for dramatic effect. I suppose you would call it speculation.Everyone is going to have a different reaction to this film, I believe. I would not say you would go to enjoy a night at the movies. I would not call this a popcorn and candy flick, though I did see some folks there eating. It is intense, and it is extremely violent. If you are not used to a lot of blood and torn flesh, keep telling yourself ""It is only a movie,"" but if you stop and think about how true and real this is and that it happened to our Lord, when He was dying for our sins... well, how can you help but be very grateful? My wife said she cried once, and I just gave it up right off the bat. Maybe I started to choke back tears, but realized it wasn't going to work, so I just let it go, and they flowed freely and frequently. I lost count how many times I cried. The only thing I had to work at was to keep from sobbing. I have to hand it to Mel, he knew how to piece the film together. Just when I thought I could not take any more of Christ's suffering, he would cut to a flashback and I got to enjoy watching Jesus as a carpenter having fun with His mother, as a teacher in the sermon on the mount or with His disciples at the last supper. I would have loved to see more of those kinds of scenes, but it was a 2 hour film and the focus was on Christ's suffering and nothing else. The gospel message is there if you are paying attention. At the last supper, Jesus said, ""I am the way, the truth and the life, and no man comes to the Father, but through me."" The resurrection is only about 12 seconds at the end, which to me was a bit disappointing. But that is not the movie he was making. An interesting added character is Satan... who walks through the crowd and talks to Jesus in the garden. It reminds us that Satan is alive and walking among us.Jim Caviezel plays Jesus, and I thought he was excellent. They should have remembered him at Oscar time, as well as Mel and the whole film. Only 3 nominations and no wins was very disappointing, but not surprising. Jim played the ""Count of Monte Cristo"" and he had a lead role in ""Frequency"". Perhaps you have heard stories of how he was told by a stranger that he would be playing Jesus in 6 months, and 6 months later, they contacted him. He was 33 years old and his initials are J.C., so he figured he was right for the part. Well, he didn't get paid much if anything at all up front, and he was hurt in the filming... a dislocated shoulder and also was struck by lightening while filming the sermon on the mount. I hope he is rewarded in other ways for his daring performance.The actress playing Mary (His mother) was very good, too. She is a Jew from Romania. There is a lot of hype about this being an anti-Semetic film, but all of that is just people not understanding that we all killed Jesus. It was our sins that put Him on the cross. The whole thing was orchestrated by God, planned from the beginning and prophesied in scripture. Mel begins the film with the prophetic passage from Isaiah 53: He was bruised for our iniquities and with His stripes we are healed.I recommend this film. It is rated R for the violence, so you need to take that into consideration. For me it was an memorable experience that I will never forget. A+",The Passion of the Christ
2067,Lilac_Chickie77,.......wow,10,9 May 2005,"WOW! I can honestly say this was the first movie I cried throughout the entire thing! I loved the lighting and the effects in the film, and the actors were great. Allot of people have said that they over did the beating of Jesus, but I think they under did it! In the bible it says Jesus no longer looked like a man, and in the film he did, a very good-looking man at that :P. I recommend this film for any Religion who believes in Jesus, and for anyone who is not a Christian but just enjoys a beautiful...very depressing film. Even though I was so sad during the entire film, I must admit at the end I was really happy! And for those of you, who are thinking of watching this film, don't expect to cry throughout. I only did in the theater because it was so powerful with the volume and the tension in the audience. Though I still did shed a few tears while watching it at home, don't expect it to be as emotional as it would have been had you seen it in Theatre. And also, for those of you who are worrying about the language, don't worry! Once you get into the film you don't even realise it's in a different language. So enjoy the film if you're going to watch it, you'll love it!",The Passion of the Christ
2068,kwu0718,I explain the graphic content of this film and the meaning behind it all.,8,13 May 2014,"To start with, The Passion of the Christ is quite an awe-inspiring film that sheds light upon the manner in which Jesus was crucified. After doing some research on the movie's title, I even realized that the word ""passion"" used to refer to a state of suffering and pain (connecting to the immense amount of cruel beatings and treatment Jesus was forced to endure). The entire duration of the movie is approximately two hours, and almost three- fourths of those hours would probably be Jesus sustaining terrible injuries from his captors. The intense gore and violence portrayed in the film is far beyond what I expected.When reading the bible verses explaining how Jesus was killed, I would only think, ""Oh wow, that's horrifying!"" Now I have seen what those descriptions would actually look like, and I can't exactly say I was glad to. However, I have gained a deeper understanding of the price Christ had to pay for cleansing the people of the world of their sins. Before I continue with this review, I want to stress that this movie is something not to be shown to a family containing young children or in the classroom. The Passion of the Christ is filled with images relentless whippings, beatings, and the dripping of blood from Jesus's body. Moving on, I want to discuss how the movie portrayed Jesus's disciples. Many of the biblical books and movies I have seen depict them as clean-cut and well-mannered men. On the other hand, this movie, in my perspective, shows them as tough, rebellious individuals who resort to violence in order to protect their master. This is not overly surprising, because they are poor men in a chaos-stricken land, after all. In addition, I hadn't really known what the disciples were supposed to look like beforehand. To sum the movie up, it is theologically accurate (in a gory manner) and spiritually moves the audience. It must have taken the actors a great deal of serious training in order to pull of such beautiful portrayals of the biblical characters. I give The Passion of the Christ eight stars out of ten.",The Passion of the Christ
2069,amitksharma,Well-made movie but authentic?,7,10 May 2005,"Though I liked the look and feel of the movie, I have one doubt regarding the part Monica Bellucci played. According to what I've been taught in school Jesus had saved a prostitute from being killed by stones (the first stone should be cast by the one who has never sinned). The movie shows Bellucci's character to be the one. Now at this site I come to know that she played Magdalene. As far as I know the Vatican has discarded the misconception that Mary of Bethany (the prostitute) and Mary Magdalene (wife of Christ according to Dan Brown in Da Vinci Code) are the same woman. Even if Magdalene wasn't Christ's wife none of the Biblical scriptures show her to be a prostitute. In that case isn't the movie's authenticity with respect to the scriptures doubtful?",The Passion of the Christ
2070,nickyaguzin,The Passion of the Christ Review,10,30 May 2014,"The Passion of the Christ, a film directed by Mel Gibson, is the story of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. Controversial claims made by Jesus angered many. The Jewish leaders, particularly angered, paid Judas, one of Jesus' apostles, to betray him which led to Jesus' capture and ultimately his death on the cross. Accused of blasphemy, Jesus was publicly tried for his teachings, which many believed included using demons to preform miracles. Consequently, Pontius Pilate condemns Jesus to death, following the wishes of the crowd. Having been raised a Christian, I thought I knew the story of my religion. While watching, I soon realized that the stories I had been told were missing many gruesome and pivotal details. Previously unaware, I discovered that Jesus was scourged in a brutal and appalling way. Well acted and gripping, this film captivates its audience. The strong cast backed up with incredible special effects were the highlights of the movie. Although I found this film to be educational and informative, it is not an easy viewing due to many of its horrifying scenes and demonstrations of cruelty. A movie for those who want to see the real story of Jesus' fate, it is deserving of a 5/5.",The Passion of the Christ
2071,user-17-176244,Moritz's Passion of the Christ Review,9,2 June 2014,"I really enjoyed The Passion of the Christ. It primarily focuses on the last part of Jesus' life where he is condemned by a religious group and beaten to near death ending with him getting hammered up to the cross. When I was first recommended this movie I wasn't expecting much. I'm not religious in anyway and haven't ever seen a religious movie. So going into this movie I wasn't expecting much, all I could really hope for was for it to be short. Half way through the film I couldn't stop watching, there was so much going on and so much detail put into every scene. It started off in the woods with Jesus' capturing. I like that the scene was kept dark and ominous which created a very spooky feeling as I was watching. The rest of the movie was about Jesus' capture and punishment. The realism of the movie is what kept me watching. Many movies about Jesus chose to cut down or simply not include the brutality but Mel Gibson opted to show everything. The movie contained a lot of blood and gore thus I would not recommend it to anyone who can't handle blood. The only real criticism I have for the movie is the length of some scenes. The scene in which Jesus gets punished by the guards went on for a bit to long and I lost interest by the end. Besides that overall the movie was a great watch. The fact that the movie is based on a religious topic may throw a lot of people off from watching it but after watching it myself I would definitely recommend it to anyone religious or not.",The Passion of the Christ
2072,user-18-431995,The Passion of the Christ Review,8,3 June 2014,"From the get go, Mel Gibson's film was captivating yet educational for religious purposes. Although rather gory and filled with intense scenes that some may not like to see, it accurately portrayed the painful last minutes of Jesus Christ's life. Because the Bible does not go too much into Jesus' life, rather focusing on his teachings, this movie clears up a lot of misconceptions and explains better the tension between him and the Roman ruler in his city at that time. This movie is not just a film, but an experience, it is almost like we are there witnessing the events because it is just so real and painful at the same time. Prior to filming, Mel Gibson made sure that the last 12 hours or so of Jesus' life would be accurately portrayed and in accordance to the Gospel. The film is both artistic and educational, information from the bible itself has been included and used, and nothing ""non-biblical"" has been added to enhance the film for Hollywood needs. The film is pretty good because Gibson combines information with drama, and still manages to keep it interesting and not making end up a purely educational clip. Gibson created this tale of Christ that can both reach the religious and the non-religious, opening eyes everywhere and bringing more awareness to Jesus' life. We often forget the dynamics and the brutality of Roman rule at this time, and this sure does remind us of what times were like and how high tensions were regarding religious standpoints and religious teachings that challenged supreme rule. One thing I did not know prior to the film was that Jesus and his mum were so close. As seen in the film, his mum stuck by him until the end and even looked up at him while he was nailed to the cross. This aroused many feelings, sad and reflective, and reminded us of the atrocities committed against Jesus and his family. Our time today and the time in this period were different, so its hard to know how revolutionary Jesus' teachings were, but to create such a reaction from the Romans... If I have any criticisms for this movie, it would be that too much focus was placed on the gory aspect it was almost like a Game of Thrones. Although his ending was brutal, as described numerous times, I think too much focus was on the pain of it. I think Gibson should have put more attention on the political and family dynamics, and stop putting really slow mo effects of blood and whipping.",The Passion of the Christ
2073,user-18-417912,Passion of the Christ World Religions Summary,8,3 June 2014,"Mel Gibson's 'the Passion of the Christ' was an interesting movie that was very visually gruesome. The director, Mel Gibson, is a Catholic himself, which explains why the movie is Biblically accurate. The movie is a basic overview of the last day of Jesus's life. From Jesus praying to God, to Judus betraying Jesus, to the final crucifixion, this movie covers it all. The movie covers the story from multiple angles of the Gospel, such as all the components of the story from Matthew, John, Mark, and Luke. The movie is relatively accurate. If you know the main story of Jesus's crucifixion, there won't be too many surprises. However, if you aren't Christian, brace yourself for a frightful film of the crucifixion of Jesus. Although this movie is a movie about the crucifixion of Jesus, Mel Gibson decides to include some flashbacks of the important events in Jesus's life. Such as, the last supper and teaching the twelve disciples. As a Christian, I know the basic story of Jesus's crucifixion, and wasn't too surprised with how the movie progressed. However, despite knowing the overall story, the visuals of the movie were a bit of a shock. I knew about all the terrible things that happened to Jesus, but in Church they don't often show too many visuals of what happened. They often just show a visual of Jesus and the crown of thorns, and that's about it. However, this movie covered all the violence Jesus faced. Although it was not a surprise Gibson decided to display everything Jesus faced according to the Bible, it was still a shock to me personally. What was surprising to me is that the movie doesn't show much about the resurrection. The movie is running long at 122 minutes, but as a Catholic, it is surprising Gibson decided to make this movie mostly about the crucifixion. The resurrection is a main part of Christianity and it's the part of the crucifixion story all Christians can celebrate about. However, Gibson decides to briefly include the resurrection in the movie, and strictly makes it mostly about the crucifixion. It is understandable, but at the same time, if I had not watched the movie I would have expected it to show more parts of the resurrection instead of just showing Jesus exiting the tomb.",The Passion of the Christ
2074,user-18-205179,Jesus Christ Movie,7,4 June 2014,"The Passion of the Christ (2004) is a biblical drama film directed by Mel Gibson. The film features Jim Caviezel as Jesus, Maia Morgenstern as Mother Mary and Monica Bellucci as Mary. This film depicts the final twelve hours of Jesus Christ's life, beginning with his walk in the garden to his resurrection. According to Gibson, the film is mostly based on the New Testament Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.This film helped me view Christianity in a different light because I was finally able to see a visual interpretation of the Bible and to see what the characters looked like. This benefited me greatly because I often had trouble understanding the wording of the Bible and it was hard to follow. With this film I finally could see what the Bible was referring to and I could finally understand what was going on. I started watching this film with the idea that the stories in the Bible were all soft and fuzzy, and that everyone was happy. When I finished this film, my previous idea was shattered and I realized that not everything in the Bible was as fuzzy as I thought out to be. As I watched this movie, I thought it had an excessive about of violence for a film about religion. There were some fairly brutal scenes of flogging and crucifixion that I felt wasn't appropriate for a religious audience. However, the film made six hundred million dollars at the box office on a budget of thirty million dollars. I would recommend this film to people who are curious about the final moments of Jesus's life.",The Passion of the Christ
2075,poiytr,"The passion of the Christ is more than a film, it's an experience.",10,12 October 2006,"The passion of the Christ is more than a film, it's an experience.Those that criticize it severely usually speak on a vengative manner for this film makes anyone with a heart, feel. Usually its criticized by Jews that do not feel comfortable with their past and don't want to have their past actions portrayed in film for fear of anti-Semitism, and other atheists that don't accept history or any religious doctrine.The problem with a film like this is that Christians will love it, and atheists and followers of other religions will hate it. It's almost never judged in any other way; every one takes their side and tries to protect it no matter what.But let's think about something else; in these times of an overly saturated film market, how many films are good? Or what makes them good? Usually an answer to that is if a film makes you feel something. This film is the true story of a mans sacrifice, whether people believe he was the son of God or not, historians have proved he did exist, he was crucified, and this is his story. When you narrate the story of a mans life, you must stick to the facts and that's what these filmmakers did. Whether other critics say it lacks dialog, or has no plot ..the plot is Jesus life. The first thing a film critic must know when judging a film, is that not all films can have the same critique structure. This is a semi biographical film; not so much about the life of a man, but about his death, more so, how it happened, in every detail. It's not a fictional epic to be written about as if the writers had fault of the events and how they happened. Later you can judge a mans life whether it was boring, exiting or just out of comment, but a biographical pictures job, is to stick to the facts, and this film does just that.The film narrates the torture, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.This isn't a film only for believers; it's a film that changes hearts, because Jesus changes hearts. Many ask why all the blood and the detail of his torture; his torture symbolizes what he had to go through for the ones he loved, and Mel Gibson researched extensively to know exactly what happened and how. It is not an exaggerated film; past films of the same story just haven't showed the crude reality of what happened and to what length humans and their hate can go to in the punishment of others. We must remember two things; the first is that we are now experiencing a new film era where our generation has evolved and is modern enough to handle crude visual elements that before were considered grotesque and banned from cinema; the other is that when Jesus was alive, he lived in a world of barbarians. The Romans, the most civilized men of that era were barbarians as well, this is the ancient world. So the way they acted and their methods of torture can not be portrayed in any other manner if you want to tell a story the way it happened. This isn't only a story about this mans death; it's the story of his pain. There's a common saying now a days ""everyone bares a cross in life"", this is the narration of the actual cross Jesus had to carry to get his message across. A message of love.Why do so many people claim this film changed their hearts? Because they get to know Jesus and his sacrifice. Let's understand a little more about Jesus, all he predicted was love among ourselves and unity. He got crucified for that. Anyone that disrespects Jesus must ask themselves why? If you don't understand a religion or do not wish to be part of it, no one can make you, but what's wrong about love among humans? And why disrespect a man that wants to teach this?continued below ... (manuel_pifano@yahoo.com)",The Passion of the Christ
2076,PrinceTaxan,The point of the movie,9,23 July 2005,"I was reading comments and many people said they hated The Passion because it doesn't accurately display Christ's life while on Earth. But the movie was not meant to. It was not meant to educate the audience about His teachings, show the audience the awesome miracles He performed, but to show what He went through for us. Christ was the son of God, but He went willingly to his death. He knew what was going to happen to Him on the cross, and knew that if He didn't go through the hell on Earth He did, then there would be no hope for every human on the planet. So, the point of the Passion is to portray the torment, torture, and agony that Christ went through because he loved us so much.",The Passion of the Christ

This film manages to captivate that I had never nor have I ever felt again. It evoked emotions and made me think about the historical time-frame it which it was created. The pain one man went through because of his words and convictions of life and God. It is a masterpiece....at the end of the screening I was crying, but what struck me more was the fact that there was an absolute silence and people did not rush to get out.

I cannot remember this bit 'and lo - our lord was pecked by - a crow!'

I just saw a guy being beaten and losing gallons of blood throughout the entire film.The movie may have excellent technical aspects, but for me it was gratuitous violence. I looked around and noticed that some people were so moved by the film that they were crying, and I thought that some of those persons are the same that get offended when they watch an action film like Die-hard or a horror movie like Halloween, movies with much lesser blood. The audience is getting moved by the film because the guy that they're ripping apart is Jesus, and religious people obviously would feel emotion; If the movie was the same carnage but without Jesus implied it would be just a ""Gore Film"".I think Gibson used people's faith in order to make profit with this movie. Anyone who believes in Jesus would feel moved if they show his suffering, that's evident, so those guys filmed a movie that's based on images of gratuitous violence and carnage and people think is ""emotional"" and ""faith reafirming"" just because ""is Jesus"".Think about it.

If Mel Gibson intends this voyeuristic wallow in blood and gore to increase our understanding or spiritual response to Christ's suffering he missed the mark. I find it hard to believe that prior to seeing this movie faithful Christians had any difficulty understanding that being scourged is horrific or that Christ suffered on the cross. This movie certainly doesn't add value to understanding the purpose of Christ's suffering, since theological exploration beyond agony is so shallow and superficial that it serves only to contribute to pop culture's repeated misinterpretation of scripture. For non-Christians or non-faithful Christians, I find it hard to believe that this movie helps them understand Jesus' death any better than they did before. A horrible waste.I will never understand why the vocal majority of Christians prefer Passion to Last Temptation of Christ. Temptation was pilloried by mainstream evangelists as blasphemous, but in reality is a much deeper exploration of Christ's life, death, and resurrection. Why boycott Temptation, but bus them to see Passion? Is their faith so weak it cannot be challenged by imagination or discourse?

Jesus played by James Caviezel was so realistic that you could not help but get caught up in the emotions of this well-known part of history. The elements of the films visual environment set the tone for this movie to be very effective in creating an emotional response in many of the controversial scenes. This film shows a cross between Jesus's subjective point of view and an objective point of view of the events. The costumes and makeup could not have been any more true to the period and commend a well- deserved applause.The movie begins with the exceptional use of lighting in the Garden of Gethsemane and then proceeds to dramatic irony in events that will bring Him to His death and end in His resurrection. The film proceeds with Judas Iscariot being tormented by the actions of betraying his friend. He is soon seeing demons in the faces of children who begin to chase him. His inability to escape brings him to a location outside of Jerusalem where he sees a dead disfigured donkey decaying. Unable to take any more torture he uses the rope to take his life. Scenes such as this show an excellent use of visual metaphors and symbolism by the filmmaker. The scene in which is especially heartfelt to me was when Jesus was being flogged. The graphics were remarkably authentic and utterly horrifying. Using canes to whip Jesus, you could hear and feel the power behind the actions, the marks that were left on His back. You could see the pain shown in His face and body when He struggled to stand back up. However, nothing would compare to the torture device they used to rip away his skin which was one of the most powerful visuals I had ever seen. Good, bad or indifferent, the sharp hook like metal tips on the whips that literally grabbed and stuck into the ribs, eventually loosened and took out chunks of flesh that splattered across the crowd and leaving an overwhelming amount of blood. Then to see Mary his mother with tears running down her face was a visual that anyone with a heart would have felt. Mel Gibson may have a flare for shock value as seen in his Mad Max (1979) movies which are some of his best movies he has created. However, I feel this one is my all-time favorite! The film ends with the use of outstanding visuals and metaphors. Throughout this film, you will see incredible camera work, dramatic structure, a cinematic wonder, an absolute must see movie! The Passion of the Christ should leave you with an absolutely grateful understanding about the gift of life that was so graciously given to you.",The Passion of the Christ
2090,jp37737,This movie is extremely important,10,24 July 2005,This movie is extremely important because it can lead people to Christ and help them to receive salvation. Salvation is eternal and we all need it. Jesus died for our salvation so that we can spend eternity with Him and not in hell. He wants us to believe in Him as John 3:16 says so we can have eternal life and not eternal hell. The sequel to this movie should be Resurrection to remind people that Jesus rose from the dead. He rose so that He might help us rise. No one else has done this nor can they. Mel Gibson risked a great deal to make this movie and he should receive a great reward for doing it. Being human he did make mistakes but it is still really impressive. May God richly bless him for his courage and strength. May someone read this and even be saved by it. John 3 is the most important chapter in the Bible I believe. The entire chapter should be read by everyone.,The Passion of the Christ
2091,donna_edmundson2001,deviated from scripture,1,29 July 2005,The first time I saw this movie I walked out not to far into it. I was totally repulsed by the poetic license (if you can call it that) the writer used in creating this monstrosity. I would never take a nonbeliever to see it because the story was not told exactly according to scripture. Plus scenes were added that were not in the Bible. I just finished watching the movie and am more convinced that it should be banned from public viewing. A little harsh yes and against our freedom of speech but it doesn't depict our God or his Son correctly. In my opinion a nonbeliever viewing this movie would surely not embrace a God who could put anyone let alone his son through this hideous torture.,The Passion of the Christ

If you got above a C in RE this is very good and enlightens the soul, and helps you forget about the fiddly catholic priests.

2093,lucslawyer,Actually...a boring movie...,3,6 March 2008,"I found this movie to be rather boring...I hit the fast forward button several times. Other than the use of Aramaic and Latin, there was nothing that really held my interest. I find I must agree with those who use the term ""torture porn"" to describe this film. There was blood and gore aplenty, but to what end? It was as if Gibson was saying ""Look how much pain and suffering Jesus endured for you...you must become a Christian!"". But if the pain and suffering of an individual is cause enough to believe, should I become a Jew because of Auschwitz?Although the apples and oranges comparison would be valid, I found myself thinking again and again of ""Jesus of Nazareth"" as I watched this movie. While both followed the standard Gospel narrative, ""Jesus of Nazareth"" was moving and uplifting, whereas ""Passion"" came across as a slasher film in Christian garb. I would definitely NOT recommend this film for children.I believe that Mel Gibson seriously missed the mark in the making of this movie. Much to the film's detriment, he ignored the (ironic) old Hollywood axiom that there are certain instances where violence can best be depicted by not showing it...and if he intended it to be a proselytizing tool, he failed.",The Passion of the Christ

It is just a shame that certain people found the movie to be to controversial...shame on you for judging it without even seeing it... because of this James Caviezel who portrayed Jesus was not nominated for a much deserved Oscar win... The way that he portrayed Jesus was beyond amazing.. I also thought that how he learned to speak an old and truly hard language was genius.. I truly recommend this movie to any one who understands and enjoys flawless movies like Passion... I salute Mel Gibson for being a true genius!!!!!!

Mel Gibson's directing is superb and the editing is brill it all pulls together well and keeps you wacthing until the end. Whether or not you are religious this film is well worth wacthing. i must say wacthing this film made me realise what Jesus really went through (not like any of the bulls**t they told you at school. wacthing this film in the dark on your own is probably a good idea if you don't want your friends to see you cry your eyes out. enjoy the film.",The Passion of the Christ

I do think the beatings are a little over the top!! i do think if i was in Jesus place i would be unable to walk again, let alone carry a huge cross. It also seems Jesus would only have carried the cross section of his cross and it would have been T shaped. Also he would have died with possibly hundreds of others on a frame outside the town. The nails would have gone though the wrists and not his hands and rested on the victims nerve so as the poor man rested down flashes of pain would result on the main nerve in the arm, the Persian started this practise. Wish a bit more about Jesus re-birth was in the film, so many people who don't believe expect Christmas Presents, and Easter Eggs.

2098,briantannenbaum,"what a horrible ""movie""",1,5 September 2005,"First off I understand what happened to Jesus was horrible and should not have happened to anyone. But if you look at this ""movie"" from the point of view that it is a ""movie"", this is just plain awful. Not only is it not entertaining, it is just vile. I beg all of you out there to go see the episode of South Park that analyzes this ""movie"" and the effect that it has had on people. In the cartoon at one point they refer to this ""movie"" as nothing more then a snuff film. I find that description to be highly accurate. After this ""movie"" came out I had heard many things about it everything from; it made Jews look bad, wow, Jesus suffered through all of this for us., to ""this is the most powerful film ever"" All of those descriptions being highly inaccurate. In my opinion it was only made because Mel Gibson was raised in a very religious environment and because he knew he would make a fortune off of it. Since the release of this ""movie"" I have seen many specials on TV pointing out numerous inaccuracies in it. So if the ""movie"" is not historically accurate, not entertaining, and sickening to watch, why would you want to watch it???? Movies are supposed to entertain us not make us feel guilty about not being more religious. I can not understand how anything good can come out of viewing this ""movie"". All I know is that after I saw it I just felt ill and I do not wish that feeling on anyone else.

Afterwards, I cried for like an hour nonstop. This movie has shown me the true horror that Jesus went through on the cross for us. When they were beating him, I was shouting out ""Stop!!"" I just wanted it to all end, but it went on like that for so long. I thank Mel Gibson for making this film because it has enabled me to become closer with God and Jesus. I would encourage all who have not seen this film to rent it. It has changed my life for the better, and I hope it will for you too.

Well actually better than that but I did find it virtually impossible to view in one setting -- and I felt the over indulgent abuse could better be served better like in psychologically revetting portrait created by Errol Morris in Standard Operation Procedure.As a Christian I felt the story was biased and disturbing - both elements may make for a good film but again very disturbing and the amount of exposure to pure torture (with the exception of the underwear product placement that seemed to survive while human flesh did not).With the aforementioned criticism intact - it was and is an important film and kudos for Mel Gibson and Picture House for the guts to carry out their vision.,The Passion of the Christ

Jesus represents all of the innocent people that are dying everywhere in the world for the sins and greed of others. By following his thoughts, we can make this world a better place. Even if there is too much blood everywhere, it shows a reality, how it was that time. Crowd of people, as it was shown there, can be really dangerous for the mankind, majority and their will, is not always the right one.

Mel Gibson's attention to detail in the horrors of crucifixion was unparalleled. Mel understood the brutality of the Roman soldiers the callousness and envy of the Jewish priests; He understood Mary's Jesus mother's helplessness; Mel deserves a permanent award for filmmaking for this effort; A viewers only question is 'If this 'film is TRUE I need to make a decision....

My one warning is that it is violent. It shows Jesus being whipped and all the gore happening. It shows the nails being hammered into him and him slowly dying. It doesn't leave out any information. I don't know if it's just the version that I watched, but I saw this movie in a language other than English. It has subtitles (which are great and give you enough time to read them), which I found alright. Overall, this is a recommended Easter movie.

2110,arnie-54,The Only One Saviour,10,30 October 2005,"Hello. This film is excellent portrait of what was necessary for mankind to be saved - to be finally and completely delivered from the powers and rulers of darkness - namely from the dominion of fallen angels led by Satan - fallen archangel, who is the head of every fight, of every battle against God (Who is Love according to Gospel of JK) and against mankind, which God made in His own Image. Jesus Christ was, is and always will be the express image of God. JK revealed to the world the TRUE NATURE OF GOD HIMSELF - He showed us THE PERFECT WILL OF GOD - THE CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. In this film Jesus Christ is presented as the Son of Love, Who is willing to lay down His own life for His friends (for everybody who will ever receive His Love by faith through the Gospel of Himself), He is presented here as a man who suffered horrible and extensive pain, indescribable agony, betrayal (Judas Iskariot, then Peter, then the rest, in fact the whole nation - Israel represented by lawyers and priests - didn't receive Him), false accusations, scourged in the most horrible and sadistic way ever known and crucified by heathens with two criminals. BUT ALL THIS WAS THE DIVINE TRAP FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS DEMONS! BY THE CRUCIFIXION OF Jesus Christ - THE DEVIL AND HIS DEMONS LOST EVERY RIGHT (ALL DOMINION) OVER MANKIND. GOD WAS Successful AGAIN !!! AS IS IN THE GOSPEL OF ST. JOHN 3:16 - FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON (THE SON OF LOVE = Jesus Christ) THAT WHOSOEVER SHALL BELIEVE (!) ON HIM, SHOULD NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE (!) EVERLASTING LIFE (THE NATURE OF GOD HIMSELF). Many thanks to Mel Gibson and his friends for this wonderful movie about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ's last 12 hours of His precious Life here on Earth.See this film. See how Love (Our Creator) in and through His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ treated sin (sinful nature of mankind), devil himself and every demon, see how Love (God The Father) in and through His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ gained the final victory over sin and death.I highly recommend it!

Regardless of your religious views, that fact should be considered when watching the movie.The movie is not about the life of Jesus, but his death. Even though, I wish it would have shown a little more about Jesus to give a better sense of why the violence was so unjustified. The flash-backs, and the images of Mary did a good job though of presenting a personal side of him.The violence is extremely graphic, but that was the point. The nature of crucifixion was so horrible that the Romans would not crucify their own citizens. The point of the movie was to show how horribly Jesus undeservedly suffered, and without the graphic violence it would not have been as successful.",The Passion of the Christ
2112,emmagibson1610,Inspired ...,10,15 December 2005,"A truly brutal portrayal of the last hours of Christ's life (yet this is how the Bible tells us it was) but so well made.I watched it at home on my own and felt that, had I been watching it at the movies, I don't think I could have coped with the subtitles and watching the pictures at the same time, but it was fine on a smaller screen. The Aramaic and Latin gave the film a lot of its appeal for me. I always feel that the story of Christ is never the same in English.It is an extremely emotional piece of cinema. I am quite an emotional person I admit, often crying at films, but this felt different. There were places in this film where I actually felt my heart hurt. For example, when Mary had a flashback of Jesus falling as a child, then rushed to help him up in the present.Very moving and emotional, extremely graphic, quite harrowing, yet strangely peaceful at the same time. It is perhaps just a touch on the long side - another reason I was glad I was in the comfort of my own home rather than in an uncomfortable cinema, but this is to show the duration of Christ's suffering, his ""Passion"", which is really the point of the film.""The Passion of the Christ"" is, in my opinion, one of the best narratives of Christ's final half-day that has ever been produced, with a superb cast.

2115,schizling,Sadistic and ugly,2,4 December 2005,"The film caused enough noise in the media to build up my expectations regarding its quality, acting, usage of the exotic tongues (Latin and Aramaic, and Hebrew in which I'm fluent) etc. I was shocked and appalled, but moreover - surprised. How could such bad acting get such great reviews? How could it be that none of the participants of this movie bothered to make sure they pronounce all of the words correctly or at least fluently? Mel Gibson made a great research on the period - how could the film itself be so... Western? European? The actors' speech is slow and unrealistic, and their entire acting, hence, is over-dramatic. I found it very hard to believe that the Sanhedrin looked like a medieval church, and that the judges appointed there were blue-eyed Hollywood actors who would spit out each word in a thick foreign accent. (Side note: Had Gibson taken some Arabic or Hebrew speakers to take part in this farce of a film, he could have had some REAL Aramaic sounds there). But the most amazing feature of the film is that towards the end, even Gibson himself couldn't resist some good ol' all-American kitsch which I shan't describe, as I don't want to spoil it to those of you who were fortunate enough not to see this necrophiliac, blasphemous feast of blood and gore.",The Passion of the Christ
2116,zspong,Less violence could have made it better,5,8 December 2005,"In his interview with Diane Sawyer, Mel Gibson says of the Passion:""It's about faith, hope, love and forgiveness... This is my version of what happened, according to the Gospels and what I wanted to show - the aspects of it I wanted to show... I wanted it to be shocking. And I also wanted it to be extreme..."" and ""...someone could endure that and still come back with love and forgiveness, even through extreme pain and suffering and ridicule"".And herein lies the problem. The film is the gospel according to Mel Gibson and to assume it is anything more would be a mistake. I had a catholic upbringing and am pretty familiar with the gospels and the crucifixion as told in the gospels. I have also read some of Sister Anne Emmerich's vision of Christ's death and can see where Gibson got the more visceral details for his film, which by the way, are NOT detailed like this in the gospels.In my opinion the film could have had a much greater emotional impact by building more depth into the characters and focusing less on a rather lengthy showing of various beatings. Yes I know the film is about the Passion, the suffering. It shows pain in a very graphic way. My point is that I didn't connect with the character of Jesus enough to really feel the enormity of His suffering. I thought the flashbacks worked well and gave us another view of Jesus. Had there been more exploration of Jesus, His teachings, His wisdom, His life and so on the true horror of His Passion would have had a much greater impact in the film because the viewer might better appreciate just what we all lost when Jesus was crucified. Furthermore, for the non-religious viewers it could have provided a better understanding of why things happened the way they did and why Jesus let them happen.Some good things in the film are: 1) The use of subtle facial gestures particularly from Pontius Pilate and Abenador as well as spectators watching the torture to convey discomfort, revulsion, uncertainty and so on. 2) The use of flashbacks for juxtapositioning, eg. Jesus falling with the cross and Mary's memory of Jesus falling as a child. 3) The remarkably androgynous Satan character tempting Jesus at the start of the film. 4) Jim Caviezel looks really good as Jesus - again more character depth could have had so much more impact! Some bad things about the film: 1) Too much screen time devoted to violence. An old trick used pre special effects was something called ""editing"" and directors were able to convey so much without actually showing much at all. The constant bloodletting in the film is a sad sign of what passes for entertainment in today's mass media. 2) Not enough character development - most of the characters are 2D and the film relies on the assumption that the viewer is familiar with the characters and past events leading up to the arrest of Jesus. 3) Metaphors used in the film like the baby that Satan carries while Jesus is being flogged. I'm sure it meant something but it was lost on me and I'd like to think I'm acquainted enough with the story of Jesus to have figured it out.Overall, there are good and bad things about the Passion. This is Mel Gibson's vision of the crucifixion and he admits he has been influenced by the visceral paintings of Carravaggio and the gory visions of an 18th century nun. I'm not convinced that Gibson achieved his goal of showing that ""someone could endure that and still come back with love and forgiveness"". Less screen time devoted to violence and more time developing the main characters could have made a good film into a great film.",The Passion of the Christ

But I am not an ignorant non-believer, I have studied the bible, historically and exegetically. I believe that the gospels have a great power in them, the tale of an innocent dying for what he believes in is deeply engaging, and touching. And the teachings of Christ as a philosopher incredibly subversive and prevalent.Of course it was ruined by the ignorant babbling 'born-again' script. This film would have been watchable had it kept some of the essence of the gospel, or had not been stupidly violent. Oh, I get realism, but that doesn't excuse stupidity.

I have since purchased the film and viewed it as of last evening. I must say that it is definitely a most compassionate portrayal of Christ's crucifixion. My heart was wrenched, my eyes were not dry... Though some might say that ""The Passion of the Christ"" was extremely violent, I would give answer to them this way. ""Death by scourging, followed by crucifixion is the most violent of deaths."" How could they think, or feel, otherwise? Mr. Gibson followed true to the biblical interpretations in all instances, violent as some might feel.

2119,jiansma,Tremendous Acting By All,9,27 December 2005,"What a tremendous film showing what none other has so closely shown, the WILLING sacrifice of the LORD! I enjoy when Hollywood is rounded out by true actors with theatre background. I am very sorry the actors were not valued before the American Academy, as Maia Morgenstern and the woman portraying Pilate's wife were awesome. I also think the man playing Simon the Cyrene deserved an Oscar nomination! The film gave me an opportunity to put to life something I've only seen on paintings (the Last Supper), or vaguely portrayed in other films. We need more enactments of the Gospels and the Acts. I enjoyed Gibson's Hamlet, but enjoyed the Passion more as it is closer to my heart. It was interesting to see an effeminate, lying, but o, so beautiful former son of the morning! That was a wonderful character twining. I wish it were balanced by the fact that an angel did come and strengthen Jesus too as he prayed. The Roman soldiers showed true character in their sarcasm with one another and with Simon the Cyrene. They were FUNNY (in a drunken, terrible sort of way).As for the film, I did not see it at it's emergence in 2004. Someone told me of a song that came forth out of them after watching it last year and that compelled me to buy the film.I give the film a 9 for the few inaccuracies of the snapping/pulling of Jesus wrist, which is against the scripture of none of his bones being broken. Maybe that doesn't mean broken bones, but it is a little overglorification of violence. Also mixing Mary Magdalene with the woman found in adultery was off. The woman with the cloth on the way to the cross was nice, but it's not recorded that on his way anyone showed kindness to him purposely. I also missed a significant detail, the renting of the veil in the temple. There is a curtain shown as the earthquake hits, but did not catch the very important ripping of that veil in two. As that was ripped, men no longer had to depend on those cruel priests to go into the Holy of Holies for them. We can enter in through the grace of what the Christ did on that day. If what M. Gibson says is true about his own seeking of Christs atonement and love, then the taring of the veil would have significance for him and for others.Very strong portrayals. They were roles that made an impression to last generations. Bravisimos. I appreciate the honor Catholics give to the Blessed Mother. It must have been an honor to think of portraying her in some way. Thanks to Maia Morgenstern for bringing a mother's love to life, even to suffering. I went with my son through the hospital and every test I was allowed in. It is a sword through the heart, but sometimes would cost too much NOT to be there for our children.",The Passion of the Christ
2120,say_whuut,If you can stomach it,8,30 December 2005,"This movie can be summed up in three words, although not meant to be judging the film with distaste, there is one thing that is plainly evident, it is: Braveheart with Jesus.This film however is not bad, far from it, in fact it portrays such a vivid and realistic image of Jesus, a Jew, not blonde haired and blue eyed, but a true middle eastern man. The use of Aramaic is incredible & the style of filmography is dark and somber. However, I am not here to waste anyone's free time by having them read the same review, the move cannot be scripted into good or bad by most any person, and, if one is lucky enough to make up their mind one way or the other, is really up to the individual viewer to make up their mind about it because this film has a way of running your mind around in circles.",The Passion of the Christ
2121,daniyel-1,If you like to watch people die...,2,13 March 2006,"I liked that the actors spoke the original language, because it feels more like Israel 2000 years ago. What I did not like at all was the rest of the movie. Where is the point in all those tortures? Besides, in the Bible they didn't write that Jesus claimed to be 'God's Son'. I mean, of course Jesus WAS tortured and maybe the way they arranged it, but I don't think it makes any difference if you can image or not, or if you ever think about him being crucified. He sacrificed himself for the people who believed in him. That's all you need to know. I don't want to know how much blood he lost, or what instruments they used to cause him this immense pain. Who cares? Face it: If it was less brutal, no one would have watched it.",The Passion of the Christ
2122,krj_2005,The Passion of the Christ,1,26 February 2006,"I skipped several scenes through to the end. It was not the violence nor their brutality that stunned me but the mere fact that such a great story of such a great Man could be reduced to a graphical display.His name evokes far more than the Calvary this film claims to portrait. It is not his suffering per se that makes Him the greatest of all of men. It was his teachings, his message of hope, of the existence of a Supreme Being and of eternal life that brought our respect for him.This film only reflects the days we live in, when graphical images seem to be more important than faith itself.If that was what Mel Gibson tried to prove, he definitely made his point.Kleber",The Passion of the Christ
2123,ppounds,A wonderful adaptation of scripture to film,10,8 August 2006,"It is not perfect, but Passion of The Christ is a well filmed adaptation of the Holy Word. Through all the controversy surrounding this film, it amazingly triumphed at the box office. There were some calling it an anti-Semitic film before they had even seen it. As a Christian, I don't understand why so many in the Jewish faith believe that Christians blame Jews for Christ's death and the whole reason Mel Gibson did this film was to make Jews look bad. Jesus Christ was a Jew and also the Son of God who came to establish a new covenant with Jew and Gentile alike so that we may be able to fellowship with the Father in heaven and not perish in sin. What He did was an act of love for all humanity. He reached out to his creation and sacrificed His own son to save us from our chosen destruction. After reading so many negative comments about how horrible this film is, that it is too gory, anti-Semitic, and that it is not based on fact or scripture leads me to believe that these people are not familiar with scripture and do not understand its meaning. In other words, they are not Christians in obedience with God and therefore can not possibly understand what God means without the help of the Holy Spirit. This is a choice we all have to make. I chose God's way, not my way. He made the first move and reached out to all of us. This is not an action/adventure film, romantic/comedy, sci-fi, it is what it is, so don't get out the popcorn. It is a film demonstrating God's passion for humanity which can only be truly appreciated by those who have accepted God's gift and are obedient. Mel Gibson got a lot of bad flack about this film and risked his career, spending his own money because nobody in Hollywood would touch it. Out of all the garbage that comes out of Hollywood, leave it to Jesus and His love for humanity to stir up the most controversy. After all, that is the way it has been since the beginning of His ministry. A huge thanks to Mel Gibson for taking a chance in faith and providing a masterpiece to be revered and loved in an industry so full of hate.",The Passion of the Christ

2125,jake0656,"2 1/2 hours of blood, screaming, and suck",1,28 May 2007,"this movie sucked.. it was 2 1/2 hours of some guy getting tortured.. it was worst than hostel and turistas put together.... Mel Gibson sucks.... if you like this movie than you really don't have a soul!!! If i wanted to watch a gory movie i would of rented saw, this movie didn't convey any message. Everyone already knows the story of Jesus, and people should take away the lessons he taught rather than how he was killed. This movie was worse than baby geniuses 2.. and thats really bad. However Jim Caviezel is a great actor but just picked this part poorly. Mel Gibson just proved to only be decent as an actor. If you wanna see a good Mel Gibson movie go watch Braveheart, where Jesus Christ is your lord and savior or not, this movie blows.",The Passion of the Christ

2127,soxfan0602,"Good film, careless in its delivery",6,14 April 2006,"To cover the common criticism of this movie's anti-Semitism, I'd like to give my perspective on the matter. The movie is neither blatantly anti-Semitic nor hateful towards only the Jews in the film, rather it bashes everyone is even mildly opposed to Christ. Therefore, it is not exclusive in its negative portrayal of certain groups, which is honorable. However, Gibson likely did not consider or care to consider the statements he was making by having Jewish people condemn Jesus to death as he does in this film. There are four or so different teachings as to how Jesus was condemned, the Jewish people's direct involvement being only part of one of them. Thus, Gibson surprisingly chose this teaching without thinking about its possible repercussion.Also, Gibson's depiction of Pontius Pilate is slightly skewed. He is seen in the film as a reflective, emotional, and heartfelt man who does everything possible to avoid the crucifixion of Christ. However, historically, Pilate is described by many historians to be the most ruthless and unsympathetic ruler in Roman history and who likely crucified the most people on any ruler in his time. The idea of him being so kind and reflective makes everyone else, including the Jewish mob, look worse tenfold. In the end, the movie shows well the gruesome nature of Christ's killing and honors the man quite well. While it is extremely violent, the violence helps convey the greatness of this man who many call their savior. It's a good film, but on the subject of anti-Semitism, the director was a bit careless.",The Passion of the Christ
2128,julydoc03,"What better way to tell the story of God's love for us, than the Crucifixion story.",10,17 January 2006,"What a better way to show people, Christian and non-Christian, what our Lord Jesus went through, so that we could be saved and have eternal life. To know that God loves me so much that he sent his only Son to die so that I could understand and see his marvelous love, it just astounds me. No one could ever love any one so much. Christianity is about God's love but the only way that we can see God's love is to accept that Jesus went through all that horrible pain and suffering because he loves me and you so much that he wants to spend eternity with us. It moved me very much. I hope that those of you who have seen it have come closer to God and those of you who have not seen it, please watch it. God's love is for everyone, young and old, sinner and saint.",The Passion of the Christ
2129,neonet7,Excellent Film,8,21 April 2006,"A realistic portrayal of the last 12 days of Christ. Deep, Gory and entertaining. Well Worth Watching. I liked the way the film showed Judas betraying Jesus & the guilt he then has to carry. The Scourging (Beating with cane's, spiked whips)& crucifixion are truly horrifying & not for the faint hearted. These parts of the film show how terrifying the ordeal Christ had to go through. This film & the images that are used will remain with me forever. A must see.The other actors & scenery seem authentic - especially the Romans etc. However there is very little dialogue, which I found slightly annoying, however this does not take anything away from the film, it would have helped possibly explain the story to anyone who doesn't know it exactly.",The Passion of the Christ

2131,ksandra6000,tacky violence does not make a good movie...,3,13 February 2006,"Although a magnificent display of moving images, ""The passion of the Christ"" is not what I would call a important contribution to the World's cinematic heritage. The violent maiming of Jesus did not illustrate anything but massacre, nor did it give much inspiration, it just woke a sense of terrible disgust at the sight of the industrial quantities of ketchup that filled the set. The scene that, in my opinion, gave it the coup de grace was the horrifying ""flagrum"" scene of epic proportion, in which poor Jesus suffered a cruel beating which stripped him consecutively of clothes, skin, bits of flesh and Mel Gibson of his last bit of dignity. I must also admit that there was a scene in the movie that was truly touching, this being the dream/flashback discussion between mother and son. Sadly, this is but a drop in the ocean of tacky Wes Craven props...(approximatively 0.1% of the entire film). Speaking entirely for myself, I'm just not very impressed by all the Latin/Hebrew/Aramaic dialogue. It must have been hard work to caugh up a whole story in some of the deadest languages around, but this alone does not make the movie any good. It's truly sad to see so much good acting wasted on this movie, which is (for me) not only a non-enjoyable experience, but a exhaustingly boring one too. I did not mean to offend anyone or any religious group with this comment, and I truthfully state that my intentions are only of personal nature and are not representing the beliefs of any religious group whatsoever.",The Passion of the Christ
2132,timokalevi,clear visualization of basic moments behind our Judeo-Christian culture,10,11 March 2006,"As a second generation Zionism minded Christian my mind was biased to detect suspicious signs of hatred raised up against Jewish people.But I didn't find any.The first detail which delighted me was the sound of Aramaic language.It was like music for me who prefers reading Bible in Hebrew.I almost understood it. The film followed meticulously the guidelines given the verse of Isaiah telling about the suffering servant of God and how it was fulfilled as a historical event, focusing only to the last 24 hours before the servant's death as was proclaimed on the poster verse from Isaiah in the beginning of the film.A couple weeks earlier I had seen the document about Saddam's two sons organized torture procedures where a man was flogged to death.It was disgusting and very difficult look at. In Mel Gibson's work although it was not easy to follow the long lasting suffering visualized in details the feeling was different from the document of Saddam's regime.Gibson had really made a thorough search about the Roman jurisdiction in detail. This aspiration to the truth combined with creative visioning made this painful event possible to follow.I have read from Jewish sources about the detailed procedures which were in use when the first taxation linked to the birth of Jesus told by St.Luke took place in Caesar Augustus regimen.Taxation meant that the Roman tax officers with aid of those trained torturers we saw doing their job in the film filled the lists of one's ownership.Compelled with racks the people were made confess the contents of their belongings what the rulers dictated. As a prevailing background atmosphere which makes us understand why so definitely just toward the Jewish people the Roman attitudes were even more grisly than to other conquered nations is this nation's irresistible yearning for freedom which took shape in revolts against the conquerors.Another phenomenon at the background is the bitter envy of Romans of the Jewish capitol Jerusalem in its beauty.Josefus describes in his Jewish Wars how these two capitols, both raised on seven hills, were the two most beautiful towns on earth. The beauty of Jerusalem was centered around the temple. I was delighted how in the film even something about the the beauty of Jerusalem was conveyed to the spectator.One way it was mirrored were the glorious but stylish garments of Jewish priests and noble ones in contrast to the stern looking uniforms of the Roman officers.Our young generation is more able than we old ones to read visual images. Very few of them read the Bible. Perhaps they however can now grasp this world better when they have within their reach this film, which focuses to those 24 hours which form the hinge around which our Judeo-Christian culture swings.",The Passion of the Christ
2133,boris33763,Something they won't tell you,10,23 February 2006,"In spite of all the hatred spewing out from Christianphobes, Christian-haters, and other poor souls, this is a great movie. So great, this is a trivia that no liberal media outlet wants to talk about: ""Because of their experiences during film production, many of the cast and filming crew converted to Catholicism after the completion of the film. Among those who converted was an atheist who played Judas Iscariot."" We need more movies like The Passion of the Christ. The movie is filled with a lot of subtle details that provide a ""backstory"" of Jesus. For example, He talks in Arameic, but when Pilate questions Him in Latin, He responds in Latin. Also, the intent to ""reduce"" His Passion to a mere ""tale"" as someone wrote on the critic is just ludicrous. His life is a true and historical event, and no matter how much liberals, atheists, homosexuals, abortionists, and other poor souls shout, yell, mock, deny, distort, curse, cuss, damn, swear, disgrace, the Son of God came to Earth to save us all. Thus we say: We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father; through him all things were made. For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven, was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became truly human. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end.",The Passion of the Christ
2134,nathnathaniel10,Comments on Movie,4,6 March 2006,"If you want to be Christian, that's cool, but Jews and Christians are friends today and I think it isn't a great idea to make a movie focusing on the death of Christ. The movie should have been made to be about the teachings of Christianity. Mel Gibson, you're one of my favorite actors, but I think this movie wasn't a great accomplishment. I will say this movie was well made, but it now seems that it's turning more Christians against Jews. Some kids are calling me a stupid Jew. I am not writing any of this to offend Christians, but we all know what happened back then and those were the Dark Ages. Now Christians and Jews get along. Thank you for letting me write this. P.S. Mel Gibson was grand in The Patriot. Thank you.",The Passion of the Christ
