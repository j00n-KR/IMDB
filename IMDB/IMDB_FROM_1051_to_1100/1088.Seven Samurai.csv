0,MartinHafer,One of Kurosawa's best,9,2 August 2007,"While this movie is probably the most widely recognized film of the director Kurosawa, it isn't my personal favorite--though it's close. But considering how many wonderful films he made and how this movie sparked the Magnificent Seven films, its impact and importance can't be ignored. And I would have to say that it deserves all the attention--it's just too bad that other films like YOJIMBO, SANJURO and THE BAD SLEEP WELL just haven't gotten all the attention this film has. Actually, it['s strange that I am getting around to reviewing this film now--as I have seen it several times and thought I'd already reviewed it.The film begins in the feudal period in Japan in a small town that is being terrorized by a gang. These thugs periodically come to strip the people of what little they have as well as their dignity--much like locusts. Eventually, the gang's demands are so extreme that it appears they have no choice but to fight back when they next return--otherwise they face starvation. The problem is that these are simple peasants and they haven't got a prayer against Ronin (i.e., samurai who have no master). Eventually, townspeople get the idea to bring in some of their own Ronin to fight against the evil gang. At this point, the film concentrates on the seven men--who they are, their motivations, etc. It is here that the film really excels. In fact, probably the least exciting portion of the film is the eventual battle between the forces.An excellent character study and a film with so much to love--great acting, direction and a dandy and exciting script.",Seven Samurai
1,TheLittleSongbird,Kurasawa's best film,10,9 June 2012,"As much as I do love Ran, The Hidden Fortress and Throne of Blood, it was Seven Samurai that I love most of Akira Kurasawa's films. As with all Kurasawa's films, it is incredibly well made with authentic scenery that would give meaning to the term epic and the camera work is truly spectacular. This is especially true in the final battle, with inspired use of moving and multiple camera, precise editing, telephoto lenses and variegated film speeds. As always with Kurasawa, the direction is consistently brilliant. Add to that a stirring score from Fumio Hayasaka and a thoughtful script and you have more reasons why Seven Samurai is so good. The story unfolds slowly, but never felt dull to me and is never hampered by the three-and-a-half-hour running time. Plus Seven Samurai is interesting for being one of the first few to utilise the plot element of recruiting/gathering of heroes into a team to achieve a goal, seen especially with when the audience is first introduced Kambei. The action is spectacular and looks even better with the use of multiple cameras from various angles, and any humanity Seven Samurai has, and it does have a lot, is shown in a poignant way. The cast are excellent, with Takashi Shimura and especially Toshiro Mifune the standouts. Overall, of a resume of one of the greatest directors who ever lived, responsible for many wonderful movies(and I'd say that Seven Samurai and Ran are among the best movies ever made) Seven Samurai stands tall. One of the easiest 10/10s I've ever given. Bethany Cox",Seven Samurai
2,Leofwine_draca,"A strong, expertly-made, and influential movie",8,13 December 2016,"This Japanese samurai film from Akira Kurosawa sets up a classic action template that would inspire everything from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN to THE SEVEN MAGNIFICENT GLADIATORS and utilises the style of camera-work and direction that would inspire Hollywood movies till this day. Be warned, at three hours and ten minutes, this is a leisurely-paced film that takes its time to get to know the leading characters, and many fans of the type of slickly-edited, no-attention-span blockbusters that are made these days will find themselves struggling to sit through the film in one go. However, perseverance is worthwhile, because SEVEN SAMURAI is a very well made film despite the low budget. The direction and camera-work, as mentioned previously, are spot on and Kurosawa reveals himself at home both in the crisply-shot action sequences and the character-fuelled drama.Another big plus for the film is the cast, all of whom really add to the movie experience as a whole. Best of all is Takashi Shimura as Shimada, the chief samurai; taciturn yet friendly, strong yet understanding, he gives an outstanding performance. Shimada's character is off-set by Toshiro Mifune's Kikuchiyo, who has more of a scene-stealing part as a farmer's-son-turned-samurai; Mifune brings vitality and humour to the movie and, while I'm sure his gurning and frenzied comedy will not be to all tastes, he certainly ups the excitement and fun of the film whenever he's around. The supporting characters are also great, especially the stern Kyuzo and the youngster of the seven, Katsushiro.The plot is simple yet is strong enough to have been rehashed countless times. Elements of battle tactics and warfare are used sparingly but effectively, and the emotional punch is there; at the closing scenes, I felt like crying right along with Katsushiro, due to all the unnecessary bloodshed and killing that immediately preceded that moment. SEVEN SAMURAI is best experienced by watching it appreciatively; of course it looks dated nowadays, and many of the plot elements have become clichéd. Appreciating what it did to cinema in 1954, though, reveals what a strong, expertly-made and influential movie it really is.",Seven Samurai
3,SnoopyStyle,Iconic influential movie,9,10 December 2014,"It's early 16th century and Japan is in the midst of civil wars. A poor village faces constant harassment from bandits. A villager overhears that bandits are planning to come back after the harvest. After a debate, the village elder proposes to hire samurai. The villagers have little to offer. They witness heroic ronin Kambei rescue a boy. Young Katsushirō is desperate to be his disciple. Kambei reluctantly agrees to help the villagers but he determines that the defense needs at least seven samurai.This is simply one of the best movies ever. It is influential in so many other movies. The characters are funny and compelling. They are iconic in their simple characteristics. Modern audiences may find the over 3 hour running time a bit too long.",Seven Samurai
4,Hitchcoc,It Helped Define Film,10,2 September 2009,"This is a movie that makes over three hours seem like a few minutes. As with a great work of art, it appreciates on multiple viewings. This is a classic tale of an oppressed village under siege from enemies. They are plundered and attacked by murderous thieves and have little hope. Enter the good guys who aren't always seen as good guys. Yes, it is a classic plot, but there the comparison ends. The way Kurosawa frames his scenes, the action sequences, the close ups, the emotions expressed are seldom matched. This has everything: a massive spectacle with battle scenes unmatched, incredible acting by Kurosawa's stable, including his star Taoshiro Mifune. In the ""High Noon"" tradition, it has the theme that we need to help ourselves and not depend on others to help us. The Samurai, who have ruled for a long time, have fallen into disfavor and so there's a tension: Why should they fight if the villagers are only interested in keeping what is there's, even if it means constant raids and attacks. There are greater reviewers who have done justice to this film. I can only say that I am a huge fan.",Seven Samurai
5,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Movies of Cinema History,10,2 August 2009,"In the Sixteenth Century, in Japan, a poor village is frequently looted by armed bandits losing their crop of rice. Their patriarch Grandpa advises the villagers to hire a Ronin to defend their village. Four farmers head to town to seek out their possible protectors, but they just can offer three meals of rice per day and lodging for the samurai. They succeed in hiring the warming-hearted veteran Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) that advises that they need six other samurai to protect their lands. Kambei recruits the necessary five samurai and the brave jester Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune) and move to the village. After a feared reception, Kambei plots a defense strategy and the samurai start training the farmers how to defend their lands and families for the battle that approaches. In order to celebrate the milestone of 4,000 reviews in IMDb, I decided to watch again ""The Seven Samurai"", the most known masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa and among my Top-10 movies ever. As far as I recall, this was the first samurai movie that I have watched and it is still my favorite despite many other excellent movies. ""The Seven Samurai"" is a perfect movie: the story and screenplay are amazing, dividing the dramatic story in the recruitment, reception, strategy, training, harvest, romance and the final battle of the samurai in such a way that the viewer does not feel the 207 minutes running time. The direction of Akira Kurosawa is perfectionist as usual, and the choreography of the battle in the rain is extremely realistic. The acting is top-notch, highlighting Toshirô Mifune in a great shape, climbing trees, jumping and fighting in the role of a funny character. The cinematography, set decoration, costumes, lighting, everything is fantastic. In 1960, John Sturges remade this masterpiece with the western ""The Magnificent Seven"". My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Os 7 Samurais"" (""The 7 Samurai"")",Seven Samurai
6,classicsoncall,"""In life one finds friends in the strangest places.""",10,15 August 2014,"Apparently it took a second viewing for me to really appreciate this film. The first time around I must have been distracted to the point of being inattentive and today I'm glad I gave it another shot. What particularly struck me this time was the gorgeous cinematography, which hooks you right from the start with the menacing ride of the bandit clan upon the seemingly deserted village. Though filmed in black and white, the images are crisp and clean, elevating the result to a true work of art. In fact, the effect is hypnotic at times, and one must concentrate to stay with the story that unfolds.Thinking back on my first experience with the picture, I tried to figure out what might have prevented my viewing pleasure. Yes the film is long and there is a tendency for Kurosawa to keep the camera stationary for an inordinate length of time to establish mood and a point of view. Perhaps it also had something to do with the motion of the villagers who appear to react erratically, almost as if they were self consciously forcing their activity. Now obviously those elements have not gone away, but it's just that I saw it all in a different light with this viewing.Director Kurosawa does take his time building to the action. The entire first half of the film is used to introduce his characters and set up the framework for defending the village. When the village is finally assaulted by the marauding bandits, the samurai follow a methodical plan devised by their leader Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura), whereby one or two of the outlaws are allowed entry into the village while the rest are kept at bay, allowing the villagers to defeat their foes systematically and decisively. The villagers resemble a swarm of bees each time they descend on a fallen enemy.Through a diverse mix of personalities and temperaments, Kurosawa explores various character traits of the samurai, among them honor, loyalty, selflessness, courage and even humor. The comic relief offered by Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune) when attempting to ride the horse for the first time came just at the right moment to break the unrelenting tension faced by the warriors. Kurosawa even delves into matters of the heart with the relationship of Katsushiro and Shino, unfavorably received by the obsessive behavior of Shino's father.All in all, I'm glad I gave this picture a second chance. ""Seven Samurai"" is a masterfully told story and a cinematic achievement, and will certainly warrant another viewing in due course.",Seven Samurai
7,gavin6942,A Truly Epic Film,8,31 March 2010,"A village has been hounded by bandits who come in to steal their rice and barley. Sick of it, they decide to hire a samurai to protect them before the next raid. Soon, the number grows to seven... and the bandits have a heck of fight on their hands.Akira Kurosawa is a master, both in writing and directing. Some have compared this film to Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" for its greatness. And surely, we have seen many, many directors and films who have expressed their admiration -- sometimes in words, sometimes by imitation.The film has been said to be the first where an assembled group of men go on a mission. That may well be true. I find it even more impressive that Kurosawa was able to make such a production so relatively soon after World War II, when Japan should have been struggling with recovery. Indeed, the filming quality is not up to American standards for 1954, but he more than makes due with what he has.I really need to see the film again to get a fair assessment of it, but I enjoyed it greatly and think it needs more exposure.",Seven Samurai
8,jboothmillard,Seven Samurai,9,8 December 2010,"I read the description of this film given in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was surprised to find out that it was remade into The Magnificent Seven, so naturally I wanted to see the original source, from director Akira Kurosawa. Basically, set in the 16th Century of Japan, a poor mountain village in the country is constantly being robbed, looted and made fearful by an armed gang of marauding bandits causing them to lose their rice crop. The villagers have finally had enough and decide that they need outside help to both defend themselves, and get rid of the thieves once and for all. Warm-hearted veteran samurai Kambei Shimada (BAFTA nominated Takashi Shimura) is approached by young samurai Katsushirô Okamoto (Isao Kimura)to be hired to defend the village, and he gladly accepts. Together, along with two of the town's farmers, under the advice of Kambei, they leave the village to find six other samurai warriors to protect the lands. They successfully find and recruit four skilled fighters and swordsmen, Gorōbei Katayama (Yoshio Inaba), Shichirôji (Daisuke Katô), Heihachi Hayashida (Minoru Chiaki) and Kyûzô (Seiji Miyaguchi). They had originally planned to leave with just these four men, but they spot clownish but skilled samurai Kikuchiyō Okamoto (BAFTA nominated Toshirô Mifune), and with everyone's encouragement, Katsushirô is secured as the seventh samurai. With the promise of three free meals a day the seven samurai look forward to their arrivals, but when they get back to the village with a fearful reception, but don't worry, things settle. Kambei gets to work immediately on the battle strategy against the gang of thieves, and the other samurai start training the people in the village to be ready for any incoming attack or raid. There are forty bandits in total, and the first attack gets underway, with a good amount of the opposite side being brought down, but of course there has to be a casualty. Gorōbei was shot and killed in the first attack, Kikuchiyo's friend Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari) was also killed in action, but the samurai and villagers are determined not to be beaten in the second bandit brawl. Kyûzô suffered the fate of the second attack, and the final attack finishes off the gang of thieves, with Kikuchiyō being the final samurai to meet their maker. In the end, the three surviving samurai, Kambei, Katsushirô and Shichirôji look over the villagers looking happy planting their new crop, and the graves of the other four warriors. Also starring Kamatari Fujiwara as Manzô, Yoshio Tsuchiya as Rikichi and Yoshio Kosugi as Mosuke. Being three hours and ten minutes long I was expecting to doze off and have to rewind at some point, but with great acting, the training and fight sequences, historical detail, humanism, the final battles, but also clever editing and speed techniques, this black and white is a masterpiece of foreign cinema, a brilliant classic action drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!",Seven Samurai
9,ccthemovieman-1,Not What It Is Cracked Up To Be,3,22 July 2006,"This 1954 Akiro Kuroswa-directed film has legendary status among critics. It was the forerunner for the western hit ""The Magnificent Seven.""Knowing these facts, I was anxious to see it. Wow, what a letdown! Yes, it had some nice photography but the story was way too slow-moving to sustain interest. It took FOREVER to get to the main action scene. By then, it was too late; I had lost interest. The film runs 160 minutes and can seem longer.So many of these Kurosawa films are overrated by the critics. Maybe it's not politically-correct to criticize this man's work, it's not the ""thing to do,"" so they keep telling everyone what great films like this are, hooking unsuspecting people like me into wasting my time and money on them..I wanted to like this, but I have to be honest, too. If you thinking of purchasing this, sight-unseen (especially with an expensive Criterion price) , don't say I didn't warn you.",Seven Samurai
10,ma-cortes,"Classic epic ,though overlong , Kurosawa's masterpiece and at the time it was Japan's most expensive picture ever",7,27 February 2019,"This is a superior and enduringly popular film , considered to be a real classical movie .The film gets action in Western style , thrills , intrigue , human relationships , it's fun and entertaining . Kurosawa's vintage pic set in 16th century Japan , a small farming village beset by marauding attackers hires 7 professional Samurai to rid of the scourge. As a group of villagers go to the nearly town where find Kambei : Takashi Shimura , who has carried out a risked rescue of a baby taken hostage by a nasty bandit . As Kambei walks towards town a young samurai, Katsushiro : Kimura , asks to become his acolyte. Then the farmers ask Kambei to help defend their village; to their great joy, he accepts. Kambei, with Katsushiro's assistance, then enlists four samurai more from the city, . Kambei initially decides that seven masterless samurai , Ronin , would be necessary to recruit , and time is running short . The villagers beg him to take Katsushiro also and, with some prodding by the others, he agrees . A clownish samurai named Kikuchiyo : Toshirô Mifune , whom Kambei had rejected for the mission, follows them to the village at a distance , ignoring their protestations and attempts to drive him away. The team gradually come together and 7 Samurai , at last , one by one, each with distinctive skills and personality traits ; all of them to help a poor village against savage thieves .As Kambei and his buddies , each of whom comes for a different reason , must free a village attacked by heinous outlaws who are devastating the small location . All of them get a chance to redeem themselves . Later on , the bunch develops a plan to secure the villagers defend it against enemy attack .This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actors Toshiro Mifune , and Takashi Shimura , being his international breakthrough one . Sweeping , dramatic , complex human drama with all the ingredients : suspense , action , comedy , character studio and many other things . Seven Samurai , the picture blends drama , violent fights , emotion , slaughters with high body-count and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought-provoking . It is incredibly detailed vision in its own right , as the impact of the action and combats on this trail-blazing adventure film opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films and subsequent Spaghetti Westerns that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . Dramatically staged sword-plays occur on and off throughout the plot . The story is classic and traditional , following its interesting premise in subsequent remakes , rif-offs and sequels , including customary misfit band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse characters as well as speciality . Kurosawa took an elemental Western issue ¨good guys against bad guys¨ plot and turned it into a breathtaking classy which is still probably the best-know and one best Samurai film to come from Japan . At the time of its making it got a big success at the boxoffice around the world . Kurosawa's pacing is immaculate and allows for periods of calm in which to establish roles punctuated by viscerally thrilling burst of action . These culminate in the overwhelming climatic battle between the bandits and the samurai which ranks among the very nicest combat scenes ever put on movie . It is followed by several reboots and imitations . Standing out ¨The magnificent seven¨ by John Sturges . Unlike Sturges' remake in 7 Samurai the roles grow originally from the action and they are not conveniently established by star-casting , like in the American film formed by big actors as Yul Brynner , Charles Bronson , James Coburn , Robert Vaughn , Brad Dexter , Elli Wallach . Very good acting by Toshiro Mifune as a valiant Samurai , as he is a harebrained but courageous young dominating warrior , as well as Takashi Shimura as the intelligent and brave leader of the fabulous Samurai . This one made an international star out of Toshiro Mifune .This fiercely-charging , uncompromising picture was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa and being exhibited with subtitles or dubbed .After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this awesome film . And available in a big number of versions of varying length , all too long . Kurosawa's previous and subsequent years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , this great epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to Medieval Japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , and Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the ""Best Foreign Film"" category. When this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . Rashomon won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West.Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . Other important movies were : The idiot based on Feodor Dostowieski , Drunken Angel , Scandal , A quiet duel , Tiger's tale , High and low . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) and Rhapsody in August . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by American and European film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well , a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais (1954), as The magnificent seven (1960),The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars (1977)as Yojimbo (1961) as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone (1964), in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre ; as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy . Rating : 7.7/10 . Better than average . Well worth watching .",Seven Samurai
11,Quinoa1984,Kurosawa's triumphant epic- totally & successfully driven by character and story,10,7 December 2003,"Akira Kurosawa was and is considered the master of east-western film-making (in that he made his Japanese films accessible for fans of American westerns while still making the movies his country found popular), and out of the few Kurosawa movies I've had the pleasure of viewing (Hidden Fortress, Rashomon, and this) I'd have to say that while Rashomon is still my favorite, I nevertheless had a blast during this one. The story has become quite influential to filmmakers from the likes of John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) to John Lasseter (A Bug's Life): a small village has been terrorized by bandits for far too long, amid times of civil war in the nation, and so on the advice of Grand-Dad, they decide to hire four - which soon becomes seven - samurai for the job. There's no money, just food and honor, even though the village isn't exactly pleased to have samurai back in their village. Each character is drawn and executed compellingly, though for my money Toshiro Mifune proves why he became one of Japan's most notorious film actors. His work as the brave, bold outcast of the seven is awe-inspiring practically all the way through, like the hero of a western that anyone can root for since he's a true rebel at heart within a group of men with a task at hand. Kurosawa directs his tale and main and supporting players like a grand composer, orchestrating a vivid story and extracting from great actors like Takashi Shimura (the old, wise Samurai), Ko Kimura (the disciple Samurai), Daisuke Kato (Schichiroji), and Mifune (Kikuchiyo, which isn't his real name) just the right touches of humanity, humor, tragedy, romance, and intensity. The overall intensity, by the way, isn't over-estimated; its long length (almost 3 1/2 hours) isn't distracting in the slightest since Kurosawa's editing and photography (the later helmed by Asakazu Nakai) are extraordinary. Not to compare the two films, but one thing I saw in common with Seven Samurai and a Lord of the Rings film is that, if anything else, it definitely isn't a boring experience. Along with a score by Fumio Hayasaka that gives the film just a bit more of a pulse, and a showdown that is relentless with excitement, this is one of the must-see action films for film buffs, or anyone with an serious interest in having fun with an epic.",Seven Samurai
12,sunwarrior13,Kurosawa Finest Masterpiece,10,17 January 2012,"Akira Kurosawa's epic tale concerns honor and duty during a time when the old traditional order is breaking down.Seven Samurai is a 1954 Japanese adventure drama film co-written, edited, and directed by Kurosawa. The film takes place in 1587 during the Warring States Period of Japan. It follows the story of a village of farmers that hire seven masterless samurai to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops. The film is described as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and is one of a select few Japanese films to become widely known in the West for an extended period of time. It is the subject of both popular and critical acclaim.The film opens with master samurai Kambei posing as a monk to save a kidnapped farmer's child. Impressed by his selflessness and bravery, a group of farmers begs him to defend their terrorized village from bandits. Kambei agrees, although there is no material gain or honor to be had in the endeavor. Soon he attracts a pair of followers: a young samurai named Katsushiro, who quickly becomes Kambei's disciple, and boisterous Kikuchiyo, who poses as a samurai but is later revealed to be the son of a farmer. Kambei assembles four other samurais, including Kyuzo, a master swordsman, to round out the group. Together they consolidate the village's defenses and shape the villagers into a militia, while the bandits loom menacingly nearby. Soon raids and counter-raids build to a final bloody heart-wrenching battle.Arguably the most influential epic ever made, Kurosawa's 1954 film is a veritable textbook on how to shoot, cut, frame and present violence on screen; Sergio Leone, Arthur Penn, Sam Peckinpah, Michael Mann and many others owe huge debut to the master for he has loaded his film with unusual and exciting physical incidents and made the whole thing graphic in a hard, realistic western style.Arguably his finest masterpiece,The Seven Samurai is an epic adventure classic with an engrossing story, memorable characters, and stunning action sequences that make it one of the most influential films ever made.It is required viewing for everyone who loves great films.",Seven Samurai
13,CinemaSerf,Outstanding!,8,19 September 2021,"Set in an 16th century Japanese village, this film depicts the struggle of it's peasant farmers trying to fight off a ruthless gang of bandits who persistently rob and abuse them. It's soon clear that they just haven't the wherewithal to resist effectively, so they set about trying to hire a few Ronin to assist them... Thing is, they have no money - all they can really offer is basic bed and board. Fortunately, they encounter the wise and kindly ""Kambei Shimada"" (Takashi Shimura) who offers not only to help, but to recruit a few other samurai for their task. Foremost amongst them is the unpredictable ""Kikuchiyo"" (Tishorô Mifune) - a man of humble beginnings himself, but now one strong and principled - if a bit of a loose cannon!. Now this band of wandering samurai must try to impart some basic defensive skills to the villagers and prepare for the next attack... Kurosawa and his formidably creative cinematographer Asakuzu Nakai set about cleverly drawing us into the story - using the terrain, the weather, the dark and shadow to create an authentic scenario and build the tension grippingly as the final conflict looms. The plot and the sparse, but potent dialogue, help to develop the characters with depth and personality leaving us in little doubt as to whom are the cowards and the brave, the clever and the meek - and not just amongst the villagers. The score from Fumio Hayasaka is also really complimentary to the overall delivery of this vastly superior adventure story that whilst certainly about good versus evil, is about so much more of an evaluation of human nature.

It certainly is one of the greatest of all times.Everyone is familiar with the approaching band of riders coming into view as they crest a hilltop. This is the first film in which it was used.This is the first modern action movie. Certain elements in this movie are banded together for the first time by Kurosawa to produce a film that is brilliant in it's cinematography and costuming and sets.Sure, it's long at over three hours, but that gives us time to really get to know the characters and feel pain when they die. Unlike it's successor, The Magnificent Seven, the motivations of the samurai are not clear, and we are left to surmise why they would take a job that pays nothing. That is the magic of this film.It certainly belongs in the queue of anyone that calls themselves a movie lover.",Seven Samurai

It perfectly mixes all the action movie elements we are familiar with these this days in movies.But still its not the action I'll remember this movie by. I'll remember the movie for its wonderful and heroic story and top-notch characters. For me it truly were the characters that made the movie. Every characters has its own fun strong personality. My personal favorite character was Kyuzo played by Seiji Miyaguchi, he simply is one of those characters I always love in movies. Heroic, extremely specialized, without fear and many emotions but he doesn't have a prominent role or many lines. For some odd reason he really reminded me of Capt. Speirs from ""Band of Brothters"".The cinematography and editing are good. Even though the movie is almost three and a halve hour long, it doesn't feel like it, due to a pleasant pace and story that never gets dull even though there are some slow moments in the movie, I mean basically it isn't until the ending till the first real action starts.Also impressive are the costumes and the set decoration. The nice little musical score suits the movie well and is only used in the right places. The final showdown also ain't a disappointment although the sword fights and all are pretty lame, especially compared to movies made present day of course.A highly enjoyable action movie with heroic characters and a wonderful story, with multiple layers in it.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Seven Samurai
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"An amazing piece of film, but the length alone will discourage many possible viewers",9,12 November 2004,"I haven't seen any of Akira Kurosawa's other films, but I hear that this is his best, so maybe that's a good place to start(and maybe not). From the very first frame I was captivated by this film, and very interested in it. Then after about five minutes of watching, I realized how slow it was moving; ""Fine,"" I thought, ""it'll probably pick up later on"". But it didn't. The film stays in the same uncompromisingly slow pace for the entire runtime which is about three hours(more or less, depending on which cut/version you see). That's OK, don't get me wrong, but it brings the movie down. The film is epic, and truly astounding. It's a shame that it's so long and slow. The plot is great. The acting is very good, and great in some cases(for the most part, actually). The film contains a multitude of interesting, well-developed characters... but maybe that's part of the problem; there are too many of them. By the end of the film, I found myself being able to keep up with who was who, and as the credits came on, I couldn't really remember any of the names(though that may have something to do with them being in Japanese). The film has plenty of good dialog, though several of the characters spout lines that sound like they come from fortune cookies, but given just a little thought, they are quite profound. The film is called the first actual action film, due to the use of many plot points that have later ended up being clichés. The film has so much going for it, but at the end, I found myself barely paying attention. Maybe the film is too long for its own good... maybe I have a too short attention spam to fully enjoy the film(which is said to be a masterpiece, which I definitely won't argue with)... I don't know. In the end, after carefully going over all of the pros and cons of the film, I find myself rating it a nearly perfect 9/10. Too many low points to it to merit a perfect 10, but far too many high points to rate it any lower, even if I didn't particularly care for the last part of the movie(which probably has more to do with my attention spam than the content of that part of the movie). The cinematography is excellent. The film is very, very well-done overall, but seems a little too long and slow, and is hurt(in any other part of the world) by the very obvious Japanese culture/nature of the film, which is a little hard to accept, especially for us Westerners. It is a great film, though, and I can't argue with its placement on the top 250 best films of all time here on IMDb(it's #5 as I'm writing this). As a final note; to anyone out there who want to see the movie but are worried about violent content: everything is only implied. Much like Hitchcock, Kurosawa obviously realized the effect of only implying violence, and as a result, most people can watch the film. Most people will probably enjoy (at least) parts of it, but I fear few will watch the whole thing through. Since I barely did so myself, I can't really say anything to keep you watching all the way through to the end; but I will say that the film is visually impressive, contains some great acting, some humane and credible characters that the audience will be able to sympathize and identify with. I recommend the film to just about anyone who is interested in watching it. However, if there are action/Samurai fans out there, craving for fight scenes and Katana action, I will say this; Look elsewhere. This has very little of such, and what there is, is only implied. Watch this movie, but watch it for the drama, not the hope of fight scenes. 9/10",Seven Samurai
17,view_and_review,Self-Sacrificing Samurai,8,8 October 2018,When some lowly farmers in 16th century feudal Japan decide to protect their tiny village from bandits they set out to find some samurais that can help them. They set out for four and are convinced that they need at least seven. With nothing to offer but rice and a place to sleep they needed to find samurais that were willing to fight for the sake of fighting or fight for the honorable cause of helping the little guy.This movie was incredibly long but marvelous. At roughly three and a half hours it is long enough for two movies. Even as good as it was I needed three intermissions to finish it. This is not to say that the movie was boring I just needed a break. The performances were good as far as I could tell being an American judging Japanese actors. Who doesn't like a tale of self-sacrifice to help the downtrodden?,Seven Samurai
18,evanston_dad,There's Not One Thing Wrong with This Film,10,14 August 2006,"If you think a three-hour Japanese movie from the mid-50s about an ancient time in history sounds like one big snoozer, you'd be right. It SOUNDS like a snoozer. But just sit down to watch this film, and you'll realize how wrong you are. ""Seven Samurai"" is one of the most exciting, suspenseful films I've ever seen, and the running time passed so quickly that I wasn't even ready for the film to be over. I've watched T.V. sitcoms that felt longer.Akira Kurosawa displays utter mastery of every aspect of cinema. There's not a flaw in this film: it's flawlessly acted, paced, edited, composed, scored. It's an action film for thinking people, one that more than holds its own against any movie released today.Astoundingly good.Grade: A+",Seven Samurai
19,Uriah43,One of the Best Films Ever Made in Japan,8,20 June 2013,"At about the same time as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in France (1572) a civil war has broken out in Japan which has spread chaos throughout that country. Because of the turbulence, brigands roam the land raping and pillaging along the way. Having already lost their summer crop of rice to them, a small village has learned that the same band of brigands are planning to return once their winter barley has ripened. Without this crop of barley to sustain them the people in the village will starve to death. Realizing that they are no match against this group of bandits the people go to the village patriarch and ask him what they should to do. He tells them to hire some samurai to protect the village. Unfortunately, they have very little to offer other than a small amount of food. So the village patriarch tells them to find some ""hungry samurai"". With that advice a few of the farmers venture out of their village hoping to find a few samurai who might be willing to help them out. As luck would have it they manage to find one particularly wise samurai named ""Kambei Shimada"" (Takashi Shimura) who not only agrees to help them but he also recruits 5 more samurai of exceptional talent to join their cause. Additionally, another warrior named ""Kikuchiyo"" (Toshiro Mifune) follows them even though he was initially rejected by Kambei. As a result there are now seven samurai who agree to fight for the village--against 40 brigands. Anyway, rather than spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is perhaps one of the best films ever made in Japan. Be advised though that it is a bit long (141 minutes) and the acting is more than a little overly dramatic in the typical Japanese fashion. But there is plenty of action and humor along with a depth that is seldom seen in motion pictures. Not only was it nominated for 2 Academy Awards but it was also remade 6 years later into a western movie known as ""The Magnificent Seven"". Highly recommended to those who enjoy classic films from around the world.",Seven Samurai
20,morrison-dylan-fan,"""This is the nature of war:By protecting others you save yourself,if you think of yourself, you'll only destroy yourself.""",9,3 June 2021,"Along with Rashomon (1950-also reviewed) this is the title that I was aware of by auteur film maker Akira Kurosawa, but had never got round to viewing. Watching the first 14 movies Kurosawa directed in a row,I got set to finally meet each samurai.View on the film:Spanning across two disc, Criterion present a pristine transfer,with the film being supported by two detailed audio commentaries,and a third DVD packed with interviews.Spreading the 148 shooting days across the entire year,with the studio fearing a disaster as production went four times over the original budget on what would become the title with the longest run time to come from the film maker, editor/ co-writer/(with regular collaborators of this era Shinobu Hashimoto & Hideo Oguni) directing auteur Akira Kurosawa reunites with cinematographer Asakazu Nakai and lays out the battleground canvas in long panning shots across the farmland.Charging to a superb score from regular composer Fumio Hayasaka, (the last completed score for a Kurosawa movie he would do,before dying of tuberculous in 1955 at 41 years old) Kurosawa continues to build on the experimentation with light that had been ignited in Rashomon, via reflecting shards of light across the samurai in the heat of battle,which gets whipped by rain hitting them like a sword through the heart.Binding each of the loner ronin together, Kurosawa expands on his sharp eye for depth of field, with ultra-stylised dolly shots and delicately composed tracking shots unveiling an immerse atmosphere which glides the audience deep into the village, that is burnt down by Kurosawa's excellent, distinctive screen-wipes slicing into the bond of the seven, leading to a poetic, Pyrrhic final shot.Detailed by Kenneth Turan in the Criterion booklet that the title was written in 6 weeks, with Kurosawa banning co-writers Hashimoto and Oguni from taking any phone calls or having visitors come round their homes until the script was completed, the writers have the destruction from war (a major theme in Kurosawa's work) hang in the air,as the dialogue becomes increasingly brittle from each battle that opens new wounds in the samurai's.Wandering the land with no direction home, the writers match up the moral code of each samurai with new personal power from their new responsibilities which becomes an armor, that gets hammered from each battle, where their aggressive behavior poisons their relationship with the locals and grinding down the moral line of separation between the samurai and the bandits, until their decades-held code of loyalty is left as a pile of ashes on the hills.Spinning across the battlefield like a rabid Tasmanian Devil, Toshiro Mifune gives a fantastic performance as samurai Kikuchiyo, who coming from a poor farming family, carries an anguished aware of the decay seeping in, but is unable to turn away,from charging in with the magnificent seven samurai.",Seven Samurai
21,zetes,"Great Film, but I think Kurosawa did better",9,8 April 2000,"Watching this film for over 3 hours, I felt excited every step of the way. I thought the situation was interesting, the characters were interesting, the acting was spectacular, and the action to be very intelligently crafted. But I felt there were some small problems, as well. The characters' names were rarely spoken, so it became easier to mix some of the characters up as the film progressed. Especially, I thought two of the samurai looked very like each other (and the person with whom I was watching this film had the same problem, so it's not just me).Also, I don't think this film belongs within the top ten of anyone's list. It is very well directed and executed, but it has no profundity. After I was done watching it, I put it away, went to my room, and thought very little about it. A great film leads to pondering. I think Kurosawa's _Rashomon_ and, even moreso, _Ran_ contained a lot more depth. Also, Japan has produced many, many very thoughtful and powerful animated films such as _Princess Mononoke_ and _Grave of the Fireflies_. _The Seven Samurai_ is a great film, but I would hesitate to call it a masterpiece.",Seven Samurai
22,StevePulaski,"A sprawling, immense epic that still feels distinctly modern after more than fifty years",10,10 September 2015,"Countless reviews, analyses, essays, thinkpieces, and even full-length novels concerning the sheer genius and magnitude of Akira Kurosawa's masterful Seven Samurai have been published, so a very lengthy analysis from me is unnecessary, given there's probably very little to say that hasn't already been said (the inherent struggle of reviewing beloved classics). However, in the midst of this, the obvious elements of the film ostensibly get lost in the shuffle, due to the focus being placed on analyzing themes and character motivations in the film (a somewhat essential, but sometimes distracting element to film criticism, leaving important focal points like shooting techniques, cinematography, and pacing in the dust). I'm prepared to extract Seven Samurai's more surface attributes, in addition to affirming why this film has etched itself into being one of the greatest films ever made.For a film over three hours in length, the plot is incredibly simple, as it concerns a group of Japanese farmers are experiencing an intrusion of bandits during the Sengoku period in Japan. The tight-knit group of villagers are finding their peaceful and harmless way of life the target of violence and theft of their minimal goods, such as rice, beans, and sake. Powerless, and largely pacifist, the farmers have little way to defend themselves, so they call on seven samurais to defend them in their time of need. Led by Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), though his samurai roots fraudulent, the samurais and farmers unleash a battle for the ages against the ruthless bandits.Kurosawa was given unprecedented creative freedom by the studio Toho, which was about to strike gold with Ishirō Honda's Godzilla months later for the same reason, so Seven Samurai feels uncommonly original and fresh; a product of Kurosawa's rather than passive studio heads. Like artists before him who obtained the rare luxury, Kurosawa took this creativity and ran with it, first and foremost, establishing newfound storytelling elements that would become something of a standard in films to come. Plot elements now viewed as clichés such as the inferior team calling on the superior team for help in time of need, a star-crossed romance in the midst of wartime and violence, and finding sympathy and love for the underdog were all debatably pioneered in Seven Samurai.On a technical level, Seven Samurai is a marvel for a plethora of reasons, as well. It was one of the first films to use telephoto lenses, shooting grandscale battle scenes from multiple different angles, maintaining continuity and giving the film fluidity. Kurosawa would set up three different cameras, each capturing different, often unique, angles of the battle scenes late in the film, in order to plunge the viewer in the center of the action rather than making them feel like they were lost in a cacophony of madness. This choice undoubtedly hails from Kurosawa's view of the traditional American Western, which he claims had a certain ""grammar"" and poetry to their storytelling and their visuals.With that, Kurosawa creates an immaculately detailed picture, filled with characters that take time to unfold and showcase their complexities as humans. There's Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya), a villager with a short fuse and a big plan to give anybody who messes with his villagers hell, Manzō (Kamatari Fujiwara), a man who's prime concern in the midst of all this violence is his beloved daughter Shino (Keiko Tsushima), who meets and falls in love with Katsushirō (Isao Kimura), one of the seven samurais. My personal favorite character was Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari), a feeble and sensitive elder of his village, shocked and dismayed at what it has become in the wake of violence. His facial expressions speak volumes as loud as the wails of bandits far and wide, and his sensitivity provides the film with some of the sadder elements of the film. Kurosawa paints these characters in a way that's humanizing and the liberal runtime allows for us to get to know these characters and their weaknesses rather than looking at them as faceless characters plunged into a long, rowdy setpiece.Ultimately, it's the richness and the overall density of what is uniformly a simple, straight-forward picture that makes Akira Kurosawa's sprawling, expansive epic so memorable. He combines heartbreaking drama, serious suspense, horror, light-hearted comedy, and credible pathos over the course of three and a half-hours and rarely slows down in his desire to create a film that's immersive and groundbreaking. All of this is encapsulated in a film that has a plot that virtually anyone can follow and a character most can relate to or sympathize with. Seven Samurai is powerful cinema in the first degree; a film more than fifty years old that feels distinctly modern, making a statement and leaving us with a lot of content and insights to chew on, before, like a cowboy in a traditional Western, riding off and letting us soak in what we just saw as if we're perched directly under the hot, debilitating sun.Starring: Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura, Keiko Tsushima, Isao Kimura, Bokuzen Hidari Daisuke Katō, Seiji Miyaguchi, Yoshio Inaba, Minoru Chiaki, Kamatari Fujiwara, Kokuten Kōdō, Yoshio Tsuchiya, Yukiko Shimazaki, and Eijirō Tōno.

23,ksf-2,another long kurosawa,7,22 June 2020,"After all his awesome (but LONG) films... Director Kurosawa was finally nominated in 1986, and given an honorary oscar in 1990. i'm surprised that he hadn't won for any of his earlier works, which were large, full, epics. Hidden Fortress. ""Ran"" was nominated for a couple, and won for best costume. Back to Seven Samurai, in 1954. Stars Toshiro Mifune, of course; they would make 25 films together! Kikuchiyo (Mifune) rounds up six other ronin to help defend the town against the coming invasion; the invaders are waiting until the crops are harvested, and will swoop in for the easy payoff. Kikuchiyo isn't really a samurai, but needs the meals that come with the work. famine. rain. misery. Takashi Shimura is Kambei Shimada, who turns out to be the real leader of the defenders. like most Kurosawa films, it's very big, and dramatic. and so many scenes just go on SO long. i guess because he was such a force in japan, no-one had the authority to tell him to make cuts. most of his films are great, also but SO long.

24,lasttimeisaw,Seven Samurai,8,20 August 2012,"There is a nuanced feeling between a new release could score an 8/10 (say THE DARK KINGHT RISE 2012) and a classic acquire the same rank, (but if divided more precisely, which I feel compulsory to do but in lack of a potential spur to re-set my entire rating system. TDKR is around 7.8-8.2 while SEVEN SAMURAI is surely wavering around 8.2-8.5). SEVEN SAMURAI, an esteemed masterpiece from the reasonably most eminent auteur, Akira Kurosawa, not only from Japan, but the wholesale film history as well, why my belated first- viewing has a tad underwhelming collision, notably juxtaposed with another Akira's chef- d'oeuvre RASHOMON (1950, 9/10), which had been my one and only entrance before SEVEN SAMURAI, this action saga of seven samurai trains local village farmers and fights against bandits has a thrilling in-depth character-building deployment and the action sequences are cutting-edge of its time. And seminally a full-flown censure upon class discrimination could reverberate till today although we are miles away from the feudal era. Against a 207 minutes running time, surprisingly I still cannot distinctively tell each samurai from their appearances and 4 of them all died from muskets is a grave ridicule of the deprivation-ridden samurai social stratum, nothing is remotely close to any dueling-style combat which I prefigured during the much-hyped final showdown. But the camera-work from Asaichi Nakai is a first-class roller-coaster ride since the fight kicks off, leaving a woeful curtain call of four disturbing graves standing under the background which potently ends the film in a provoking manner. The cast are excellent by and large, with Shimura gives a composed and sage leadership with his empathetic charisma, Mifune, on the other hand, is more rely on his own panache to contradict his identity dilemma (from a farmer-born orphan to an unclassified samurai-wannabe). Several supporting roles are also glistening, Bokuzen Hidari's chicken and wordless farmer who finally delivered his only line during his last breath is striking deep in my mind. Miyaguchi's superbly practiced swordsman also exemplifies the most orthodox samurai image, they are all among the marrow of my first viewing. The sway of the Harakiri spirit is ubiquitous, particularly among the ill-fated bandits, which occasions some random thoughts such as instead of executing themselves on the ultimate suicidal march, they could have retreated and recruited more people and then plotted their revenge which makes for a more common sense instead of being dragged from the horsed and slaughtered one by one by the samurai-farmer coalition. The storyline-setting seems to choose an easier way out and avoids undermining the film's integrity and leaving an edgy unfinished business, nevertheless is this some overt contrivance which plain suffices to facilitate the film which should be at least pointed out? Or maybe I should watch more Japanese films to digest their ethos and frame of minds?",Seven Samurai
25,ElMaruecan82,"Seven Reasons to venerate ""Seven Samurai""...",10,24 July 2015,"1/ BIRTH OF MODERN CINEMA : Seven Samurai, of unequal skills and experience, are hired for a dangerous mission : saving a village from bandits who plan to attack after the harvest. That very premise fathered almost every action movie for the next fifty years, from its remake ""The Magnificent Seven"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" to ""Inglourious Basterds"" or ""The Expendables"". Quoting Ebert, the film also introduces the first Samurai Kambei (Takashi Shimura) while he rescues a young boy by disguising as a monk, which foresees the narrative device of introducing the hero through an unrelated mission. Another interesting trivia is that the original script counted on six Samurai, with Toshiro Mifune playing Seiji Myagushi's role as Kyuzo, the taciturn master swordsman. But then Kurosawa had a strike of genius.2/ EVERY GROUP NEEDS A SCENE-STEALER :Among the six, you have the zealous rookie Katsushiro (Isao Kimura) the amiable although less-skilled Heihachi, played by another recognizable face : Minoru Chiaki (the tallest one), the wise and experienced leader, the stone-faced stoic bad-ass, and other competent lieutenants. That gallery, that was to be reproduced in several films, was incomplete. As interesting and relatable as they were, Kurosawa understood that they would be boring without the obligatory scene-stealer, and how do you steal the thunder of serious and no-nonsense ronin? Simply by playing it in the most exuberant, flamboyant, noisy, showoff, in fact, the Toshiro Mifune way. As Kikuchiyo, Mifune is the spice, the soul of the film, much more with an attitude that never feels gratuitous.3/ CHARACTERIZE THEM THROUGH ACTION : Indeed, not only each of the Samurai is given recognizable traits, but the personalities are revealed through action, never wasted on pointless dialogue. Mifune is obviously desperate to show his skills as a samurai, wearing the most visible armors, the longest spears, overcompensating obviously. It's only later that Kanbei understands he's a farmer's son himself. And he's not the only character to have a secret, the hot-headed farmer Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya) holds a terrible one and the young Katsushiro lives a romance with a villager's daughter played by the inevitable Keiko Tsushima. The village becomes the arena of another battle between classes and egos. Ronin, perceived as lustful, dangerous or greedy individuals are feared by villagers even though they're supposed to help them. But as bandits attack the weak, and samurai protect them, villagers have no other chance than trusting the Samurai and getting along with them.4/ THREE-ACT STRUCTURE : A school-case on that matter : hiring the team, preparing the battle and fighting. The sequences of equal length are handled with methodic and realistic patience. We know the samurai's value for they accept to fight in exchange of hospitality, millet and also some consideration, but it takes more to build sympathy. As it takes time for villagers to learn how to fight, the occasion of a few comedic scenes involving Kikuchyo and the poor cowardly Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari). And there's the battle, an even more heart-pounding sequence because it doesn't happen in once. It's made of preemptive strikes where they discover that the enemies have three muskets, which are like bullets from one-gun movies (Kurosawa's noir- masterpiece ""Stray Dog"" to name one) each one plays a role, each death is memorable, that's the emotional reward of 'slowness', just as Kambei who takes his time counting the number of bandits killed.5/ KNOW HOW TO USE TIME AND SPACE : ""Seven Samurai"" is shot in exterior, not in studio because Kurosawa wanted to give the film the most authentic feel, regardless of the costs or delays in productions, he followed his instinct of a filmmaker. Therefore, the setting plays a pivotal role, Kambei inspects the zone and orders the construction of ditches around the village, later; groups of villagers would welcome any intruding bandit with spears.. The stratagem works as it allows them to capture bandits or kill them one by one. But bandits learns to overcome them and enter the village during a climactic downpour during which water and mud slow down every movement and make the battle more chaotic and the thrills more breathtaking, and the ultimate confrontation more emotionally satisfying.6/ MASTER DIRECTOR, EDITOR AND STORYTELLER :Kurosawa directed these battle scenes with a remarkable craftsmanship, swinging between large panoramic shots with standard classics like the enemy peering from over a cliff and horsemen riding it down, to more close-ups of swords clinching each other. Watching the film, I was left with the impression that Kurosawa didn't take chances but on the contrary, the most different and awkward angles he could, and thanks to a painstaking dedication to editing, he got this magnificent result. Kurosawa was a great director because he mastered two things : editing and storytelling.7/ LEGACY : So, if there ever was a center of Cinema's universe, no one could be as influential for modern film-making as the Japanese Master. ""Rashomon"" was the first movie to use the unreliable narrator device and alternate views of the same reality, and ""Hidden Fortress"" and ""Yojinbo"" would later influence two of the most popular movie series : ""Star Wars"" and Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. But for all they're worth, these legacies are nothing compared to the milestone directed in 1954, that title preceded by its reputation, perhaps the most famous Japanese movie : ""Seven Samurai"". And there are reasons why ""Seven Samurai"" is so grandly regarded, at least, seven.",Seven Samurai
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Magnificent.,8,5 August 2019,"Akira Kurosawa's samurai classic isn't so much slow as it is meticulous, taking all the time it needs to establish - and then elaborate upon - its core conceit, characters and style. 'Seven Samurai (1954)' may be three-and-a-half hours long (and literally the longest film I've seen to date), but it moves at a lick. Of course, it's not edge-of-your-seat exciting right the way through, but it's not supposed to be. It moves towards a well-documented 'finale' that, essentially, takes up around half of its run-time. The actual gathering of the eponymous seven is a relatively breezy affair; much more time is spent on the planning and execution of the war-like village-defence that most pictures would relegate to their final set-pieces. Here, however, the prolonged battle is just that: prolonged. It's violent, messy and drawn-out, lacking any real semblance of heroism or clear cut 'good guys'. Obviously, we want our focal characters to succeed. Nobody is perfect, however. The seemingly innocent farmers have dark secrets they go to great lengths to conceal and the samurai themselves use a number of seemingly underhanded, if necessary, techniques in their quest for victory. Even the largely villainous bandits are presented as just order-following counterpoints to the samurai, echoes of the soldiers our heroes once were. They're, ostensibly, separated from the seven only by their position in the attack-defence equation. Such is the very nature of the feature, its narrative shaded in as much grey as the celluloid itself. In that, it finds a very unique, somewhat downbeat perspective. When all is said and done, was it worth it? It's a question that the piece doesn't so much seek to answer as dare to pose, rounding off a nuanced experience that isn't afraid to leave its audience unfulfilled. It spends as much time on its smaller, more personal moments as it does on its larger, more technically-impressive ones. The latter may be what everyone, collectively, remembers but the former are what make this a landmark in the genre. Each core player has something significant to do, even if they don't necessarily undergo an overall arc. Some of the main seven do begin to bleed into one another, but even the most generic of the lot have something that allows them to stand out. Plus, the focus is placed on a few key components and these are explored incredibly well. By crafting characters that seem so complete you could almost swear they were real, the movie creates a tremendous connection with the audience. You care about pretty much everyone on-screen, which leads to a great deal of tension when their lives are on the line. The unceremonious nature of every single death lends itself to an almost greater sense of loss, too; anyone could die at any moment. The affair isn't overly dark, though. It has an excellent handle on its tone, providing moments of real levity to balance out its sombre segments. When the action comes, it's as entertaining as you'd expect. It's actually tinged with a certain sadness - which makes it all the more distinct and, even, compelling - but the fantastic choreography is a sight to behold. This all results in an adventure unlike almost any other. It's a masterclass of film-making that should keep you engaged for its entire, mammoth-sized duration. 8/10",Seven Samurai
27,gbill-74877,Masterpiece,10,10 March 2018,"It's hard to heap more superlatives on this film given all those that it's received from countless critics and viewers over the years. It's certainly worthy of them. The story is perfect. The characters and acting are memorable. Director Akira Kurosawa has a fantastic sense of pace, and even at three and a half hours, every scene seems important. We're transported to 16th century Japan, a time when bandits terrorize the countryside and a village of farmers, but the film's themes are timeless. As epic as the movie is, with a samurai team of six assembled one by one by its leader (Takashi Shimura), it would not have been the same without the seventh, a samurai-wannabe played by Toshiro Mifune. He's brash, exuberant, funny, brave, foolish, and heartfelt. He's in many brilliant scenes, but my favorite is when he describes what tricks the farmers may be up to, and we gradually understand that he himself was a farmer's son, with a tragic past. His performance is right up there with Brando in terms of intensity and honesty.Kurosawa is smart in so many ways here, one of which is to orient the viewer to the village and its surroundings by showing the leader of the group plan its defense. In addition to Mifune's character, he also lightens the mood with the forbidden love between the young samurai apprentice (Isao Kimura) and a young woman masquerading as a boy (Keiko Tsushima). Their scene in the woodland flowers is gorgeous. I love how the samurai are as tough as nails, but know they don't need to show it, and instead exude a sense of calm, playfulness, and understanding. With the exception of an extremely skillful and solemn swordsman (Seiji Miyaguchi), they smile in many scenes, and all of them accept the difficulty and danger of their fate. Despite their skill, they do not seek out violence. They are calm in moments of peace, intelligent in planning for battle, and brave and unflinching under attack. While the film and these character types have been emulated many times over the years, the difference between these samurai and western action heroes is still stark, and refreshing. In this little village and the situation it faces, we see a microcosm of the world. We see all of the very natural reactions to pressure, and despite the mythic quality of a small outnumbered band of heroic samurai, the film has an authenticity to it. We see all of the very natural reactions to pressure.

Apart from the fact that it is technically perfect, this is one of the most influential films of all time. From today's perspective, the film tells the story that has been seen many times, but this is because the Kurosawa's version has left such a strong impression that, in the following decades, many filmmakers were inspired by it. The most famous remake is the western ""The Magnificent seven"" (1960), which tells the same story, and even copies some scenes, only places them in Wild West and replaces the samurai with the gunslingers. Each frame of this film is a perfect black and white photography, the story is well developed, the characterization is convincing, and the performance is excellent (even to those like me who hate over-acting and exaggerated drama typical for Japanese). I could point to a couple of weaker points in the story and acting, but that would be only a subjective impression that arose from the personal taste and cultural gap between the East and the West.

Seeing Takashi Shimura in the credits also confirmed my logic that this was going to at least be an entertaining three and a half hours.I was mistaken, Seven Samurai is not good............it's outstanding.Wonderfully crafted, perfectly scored, incredibly choreographed, well acted and beautifully written this is well deserving of it's high place and I would consider it nothing short of a masterpiece.If you check out my IMDB rating distribution it's very clear to see that getting anything higher than an eight is a rarity, this deserves it on so many levels.I didn't expect this level of quality further as generally I don't tend to agree with titles in the IMDB top 250, this however I do I thoroughly unconditionally agree.A masterpiece and essential viewing, I don't even need to give the premise of the movie in this review and must simply stress that this is film making mastery at its finest.The Good:Takashi ShimuraVery well shot for its timePerfectly craftedThe Bad:Nothing springs to mindThings I Learnt From This Movie:Akira Kurosawas should be a household name, not Bruckheimer or Bay!I'll put money down now that none of the remakes or movies heavily influenced by Seven Samurai comes close in quality",Seven Samurai
32,kenjha,The Emperor is Naked,4,20 October 2008,"This is universally regarded as one of the greatest films in cinematic history, but the emperor is wearing no clothes! The film has the visual elegance one would expect from a great director, but a great director also elicits good performances from his cast. This is where Kurosawa fails. While Shimura is fine as the leading samurai, much of the acting in this film is overly theatrical and melodramatic. Mifune is supposed to be endearing and funny, but his over-the-top acting makes his character most annoying. The narrative is not compelling enough to sustain a length of three and half hours. The final battle scenes are so drawn out that they lose their sense of excitement.",Seven Samurai

Its impact can be felt in every era and continuing today. Although it is quite long, not a single shot or minute is wasted as every part of the film has significance. The world and acting are very lifelike, which immerses the viewer in a believable and nuanced era with desperate farmers and warriors, all with their own backgrounds and personalities. This is the strength of the film as the characters are never just obligatory archetypes. Each of the samurai is so distinct - a wise elder, an impassioned young man, a reckless glory seeker and more. This creates so many great scenarios as they try to defend the farmers, all with their own motivations and methods. There's no Hollywood heroics here - every conflict, whether physical or social, has to be resolved within the restrictions of their situation. From arming the peasants to abandoning the houses south of the river to family conflicts, the plight of the poor village is filled with constant tension and drama.",Seven Samurai

The agreement was that the seven samurai will protect the villagers and their crops, and the villagers from the other hand will supply the samurai with three small meals a day.Akira Kurosawa made this film to show us what man is capable of doing when is threatened by someone else.

36,eddie_baggins,A defining piece of cinema history,9,15 July 2020,"Changing the landscape of cinema forever, Seven Samurai is a monumental film for the industry, with Akira Kurosawa's meticulously crafted action epic setting the tone not only for how films were shot moving forward but also setting up the now well-worn trope of groups banding together for a common cause, that allowed beloved favorites such as The Dirty Dozen, Western riff The Magnificent Seven and even The Avengers to be born into existence.Shot over a grueling 148 day period and finalized far over its initial budget, Samurai was a mammoth undertaking not only by the standards of the day in which is was made but by modern day standards also, as Kurosawa would leave no stone unturned in creating his dream project that harked back to his own families heritage to the samurai warriors and his nations rich history of conflicts and over comings.Set mostly in a stunningly made set that recreated the rural setting of Japanese farming life in the 1500's, Samurai embeds us into the lives of a group of farming families who are fearful of their lives at the hands of marauding bandits that threaten their otherwise peaceful existence, so much so that they come to the conclusion they must seek the help of skillful samurai to protect and defend their village and put a stop to the reign of terror that has engulfed their daily routines.Paced without an ounce of rush or hurry (the film clocks in at an intermission held 3 hours and 27 minutes), Kurosawa takes his time establishing each and every one of the eventual seven able bodied men that band together as one to help train and protect the village people, with the film giving that rare chance for all of its core characters to have their moment in the spotlight as we learn to understand their various motivations and traits as the film builds towards its more action packed final hour that features some of the era's most memorable set-pieces and directional choices.Heralded as a favorite of many directors that we know and love today (Star Wars master George Lucas credits the film as his favorite of all time), Samurai's handling of its ensemble, lead by scene stealing Kurosawa partner in crime Toshirô Mifune as the loud-mouthed Kikuchiyo and Takashi Shimura as the Yoda like master of the group Kambei Shimada, the way in which events transpire throughout Samurai's simple but also layered plot are ground-breaking for the time and while lesser in impact and nature today thanks to so many years of film following in its wake, still make for mostly gripping viewing throughout.There are elements of the film that haven't aged as well as other components, some of the supporting performances are prone to overacting that was prevalent in the time period and there is a sense at times that a tighter cut of certain scenes could've helped the flow of the film but with its stunning cinematography courtesy of Asakazu Nakai (so many shots of this film could be transported straight to a painting/image on your wall), beautifully crafted surrounds designed by production designer Takashi Matsuyama and art director Sô Matsuyama, Kurosawa's ageless piece of art is deserving of its reputation as a grandfather of the cinema we now devour and love today.Final Say -It may not be the perfect film but Seven Samurai is the work of a once in a life time master who pushed the boundaries so that others who followed in his wake had a rule-book on how cinema could be done and worlds crafted to ones endless imagination and inspiration.4 1/2 rice balls out of 5",Seven Samurai

Superior in every aspect to the Hollywood samurai movies - acting, directing etc. Everything in this movie is top notch, sometimes to watch is like to meditate.

Rashômon. Tsubaki Sanjûrô.

39,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Legendary Human Battle Drama ! Japanese Cinema outscored Hollywood.,8,23 July 2020,"Seven Samurai (1954) :
Brief Review -A Legendary Human Battle Drama ! Japanese Cinema outscored Hollywood. Seven Samurai is considered among the Greatest Battle Movies ever made in Action Adventure genre and i have been waiting since long time to catch it and judge it if all been said is true or not. The answer is Yes. This is truly a Legendary Human Battle Drama and yet it was perfectly character driven story followed by cultural stereotypes. May be that's what something different about this film that other films tried to keep adventure elements intact while Seven Samurai clearly outgrossed by adding human values. Hollywood hadn't seen any such Large Scale battle film by 1954 (correct me if i am wrong), if i have to remember something close to that time the it was 'Bridge On The River Kwai', a Classic but it wasn't still of that level. So, i can say Japanese Cinema outscored Hollywood by comfortable margin. Seven Samurai is about a Village which is attacked by the Bandits so they hire Seven Samurais to protect them and rest of the plot follows the procedure. Writing of the film is notable for sure because of addition of human emotions, moral values and cultural hatred. With the runtime of 207 minutes the screenplay is little slow at the beginning but then picks up well after the intermission. Acting wise all the seven samurai were naturally beautiful and the villagers were well supporting. Cinematography scores merits in the battle scenes especially in the climax which has been shot in rain and slime. Akira Kurosawa does his best while handling this action adventure ride and yet manages to pull off some philosophical stuff from human resources just like he did with 'Roshomon"". The storytelling is detailed and analysis of characters is deep even of the characters aren't shown as greats. Overall, Seven Samurai is definitely a Classic film and looking at it's release date it seems better than that status.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Seven Samurai
40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Superbly crafted, classic cinema, just not the emotional tug",8,8 June 2008,"""Seven Samurai"" should truly be regarded as a classic. Compared to what little I have seen that came out of the 1950s, the storytelling here is truly epic. However, unlike many classics, this film didn't hit me like I expected from one of the consistently most highly rated films of all time. While there is great camera-work, great characters and engaging action, the film lacks the intimacy that a three and a half hour film ought to have. To its credit, the film is not too slow except for the beginning at times, but to say this film has a wide and trans- generational appeal is a stretch.The premise alone is classic and clearly oft-repeated. A village of poor Japanese farmers go out to hire samurai to defend their village from bandits. The first portion of the film is finding the samurai and introducing the main characters, planning and training the villagers. Why exactly the samurai agree to help these farmers is the film's deepest question. It would have been nice if that question really hit harder than it did.Among the memorables in the cast are Takashi Shimura as Kambei, the first of the samurai and Toshiro Mifune as Kukichiyo, the wild and outspoken one who is technically not a samurai at all. Director and writer Akira Kurosawa has these characters well-developed in terms of their personality and demeanor, but not as much in the sense of the audience identifying strongly with them (except, and notably so, Kukichiyo). Kukichiyo is a stellar character. You find yourself at odds with him at times and beside him at others--he's very admirable. These two mentioned characters, however, are the strongest in the way they are part of the theme.Kurosawa certainly should not be shorted in credit as a great director. Every scene is very precisely planned and executed and tastefully so. The action sequences are also entertaining. While I hate to make a comment like this, the lack of blood (due likely to budget issues) hurt the film for me. It doesn't have the same effect on me to see someone get stabbed or shot and not really see that. Graphic violence in this film would have really helped me to feel the impact of the situation and the true nature of the life-or-death scenario the villagers were put in. Their unruly behavior was helpful to that end, but it just didn't strike a chord. Still, the film raises some great questions, namely the aforementioned simply put question of ""why?"" Each samurai seems to have his own reason for wanting to defend a village that has nothing to offer him. The issues of class and moral conflict of selfishness vs. selflessness really do show in the film, just not pervasively. Everything was there in this film, just not the lasting emotional impacting, that resonating feeling a film like this ought to have. Perhaps that was due to length, though I think that only played a minimal role. I can't disagree with the majority that absolutely loves this film, but personally I didn't feel it. Maybe you will.",Seven Samurai
41,Anonymous_Maxine,"Better than The Gammage Cup, Wolves of the Calla, and A Bug's Life combined!!",10,1 February 2006,"Akira Kurosawa's ambitious Seven Samurai is a film that has been emulated and duplicated and imitated in almost every medium you can think of, probably most in books and movies, as in the cases above. It is a classic story of protection and thinly disguised revenge that has tremendous satisfactory power, but Kurosawa knows enough to avoid over-simplifying the impact of his film by introducing fault into the characters being protected.It is never really proved whether or not Kikuchio's (Toshiro Mifune, a Kurosawa veteran) assertion that the farmers were not nearly as poor (and therefore unable to pay them) as they let on is actually true, but it introduces doubt as to whether they are perfect victims. This is, of course, a movie about people, not about two dimensional characters, and any forward thinking village is going to try to save up whatever wealth or food that they can compile in order to ensure their own survival. I won't pretend to understand completely what compels samurai to do what they do, to risk their lives for such little (if any) reward, but I know that it is something that is almost universally accepted by samurais, and if I'm not mistaken, the samurai that abandon that code are known as Ronin, a not very enviable title. The movie is definitely something of a commitment at three and a half hours, but it flows smoothly and it takes the time to get to know its characters, which allows it to present the real world so much more clearly, and I was surprised to find that one of the most powerful scenes in the entire film took place in the last minute or two of the movie. This is an intense anti-war film that allows you to identify with three different sides in battle, the victims, the protectors, and the oppressors (although that third not quite as much), and I think that one of the most important things that it does is that it provides a look into an ancient Japanese culture and makes an assertion about what may have happened that allowed for more flexibility in their culture rather than a strict adherence to established traditions, much like Chinua Achebe does in his novel Things Fall Apart, but I digress.One of the things that is introduced very early in the film is the fact that samurai are not entirely trusted by the villagers, and it is strictly forbidden that they mix with their culture, they are treated almost as subhumans, but their battlefield prowess is intensely desired. When a conflict arises about a local man's daughter becoming involved with a young samurai who is there to protect the village, he demands action and retribution, but the well-being of the rest of the village is deemed more important. There is a lot going on in the movie in terms of societal roles in Japanese culture, which affects the way things pan out in the movie (although Kurosawa was known for rebelling against such expectations, particularly later in his career), and like so many of Kurosawa's films, there is so much going at so many levels that multiple viewings of the film will reveal more and more things going on that went unnoticed on the first time. Argued by many to be Kurosawa's greatest film, The Seven Samurai is certainly one among many.",Seven Samurai
42,jamesrupert2014,Outstanding and influential samurai sword-opera,9,16 April 2020,"Desperate farmers hire a team of seven swordsmen to defend their poor village from marauding bandits. Akira Kurosawa's first, and arguably best, action-jidaigeki is the archetypal 'team of heroes' film and has been revisited in the old west, in ancient Rome, in outer-space, and elsewhere in unofficial remakes of variable qualities. The cast is great, especially Takashi Shimura as the experienced but down-on-his-luck team leader Kambei Shimada, and although some people may get a bit tired of his antics, Japanese super-star Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) adds some levity to the lengthy drama. Apparently given the OK to portray the character however he wanted, Mifune plays the samurai-wannabe is an endlessly posturing, scratching, joking, lovable-goof, a counterpoint the other six generally stern heroes (especially the po-faced master-swordsman Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi)). Legend has it that Yul Brynner, the head gunfighter in John Sturges' famous Western remake 'The Magnificent Seven' (1961) complained about co-star Steve McQueen, who he accused of 'scene-stealing' by constantly moving around in such a way as the catch the audiences' eye. If true, McQueen certainly could have taken some tips in attracting attention from Mifune's kinetic faux-Ronin. Another story about the Western version was that when asked for permission to shoot parts of the film south of the border, Mexican authorities agreed on the condition that the 'peon' villagers looked 'clean' - perhaps one of the decision-makers had seen Kurosawa's original: most of the Japanese peasants are filthy and some are down-right decrepit looking. There is not much to add to the abundance of material written about this film, its genre, director, and stars - suffice to say that it is entertaining, very well made, and the 200+ minutes pass by surprisingly quickly.",Seven Samurai
43,freemantle_uk,Brilliant Japanese Film,10,27 July 2008,"Seven Samurai is seen as classic film which is highly rated: I am not going to disagree with that analysis. It is a milestone film in Japanese Cinema history and considered by some to be Akira Kurosawa's best film. It is influential, being remade as a western, The Magnificent Seven, and it cinematic tricks being used in other films, e.g. the Star Wars films.The story of the film is Early Modern Japan is in a state of civil war. Bandits roam the countryside and raid villages for food. One village decides to fight back, and hire seven ronins (masterless samurais) to help defend their village.The film is told in three major acts: recruit, training and the battle itself. Each part lasts just over an hour. It is a combination of a serious drama, history and moments of light-hearted comedy. Seven Samuari looks a number of themes, including sexual politics, fear, the village politics, issues of appeasement and war, star-crossed lover, poverty, rural life and Japanese history.Seven Samurai is very well written, looks into the issues of being noble or being plain merecanies. Kurosawa's is great shows why he was one of the best in the business. It had good acting and you do care for the characters. I also didn't mind the moments of comedy. The fights scenes were also particularly brilliant and very well done.I personally feel that Japanese cinema give us some of the best films around and I do like Japanese culture. Seven Samuari is a must see for anyone who enjoys films, regardless.",Seven Samurai
44,ebiros2,Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece,9,1 July 2008,"This movie is made on a different vein even for Akira Kurosawa. Kurosawa made movie to explore his inner artistry, and each movie was a different exploration of his approach to movie making. Shichinin No Samurai was different even for Kurosawa as he explored the limits of realism in movie at the time, and has not been surpassed since then by any Japanese movies. In this movie Kurosawa limited other experimentation to maximize realism, and also didn't include the twist in plot he preferred like in Rashomon or dive too deeply into personal issues like in Norainu. This is probably the reason why movie stands so well after half a century, and have such universal appeal. For instance, Kanbei's character is very believable even today as opposed to character of Chris in the Magnificent Seven which was based on this movie. It was different even for Kurosawa, and maybe the only actor who didn't understand it was Toshiro Mifune who've starred in Kurosawa's movies many times. He acts just as he does in other of Kurosawa's movies which he's played and distracts slightly from the realism. The tone of the movie is very realistic and focus on survival, as opposed to having a real war lord or a samurai. The samurai characters in this movie are actually ""ronin"" who are out of jobs and are wandering the landscape to find a lord who would hire them. So there are really no hero character in this movie (something of Kurosawa's preference). The tone is somewhat noir but the difference is, every lines are sharp and beautiful in this movie. Plot shows the agenda of each parties and person, and revolves around that. The focus is on people, and the issues and needs are immediate. There were other Japanese movies of the time where the focus were on people (such as Ozu Jinpachi's Tokyo Monogatari), but none had the immediate need of people in the central focus as in this one.These are the things that separates Shichnin No Samurai from the rest of the pack. The movie was very experimental for its time, and it succeeded. Nobody else was able to follow Kurosawa's craft as history shows, no other samurai movie achieved the kind of realism this movie did. Kurosawa himself went on to explore other areas of his artistry and never returned to this format. Which makes this one of a kind movie and a master piece from one of the great director of 20th century.",Seven Samurai
45,dee.reid,"Before ""The Magnificent Seven""...",10,9 September 2006,"...There was ""Seven Samurai"" (1954), famed director Akira Kurosawa's towering martial arts action epic of mythical proportions. Action-packed with a wry sense of humor, the plot concerns seven ronin (master-less samurai) who are assembled by the distraught, desperate villagers of a small farm community to fend off the bandits that have been terrorizing them. ""Seven Samurai"" is the second film of Kurosawa's I've seen within the last year, the first being ""Yojimbo"" (1961), which also featured a strong, centralized performance from acclaimed actor Toshiro Mifune. ""Seven Samurai"" is seen as the movie that helped shape Western action films, even though Kurosawa himself was said to be heavily influenced by American westerns. ""Seven Samurai"" was eventually remade into ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960), itself a popular movie in the United States but lacked the flair of its inspired source material. The actors, including lead Takashi Shimura as Kambei, are flawless, as well as the many supporting players who were the farmers. My personal favorite is Mifune's Kikuchiyo, who absolutely steals the show as a humorous, loathsome troublemaker with a dirty mouth, but earns his heroism in an honest, self-sacrificing fashion. The bandits themselves remain mostly faceless, ghostly figures on horseback, though it's easy to compare them somewhat to the portrayal of Native-Americans in American westerns. Although it's over three hours long, the centerpiece of ""Seven Samurai"" is its climatic siege, which eats up nearly the remaining hour. It's agonizing, grueling combat where many die and you are left questioning the title. But, instead of giving us one long, drawn-out sequence, Kurosawa made the genius choice and has the battle broken up into several skirmishes, with moments of contemplation and anguish between. ""Seven Samurai"" is a beautifully realized epic of mythic stature, one of the great pieces from one of the greatest directors to ever pick up a camera.10/10",Seven Samurai

As strategies are hatched and strongholds fortified, we get to know both villagers and warriors on a close, personal level, uncovering their stories as the seasons change and invasion grows imminent.Legend has it that Kurosawa went far above and beyond in fleshing out this cast, composing detailed family trees and personality profiles for each of the hundred-plus roles to help his actors (even the extras) get under their characters' skin. That level of crazy hyper-focus is indicative of the whole production, which vastly overstepped its budget and shot for nearly four times longer than originally scheduled, but the results can't be denied.Seven Samurai is a justifiably revered classic, a prototype for the modern action movie (not to mention a roadmap for the entire western genre), and a rich portrait of a very specific time and cultural relationship in Japanese history.

47,smatysia,Samurai behaving badly,8,10 August 2015,"This is a pretty good movie, but not the best ever, as so many seem to think. What struck me, were the many deviations from samurai culture, something Japanese audiences would be extremely cognizant of, since this culture was only finally crushed in the war ending just nine years before this film. One was at the beginning, when Kambei 1)shaved his topknot to pass as a priest, and 2) did so to save a non-samurai child from a kidnapper. A samurai would have little, if any, concern for such a child. Also Kikuchiyu passing himself as samurai when not born into it. Samurai was a hereditary caste and it would be unthinkable for any Japanese to claim a status he was not entitled to. Also, even the main plot about defending the farming village from bandits. I realize these men were ronin, meaning samurai not in service to a particular liege lord, but even so all of these things would have been dishonorable, and samurai would rather die than behave as such. Kurosawa had to be acutely aware of these things, so it was obviously deliberate. It likely had to do with Japanese politics and mores of the time, which escapes me as a Westerner.",Seven Samurai

But it's well worth the time investment, for this is arguably the finest action film in cinema.The camera-work, fight choreography, and music are all fantastic, but what sets SS apart from other action films is the amount of emphasis it puts on story and character. A great deal too many action films are content to be nothing more than a string of witty banter, chases, and battles, but SS features a wide and memorable cast of characters who, while archetypal (the wise old master, the young pupil, the wild rebel, etc.), are nonetheless relate-able and memorable.Comparing this to its occidental remake, The Magnificent Seven, SS still wins out.

49,dwpollar,Effective drama about a group of professional fighters...,7,28 June 2014,"1st watched 6/21/2014 -- 7 out of 10 (Dir-Akira Kurosawa): Effective drama about a group of professional fighters(aka. Samurai) who are hired to fight and defend a small village from a group of bandits that have been terrorizing them for awhile. The Samurai(originally seven) teach the villagers more than they expect as well as providing them with a more promising . What makes this work is the storytelling and the relationships that occur between the villagers and the Samurai. The Samurai provide very elaborate defenses for the village and a scheme that works to allow them to handle the bandits. They also train the male villagers to be a part of the battle and get them to realize their potentials. The movie is slow in it's development and not really a hard core action movie like it is advertised but more of a story about how this community is established and how they interact. Yes -- there are battles(mostly in the last half of the movie) but the results are pretty inevitable because of the preparation. The villagers start out as meek, shallow people who allow others to stamp all over them -- but they are transformed by the Samurai before the end of the movie to a stronger group more equipped to handle life in general. There is a small romance thrown in involving one of the younger Samurai with a female villager but this is there primarily to show that the villager's original fear about the Samurai overwhelming their woman is not true. The Samurai are not paid for this endeavor -- they are basically given very meager room and board(which shows the character of those who were chosen). A young Toshiro Mifune was the only actor's name I recognized but I'm sure the whole cast is very well known in Japan due to the major hit this was when it came out. This classic film is definitely worth the viewing even at 3 and 1/2 hours.",Seven Samurai
50,kluseba,Timeless classic,9,17 September 2018,"I hesitated checking out the Japanese epic samurai drama Seven Samurai because I made the mistake to watch Kurosawa Akira's Ran a few years ago which turned out to be stiff, predictable and overlong and didn't live up to its excellent reputation. I'm relieved to realize that Seven Samurai indeed deserves the praise it gets. Ironically, it's not the best movie of the year, not even the best Japanese film of that year which was Honda Ishiro's groundbreaking Godzilla which shows how great movies were back in those days. Still, Seven Samurai is a timeless classic whose plot, duels and characters have been copied in numerous films such as The Magnificent Seven.The first thing I liked about the movie is its atmosphere. It has a quite gloomy touch as the fearful peasants and seven brave samurai have to be constantly prepared for the raids of an elevated number of ruthless bandits. As opposed to Hollywood movies, one never knows who is going to survive the next attack which builds up quite a lot of despair and tension until the very end. This atmosphere is perfectly supported by the sinister black and white cinematography and the simplistic yet fitting soundtrack.The settings are also carefully chosen. The village has a raw and simple charm but can turn from a little piece of paradise into a muddy hell rather quickly. It's definitely a very difficult battlefield. The romantic scenes in the fields of flowers in the middle section are contrasted by the torrential rain during the epic final battle that ends the movie on a high note.The characters are fascinating and fleshed out. Each of the seven samurai has different character traits. The most impressive ones are the aged leader Kambei with his strong moral compass, the hopeless young romantic Katsushiro and the savage outsider Kikuchiyo. Even the villagers are quite unique. The elder miller and village patriarch Gisaku who refuses to evacuate, the hotheaded Rikichi who hides a sad secret and the emotional farmer's daughter Shino are only some of these fascinating characters.The acting performances make the characters even better. Shimura Takashi's performance as intellectual leader is absolutely believable and one can understand why the other characters follow his commands despite risking their lives. Mifune Toshiro is brilliant as tough guy with a soft core who constantly tries to improve his reputation which leads to some brutal, desperate but also humorous scenes not unlike Eli Wallach's performance as Tuco in the iconic The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. On the other side, Miyaguchi Seiji contrasts the young and emotional characters with his performance as calm, disciplined and serious swordsman. The actors and actresses aren't only convincing on their own but complement one another perfectly. Their diversity is a strength in this film.The directing has to be pointed out as well. Despite its colossal length, the movie never felt boring because it found the right balance between the main plot and numerous efficient side stories that add depth to the different characters. The camera work is calm and precise and on a much higher level than contemporary action movies with shaky cameras. On the other side, the use of wipes to change between scenes gives the movie a more fluid pace at times. The mixture of calm cinematographic techniques and a few more dynamic elements is perfectly balanced.In the end, I have only positive things to say about this movie. If you like action films, this groundbreaking film is an iconic milestone. If you prefer dramas, you will find plenty of it in the complex relationships between the different characters.

52,drystyx,Hard to find words great enough to describe movie,10,10 July 2006,"I'll start by saying I'm one of those cads who can't stand subtitles, and I'm bored by them, so how did this movie completely mesmerize me and hold me spellbound beginning to end? In short, everything about the movie was outstanding. Action-adventure-you got it. Plots and subplots-Ibsen and Williams would be envious. You already know the acting, directing, editing, etc, is superb. But what really drives me bananas about this movie and makes me never tire of watching it, is the characters. Not only do the seven samurai become beloved to us, but the farmers as well, and even some of the bandits. Each character lives and breathes beside us, to the ill fated weak samurai to the bandit who mistakenly calls Toshiru Mifune his brother. But the four chief farmers share center stage with the seven samurai, along with a few female characters, Grandad, and the bandit chieftan. One of the farmers, Ricici, is so brave that he could be called the eighth samurai. And each of the four makes a notable sacrifice to hold onto their crops. One loses his daughter's honor, one loses his home, one loses his wife, and one loses his life. The subtle friendships, such as between Ricici and the apprentice samurai, are expertly hinted at without being expository. Believe me, even if you hate subtitles, I feel confident that you will love this movie.",Seven Samurai
53,Steffi_P,"""I'd hate to die on that dunghill""",10,25 March 2007,"This is Kurosawa's best known and most beloved film, and rightly so. Seven Samurai has been called the first modern action movie. That's a matter perhaps more of definitions than anything else, but whatever the case this is certainly a film in which literally physical action is important. Kurosawa's use of movement, always an important element in his pictures, is here brought to perfection. Actors pop in and out of the frame, dynamic edits are used for emphasis, and scenes often begin with a burst of action. For Kurosawa this type of construction is not just about creating an exhilarating action picture; the movement is also symbolic of life, vitality and irrepressibility and this is central to the picture.Kurosawa constantly dealt with the conflict between an individual's true value and the constraints of their social status. One of his greatest achievements is revealing the humanity in the most unassuming of people. In Ikiru (1952) Kurosawa had done this as a single character study, turning a middle-aged fuddy-duddy into a hero, but Seven Samurai is an even fuller statement of the notion. First off we have peasants who refuse to accept nasty, brutish and short lives. Then we have the Samurai. Jobless ronin, already considered the scum of feudal Japan, who accept the ultimate humiliation in being employed by peasants rather than a lord. Both peasants and Samurai are changed by their experiences, and shown to be greater people for it. And at the centre of this humanist theme is Kikuchiyo  a man of peasant stock who pretends to be a Samurai. Nothing can change the lowlyness of his birth, but he becomes one of the seven by the way he acts. It's also worth remembering that Kurosawa was a maverick in Japanese cinema, and if he was pointing the finger of one hand at social ills, he was generally pointing the finger of the other hand at his contemporaries in the industry. Just as Seven Samurai tears into Japanese conventions of hierarchy and duty, it also attacks the romanticised, portrayal of feudal loyalty and honour that ran through the Samurai genre. By the way, some knowledge of Japanese culture is helpful in understanding the significance of all this, particularly the status of the jobless Samurai, but it is not a necessity to enjoy the film.In the way that his goal is to humanise his characters, Kurosawa is much like his idol John Ford, and Seven Samurai in fact shares a lot of ground with Ford's Stagecoach. What really strikes me about Seven Samurai however is the depth of characterisation. It is typical in Japanese cinema for there to be around ten central characters, as opposed to three or four in the average western film. But these characters are not simply pieces in a jigsaw puzzle  each has their own issues and their own journey to go on. Kurosawa takes his time in introducing the Samurai characters, with each getting their own very memorable first scene. The four or five peasant characters that we get to know are no less well-rounded and complex, but the way they are presented to us is very different. They instead gradually emerge from the mass of identical looking farmers. By the end we have as much respect for Rikichi and Yohei as we do for Kambei and Kyuzo.There really is no single weak link in Seven Samurai. There is another great musical score Fumio Hayasaka, which manages to capture the diversity of tones in Kurosawa's narrative. The acting performances are all good, and the casting is spot on. Toshiro Mifune really gets to show off the breadth of his range. At times he is snarling beast like in Rashomon, but he later displays a deep humanity, ranting emphatically, making children laugh and breaking down in tears on more than one occasion. It's clear though that it was Kurosawa who really brought out the best in Mifune if you compare this to his performances in, for example, Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Trilogy (made around the same time), which are merely adequate.I'd also like to briefly mention my favourite scene. It's the one where the peasants who live outside the village try to split from the program because their houses will be lost, and the Samurai stop them. It's the very heart of the film for me. Firstly, it explains the importance of working together. It also shows for the first time how the peasants have changed in comparison to those opening scenes. They have gone from a frightened rabble to being confident and organised. The final seconds of this scene are absolutely incredible in their framing and timing  we see the peasants standing proudly in line, the music swells up, Kikuchiyo straightens out the one crooked spear, the music reaches a climax, a gust of wind blows across the scene and fade out. Brilliant.Seven Samurai is a classic because it is one of the fullest, roundest and deepest films ever made. It is one of the few films that scores on every level  excitement, emotion, storytelling and sheer technical quality. It's a great achievement in itself to produce a three-hour plus film that is endlessly watchable and never dull. It represents the first peak in Kurosawa's career, and a high point for cinema as a whole.",Seven Samurai
54,ShootingShark,"You're A Farmer's Son, Aren't You ?",7,27 March 2012,"In feudal Japan, bandits threaten to raid a small village. The farmers resolve to try and find samurai to protect their crops and families. But how will they do this, and can they trust those hired to defend them ?Kurosawa is arguably the top director in all cinema, and this is perhaps his greatest film, although personally I like Yojimbo and Ran even more. It epitomises what makes many of his movies so powerful; it is a both a supremely entertaining story, full of action and humour, but at the same time a riveting, thought-provoking, intelligent drama on the most basic and profound level - life, death, love, honour and morality. So many films are either low-brow mass-market chores or high-brow pretentious bores, it's wonderful to see any movie which succeeds on all levels as both art and entertainment. The story is terrific and beautifully unveiled, the characters are vibrant and dynamic, giving us a choice of people to identify with; the noble and philosophical Kambei (Shimura), the idealistic but naive Katsushiro (Kimura), the noisy comic blowhard Kikuchiyo (Mifune), the quiet but lethal Kyuzo (Miyaguchi), even the short-tempered villager Rikichi (Tsuchiya), whose story is one of the most moving amongst a rich tapestry of overall tales woven skillfully together. All these performances are rich, funny and moving, but it's Mifune's showstopping tour-de-force which lingers most in the mind, full of sound and fury, heartbreaking honesty and great physical prowess. The scene where the weapons cache is found and he chastises the samurai for their bigoted moral superiority packs an incredible emotional punch and for my money is one of the most moving and touching moments in all cinema. The entire film though is packed with great scenes; the standoff with the robber in the barn, Kyuzo's duel, the arrival at the deserted village, the fire at the bandits' hideout, Kikuchiyo holding the baby next to the burning mill, the horses rearing and slipping in the mud, the tragic ending. It's simply outstanding visual storytelling from start to finish. Exceptionally well written by Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni. Remade very successfully by John Sturges in 1960 as The Magnificent Seven (which Kurosawa liked so much he gave Sturges a samurai sword), and its influence casts a huge shadow over hundreds of films, from Da Uomo A Uomo to Three Amigos. If you have any interest in the history of either Japanese cinema or action films generally, this is an absolutely unmissable classic by a master director at the height of his prowess.",Seven Samurai

However the story is not a bad one and the acting isn't even that bad for a film of its time. I could have done with at least one bit of eye candy though.
I can see how this film could inspire many of the films that followed including the Magnificent Seven and Star Wars.

56,valleyjohn,Seven Samurai - My Review,9,27 October 2008,"One of favourite movies of all time is The Magnificent Seven and when this has been mentioned from time to time i have been asked if i had seen the film that it was based on - Seven Samurai , so i finally decided to give it the Valleyjohn Treatment thanks to a request from one of my Myspace friends and i can only thank that person for persuading me to watch this memorable movie. Akira Kurosawa's epic tale concerns honor and duty during a time when the old traditional order is breaking down. The film opens with master samurai Kambei posing as a monk to save a kidnapped farmer's child. Impressed by his selflessness and bravery, a group of farmers begs him to defend their terrorised village from bandits. Kambei agrees, although there is no material gain or honor to be had in the endeavour. Soon he attracts a pair of followers: a young samurai named Katsushiro who quickly becomes Kambei's disciple, and boisterous Kikuchiyo , who poses as a samurai but is later revealed to be the son of a farmer. Kambei assembles four other samurais, including Kyuzo , a master swordsman, to round out the group. Together they consolidate the village's defences and shape the villagers into a militia, while the bandits loom menacingly nearby. Soon raids and counter-raids build to a final bloody heart-wrenching battle.I'm not a big fan of old black and white movies . I used to watch many as a kid but as i have got older i have found i have not really got the patience for them. Because of that , Seven Samurai was always going to be a difficult film for me to watch. Not because of it's content but because of the length - Three hours and nine minutes! So to stop me drifting i decided i would watch the movie in two parts and because of that decision i really enjoyed this epic movie. You can see many comparisons with the Magnificent seven . The Samurai all have distinctive characters and you can see the comparison to the Yul Brynner and Robert Vaughn roles from the 1960 film but despite the comparison's they are very different movies. Seven Samurai is a far more brutal movie than the Western version but it also has some very poignant moments. None more so than the very last scene where the surviving Samurai are standing at the gravesides of their fallen comrades.The performance from Takashi Shimura ( Kambei the samurai leader ) and Toshiro Mifune ( the crazy Samurai) are very memorable and at times i completely forgot i was watching a film that was made 54 years ago.Although film purist's will rate this higher than the John Sturges remake i still prefer the Cowboy v Mexican version but i grew up watching that film so that is to be expected.Seven Samurai is definitely going to be one of those films that will be embedded on my brain for the rest of my life and the split viewing was well worth it in the end.I will leave you with the thoughts of Kikuchiyo - ""What do you think of farmers? You think they're saints? Hah! They're foxy beasts! They say, ""We've got no rice, we've no wheat. We've got nothing!"" But they have! They have everything! Dig under the floors! Or search the barns! You'll find plenty! Beans, salt, rice, sake! Look in the valleys, they've got hidden warehouses! They pose as saints but are full of lies! If they smell a battle, they hunt the defeated! They're nothing but stingy, greedy, blubbering, foxy, and mean!""Nothing changes does it!",Seven Samurai
57,Spleen,What can anyone add?,10,18 July 2001,"Some films are so good that their length becomes a virtue in itself - you're grateful for every minute, every hour, that they last.  Such films usually seem longer than they are.  In fact, all the very best films seem longer than they are.Kurosawa's story doesn't just progress, it grows.  It starts as the story of two farmers attempting to persuade just one samurai to help them; when this one samurai is found, it turns into the story of the farmers and the samurai recruiting other samurai; when everyone is recruited, it turns into the story of how the samurai defend the farmers' village.  Each of these three stories, while it lasts, feels like the REAL story.  But the subsequent story is always longer, more complex and more fulfilling.  This is much harder to pull off than it sounds.Of all Kurosawa films this one probably has the most prints in circulation, so there's no excuse for not seeing it on a big screen.",Seven Samurai

Akira Kurosawa is right at the top of Japanese auteurs and Seven Samurai is one of the best of the best.It is a long movie and that makes it difficult to watch in one go and therefore I suggest to break it up into 2 or 3 parts as that's how I managed to finish it. Yes, it can be a bit slow sometimes but more often than not there's something interesting happening to keep you engaged.Seven Samurai is the blueprint Samurai movie and has been adapted in various forms in all of world cinema. However, I believe this movie would hardly have fared as well if not for Toshiro Mifune's character of the drunk, over the top samurai.An interesting fact about this is that according to actor Toshiro Mifune, the film was originally going to be called Six Samurai, with Mifune playing the role of Kyuzo. During the six-week scriptwriting process, Kurosawa and his screenwriters realized that ""six sober samurai were a bore-they needed a character that was more off-the-wall"". Kurosawa recast Mifune as Kikuchiyo and gave him creative license to improvise actions in his performance.Do watch if given the chance. The battle scenes are simply a treat to watch and a lot of films owe their success to Seven Samurai.",Seven Samurai
60,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Shichinin no samurai (1954),10,3 May 2005,"What can one say about the legend that is Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai'? Well it is my favourite film of all time. If i'm asked for my opinion, I would have to say it is quite perfect. Kurosawa pretty much invents the modern action film we are all familiar with. He brings together a team of highly skilled hard-men, each with their own distinct characteristics. They are hired by a small village, in order to protect them from bandits who will soon come and steal the harvest. The samurai arrive in the town, being promised a place to stay and three meals a day. They start to work out tactics and train the farmers. The beauty of this film is first present by the fact that it is over three hours long but flies by faster than many films that struggle to make two hours. Watching 'Seven Samurai' never feels like a chore. Kurosawa also perfectly mixes everything like a perfect recipe. There is hilarious moments of comedy, supplied by the brilliant Toshiro Mifune and the quick witted Minoru Chiaki. Also a very sweet romance blossoms, and never feels as though it is bringing down the rest of the film. Kurosawa also makes sure to never show anybody as perfect, the victims (farmers) prey upon wondering samurai, like those they now need. The ferocious killing of one of the captured bandits is also quite disturbing as the samurai's are against the killing. Each character is well explored and serves a specific purpose, the film clearly shows how the samurai would not be successful if they had any less men. The performances are nothing short of spectacular, with Mifune as the eccentric and misunderstood hero, and Takashi Shimura as the reserved and warm leader. The film also has its fair share of brilliant action sequences, such as the early slow motion sword fights that reveal the samurai's skills. Kurosawa paces the film perfectly, and uses the locales to his advantage. Despite being in black and white the film seems as though it is in colour due to the clear spaces and use of scenery. The script is excellent, with each piece of dialogue being important to the story. Sure the film could easily be less than two hours. Villagers hire samurai, they train for a bit, and have a battle. However 'Seven Samurai' never feels like it is outstaying its welcome. The final battle is amazing and exciting with the rain pouring down, the numbers against the samurai, and the brilliant use of editing techniques thanks to Kurosawa's multiple cameras. Overall this film is beyond explanation, there is too much and it is simply perfect, fantastic, amazing. Watch it, experience it, love it.",Seven Samurai

One day after an attack they seek the wisdom of an elder who tells them they cannot afford weapons, but they can find men with weapons, samurai, who will fight for them, if they find samurai who are in down on their luck and wondering where their next meal will come from. They find a very experienced samurai with a good heart who agrees to recruit their party for them. He selects five genuine samurai and one who is suspect but the seven return to the village to protect it from the forty plus bandits.If you could only watch one film in your lifetime, this one is it. Yes that's a pretty bold statement, but it's true. Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is a must see for any film fan. Kurosawa brought so many elements together for this film that it is on such a grand an epic scale.Each samurai has their own arc to them, from being the experienced warrior to a young hopeful. Kurosawa takes his time to develop each character on his/her own terms and it works wonderfully. The film is extremely long and the epic battler doesn't take place till the final part of the film, but here we get to know our Seven Samurai, all of them, very well. We care for each, not wanting them to die in the heat of the battle, for a film to be able to do this for one character is great, but for seven....is extraordinary.Samurai is a dazzlingly technical achievement for it's time and to this day outshines most ""epic"" movies we see today. It has beautiful cinematography and art direction. Kurosawa has a keen eye and uses it well in this film.Samurai has one of if not the most amazing battle put to screen. The samurai turn the village into a fortress and use the surroundings to their help. The battle is so massive it spawns roughly 30 some odd minutes. The climatic battle itself goes through every rock that mother nature throws it's way, from the cold dirty rain to the hot dry day. It has influenced all the films we see today, The Return of The King, The Magnificent Seven, Narnia. Please don't see this film expecting BRAVEHEART, because there will be no limbs flying off the screen. But the action is beautifully filmed and shows early use of slow-motion.Samurai packs an emotional punch at the end, as it shows how the samurai are honorable, we have been on this journey with them since their beginning to their end and we cannot help but feel sorrow for the ones lost in the battle. We feel sorrow for the Samurai because in the end they get nothing, yes the village is safe and the enemy is gone, but the only thing the samurai get is a loss in numbers.Samurai is a landmark film that has it's place in history as one of the greatest. For those that can't comprehend it, think of it as Japan's Citizen Kane....only better. For a film that has inspired so many and given us so much, there is only praise to be said. For if it were not for this film, we may not be where we are today in cinema.",Seven Samurai
62,winner55,necessary film,10,1 August 2006,"general statement of principle; I am sick to death of commercial filmmakers preying on the young by obscuring the fact that, as filmmakers, they have nothing original to say or do, by chewing up the past and spitting it out again with ""new, improved"" special FX.yet, judging from some of the reviews i read here the sad fact is that many young viewers are not only ignorant of film history, they earnestly wish to remain ignorant.what could possibly be gained by a surrender to one's own ignorance. an ignorant man has to be told what to do and what to think. simply rejecting the advice of one's elders does not constitute freedom of thought - it is exactly when we reach a decision contrary to that of our peers that we discover what it may mean to become an individual.this means, of course, that statistical arguments concerning the uselessness of history are wholly unconvincing. to say that 'most people agree with me on this point' doesn't say that the point is well-made; possible everyone in agreement with it is simply wrong.to assert one's independence and then turn around and say that the 'majority agree' is self-evidently contradictory. to abide by such statements despite evidence and reasonable disproof, is not simply exposing ignorance m- which can be corrected through education - it is simply stupid.furthermore, since an ignorant person has to be told what to think, it follows that such a person is a victim waiting for a crime to happen. such people seem proud of their ability to thumb their noses at people who reach out to help - but they easily and quickly fall victim to con-artists, who usually know how to make such people feel good about the victimization.knowledge of history means; not getting scammed for want of it. it means deepening one's awareness of the strengths and faults of those we admire. it means that we learn the tricks used to produce something of value, thus making it easier to find and judge value.in film it is also well to bear in mind that good film-makers are precisely those who have studied film history the most. this gives them a stock of film-techniques developed by others on which to draw for increased effectiveness of their own films. i find it unclear, why it is young viewers of today wish to remain in ignorance of where the contemporary film-maker draws inspiration.this fact blasts away the commonly proffered assertion, 'we do things better now than anything they did 'back when'. if that were true, then the film-makers of today would not need such inspiration; but they do.finally, it is simply a fact that those who profess ignorance - as a desirable quality - are simply incapable of saying anyone might be able to learn. they always get basic facts wrong.the seven samurai; is not an action film, it is a period adventure film with both action elements but also, and more importantly, elements of serious drama.i read one young reviewer say that the character development in the seven samurai is unimportant. obviously this person just doesn't like people; so i supposed he will eventually betray his friends or get betrayed.because the importance of the character development in the first half of this film is that some of us happen to like human beings and want to understand better what makes them do the things they do - and what makes some of their actions mistakes - sometimes fatal mistakes.as the remarks of the lead samurai imply, the biggest mistake this men made was becoming samurai. but that being the hand life has dealt them, they need to play it out as best they can - and as gracefully as they can.Hemingway once remarked that what truly made a man was 'grace under fire' - and i seem to recall he admitted that he had heard of this as a volunteer with the Italian army during the first world war, that this was the quality the Italians admired most about Americans.well, that's what this film is about - not the action, but the 'grace under fire' that the samurai learn about themselves, and also teach the villagers. or those villagers willing to be taught. when someone is not willing to be taught, that one is not worthy of teaching - in which case bandits can rape, rob, and slaughter them, and no one would care.finally one must point out the tasteless ignorance of insisting that a film is weak because - heaven forbid - it's not in color. that's sort of like saying 'your father's a fag because he hasn't gotten your mom pregnant in years'. - it is wholly irrelevant to any movie whatsoever, to be sure, a director can handle color well - but he or she can handle black and white lighting and composition equally well.there is no 'nature photography' in the seven samurai. there are stunningly beautiful and haunting images in black and white.if you care about film, you owe it to yourself to see the film; had it never been made, neither would any contemporary films that you enjoy today, or that you may enjoy tomorrow.and if that doesn't sink in - then, screw it - i've no patience for fools.still one of the best films in the history of cinema, and still a film necessary to see and appreciate.",Seven Samurai

66,sme_no_densetsu,Among the best foreign films,8,19 February 2012,"Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" is generally regarded as one of the crown jewels of world cinema. This epic (3½ hour) film tells the story of a group of samurai recruited by poor farmers in order to defend their village against a group of bandits. Seven accept the challenge, despite the promise of hard times and little reward.Despite being over three hours in length, there isn't a wasted moment in the film. We're introduced to the bandit threat in the opening scene and the buildup to their return is filled with character development. By the time the conflict starts resulting in casualties, we've grown attached to these characters and hate to see them go. And once the real action finally does start, it's unrelenting.The cast is well assembled and includes Japanese film legends Toshirô Mifune & Takashi Shimura. While I found Mifune's portrayal of the brash Kikuchiyo to be a bit over-the-top there's no denying that he has tremendous screen presence. Shimura's performance is much more subdued as he provides an ideal personification of samurai values. Other standouts include Seiji Miyaguchi as master swordsman Kyûzô, Yoshio Tsuchiya as defiant villager Rikichi and Isao Kimura as the young and inexperienced Katsushirô.The direction by Kurosawa is uniformly well handled whether in the heat of battle or in a more peaceful moment (though I can't say I cared for his use of slow motion). The film also boasts some nice cinematography which makes the most of costumes & sets that convincingly establish the period setting. Meanwhile, the music of Fumio Hayasaka sets the right tone throughout.In the end, I would have rated this movie a bit higher except that I grew up with the Western remake ""The Magnificent Seven"" and it remains one of my absolute favourite movies of all time. So, for me at least, while the original is a top notch movie, I can't help but compare it to the slightly superior (in my mind) remake. Of course, this preference may or may not be completely objective.",Seven Samurai
67,pyrocitor,A triangle amidst circles,10,21 April 2010,"The term 'masterpiece' tends to be bandied around to a notoriously excessive extent in reactions to contemporary cinema, but if ever there was a film which unquestionably deserved the label, Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai would be it. Anchored by a simple narrative of a troop of samurai banding together to protect and train a village of farmers from bandit raids, Kurosawa's film extrapolates beyond the mere telling of a story to the foundation of a legend - it is easy to imagine a comparison between a community of audiences seated and enraptured throughout the better part of an afternoon or evening and an indigenous tribe, seated around a fire and passing down their foundational stories and history to a new generation. Kurosawa's film is one which demands attention, but does so without pretension or contrived pitches for trite sentiment - in short, the rare picture which allows its peerless quality to speak for itself.The staple pitch for an 'epic' film of any sort of late is 'synergy between a grandiose scale and conflict and intimate emotional focus', yet Kurosawa's film could have written the book on such a balance. Thinking back over the experience shortly after finishing its exhaustingly tense and thrilling culminating battle (itself cementing the film as essential viewing), it is almost easy to forget how the film draws its primary focus from the exploration of and interactions between its characters, weaving a sumptuous tapestry of very real people and problems, a microcosm of conflict thickened by the noxious looming of the inevitable clash with the bandits. However, proving that spectacle and characterisation not need be mutually exclusive, Kurosawa also delivers what is without doubt one of the most stunning combat films of all time, breathlessly allowing the audience to be privy to the samurai's battle plans and combat formations before allowing all hell to break loose with the cathartic thundering fury of the madness and ferocious joy of war. Nonetheless, for a film largely painting in thundering broad strokes, the complexity, nuance and ambiguity of Kurosawa's work is almost left in the shadows of the 'bigger' moments. It is telling that one of the most moving moments in a film littered with them takes place offscreen, almost an aside, and told with 'blink-and-miss-it' subtlety: reflecting on a barely thwarted bandit raid, the samurai notice the absence of one of their number, the live wire, loose cannon Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune). One samurai mumbles that Kikuchiyo is numbly sitting next to the grave of a fallen comrade, an uncharacteristic show of sentiment revealing a previously unseen emotional side to the near deranged fighter. A conventional approach would show provide the image of a grieving Kikuchiyo alone with the grave, yet Kurosawa wisely elects to 'tell not show', thus both giving the viewer a sense of immersion into the plot, forcing them to gracefully respect Kikuchiyo's privacy along with the other samurai and allowing the imagination to instill the scene with all the more power and surging emotion. To see such insight and delicacy of touch in a film boasting such overwhelming dramatic power is the mark of a true genius, and every aspect of Kurosawa's opus is marked with so unique and knowing a flavour of quality, from the astonishingly gorgeous cinematography and composition of shots, the alternatively solemn and playful editing (any familiar with Star Wars' characteristic scene wipes will note Kurosawa's influence),the immaculately recreated period costuming and sets, and Fumio Hayasaka's boldly dramatic musical score, perfectly blending the dignity and power of tradition with the quirkiness and fun of modernity.Even if solely predicated as a character study of wild warrior Kukushiyo, the film could regardless make its mark as an all time classic, as Toshirô Mifune's stunning performance is truly one for the ages. Assigned an already compelling mix of triumph and disgrace, Mifune amps up his charisma and eccentricities to the point of near insanity, not chewing the scenery as much as devouring it. Yet behind the simian hooting and hopping and defiant snarl of laugh, there lies genuine yearning and pain behind Kikuchiyo's eyes, and Mifune is careful to never allow his character's repellent or sympathetic elements to outweigh the other, but instead blending them together with the result of a certifiable triumph and testament towards the impact of an actor's interpretation. The rest of the cast deliver unanimously stellar and often admirably colourful performances, headed up by the incredible serenity and coiled power of Takashi Shimura as the dignified lead samurai Shimada. To retain an audience's interest throughout a three and a half hour film would be a feat in itself, yet the genius of Kurosawa's film is not that it successfully campaigns for attention but rather that the viewer forgets they are watching a film at all, so utterly immersed are they from the chilling opening to bittersweet and sardonically joyful closing. Seven Samurai epitomizes the term masterpiece in every sense of the word, and should be considered essential viewing, if only for the sake of demonstration of the true potential and peerless power of cinema.-10/10",Seven Samurai
68,Cosmoeticadotcom,Fantastic,10,17 September 2008,"Some films do get better with repeated viewings. Akira Kurosawa's 1954 black and white film Seven Samurai (Shichinin no samurai) is one of them. It was well deserving of winning the 1954 Venice Film Festival's Silver Lion, as well as the two Academy awards it won for Best Art/Set Decoration and Best Costume Design. On a first view it's simply a great action film, but with subsequent viewings the finer points of characterization come through in each moment, seeping into the mind subliminally and purposefully. The story, at nearly three and a half hours in length- including a five minute intermission, is never weighted down with fat, as all of the many subplots bear fruit- so unlike most films made in Hollywood today. It became an international sensation, and the highest grossing Japanese film of its day.Yes, there are remnants of the stale samurai genre, such as the wise man Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura), and the 'boy on the verge of manhood' in Katsushiro Okamoto (Isao 'Ko' Kimura), and his romance with farmer Manzo's daughter Shino, but the central human dilemma of the 16th Century farmers who are helpless against the depredations of the bandits, who abound during the civil wars of the era, raises the film above mere clichés. We only see the bandits at the beginning and end of the film. There are about two hours where the meat of the tale takes place, and not a bandit is in sight. How many films do away with their bad guys for so long? How many could afford to? Since we do not know any of the bandits' names, they are more like a singular character, or a sheer force of nature. Why do they keep coming to attack the villagers, even as their forces are successively thinned with each failed raid? They must realize that the once helpless villagers have hired defenders? There is no Darth Vader among the bandits, despite George Lucas's latter-day attempts to cite this film as an influence for his banal and downright puerile Star Wars saga. We also learn that the villagers are neither as poor nor innocent as they portray. There are murderers amongst them, who have killed samurai before. They also seek to lowball and underpay their protectors. It is a truism that almost all great directors have at least one great collaborator. With Ingmar Bergman it was his cinematographer Sven Nykvist. With Federico Fellini it was his musical scorer, Nino Rota. But with Kurosawa it's not only great stars like Mifune and Shimura, but his co-writers, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni- part of a rotating staff of writers that muted some of Kurosawa's own admitted over the top tendencies in storytelling, and brought the tale down to a human level. Without them the film may have been little more than a greatly stylized genre film, rather than a great film, period.The cinematography Asakazu Nakai, and score by Fumio Hayasaka are also very good, although this is an actor-driven vehicle. Nakai's deep focus techniques- at the time cutting edge, are every bit as good as those in Citizen Kane. Especially, look at the complexity of the many crowd scenes, where many little stories play out as we watch the foregrounded action of the samurai. Things like this are only gotten on repeated viewings, and with my second viewing I picked up much more than on a first glance, especially while not having to read the subtitles. And look at how jungle twigs seem to leap out at the viewer, as does Mifune's huge phallic sword as he slings it over his shoulder. The whole film was shot in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, so one wonders what Kurosawa would have done with this film in widescreen.There's no doubt that Seven Samurai is a great film, and with its length and complexity it will only grow in my estimation as I view it more and more over the years. Of that I'm sure. But, that said, I do not think that it is Kurosawa's best film. I'd still lean toward Ikiru for that honor- for it's simply the more deeply human tale, and Shimura is even better in his role as Watanabe the doomed bureaucrat than as Kambei the indefatigable warrior. However, this is the granddaddy of all great action films, from Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch to even James Cameron's films like Aliens or The Terminator series, as well as a great bildungsroman for Katsushiro. It also struck me, as the film opens to drumbeats, how reminiscent this film's opening is to that of my beloved Godzilla- a film that was released in the same year, with the footfalls of the monster dominating a black screen filled with credits. While Godzilla is nowhere in a league to Seven Samurai as a film, it is the second most influential Japanese film of all time. That both rely on such primal sounds in their openings makes one wonder if there's a connection.Yet, the thing that Seven Samurai has that few other films do is its incredibly detailed richness. From the bad skull caps the male characters wear, to the ambush tests Kambei devises to recruit his cohorts, to the old woman who goes to kill a hobbled bandit with a farm instrument- to avenge her son's death, and many others; all of these and more make repeated viewing a necessity to truly appreciate this film, for all of these things are non-essential to the basic plot, even as they heighten the realism of this unreal tale. Let me end by stating that Seven Samurai is every bit as good, and great, as its greatest champions claim, and I ask you, how rare a thing is that?",Seven Samurai

70,bobsgrock,"""It is when we feel our safest we are most vulnerable.""",10,15 December 2008,"Perhaps the greatest Japanese film of all time and one of the best foreign films ever, Seven Samurai more than compensates for the 3 1/2 hour run time that holds us in its grasp. Some parts may feel a bit stretched or contrived, but the action sequences are absolutely thrilling cinema and some of the best ever shot on screen. Director Akira Kurosawa used multiple cameras to shoot these scenes, and as a result, the pace flows wonderfully and they look great.The acting is also very good, with Takashi Shimura shining as the leader Kambei. However, the best role is that of Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favorite muse and longtime partner in acting. His turn as the outsider samurai is truly impressive to watch as he prowls around like a lion full of energy, sensuality and fearlessness. There is also a very sweet and tender romance amidst all the hatred and violence that escalates to the climax.As mentioned before, this isn't an easy film to watch with the 200 minute running time and foreign language. But, if you take the time to watch it, you will witness a landmark in international cinema as perhaps the first action-adventure epic in movie history as well as a timeless story of honor, courage, and selflessness that defines a hero.",Seven Samurai

72,TheUnknown837-1,Kurosawa's most influential film and one of the greatest motion pictures ever to grace the screen,10,24 December 2008,"At the time I wrote this review, Akira Kurosawa had recently, and very quickly, become one of my all-time favorite directors. I had only seen four of his films and given each and every one of them my highest rating. His greatest, and undoubtedly his most popular film was in 1954 epic Seven Samurai, which was the top-selling movie out of Japan for the year and won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it's ranked one of the greatest motion pictures ever. And it rightfully holds that title.This is a spectacular film. Full of wonderful characters, spectacular scenery, and great performances all around, it is Kurosawa's fantastic story about a poor farming village in 16th century Japan being consistently placed under attack by marauding bandits. Facing starvation if the bandits raid them again, the peasants fearfully and reluctantly turn to seven unemployed samurai to defend themselves.There is no weak element to Seven Samurai. One of its greatest aspects is its characters. Every single one of them, farmer or samurai, is given tremendous development, making them memorable. This is one of those films where if a character gets killed off, you suddenly find yourselves missing their presence on film because you got to know them so well. I will not name him, but there was one ill-fated character in the film when, after he died, I felt kind of cheerless because I had come to respect him as a human being instead of an actor performing in front of a camera and reading out scripted dialogue. If you were to ask me which character was my favorite, I would be tied between two of them. The characters played by Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, two of the finest Japanese actors who ever lived.Another thing I admire in Seven Samurai is the feeling of authenticity. The feeling that it all could have really happened. There are very few moments where the unbelievable occurs, as most action movies tend to succumb to. One thing I admired was the antagonists of the film: the bandits. Unlike most Hollywood movies where the bad guys have names and are introduced as characters to make them effective, the bandits in Seven Samurai all go without names. We only know them as ""the bandits"" and that is appropriate because that's all the characters know them as. Just marauding, murdering bandits who must be killed off as soon as possible.Kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time and that is clear in this film. Many of the transitions and techniques that motion pictures today seem to follow on a conventional level were inspired by this film: slow-motion, a ""fade"" wipe between scenes like what you see in the Star Wars movies, using the weather to affect emotion and atmosphere, a team forming to take on a larger enemy, the list goes on. The movie was so influential that it was remade here in the United States as The Magnificent Seven (1960), which I consider one of the greatest remakes ever. Not as good as its original sourcenot by a long shotbut considerably effective and noteworthy.In regards to the movie's soundtrack, it's a success. The music was composed by Fumio Hayasaka and it's wonderful. We seldom hear any of it, when we do, its an efficacious presence of impact. The opening score is very effective and the music that plays when the farmers are searching for samurai in the town remains one of my favorite soundtrack pieces today.There is one thing in the film that might warn off some viewers. It is long. At over three and a half hours in length, some people will be cautious before sitting down to view it and some will lose their patience, but to those who can sit down and enjoy a movie no matter how long it lasts, it will be realized as fast-moving storytelling. Like The Ten Commandments (1956), even the long takes and the slow pacing seems fast because it is so well-written and so masterfully directed by Kurosawa.One of the greatest masterpieces of all time. And now that it's been released in a wonderful three-disc collection here in the United States, its audience will continue to expand and its legacy will live on. That's the only kind of fate a masterpiece should have.",Seven Samurai
73,mstomaso,"After 53 Years, Still Fresh",9,29 July 2008,"The great Akira Kurosawa's epic action masterpiece ""Seven Samurai"" is an entertaining and thoughtful war epic set in 19th century Japan. Replete with colorful well-realized characters, and sensitively portrayed social and class analysis, Kurosawa's film entertains on all levels. Although not as visually engaging as many of Kurosawa's later efforts, Seven Samurai's cinematography is still masterful, and well above most contemporary films.A farmer overhears some bandits talking about raiding his village as soon as the next harvest is ready and approaches an older Samurai master who is on the verge of retirement for help. The elder Samurai, recognizing the humility of the request and the dignity of the proposed work, takes up the cause and begins recruiting others for the defense of the village. He recruits five Samurai and takes on a young apprentice and a drunken, angry would-be Samurai avenger (Toshirô Mifune ... Kikuchiyo) as the sixth and seventh members of his newly established militia. The Samurai live among the villagers for most of a growing season, teaching them defense and discipline. In turn, the villagers - as fearful of the Samurai as they are in awe of them, hide away their daughters and some of their stores. As the inevitable crisis ensues, these two widely disparate classes of people learn to live and fight together to defend their homes and their crops.Kurosawa's film is as much social realism as it is martial historic fantasy. Their is also a steady supply of humor and an entertaining romance - both of which are relatively rare in this genre. In summary, Seven Samurai is one of those rare works of art which takes on a vast scope and sustains it with apparent facility.Highly recommended.",Seven Samurai
74,gftbiloxi,One of the Finest Films of the 20th Century,10,1 April 2005,"Clocking in at just under four hours with not a scrap of filler, Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI is every bit as legendary at its enthusiasts would have you believe.The basic story is extremely simple. In a period of social chaos, a small farming village learns it will once more be attacked by a band of thirty bandits after the harvest. At first the farmers despair, but village elder Gisaku (Kokuten Kodo) recalls that in his childhood a similar village met a similar situation by hiring Samurai to defend them. The villagers accordingly send representatives to the city, where they are able to convince Samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) to undertake the defense.If the plot sounds familiar, it should: Hollywood would translate it into the extremely popular 1960 western THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN--but fine though that film is, it pales beside THE SEVEN SAMURAI, which effectively turns an action film premise into a character study of the first order and endows the story with both tremendous simplicity and artistry. Much of this is due an extraordinary ensemble cast, which includes the celebrated Toshiro Mifune (who would later appear in Kurosawa's THRONE OF BLOOD and YOJIMBO); above this, however, is Kurosawa's remarkable vision that draws upon the visual motif of the circle.The circle is a powerful presence in SAMURAI. The village is presented as a roughly circular pattern of houses; the farmers meet in circles; in due time the Samurai enter the circle and stand at the center of the circle, directing the defense--and indeed the circle will become the defense, as Shimada works to find means to draw the bandits into the circle and to their doom. The motif will be elaborated: tied to the cycle of seed time, growth time, and harvest; tied to the cycle of life; and ultimately showing the quiet bitterness of life for those who operate outside the circular codes of community: the ""Ronin,"" the Samurai who have no master and no community, and whose lives are not valued by the community except for aid at a moment of crisis.Shot in simple black and white, as much (if not more) a detailed character and culture study as it is an action film, THE SEVEN SAMURAI is extremely simple and yet extremely subtle, and ultimately one of the most powerful films it has been my pleasure to review. The quality of the Criterion DVD transfer is very good, but by no means flawless--although it survives well, the film has not been digitally restored, and artifacts are frequent. There is little in the way of bonus material, but the commentary by Michael Jeck is quite fine. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Seven Samurai

Akira Kurosawa on the other hand made the official one and it's so much more, he made a simple story something larger and interesting. It's also his first samurai film. The imagery, art direction and cinematography are just incredible and superb. Talented people behind the production, you see it in every scene how well made it is. The musical score is another thing that's fantastic, it's one of many things that immerses you into the movie. So are the props and sets who were used.Akira Kurosawa directed and wrote the movie, possibly his Magnum Opus, this or Ran. What I loved with the movie was how he took the time with introducing the seven samurai, they are all different and the time we get before the action is appreciated as we get to know them and there's time for many character interactions and development. The cast of the Seven Samurai are great, each person doing great performances. Toshirô Mifune's character is the most unique, he shows of acting capabilities and the comedic side which I've grown to love. The dialogue and script are just perfect, mixing in great comedic dialogue and then the heavy and incredible that leaves you speechless. Poetic in a way.The battle has the samurai and farmers against the ruthless bandits, it were not how I imagined it and I'm glad it was done the way it was done as it lead to more personal fights and real defensive fighting with traps and strategy. Shows that strategy wins. It was a perfect ending to a spectacular movie.

79,FilmOtaku,Brilliant and groundbreaking,9,27 September 2004,"Akira Kurosawa's film 'Seven Samurai' is another one of those films that most people recognize as one of the greatest ever, without ever even seeing the film first; just solely based on its reputation. Admittedly, I was one of those people, so I was delighted to find that, when finally seeing this film, I finally have the experience to back up my opinion.'Seven Samurai', written and directed by Kurosawa, tells the tale of a small village in Japan in the 1600's that is plagued by bandits who take their food supply, not leaving enough for the villagers to survive on. When they discover that the bandits will strike again after their rice crop is harvested, they decide to take the few possessions they own and employ samurai to defend the village. Seven samurai are eventually recruited, and they help the villagers learn to defend themselves, while dealing with clashing values, traditions and perceptions.My synopsis of the plot does not begin to do justice to this incredible story. Kurosawa spins a rich and intertwining tale that is at times dramatic, and at others, hilariously funny. While I have no idea who 90% of the actors are, Kurosawa's 'muse', I was thrilled to see Toshiro Mifune playing a samurai who is a loose cannon and all around nutcase. Having seen Mifune in only serious roles, most notably in Kurosawa's 'High and Low' it was a very entertaining surprise. In terms of the film itself, Kurosawa's direction is nearly flawless. Despite its three and a half hour run time, the pacing was perfect and there were no points where the film lagged. While the film is about samurai, and the perception of the general public in recent decades may have changed since the 1950's, 'Seven Samurai' is mostly story and not a lot of hard action (of course, look at the decade we're also dealing with), although there was one really slick fight scene when Kurosawa filmed a shot in slow motion that made me howl. There is really no comparing the remake of this film, 'The Magnificent Seven' because while the story is similar, just about everything else is different. However, after watching 'The Magnificent Seven', then 'Seven Samurai' (both for the first time, on the same night) I was struck by how much more emotional I was during several scenes in 'Seven Samurai' than their equivalent scenes in the former film. Both in terms of dramatic acting and dialogue, and the respectful and beautiful framing of shots by Kurosawa, 'Seven Samurai' packed a much bigger emotional wallop for me.Every time I watch a film off of the IMDb 250 or the AFI 100, I take an admittedly ridiculous amount of time to examine its merit in its place on the list, or whether it deserves to be on the list at all. Obviously, the films closest to #1 get the most scrutiny, and 'Seven Samurai' was the only film in top 20 that I hadn't yet seen. While I don't agree with several of the films in the top 10 being placed ahead of my personal favorite film, 'Citizen Kane', after seeing 'Seven Samurai' I believe it should solidly be placed exactly where it is. It is a groundbreaking film that stands up fifty years later. Whether or not you have seen the film, try to catch it on the Criterion DVD  I have seen clips of the film before, and unfortunately the prints were damaged and scratched. The Criterion transfer is absolutely gorgeous, so seek it out.--Shelly",Seven Samurai
80,charlytully,Why SAMURAI is 25% better than THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN,10,22 July 2009,"Having recently rented both THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (the American remake of SEVEN SAMURAI) and RAN (7S director Akira Kurosawa's later take on Shakespeare's KING LEAR), it is somewhat tempting to compare 7S to both. However, I will restrain myself and restrict my comment to perhaps the more apt comparison: SEVEN SAMURAI vs. THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.ACTION: The Japanese original wins here hands down. In 7S, the villagers attack and destroy the bandits' hideout BETWEEN bandit attacks on their village, motivating the surviving 33 bad guys to PLAUSIBLY fight to the last man, which they end up doing. Since 7S relies more on hand-to-hand combat than M7 (which is dominated by gun play), the earlier film is much more gritty and believable in its more extensive battle scenes.MUSICAL SCORING: This one is a tie. Both movies feature exceptional scores. While M7 has one of the most hummable themes ever, 7S has a strong samurai motif in its own right, plus great use of portentous percussive rhythms from the opening credits onward.COMIC RELIEF: Another tie, though this one is likely to find many viewers choosing the movie from the cultural tradition in which they are most comfortable.ROMANTIC INTEREST: Here, a cursory glance would perhaps award a nod to M7, since the youngest samurai seems to be (figuratively) miles away from the village lass he'd earlier compromised by the time the closing scene rolls around, while M7 ends with the comparable gunfighter not only in his lover's arms, but preparing for a life in agriculture. However, I would give the edge to 7S, which would have lost much credibility for an M7-type close, given its historical setting in feudal Japan. A bigger factor in S7's superiority here is the pathos evoked by the story of farmer Rikishi and his wife, which begins in mystery (to the viewer, as well as the samurai) and ends in tragedy. Not every love story can have a happy ending, particularly in believable action movies.SUMMARY: These are just a few of the reasons why I rated SEVEN SAMURAI (at 10 out of 10) 25% higher than director John Sturges' 1960 remake, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.",Seven Samurai
81,EijnarAmadeus,Kurosawa's epic masterpiece which draws much of its plot and characters from Western Cinema,9,19 May 2008,"SEVEN SAMURAI is a requested view; this is the movie where Hollywood got one-upped by Akira Kurosawa, a Japenese director who had earned himself international respect after 1950's Rashomon. The movie tells the story of a village under attack by merciless bandits, in despair they hire seven samurais to protect them - its a classic plot, but never before 1954 had any Western movie appeared with an ensemble of heroes, and at well three hours' runtime it has time to tell rich characterizations. The film speaks to the defeated people of 1954, who regarded the Americans as much as the villagers regards both the bandits and the super-powered samurais.

84,elvircorhodzic,"""Danger always strikes when everything seems fine.""",10,16 November 2016,"SEVEN SAMURAI is an unusual and exotic movie. This movie, to me, has one of the best scenes of battles in the history of cinema. Drama, adventure and tragedy are not the point of this film. The point is related to the role and duty of every person in the society through which reveal the human strengths and weaknesses. Set is in Japan in 1587, and in the Sengoku period when the country devastated army mutually warring feudal clans and bandit gangs. The protagonists are seven poor samurai without masters (ronin), which the inhabitants of a village to hire as they tried to protect them from the gangs that loot every year.The story is great and rich details perfectly describe all the characters. Characterization is phenomenal. Scenery is simply superb. Throughout the movie, the permeate incidents, or physical calculations which are accompanied with strong emotions. The thrills are constant. All the protagonists can be divided into three groups. The peasants, samurai and the bandits. Three different cultural beliefs and three different relationships to the community and the conflict eventually come to the same - raw survival.Interestingly, the samurai is part of strict Japanese tradition, and again in this film are the most humane and flexibility. The traditional aspect is evident from the relationship. Villagers are equally afraid of the samurai and the bandits. I will not say that the samurai performed their duties (which are paid with a handful of rice). In this film they made a precedent. Looking in that direction, in the film there are two major incidents. Very brave and even more crazy son of a farmer who presents himself as a samurai and love between a young samurai and village girl. This is simply the nature of society. This can be observed at the end of the film. The villagers return to their daily routine, the village is saved, and for them the samurai no longer exist.The acting is strong and emotional in this film.Takashi Shimura as Kambei Shimada is a true leader, a wise and persistent in order to do the job .... and more. Modesty and organizations are virtues. Toshiro Mifune as Kikuchiyo again in the mad performance. Exceptional power, emotion and temperament are his qualities. He is the link between the samurai and peasant. His racket has its own purpose. In addition, he is the funniest character in the film. Keiko Tsushima as Shino is young and extremely beautiful. Visibly frightened, but very passionate and brave peasant girl. The daughter who issued a father for the sake of love.I'll admit, Seven Samurai is one of my favorite movies.",Seven Samurai
85,ofpsmith,Watch this and then his other movies.,10,21 December 2019,"Anyone who has even a slight interest in movies has likely come across this film several times. Akira Kurosawa is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time and Seven Samurai is a staple to his genius at the craft. Everything about this film from the story to the acting to the characters to the cinematography is crafted to almost perfection. During the Japanese Sengoku period of civil war and anarchy a poor village under constant threat from bandits makes up a resolution to hire samurai to fend them. After some initial trouble finding ronin who will accept a job with no real reward or benefit a team is finally assembled. It's the ultimate underdog story of tragedy, triumph, and even a few laughs. One of the best films ever made and one of the templates for how a movie should be made.",Seven Samurai
86,jdkraus,An epic that dwarfs most movies,10,2 February 2007,"I've heard much praise of the Seven Samurai for a long time. After seeing a couple of oriental action films like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; I decided to see this movie. I have come late in seeing it, back in 2004, (the 50 year anniversary), and I have to say that I have never been consumed by such a movie in a very long time.It is a straightforward film that reveals an unknown tale about a group of farmers who had been ravaged by bandits. Wondering what to do, they call upon their elder, who tells them to hire samurai warriors to defend them from the vicious bandits. This is one of those few movies that tells a whole tale from start to finish without any delays or plot holes. It is all understandable and easy to grasp. The three and half hour film flew by with no drags or any sign of boredom. I was engulfed by it.Not only was its storytelling great, but the cast was amazing. Every single cast member gave not only believable, but also moving performances, particularly by Tishorio Mifune, who played the hot-headed Kikuchiyo. Each character can be either loved or hated, there is no ""wooden"" acting in this film.The action sequences alone, in its time, and by today's standards are fantastic, both intense and engulfing simultaneously; well captured by Akira Kurosawa (whom since I've become a fan of). This may have been a cheaply done film, but it delivers the four things that a film needs to carry out: story, characters, film-making quality, and a flowing pace. it's guaranteed that this movie delivers it all! every movie that is either an oriental action flick, or a modern-day epic, must be compared to the Seven Samurai!-Since then, I have not seen one movie better than this film; it is among my top five favorites!",Seven Samurai
87,tomimt,Well balanced story with great direction,9,24 November 2005,"It might be silly to write another review of this great film, but what can one do? It's so darn impressive film.Seven Samurai tells a story of a small village, which is in the firm grip of a band of brigands, who steal their harvest and rape their women. The villagers are fed up and they head out to big city to hire a samurai to protect them. They soon hire Kambei (Takashi Shimura), who helps the villagers to hire six more samurais. Soon the band of seven head to the village and they begin to plan their defence.The movie is long, over three hours, but interestingly enough there are no unnecessary scenes in it. Kurosawa takes his time to tell the story just the way he want's to tell it. There actually isn't much of action in the film, when you think about it: action is part of the story, but only in a narrative sense. There is no unnecessary violence.I could recommend this film to everyone, but I've found myself, that you need to acquire a taste towards Japanese acting, as it often is more theatrical than in western movies (thought before 70's it often was very theatrical in all movies, not just Japanese ones.). But after you've done that, there's nothing to stop you enjoying about this film.",Seven Samurai
88,mahmus,There are few films as good as Seven Samurai.,10,28 June 2020,"This three and a half hour long movie feels both epic and small in scale, and it's soo good that despite it's very long runtime, it feels like a two hour long movie.Akira Kurosawa brings to life a cast of characters that you immidiately get attached to, especially Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune in probably his best role) who is by far one of my favorite movie characters of all time.This movie is something else. I love it so much.",Seven Samurai
89,Peach-2,Perfect.,10,21 February 1999,"This is simply one of the most perfect films I have ever sat down to watch. This is an epic of great scale and the cinematography is awesome. The acting is dead on and even the portrayl of the peasant villagers is graphic and perfect. Akira Kurosawa is simply one of the greatest directors and autuer film-makers that has ever lived. Kurosawa's film's hit you on a level you wouldn't expect and they take you for a ride that is unforgettable. This film has great atmosphere and you get to see the absolutely astounding Toshiro Mifune, simply the greatest Japanese actor of all time. Do yourself a favor and take a rainy afternoon and sit down to watch one of the most important films in cinema history.",Seven Samurai
90,dr_foreman,the realistic approach,10,22 January 2004,"I always want to review more classic movies on this web site, then I get all choked up.  What can I say?  It's fab!  Yeah, let it stand at that.  This is one fab movie.  I will add that the film takes a far more realistic approach than the entertaining, but inferior, remake - ""The Magnificent Seven.""  The Hollywood version makes it seem like fun to fight bandits, whereas here everyone - including the samurai - is truly terrified.  American movies are stylized in a way that many foreign films are not.  Some reviewers here have criticized the hysterical acting in ""Seven Samurai,"" but it's in fact far more true-to-life than the super-cool performances given by so many American stars.  If bandits were raiding your town, you'd freak out, too.",Seven Samurai
91,LoneWolfAndCub,This is a masterpiece in all sense of the word,10,15 July 2006,"Shichinin no samurai (Seven Samurai) is probably Akira Kurosawa's most loved movie. Shichinin no samurai is also my first Akira Kurosawa movie. After hearing so much about it I went out and rented the original full length version. Not once did I get bored. Although it takes 30 minutes to be introduced the first samurai, it's not boring. The fighting doesn't even happen until near the end of the movie. But not once was I bored.A village is being terrorised by a group of bandits. A villager overhears when the bandits will attack next. So three of the villagers go out in search of a samurai that will help protect them. This samurai feels pity for them and answers their call. He gathers another six samurai to help defend the village and train the villagers.This movie helped inspire an entire genre, the Western. Where do you think The Magnificent Seven came from?? Akira Kurosawa is a brilliant storyteller. This story unfolds beautifully and at a steady pace. The characters are all developed so that we care for them all. This movie a bit of everything. It has bits of humour, it has drama and it has plenty of action. The battle scenes are engaging and at times suspenseful. This movie is recommended for everyone, as it is a brilliant piece of cinema.5/5.",Seven Samurai
92,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: not too arty to enjoy,6,30 March 2002,"Let's get something straight: I'm an action movie guy. I like it when stuff blows up, and I don't have much tolerance for arty films or drama. Primarily, I don't have the refinement or the film school training to enjoy one aspect of the film (music score, costuming) when the rest of the movie is awful.So, like most people, I avoid the classics because most classics are B-A-D.But being an action movie buff, I checked out the Seven Samurai and it was pretty good. It was accessible to me, and while I can't at all agree that it's the best action movie of all time (a lot of stuff has blown up in the 50 years since this film came out), it was worth the risk.Who should see this film:-- Drama / arty types who need to flesh out their ""seen it"" credentials-- Action movie types who have nothing better to do on a rainy day. It will take a little willpower to get through, sort of like getting through those cheesy cop buddy flicks from the 1980s, but you can do that, right?I'll give ""The Seven Samurai"" a 5 out of 10.",Seven Samurai
93,haildevilman,Best non-English film ever!!!,10,6 January 2006,"I had the pleasure to see this film in America sub-titled and in a Japanese theater in it's original uncut version. This movie gets better every time.The action scenes are better than anything out there today and Kurosawa-san didn't have CGI to abuse.It was incredible seeing this mismatched group of men band together to risk their lives for people they didn't really respect. Great character build-up, brilliant action, superb tension, and even some flashes of comedy. And it's one of the DEEPEST action films that ever existed.It shows the duty the samurai dedicates himself to. That whether he likes it or not, there are some things he just MUST do.3&1/2 hours long but it seemed like 1&1/2. How many films can honestly say that today? Never looked at my watch once.",Seven Samurai
94,braddugg,The greatest Japanese film I have ever seen.,10,8 September 2014,"The greatest Japanese film I have ever seen.Firstly, I must admit that I have seen very few Japanese films. But I must admit that in grandeur and magnanimity, very few will match this film. Akira Kurosawa the master director made this magnum opus which I believe set a precedent in terms of various themes. Recruiting men for a purpose. A recruit romancing a local woman. A team taking up a task and accomplishing successfully with few sacrifices. These are just a few to name. This I believe is a film that has major influences from the far east to the far far west. Though made in Japan, there was a film called ""Magnificent Seven"" which was the remake of this film. That film was setup in the far far west where the Samurai were replaced by gunslingers. After watching this film, I can clearly understand what influences Kurosawa had on the likes of the film makers of later years from Steven Spielberg to Francis Ford Coppola to many Indian film makers.The themes in this film are subliminal to the extent of conflict. The conflict is even greater and is perhaps one of the earliest conflicts that spans for more than an hour. The whole fight between bandits and the villagers lasts for as many minutes as you can see. Yet, there are many things that happen in that and is almost made a war-like situation. I really doubt even in war movies, real war was shown for this long and with such intensity. The passion shown by Kurosawa is surely unmatched. In terms of set-design, casting of actors, choreography of the conflict, the cinematography with so many cameras and the finesse in editing that shows each frame beautifully. He is one of the few Asian directors who had that zeal and had that invested their whole lives in film making. Too much to learn from the first watching of this film and I am sure, I will revisit this film time and again to understand the composition of frames and many many things. From the beginning to the end this film is high on drama and has less comic content, except for the maverick Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo), but the high volume drama almost left me breathless and kept me engaged all the way.The writing is immaculate and the detailing is something that has inspired many film makers and will continue to do so. A 5/5 for one of the greatest films ever made.",Seven Samurai
95,PIST-OFF,Akira Kurosawa is awesome.,9,21 May 1999,The Seven Samurai is one of the best movies to come out of Asia ever. This well directed grandfather of Samurai movies is one of the most influential films of all time. Without the Seven Samurai there is no Magnificent Seven. Without the Magnificent Seven there is no Dirty Dozen. Without the Dirty Dozen there is no Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger. This movie is only slighty undone by it's length. And for those who can't tolerate either black and white movies or subtitles this could be rough. Great acting on the part of the all actors and one of the best screenplays in film history. Akira Kurosawa is truly a master of his art.,Seven Samurai
96,dragokin,a lot of excess footage in this one,3,5 May 2013,"I liked Seven Samurai better than Rashomon (1950) by the same author, probably because it has a plot. The approach is similar, though, leading to more than a third of the movie being excess footage. A two-hour director's cut would most likely had been a watchable piece of cinema, but we'll never be able to verify my claim.The question remains why is this one of the best movies by one of the best directors of all times, apart from a lot people telling you so. Decades of repeating led this mantra to becoming an unquestionable truth, but i'd like to point out that critics might be wrong, after all.One of the more recent examples is Sofia Coppola's Somewhere (2010). You watch it and wonder why the accolades... but i guess the critics always need something to talk about, even when it puts some of the viewers to sleep.",Seven Samurai
97,StanleyStrangelove,one of the greatest films ever made,10,3 September 2005,Considered one of the greatest films ever made The Seven Samurai is Akira Kurasawa's 16th century samurai epic. Shimada (Takashi Shimura) is an experienced samurai who is approached by a group of peasant farmers and asked to protect them from bandits who continue to attack and steal their food. Shimada is honorable and sees their need and he also needs to know where his next meal will come from so he agrees. He knows he can't go up against the bandits alone so he recruits five real samurai to help him. Crazy Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune) insists on tagging along even though he doesn't seem to be a real samurai. Shimada and his group of warriors train the villagers in the art of self defense and they are housed and fed. The film ends with an astounding battle when the village is attacked by the horde of bandits. The Seven Samurai is a long movie with subtitles and needs to be seen multiple times to get the most out of it. It's not an easy movie but it's an unforgettably moving experience. The American western version was The Magnificent Seven.,Seven Samurai
98,Java_Joe,An absolute classic.,9,8 May 2019,"Kurosawa's magnum opus ""Shichinin no Samurai"" better known as ""Seven Samurai"" is a classic for all times. This should be required viewing for anybody who appreciates cinema as well as anybody who loves action movies. It was so revolutionary, popular and powerful that they made an English language version which has also become a classic in it's own right known as ""The Magnificent Seven"". And that's the Yul Brenner version, not necessarily the one that came out a couple years ago.The story itself deals with a village being targeted by bandits and the inhabitants hiring mercenaries in the form of the seven samurai to help defend them. Each one of the samurai has an arc. Each one has his reason for being there. And each one adds to the story. There are no superfluous characters here. Every one plays their role. The cinematography is gorgeous. Each shot is composed. This is a work of love done by the director and it shows. They just don't make movies like this anymore.All the tropes are there. From the scenes where the characters are introduced and show us why they're the ones to be chosen. They run the gamut from the old and wise elder to the young and brash hothead and everybody in between. There are conflicts within the group and in many ways the bandits take a backseat to what the samurai themselves are going through. In a sense the bandits only serve to give the samurai a reason to be there and for us to see them on screen.This is a highly recommended movie especially to those that have only seen ""The Magnificent Seven"". Without this movie, that one would never have been made.",Seven Samurai

100,CinematicInceptions,"A blueprint for greatness, but not astounding in itself.",7,19 July 2015,"People have described this movie as the one that changed all movies after it, or some variation of that. Since this is basically the oldest movie I've seen, I'm not sure I can agree with that, but you can somehow sense that it's ahead of its time. That said, it is also a film that can be prone to hype influence, where people feel like they should like the movie because it's considered a classic and they feel like there's something groundbreaking and spectacular about it that they're missing. I'll admit that I was a little disappointed in how Seven Samurai delivered on its hype, but after taking a step back I think I figured out why it's so highly regarded. It provided a framework for later movies in it's story and characters, and I think that's why it felt a little disappointing. The movie feels like it missed out on its potential because it has all the marks of a great film, but doesn't quite pull it off because as the model it doesn't have anything to model off of. The high ratings are kind of interesting because I would expect a movie like this that influences later greater works to be disregarded, but thankfully it isn't.The basic plot is simple enough and has lots of potential. Forty bandits try to raid a vulnerable farming village. The villagers turn to a local samurai, Kambei, who searches for six other samurai to help defend the villagers. I found the idea of having to recruiting samurai that would only fight for the sake of fighting interesting. The first hour (in the three hour version at least) consists of Kambei recruiting the other samurai, most notably his new apprentice Katsushiro, and the drunken pseudo samurai Kikuchiyo. The second hour involves some exposition of the samurai and preparations for the inevitable bandit attacks. Once everything is in place, the bandits and samurai have a number of skirmishes. There is an internal subplot with Katsushiro courting Shino against her father's wishes. The samurai end up having to worry about the villagers they are serving as much as the bandits they are fighting. The villagers fear for their safety and general livelihood, which they feel is threatened by the presence of the samurai.The three main protagonists are Kambei, Katsushiro, and Kikuchiyo. Kambei has relatively little personality and serves as the sage and leader of the samurai. Katsushiro asserts himself as Kambei's apprentice and constantly tries to prove to himself that he is worthy of his samurai title. Kikuchiyo has some depth but is mostly a comic relief character that sets himself apart by going his own eccentric way as the other samurai collaborate. The other characters consist of the lesser samurai and the more prominent farmers. The four main farmers are Mosuke, Manzo, Yohei, and Katsushiro's love interest Shino. Shino and her father are the only two of these that have any kind of depth, whereas the other two are just on screen a lot without being important in any scene. The other samurai are developed a little, probably not as much as they should have in this long of a movie. Heihachi has a slight fear of battle, Gorobei is the most cheerful of the samurai and ends up being a kind of second to Kambei, Kyuzo is the master swordsman, and Rikichi, I think, is the one who has a bandit wife.It's an old movie so there isn't any stunning action or anything like that. Same goes for the cinematography, camera-work, and other technical areas. I would recommend that you watch it if only to put a few more opinions out there. It's probably not going to be your favorite movie, especially since it drags at times and is in black and white. There's a little Japanese culture involved, so there might be a couple of things that don't make sense. There is a free 3 hour version on youtube, which is the one I watched, but be warned that the audio is about 20-30 seconds behind the visual. Still, that's probably your best option if you're hesitant to spend money on it. So is it over-hyped and overrated? Maybe, but it's still worth a try. Overall Rating: 7.3/10.",Seven Samurai
101,MattBrady099,Seven Samurai - Movie Review,10,30 April 2016,"Let me ask you a quick question: When you're watching a movie, what's the first thing you notice or look for? Acting? Lighting? Color? Shots? Shapes? All of these are just naming a few great elements of what makes a movie so special, as there's plenty more out there that I probably left out, but those are mostly the key ones that some film makers choice when making a movie. But when I watch a movie, the first thing I look for is hidden quality, storytelling by the characters movements, acting, lighting, and the use of silence to add emotion to a scene. And yes, this movie absolutely has all of those things I love in movies and much more. I think I died and went to movie heaven. Sometimes when I talk about a beloved movie that many film makers and critics out there consider a ""masterpiece"", I think it's very important for me to talk about the actual film making and what makes it so great, as this gives a better thought of what I see when I watched the movie. I mean, it's much better than saying what you like or didn't about a film without talking about the film making itself. Oh and this also my first Akira Kurosawa movie I've watched and reviewed, so there's that. I've heard nothing but amazing things about Kurosawa movies and how every famous director has put him up there as the best director that has ever lived, and I totally understand why, because Akira Kurosawa is one of the most stylish, influential, and one of the most tremendous film maker that has ever lived. From start till finish, I was completely in awed from what I was watching and it's still fresh in my mind as I'm writing this.For Kurosawa's film career, he has made over 30 films and a few TV movies, but ""Seven Samurai"" seems to be the one movie that everyone knows about (even if there haven't seen it). And I understand why, as everything with the camera work, editing transitions, and the use of mother nature as an emotional trigger for the audience, is everything that an audience can emotional relate to and draw their eye to. Because the choices of weather used in scenes that basically sums up what kind of mood a character or a scene itself is feeling. Wind, sunshine, and rain, really do add a lot to the scene, as you can tell what you're suppose to be feeling. Akira Kurosawa was quite famous for how he wanted to get the weather perfect in his scenes. Over a course of a year, he shot this movie for 148 days and it was often him waiting for the weather for the next scene. And that's not all, Kurosawa told his actors to chose a gesture for their character and stick with it. That way, we know exactly what kind person their are and how they're feeling. It's bold film making like this is what made Akira Kurosawa a massive influence to cinema today. Another thing I loved about this movie is the characters, as I actually did care for them and their struggle. I sometimes find it very hard to have a full emotional attachment to characters in movies, but here, it amazes me how I know so much from the characters just by their movements that really dose say a lot without them saying anything. All the praise has to go to the actors for this, as it was them who had to deliver and they absolutely do. I'm unaware with all of these actors, but then again, I don't watch that much black and white Japans movies these days. All of the cast were all superb in their roles and most have been a very different cult challenge to pull off, because it's not easy as it looks, but all of them nailed it. The camera work in this movie is so impressive, so unique, and freaking glorious. The way the camera moves tells a story of itself that doesn't require any character to spill out the story or what's going on. I could show any scenes from this movie to someone who hasn't see the movie themselves and even they will have a full grasp on whats going or how someone is feeling without knowing nothing about the movie itself. That's how brilliant this movie. Overall: Seven Samurai is a epic masterpiece with flawless imagery and a unique style of violence and battles. I can not wait to see Kurosawa other movies, as I have a feeling I'm going to love them.",Seven Samurai
102,SkullScreamerReturns,It's pretty good overall but how can people enjoy movies this long?,7,2 April 2020,"I just hate when movies are too long. Even if it's a very good movie. It's like having your favorite food but forced to eat so much that you start to puke. How can you give a good rating for an experience like that? If you think 3 hours is a short time, see my point of view: Imagine if somebody made a movie that lasts 100 hours. Try to watch that without falling asleep. You just couldn't do it. Well, over 3 hours feels a bit like that to me. It's like adding more beverage to a cup that is already full. The rest is going to spill to the table and that's not fun anymore.The first half stayed very interesting but I started to lose my attention during the second half. It's like when you're waiting for a concert or something but the band is two hours late. When they finally come to stage you are already tired and just want to go home. The ending of this movie felt a bit like that. When the long awaited final battle was happening my thoughts weren't following the movie anymore.There are a lot of interesting characters, the story is excellent, and everything looks good visually. It's just too long, that's all.It's a pretty good film, and also so famous that you want to see it just to know what all the fuss is about. So I recommend it to everybody.

103,lagudafuad,Wonderful directing,6,1 October 2012,"Nothing beats a well thought of plan to ward off bandits. Samurai movies always show cases the best of swordsmanship, but this movie shows that a well thought strategic plan is better than a battalion of armed soldiers.This Japanese adventure drama film was co-written and directed by Akira Kurosawa.The film takes place in 1587 and it follows the story of a village of farmers that were constantly being raided by bandits who steal their crops during the time of harvest.The villagers then decided to go source for help, they hired seven masterless samurai (ronin) to come help defend their village.The movie is long, and it takes its time to build up to the defence of the city, but if you can manage to keep awake till then, what you will notice is mastery in camera footage, the cinematography is flawless, the editing can use a bit of touch up here and there, but the cinematography was just exceptional. My favourite shooting will be in the time when the rain was coming down and you will see how Akira managed to make the best of camera tricks to pass the message of a messy battle.The movie though made in 1954, has some wonderful display of acting, well i would advise if you have 3 hours to spear get the DVD, just try to stay awake till the last 40mins it is worth it.",Seven Samurai

105,avik-basu1889,Arguably the most influential action film of all time !!!,8,20 April 2015,"Seven Samurai is one of the most widely acclaimed films of all time. This film comes up time and again on numerous great films lists of critics as well as fans. Seven Samurai has had a monumental impact in the action film genre, it was a film way ahead of its time and it has since been remade (The Magnificent Seven) and the concept of a group of heroes coming together to fight against the common enemy has also subsequently been replicated time and again.Seven Samurai might bluntly be an action film, but the underlying themes of the film I believe are poverty and class distinction. The poverty of the poor farmers is an indictment of how people can reach rock bottom and how helpless the poor can be under the reigns of toothless rulers and governments. They are forced to take a stand. This film also talks about class distinction in society. The farmers and the samurai belong to different classes of society and although they are forced to fight together, there are some farmers who just can't accept this merger. Kurosawa also makes a touching statement about how the samurai were slowly being sidelined in society and how they were gradually losing importance after the civil wars in Japan. Kurosawa through a monologue actually conveys that the animosity between the farmers and the samurai existed due to the faults of both parties thus showing how no one party can be blamed for it. The ending to the film has a touch of melancholy to it, due to the fact, that even after all the effort, the end result didn't thematically achieve what it was supposed to.Technically, the film is a masterpiece. I just couldn't believe the quality of the action scenes from a film made in 1954. The set pieces, the camera movements, the choreography of the fighting seemed so brutally convincing and realistic. These sequences are fascinatingly directed. There are some reservations that I have for this film. They are regarding the acting. The acting at times is too over the top by Mifune and some others. The film is also not as layered and deep thematically as Kurosawa's other efforts as far as I am concerned. The cinematography is breathtaking with absolutely haunting stills and picturesque shots. I still think that Seven Samurai is one of the most important films of all time in the course of the evolution of action films and cinema as a whole from a technical standpoint. But thematically I like Rashomon, High & Low and Ikiru more,",Seven Samurai
106,peefyn,"A fantastic movie, that has not aged that well in all regards",7,8 October 2016,"I love the acting in this movie. Mostly it's really good. Even minor characters feel very much like a part of the universe they're in, almost as if Kurosawa just found a village and started shooting. At the same time, and this might be due to difference in cultures, all of the characters feel super real, because everyone is shouting all the time, they're always running, and they usually react as a group, moving together like it was all choreographed.It's also quite extraordinary how thorough this movie is leading you through the events in what is essentially a battlefield. It goes as far as having the characters literally ticking check boxes for each death. It shows you the plans before the action starts, and then have the characters actions show you how the plans are progressing. It's an impressive feat, considering it all feels natural. But still, had it been made today, I am sure the filmmaker would not have dared to risk boring the audience with the same attention being given to details. And while it is interesting to many to have the battle shown this way, I am sure a modern audience would prefer to just have it all happen, perhaps opting for montages instead. It's hard to say one is the better option over the other, but the way Kurosawa did it is not bad. It might just not be what modern audiences would prefer.Another odd bit, that have not aged that well, is that pretty much every comedic moment (in which the characters are laughing), it's almost always at the expense of someone. They're laughing at people in a way that today would probably not be that accepted.",Seven Samurai
107,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,3 May 2005,"Kurosawa's most famous film, and arguably the most famous film ever to come out of Japan over 50 years after its release. Endlessly influential, often touted as the first action movie, and full of rich cinematography, brilliantly constructed set-pieces, humour, sorrow, and some timeless characters portrayed by excellent performances. The Seven Samurai is still seen today by fans and critics alike as one of the best films ever made, almost flawless in every department and still as appealing and relevant as it was 5 decades ago.The film begins by telling us that Japan over 400 years ago was a place of fighting and poverty, with Samurai and bandits wandering the countryside, some with honour, some stealing from the poor. We meet a group of 40 bandits who travel from village to village through the year ransacking and taking whatever they can find. In the past they have murdered farmers, raped their wives and daughters, and taken their livelihood. The decide to raid one village once it is time for the farmers to harvest. A few villagers over-hear this and tell everyone else so they can prepare. Some believe they should fight, some say they should plead with the bandits, others say they should just give in as always or they will be killed. Eventually their Patriarch Gisaku says they should go and hire some help, Samurai who will help them in exchange for food. This seems like an outrageous plan as Samurai are proud, but a small group of farmers led by Rikichi leave with some food to find such Samurai in the hope that their village will be saved, the alternative being worse. They struggle at first and we see how there is no pity for them, that most people are too busy with their own affairs. Just as they give up hope they witness Kambei, a Samurai performing a selfless deed. They follow him and ask for help. Joining Kambei is a young apprentice Samurai Katsushiro who also saw Kambei's deed, and following them is a fiery man who claims to be a samurai-Kikuchiyo. Kambei listens to them and eventually agrees, believing they will need a total of seven Samurai. He and Katsushiro make two, and they begin to look for and test others. Kambei's old friend Schichiroji who he believed was dead arrives making 3. A woodcutting, quirky Samurai called Heihachi joins as well as masterful swordsman Kyuzo making 5, and a man nicknamed strongman makes 6. They leave for the village, followed by Kikuchiyo who wants to be part of their group even though no-one believes he is a Samurai. He proves himself and makes 7 when the villagers do not come to welcome their rescuers. We see how the Samurai and farmers as two different kinds of people mix, and we see mistrust and fear. Many emotions come out adding a depth so rarely seen in action films, there is a love story between Katsushiro and Shino, many twists, prejudices and hidden truths. As the bandits approach, the farmers are trained and a plan is made, but there will be many casualties.As so many books have been written on this film alone I can only offer a summary. Each actor is excellent, with Mifune standing out. Shimura, Miyaguchi, Tsuchiya, and Kimura all give emotive performances and when a character dies or feels sorrow we genuinely grieve with or for them. There is so much going on and so many story lines that we are completely pulled into the lives of each character. Kurosawa's direction cannot be faulted, and although it is slow at times and the search for Samurai takes up much of the film, we are captivated throughout. The action scenes, groundbreaking for their time still manage to create awe today simply because they are filmed so beautifully. This is an immortal story of winners and losers, of truth and honour, of love in all its guises, and of overcoming personal prejudice which will stay in the mind forever.10 out of 10",Seven Samurai

110,Marc_Israel_365,Beyond the cine-history...,8,14 January 2018,"Many film historians point towards Seven samurai as the genesis of the great western and inspiration of countess story line and plot reinventions. That's great, but watching other ""firsts"", such as Citizen Kane, have failed to create that sense of disbelief that allows one to lose themselves in the experience. Not so with Akira Kurasawa's Seven Samurai.Each character has their own personality allowing the details of their emotions infiltrate the experience. This is not a WWII soldier story when everyone and then some die for their country,. This is not war time... or is it? That's the point of teh film that there is no end to transgressions against humanity and doing the right thing is both honorable and hard. I see some overplayed parts by the villagers and wonder if the Japanese audiences thought them more funny or silly, or simply disposed of them as the weak link of the movie, as I did. That is in contrast to the faceless enemy of the bandits, portrayed as poachers with swords... Can you imagine working so hard for so little and having it stolen without protection? You can feel for these farmers as if they were somewhere out in the American West, one of our own.... yes, the story is quite sympathetic.But movie is about our crew of seven and their joining to defend a defenseless group by means of preparedness that is more military strategy than you would have expected. I loved this aspect of the film the best, but would have felt rushed if we didn't know our group and who they were there to protect.

In 16th century Japan, a murderous gang of 40 bandits threatens to go on a rampage of plundering and murder in a farming village. The menaced citizens hire seven professional soldiers, the samurai, who agree to fight off the invaders.The film has been rightfully celebrated by fans and critics worldwide for its humor, heroism and humanity. ""The Seven Samurai"" was the obvious inspiration for the later Hollywood Western ""The Magnificent Seven"", copying the essence of it's predecessor in many aspects.The original Japanese version with English subtitles may appeal more than the dub version.",Seven Samurai
112,OttoVonB,Solid Gold,10,8 January 2003,"I discovered 16 of Kurosawa's best known films before returning to the one which is commonly thought of as his masterpiece. Seven Samurai is unlike any other grand classic ever produced. It's basic plot can be summed up in a single easy sentence, yet its refinement and execution rival any movie you've ever seen. The premise: in chaotic 16th century Japan, as marauders threaten raid villages, one village hires samurai to defend it from a group of bandits. Yet Kurosawa (also co-writer) developed these characters in a way unheard of for what might pass as an epic action film. To its astonishing credit, through all of its 207 minutes running time, Seven Samurai never falters or bores. And if the script is a marvel in itself, the acting and production design than derive from it are nothing short of superlative. It is said that Kurosawa forced the villagers (from supporting role to mere extra) to live together as a community during production and be their characters, each and every one of which he had drawn out specifically. This unusual technique gave Seven Samurai a feel of authenticity unparalleled in film history.The samurai themselves are so richly given life to in the screenplay that little more would have been needed to make them memorable characters, yet the main cast pay off at every turn, and though every one of the seven main actors give in perfect performances (never as I had feared before watching it do you confuse them, even in the chaotic battle scenes), two immortal roles have a particularly resounding effect: Takashi Shimura (Kambei Shimada), who plays the leader of the ragged band of samurai, gives his sage and venerable warrior a god-like intensity that makes the magnetic charisma of his character unquestionable. One of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making. Stealing the show however, albeit by a very thin margin, is longtime Kurosawa favorite coworker Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) as the rogue seventh, the black sheep of the herd, giving the bravura ultimate performance of a lifetime paved throughout with great roles. The story follows them and the villagers, equally nuanced and developed, through their encounter, training, eventual bonding and the big inevitable fight for survival. Unlike subsequent very successful remakes (i.e. Magnificent Seven), seven Samurai transcended excellency by having many layers (nothing or no one is white or black: everything exists in shades of gray) and thus being very real and human. Even without the menace, its interpersonal dynamics would have made it perfect human drama, subtle, balancing comedy, intensity, realism, drama and a deep philosophy with astonishing ease, yet the menace does materialize and thus Seven Samurai unleashes its violence in a series of action scenes crafted with such vision and ingenuity as has ever reached an action film (the frenetic battle scenes at the end rather evoke Saving Private Ryan in their relentlessness).In the end, what made this into solid gold was, at the core, Akira Kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Red Beard, Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, Ran), would never top this one. Throughout his life, Kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. If so, Seven Samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. One of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite.",Seven Samurai
113,zeekwunlau,"Protect the village, defend the homeland",9,18 April 2020,"The whole film revolves around the story of the peasant who discovered the thief and invaded the village, then went to the city to seek the help of the samurai, and the villagers and the samurai jointly fought against the enemy. But the ins and outs are very detailed. Not only can you see the peasant suffering level, this is common to all countries during the war, but it is more than that. You can also see the cowardice of the peasants when the samurai comes to the village and the villagers. The cunning, selfish side. They have looked down on themselves from their bones and regarded themselves as particularly humble. As you fight against the warriors together, you can also see their honesty and courage. This is the authenticity of this movie. Each warrior has his own personality. As a commander, the reconnaissance guards already know how to lay out defenses based on the map. Kikuyo, as an orphan from a farming household, seemed crazy and arrogant, but he actually understood the inferiority of the peasants. Only when he heard the siren did everyone flee panic and ask for the help of the samurai. Equipped with humiliation, and hiding his own property, selfishness, only focusing on his house, not fighting to protect others, these are his wild and unruly way of life. There is also the optimistic and open-minded Pachiba, and the brave and warlike martial arts and high-strength Kuzo.In the end, the mountain thief was defeated, and the village was preserved with the joy and laughter of the peasants, and the desolation of the remaining three warriors in front of the grave of the warrior on the hilltop ended. The peasants seemed to forget that the four brave warriors sacrificed for them The only thing in front of me is the pleasure of receiving wheat, just like the separation of the two classes, it is none of our business. No wonder the reconnaissance guards finally said that we had defeated the battle again, and the peasants won the last victory.A film shows the life of the peasant class and the warrior class during the war, which is too comprehensive, just like a personal resume.",Seven Samurai

116,GeorgeRoots,The Quintessential Samurai Classic.,9,29 January 2015,"Akira Kurosawa's first Samurai film needs no introduction. It is happily perched high on any prestigious film lists and its influence on story, characters and battle sequences continues to be never ending. In terms of story it cannot be more simple, a village of poor people are under the threat of looming bandits who plan to pillage everything within the next few days. Their only hope is dependent on the charitable services of fleeting Samurai, in hopes that they will accept rice as payment. Eventually through thick and thin an experienced Ronin (Takashi Shimura) aids the villagers plea and assembles five other Samurai, including a mischievous jester (Toshiro Mifune) who eventually proves his worth.Originally known as ""Six Samurai"", Kurosawa and the screenwriters knew they needed another character more off the wall. Enter the iconic Toshiro Mifune, in his 7th appearance among the 16 productions he and Kurosawa shared. Largely improvised, his hapless and temperamental behaviour definitely stands out as the star of the show. The most expensive production at the time, the budget went overboard leading Toho Productions to shut it down twice. Kurosawa remained ever calm, convincing Toho to have faith and let him finish the picture. Though its length hinders the pacing ever slightly, ""Seven Samurai"" is gold in terms of big classic adventure drama. That wonderful Samurai march theme happily plays during innate and climactic scenes, and as always the weather plays a vital role in all of Kurosawa's movies, none more so than here in it's fantastic finale (Where Mifune would comment he'd never felt so cold in his life).Final Verdict: The longest of Kurosawa's filmography, and definitely one of the very best. It's 60 years old, shot and told beautifully and remains an iconic piece of Japanese Cinema. 9/10.",Seven Samurai
117,ilpohirvonen,A Beautiful Fresco of Humanity,10,27 February 2011,"""There are people who criticize my work and say it is not realistic. But I feel that merely copying the outward appearance of the world would not result in anything real -- that is only copying. I think that to find what is real one must look very closely at one's world, to search for those things that contribute to this reality which one feels under the surface. The novels of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Turgenev show us what these things are. To be an artist means to search for, find, and look at these things; to be an artist means never to avert one's eyes."" (Akira Kurosawa)Writing about Kurosawa has always been a challenge for me. He's one of the greatest cinematic Gods, and is the guru of Japanese film for many of us. How can one describe his 'magnum opus', the greatest of all and the first actual samurai-picture. Seven Samurai is a grand, epic fresco about life and death, victory and defeat, glory and the loss of it; one can see that Kurosawa was infatuated by the very same themes, the greatest playwright of all, William Shakespeare was. Dealing with his own culture's taboos characterized Kurosawa's entire work but he drilled down deeper, neglecting historical or cultural limitations. He drilled down to pure emotion, to humanity and the depth of it.In the early 1950's Japanese films came to Europe for the first time, and its masters were instantly renowned for their unique style. French critic and film theorist, Andre Bazin wrote that the appreciation towards these films might just be first-time flush and fascination for exotic culture. But after he had seen about twenty Japanese films, he was sure it wasn't just that. There was something more. In 1954, when Akira Kurosawa had just finished his most ambitious film, European audiences and critics were thrilled once again. This was something completely new and, different from everything they had admired about Japanese cinema, for which we can give the credit to Mizoguchi's lyricism. Akira Kurosawa made a Japanese western; the very first samurai-film. It had the same elements American westerns did, and Seven Samurai can easily be compared with the finest films by John Ford.'Samurai' comes from the word; 'to serve', and samurais were servants. They were a class of their own in feudal Japan, and not until the end of the 17th century was the class removed. Even that samurais were servants they were part of the upper-class; they were used, not only to serve but, also to smash small peasant revolts. Samurais even had the right to kill a man who acted disrespectfully towards a representative of the samurai-class. Sometimes, due to boredom and poverty, samurais had to take smaller jobs without gaining much money, and this is exactly what happens in Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. But still the samurais do their job out of solidarity, with heart and talent.A group of bandits terrorize a small farmers' village due to which the village hires seven samurais to protect them. Through hard work and precise strategies the samurais, together with the peasants, overthrow the forty bandits and villagers can grow rice in peace once again. The storyline resembles various westerns, for instance John Ford's Stagecoach (1939), but there is something more in Seven Samurai. The beauty of the simple plot has something that great novels by Dostoevsky have. This Japanese fresco is wider, more complex and manifold. To this simple story Kurosawa has added depth and beauty through brilliant details which usually are the things that make the films by him so great. In the midst of the grand fighting sequences Kurosawa has placed scenes which offer several humanely interesting and understanding characteristics of life and human nature. He offers lyric flashes of the beauty of nature and love; a flowing river, crying men, a woman throwing herself into a burning house because she has lost her glory, and the sparking love between one samurai and a farmer's girl. These kind of emotional scenes, Kurosawa often seals with rain. The cleansing, but also melancholy, rain.After the violent final sequence, where the samurais and the farmers have to kill the last 13 bandits, the film returns to its calm rhythm. Four of the samurais have died, and the last three look at the farmers planting rice. The samurais didn't win the war, they lost; they got their rice and were unemployed once again. Life won the war, and the fearful peace-loving farmers got the reward; not the warlike but helpful samurais.There is so much to say about this timeless masterpiece which is impossible to process in one thousand words. Seven Samurai is a beautiful film about humanity and the depth of it. It's a complex and life-enhancing fresco. A gorgeous tale of the human nature and solidarity. Just as John Ford, so did Kurosawa portray brave men but to him bravery wasn't all glory and fame; in Seven Samurai we see men crying, talking about emotions and what's on their minds. This was an unconventional theme for Japan and it proves how much more humane Seven Samurai is compared to western masterpieces. This should not be interpreted as an insult towards westerns or John Ford, not at all, he was one of Kurosawa's biggest influences -- and bravery was never a shallow or simple theme for Ford either. Kurosawa's social and political ideologies are not hard to see but overall the lyricism and beauty of the ending indicate that humanism is the greatest ideal of all for him. I feel that it is only fair to end this review the way it started, by quoting the master himself.""An action film can only be an action film. But how wonderful it is if it can also depict the human nature. It has been my dream ever since I was a co-director. For ten years I've wanted to deal with the ancient drama from this new perspective."" (Akira Kurosawa)",Seven Samurai
118,PeterRoeder,The most incredible display of macho power,9,16 June 2004,"No movie has ever had the dignity and power of this one. It is struggling with ""Space Oddesey 2001"" about being the most impressive movie ever made. Each scene is like a splendid painting. The characters are astonishing. At first I didn´t like the Mishune character but he gets stronger with each viewing. He shouldn´t be confused with the Yojimbo/Sanjuro character though in later Kurosawa samurai films. Mifune plays a kind of peasant samurai here who transcends his karma which is like The Dark Knight of 1980s Batman comics. The same goes for other scenes and characters. This movie has had a vast influence on other artworks. The ""leader"" samurai is very impressive in his leader role as well and also the master swordsman. As well as all the samurais. And the beautiful girl who is the young samurai´s love interest. The Buddhist philosophy of this movie is obvious. I cannot stress how much power and dignity this movie contains. Especially, male power, I guess. In that way, it is like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or something. However, the lessons to be learned by ""7 samurai"" are not to be missed.

119,bix171,A Masterpiece Both Epic And Intimate,10,16 March 2002,"Akira Kurosawa's magnificent film combines an insightful meditation on the strategies of war with an equally brilliant examination of what drives people in their struggles to survive. Kurosawa's beautiful black and white depictions of battle (including the stunning finale taking place in a rain storm) are offset by some very moving subplots involving forbidden young love and the thankless task of defending those unable to repay and unwilling to respect. For many people, Toshiro Mifune's rollicking extrovert Kikuchiyo is the most engaging character; but for me, Seiji Miyaguchi's quiet, committed Kyuzo is the film's center: he epitomizes the sacrifice and resolve that audiences gravitate to with admiration. Kurosawa works with passion and intensity but he's quite willing to stop for a moment to admire the natural beauty of the surroundings or to share a hearty laugh with the viewer. The film is always impressive--the wonder of it is that's impressive in ways both epic and intimate.",Seven Samurai
120,Eternality,"With characterization and plot developments established so excellently, the joy of watching it all unfold is pure cinematic ecstasy.",10,25 August 2010,"After more than half a century, Seven Samurai remains to be one of the greatest works of cinema. The man behind it is Akira Kurosawa, one of the greatest filmmakers ever. He is responsible for an unsurpassed body of work that has and still continues to inspire filmmakers young and old worldwide.Few would disagree that Seven Samurai represents the definitive film of the legendary Japanese director's luminous career. In a decade which is proud to establish some of the medium's most gifted practitioners including Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Satyajit Ray, and Andrzej Wajda, Kurosawa is arguably the most influential.Seven Samurai exists in many cuts. The most rewarding is the original uncut version that runs more than 200 minutes. Do not let the lengthy runtime put you off, because there is probably no other film as incredibly well-paced as Seven Samurai. It gains tremendous momentum, and is so thoroughly enjoyable from start to end that the intermission sequence halfway through feels like the film's only liability.Repeated viewings get only better, allowing us to further appreciate Kurosawa's technical prowess and artistic vision. The film's storyline is simple: A group of poor, helpless farmers hire samurai to protect their village from ruthless, marauding bandits who steal their rice.Seven Samurai is split into three major acts: First, the seven samurai are introduced. Each is given time to develop a personality. Ironically, the longest time is given to Toshiro Mifune's character, Kikuchiyo, who needs little development for his presence immediately lights up every scene he is in. He gives the film's most entertaining performance as an impulsive, wild, and occasional clownish peasant masquerading as a samurai.In contrast, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), the leader of the group, is honorable and caring, and is in my opinion the film's best-acted role. A young inexperienced samurai, a skillful samurai who is always practicing his craft, and three other samurai whose personalities are interchangeable make up the other quintet.The second act shows the integration of the samurai into the village of farmers who give them the cold shoulder by hiding in their shabby homes when they first arrive. After all, samurai are still fundamentally killers and their instinctive reactions are triggered by fear more than anything else. Kikuchiyo makes himself useful by breaking the ice between the two social classes in perhaps the film's most hilarious set-piece.Speaking of which, Kurosawa sprinkles the film with many scenes of humor (especially those involving the bumbling Kikuchiyo) that lightens the mood of the film, creating essential camaraderie amongst the characters. And in a subplot, Kurosawa explores tradition and social stigmatism when one of the samurai forbiddingly falls in love with a daughter of a farmer.The third act showcases Kurosawa at his skillful best: the climatic battle sequences. Filmed in adverse conditions that include heavy rain, mud and strong winds, these scenes are brilliantly edited through the rapid inter-cutting of chaotic ground shots of hooves of horses and limbs of humans (farmers, samurai, and bandits) as they scurry about to kill or avoid being killed, together with distinct eye-level shots of the events that are happening. In one magnificent scene, a swarm of bandits on horses rush down from a hilltop to the village below in an uninterrupted sequence that has long been accepted as Kurosawian.Never for a moment when watching Seven Samurai do we seem puzzled. Everything is laid out clearly by Kurosawa. Before the samurai meet the farmers, we already know most of their personalities. Before the battle cry is sounded, the samurai have already taken us on a tour of the village's key defence points and their tactical strategies while training the farmers to defend themselves.With characterization and plot developments established so excellently, the joy of watching it all unfold is pure cinematic ecstasy. The art direction and costume design are exemplary. Together with the incredible cinematography and haunting music, Kurosawa effectively transports us several centuries back.In my opinion, Kurosawa's most accomplished picture is Ran (1985), a fabulously told tale of literally Shakespearean proportions. However, Seven Samurai is arguably his most entertaining, a glorious triumph that is still the standard-bearer for bravura epic filmmaking. It represents not only a cultural turning point for Japanese cinema (its Western influences are obvious) but also an important milestone in the art of filmmaking. If there is ever a film to show to students of cinema how to write, direct, and edit a movie, this is it.SCORE: 10/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Seven Samurai

123,jose-cruz53,A very good action movie,10,20 September 2012,"Perhaps one of the most influential films of all time, Seven Samurai is also an excellent film. At over 3 hours long, it is also long and complex, with many different characters, each one developed as a complex and interesting individual.A story about a village in 16th Japan trying to survive and protect its possessions against the aggression of bandits. Based on past experience, the peasants decide to hire samurai to defend the village. Even though they were only able to pay the Samurai with rice. The first half of the film refers to the process of forming the group of samurai, when we gradually know each of the characters and by the middle of the film we are already well acquainted with each one of these characters.The second half of the film shows the detailed process by with the military knowledge of the samurai is used to prepare the village against the brutal siege executed by the bandits. The second half of the film is almost a documentary about a fictional battle rather than a character driven fiction.The film is generally excellent, given the technical limitations of filming in the early 1950′s Japan. However, it has several flaws: it is a bit formulaic, has a simple structure. The last half of the movie is basically: we killed 4 bandits in the last engagement, 23 to go, , now we killed another 7, 16 to go, . It gets a bit repetitive which reduces the tension. Also, it is plain ludicrous that a gang of bandits would fight to the death just to get some grain from a poor village. It breaks my suspense of disbelief.And yes, it suffers from the technical limitations of its day and place: Japan was a very poor country in 1954 and thus didn't have a large movie industry capable of producing movies to the same standard as Hollywood did. A black and white film, with poor resolution and sharpness, simply reduces the quality of the overall experience. Also, the soundtrack is not exactly inspiring. The rating I give does not show mercy to the technical limitations that Kurosawa had to face as I only care about the pleasure derived from experience from seeing the movie and not its importance as a benchmark and influence to other movies. It was a very good movie, but not among the best I have ever seem.Edit: Upon second viewing I would upgrade my score to 10/10 for this masterpiece.

127,revival05,One of the best movies I have ever seen.,10,5 July 2000,"Year after year I have lived with PULP FICTION and STAR WARS as favorite movies, without even knowing that there were some movies who aren't just movies. A perfect example is SHICHININ NO SAMURAI. Just the fact that the movie spins on for 3.5 hours and never ever bores is remarkable. Akira Kurosawa has made a movie that is simply one of a kind, and he didn't need any psychologic riddles or complex scenes (BERGMAN) to do it, he just did it. The story of human's right to live, human courage and war is hell no matter which time is maybe the most powerful ever, certainly one of my biggest movie-memories from now. The seven Samurais that the title means, actually have similarities to the seven dwarfs. There is a leader, the strong, the angry, the shy etc, etc... That was my first thought in this movie. This is also a movie with lots of genres all in one. Something that I love in a movie. It is intense all the way. At first it is a tragedy, everything seems hopeless, even more hopeless with the search of samurais in the city. Well then the movie proves that there is a light in every situation. A proof is when the bum gives Shimada a bowl of hot rice and sais ""go ahead and eat, they give you the finest they've got"" and he sais ""yes I hear you, don't shout"". He turns to the farmers and say ""I put value on your sacrifise"". There is a moment of movie magic, ladies and gentlemens. It seems brighter for every minute. The company finds five samurais and a little more suspect character (but the most poulair from the movie), Kikuchiyo, in an excellent performance by Mifune. Well, what can I say? The rest of the movie is a pleasure. The acting is flawless. There isn't one bad acting performance in this movie. That is very, very rare but I really mean it, I can't seem to find one flaw. Not in the editing either. The fight scene with Kyuzo and that cocky guy is a classic. Just look at it. ""What a waste"" I believe Shimada says during the attack. Well, what can I say. He's right, but it was one professional waste, I can tell you.This is simply a masterpiece in all ways. It is a masterpiece in drama, romance, adventure and action. Shimada's speeches are fantastic, every scene Kyuzo is in is nothing to describe with words nor Mifune's character Kikuchiyo. This is an experience like no other! The romance in this movie, might have had nothing to do with the story, but it's one of the most realistic I've ever seen. The adventure in this movie, for me, is the preparation of the bandits. That's my favorite part. I sense suspense there, am I alone with this feeling? The action scenes are amazing. Even more amazing when you realize that SHICHININ NO SAMURAI was made in 1954. This is simply a movie that I recommend to everybody! 10",Seven Samurai
128,mardalsfossen01,"Not as epic I thought it would be, but still good",7,3 January 2020,Don't expect any spectacular Samurai sword techniques being displayed. It's a black/white 3 hours long japanese movie with quite a few memorable characters and a lot of talking (at times funny) and battling. There's only two main settings - a village and a small town. Good for it's time and a japanese classic. Although I don't think they got the most out of it - There's still some parts making me come up with a better way to present it.,Seven Samurai
129,jamesjustice-92,Kurosawa's longest,9,6 May 2018,"Reviewing classics is like reviewing the invention of the wheel. The most important thing is that the invention has overgrown its inventor and has become much more than ""just another wheel"" or probably the beginning of something great.
Seven Samurai was my first movie from the filmography of this wonderful japanese director and I can say only one bad thing about - it's long. Unbearably long. Don't take this the wrong way, I like when the movie pushes boundaries of running time and shows you the greatest story that you enjoy watching every second. Gone with the wind. Ben-Hur. Lawrence of Arabia. Even the silent ones, Dr. Mabuse and Die Nibelungen (which both are over 4 hours) have got that something that glues you to your seat until the very end. It's the story. The story that doesn't allow you to leave for a second. Sadly it's not the case with Seven Samurai. Maybe because the story itself isn't that exciting and the plot is very simple so you can easily skip some scenes, delete an hour of running time and it will be perfect. A masterpiece. And again, don't take this the wrong way, this movie is a masterpiece. The characters (especially Kikuchiyo), music, cinematography, editing, locations; everything was superb. Except for the fact that you could easily fall asleep starting 35 min mark running time.
A must watch for true fans of cinema as an art.",Seven Samurai
130,antagonist117,"Rich with historical insights, and of course entertaining as well, this is essential viewing",10,14 March 2014,"What ""Seven Samurai"" offers is not a mere slice of life, but a panoramic painting of it as it may have once existed in medieval Japan. The screenplay depicts, in an entirely naturalistic and unforced way, the barriers of propriety and experience that seem to have separated classes, genders, and rural and urban societies in that milieu, as well as the mutual (and mutually resented) dependencies between these groups. Most impressively, the movie shows how readily people might transgress the widely recognized and rigorously enforced boundaries, and what the consequences of such transgressions could be. The script is sympathetic with its characters, whose ambitions are validated even when they prove irreconcilable with the truths of the world Kurosawa creates.One character, discontented with the life of a peasant, leaves his village and forges an identity as a noble warrior. But the real samurai, a hereditary position as much as an occupation, see through him instantly and accept him only as an amusing mascot. The imposter is of course Kikuchiyo, the indelible figure brought to life by Toshiro Mifune. Kikuchiyo is Mifune's most complex role and his most powerful performance, more so even than his insane bandit in ""Rashomon"" or his tormented MacBeth (with Japanicized name and backstory) in ""Kumonosujo."" Kikuchiyo, like many of Mifune's characters, is animalistic and ruled by his emotions, but he has an irreducible dignity. It was this sense of dignity that led him to try to escape the hated, thankless life of a peasant, but his anger is also selflessly turned against those who would exploit the farmers whose identity he resentfully shares.As for the farmers, their struggles define the movie. Troubled by bandits, they seek protection from their social superiors, the samurai. But to invite samurai to their village is to go hungry themselves so that the samurai might eat, and to risk the safety and honor of their daughters should the samurai prove immoral. There is even a degree of risk their own lives, should the samurai discover that the townsfolk have resourcefully found a way to profit from the deaths of warriors. It is therefore understandable that the farmers fear and resent the very people they beg for help.A local girl must transgress a barrier by taking on the appearance of a boy, and a young samurai transgresses at least class lines, if not lines of sexuality as well (doubtless there are readings of the film that explore that possibility), by falling in love with her. Their elders, both samurai and peasant, oppose the relationship because they recognize the wide gulf between the two worlds. It is not spelled out, but it can be felt in the acting and in the distant parting shots, that the young samurai would burden the town and not be welcome there when his job is finished. The girl, after the brief romance, seems eager to resume the rhythms of rural life once the bandit crisis has passed.There is more. An aged man and woman have their own perspectives, resentments, and desires informed by their particular experiences. The precarious economic position of samurai, especially masterless and landless ones as Japan's medieval period wound toward its bloody conclusion, receives nods. But to enumerate ""Seven Samurai""'s cultural insights does not do it justice. This is not only a history lesson, but great entertainment. It is the quintessential samurai film, with a perfect cast, strongly-defined characters, well-staged action, a pulsing score, and romantic locations. It is even perhaps the quintessential Japanese film, although Ozu's family dramas and Miyazaki's animations are also required viewing. Yet there is little even in those magnificent movies that Kurosawa's epic does not touch on in some way, just as there is little in the great movies of modern Western cinema that does not owe something to Kurosawa's body of work.",Seven Samurai

It is considered by many critics and cinephiles to be the best samurai movie ever (I put it in my top 3). Everything in this story flows perfectly, starting with the meeting of the seven warriors, their personal conflicts, their ambitions and motives and the way they face battles. It is a film full of symbology (example number 7), with an unpredictable and chaotic narrative, which leaves us glued to the screen during the 3h:30m (yes, it is a very well spent afternoon). Visually it is a milestone in the history of cinema, using techniques and movements characteristic of Kurosawa that until today few can match. I saw this film in a movie theater this week, and I can say it was one of the best experiences in my life regarding films.",Seven Samurai
133,drunken_munki,"A beautiful and haunting story, that has inspired so many",10,6 October 2020,"I love this movie, there is no doubt that many do. This is a masterpiece in every sense of storytelling. The characters define the archetypes that so many shows and films have used and used over the years. The archetypes work here, they are the core of the story. This is the 5th item out of 8 that I have given a perfect 10/10 score.What I admire is that the plot could be written on the back of a cigarette packet. Yet what makes this so engrossing is the character development, the interactions, the dialogue, the stories of the Samurai and Ronin, and the villagers too. The bandits forced the villagers to ask for help. They are poor, so they claim, and they find help in some warriors of old.Kurasawa is a master in telling a story; and with these characters he digs into their past, their ticks, their souls even. You learn about each of the seven warriors quite intimately. Each has different motives to help the villagers, some share a past as soldiers, some are just looking for love. There are some outrageously good character interactions here, and the acting in particular from the amazing Toshirô Mifune is nothing short of mesmerising.This movie also sets another precedent in my opinion. The battle preparation trope used in so many films afterwards as the samurai attempt to prepare the villagers for a defensive battle. They set up traps, barriers, and chokepoints. The samurai position themselves to rally the villagers. They are all hopelessly outnumbered. And yet, with tremendous bravery, the battle is won with heavy costs. This story has since been repeated a thousand times since, and to be honest it will never get old.The story also tells another tale. That of the villagers being greedy and hiding their riches; used to pretending to have nothing. The tale of the samurai raiding and pillaging for their lords. The tale of everyone playing their part, and all they ever really have to show at the end of it is a death count. In some way this story asks us to look at ourselves, and what we are doing to ourselves and each other.The bandits are mostly voiceless and one dimensional... but they also play a part in this story. How did they become a bandit, why join them? It is interesting to think about, any one of the villagers or ronin could have easily become a bandit, given the conditions.The imagery is beautiful, the minuta stories told between all the characters are interesting in their own right. The movie is long but uses its time well. This is one of the early examples of cinema that has taught so many masters after it. That plot doesn't have to be fantastical, have twists, or be complex. All you need is good characters and good writing, and you can hopefully tell any story you want.Kurasawa is a legend and has been missed by all since his passing. This is one of his greatest achievements, and I love it.",Seven Samurai
134,manendra-lodhi,"""Has everything.""",10,13 October 2012,"The film with its huge length shows each and every aspect beautifully. The story is about a village which is living under the fear of the bandits. They hire a group of samurai's to protect them from further raids. One might think a lot before starting the film considering its length but I assure you that it is worth the time. The way that they portrayed each character is extremely commendable.PROS: The film is a blend of everything. It has comedy, courage, difficult times in life, war strategy and many more. The cinematography is good and without flaw. The film gives a view that whole of the village was engaged in the war. Everyone seemed to be working all the times. The story is not as engaging since we know the end, but slowly as the film progresses, we just tend to be with the rhythm that the director has created for the viewer.MESSAGE: ""Fight for what is JUST.""VERDICT: ""Most recommended.""",Seven Samurai
135,simon_booth,Haven't you seen it yet?,10,31 January 2003,"Well, if you haven't seen Seven Samurai then you're not really  qualified to call yourself a film fan, basically. One of the most  influential movies of all time, that still holds up extremely well  nearly 50 years later.  Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of heroism and barbarism set the standard in  so many ways it's hard to imagine that any modern film does not show  its influence in some way or other. A great script, great characters,  mostly great acting, splendid cinematography and action sequences that  wrote the book about how these things should be filmed. Even now, after  so many have tried to imitate or beat it, Seven Samurai remains a  totally gripping 3.5 hour experience.  Akira Kurosawa is one of the gods of Cinema - men who seem to have been  born to make films, who have it in their blood. People like Alfred  Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, King Hu and Steven Spielberg, who make it  look easy... who so obviously ""get it"". In this pantheon, Kurosawa is  perhaps the daddy of them all, however, and Seven Samurai is one of his  finest moments.  The scale of the production is remarkable - to undertake making such an  epic in post-war Japan was a feat in itself. The cast of dozens of  inhabitants of a village specially built for the movie, the 40 bandits  and their horses, all the costumes, the armour, the weapons. Few  directors could have brought all of this together and still paid such  attention to the smallest of details in script and scene. Credit must  go to the team Kurosawa worked with too, I presume   The movie's setup became the template for many movies to follow, the  most recentl example that comes to mind being the excellent Korean  period movie MUSA (The Warrior), for example. A motley band of  characters is assembled and placed in a situation where the odds are  seemingly stacked against them, and each gets there chance to really  shine, prove themselves and become something more than a normal man.  Kurosawa's Samurai movies all share a little bit in common, which is  the depiction of the Samurai as some noble beast, different from the  common and pathetic rabble of ordinary man. In Seven Samurai the  farmers are a base lot, cowardly, selfish, vain, pathetic and  treacherous. How he found actors with such miserable looking faces is a  mystery in itself. In contrast, the Samurai embody all the qualities  that humanity would generally like to believe define it (us). Brave,  righteous, honest, strong and heroic. Toshiro Mifune's character stands  in the middle and represents this difference - perhaps meant to suggest  that mankind can strive to rise above his flaws, but mostly suggesting  to me that the common man is basically a mess and we should learn to  respect our betters. Kurosawa was definitely not a socialist, unless  I'm mis-reading him wildly.  I'm sure many out there wonder, does a 50 year old black and white  movie about Samurai really have any interest or relevance to us in the  21st century? The answer is a definite ""Yes!"". Seven Samurai shows us  what cinema can be, what cinema is *meant* to be. It is moving picture  as art in a way that the multiplex-fillers of today cannot possibly  claim to be. It's a film that satisfies on many different levels, and  still provides a bench mark which today's film makers could and should  use to evaluate their own contributions. True, few out there will ever  be able to claim they've made a film that rivals Seven Samurai in scope  or beauty, but this *is* what every director should aspire to! The sad  thing is, I just can't see a project like this ever coming out of the  Hollywood studio system, where art is just another commodity and  marketing is the new god",Seven Samurai
136,Ziya90,Kurosawa extends the story excessively and the movie itself is so pale,6,19 January 2010,"My favorite Kurosawa film is Throne of Blood, Hidden Fortress follows it and the third is Ran or Ikiru. As for Seven Samurai, In IMDb, the ratings higher than 8.5 are almost equal to 10 which means a masterpiece. I don't complain about the duration of the movies and if I feel sleepy or get bored (even if I get bored very rarely), I give up watching and watch the rest of the film the next day! However, the problem here is a bit different. The film was unnecessarily long for such a story. That causes it to lose its effect minute by minute. A group of farmers in a village decide to hire a few retired samurai to get rid of the racketeers. It would be great, if such a simple story had been told in 100 minutes. Unfortunately, Seven Samurai is one of the longest movies of all time! I mean the DVD version, I guess that the number of the people who got a chance to see the international version is not many. I forgot the main story totally after a while, loosed my attention. the story was scattered. Secondly, Seven Samurai is not artistic like other Kurosawa movies, it is the most pale, the most plain Kurosawa film ever. The content is so pale also, the story telling is pale. You watch, watch, watch and watch... By the way, some people say that Seven Samurai is an action film. There is only one action sequence in the whole film which takes place near the end!!! and it was pretty short. Therefore mind!, don't expect an action movie or a real samurai movie. This is a drama about Japanese farmers and a group of Samurai. In Ikiru, the last part had seemed me excessive or unnecessary either and made me think that sometimes, Kurosawa extends the story unnecessarily, but then I realized that the part was the heart of the film (İkiru) so I changed my mind. However, I would not say the same thing for Seven Samurai. It was too excessive like its rating.",Seven Samurai
137,robertguttman,An Absolute Must-See,10,22 September 2016,"The Seven Samurai is one of those movies that should be on every true film-lover's list of movies that they absolutely must see at least once in their lives. It is a true epic motion picture but, like all great epics, it's story is essentially a simple and universal one. A gang of bandits have been preying upon a village of defenseless Japanese farmers. The Farmers finally decide that they are not going to take it any more, and resolve to hire unemployed Samurai warriors to fight for them. That is essentially all there is to the basic story although, naturally, there is a lot more to it. The seven Samurai that the farmers manage to hire are all vividly delineated characters, all of whom decide to hire on for their own different reasons.The farmers are also finely-drawn characters, each with their own individual strengths and weaknesses.Although set in 16th Century Japan, the story of the Seven Samurai is so universal that it resonates equally in all cultures. Small wonder that it has been successfully remade as an American Western. It could just as easily be remade in a setting of Medieval Western Europe, Ancient Greece or Rome, pre-colonial Africa, Medieval China, ancient India, pre-Columbian America, as a science-fiction film set on another planet, or in any other setting that one might care to name. Nevertheless, Akira Kurosawa's original Japanese version is so good that it remains the best of all versions. Yes, it is 3 1/2 hours long. Yes, it is in Japanese. Yes, it is in black-and-white. Nevertheless, despite the length, the foreign language and the lack of color photography, this movie NEVER loses the viewer's interest for a moment. The Seven Samurai is one of the truly timeless classic movies that never gets old.",Seven Samurai
138,lyubitelfilmov,Ronin vs. Bandits or Japanese Annihilation,9,28 November 2020,"Historical drama. The second picture of the famous, legendary and cult Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, which is aimed at the eye of your favorite and most authoritative Russian film critic (just kidding!). In fact, it's just a legendary picture that passed me by for quite a long time, until now I got to it, and here's my brief opinion - Ronins against bandits. I will say right away that despite the cult status and a huge army of fans around the world, I still found flaws in this picture, and I will write them, no matter how fans try not to notice them, and of course I will not forget about the merits. Therefore, sit back, pour strong tea, and enjoy the review of the legend of the world cinema.
So, the advantages:
1. The story told - Japan at the end of the sixteenth century. Sengoku Jidai - the era of the warring provinces. A civil war has been raging in the country for many years. Blood is pouring everywhere, fields are turning into places of fierce battles, devastated villages are burning everywhere, bandits are in charge of the roads. Inhabitants of one of the villages are harassed by a gang, and they are in despair, and for protection they hire seven ronin, who must end the gang. The script skeleton has been repeated many times in world cinema, the most famous and successful attempt is the American Western ""The Magnificent Seven"" (which I watched, and the writers were able to perfectly adapt to the Wild West, and not stupidly copied the scenes, as Sergio Leone did). The story does not shine with originality, but it catches with the elaboration of the characters and well-written dialogues that allow the viewer to feel the characters and begin to empathize with them. Akira himself was again responsible for the script, and again he coped with this task perfectly. And while there are a few rustles in it, that doesn't diminish its overall quality. Moreover, such a story could have happened in reality. If you like pictures with a good and thoughtful script, where you don't even want to find fault, then you definitely come here.
2. Atmosphere - Japan during the civil war, with its familiar attributes: samurai (here mostly ronin), their swords, feudal system, oppressed peasantry, horrors of civil war, and so on. The sets and costumes perfectly complement this unique and inimitable Japanese culture. If you love this, you are welcome.
3. The relationship between ronin and peasants - at first it seems that the peasants are the most unfortunate people in the country (they are all oppressed, beaten, and no one cares about them as long as there is no need to collect taxes), and after twenty minutes I sincerely sympathized them (the actors literally got used to the role), but later, as the characters were revealed, I realized that both peasants and ronins are people in whom both good and bad are combined. There are no angels and demons here. Some demons gave birth to others, some brought misfortune to others. Through dialogues, we begin to understand this tumbling and gradually the history of this and similar conflicts in this country is revealed to us. And also the romantic line, which exacerbates these relationships and contradictions between peasants and ronins.
4. Defending the village is not just about swinging ropes and sticking bamboo sticks into the bodies of hated bandits. Rhonin use tactics and think strategically, which reduces the chances of bandits, although they have a large numerical superiority, to zero. Fights and battles are dynamic, although it will be difficult to call them exciting.
5. Humor - Akira added a good humor to the script, which could make me laugh (and I'm sure not only me) completely sincerely and shamelessly. Bravo Akira!
So the cons:
1. The finale - don't you think, it is logical and expected, and filmed just fine. One only embarrassed - the understatement, and exactly where it was needed. I understood the symbolism (not a fool), the conclusion is also clear, but for the understatement I personally will never forgive Akira!
2. Duration - three and a half hours - this is the timing of this picture. Well, thanks for having an intermission in the middle. And don't get me wrong, long timing allows you to tell the story in great detail, without omitting details. But there are moments here that Akira has clearly drawn out, especially the long and languid looks without words. This is symbolism again, but Akira, could it be made shorter? After all, the tone of the picture practically does not change, and if you do not focus on the story, you can completely calmly fall asleep, and wake up only at the end.
Well, the battle itself cannot boast of the spectacularity of the battle today, but let's make a discount on the release time of the picture.
A little about the main characters:
1. Shimada Kambey performed by Takashi Shimura is the leader of the ronin and the most experienced warrior of all, and also the ""brain"" of the entire defense. He shows himself as a good person and an experienced military leader who fights well himself. Takashi perfectly embodied this image on the big screen.
2. Okamoto Katsushiro, performed by Isao Kimura, who has impudently become a student of Kambey, whom the latter uses as an ""errand boy"" and protects in every possible way. He shows himself as a brave and brave warrior who intends to become the best samurai. Isao played this role no less convincingly.
3. Kikuchiyo performed by Toshiro Mifune is the most interesting and memorable ronin in the company. He behaves insolently, funny and very resourceful, more than once helping out the heroes. He is also a tragic character who hides grief behind the laugh. And his monologue in one of the scenes is just great, especially with emotions. Toshiro was able to surprise me this time too. Bravo Toshiro! Bravo!
Honestly, it would be better to call the picture ""Seven Ronin"", but then there would be consonance with 47 ronin.
Well, there is only one picture left ""Dersu Uzala"", shot by Akira, joint production of the USSR and Japan.
As a result, we have an excellent historical drama of the legendary Akira Kurosawa, with an excellent script, great atmosphere and humor, costumes and sets and great acting work.",Seven Samurai
139,JaydoDre,Interesting but fails in a couple of crucial aspects,7,11 May 2018,"The story of the Seven Samurai is not a cliché but it is treading an existing type of movie, namely a type of movie in which the story builds to an important event. This event will test several characters, showing how they deal with the said event and with one another. Normally, the formula to such a movie requires the first 80% of the movie to be devoted to showing the backstory of each character who will be present for the final event. This is necessary because you have multiple characters and you need to understand the backstory of each of them as well as the relationships between them in order to understand and fully appreciate their behaviour during the final event. Seven Samurai gives a little bit of an introduction for each character, but not much. Not long after seeing this movie, I have completely forgotten 3 out of the 7 samurai. And I would only be able to describe the characters of 2 out of the 7 people, and only briefly. It is not a spoiler to say that some of the samurai are not going to make it out alive, but it's hard to care when the characters are so undeveloped.As for the acting in this movie, it is a matter of taste. The Japanese sometimes have a really expressive line delivery, which is most evident in anime production. This delivery is aided by the fact that the Japanese language, even when spoken at a conversational speed, can easily be made to sound more pressurised than Western languages, with a lot of harsh ""zh"" and ""sh"" mushed together for effect. And in addition to that, older movies in general seem to suffer from overenthusiastic acting - a leftover from the theatrical era when it was actually necessary due to the distance between the performers and the viewers. Perhaps as a result of all 3 of these factors, there is a lot of overacting in this film. Specifically, Toshiro Mifune's character was given artistic license to physical improvisation by the director and Toshiro ran with it all the way to cartoon-land. I felt a physical need to look away during some of the scenes because it just got too weird for me to handle. That is not to say that the acting is bad. It's great but very stylised.I read that the reason why Toshiro was given the liberty to go nuts is because the director was worried that the movie would otherwise be too quiet and boring. He was sort of right, because when you remove Toshiro's character and his contribution to the themes concerning the position and identity of the peasant class, the film is just a story about a few people coming together and then fighting off an attack. It moves slowly, at almost 3 hours long, and not all of the scenes feel necessary.The good part is that, despite of it all the shortcomings, the film remains entertaining. The scenes are shot with competence. I am just somewhat surprised to see all the overwhelmingly positive reactions to this film.",Seven Samurai
140,faraaj-1,Simply magnificent,10,20 October 2006,"Seven Samurai's reputation speaks for itself as testified by its IMDb ranking and the veneration it is held in by other film-makers. Apart from being possibly the first true action film, it inspired countless remakes. Some, such as the American western The Magnificent Seven or the Indian Sholay are excellent, while countless more are more obscure and not very good (one or two Indian versions come to mind but I can't even remember their names!). Many great films were inspired by Seven Samurai. Names that come to mind include The Wild Bunch and Assault on Precinct 13.Based on these credentials alone, Seven Samurai is a classic. However, it is also a marvelously entertaining, epic and very richly textured movie. Each of the seven samurai and many of the villagers has a complete and identifiable personality - warts and all. The various classes - samurai, farmer and bandit - are carefully delineated.The long sequence of the attack on the village and how it is defended is amazing and one of the greatest feats of film direction. The generalship of Takashi Shimura is inspiring and intelligent. There is a lot of violence and the gritty reality is portrayed not through flying limbs but through the rain-soaked warriors, the mud, the horses slipping - brilliant. The bitter-sweet ending was perfect.Beware: if you have never seen Seven Samurai before, try to watch the directors cut which clocks in at 206 minutes. There are other ""mutilated"" version but none does a story of this scope and magnitude justice.",Seven Samurai
141,honorhorror,The 3rd 10/10 I gave in 2008. Which means it is not dated at all.,10,11 April 2008,"Stand the test of time? Definitely. Seven Samurai is maybe the best epic movie I've ever seen for many different reasons. It may surpass LOTR for many reasons. I will show them here.1, It is maybe the grandpa, or the great-grandpa of LOTR movies. And it has definitely more human side than LOTR for the excellent performances by the assemble cast. All the 7 samurais shine in their roles and even the supporting roles gave you very realistic memories.2, Without CGI in that age, all the effects are heavily relying on the real-set arts, which put any director to test for their skills. And, the effects of every battle are simply impressive as if you are a part of the battle.3, Again, taking the realistic elements into account, we see the real sides of humanity, without jeopardizing the good values the movie wants to promote. According to writer/director Akira, the movie intended to show the ideal samurais in Japanese culture, while he wanted a realistic storyline. Plus, people die in the movie, no matter how important they are to the audiences. 4 samurais died after in the battle, who all were killed by gunshot. You may regret for them, and the rest of samurais justified this loss by saying, ""we didn't win, the farmers did."" They fought idealistically, and they paid the prices. In LOTR the main characters including non-soldier characters just survived every great battle,which, if compare to Seven Samurais, would be silly.You can actually enjoy it in many different ways. You may take it for a pure Japanese movie, or you can consider it a international production, a gift to all the audiences in the world.Perfection starts with a good screenplay.",Seven Samurai
142,sandnair87,Akira Kurosawa's Jidai-Geki Epic Showcases His Bravura Filmmaking!,9,9 February 2016,"Akira Kurosawa's jidai-geki epic 'Seven Samurai' can be counted among the greatest of all battle movies - a majestic tale of heroism, sacrifice and death, that remains unmatched, even today. Set in 1587, it follows the story of a village of farmers that hire seven master-less samurai to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops. The displaced samurai - seven sword-swinging, bow-and-arrow footmen of varied courage and personality - put aside class differences in order to defend the village that has been the unfortunate target of the gang of marauding bandits for a long time. The first half where the lead samurai gathers his troops and journeys to the village, is fascinating, full of vigor and life. But the second half - where the samurai train the peasant villagers to fight and then take on the bandit horde, resisting wave after wave of horseback assaults with sword and rifle in the driving rain, the bandits battering against the improvised fortifications, trading deaths until the last rifle shot and sword-slash - is one of the most thrilling sustained passages of action cinema ever.On that simple framework and familiar storyline, director Akira Kurosawa plasters a wealth of rich detail, which brilliantly illuminates his characters and the kind of action in which they are involved. We feel the warfare so intensely because of his mastery of staging and editing the violence. But we also feel the film because the characters are so strong, especially the seven samurai themselves: heroes in the truest sense, but also convincingly idiosyncratic and human. The film's three and a half hour length is more than justified by the intricate character development of both the samurai and the villagers, as both groups let go of class biases to accomplish their mutual goal of fortifying the village. The legendary Takashi Shimura as the ageing, and oddly charismatic leader and Toshirô Mifune as the arrogant ronin looking to outdo his compatriots lead a superb cast, and Kurosawa's kinetic camera keeps the adventure sizzling with energy and wit from start to finish. By the climactic showdowns against the bandits, a palpable anxiety is present due to the great affinity the audience feels for the characters.Rich in detail, vivid in characterization and leisurely in exposition, Seven Samurai is bravura filmmaking. Akira Kurosawa synthesizes the traditions of the samurai narrative and the American western to create an intimate epic with deeply felt ground-level consequences. While doing so, he deflates the myth of the noble samurai without actually debunking it and sends a dark thrill through his audience with a touch of sensuous physical reality.",Seven Samurai
143,dkncd,Samurai for hire,8,23 September 2007,"""Seven Samurai"" is Akira Kurosawa's film about a village in feudal Japan that hires samurai in order to fend off bandit incursions. It has garnered pretty much unanimous critical praise. Featured in the film are impressive scenes and sets, but the score, while it has its moments, is nothing special.""Seven Samurai"" can be divided into two distinct phases. The first phase is where the villagers seek to hire the samurai, which emphasizes characterization. The seven samurai (though not all of them are samurai in the strict sense) are all developed with distinct and interesting personalities, as are members of the supporting cast. There are too many great character moments in this film to count. I particularly liked Takashi Shimura as Kambei Shimada, the rational and calculating ""ronin"" (samurai with no master) that becomes the leader of the seven, Toshirô Mifune as Kikuchiyo, the bombastic samurai, always ready with insults and mocking facial expressions, Daisuke Katô as Shichiroji, a young warrior eager to earn glory in battle and a supporting performance from Kokuten Kodo as Gisaku, the sagely village patriarch.The second phase puts the characters developed into the inevitable conflict against the bandits. The battle scenes are nicely shot and well-staged. It was nice how the film took the time to develop the battlefield before the battle with scenes of key strategic points and even a map of the village and immediate surrounding area. The ending of the film was well-written and very interesting. Admittedly, though, that despite its characterization and well-staged battle scenes, I found ""Seven Samurai"" to be slow at points and generally the film seemed long. None the less, ""Seven Samurai"" is in essence a good film with an impressive critical reputation and is worth a look.",Seven Samurai

And when the climax hits, it hits BIG TIME! The score is fantastic and syncs with the movie perfectly. What is so impressive about this movie is that I am watching it over 60 years after it first came out and find that it still holds up amazingly. The influence this movie has had throughout the history of cinema is notably seen in Westerns, for example. This movie requires commitment, as it is over 3 hours long, not for casual viewers.

The samurai was like the wind, rolling across the earth, and those farmers were always with the earth and lived forever.

Nothing is prettified (in the moral/social sense...several scenes are quite beautiful though), and the grim situation of people fighting for their lives and livelihoods is as gripping as I've ever seen in a movie.It's a long movie, but seldom boring...there are excitement, humor, drama in turn.

However, this is a great movie, filled with fascinating shots, great characters, message and dialogue. Some great quotes are thrown around in here, like ""This is the nature of war. By protecting others, you save yourselves."" And I think this is the main theme of the film. What's in it for these warriors to protect the farmers? Not glory, money or women. Only rice is offered to them and a roof above their head. It's a noble cause to help these poor people and Kurosawa makes a brilliant statement in his way of letting the viewer know the suffering and the desperation of these people. All of the samurai have interesting personalities and of course, the standout being Kikuchiyo, the loud-mouth, eccentric, often show-off character, who is only trying to win the approval of the samurai. And he is a hero and a great character. It is a great film, indeed.",Seven Samurai

Kurosawa's imagery is so beautifully framed and has an amazing depth-of-field to almost every shot. The sense of depth carries out to every corner of the film.The story is an ageless one of unselfishness. The acting impeccable, this film brings a powerful punch to your stomach and a knot in your heart at every viewing. This isn't merely a Japanese ""western"", Seven Samurai is much more than that. This is a picture too few have seen.While the Godfather is the trendy choice of best film ever made (and it is quite good) Seven Samurai is so timeless, so truthful, so genuine, and so powerful I can't think of any other film that even comes close.",Seven Samurai
149,FilmSnobby,The real Magnificent Seven.,9,28 November 2003,"Given carte blanche after the worldwide successes of  *Rashomon*  and *Ikiru*, Akira Kurosawa embarked on creating what amounted to a new national epic -- *Seven Samurai*.  In the process, he changed movies forever.You know the story even if you've never seen the movie:  the citizens of a rural village, weary of being harassed by a local gang of bandits, recruit a rag-tag group of seven samurai warriors to help defend their homes.  The only pay the farmers can offer to the samurai is three squares a day.  Just the right inducement for these adventurers, led by Takashi Shimura as the wise leader, and Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune as a wanna-be samurai whose antecedents were farmers.The story doesn't amount to much, but Kurosawa more than compensates for this lack of complexity by creating about 10 interesting characters and by setting a whole new standard for action scenes in the cinema.  Therefore, the 3.5-hour length of the movie certainly isn't a handicap, unless good drama and well-choreographed action are too much for your CGI-conditioned brain.Which brings me to a point:  I tend to read a dozen or so IMDb reviews of a film before I add my own comments for this website, and I did so with *Seven Samurai*.  It was rather disheartening to keep reading, over and over, even from those who LIKED the movie, that it's  ""pretty good for a black & white movie"".  Or, ""pretty good for an old movie"".  Or, ""pretty good for a foreign movie"".  Uh, yeah.  *Seven Samurai*  is pretty good, OK?  Even if it's an old, black & white foreign movie.  What's with the xenophobia and the complete lack of appreciation for film history?  I'm glad that everyone has found this masterpiece  ""good enough""  for today's standards, but in the meantime let me offer a tip:  it's the recent, Hollywood movies -- in color -- that tend to suck.  OK?  *Seven Samurai*  needs no apologies for being black & white, Japanese, and old.",Seven Samurai

None, however, has arguably been as internationally acclaimed as the late Akira Kurosawa.This movie in particular is one of the greatest examples of his greatness. It's a simple, yet effective drama about samurai protecting the innocents for pay. What makes it so fantastic is everything from the pacing of the story, the acting and action scenes - it just works so incredibly well.The narrative is very compelling - portraying the samurai as more realistic human like characters rather than chivalreous heroes. It's so iconic that this story, as well as Kurosawa's other films, have been adapted and remade in numerous films througouht the years - The Magnificent Seven comes closest to mind, but also Star Wars The Mandalorian.Overall, a fantastic film that everyone should have watched!",Seven Samurai

This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.  Akira Kurosawa created one of the most enduring stories that transcend national boundaries in both its simplicity and intricacy.Takashi Shimura provides what I believe is truly the best performance in the film, and the leader of the samurai.  I know a lot of the focus is on Toshiro Mifune's farmer-turned-samurai and his over-the-top (though excellent) performance, but I believe that Shimura-sama is who really makes this film.  The understated wisdom and strength in his character provides the foundation for all the other performances.  I believe Takashi Shimura should rightfully rank up there with the greatest actors of our time...and anyone seeing him in Ikuru will undoubtedly agree. Hopefully he will be given his proper recognition some day in America, where he is probably more widely known for being the scientist in the first Godzilla movie.Go out and buy this DVD.

152,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A quintessential Kurosawa classic,10,19 April 2009,"Shichinin no samurai is a quintessential Kurosawa movie, and probably his greatest lagniappe to the world of cinema. Shichinin no samurai is a classic example of a profound character study well complemented by some ingenious direction and breathtaking cinematography. The world of cinema owes a colossal debt to the master movie-maker and plethora of his sui generis works such as this one. The movie depicts penury with sheer brilliance and uncanny resplendence. The inexorable resolve exhibited by the destitute villagers to fight the rapacious bandits can be inspiring even to the most pessimistic. The fidelity shown by the samurai to the villagers, each hired for a bowl of rice, accentuates the very essence of humanity. The movie's slow pace and its poignant background score enriches it with a sense of melancholy, thereby making it truly mesmerizing to watch. The entire cast has performed really well, taking care of the nuances with utmost precision and incredible conviction. Kurosawa's plaintive storytelling, coupled with his subtle brilliance, makes the movie a truly ineffable experience for the viewer. PS. Though not meant for everyone, the movie is sine qua non for cineastes and avid lovers of pristine cinema. It's also a great means to get acquainted with Kurosawa's oeuvre before exploring his more personal works like Rashomon, Ikiru, Ran, etc.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",Seven Samurai

The insurrection is unfailing and natural response to abuse insatiable. The man assumes and takes up the same nature as man surpasses his relationship with her, then, the balance point should be maintained, and when someone is exceeded, you will always receive the necessary request for temperance.""Seven Samurai"" is a painstaking recreation of the process and impetuous that is happening in a class struggle. It reports on the events that initiate the usurpation of some over others, denounced the economic, social and emotional iniquity and then describes in detail how a people prepared, tired, to overthrow the enemy ... and always the universe will create the conditions for this to happen.In a magnificent setting, impeccably photographed, and an acting presence that gives an accurate account of the most varied personalities of any people, a flood of feelings, strong relationships and principles applied in all its dimensions, spring from this very interesting film has left a deep impression. The story could be divided into three parts: 1.Conflict and recruitment. 2. Preparation for the defense and 3. The battle. The first two are my master, full of inner strength and exulting in the art of defense, not for nothing, is now legendary. But in honor of objectivity, I confess that I am attracted little long battles. All this part of me is excessive, cartoonish overloaded with cameras fast (taken seriously), with more than a loose plane sustained more by affection than by the road as effectively within the context... and thus, the climax loses weight and hardly recovered in the reflexive closure, with undeniable wit, Kurosawa gives us. I conclude by celebrating the powerful histrionics of the great Toshiro Mifune, who, as Kikushio, builds an endearing character.And I recognize Takashi Shimura, the master samurai Shinata, who fills the film human commitment and dignity at all costs. Notable.",Seven Samurai
154,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Still has lots to offer,7,24 May 2021,"Much better than I expected, especially as Seven Samurai had been on my watch list for a decade and I naturally assumed that it would be an overrated and antiquated bombshell full of technicalities and political maneuvering, but I couldn't have been more wrong - it's a warm, endearing and very enchanting character piece with lots of comradery and strangely expressive affection.Unfortunately, the movie is too long and lacks real excitement, which feels rather old fashioned and quaint due to the annoyingly pathetic villagers and their lack of competence and exaggerated sense of fear, as well as some very protracted fight scenes that lack modern grit and punch, including the non-sequiturs in final battles and ensuing comments such as ""they're not going to fall for that one again"", followed by them falling for it all over again (and again). It's just common sense really, but the attacking bandits are just as wooden and brain-dead as the poor villages.There are also some misogynistic attitudes, which is a concern these days, with women having no other purpose than fodder for men to marginalize, but for all these concerns, there is a lot to like in Samurai and I found it surprisingly pleasing and enchanting.As for the abundant 10/10 ratings - you're entitled to love whatever you wish - but realistically, although this might have been one of the best movies on offer back in the 1950s, this doesn't translate effectively to the modern day. It's still surprisingly good in places though and many of the characters are great, although I can't see myself enduring 3.5 hours again to enhance my endearment for this movie.",Seven Samurai
155,KingM21,Check this masterpiece out.,9,2 September 2005,"I finally got around to watching this legendary film, which, coincidently, was also my first Kurosawa experience. Neither was a disappointment. Seven Samurai really was an excellent picture and it's easy to see the influence this film has had, especially when keeping in mind that it was released way back in 1954. Kurosawa's direction is masterful yet stylish in this multi-layered film and the variety of characters are all wonderfully portrayed by the actors, with Toshirô Mifune giving a particularly lively and emotional performance. On top of all this, this classic is simply entertaining, a fine mixture of good humor and realistic action. Yep, all film fans would do themselves a favor to check this masterpiece out. The Criterion DVD (and I've read rumors of yet a third release!) only includes a commentary by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck but with a running time of 203 minutes, it's quite a worthy extraJeck knows his Kurosawa!",Seven Samurai

I had burgundy.After taping this film off TCM months ago, I finally sat down to watch it on a cold, gray day, and was bored to tears. At the intermission, I decided to give it a rest until the next day. Picking up the story on day two, I found it a little more exciting, but really, the story of the 7 guys joining up to help poor villagers fight off bandits is only as interesting as the characters are revealed. And these guys are just not that interesting. As a 1954 film, the style is for very long takes where we just see someone grimacing or staring or standing or whatever. And lots of running around to no purpose. Please! That is not good. It is a ""moving"" picture, for goodness sake, but should make some sense.Maybe it is a generational thing, or gender. As an older woman, I just did not care what happened by ""the end.""

157,kekca,My rating: 7,7,30 July 2013,"The movie is great, as is its director. My assessment, however is equal to the number of samurai there are in it. Not that Kurosawa did not make a good movie - on the contrary, but the reputation of this is not enough to make it the best of all his other films.This is the oldest film in which I first saw the camera to shoot one shot going around in circles (probably put on a train on rails). The story, undoubtedly, is very interesting. These are still a bunch of samurai and social issues: who is a ruler - the strong or the weak? Of who think the strong ones - for themselves or for the others? What is the meaning of help, and so on and so forth.I'm a little critical of the finale of the film, which ended with a single line, immediately after a half-hour-long battle. This removed part of the pleasure to watch film of Kurosawa. Therefore conclude here.

A ""Feel Good"" Movie With Heroes Who Win In The End....But With Both Class And Depth! ------------------------------The odds of a movie project ending up as good as The Seven Samaurai (1954) ended up (one of the best of the best in all movie history) are the same as the odds of a couple trying to conceive a child (""make a baby"") who, they hope, ends up being a world class artist like Shakespeare or MichaelangeloWhen a movie ends up being as much of a winner as this movie was (is), it must be treasured, and certainly screened over and over and over by anyone who cares for cinema.It's so good, there's no way to say how good it is really....one can only comment, state emphatically, that it's wonderful, and thank heaven for that.Everything is right, everything works...the script, the direction, the acting, the set decoration, the camera work, the editing.....let me count the ways.The depiction of violent, out of control weather elements in The Seven Samaurai 1954) is memorable. The story characters face a hostile, severe physical world, only sometimes gentle and cooperative, but often brutal and oppressive.Kurasawa, the director, used the sounds and image of violent pouring water in Rashomon (1950) from which players in the movie were forced to huddle. We see this again in The Seven Samaurai (1954).We see drenching down-pouring rain pouring torrentially over the fragile retreats where movie characters huddle. We see characters wallowing in deep, oppressive mud and large, deep mud puddles which dominate the landscape and the world where the story is set. Violent winds blow across the land, bending young trees and old ones alike, and creating dust clouds, lifting dirt into the air. Thick mist and fog are part of rain soaked vistas, all part of the rural Japan setting.The violent, pounding hoof beats of the villain bandit horses are heard throughout the movie, and the power of the horses themselves are shown brilliantly. The villains are well equipped and powerful in ways the hero Samaurai cannot match. The power of the horses, and the horsemen who ride the horses (bandits) are depicted memorably.Japan has a great tradition of stage acting and stage drama, and the movie actors part of the story come from that world, and do very well in front of the camera. We see wonderful character actors and dramatic actors alike.One of the most memorable parts of the movie is simply the way the actors run with great speed and power....actors of both genders seen running relatively short distances, but with great urgency, purpose, and sheer physical power. One seldom sees people running with the skill and dramatic meaning frequently depicted in The Seven Samaurai (1954).The two headline people part of the movie, Akira Kurasawa (the director) and Toshiro Mifune (the lead actor), went on to stormy futures after the movie was made and rightly heralded as a permanent world classic in 1954, now (2012) almost 60 years ago.Just like Orson Welles after Citizen Kane (1941).Movies are one of the great art forms ever in human history, and this movie proves that is so.Watch it, again and again and again.....you'll never be sorry.-------------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG-AFTRA movie actor.

162,joshuafagan-64214,A Shining Steel Flower of the East,10,20 November 2015,"The plot is simple. A village has been attacked by roving bandits, so they hire 7 Samurai to protect them. And that's it; that's the movie. I doubt any Western filmmaker, even the great David Lean, could have put together an interesting four hour film about that without blowing it up to a grander physical scale. But here this film is. Yes, it sometimes lags a bit, but it never stops being interesting.I understand this might not be everyone's cup of tea. If you're not the sort of person who can even tear yourself away from ninety minute romcoms to watch The Godfather, this movie is not for you. But if you love film or history or philosophy or just seeing things done really well, this film is for you.It's one of those films where you remember the first time you saw it. Mine was on a warm summer day in July, not long after my trip to Costa Rica. I started it an seven and finished around eleven-thirty (I took a short break to eat lunch). Right after I saw it, I went with my mom to the grocery store. Through that trip and all through that day, I never stopped thinking about this movie. It impacted me in the sort of way that is forever and profound and sunbright. I felt different, like I had just witnessed a transcendental event. Which I guess I had. When you watch a film like this, both long and impossibly good, you feel so enriched and immersed in its world and characters that you feel like you've left planet Earth. You don't feel like you're walking on clouds per se. It's too substantial for that. You feel like you've set foot on another planet and yours is just a faint twinkle in the magenta-green sky.Okay, me. Stop floating off into magnificent reverie and get down to film analysis. When this film and many of Kurokawa's latter works were released, they were criticized for being 'too Western.' This is absurd as a complaint; no respected film critic would drill an American movie for being 'too Eastern.' But you can see their point. This film is more focused on individuality and rebelling; at least by Japanese standards. It certainly isn't completely accurate to the values of the time; not that I'm complaining. To Western audiences, it is probably a bit more satiable than, say, Tokyo Story, even with the four hour running time.Nothing is without weight. Even if you are not comfortable with watching a movie this long- and you really should make an exception for this film- you cannot deny that nothing is just pure filler. Everything adds to the sprawling web of storytelling that they are trying to create.As a side note, can I say how weird it is that people are often unwilling to watch any movie that exceeds three hours, but are perfectly fine with sitting back and binge-watching ten hours of a television show on Netflix. I'm not condemning this- if I were, I'd be straight about it- but rather intrigued by it. Maybe I'll drop a piece about the differences between movies in television in that and many other regards. Probably not. But it is nonetheless something worth taking a look in.Anyways, the movie is pretty dark. Not dark as in the gritty, angsty, post-apocalyptic, brownish connotations that word seems to take on here in America. But dark as in thematically dark; they don't show any heads being chopped off or collar bones flying through the air because they don't need to. Not saying that it's the only right way to go; but it is a right way to go. They leave the explicit darkness to the very well-done script.There have been more than a few articles that call this the first true action movie; and I can see where they are coming from. I never have been much of a fan of action sequences; my brain kind of glosses them out (yes, I'm weird); but I can tell when they are done well and when they are, well, not. And this is the first and perhaps the only old film I've seen that did them well. While I myself am not comfortable calling it 'the first', as I don't make a business out of watching old movies unless I'm sure that they're really good, I will say that the action is good enough to make me forget I'm watching a movie from the early fifties. Seriously; if you want a good laugh, go check out some of the other so-called action sequences that were being filmed around this time.All that action results in death; dirty, inglorious deaths. I'm not going to tell you who dies (that would a spoiler, something I try to avoid on these reviews), but I will say that enough people bite it to make the film's themes feel alive and resonant. There is never a sense that they are killing characters off just for the sake of killing them off. Everything has power.Perhaps the best comparison to this film is to those buildings in Ancient Japan that were created slowly, generation after generation, revealing an enormous accomplishment that has continued to wow people in the millennia since. The West could never make either; perhaps even the Modern East couldn't make them. But here they remain, a towering relic from a bygone era waiting to be embraced.P.S. Stick it out to the end. The last fifteen minutes or so of this movie are some of the most potent and loaded and electrifying and well-acted I've ever seen.",Seven Samurai

Takashi Shimura plays a noble samurai who leads his group of fellow samurais to defend a small village. He's a good man, he's down to earth and caring. Strangely enough, he looks exactly like Morgan Freeman in this movie. No doubt because Mr. Freeman has learned quite a lot of his acting from this character and from Takashi's immense skills as an actor.The other six samurais are equally well portrayed, with the crazy and honour-seeking Kikuchiyo and the young and enthusiastic Katsushiro(who is ever-present in this kind of movie today) standing out as the two most memorable characters.The setting, old Japan, is well-made and feels very real. The clash between old and new is also present, for example how the bandits bring three guns, and how they use them cowardly and unfairly. At very few points in Seven Samurai are you aware you're watching a movie. The acting, camera-work and the super-tight script lure you in, and by the time of the final battle, you care about the characters more than they care about themselves.Recommended to anyone with a remote interest in movie history or just good movies in general. If you feel it's slow in the beginning, hang on! It's worth it.",Seven Samurai

169,jofitz27,Pretty much flawless,10,2 May 2005,"Whoever said 'The Last Samurai' was a great samurai/action movie or even worse, the best one ever, was bang out of line. What's more, they should see this. This is an epic; rich, thorough and action-packed. Not a snip cut straight to action film like 'Die Hard' or 'S.W.A.T.'; this is pure, well thought out and magnificently acted.A small village in 16th Century Japan always gets robbed by bandits in the Autumn when their crops are the most ripe. This leads the village to death and starvation, and one year, in a distraught state, they figure that they can take no more.Seeking judgement at the wisest of the village, they are told that they must seek out Samurai for protection. They have no proper wealth; the only thing they can offer is food; three meals as day, for as long as can be required.It sounds simple, but this film, the characters, the set-pieces; all top notch. Akira Kurosawa manages to get the utmost out of his characters, all of them completely believable and real, as you see their emotional trek throughout the films absolutely incredible three hour running time.Never boring, always involving and endlessly absorbing, the Seven Samurai is a rarity; an action film so rich, thorough and and exciting it seems as if it were a miracle sent down by the gods.10 out of 10",Seven Samurai

In seven samurai, there are courage, wisdom, cooperation, the suffering life of farmers, the gap between farmers and samurai class, and what I like most is the optimistic atmosphere which is filled with under heavy pressure from time to time.

172,GyatsoLa,Mud and guts,10,9 June 2007,"OK, everything that can be said about this movie has already been said. I wouldn't normally give a 10 for a movie, as that implies perfection, and what is perfect? But the reality is that this movie deserves a 10 as it is quite simply the best action movie ever made. Before I saw this I thought Apocalypse Now and Das Boot could not be topped, but this movie does it. Almost every scene in it is stunning - the rhythm, the vitality of the movie is amazing. Its long - very long - but I didn't want it to end.Since i don't want to bore everyone with reiterating what everyone else has said about the cinematic technique here, I would just like to comment on one particular element - the realism of the battle scenes. In the overwhelming majority of action or war movies, fight scenes are in some way stylized. But it is clear from this movie and others Kurosawa made that he had in common with Stanley Kubrick a fascination with the techniques of battle (I'm thinking in particular of 'Spartacus'). He takes great care to show us the geography of the village - the hills to one side, the open fields, the forest to the edge. He shows us how real battle hardened warriors would approach its defense. He shows how men would be killed in reality - not dramatic man to man sword fights, but a ruthless strategy to isolate the weak, and overwhelm them, drain them of energy and hack them down. None of the samurai kill their opponents in dramatic set pieces - but the movie is so well made we don't notice that in fact almost all the bandits are either hacked up by the villagers, or stabbed in the back by the samurai, not killed face to face. This is, in truth, how most battles work. Its not noble, but its far more 'real' than lots of gushing blood and severed limbs.",Seven Samurai

175,evilmatt-3,And this is one of the top films ever . . . why?,2,15 February 2004,"I gave this film a 2/10. It was saved from 1/10 status sheerly by the fact that it *was* an inspiration to so many movies than came after it (and redefined the American Western). The best way to think of this movie, though, is as the Japanese Citizen Kane: classic, original, and vastly overrated. I am sorry to say this about the work of such a great director. I thought Rashômon was amazing. But this . . . Well . . . Not.First and foremost, the film cannot justify its almost comically absurd length. I don't shy away from long movies as long as there are sufficient plot and character development to keep me interested. The plot here is so straightforward it's kind of embarassing. The characters themselves are little more than paper cutouts with little no emotional lives whatsoever. I challenge ANYBODY reading this to find me one person who was actually moved by the Shino love subplot, or the subplot where Mifune's character is exposed as the son of a farmer. Nobody cares, but why should we? None of this has any impact on the story anyhow. In fact, the ""personal"" sequences of the film serve as little else besides filler between action sequences.I couldn't even get behind the few characters that actually were given breathing space in the film: the villagers. They were all whiny, crotchety, needy, and generally a pain in the arse for 3 hours. While this is indeed a theme of the film, it's frustrating because I need SOMEONE to sympathize with here, if for no other reason that to relieve the mind numbing boredom this film induces.Technically, this film is great, but it has no soul. Thus, all the technique goes to waste. I'm happy this was made because there are so many works derivative of it that I love (especially King's Dark Tower novels). But I have *no* desire to ever see this again, and I would advise anyone else considering it to stay away.",Seven Samurai
176,Naoufel_B,A three hour epic of pure entertainment.,9,18 August 2021,"""Seven Samurai"" is a true monument of the seventh art.With this oeuvre Kurosawa reveals a narrative filled with emotional density, richness and intense depth, with most of the humorous lines delivered at the right moment. He also tried to cover the most important themes to the Japanese culture, the senses of honor and duty, respect for traditions, and the values of solidarity. The mise en scène and cinematography are spectacular and extremely precise, expertly mixing lyricism with symbolism. The very high quality of the music and the perfect acting performances (special mention to Toshiro Mifune) only added more to the pleasure to this eternal film.",Seven Samurai
177,madbandit20002000,"With Seven, You Get a Masterpiece",10,12 March 2008,"Growing up, I thought of Japan as the home of anime and giant monster films. Then, while attending college, I saw ""The Seven Samurai"". I was proved wrong by this film, which is considered to be the magnum opus of celebrated filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa, by movie historians. They're right.1587 is the year in Japan and the story's setting. Previously, the nation was ruled by a shogunate (the shogun being the Imperial Army's commander) with the emperor reduced to powerless figurehead. However, unavoidable civil wars came, caused by ambitious daimyo (local warlords), who wanted power, no matter what.In this epic tale (co-written by Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, all who worked Kurosawa's ""Ikiru""), a poor, humble farming village and its' residents are constant victims of a bandit clan. Rice and sex are the group's goals, and they break carelessly the villagers' spirits. What to do? The local authorities are inept, and suicide, for a farmer, is giving up.""We hire samurai,"" the village elder strongly suggests. A quartet of farmers, with a pillar of rice as payment, does that, employing seven individualistic but noble ronin (samurai without masters). There's Kambei (Takashi Shimura of the original ""Godzilla"" and other Kurosawa works), the valiant leader; Gorobei (Yoshio Inaba), a good second-in-command; Shichiroji (Daisuke Kato), a battlefield acquaintance of Kambei; Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki), an optimist; Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi), a perfect killing machine; Katsushiro (Isao Kimura), a green, wet-eared boy and the unforgettable Kikuchiyo (famed Kurosawa player Toshiro Mifune), a wild dog yet perfectly human goofball. Together, they're a force of nature, bounded by courage, honor and self-sacrifice.If you don't like a foreign, subtitled, black and white, three hours and twenty seven minute film, which ""Samurai"" is (and more), you need to be committed at once, post haste (I also adored ""Grindhouse"", which is sixteen minutes less). Under Kurosawa's direction, the film has a jackrabbit's pulse, a wolf's ferocity and a lamb's serenity. It's fascinating that both camps (samurai and farmer) learn from each other while fighting the enemy. Even two reps, despite their social standing (born in a role, die in a role) fall in love; the passion between Katsushiro and Shino (Keiro Tsushima), a young woman whose fool father has cut part of her hair to ""protect her from the samurai"", is subtlety passionate.As the resident clown, Mifune's so idiosyncratically human, he's almost American, being no surprise that he influenced Clint Eastwood (The Man With No Name trilogy) and the late John Belushi (the samurai skits on ""Saturday Night Live""; the Bluto role on ""Animal House""). The battle scenes are fierce and kinetic; it's hard to distinguish whether this work is real or fiction, and that's what makes ""Samurai"" brilliant. The actors, besides Mifune, are great too, honest in their emotions.What more praise can I deemed upon ""Samurai"", other than its' director has influenced the likes of Leone, Peckinpah, Scorcese, Lucas, Rodriguez, Miller, Tarantino, Cannell and others? It's just damn cool. The American western remake, ""The Magnificent Seven"", is reliable but comes short, if compared to ""Samurai"", being star-studded and Hollywood polished. Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" is a better, if unofficial, remake.If you buy the three-disc DVD from Criterion (expensive but worth it), you'll be forever enchanted. Give some honor to ""The Seven Samurai"", and enjoy.",Seven Samurai

179,Wulfstan10,A Masterpiece,10,1 April 2005,"This film is thoroughly successful on many levels.On the one hand, it is an action-oriented film about a village hiring seven samurai to defend them against marauding bandits and there is a lot of fighting in the film. Most of this, logically, is in the portion of the film where the village and samurai are fighting off the bandits and this lasts quite a long time, going through several phases/days, and involving a number of different fights.However, the film is much deeper and more intricate than a simple action/fighting film, and is truly a compelling drama. Much effort goes into developing a number of distinct, rich characters very different from each other and many with a lot of issues. The samurai are all very different in personalities, specific motivations, etc. and this is demonstrated quite thoroughly and convincingly. Some in particular have significant emotional issues they are trying to resolve, some of which only become clear over time. The same is true for a number of the villagers. All of this is handled very well and in a way that truly adds to the film's power and richness.Moreover, it is not a simple, clear-cut good-vs-bad film. Over time, it becomes clear that the villagers are not the totally innocent, destitute victims they at first appear or claim to be. For a while, some samurai even start to doubt that they should even protect the villagers. Some villagers in particular are rather unpleasant, greedy, or vindictive. This element also is handled very well and is a fascinating detail that really adds to the film's strength, the ultimate meaning of the conclusion, the tension, and how convincing it is.This adds to the impact of the conclusion, which is neither fully happy nor sad. The end result is complex, like the rest of the film.Finally, the acting and cinematography, etc., are all very good. The development of the plot, scenes of the village, character portrayal, etc. firmly convey the complex issues and characters in the film. I particularly like the effects, such as the dust, etc., used to show how poor the farmers are (or appear) and how rough their life is when they must deal with the bandits, and how this changes a bit by the end.Ultimately, this film is rich and complex as well as exciting. The result is very convincing and compelling.",Seven Samurai
180,SmileyMcGrouchpants,Everyone should see this movie!,10,30 April 2020,"Coming around to this picture at 48 (there's a lot of catching up to do; I still having seen ""Serpico!""), I was impressed with how long ago this was made (1954) and with what care and attention to detail. Like so many masters, Kurosawa registers as one you have to feel slavish about and if you haven't seen enough of them in a barrage to almost become a filmmaker yourself, chances are there's plenty of this classic kicking around to catch up with if you've got plenty of time on your hands (as we find ourself these days!). Compelling, with both a gritty and epic feel as well as a grasp of class details of everyday life in this far-away time, this movie is wiling to follow every digression as though it was equally important -- as any military tactician can tell you, the key to success in everything from walking the perimeter to not forgetting intangibles and being willing to harbor any potential outcome as a possibilities. Frankly, this movie is as good for the kids as for the adults, because they're learning a lot of crap these days, and this picture puts you in a place where a lot of human life spills over -- including those in the film who do or don't value it, and what that means. View it with the ""Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" picture, one I liked but not quite as much, because, hey, you've got 6 hours to sit around, right? ""And he goes as if for a mushroom hunt ...

182,Ripe Peach,Well worth revisiting,10,18 January 2001,"I'm currently going through a bit of an anti-Hollywood period, being just sick to the back teeth of the likes of Tom ""Earnest"" Hanks and Adam ""Dribbling Idiot"" Sandler substituting mugging and grimacing for acting, and directors using loud bangs and look-at-meeeeeee effects in lieu of actually bothering to try and involve the viewer in the film.So, fresh from the astonishing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I decided to give ""7 Samurai"" (English subtitle version) another viewing, and was not disappointed.  Samurai is a simple film; the characters are quickly established, the plot is small scale, the dialog is realistic but fairly terse, and the shots are clear rather than overtly clever.  But in this case, the simplicity is most definitely a virtue, and it hides a painstaking process.  Kurosawa decides precisely what he wants to shoot, and then shoots it precisely as he wants it.  The result is a gripping film in which the heroism of the samurai is all the more involving because there is a real sense of their humanity and mortality.  There are few surprises in the outcome, but Kurosawa makes us actually care about the journey as much as, or even more than, the destination.Compare with Tarantino, and contrast with the standard Hollywood style of a eight or nine showcase events leading linearly to a neat conclusion, with the ""talky bits"" squeezed in in a seemingly ad hoc fashion.  Such blockbusters can be fun, but they are ultimately uninvolving; Samurai leaves images in your mind that will last a lifetime.",Seven Samurai
183,KIDOLOHKEN,What is the difference between seven Samurais and Magnificent seven?,10,7 November 2019,"I think that whether there was class system or no class system.
In Japanese Civil War era there was severe class system. No farm laborer come to the idea that they hire samurai. That is the idea of upside down. So that, it is a great idea. We, screenplay writers can learn from this movie that the first hint of idea is the most important fact to write a great story. If you get this idea, you can write Seven samurais or Magnificent seven.
And the great screenplay of Seven samurai made the movie looks like real. I think this movie is very real. Just like it's taken in 400 years ago. There are no great movie like this which is showing more than 200 years ago so realistic.

184,gentendo,Mis-en-Scene,8,26 January 2008,"Filmmaker's Purpose Kurosawa seeks to examine the following messages: How God answers earnest prayers, takes mercy on his children as a result of their suffering, and provides strength for them to overcome their challenges.In the beginning, a village of distressed farmers is shown mourning in solemn prayer. They cry to the heavens, asking if there is a God who cares about them, and if so, why he would allow them to suffer as much as they were (i.e. land tax, forced labor, disease, starvation, and war). Just when they are about to lose hope, the village patriarch becomes inspired to hire a band of samurai to protect them from a group of bandits who keep pillaging their land. To heighten this inspiration as direct revelation from God, there is a specific production design element known via mis-en-scene that helps draw the conclusion that the patriarch is acting under the influence of God's spirit.To explain, the patriarch represents the village's wisdomthe god-like figure. He is old, gray, mature, and lives inside of a sawmill. The mis-en-scene regards the sawmill in particular. A sawmill's purpose is to power the mill through collecting water from a nearby stream and in turn grind grain. In short, it is an empowerment tool that is enabled through natural means to sustain and feed a people. So to, then, the patriarch is also an empowerment tool used in the hands of God to enlighten the village on how to protect themselves from the banditshire samurai! It is in this way that the villagers are sustained and protected temporally.To conclude, it is in consequence of their suffering that God has taken mercy upon the small village. He answers their prayers (through revelation) by providing the necessary strength (samurai) for them to overcome their challenges (the bandits).Character Arc I'd like to focus on the villagers as a collection of personages as the lead character of this film. In the beginning, they are severely lamenting due to their afflictions (i.e. list above). There are those who complain because of their circumstances and those who do not. Contention exists amongst the people as a natural consequence of them fearing death. It is the fear of death that must be overcome in order for the villagers to experience a rebirtha new hope for life and peace. Just as all hope is about to be lost, the village patriarch becomes inspired to hire samurai to protect them from their enemies.Through this revelation, the villagers work as though everything depended upon them as they venture out into the world to search for trained samurai; in particular, hungry trained samurai. It is only when they unify themselves together as a body of desperate souls that they discover their will to live. When they find all seven samurai, they both rejoice and fear simultaneously; rejoice because they feel protected from their enemies; fearful because they are afraid of their saviors. In a way, it is as if God himself has come to protect them. Their natural instinct, though, is to fear God due to their unworthiness. Though the samurai are at first welcomed as plagues, they are later worshipped as gods.There are two beautiful moments shown by contrast that help demonstrate the villagers will to overcome death. The first is shown between the two village men who argue over losing the rice which would otherwise feed the samurai. A delicate shot is shown of the older man picking up what few kernels of rice there are to be salvaged from off the ground. It is symbolic of their desire to live despite what meager circumstances they are under. The second is of the samurais training the villagers to unite unselfishly together to battle the bandits. Even the women and children are taught to defend themselves. This sequence demonstrates the unity to overcome death, for it is said by one samurai, ""Individuals will die, but groups will survive!"" In essence, they are training the villagers to hold together during their times of struggle.After defeating the bandits and surviving death (for the most part), the villagers are reborn with an attitude of jubilation and hope. They are seen plowing in their fields singing and dancing as the remaining samurai who trained them look onwards.",Seven Samurai

188,varundelpiero,One for the ages...,9,23 October 2008,"I've long heard of Akira Kurosawa's legendary status, but this is actually my first foray into his world. Upon first viewing SEVEN SAMURAI I have to agree with many by saying that Kurosawa is simply a masterful storyteller.First off, let's clear the air here: the picture is in black-and-white and it's not very 'stylish' by today's standards. It is for these reasons that many people seem to pass this movie over. However, after seeing it for myself, I must say that those aforementioned reasons should serve as NO deterrent to film enthusiasts anywhere.The story itself is brilliant in its simplicity. There are three well-known main parts to the movie, namely the search, the training and preparation, and the standoff. The movie itself is about 210 minutes long, which allows Kurosawa to fully develop three of the samurai to the point where the viewer begins to care rather deeply for them. One of the other samurai is somewhat 'half-developed', while the other three are relatively under-developed, but still possess more character than many of the so-called stars of today's 'blockbusters'.I'll admit, 210 minutes is quite a long time to watch a movie. The film even has an intermission (about 5 minutes long) after the first 130 minutes or so, but the intermission itself serves as a nuisance rather than a relief. Reason being: this movie is extremely engrossing, and the time just flies by.The samurai themselves cannot be seen as generic hero types, but possess an array of 'anti-heroic' qualities. Indeed, most (if not all) of the samurai have some sort of character or personality flaw that allows the viewer to relate to them more.Many of the scenes in this film consist of epic, ground-breaking (at that time) shots. The battles are well-thought and very well-choreographed. The strategies used by both parties are intelligent and genuine. I especially liked the way that Kurosawa attempts to capture all seven samurai in the same shot, and this is evident in the epic final scene.This movie is definitely one for the ages, and belongs up there with the likes of CITIZEN KANE. As evidenced by literature, it would seem that fine storytelling indeed withstands the test of time. This film is a true classic in very sense. A fine and epic motion picture.It is difficult to give this film 4 stars (out of 4) simply because I can't recommend it to everyone. I believe that many viewers will find the movie boring and unappealing. Regardless, I believe that this film should be seen at least once, and as such deserves the highest accolade.4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Should enter my top 100 at 85 or so. Strongly recommended.",Seven Samurai

But, the actual film doesn't hold up as well as I'd hoped. It is an action movie. I'm sure that meant something much different when it was released than it does now. Action movies have since worked off of the same tropes movies like Seven Samurai invented and as a result often come off as stale. It's not through any fault of its own but the film is lacking and its because the genre and the narrative style has been beaten into the ground since it's release.

Wherever I go, nothing but praises have been bestowed upon this film.  I have seen it several times since I first saw it a few years ago, and a friend of mine who normally avoids subtitled films have changed his opinion after he saw it.Be prepared to get attached to the film's main characters because they are really cool, like Kyuzo's steel-cold attitude and Kikuchiyo's bravery as well as hilarious antics (played to perfection by Toshiro Mifune).Seven Samurai is Kurosawa's legacy that has changed American filmmaking forever.  There's a good reason why many American film makers are heavily influenced by this movie, and countless clones have been made (like Magnificent Seven) but none of them were even close to Kurosawa's original.",Seven Samurai
192,redtiago,Intemporal masterpiece,9,2 January 2021,"It is not the best film by Master Akiro Kurosawa but it is the most influential. And one of his masterpieces. I saw it again today, it is timeless, it makes as much sense when it was done, as it is today. This is achieved only by great works. It were maiden an American version ""the magnificent seven"" in nowadays is also a classic movie. Version approved by Kurosawa who offered a Japanese sword to the director in recognition.
I strongly recommend it is a timeless masterpiece.",Seven Samurai
193,Asentiff2004,Seven Samurai to save us....,8,26 January 2014,"A village of poor farmers becomes assailed by a group of merciless bandits, only to end up hiring a group of seven Ronin, samurai to protect them.A classic film that has gone on to inspire another classic film, the Magnificent Seven. This film though aged in its presentation still holds up to the test of time with its compelling acting and story. The pacing though somewhat disjointed can be difficult to follow for first time viewers but eventually the compelling heart and tremendous acting of this film will win out. The plot is engaging, the acting is fantastic as is the authenticity of the film in which the time frame it takes place in. Kurosawa, proves why he is one of the most esteemed directors to ever grace a silver screen. Though this film was released in the mid 50's it is still to this day considered a must see for any fan of cinema, one in which this viewer highly recommends. The culture of feudal Japan is well represented and the chemistry between the seven principal characters carries the film as does there highly evolved and celebrated differences that Kurosawa so easily brings to the forefront of the film. Action, drama, and even a bit of comedy help make this film one of the finest to ever be made.",Seven Samurai

In my view, that should never be a barrier for a true film lover. The BFI Blu-Ray is presented in either two parts (as it would have been in cinemas, I presume) or in full without the intermission - so, no excuses 😏 watch it!There are many other Akira Kurosawa masterpieces to watch - I am working way through them at present - here are my favourites just now: Drunken Angel, Stray Dog, Rashomon, Throne Of Blood (Macbeth), The Hidden Fortress, The Bad Sleep Well, Yojimbo & Sanjuro, High and Low, Kagemusha, Ran.

I mean it will be much better a japanese story movie remade by the japanese too.,Seven Samurai
196,FANatic-10,"Kurosawa, the Master",10,8 August 2001,"One of the most influential films ever made, and still great almost 50 years after its premiere.  Seven Samurai is such a rich film, in so many ways, that a simple description really can't do it justice.  The photography and editing are utterly magnificent, every scene beautifully composed and lit. If you want to know what makes a film artful, just compare this film and every other merely proficient action film - you can see it immediately.Kurosawa gives each character detail and life, making them real and complex, even the smallest roles.  And there's not a subpar performance in the lot. I admit I found Toshiro Mifune a bit excessive at first as the animalistic, buffoonish Kikuchiyo, but the character gains in power as the film proceeds, and there's no denying Mifune's incredible physicality and intensity.  His famous monologue about farmers, delivered with helmet askew, is stunning - extraordinary acting.The famed battle scenes at the end are unforgettably harsh and noisy and dirty.  What's really amazing is that no stunt men were used, but real arrows were!  I love the kineticism of the scenes, shot using Kurosawa's famous 3 camera technique.  In all the scenes of people running, the camera seems to speed up also to kick up the film's adrenaline.  Kurosawa also memorably pioneered the use of slow motion in some scenes to underscore the moment brilliantly.  He does an amazing job of orchestrating the flow of the action throughout.  I also loved the scene with Rykichi's wife - Kurosawa takes less than a minute's worth of screen time to produce one of the most eloquent and eerie bits of silent acting since the days of Lillian Gish.Lyrical, rough, hilarious, heartbreaking, eloquent - I could supply an endless stream of adjectives.  This is just a film everyone who cares about movies should see.  The only time I mind a movie's length is when its a bad movie - this is possibly the best movie ever made, and every minute you spend watching it is well worth it!",Seven Samurai
197,maitreg,Long but good,7,16 March 2001,"Very long.  They could have cut out about 1.5 hours and the movie would have been just as effective.  It is an excellent portrayal of the harshness the Japanese people lived through for centuries.  This movie teaches lots of lessons, the most important being how strong a family and village bond can be.The entire country is in the middle of an economic catastrophe.  A small rice-farming village is constantly attacked by bandits who steal all their food and leave them to die.  In a final effort to save their village and their lives, they seek out samurai to protect them.  When they convince a samurai that their cause is worth fighting for, he assembles a team of warriors to plan a defense for the town against the bandits.Another DVD that seriously needs English dubbing.  Sub-titles give me headaches, especially when they go on for over three hours.  Great film though, even if you have to watch it over three sittings.",Seven Samurai

199,Rifat_Rock_Don,Best Japanese Movie Ever,10,30 April 2020,"In 1954, Kurosawa made foreign film history with Seven Samurai. Everything about this film is just absolutely terrific. The film lasts around 3 1/2 hours, and every minute of it is unbelievable filmmaking. Kurosawa's blend of stellar craft, captivating cinematography, ravishing art direction, and unforgettable characters makes this one of the most intelligent films ever made. The first hour is devoted to devoloping the many four-dimensional characters which inhabit the film throughout. W hen watching the film, the audiece cares for, trusts, mourns and ultimately believes every single attribute the characters have. Samurai set up the way that many action films are made today; fil ms like Predator and Alien still work within it's boundaries. The battle scenes are terrific and the fast-paced editing is ground-breaking. If people have a problem with subtitles and long movies, then see this and your opinions will change. The sheer filmmaking of Kurosawa will not disappoint. Also see Yojimbo and High & Low.",Seven Samurai

A long sigh to cover my eyes, lamenting the difficulties of the people's livelihood, lamenting the poor nature of its farmers -- cowardice, suspicion, selfishness, looseness, lack of ideas, and adherence to the rules; However, sad but not surprising, the history of the past, the trend of the situation, can only hope for the future, the peasant class can rise!",Seven Samurai
201,anthony_retford,Why Attack a Defended Village?,10,5 December 2009,"I really like this movie and have seen it several times, but each time I have to question why the bandits would attack a defended village. They had pillaged it before an unknown number of times and each time would have just ridden in and taken what they wanted. This time was radically different. Gone were the straightforward accesses and in place were flooded areas, stout fences, and Samauri. I would have to say the bandit leader was lacking in marbles. Why not just ride on to the next village and plunder that one? Why engage a formidable enemy and risk losing any men at all? At any rate had I been a rider I would have ridden the other way once the fighting began and not stick with an idiot who called himself the leader.",Seven Samurai
202,JohnLennon1985,The Mother of all Modern Action Movies,10,10 October 2002,"At first, I didn't know what to think. I've been watching anime in subtitles for quite some time now, but a whole movie? OVER THREE HOURS? Perish the thought, right? Wrong. This was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.I quickly became attached to the characters. In Japan, the acting just seems to be more authentic. I forgot the movie was in subtitles halfway through, because you can almost see what they're trying to say simply by listening to them (of course, I DID read the subtitles, but I barely noticed).The action sequences were years ahead of their time. Fight scenes like that are almost unheard of in the 50s. The entire final battle lasts an hour, but time does not exist while you watch it. It seemed more like 20 minutes.
I have never heard of this movie before. I was apathetic to the movie while I watched it. This movie is why I watch movies that I have no particular interest in watching. This is one of my all-time favorites, and it rightfully deserves its place on the IMDb top 250.",Seven Samurai
203,barkingechoacrosswaves,"Quite good, but overrated",7,10 February 2010,"Seven Samurai has acquired a legendary reputation among moviegoers, and is routinely called one of the top films in cinema history. I certainly appreciated Seven Samurai, but I think the praise that has been lavished on it is overdone. Apart from some creaky sentimentality and a fairly urgent need for sharper editing, there is nothing specially wrong with the movie. It is a fine blend of drama and comedy with good performances all around and an engaging story, and well shot to boot. Mifune is quite hammy in this picture, though, and that does get annoying at times.Seven Samurai is not as good as Kurosawa's own Yojimbo, which is much tighter, much more restrained in its approach to sentiment and much funnier. Perhaps most importantly, Mifune is not a character actor in Yojimbo but rather a much more ""natural"" character with an intriguing blend of dignity and earthiness, greed and generosity.If you are craving a really good samurai movie by Kurosawa and can see only one, Yojimbo is the obvious choice over Seven Samurai.",Seven Samurai
204,dragonshield,"Requires concentration and real nerves, but in the end it'll all be worth it",9,28 June 2007,"Like probably everyone else who haven't seen this movie, I also had huge expectations on it. This is one of those movies which I was ashamed of not seeing, as it's still a classic in the history of motion pictures and the one of Akira Kurosawa's films that is described as ""a must-see"" for every movie freak there is. Having an 8.8/10 rating and standing on the mighty 9th place at IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time -list it's pretty hard to watch it without having those huge expectations. The movie tells a story about a village which is constantly attacked and robbed by bandits. The village's eldest wise man suggests that the villagers should hire samurais, respected warriors, to defend the village, so some of the villagers leave their home to find samurais for the job. It doesn't take so much time until they find the ones, and these samurais form the group of the seven samurais, who each have their own personalities and ways of interacting.First of all, you really have to relate to the time when the movie was produced. It's nothing near the movies these days, it's completely different, obviously. I've watched a lot of Japanese movies in the past and this is no exception when it comes to this certain style of this specific tension seen from the screen. I wouldn't say it's boring, but it's somehow tedious. I mean, the movie requires this certain mood for the viewer, so you can't really watch it like any other film. The tempo is slow and sometimes the scenes seem like they're too lengthened, which needs a lot of concentration and nerves, yet it's all worth it after all. The tempo of ""Shichinin no samurai"" has this nice way of speeding up towards the end, so it gets faster and faster all the time, though there are some of those slow scenes between. I can't really describe those scenes in any other way than ""slow"", as it's really hard to explain it after all. Over three hours of one movie is always pretty heavy, no matter what the movie itself was. This is a heavy movie, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be worth watching. The music is these dark and gloomy orchestrations, which really fit in the main theme of the movie so well and though it doesn't include relaxed or soothing compositions it still is overall a great experience, composed by Fumio Hayasaka it builds up tension in a flowing way and it's sort of adapted in the exactly right places. It definitely has that 50's feel to it, but it's still original.One thing that immediately crosses your mind when the movie progresses itself is how incredibly well it's made considering when it is actually made. If you look at the 50's, there weren't any computers so CGI was obviously out of question. This basically means that everything you see on the screen is actually the real deal, everything that moves actually moves and everything that happens actually happens. This is what you have to pay attention to when you're watching the movie, as then you finally realise why it truly was such a big hit back then and why it immediately formed itself as a classic. A born legend some could say. The cinematography compliments the whole credibility the film offers for the viewer. It is a little bit different than Japanese cinematography nowadays, but there's still that same feeling and emotion. To me as a fan of Japanese cinematography ""Shichinin no samurai"" didn't disappoint me; Wide endless landscapes, those beautiful boundless hills and lands, it's honestly always a treat for you. Japanese also tend to use so much more still shots than any other nation and that is one of the things that form that certain well-known feeling and emotion.When you really relate to the time the directing doesn't disappoint you either. It's no wonder people have been buzzing about this film for ages as it is indeed Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, a real specimen of skill. The thing that surprised me though was that the role performances can actually be compared to role performances these days, in Japanese films that is. The acting in this movie still has that certain anger, that somehow believable incredibility, that Japanese original way of acting, which also can not be compared to any other nation. Japanese films live in their own time and hopefully that'll always be the case, as when you're bored of Hollywood you can always change to a different perspective; The Japanese perspective.""Shichinin no samurai"" is timeless. It doesn't matter if you'd watch it even after 100 years from its release, it's a movie everyone should see, though it does require certain age from the viewer. This is not a movie for children after all as it's pretty violent too. Having huge expectations on a movie always gets me so stressed and to be really honest I thought the movie would have been better. But as a person in my 20's what can you really expect from a movie made in the 50's? It's like eating the same cereals years after years and then suddenly changing to porridge with sugar and milk in it. It's like drinking a long drink and then changing to whiskey. The difference gap is just so huge. ""Shichinin no samurai"" is a brilliant film if you can relate to the time, though it is pretty long-winded it does get better after a few days when you've seen it. You don't really ""get it"" at first, but just give yourself some time to repeat the events occurred in the movie and soon you see yourself perceiving the whole meaning of the movie, what's it all about and what it tries to tell you, the whole purpose of it. Magnificent indeed.",Seven Samurai
205,paultreloar75,Collective defence,10,10 April 2016,"The Rio Cinema in Dalston showed Seven Samurai this afternoon on original 35mm full-length viewing. Have to say, I found it utterly brilliant, really enjoyable sense of mischief to the whole affair. The story line unfolds quite straightforwardly but the way little bits of plot detail are smuggled in are lovely. You like some people more than others, you laugh at some things and wince elsewhere, and the final battle is a muddy onslaught of victory and death.I absolutely loved it. People behind us said ""thought it was a bit slow"" during intermission. I think they might have been a bit slow myself. Wonderful movie full of invention and enthusiasm and inspiration and imagination.this is a rule of war collective defence protects the individual individual defence destroys the individual",Seven Samurai
206,Sisiutil,A classic that improves with each viewing,9,3 January 2002,"The Seven Samurai is a film so rich that, like the greatest poetry, it takes more than one viewing to mine its depths. At first glance, it's a deceptively simple action film set in feudal Japan. The plot concerns some peasants, whose village is threatened by bandits, engaging some warriors to protect them.But repeated viewings reveal great depths to this film. It raises questions about class relations, militarism, and the wages of violence. I also don't think it's stretching it to see veiled references to Japan's post-war reconstruction and relations with the West. (It can't be a coincidence that all the Sumurai who die are killed by guns--a super-weapon imported from the West--rather than by swords.) Rewatching The Seven Samurai also allows you to appreciate its masterful, dynamic cinematography--which still compares favourably to current Hollywood action films.Modern audiences may find the initial pacing slower than they're used to--but Kurosawa never wastes a shot, and everything's in there for a reason. Many of those reasons only become clear later in the film, and repeated viewings allow you to enjoy the skilled set-up that much more.

If you want to see some action you'll have to wait towards the last hour of the film. There is a beautiful build up to the action, which is previewed by good character build up and preparation for a battle. Now, let me say something about the films length. Since it's an Epic it has to be a long film. That's a rule in cinema. However, a good epic will manage to leave you at the end of the film with the feeling that the minutes just flew away, otherwise, you weren't ""in"" the movie. This is what I felt with ""The Seven Samurai"". This movie is an historic film, as it deals with the Fuedal society of Japan in the 16th Century. The last scene with the four dead Samurai, and the three Samurai who are left, is an amazing ending.[9/10]",Seven Samurai
209,Teyss,Not just an action movie: an elaborate composition,10,6 October 2016,"""Seven Samourai"" has become a reference in action genre, but is much more: a finely crafted, multi-level masterpiece. Because there have already been many analyses on different aspects of this movie, the following review will focus on just one of them: how apparently simple features are actually very elaborate.THEATRICAL ACTINGThe exaggerated play of some actors can be disconcerting. We know upfront how characters feel: emotions precede action, not the opposite. Kurosawa pays tribute to Japanese traditional theatre (kabuki), where acting and makeup can be very expressive.To put this expressiveness into perspective, Kurosawa frequently introduces representations, where a crowd watches an important event, precisely as in a theatre:
Kambei kills the child kidnapper.Kyuzo defeats a samurai in duel.Kikuchiyo mounts a horse.Women see the final battle from inside.Repeatedly, farmers and samurais watch the bandits, who watch them.Additionally, characters constantly gaze at each other: it seems one is playing a role, looking at others playing theirs and checking how others look how one is playing it.
Kambei and Kikuchiyo intensely stare at each other the first time they meet.Katsushiro looks at everybody.Three samurais watch the bandits inside their lair.Kikuchiyo gawks at women.Kyuzo sees the two lovers under the rain.VARIED CHARACTERSIf there is a central character, it is the crazy Kikuchiyo.
On the surface, he appears to be a simple comic relief. However he represents the link between the three opposed environments: he is at the same time a samurai and a former farmer, and we feel he could have turned into a bandit under different circumstances.He performs key actions: he drives the farmers out of their homes by ringing the alarm; he discovers the hidden samurai armoury; he makes a convincing speech on farmers and samurais; he plants the sword on top of Heihachi's grave (a figure that will be repeated, and that composes the last frame of the movie); he steals a musket; he defeats the bandit chief who uses a musket and thus could have killed other samurais.Hence Kikuchiyo is more complex than he originally seems. The scene when he hugs the abandoned baby and admits he lived the same fate, is gripping. Kikuchiyo embodies instinct and as such is opposed to Kambei, the mind (a frequent theme in Kurosawa's films).Characters are archetypal: samurais each have a distinct feature; farmers are immediately recognisable. In contrast, bandits are an anonymous, irresistible force: Kurosawa was inspired by Westerns of the period. Interestingly, his film in turn influenced numerous Westerns and other movies (see its Connections section on IMDb).INDIVIDUAL & COLLECTIVE HISTORY""Seven Samurai"" depicts medieval Japan, with its harsh conditions, social classes and their contrasting codes: samurais, farmers, city dwellers, bandits. As said, everybody fulfills their roles. Conflicts between these classes abound, but also within each: samurais (Kikuchiyo versus Kambei), farmers (many arguments), bandits (two deserters get shot).We feel this world is changing. The grand samurai tradition, notably, is fading.
All samurais except Kikuchiyo are based on historical persons.They always show high moral standards, challenged by the bandits and the farmers (cowardice, treachery). When the samurais want to spare the prisoner according to their ethics, the old woman and the village chief (experience and wisdom) override their decision.Samurais have a strong fighting etiquette, of which sabre is the emblem. Revealingly, all four samurais are killed not by a traditional weapon, but by a gunshot: technology is changing the spirit of warfare. In a stupefying yet logical move, Kyuzo, the perfect professional, throws his sabre angrily just before dying.Eventually ""The farmers have won, not us"", Kambei bitterly admits. Honour, courage and solidarity had their purpose, now is time for production, abundance and life. Farmers sing when they plant the rice; it is sunny as it previously was when they harvested it: they represent future and hope.TAILORED STYLEKurosawa remarkably adapts style to the action. Just two examples.1. The love story between Katsushiro and Shino unfolds progressively to offset tension and provides ravishing scenes: with limited length and dialogues, Kurosawa beautifies their feelings.The first scene is a jewel. It starts as a bright dream where four of the five senses are fulfilled: Katsushiro sees white flowers and moving leaves (subjective shot); he hears the flowing stream; he smells the flowers; he feels them under his back. Desire (Shino) barges into Katsushiro's juvenile environment: he will then become a man. In the following chase, they go down a dark hill: an opposition emerges between the delightful flowers and music (pure emotions) versus the dark, low, entangled branches (lust, social taboo).They meet again amid the flowers, then under the rain, and finally at night among fires: while their first meetings were under the sign of water (stream, rain), the night they make love is under the sign of fire (superb shots of flame reflections over their bodies). All these scenes are gems sprinkled in the movie.2. The final climatic battle is a tour-de-force, ground-breaking for the period and never equalled since. It is raining hard. Fighters move heavily, fall, crawl, make pathetic movements to save their lives. They are drenched, frightened, exhausted, covered with mud. Bandits make a disgusting sound when they die. Editing is convulsive, images are confusing: we have trouble understanding what is happening, just as the fighters themselves. It is total chaos. This realism is very far from the heroic fights of Curtiz or the choreographed ultra-violence of Peckinpah and Tarantino. There is no better demonstration that war is dreadful.Last, the score admirably illustrates the story. Each character type has a musical theme: samurais, farmers, women, elderly, bandits. An idea that has since been used in various films.The movie lasts for 3h30 but at no moment feels long. Action, epic, emotions, values, harshness, humour, beauty: it has it all.",Seven Samurai
210,alexsnower,One of the best you will ever see,10,25 June 2021,This movie is perfect down to every tiny detail. The plot perfectly unfolds around a town of people harassed and forced to the brink of starvation by ruthless thieves. They venture off and find a samurai who recruit a friend and 5 other men to help him. One of the men joins without permission at first but is eventually accepted. His name is Kikuchyo. This slightly comedic role played by Toshiro Mifune who transcends the character as one of the most hilarious and sympathetic I have ever seen. He is a class clown but also wants to prove he is a hero. I won't spoil anymore about him but his heroics go above and beyond what you expect of him. The other youngling Katsushiro is essentially the lead samauri's apprentice. He also has romantic interest in a local young woman. This love story doesn't make the movie of course but it's a good side story in between battles. The battle scenes (particularly the final scene) are directed to perfection looking so real you can't believe it. This movie is one of the few 3 hour movies that you can watch over and over without being bored.,Seven Samurai
211,rjyelverton,The Action Movie,10,15 December 2008,"The story at the center of Seven Samurai has been told many times since the film's release: a small village continually hounded by evil bandits sends men to the City to hire defenders. The defenders will seem to be not up to the task and the villagers will learn to find strength within themselves. The story has been repeated in The Magnificent Seven, a remake of this film, The Three Amigos, and A Bug's Life to name a few favorites. It's a strong core story and works because the looming threat of the bandits' return and the questionable strength of the defenders make for surefire suspense.Samurai examines a rigid class structure and how conflict can temporarily throw this structure out of alignment. The Samurai, the honored warrior class, do not socialize with the relatively low on the totem pole farmers. They serve noble families and are paid well, but an ongoing civil war has destabilized 16th century China and increased the likelihood that there will be samurai looking for work and food. The uncertain times bring the noble mercenaries and lowly farmer temporarily together.Young samurai apprentice Katsushiro will not surprisingly have a romance with the farmer's daughter. We expect as much. They will hide this romance from the girl's father, but not merely because he will disapprove of his daughter's indiscretion, but because it is an insult to the sacrosanct class structure. When the samurai is discovered, is his shame merely that of a man caught in a hidden affair or is it also due to his being caught in a dalliance below his station? Preparation for the coming fight makes up a large portion of the film. Director Kurosawa does an excellent job of laying out the geography of the village as the samurai survey the land they will defend and attempt to discover its weak points. These scenes give the viewer a sense of geography and allow us to participate fully in the film's epic closing battle. We are right in the thick of the action and have a grasp of the strategy taking place.The care taken in preparing the viewer for the battle is refreshing. Modern action film-making more often than not give an impression of tense battle with quick cuts of explosions or swords clashing accompanied by a heroic theme. We understand that chaos is taking place on an epic scope, but have no sense of what exactly is happening. Kurosawa carefully orients the viewer and never loses you in the mayhem. The skirmish at the climax of this film is very small in size, but Kurosawa still manages to create the sense of an epic battle. Forty armored bandits, a few with firearms, will take on about a hundred villagers. But the stakes are high. The villagers if they lose will surely die. They are not trained warriors and there are not nearly enough samurai to defend the village.The final battle is one of the best ever filmed. Deaths are sudden and brutal, but Kurosawa does not linger over them. He rushes us on to the next heated skirmish. The unskilled villagers fight badly, but fight with intense hatred. They swarm in large groups and thrust wildly and clumsily with their makeshift spears. Terrorized for years by the bandits, they act out with great fury when in battle. Cutting between wide shots of the village and close ups of hooves falling and spears thrusting, Kurosawa places us in the midst of the battle. The entire effect is thrilling and frequently disturbing. All of this is accomplished with no visible bloodshed.Kurosawa like Renoir also employs long takes and deep focus to great effect. In early scenes when the villagers are trying to recruit samurai,the director uses a combination of deep focus and forced perspective to underline the villagers' poverty. (Forced perspective is utilized in The Lord of the Rings films to make the actors playing hobbits appear much smaller than others on screen.) The villagers can only pay their potential saviors in rice and their small, but essential, container of rice frequently dwarfs the villagers. Every shot in the film is carefully composed and full of meaning. We wonder at Kurosawa's camera that both serves story, but also moves with grace and agility. He films movement with such urgency and clarity.The film is not only notable for the prowess of Kurosawa's direction, but also for the performances. Toshiro Mifune--the inspiration behind Jon Belushi's choleric Saturday Night Live samurai--first appears to be the film's comic relief. He desires to be a samurai, but lacks the necessary refinement and bearing. But he proves to be a valuable morale booster. As the story continues, Mifune develops a darker side to his character as the reasons for his lack of refinement emerge. Takashi Shimura, playing the samurai leader Kambei Shimada, lends his character the necessary gravity while at the same time providing the film's moral center. He is a great leader, but also a humanitarian willing to work for food in defense of the needy.Seven Samurai is a black and white film and features subtitles which have kept it from reaching a broader audience. It has also been done the honor and disservice of being labeled a masterpiece which lends it the impression of being stuffy and humorless. The film is, however, is an extremely enjoyable and engrossing action film. Some would say it is The Action Film. It is sure to please both the film snob and average viewer.",Seven Samurai

213,Joseph_Gillis,Mud and Rain and Conflict,10,7 April 2000,"This film is undoubtedly Kurosawa's masterpiece (no mean feat when one considers the opposition such as ""Throne of Blood"", ""Ran"" and ""Yojimbo""). The film's story, construction, credible and engaging characters, and that perfect ending are assets that most directors would give their eye teeth for but Kurosawa also proves himself the most economically effective director of action scenes who puts Hollywood directors like Spielberg firmly in his place: the climactic scene where he shows only horses hooves and human legs rushing hither and thither in the mud and torrential rain is most effective in conveying both the ferocity of the conflict and the panic of the villagers, and serves to prove that imagination and invention will always triumph over computer-generated images.",Seven Samurai
214,yellowtail_tuna,Very entertaining Kurosawa's classic.,10,18 October 2020,"In medieval Japan, a village has suffered from the routine robbery of the bandits. In desperate, they resort to hiring samurais to fight against them. At first, it seems hopeless since all they can offer to samurais is food, not money or position. Fortunately, they happen to meet Kambei, an experienced samurai, who sympathizes with them and agrees to help them.Kambei figures out they need to hire seven samurais in total. This recruitment part is quite interesting, introducing each samurai's character. My favorite is Heihachi, who is not skillful as a samurai but is frank and friendly, ""the type of man valuable in such a difficult time"". Soon they succeed to recruit five, largely because of Kambei's respectable personality.In a hurry, they give up the recruitment at only six and set off to the village. But a strange man Kikuchiyo, who claims to be a samurai but apparently not, tags along. He is vulgar and humorous and they gradually feel amused by him. They finally accept him as the seventh samurai.Interestingly, Seven Samurai is not just about heroes protecting people from villains. While badly asking the samurais for help, the villagers show distrust of them. Here we see the class conflict between samurais and peasants. And this is where Kikuchiyo's role becomes significant when the would-be samurai is revealed to be born a peasant. The villagers naturally find him closer than the other samurais. They are gradually getting cooperative in the preparation and training, and finally, the bandits' attack begins.As for the direction, what makes the film powerful is, as other Kurosawa films, the energetic movement. Characters walk and run swiftly, and the camera chases them. The scenes where the crowd frantically moves back and forth are especially impressive. The battle scenes are exciting. It is not a battle of well-organized armed forces but of the quickly assembled samurai team and peasants wielding bamboo spears and the unsophisticated bandits. Most of them are amateurs, and each person of the battle scenes feels his or her own fresh fear or excitement.The screenplay is full of insight, wit, and humor. Characters are simple but charming. The plot is straightforward and compelling. It is a 207 minutes, black and white, and 50s classic film, but you don't have to be intimidated. Seven Samurai is so entertaining that you can easily understand why it is widely seen as one of the best films ever made.",Seven Samurai

216,judemcrobbie,Iconic as you like,8,28 January 2021,"This movie is probably on par with the same amount of stuff influenced with the godfather.The main plot is easy enough to follow, however it has deeper, philosophical meanings:
Comments on the harsh realities of war, through the imagery of burning house.
Racism through the idea of a faction, not from there, trying to fit in.
And a coming of age story for our main protagonist, kikuchiyo.The characters are likeable, funny and charismatic which makes any deaths hard to watch and feel meaningful.The plot is set up beautifully. However, it can be slow to a mind numbing pace. This is easily worked around though as you cannot not concentrate as it's in Japanese.It is quite a tough watch as it has challenging ideas, constant taking in of information, being in Japanese, black and white and the alluded to snail pace at times.There is not a lot of humor however when there is, it's dark and incredibly hilarious.The action scenes are more stylistic than substantive: but all in all, it was 1954 so the ability to shoot incredible action scenes wasn't developed to the extent it is now.The movie creates suspense, tension and fear for the impending doom that is yet to come,The art director is brilliant never losing sight of the 16th century ideals. This helps to immerse you in the movie.Acting and score can fall flat at times, especially when the plot slows. This is because of the storytelling being less focused on.Japan's reply to the western genre hits it out of the park all in all.",Seven Samurai

218,talkymeat,An Absolute Masterpiece.,10,2 June 2010,"A small town of farmers is being threatened by a gang of bandits and the only way they can protect themselves is to hire samurai.Seven Samurai is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word.Akira Kurosawa's direction is a complete delight; he manages to pack so much into every single frame of Seven Samurai's entire 3 1/2 hour run time. Every shot is so cleverly set up that it doesn't really feel like a movie. Kurosawa has a knack for finding every nook and cranny in a room to get angles that make you feel like you are right in the movie.The characters may be the best part of Seven Samurai. Every one of the seven samurai is vibrant, interesting, and emotionally complex. Even after 3+ hours you are left wanting to know more about each of them. Which may be my only complaint about Seven Samurai, but that is a good thing as well. It is much better to finish a movie wanting to see more than wishing there were less.The acting is beyond belief as well. The entire cast manages to squeeze as much as they can out of their character. Toshiro Mifune gives one of the greatest performances of all time as Kikuchiyo and creates a character that you just can't take your eyes off of whenever he is on screen. Mifune's acting goes beyond just how he says his lines or his facial expressions but his every movement is unique and a part of his character. Takashi Shimura's performance as Kanbe Shimada, the defacto leader of the seven, is equally as great or close to it.The sets and costumes make you feel as you have been transported to ancient Japan the action will leave you on the edge of the your seat. The sheer scope Seven Samurai is unparalleled for a movie made in the 50s.I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Seven Samurai and I believe that it is essential viewing for any fan of film. Seven Samurai is a wonder to behold and I am in complete awe ever time I watch it.",Seven Samurai
219,Nothinggrandproductions,An important but overpraised film,7,27 October 2013,"Seven Samurai is a massive, ambitious and influential film that made many common plot elements today what they are. But, does that mean it's actually a great film? In my opinion, no, not so much. A decent one and an important one that everyone should watch but not necessarily a great one. The movie is long. Much too long in my opinion. It's three hours and twenty minutes about, and never does that time seem totally worth it. The characters aren't very compelling which makes me have trouble with actually getting attached to the story itself even if it is interesting. None of the characters for the most part go beyond a surface level of character development which leads me to not caring about a whole lot that is going on. That's not to say the movie is awful.The movie is ambitious and is incredible especially for it's release date, I'm sure almost nothing of it's kind existed beforehand. The movie is massive as I stated before and is filled with many action set pieces that still hold up fairly well today. It is a period piece as well, taking place in 1587 in the Warring States Period of Japan and seems to do a good job portraying samurai which are pretty much cool and interesting by default but that doesn't mean the characters themselves are good. A village of farmers goes to hire samurai to protect them from bandits, they hire a total of seven, if it wasn't obvious enough for the title. The plot is interesting and compelling but again, it doesn't really matter.I don't care about the people in the movie, at least for the most part. And that remains to be my biggest issue. A movie like this needs characters that I at least sort of care about. Probably one of my biggest comparisons to this movie is The Thin Red Line, a Terrence Malick movie which I really like Terrence Malick for the most part. It's a war movie that barely focuses on the characters so I don't really care about anything that is going on. I felt pretty much the same during this movie. Overall, Seven Samurai is still a very important film and a mildly interesting one but that doesn't mean it needs to be held as one of the greatest films of all time like it is, because frankly, it doesn't hold up as well as everyone thinks.",Seven Samurai
220,monsterhunt-94296,Everything you want from a movie,9,13 October 2020,"Alright so today I watched Seven Samurai, probably Kurosawa's most well-known film, and for good reason. If you're thinking about watching this movie, it can be daunting for modern audiences. First off, it's 3 hours and 27 minutes long, secondly it's black and white, and thirdly it has subtitles. This film was not disappointing. It was actually very entertaining, and although there were point where you did feel the run time, for the majority of the film I was thoroughly entertained. There's comedy, there's drama, there's action, this movie has everything you look for in a film. The framing is incredible, the way Kurosawa constantly has something new entering the frame or something exiting the frame is great, the depth showing the size of this world is great, and overall the cinematography just immerses you in the film. All of the characters are done so well, every conversation has so much entertainment value, the characters just bounce off each other so nicely. The acting here is also amazing, I don't think there was a point in the film where I remembered that these are just actors. The story here is honestly pretty simple, but it has a lot of impactful moments and leaves you really satisfied by the end.
Let me talk about the action in this movie for a second, because despite the fact this is a 1954 film, it has some of the best and most intense action I've ever seen. This is due to the fact there's not just explosions everywhere like a modern film would throw at you, but the action dives deep into the strategy behind the battle as each and every enemy killed has huge significance. One thing that I really liked about this movie was how much time was dedicated to character moments and set-up. A modern studio would shred the run time by an hour and shove in more action scenes. This movie doesn't have that much action for the first 2 hours, but all of it is important and all of it is entertaining. The score here is also really good, and I thought it added some nice personality to the film. I honestly just had a really great time watching this movie. I can't think of anything else to say at the moment, so I'll leave it at that. 9/10.",Seven Samurai
221,MundaneNoodle,"Wonderful, if a bit long",10,14 February 2000,"I just saw the 3 1/2 hour version of this film, and it IS a great film. One can see how so many action and western movies have drawn from this. It did get drawn out a bit, and last battle scene was a little too long. However, I enjoyed all of it and who cares if the stabbings looked fake and we never actually saw any blood? The director more than made up for that with RAN. Kurosawa was more interested in a good story than grossing out the viewer with a boatload of Hollywood blood. Why does Hollywood figure that the more gore you show, the more realistic it is? The story is fascinating, although some of the seven samurai characters were underdeveloped. This is what good cinema should be. Make a ovie good story, and everything else will follow. If not, it's still a good story.",Seven Samurai
222,PureCinema,Kurosawa is the greatest director that ever lived,10,26 December 1998,"Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece... The Japanese equivalent to Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.. I say it's just as good, if not even better. Not only Kurosawa's most well known film, but the most widely recognized Japanese film ever made. This movie will forever be known as a milestone in motion picture history.The story revolves around a village that has become a group of bandits' common looting and pillaging ground. The villagers cannot take this any longer and go to town to hire warriors to defend the village from the bandits. A wandering ronin, Kambei (Takashi Shimura) agrees to help them and with his help, they recruit six others that agree to take the job. The seven samurai teach the villagers how to stand up to the bandits and defend themselves. Finally, when the time comes, they engage in a fierce battle with the attacking bandits.About once in every 20 years or so we are gifted with a film that has the meaning, power, richness, and technique that The Seven Samurai has. I cannot urge anyone enough to see this film, the images are true cinematic poetry rich with so much emotion that I cannot even describe them in words. If you have never seen any of Kurosawa's works, then please see Seven Samurai... you will witness the true beauty, excellence and magic that the art form known as film is capable of.",Seven Samurai
223,ThatAnimeSnob,Defending rice with their lives,7,19 March 2013,"Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of the Seven Samurai is great on many aspects. At first it appears to be only about a bunch of unemployed mercenaries doing their job by defending a village from bandits. It quickly turns to a rather complicating interaction of ideals, social norms, and internal conflicts. Although the bad guys (the bandits) remain generic enemies all the way, the samurais and the villagers are shown to be a lot more than the simple stereotype they begin as. There are lots of minor side stories that flesh them out and enrich the setting with a lot of gray overtones. The movie is not afraid to kill its characters, despite presenting them in a most heroic way. The death toll is high and it is interesting to see how almost all of them are killed by a rifle and not by a petty bandit's spear, which is a double way to show how great they are with the sword, as well as how all your talent means nothing before modern warfare. At the same time it does not leave the villagers to be nothing but passive spectators throughout the battle, as they are given the task to participate. Along the way they are shown to be far more than stunts, as even they have secret agendas and minor problems of their own. Even as far as action goes, the movie is still great, with the swordsmanship and the invasion of the riders, or the ambush in the forest being very well orchestrated, with believable fighting moves that never feel shallow poser nonsense. Even during the non-action parts, the characters are acting very dynamically and expressively, instead of just standing still and talking. Even the ending is basically bittersweet, as despite the losses and victories life goes on but the sadness of the realization of a never- ending struggle is just overbearing. p.s. The same tale has been remade throughout the years, the most famous of which are the cowboy version The Magnificent Seven (1960) and the sci-fi anime version Samurai 7 (2004).",Seven Samurai
224,panchodh_12,"Entertaining, I guess. But sloooow.",6,16 September 2014,"I don't know, I guess I can't help but belong to my own generation. I was going through other user reviews and forum discussions and I simply couldn't understand what was so superlative about this movie. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but is definitely not one of my all-time favourites, and it wasn't that I just couldn't stop watching it.The main problem I found with this movie, I think, was the pace. It was such a slooow movie, and there were so many, from my point of view, useless or too-long shots... That's why I said that I can't help but belong to my own generation. I was just looking at my ratings and the longest movie to which I gave a 10 was 148 minutes long, that's exactly one hour less than this movie. I'm guessing that's a runtime much more fit for these times of Twitter and low attention span; I'm guessing perhaps Ray Bradbury was right and in some future we will all watch nothing but 10-minutes long movies posted on YouTube.Or maybe it's just another way of conceiving the movie-watching experience. Not right, not wrong but different. Perhaps the public in 1954 was much more disposed to watch a 207-minutes long movie, because going to the movies was already a big social event in itself, while in these times, we just stream the movie online in the solitude of our rooms.But all in all, it is a good movie. It is entertaining and the characters are well-developed. Toshirô Mifune's character is by far the best of this movie, and his acting is quite remarkable. The plot is simple, but Kurosawa managed to denote complexity within that simplicity. The scene of the night before the last battle, for example, says a thing or two about human nature.I guess I don't regret having watched it. After all, is quite a classic and everyone says it's Kurosawa's best film. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not into the history of cinema, and I do not intend to watch it again any time soon.",Seven Samurai

The movie may also show some society things of the Japanese society at the time, but I didn't pay much attention.  As a foreigner, I only feel the Japanese-styled sayings and behaviors interesting.

It does not cover any great distances (perhaps a few dozen miles, at most), or stretches of time (maybe a month), and its climactic battle features perhaps sixty to eighty people--it's a positively modest production when compared with other three-hour affairs such as, say, ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Spartacus.""But there is one dimension, at least, in which Akira Kurosawa's opus approaches the epic scope: it leaves no corner of the human spirit or the human condition unexplored. The film is, simply, what it is to be human, in its entirety: courage, fear, love, hate, lust, cruelty, kindness, cameraderie, greed, selflessness, sorrow, laughter. This tale of farmers, bandits and warriors is really a story about all of us--the downtrodden, the wicked and the noble.Very, very rarely, if ever, has a film had such a complete, unerring, and successful devotion to the reality of its characters. And what characters they are--particularly Toshiro Mifune's unforgettable noble savage, Kikuchiyo, and Takashi Shimura's wise and gentle leader, Kambei.I almost feel as if there's nothing to say--deeply insightful, profoundly moving, beautifully made, unfailingly entertaining even with it's 200+ minute running time--a magnificent film, a PERFECT film, perhaps the greatest ever made.",Seven Samurai

231,fog-9,Not bad,7,16 December 2005,"I'm going to start this off by saying I'm not a professional, so my understanding of camera work and cinematography is at layman's levels. However, I think this movie is somewhat overrated. The visuals are impressive and the movie has a more modern feel to it then other movies from the same time. I definitely think it's worthwhile seeing.But I don't agree that the characters are fleshed out. Perhaps a student of Asian history would find this movie fascinating, but if all sorts of important exchanges are happening under the surface, I missed most of them. I suppose it is too much to expect the director to spell out aspects of Japanese life and educate us, but without that, I found the characters stiff caricatures of little interest to me. Much the same as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (although the two movies are VERY different).The movie is simply far too long. While those visuals I mentioned are amazing, I think the editing is horrible. I enjoyed it up to the two hour mark but I knew I was running on empty after that. It suffers the from the same bloating that occurred in older American movies like Gone with the Wind. I know what you're thinking: He has no attention span and is amused by music videos from the MTV era. Well, I do tend to like shorter poems. Why? Brevity is a rare and powerful force. Things should be as long as they need to be. I have enjoyed longer features, and I'm a great fan of movies with slow, beautiful scenes. But this movie collapsed under its own weight.I know many people will disagree, and I might appear foolish to say this, but I don't think foreign films are necessarily better then Hollywood films. The pendulum seems to swing both ways when it comes to this matter, people defending foreign movies as vastly superior to ""mainstream"" movies, or running them down simply because they have to read subtitles and move outside their comfort zone. I don't think foreign status is enough to elevate this movie beyond the ranks of many other good adventure/action movies. With some prudent editing, script revision and greater depth in portrayal, it might even have been great.",Seven Samurai

Oscar winner Toshiro Mifune (Bridge on the River Kwai) plays a comic relief role as a devil-may-care, but suspect samurai. Sad to say I had never watched all 2 hours and 37 minutes of it before.It's essentially the very first ""men on a mission"" action flick, with 7 itinerant Samurai defending a 16th century Japanese country village against bandits. The intricate combat sequences and the tense buildup to them made the time fly by. It's fascinating to see the origins of the genre. Today, it's easy to recognize this action formula because virtually every modern screenwriter uses the same framework.

Lucky because it was shown in the director's cut version. More than 200 minutes. And boy, what 200 minutes was that now...You have to get used to the rhythm of this movie. It goes the way it wants to go, which means: Carefully. Slowly. Treebeard-style. Which is unique and great in one. Other movies about raids and battles transfer the impression, warriors were just running through one battle after the other and the war was just one hell of a rush. Not this one here. This one takes it's time to develop the different characters, the whole style and it loves to play with the Japanese environment and background. I'm fond of ancient Japan so I enjoyed the long takes.Because everything evolves so steadily you suddenly find yourself in big tension, when the fighting starts. And you actually feel sad for every one who falls in battle. You can relate to the villagers. You know the plan of the town. And most of all, you wanna fight amongst the seven Samurai.And when the credits start rolling over the screen, I just didn't want to stand up. I wanted to go on with the guys. I was in a totally different world. Ever since I'm waiting for the director's cut on DVD but in Switzerland, it doesn't seem to exist. But I won't give up!

Kurosawa did everything right with this film. He developed characters we came to care for, gave us gritty scenes of violence, and gave us a look at hard life of farmers.Each of the seven samurai is given a characteristic for which we love them. With Kikuchiyo (play with a fever by Toshiro Mifune) we love his courage, and occasional wisdom while overlooking his hotheadedness, and occasional fits of insanity. Perhaps some of us see some of ourselves in his tortured character who is often striving to try and prove himself. I know I have on occasion jumped into a situation before thinking through the consequences, and he (Kikychiyo) tends to do it to during the course of the film. But his mistakes tend to be larger and the consequences often cost his friends their lives.There are many other likable characters in this film, but I think the true triumph of this film is the humanity of it. We see how the higher class be it Samurai or bandit assume to treat the lower class in this instance the farmers. We see the similarities between them and the differences.While this film may be long, depending on which version you watch (I strongly recommend the 207 minutes long version), it is an excellent film which you will enjoy whether you prefer drama, or comedy, or action, or just films in general.",Seven Samurai

It would take more viewings to really appreciate its greatness. So when I read reviews complaining about its length, I understand them. I encourage everyone, though (mostly to those who found it boring because of its length), not to give up on this film, it really requires more viewings. And if you don't like it, there's nothing wrong with it, after all, you just can't like everything.This film can be divided into three parts: 1- The search for the seven samuraiThe villagers, being oppressed by bandits, decide to stand up and fight this time against them, so they go in search for samurai to help them in that task. This is my favorite part of the film, the recruitment of the seven samurai is one of the best things I've seen in a movie.2.- The preparation for battle (against the bandits) The villagers, with the help of the seven samurai, start their preparation to defend their village and fight against the bandits. This part is also outstanding, the defense planning of the village is something to behold.3.- The Battle The Bandits finally decide to attack the village, the great battle between the villagers and bandits takes place. The battle sequences are really impressive here, the astonishing Kurosawa's camera-work allows you to behold the battle without missing a thing; you can see everything that's happening in the battlefield (mostly when the bandits enter inside the village).I know I didn't get into much plot detail, but I just needed to review this movie and let everybody know that they may not appreciate this film in the first viewing, although there are many that liked it in the first one.",Seven Samurai
243,garydiamond,One of the best action films of all time,8,11 March 2008,"It took me a very long time to get around to watching Seven Samurai in full. I had the DVD for nearly a year before I tried tackling the whole thing head-on. It really is hard to get away from the conditioning of Dolby Surround sound, full colour non-subtitled 90 minute pictures we're so used to now. But when I did, I was glad of it.Lets forget the fact that this picture, much like Citizen Kane before it, set the standards which would come to be developed upon and eventually rendered to the point of cliché in every movie of the genre that would follow. Lets forget it may not have the conventional bells and whistles of most pictures these days.What it does have is stylish direction, breathtaking acting and identifiable characterisation in spades. Indeed, after the first hour, the body language said so much I needed only glance at the subtitles to follow the plot. My personal favourite actor is the first of the seven to be recruited, the restrained and noble elder who goes on to mold his ragtag bunch into a streamlined fighting force. The scene where he arranges for each samurai a reaction test before even SPEAKING to them, is a highlight of the first hour of the film.The pace doesn't feel sluggish or rushed. There are no moments of exposition that feel over-elaborate or forced; everything is revealed in good time. Like all great directors Kurosawa knows how to make you live and breathe the atmosphere of the characters. Rather than making the samurai and the townspeople they defend seem all-holy forces of good he introduces conflict, making them imperfect yet with pure motives that may transcend any shortcomings.Overall, this is one picture that you could spend as long describing as you could watching. Some may argue it has dated badly. Although not every scene has the same impact as it did upon release, every single one counts and contributes to what, 53 years later, still stands as one of the greatest achievements of 20th century cinema. I just hope we don't have to wait until 2053 to see something that matches it in majesty and scope.8/10",Seven Samurai

But I'm glad I did.This movie is exceptional. It definitely exceeded my expectations and even with a legendary 8.6 rating, I do not consider it to be overrated.Kurosawa has clearly accomplished something special here. Despite Its run time you will not find it boring at all.

To watch it and not appreciate it would be like taking a fine wine and saying it's good, but not much better than bottle of cheap plonk.An easy way to tell how much you enjoy the film is to realise how quick it's three hour running time went by you.

246,phaneendrakumar,One of the best films I ever saw.,10,29 May 2009,"Seven Samurai has been a pioneer in action genre of cinema. Many shots that are conceptualized by Akira Kurasawa in the film are copied later by the greats like Steven Spielberg and others in their movies. The film itself inspired many classics in almost all the languages later. Sholay is one such example.The screenplay of this movie is undoubtedly, one of the best ever. The movie starts and within five seconds, the viewer is immersed in the movie without any second thought... That is the magic of Kurasawa's screenplay. There are many instances in the film where the viewer identify himself with the protagonist, the samurai. The film portrays the drought periods of Japan with intense. The comic reliefs are imbibed with utmost sensuality into the story with a great mastery. Undoubtedly, this movie is a text book of sorts for all those who are wannabe script writers out there.Watch this movie to believe the magic.

247,Davor_Blazevic_1959,"Arguably, the best samurai film ever made",10,25 May 2010,"Though its biblical connotation is not the happiest one (""Seven Deadly Sins"") number seven, omnipresent in our (7 days a) weekly cycles, seems to have been a lucky number in the world of cinema. Several very solid and some great movies have this number in their title, starting with gag-wise incredibly inventive Seven Chances (1925) from genius of silent era Buster Keaton, Frank Borzage's silent version of classic melodrama 7th Heaven (1927), Walt Disney's first feature-length animated movie, Snowhite and Seven Dwarfs (1940), recognized as an instant classic and remained so ever after, Stanley Donen's ear-pleasing, eye-riveting musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), staged in western milieu, with the breathtaking barn-raising dance sequence, Ingmar Bergman's literally Death-defying, answers-to-reasons-for-human-misfortune-seeking masterpiece, Det sjunde inseglet (""The Seventh Seal"") (1957), Billy Wilder's Seven Year Itch (1957), a clever and amusing first collaboration with incomparable Marilyn Monroe (a worm-up for their second, bigger if not decisive step in taboos-of-the-motion-picture-production-code-breaking, brilliant comedy Some Like It Hot (1959)), up to newer examples like David Fincher's disturbing drama Se7en (1995), one of the finest Hollywood movies of the 90's, as well as Tsui Hark's Chat Gim (""Seven Swords"") (2005), a stunner in the department of action sequences from the often under-appreciated genre Wuxia, originating from Chinese literature.However, even among such illustrious examples of movie-making par excellence, one movie holds a special place, Shichinin no samurai (""Seven Samurai"") (1954) from the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. This movie doesn't seem to lack anything that an avid movie consumer, in particular samurai genre admirer, might be wishing for.It is not easy to say anything new about the one of the most analyzed and scrutinized movies of the film history. Nevertheless, and despite being eventually only repeated, it shall be mentioned that movie has a simple but very engaging story - a group of peasants, representing a village, periodically stormed by gang of bandits, looting their crops and other possessions, hires several wandering ronins (masterless samurai) to help them protect the village - not without lucid observations on the possibility of social interaction between members of different classes during the almost seven centuries long feudal history (1185-1868) of Japan.Characterization is excellent, and though having clear stand-outs in samurai's true leader, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), a wise tactician of the exceptional valor, as well as in the exuberantly uncontrollable Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), messy in its appearance and blustering in its manner, yet, a peasant descendant himself, making for a perfect link between the samurai and their employers, all other samurai are memorable, as well, sporting wide variety of personality traits. In joining the village protection campaign, hired for nothing more than a regular meal for as long as providing a service, thus primarily hoping to finally fill their starving stomachs, each one of them was driven by different additional motives, whether they were challenged to test their bravery, fighting skills and tactics, seeking for excitement and recognition, trying to regain pride and glory of the past days, just reaching out for that human touch (cross-class communication, even mere courtship promising relationship) they have been deprived of, or simply interested in its noble cause.Together with true highlights in realistically choreographed battle scenes, showing all the pain and misery of excessive violence on the reverse of heroism, that even defenders cannot avoid resorting to, sadly announcing inevitable decline of the samurai and their ways exposed to new artless technology, unbecomingly dying ambushed by distant shots from the muskets, while ingloriously stuck in the village muds... it all makes for a compelling narrative.Though triumphant in their common task to protect the village, unlikely alliance between samurai and peasants is ultimately doomed to fail. In the short run, it gives expected results, but in the long run, does not stand the chance. That is so loudly, although in fact silently, expressed at the end, when peasants don't even care to join the surviving samurai in their mourning over the fallen ones, not even giving the last well deserved respect to those who have helped them withstand fierce attacks, prevail and ultimately defeat bandits, and, in doing so, most of them given their lives. Peasants simply continue with their daily chores, while surviving samurai have to leave the village, like they have never existed, sadly symbolizing their ultimate destiny: slowly but surely stepping off the future pages of the history books.Seven Samurai, the movie, is rightfully considered as the one that has redefined samurai film in its contemporary perception, and dawned almost two decades long string of successes, instantly becoming the brightest example of thus revived, uniquely provocative and entertaining sub-genre, unknown as such in the country of its origin, classified there within a broader genre, jidaigeki (a period drama, often describing events from pre-modern era of the Edo period, marking the governance of Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), relatively peaceful times for Japan's long history of civil wars, as opposed to gendaigeki, films treating contemporary matters), and by IMDb standards, as an action drama, occasionally historical, when based on real events.Originating in the Edo-era Far East, it has inspired equally successful, star-studded (Y. Brynner, S. McQueen, C. Bronson, J. Coburn, E. Wallach, R. Vaughn, H. Buchholz, B. Dexter) Hollywood remake, The Magnificent Seven (1960), conveniently situated in the U.S. West of 19th century, as well as three lesser sequels, Return of... (1966), Guns of... (1969), and ...Ride! (1972).",Seven Samurai

249,Carrzinho,Seminal but at times sedentary,7,3 September 2019,"Well, some movies are labeled epic and this certainly falls into that category tipping the scales at 3hr 21min. It also falls into the Citizen Kane category in that its massively influential predating almost every western of note and every western in the grittier second wave including the Magnificent Seven which would transition from ""influenced by"" to practically remade. No shortage of pedigree then.
Seven Samurai are hired for the meagre price of food and board to save a poor village from the annual pillage (and rape) at the hands of a gang of 40 bandits. Each of the Seven samurai are well written and easily definable characters in their own right. The villagers are more homogenous but there are a few fleshed out a bit more to provide interest, pathos, humour or indeed a love interest.
While the main cast are generally convincing a huge amount of the ancillary roles are irritatingly overacted. There is plenty of good humour to be found but some of it verging on childlike. There are far too many ""by numbers"" moments that fail to give credit to the viewer in what is often a subtle piece of work.
While 3hr 21min is no doubt time consuming, i've never found it off putting. However, there's an effortless hour to be shaved off here. I never expected to learn so much about rural farming or geographical warfare tactics. The aforementioned Magnificent Seven manages to cut a full hour and 13 minutes without compromising a facsimile of the plot. It doesn't result in a better movie movie but it takes a good wedge of slog out of it. It also justifies the motivations of the ""heroes"" better than Kurosawa's version.
I mentioned Citizen Kane earlier specifically and could easily have mentioned perhaps Night of the Living Dead. These movies all have incredible legacies but while all very good they are not exceptional movies in their own right. They do remain essential viewing though. There is so much to love about pacing and characterisation, filming action, dealing with grim and gritty subject matter that it warrants your attention. It is also true that because it is so influential, that many of the idea's and stylings have been more successfully implemented in latter years and likely in movies you've seen. So at times you'll find yourself watching this movie more for how it has influenced movies thereafter than for the movie itself.
In summation if you're a cinephile tick off a box here. If you're looking for what is a high calibre western try The Wild Bunch or The good, The Bad and the Ugly. If you want to experience Kurosawa, i'd argue that it's not even his best work, preferring Yojimbo or Rashomon myself. SEVEN",Seven Samurai

The cinematography that shows variety angles of fighting scenes were very impressive. I especially liked the scene when a guy falls down slowly after he lost the duel with one of the seven samurai. Also, like John Woo's films, even though this is a action film(?), it asks the meanings of loyalty, friendship, love and justice. At the ending, when the village people do not seem to recognize the samurai after they defeated the nobles, I felt remorse for the samurai and asked myself what they fought and died for. But it was a cool ending because it was different from many cheezy action hero movie endings. It was a very philosopical but also a very exciting film.",Seven Samurai

253,gga,Not as good as...,7,5 April 2000,"...his other work (Ikiru, Rashomon, etc), still this movie is loved by audiences since it is one of Kurosawa's films with a traditional Hollywood script.  Inspired by American westerns, it is only fitting that the film was later adapted several times to that setting. There's little depth in this movie, compared to Kurosawa's other pieces.  It is just pure entertainment, dealing briefly with issues such as honor, mismatched lovers and solidarity. The movie feels a little long nowadays, and it does take some time to get started.  But this setup pays off later on. Battle plans are explained before hand so the public can follow the action sequences in the same way a general can.  And once the battle begins, you won't be able to stop watching. Mifune steals the best, funniest and of the most memorable scenes in the movie, as an infiltrated soldier in enemy lines. The action is dramatic and the stunts are outstanding.  With hundreds of extras, great b&w photography and an impressive production, the movie takes on epic qualities that have little to envy to any Hollywood production.",Seven Samurai
254,jmcody,A work of art. That's all one can say,10,23 December 1999,"Akira Kurosawa was perhaps the finest filmmaker the world has ever seen. Certainly influenced by other masters like John Ford, Orson Welles, Jean Renoir and others (reading his autobiography says so much), Kurosawa found a way to take their impressive visual styles all his own. He also perhaps became the one director to managed to make visual novels. Seven Samurai is but only one example of what he was able to do not only visually, but narratively as well. Many film makers set out to make art and fail becuase they overlook the absolute necessity that novels, films and plays require a captivating linear narrative that contains interesting and realistic characters placed in exaggerated and urgent circumstances. This does it. It not only contains breathtaking action, three dimensional characters and phenomenal performances (Toshiro Mifune creates arguably the finest physical and presentational performance ever caught on film) but speaks poignantly about what it means to be a human being. Like all great works of art, it transcends language and culture.  It's scenes are not so much scenes as they are chapters in an epic. This ranks right up there with The Odyssey, The works of Shakespeare and the paintings of Van Gogh (another influence of Kurosawa's). It is that important and significant to the history of human artistic achievement. This is not to be missed. A 10 out of 10!",Seven Samurai

Shinobu's character is so deep and touching and it has something really human, something imperfect but really great. Some movie researchers have spoke hours and hours about the movie's many levels, how the story works no matter how you look in it. I must say that I agree. Still, I must say that the movie is little a bit too great for me, I have hard time finding all the symbols and levels of the movie. Also Kurosawa's way to describe things, it's so clear and so human like, almost too realistic. I considered it long time to give this movie 10, like I gave Kenji Mizoguchi's Victory of Women. And if I have to evaluate this movie from the view of it's achievements as a story about Japanese life, or historical content, I would no doubt gave the movie full points.

Instead of giving people a sense of procrastination, they can gradually introduce the audience into the mood of the upcoming story. The soundtrack of this film is also very good, and it plays a role in prompting the storyline. In the movies I have seen before, I have never found that the soundtrack can occupy such an important position in a movie. .Of course, the most outstanding feature of the film is the plot and character settings. The suspense laid by the film and the climax caused by the suspense are estimated to be beyond count with both hands. The mention of the peasant Li Ji, who is soaring after marriage, the mad kiku Kiyoyo, the warrior who shaved to save the child, the martial arts strong and calm calm warrior who captured the gun suspense. Each character seems to have its own specific expression, just like a label, which implies the character's character and predicts the character's ending. Like the farmer Li Ji, most of the film is very serious for most of the time, it turned out to be because the thief was wearing a green hat. Kikuyo, a hippie with a big smiley nerve, finally died under the firearm of a bandit.

The multi character development, the small romantic storyline, the extremely exaggerated goof-ball character, the stone face serious warrior...almost everything. It was all started here, a simple Japanese film, that went on to influence people like George Lucas and Sergio Leone (maybe more so with Yojimbo with Leone) into making the best films ever witnessed in the 20th century. Even Anime also, the Japanese animation art form, seems to have been influenced in some way by this film.Yet its simple at its core, what gives the movie its critical acclaim is not because introduced these now common place plot and film elements...its because they did them well, very well in fact. So well its still watchable for many people today, not just a select few who grew up in that era or are interested in old school cinema.Two things that impressed me the most were the sophisticated camera shots (very ahead of its time for a movie made in 1954) and the incredibly engaging characters.

Innovative, humane, and thoughtful, to be sure, with rich cinematography and some strong acting, all of which make it a film to be much admired.  It has its faults, though, partly in the editing--there are places it is needlessly fat, in my opinion--but namely, for me, in the acting of the supporting cast.  The overacting which seems to be a common curse of many older films is on display here, with wailing and gnashing of teeth a bit too earnest and plentiful.  And it can't be said that that's just a symptom common to all older films, because it's not.  Any number of older films--Casablanca, Singin' in the Rain, Ninotchka, The Philadelphia Story, to name a paltry few--put the lie to that myth.  Not least important, either, is the fact that I wasn't swept up in its story.  I was interested in it, to be sure, but I didn't connect with it emotionally like I do with the films I tend to rate better.

But it is probably the best one to start with, as it introduces so many of the elements of Kurosawa's films.  I may be the only person who wishes that this film was actually LONGER, as I would like to get to know several of these characters a little better.  Still, that's probably not the point, as the film is intended to be epic and monumental.  Yojimbo is more intimate, while Ran is more mythical and operatic.

All of this negative energy turned a village full of village fools into a village full of losers, every death bringing a smile of sadistic triumph to my face!

So if you are not familiar with the work of this Master Director then start with this movie and if you already are a fan then this is a must watch, re-watch. Numerous movies have been made in the line with this subject and some of them are really good too but this Japanese masterpiece which was made more than 50 years ago, is still a treat to watch for many moviegoers. The story revolves around a village which is frequently attacked by forty some bandits which makes the village to hire seven samurai's (fighters) to save them from the attacks. Movie then deals with how the samurai are hired one by one and then how they prepare for the fight with bandits and their work in the village. It also depicts the suffering of the villagers and samurai too at the same time as they are out of work. AK's direction is superior, camera work is excellent, screenplay is tight and the acting by most of the actors are good but the stand out performances were by Takashi Shimura as the leader of the samurai and Toshiro Mifune as a samurai who acts as mad man and fools around all the time. These two actors are among the best Japanese actors and have worked in many movies with Kurosawa. Nothing more I can add about this movie which is not already discussed by someone or have been repeated in some other movie, so I would just say grab this movie and watch it, don't go by the length of the movie, as you will enjoy it very much if you are into foreign movies, or even otherwise it's a good watch. 10/10.",Seven Samurai

I was not disappointed.  In fact, it is probably UNDER rated.  Brilliant acting - a great plot, surrounded by wonderful Cinematography makes this film worth watching over and over again.

271,groatski,Long and sometimes hard to follow.,7,18 October 2005,"Okay, call me an ignorant, uncultured, short-attention-span Yank if you wish, but I found this movie drawn-out and difficult to follow. It was indeed masterful storytelling with great character development, but the movie seemed to take quite a long time to get going, and when it did it was not the cinematic juggernaut I was expecting. Perhaps my expectations were too high? I don't think so. As of this writing Seven Samurai is at #6 in the all-time greatest movies list (and the only foreign-born film in the top 20), so I've obviously missed something big.This was by no means a bad movie; it was in fact a very good movie. However, all the really excellent movies I've seen have one thing in common - they carry you away with them. You get so involved with the story and characters that you feel like you know them personally. I did not get that here. Instead I kept trying to figure out what was going on, and why people were dramatically wailing and rolling on the ground in reaction to situations that didn't seem to warrant it. Is there perhaps a cultural difference that I'm not linking into? Am I over-analyzing it? I fully expected to walk away from this film wide-eyed and and muttering 'Wow. Just.wow' over and over (as I have with so many other films on IMDb's top 100), but instead I'm left to ponder why I seem to be the only one who's not getting it. I'd watch it again, but 3-1/2 hours is a long time.",Seven Samurai

273,driffma,Brilliant composition plus brilliant acting = brilliant flawless movie!,10,31 August 2001,"It is hard to know exactly where to begin when talking about a film of such utter quality.  What must be said at the start is that ""The Seven Samurai"" is flawless.  It's characters are brought to life by some of the finest and most committed acting I have ever seen. It is a compelling story of courage, duty, honor, respect and change.I could echo Roger Ebert's commentary, in which he noted that Kurosawa's film set the standard for the modern action film. It was he notes the first film to assemble a team of hardened men to undertake a mission.  But I say read Eberts review if you want to get his take.I have watched the film several times and what is truly amazing about ""The Seven Samurai"" is the way in which Kurosawa choses to tell his tale, which is, I think, truly innovative and subtle.Growing up on action fare as we have ""Seven Samurai"" should really hold no magic for us.  We have the formula (in many forms) before.  Countless times. However it is not old to us and magic it carries. I make the case (now anyway) that this comes largely from Kurosawa's knack,  his amazing gift, for photographic composition.  Most filmmakers today in the action genre have some flare for flashy cinematography.  We get sharp angles, dramatic poses (most favorably lighted), and fast cuts.  I guess this is to involve us in the high emotion of the situation.  But Kurosawa has patience and while I think he gave the blocking of his shots, and their composition a great deal of thought, it comes across as if he did not.  His camera moves as though it were simply following the characters through the story.  The camera work in ""Seven"" is so much more subtle and so much more compelling than almost any action fare today.  His camera allows, we the viewer, to be, at various times, all of the major characters in the film.Toshiro Mifune's emotional explosion at his ""fellow"" Samurai is probably the most obvious example of this.  He gets up and at first appears to agree with the Samurai sentiment that killing all of the villagers is a good idea, but when he turns and his anger is directed at them the scene and our place in it change.  We are no longer passive viewers watching heated exchange between two factions.  The angry Toshiro is yelling at us, looking down at us.  For we are looking up at him as his fellow samurai would see him. By the end of his out burst he angrily leaves the room but before he goes he turns slightly to look at us, but we don't see his face, for now we are looking (in one of the great shots of the film) at his feet.  The Samurai are ashamed and so are we because we identified with them at first and Kurosawa had the guts to show us that we are wrong to do so.I could go on, and on about his film, but I leave you with this, watch  it.",Seven Samurai
274,TKDLion8,Only one flaw,10,14 April 2012,Really the only fault that I can find in this movie is that a couple of the seven were totally forgettable characters. I honestly didn't remember them from one scene to the next. This isn't something I would think about in a factual drama such as a film about the 47 ronin but this is fiction and there were only seven. This didn't decrease my enjoyment of the movie though.Toshiro Mifune was really funny in this movie. It was great fun to see him carrying that odachi. I don't recognize any of the other actors but the head samurai also had a good screen presence.If you like samurai movies and don't mind a long run time then this movie is for you.,Seven Samurai
275,Scarletfire-1,Skin head wigs and millet - a pointless storyline,4,17 February 2004,"The Seven Samurai suffers from several near fatal flaws that make watching it very tedious.  Most foreign movies are so bad that this may be better by comparison, but its still a bad movie.One of the most ridiculous things about it is the way many of the actors are wearing really obvious skin head wigs.  They look so fake you can't help but but focus on them.  Why not have the actors all shave their heads for a while during filming? I don't understand why they couldn't find some Japanese guys with shaved heads to act in the movie?  Weren't there tons of people in Japan who already had their head's shaved like that?  Why not just get them instead?  Who knows?  Nobody knows...The whole thing about the villagers eating millet and guarding a bowl of rice like it was made of gold was just silly.  These are farmers that are growing rice - why wouldn't they have tons of it?  Another unanswerable question.Why do the villagers need these Samurai anyways?  Do they really need someone to teach them to sharpen some sticks and use them as spears against the bandits?   The idea that they are oh so helpless and need the Samurai to protect them is the key to the whole movie - and its such a poor premise that you wonder why they made the film in the first place.Perhaps its surprising that a movie of this length would be made in postwar Japan, but that's no reason to say its a really good movie.  Anyone looking at it objectively will agree that it is not - not even close.
They really should have done a major rewrite to the script before going ahead with filming.",Seven Samurai
276,jasonsurety,WOW,10,7 November 2003,"I have been renting movies from netflix at a good pace for about 3 months now.  During that time I have done my best to see films that are critically acclaimed as well as intriguing to me.  Among the movies I've received; Citizen Kane, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, A Streetcar Named Desire, Dog Day Afternoon, Vertigo, Rear Window, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, 2001, Platoon and Requiem For a Dream are generally thought of as classics or at least excellent films.  These are a few choice rentals I really enjoyed.  While I still have a long list of classics and modern-day marvels to go, I feel like I have seen some great flicks. The latest movie that was recommended to me by the Netflix gurus(that rating movies thing really works) was Seven Samurai. The only time I had ever heard of Kurosawa was in a Bare Naked Ladies song.  After reading a bit about him and some of his other films I will be sure to delve into his large assembly of cinema.  Seven Samurai is his best-known film, so it was a good place to start. The movie lived up to or outdid all promises of critics, historians, and fans.  I utterly enjoyed this film.  I even watched some of the commentary feature on the DVD.  Compared to the afore-mentioned films I would have to rank this one atop them.  I gave a few of those movies a vote of 10 and I sincerely meant it.  With this film I would vote 11 if it was possible.

277,aj-to,What's all the fuzz?,7,13 November 2005,"I really don't get why this film rates that high in the top 250. Based on other reviews, my expectations on seeing Seven Samurai were high. But I only found myself wondering why this should be the 'film of films'. On the contrary, I found it quite mediocre and was bored. People say, on appreciating it you should realize it's an old movie and that by means of the cinematic it was very revolutionary in its days. But why then is there a total lack of that approach with respect to other old movies? Why should I suddenly be so scrupulous on seeing The Seven Samurai? Because of its icon status? Well, I don't agree. Sure, I enjoyed the film, for me it had its good moments, but not more than an average other movie. In fact, most of the time I felt embarrassed to my wife, looking the film with me and to whom I had recommended it because of the lyric reviews. I expected something quite different. To me, it was boring, slow, often strange and, like I said, certainly not better than many other films I know. I'm puzzled why this film ranks so high in the top 250, immediately after Schindler's List. Probably I'm so blunt that all the greatness spotted by other people escapes to me.",Seven Samurai
278,smits59,"Intens, but not flawless",10,26 December 2006,"Let me first say: the seven samurai is a very gripping movie. There is hardly a moment in the movie that is not absolutely worth your time, which is quite a feat for a movie that is over three hours long.But the movie is not perfect. Like in most older Japanese movies the characters are almost cartoon-like, and so is their behavior. So much even that you can watch the Japanese-language version, which you should, without subtitles and still understand everything that is going on. The genius of Kurosawa gets away with it. Almost any other director would not have been able to make a serious movie in such a cartoon-style. And then there is the goofs. People switch positions when viewpoints change back and forth. People get stabbed again and again and still walk away as if tickled by a feather. How does this fit a movie in which every shot is supposed to be handcrafted? None the less, this is a wonderful movie and a landmark in movie-history. But one should see all of the movie and not just it's magic. So in my opinion The Seven Samurai is a very intense, very worthwhile movie. But it's not flawless.",Seven Samurai
279,Clockwork_Orange55,One of the Greatest,10,2 September 2016,"This original Akira Kurosawa's classic which trampled upon its remakes, is indeed one of the greatest films ever made. In all film lists discussed by experts, agreeable or not, ""Seven Samurai"" had mostly made in the first 10 position. The fact postulated the idea that ""Seven Samurai"" is still vital to world cinema, and from its highly influential plot devices to its strong filmmaking, and to its haunting ending, it is all perfect in its facets.Set during the civil wars in Japan in the 16th century, conflicts led villages to be vulnerable and be overran by bandits. They are about to raid a village and the news quickly being raised up to the elder (chief), in which he advises the villagers they should hire hungry Samurai to defend themselves against the onslaught of the thieves, specifically stating ""Even bears come down from mountains when they're hungry."" (This refers to the seven Samurai.).""Seven Samurai"" goes into depth depicting philosophical ideas, human nature and genuine human emotions. One of the sequences explores Ronin (masterless Samurai) Kambei Shimada's (Takashi Shimura) background, in which he speaks about him ambitions in his early days, but to be unfortunate when he did realise that he had spent too much time chasing his dreams but achieves nothing. Perhaps the character was being directed or written not to articulate his emotions clearly, but through experiences we could comprehend that he is remorseful for his failures. Another haunting moment is its ending, where the surviving inhabitants of the village completely shown to disregard the Samurai, notwithstanding the seven heroes being their primary support. The notion is further accentuated with the closing line: ""In the end, we lost the battle tooThe victory belongs to the peasants. Not to us."" Earlier, the villagers could already be seen as cold when they refuse to greet the Samurai upon their arrival to the village, thus giving a cold reception. But there might be another theory for this; the villagers are actually afraid of the Samurai exploits, which explains on why they beg off to go out from their hiding place, and face the Samurai.""Seven Samurai"" is a great tool for film students to look into character development. Seven great characters, played by seven great actors, are regurgitated for good. In it we could discover unalike personalities, and each of them being explored accordingly throughout. Even the relationship between the villagers and Samurai is well developed. Other than its strong writing and performances, its editing, cinematography and directing are all solid.More than five decades after its release, ""Seven Samurai"" still comes unscathed to serious viewers; such is the quality of it. And with the rehash of it that we witness today (""The Magnificent Seven"" is the most obvious one), we can say it is one of the most influential works of cinematic art. Its withheld influence would suggest that Kurosawa might have had done this for posterity.

It has the plot of all of our modern team action flicks such as The Avengers, Ocean's Eleven and MacGruber (just the top of my head). The heroes are a team that slowly forms during the first half of the film and the second part of the film is some form of a ""heist"" movie with the planning of traps and strategies, with some very intense action scenes between the ""graceful"" samurai and the bandits. The samurai are really the stars of the show: interesting and fleshed out characters that you really love during the course of the film. The relationships between the characters are also interesting. It's true that this film is quite daunting: black and white, quite long (you can see it in two times, there is an intermission even though it has a bigger emotional impact if you stay with the samurai for the whole film straight) and subtitled.

Akira Kurosawa is a unique director and has a wondrous vision.Seven Samurai's first two hours is melodramatic. It features a tale of powerless villagers, whom are in shortage of food, and defenceless against a heavily armed gang of mischievous bandits. In order to restore their sanctuary and stow off the bandits, seven samurai warriors are formed and trained up in the tactics of field combat, to fight of the bandits.These pleasing two hours are live up to their fulfilment and the characters are introduced and developed, splendidly. There is enough to please movie-goers, here, and fans of old, classic movies will find Seven Samurai satisfactory. It kick started the Hollywood western, The Magnificent Seven, which is, too, a classic. There is no closure to pleasing samurai fans, and the Japanese audience, in particular, will find that there is nothing displeasing, here. The Fantastically written script of melodramatic elements, in its first two hours, leads, promisingly, to an hour and a half of spectacular stunt takes and field combat sequences. The Seven Samurai themselves are to be made noteworthy of this, for they are the show-stealers and stars of the show. This will meet fan's satisfactory, as the combat sequences are filmed so well, and the performances are nothing short of mesmerising.This spectacular movie is a classic and achievable in many ways, leaving generations of fans and Akira Kurosawa fans, alike, to a legacy of magnificent art.",Seven Samurai

If Akira Kurosawa were to be remembered for only one film, this one has my vote. I feel similarly about the late, great actor, Toshiro Mifune, in one of the leading roles as Kikuchiyo. The power and beauty of this film arise from so many levels. The photography is masterful, as are the story telling and direction.  The characters are fascinating and richly developed, the actors impeccable. The progressively dramatic action  sequences are authentic and unforgettable.

290,drewconnor,The most entertaining movie i have ever seen,10,10 November 2013,"Every fan of movies should see a Kurosawa, and this is (along with Yojimbo) the most accessible of his many great works. The film is an artistic and technical masterpiece, but above all it is a rousing adventure story, gripping and emotionally involving from the start. The origin of the film lies in an idea for a story Kurosawa had about a samurai who made a tiny mistake and went home and committed suicide. Told this wouldn't work, he and his writing team began researching the 16th century, and became interested in the fact that villagers would hire samurai as night guards to protect them from bandits, the samurai receiving food and lodging in return. This evolved into Seven Samurai, Kurosawa's greatest jidai-geki (period drama), about desperate peasants who turn to professional warriors when bandits repeatedly raid their harvest. Kurosawa draws fantastic performances from his cast, most notably Takashi Shimura (as the samurai leader Kambei, the living embodiment of the samurai code) and Toshiro Mifune (as the peasant turned warrior, Kikuchiyo), and marshals the elements for an astonishing climactic battle scene in the mud and the rain. This ten-minute sequence has to be seen to be believed; the images have a painterly quality (Kurosawa trained in western-style painting) but are also extremely realistic, perfectly capturing the chaos of the battlefield as figures wade through the mire, hacking at each other. I've heard it remarked that this sequence was in Spielberg's mind when he conceived the Omaha Beach landing scene in Saving Private Ryan; and indeed, the use of grainy film stock, the slightly speeded-up movement and fast editing, and the depiction of war as utter chaos all seem rooted in Kurosawa.A final word: do not be put off by the 190 minute running time or the fact that it is subtitled. Although Kurosawa has the reputation of an auteur, he was also a brilliant and influential storyteller. This is perhaps the most entertaining great movie ever made.",Seven Samurai

Kurosawa's crowning achievement is not a film to be missed.  If you're a fan of samurai films, Japanese cinema, or just good films in general, I strongly suggest that you see ""The Seven Samurai,"" not only for its blistering, brutal fight sequences, but also for its touching examination of what it is to be the few on the side of good, when there is so much evil to fight against.",Seven Samurai

You have a clearly defined good (samurai) and bad (bandits) side and then a somewhat ambiguous side (the farmers). The reason why the movie is great is not because of the classical story line, but the small details put in that exhibit alot of humor, bravery, and spirituality. Everyone who sees the film will always remember the seventh samurai (Mifune), and how they would try to hit a samurai with a stick as he came in the door. ""Find hungry samurai"" was a memorable line by Gisaku, the town old wiseman. When looking at great films, we all notice the same characteristics: no pretention, pure storytelling, and scenes which force the truth out of the characters involved.

One village decides to do something about this; they will hire samurai warriors to protect their goods and their lives, for harvesting season is just around the corner. They don't have much to offer the samurai - just food and a roof, actually. They manage to attain seven samurai for this foolhardy plan (five, really, two aren't official samurai warriors). The rest of the film details the misadventures of this motley group of people as they must quickly coalesce into a team to defeat the nasty warlords. The film is amazingly able to bring together many different genres to make a coherent whole. It is an adventure/action movie, funny, romantic, and genuinely insightful of human nature all at the same time. It is filled with brilliant images; director Kurasawa was a master of cinema, one of only a handful of directors born to make movies (see his Ran,  Kagemusha, and The Hidden Fortress, for example).

Seven Samurai has no redeeming value whatsoever.Even the subtitles sucked.  In fact, they were the absolute worse I've ever seen.  Half the dialogue either wasn't translated or was white or white and therefore unreadable!  This made the plot hard to follow; fortunately, there wasn't much to follow.  A five year old could guess the conclusion after the first 10 minutes!A lot of people say there is incredible depth in 7 samurai.  They must be on crack.  The characters on incredibly shallow.  We learn nothing about anyone in the movie.  You'd think in three hours one could probe the characters minds - find out why they act as they do, but nope, once a character is introduced their developement stops.Then their are the inane sub-plots that go nowhere.  Please!  If you are going to introduce a plot device, have it go somewhere.  In real life, everything isn't meaningful, but this isn't real life - it is a movie.  If I wanted to see pointless stuff happening, I could look out my window!It is said that the Brigand's helmet inspired Darth Vader's.  If that's true, then the dumb ""comic"" guy must have inspired Jar-Jar (that is not a good thing).  At least Lucas had an excuse for including a dumb character - Phantom Menace was a kids movie.  Akira had no business doing so in Seven Samurai.So why does this movie have such a high rating?  I attribute it primarily to the fact that everyone is afraid to you they didn't like a ""classic.""  If people stopped thinking like drones, maybe we could come to realize that some ""classics"" really aren't very good.

The story is filled with many rich and diverse characters, the setting takes one to another time and place, and the plot develops in three distinct parts with increasing intensity.  But more than just a cinematic page-turner, this is the definitive war movie, from the mustering of troops to the battle strategies played out to the punctuating comment of a warrior as he looks over the graves of the fallen.  This movie deserves its place on the all-time best list.",Seven Samurai
299,beckersjos,Akira,10,8 December 2007,"This is film-making at his best. Akira Kurosawa did what other great directors tried to do. To make an action/drama/love-story/martial-arts/historical correct and so much more film,making it last for almost 4hours,without us ever getting bored. Not only did he do that,it opened the road for many clones(good and bad).The way Kurosawa films had lots of influence on later filmmakers. JOhn Sturges to name one. But you can hardly make a good film without good actors.Well Toshirô Mifune might be the most known in this film,but here Kurasawa makes him work for his money. Each and everyone of the actor's put down first-rate performances. Giving a title for the best actor,is impossible. They all are excellent. Flawless. Divine. This truly is film-making of the best kind.OK,I'm repeating myself. Giving to much credit, even if it's justified ,looks silly. But not here,not for this film/actors/director/photography/........ For those who haven't seen it yet. Don't buy the dubbed version. Buy the original B/W with subs. You will not be disappointed. Oh,yes. It's Kurosawa's best.

I myself study Japanese sword movement ""Shinkendo"" and found the sword movement superb and flawless and would love to be able to achieve such movement one day myself;spoiler possibility; as for the plot of the bandits raiding the farming village and not giving up even after losing quite a few of their men in their first attack against the village (now protected by samurai), that is traditional culture for Japanese > more recent example would be pearl harbor > Japanese won't give up till they have reached their achievement or have died ,,, i also read that a few viewers have found it a boring movie that would be then that they prefer action without story over a well balanced action/story movie and also i notice many people miss the essence of the story in the movie >>> so if you love to see really classical movies with lot of story in it and plenty of action, and like to watch movies that show many aspects of a foreign culture then watch this movie but if you prefer movies that are straight forward action, no-brain movies then this would not be a movie for you",Seven Samurai

You forget that you are reading subtitles, you forget the the movie is 50 years old. You forget that it is in black and white. Subtly, but assuredly, the viewer has become a villager, nervous and anxious for what comes next.I don't know if this movie is my 5th favorite of all time (where this movie ranked at the time of my review), however it is extremely powerful, unique, moving and memorable of movies that rarely cross the fine line between excellence, and unbelieavable.I heartily recommend this movie.

Perhaps the best Kurosawa film I've  seen to date, this stars brilliant acting, wonderful scriptwriting, remarkably good dialogue, and my favorite actor -- Toshiro Mifune. A small Japanese farming village is terrorized by fourty brigands, and the distraught farmers hire a most ragtag group of six samurai, plus a drunken villiager (played by Mifune) who pretends to be one. With well-done action scenes, emotionally charged performances, and impressive cinematography, personally I think this movie is better than all the 90s blockbusters combined.",Seven Samurai
306,diffusionx,A Very Long Movie that Manages to Stay Watchable,10,27 March 2000,"Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is 207 minutes long, yes, but it is a movie that gives back to the viewer every one of those minutes. It's a 207 minute long movie in which every single scene is necessary, and everything is essential to moving the story forward. In spite of being so long, it manages to remain eminently watchable because, save for a tiny bit at the very end, something new happens every single time. The characters are perfectly acted and all are interesting and fit into the story. The tale manages to stay simple, but epic in scope - it's easy to see the plight of the farmers, but it's also easy to see how scared they are of the samurai invading their way of life, especially in the beginning and middle of the movie.Of course, Kurosawa's direction is brilliant - the movie never lags, is loaded with subtle symbolism and small details, and the camerawork is always right on and highlights the action while still showing the details around it that enrich each scene. It's easy to see that Seven Samurai really is one of the finest movies ever made - it may take quite a while to watch from beginning to end, but it is quite engrossing and a real treat to watch.",Seven Samurai
307,nightstrife,This is a fine movie for all time...,10,11 April 2006,"Movie watching doesn't get much better than this... This movie is an absolute masterpiece - it is such a wonderful movie that it will be hard to imagine that 200 minutes have passed, as the events in it are so logically placed and the story told in such a way that following it is a pleasure rather than a chore. Few movies can achieve this feat alone - holding concentration of an audience for more than microseconds these days often requires a massive pyrotechnics budget...Akira Kurosawa was a genius, and even to this day and is inspiring many to follow in his footsteps...This movie is one that people who enjoy engrossing cinema will appreciate - action fans can look elsewhere, as can those fools who believe a movie is an opportunity to ""switch-off"" and stop thinking. Movies should be an opportunity to see life through someone else's life and their time - or in the case of this movie, many lives and one single time...Seeing bandits being led to their deaths is reason enough to watch this - appreciating the characters is another. The honour of the fight, the loyalty to themselves and the learned loyalty to others, and the beautiful, heart wrenching ending... This movie is exceptional in every way.Thank you, Akira Kurosawa, you will be missed, but your inspiration and vision will remain for the ages...Cheers!",Seven Samurai

Kurosawa succeed to make a perfect movie that will combine drama ,comedy, romance , philosophy and definitely most powerful. dynamic and intense battle scenes ever filmed ,( nowadays directors should watch it and learn how to direct a battle scene ) .despite 200 minutes of running time ""Seven Samurai"" doesn't bore at all. this movie has such a strong spirit it's epic . the storyline is strong and the character's are amazing ,each of them is very well developed, which gives the movie more depth. visually the movie looks beautiful , pure and perfect cinematography . Kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time a lot of movies nowadays use techniques from him. they way he used weather to set atmosphere and mood , the Rashomon's effect , transition between the scenes etc i can talk about this movie all day long and it still wont be enough it's a movie for generations..... a true masterpiece of cinema",Seven Samurai
309,Reel07,"A masterpiece, yet to be imitated over the years",9,17 August 1999,"This is truly a timeless classic. Great script, story, performances, music, direction, photography, etc. all around. Kurosawa is one of the greatest directors ever. The acting is very realistic and convincing. The story follows a group of poor villagers who hire samurai to fend off the brigands who are invading their crops. This is a great character study, with such humanity and different emotions circling around the whole film. Each samurai is different in it's own way. For a film to be this great and express it's emotions, it will have to be as long as 208 minutes (although the 141 minute version cuts out very important scenes). There is not one boring or pointless scene that I can recall from the director's cut DVD I've got. As great as this film is, it has been imitated in many films like Magnificent Seven, Reservoir Dogs, and Usual Suspects. This film will never wear out and will remain the polished, wondrous, breath-taking,  gripping epic  that it was when it first came out in 1954.",Seven Samurai

The depth of the characters and interaction between them is quite riveting. Kurosawa is a brilliant director and in this movie shows how far ahead of his time he was. The pace is surprisingly fast without you noticing it and you can't miss a minute of it. An impressive movie and now I'm looking for more Kurosawa. This is not for kids looking for mindless entertainment. Worth watching twice to get more from the plot and sub plots.,Seven Samurai

However, the film is so innovative in its storyline and technique that anyone who judges it based on modern standards is clearly missing the point of how a film should be judged.

314,Speedy_Lube,A Perfect Film,10,21 July 2002,"Having recently viewed and reviewed Citizen Kane, I found myself with the prospect of not liking a single black and white film. Since my confidence in my ability to review films fairly shouldn't depend on the color of a film, I was anxious to review a black and white film positively. I have found such a film.Seven Samurai. I had heard of it before, but never seen it. Now I am glad I did. Akira Kurasowa's ""classic"" is truly on of the great treasures of cinema. An amazing cast of characters in one of the greatest and most enthralling plots, often repeated, but never with quite the skill of this one (see A Bug's Life, Magnificent Seven).I find it odd that many people call this an action film. Such a title discredits Seven Samurai, because the word action has become so derogatory in recent decades. It is true this is a kind of war sotry, with great action to boot. But the strength of the film is not in the awesome battles or the well choreographed and well filmed action sequences. It is the large group of characters, each of which the audience cares about. And although these days many of the characters would be called stereotypes or archetypes, it is important to remember, that this is the film that made them so.
Seven Samurai is THE original. And it should be no surprise that so many films have copied it. Kurosawa and the cast are all geniuses who make this film what it is. Every single actor in the film is believable, inspiring, entertaining, and at the same time, fits in to the puzzle perfectly, knowing when to be noticed and when to not. The not-so-obvious star of the film, Kurosawa's amazing talent for frame composition, brings it all together in a way that no other could, or should.I have only one regret for this film, the fact that it is in black and white. What a beautiful film it would be in color, as every shot is an artwork itself. Everyone should see this film. Not just because it has ""action"" or because it is a ""classic."" Just because it is Seven Samurai.",Seven Samurai
315,azuremorningsky,The Magnificent Samurai,10,10 May 2010,"I had heard of seven samurai long before i ever saw the movie, which is not very surprising, few movies have such a high international reputation as seven samurai. After watching the film it was easy to see how the movie got its reputation. Seven samurai has one of the most powerful plots i have seen in a movie and the story is by far the best of any film i have seen. The movie registers strongly on the emotional level, able to get across the determination and sacrifice the samurai feel as they give their all to protect the village from bandits as well as the grief the farmers feel when confronted by the danger of being annihilated.Although it is a good movie there are a few cosmetic things that i feel could of been done differently. For instance seven samurai is one of the few samurai films that doesn't do much with the swordplay. Although i may feel this way due to being used to long choreographed fights. Secondly, the film could have trimmed out a little of the peasants wailing. The peasants tended to be over-dramatic in the film. From the very beginning the first scene with the villagers shows them crying after they discover the bandits plan to raid the village. Later when they cannot find a samurai to help them they cry, when the villagers lose the rice they were going to pay the samurai with they cry. These are just a few examples there are many more, i understand that the director has to show that the farmers are defenseless and totally dependent on the samurai but i also feel that there are too many scenes with the peasants wailing, i think that the movie could have been more powerful emotionally if there were less crying scenes. To be fair my feelings may be due to the cultural divide. If you enjoy this film i would recommend the Magnificent Seven and Yojimbo.",Seven Samurai
316,SoHo1,"Memorable, life-changing...",10,23 March 2005,"The Seven Samurai is the one and only film of Akira Kurosowa that I have seen by far. Well, it was pure masterpiece. A heavyweight piece of art, whose tones of realism and artistry reverberate the whole being of yours. I loved every moment of this oh-so-dear film just because I got to know more about Japanese history of living than I ever did before. I felt like I was embedded within the destitution of this isolated village which seemed to muster all its power and call for help but their cry would hardly reach the peak of the surrounding mountains.The movie made me feel like I was the one seeking help and that I was one of those who'd feel the happiest if granted that help. And, yes, I really was happy when the Seven Samurai agreed to grant help to that in-the-middle-of-nowhere village, because I felt that, apart of the villagers, I was the only witness of what was about to occur so soon. I was made to breathe the way the village did and I was made to exude the very same feelings the villagers did when it came to crucial moments for their future.There are so many great moments that would justify the film's being worth watching. The juxtaposition of power and poverty is so interesting that it seemed to me this was the key factor to loving this taped piece of Japanese life. The dignity of the family, the nobility of the Samurai and the fiendish cruelty of the bandits make up the triangle of success.",Seven Samurai

Plenty of action, the battle sequences are among the best ever filmed. The interaction between the players is amazing! And Toshiro Mifune!!!I saw this one before seeing the Magnificent Seven, and I must say this one is the real deal. I liked the remake, but the original is still the best. You know the plot, besieged villagers hire seven ronin (gunmen in the remake) to protect their village from bandits. The thing missing from the remake is the depth of the characterizations! One really cares about the fate of the samurai. Total three-dimensional work. Even the farmers aren't seen as weak, just desperate. And Toshiro Mifune!!!",Seven Samurai
318,sneakyshooter,"Visually Striking, And Ahead Of Its Time",9,22 January 2020,"For as long as I can remember, I've heard about Kurosawa's legendary influence on directors. I've always had his films on my watchlist, but I will admit the running times had scared me off. The other night I watched Seven Samurai as my first Kurosawa movie and I can say its hard to believe I waited so long.This film is really something special. I cant really say anything that hasnt been said before. But the way each scene is shot, the way the characters are developed, and how the story unfolds is all excellently crafted. The actors are all superb and if it wasnt in black and white, you could pass this movie off as being very modern.The samurai's steal the show in the best way possible, and you only end up wanting to know more about each of these men. They each seem to have a deep background and set of morales that they stick to, making them feel like real people.Sure, the action may not be as flashy, but its very realistic. There are no sword ""clanging"" sound effects, no fleshy stabbing noises. People are simply cut down in a brutally honest way.My only real complaint is that we never get to see or know any of the bandits. I understand why this was done, but the one scene where the leader kills two of his own for deserting was very interesting. I would have liked to see more of that, but I get that it was thought not to be important. It was shot more like a documentary almost, sticking with our heroes from start to finish.In conclusion, everybody should give this movie a watch. Its a great lesson in story telling and directing, as well as a fun and visually interesting film. I now see what all the hype was about.",Seven Samurai
319,r-downey1,A Truly Classic Piece of 20th Century Film Making!,10,21 April 2005,"It was just last mouth that I saw Seven Samurai for my first time after reading hundreds of other good fan comments about it on this site, so in the end I became far too curious about the film and had to watch it for myself to see what the great fuss was all about and I of course got the DVD. The first time I watched this work of art I was blown away with joy and amazement due to just how super director Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece really was and I only wished I had listened to everyone else's comments on the IMDb Site much sooner. In fact Seven Samurai was so good I had to watch it again the next night to get all the brilliant scenes of this epic tale into my mind forever. Then I watched it again last Saturday and only after viewing it for the third time do I feel worthy enough to comment on this early 1950's classic. Well to start, the story is wonderful, the acting is truly outstanding, the Japanesse locations are beautiful and the script is super. Kurosawa is without doubt one of the greatest directors that ever lived! THE STORY: I'm sure you're all familiar with the plot in Seven Samurai so I'll try not to go into too much detail. In sixteenth-century Japan a poor farming village under threat from an evil gang of ruthless bandits whose only desire is to steal their rice and barley crops every year decide to hire seven poor and hungry samurai to help train and protect them. This quest however does not seem an easy one due to having no real money to pay the fighters. Then they hire their first warrior the old but brave samurai Kambei Shimada who soon helps them find the other six strong men that they need. The farmers then head off back home to their village to await the arrival of their new guests. The next hour or so is great as we get to see the relationship between the farmers and samurai changing as they come to like each other much better and start to understand each others' differences. At first they are strangers who do not get along very well due to either, fear or misunderstanding each others' way of life. Great story lines here! THE ACTING: The actors in this film were truly outstanding as they each brought their character to life in an unbelievable way, as they delivered to us viewers many different humorous moments, exciting and gripping sequences and some very touching and emotional scenes. My favourite character from the movie was Kikuchiyo the wacky member of the warriors group who was not quite a real samurai but appeared it was his dream to become one as he insisted in coming back to the farmers village with the other six samurai to prove them wrong about him. His character changes dramatically through the film as when we first see him he appears to be a comical person who enjoys drinking and looking for adventure, then in later scenes we start to feel for him as we learn all about his past and how similar his background once was to all of the farmers, then we see him fight bravely in the battle against the bandits, so we then realise just how worthy he is of the name samurai and of the respect of the others. Wonderful performances from all the actors! THE LOCATIONS: The Japanesse landscapes in the movie are beautiful and create a peaceful scene to the story plus with the help from brilliant directing we get to see them from lots of different angles. One of the most beautiful pieces of Kurosawa's directing talents is when the samurai are travelling to the village and stop by a waterfall where they look down and see Kikuchiyo jump into the stream below to catch a fish for his dinner.THE SCRIPT AND DIRECTING: The writing for this film was excellent and really made it easy for us to understand all the characters. Akira Kurosawa is one of the best directors ever who did some great movies in the past but after seeing Seven Samurai there is no doubt in my mind that this was his all-time masterpiece. It's quite sad that he will not be making any more brilliant productions like this ever again. He is well up there with all the other world famous directors.OVERALL: This was truly the masterpiece of its time in the 1950's and is still by far one of the best films ever made even to this very day. Seven Samurai has stepped up from being a movie that I was curious about to my 2nd favourite film of all time and would suggest to all fans of classic films to see it. Overall Seven Samurai deserves nothing less than a full 10/10 gold stars.WATCH IT AS SOON AS YOU GET THE CHANCE TO!!!!!",Seven Samurai

Therefore they decide to secure their safety by finding seven samurai who would defend them.First, I would like to say that I have broken a few stereotypes after I have watched this movie. The facts that it is a long movie from the 50's, a Japanese one, and a black-and-white one, rejected me from watching it earlier. I got used to all of these facts pretty fast and just enjoyed this masterpiece.The simplicity of the plot easily bought my full attention, as well as occasional comedy parts which successfully broke the monotony and came as a refreshment. It is interesting finding out how Japanese people were living in those times and it is shown really well. You actually manage to pretend for a moment you have left our advanced world and became a part of their primitive village.I respected Kurosawa before I even watched any of his movies. I respect him even more now when I have watched this great classic and I will surely be looking for something else he directed. The reason why I did not give this movie a 10 is occasional bizarre cryings, runs, deaths, but that surely did not destroy the whole experience.",Seven Samurai

The reason I'm giving Seven Samurai thumbs down is not some puerile glee at trashing something wonderful . It's my honest opinion that most normal English speaking people will find this movie overly long , dull , and just not up to the standards set by modern movie making . Maybe a Movie Museum would be interested in "" Samurai "" but not me .

322,connorveenstra,Might be the greatest film ever made.,10,3 November 2017,"It's difficult to describe Seven Samurai because firstly it's a movie that is best experienced knowing nothing about it. Secondly, because it's so packed with things to talk about it's difficult to know where to start.The slow beginning and ridiculously long run time might turn some viewers off, but with enough patience you'll be rewarded with a rich, nuanced experience that few other movies can match. The film uses this slow, deliberate pace to flesh out the characters and explore the world in which they live until you're completely sucked in and invested.The camera work is fantastic, with every single shot being perfectly blocked, composed and lit. The costume and set design are all so perfect that you think you've just stepped into feudal Japan. The acting from the entire cast is amazing and the action scenes are superbly epic.The characters are all well fleshed out (some more than others) and you root for all of them throughout the film. The themes are heavy and dramatic: honor, romance, the selfishness of human nature, deconstruction of the samurai myth. The movie might also have the greatest climax of any film in history, perfectly paying off the last three and a half hours you just spent sitting in your chair.Seven Samurai is a masterpiece of filmmaking and is everything a movie should be: simple but complex.

324,bross3,Stands the test of time,9,8 November 1999,"There aren't many movies made as long ago as this one that don't seem dated at all.  It helps that the movie takes place in 16th century Japan (so there aren't cues such as cars or clothing to tip you off as to when it was made), but there is really very little that could be done to make this movie any better.  Kurosawa had all the necessary tools at his disposal.If this movie were made by Hollywood (today) it would've been crammed into about 120 minutes, had a lot of gratuitous scenes of men being impaled with bright red guts spewing out, and there would have been at least one ""explicit"" sex scene.  But none of that is really necessary for this great film and it is probably better without them.  The violence seems very real and not fakey like in some other older movies.Despite its length, this film was very gripping.  Midway through the first half I felt like it was going a bit slow, but it soon picked up and held me through the end.  The general formula has been used so many times before that I knew full well how it was going to end, but despite the lack of surprises I felt very involved and riveted to the screen.This really wasn't a dialog-driven film, and I didn't feel like conversations were all that impressive, but this may be mostly to do with the fact that I was reading the subtitles and not natively understanding the Japanese.  The actors all play their parts well, and it is surprising that I was able to keep track of so many characters and not feel confused at all. It didn't feel convoluted.The reason this film was great when it was made, it is great today, and it will continue to be great in the future is the fact that it keys in on universal themes that will always be present: the archetypal good vs. evil, honor, war, relations between men and women, parents and children, wives and husbands, individuals and their communities, and even attitudes that groups of professions hold for each other (military vs. farmers, for example).  I'm sure you can find many other themes to add to this list as you watch.I watched the 208 minute VHS version and haven't seen any others.  I can't imagine that the 141 minute version can feel like a coherent whole.",Seven Samurai

However, he marvellously develops the character of each samurai and the peasants.""Seven Samurai"" is a sophisticated film and it goes much deeper than the battle against bandits. Samurai and peasants were drastically different classes in ancient Japan. They did not and could not interact with each other. Interestingly, Kurosawa brings them together in ""Seven Samurai"". Peasants fought off bandits in order to survive. Samurai helped the bandits in pursuit for virtue and justice.What happened eventually? The seven samurai and the entire class were the ultimate losers. It gradually went extinct in Japan. Some of them lost their virtues and characters, becoming bandits. Some of them could not find a lord and live as ronin (wandering samurai). Peasants were the big winners. They continued to live their routine as is.Were the peasants good? I do not believe so. They robbed samurai and stole weapons from them. They were so selfish that they only care for themselves. Peasants living in houses on the other side of the river bank refused to evacuate. They were so narrow minded and near sighted that they were incapable of considering the need of the entire village.I can keep on writing about ""Seven Samurai"" (particularly the symbol and the meaning of guns) but I shall stop here. This film is truly classic. Its characters, plot, and themes are so meticulously developed and presented that I do not experience a boring moment. Each actor (e.g. Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura) and actress plays excellent roles too. Yes, it is three and a half hours long but I love every minute of it. If you think that you are a cinema lover, you must watch it. This film is old and it is black and white. However, it is so brilliant in all areas that many colour films cannot match. I strongly recommend people to purchase the DVD. Criterion releases a new edition this September. It is expensive but it is worth the money.",Seven Samurai

327,yamagata@virtual-markets.net,An excellent snap shot of 17th Century Japan,10,8 October 2005,"What I like most about this movie is not the timeless themes of a small band of intrepid heroes set against large numbers of evil doers in battle. I like it because it gives insight into the history and the culture of Japan. It examines the caste system that was in place in 17th century Japan and what were the prejudices of the time in each caste. It also captures the true essence of Japan as a country that was based on a rice economy. That is the heart and soul of the country. The worth of a lord was based upon rice from the land that he controlled.Of course what I wrote above is not what makes this movie a classic. View it yourself and be the judge. There are many people that think that this is one of the ten best motion pictures of all time. I can watch this movie over and over again and still be as entertained as the first time I saw it. An inane or inferior movie, I cannot stand to see it again, let alone a third time. This is my ultimate guide as to what is an excellent movie. This is an excellent movie.",Seven Samurai

Some people think that black/white movies are bad (because they are old) but its wrong. I have seen movies from the 50's, 40's, 30's and 20's that is extremely well done (Its films like: Nosferatu, Vertigo and Citizen Kane).And this movie (seven Samurai) is such a film. Even though its from 54, its still a masterpiece. It tells its story well, have great actors, and do not use time on some stupid special effects which doesn't have a part in the story. Some films (which are made today) spend a lot of money on special effects, and shots of e.g. a female actor during bath. Seven Samurai is a movie that is slow and calm. The actors gets a lot of time to really act, and not just running around shooting or kissing most of the time. The actors gets to act a lot, and they do it well.I love this movie and i love it a lot. Its a movie that you can see again and again without being tired. you just have to watch this movie.",Seven Samurai
330,daniel-n-c180,as samurai-esque as it gets,8,6 December 2016,"The long and the short of it is this is a movie for the ages. Anyone who call themselves a cinephile ought to have watched this perforce. Gonna hit the high spots only 'cause boy do I despise those who in their review sum up the book's plot. If I need a synopsis I'll read the synopsis, people. First order of business- the length. I, personally , find the movie a trifle overly lengthy- 2h30 would've been perfect, the way I see it, and 1/3 of the movie was - let's call a spade a spade, shall we? - superfluous. Nothing really much happens in the movie. Everybody knows it all boils down to seven samurai endeavoring to put themselves out for a village of farmers, so we might just as well cut to the chase. If it were a Hollywood movie the same content would have to be fit in half the length of this one or less, namely 1h30, 1h45. This isn't to say that you shall squander time watching this one. But the action is indeed rather slow-paced, anyhow. Again, I'm not gonna make any bones about it- I take it that what accounts for the relative renown of the movie is the fact that it's a portrayal of a world ever so unknown to the European or American people -which makes it all the more glamorous. It outstrips in frankly no way whatever numerous American movies-apart for the setting. The setting metamorphosed an average-goodish movie in an exceptional one.But leaving off slinging mud at it, I must say one's gotta hand it to ""seven samurai"". When you get right down to it, its success is, plain as day, underlain by its setting- the Samurai's Japan beset by war and its corollaries- famine,poverty, death. That said, the movie does a jaw-dropping job at portraying the times. I don't want to downplay the acting of of the cast either as they are, if anything, first-rate actors and I watched them with great relish. A one-of-a-kind film. Literally.",Seven Samurai
331,pratyush-03848,How Action movies should be,9,17 November 2016,"There is no question why this movie is considered one of the finest movies of all time. Kurosawa's screenplay, direction and actors make this movie one that keeps you entertained rather than boring you out for 207 minutes, a rare feat for movies.The story is a village fears it will be pillaged by bandits in the future. So to protect themselves, they get the help of a group of samurais who train the people. Each samurai has a unique personality and contributes to the team in their own way. Each character is so well written that you feel that you know them in some way or can relate to them. My personal favorite is Toshiro Mifune as Kikuchiyo, the outsider of the group.Akira Kurosawa proved yet again why he is considered one of the greatest directors of all time in cinema. His screenplay and direction is unmatched as he keeps the viewer entertained from start to finish and keeps the story moving. The film is filled with action, drama, love, friendship and other themes that make it more than an adventure film. My recommendation to anyone out there is watch it as soon as you can, even if it may be a long movie. It is not one to miss.",Seven Samurai
332,Eddie C.,Quite possibly the best movie ever made.,10,6 January 1999,"Many film critics cite ""Citizen Kane"" as the best film ever made. Although ""Kane"" is a very good choice, an astute film student can learn just as much about the art of cinema from watching ""Seven Samurai"" and enjoy a much more exciting movie.I have seen this film many times on videotape and laserdisc. (God willing, I hope to get the DVD later this month.) While there are many things to praise about this film, I am expecially impressed with Kurosawa's attention to character. How many times in American blockbusters do we see cardboard characters that seem less like real people than stereotypes? In this film, not only are each of the samurai distinct individuals, but the farmers are also real people too. They aren't just victims that need to be rescued--they take an active role in the defense of their village, and once battle-trained, are just as brave and heroic as the samurai. Because Kurosawa gives us the time to get to know the characters, each death affects us all the more.A final word about the actor Toshiro Mifune. When he died in 1997, many commentators called him the ""John Wayne"" of Japan. Mifune would have been honored, but he was more gifted and versatile than Wayne ever was. In this film, his character first seems like a buffoon--you almost wonder if ""Kikuchiyo"" is supposed to be a comic relief for the other ""real"" samurai. But as the action get more serious, ""Kikuchiyo"" changes and ones appreciation for Mifune grows. There is a speech Mifune makes about the nature of farmers and samurai that is so moving, it should have won him an Academy award if this had been an English language film. As it stands, the loss belongs to the Academy, not to Toshiro.",Seven Samurai
333,Eddie C.,Quite possibly the best film ever made.,10,2 January 1999,"I have several laserdiscs at home (I only recently purchased a DVD player)and many are films that I see occasionally when I first buy them, then never see them again for a long time. The CAV version of Seven Samurai is a film that draws me back time and time again. It's a damn shame too many people refuse to see it because it isn't in English! I taped a copy for my cousin in New Jersey, and although I gave it my highest recommendation, he still has not seen it to this day.It's easier to focus on the few flaws of this film than to try to pinpoint what makes this film great. Katsushiro still seems incredibly wimpy for a samurai, and if you see this film in an art-house theatre the subtitles may not be as good as the ones on the Criterion version. It disturbed me that Rickichi's wife would rather commit suicide than come home to her husband--it wasn't HER fault the bandits kidnapped and raped her.But that's about it for naysaying. Not only are the action scenes terrific, but Kurosawa does a great job establishing the character of the samurai and peasants. You don't see a villain with a dynamic personality (as in ""The Magnificent Seven"") but Kurosawa is more interested in the relationship between the samurai and the peasants. One of the things the viewer learns is that many peasants think of samurai (in general) as merely bandits with higher breeding. The villagers are not saintly victims in this film, and the samurai are not superhuman swordsmen. Because the viewer gets to KNOW the characters in this film, their deaths have a greater impact than they do in the American version.If you haven't seen this film before, I both pity and envy you. I pity that you haven't been fortunate enough to see this film before, but I envy the fact that you will soon see it for the first time.",Seven Samurai

335,Hannibal_Chigurh,The Greatest Epic of All Time,10,26 October 2007,"Akira Kurosawa is perhaps the most important director of all time. His work has inspired future directors, writers, and even genres of film. Among his many cinematic triumphs, Seven Samurai reigns supreme. Kurosawa took his love of John Ford Westerns and mixed the ideals presented in those films with the samurai culture that he is descended from. Rather than draw from the noble myths that surround samurai, he used historical fact. Samurai after the fall of the feudal system became no separate from thieves, rapists, and bandits. This is a far cry from the romantic tales associated with them (the same holds true for knights in the Old World).The opens with bandits coming across a village that they recently raided. In order to maximize their loot, they decide to come back once the peasants have had time to grow more crops. The farmers know that the bandits will come and a small group vow to fight back. They travel to a nearby city looking for ronin (masterless samurai) to recruit to lead the farmers. The samurai must be willing to work for only rice, for the farmers can't pay and no glory can be gained from this. The farmers hope to find four. Instead, seven volunteer for this fight. The most important are Kambei (the wise and experienced sage), Katsushiro (the youngest of the bunch and the only one whose dreams have not yet died), and Kikuchiyo (the off-kilter fighter who technically is not invited to join the group). Kikuchiyo is played by the incomparable Toshiro Mifune, who gives the character a wacky zaniness mixed with a heartfelt desire to be accepted. It is he who breaks the tension between the samurai and the peasants. Farmers have learned to fear samurai, while the ronin are outraged that peasants kill samurai if they get the chance. Kikuchiyo knows that the peasants do this because of all the atrocities that samurai have committed over the years.The action sequences in the last third of the film were the most epic action scenes of their time. It has proved the foundation of the action genre with a grand battle to defend the village. Mifune swings his sword with such passion that in some places if you pause the film the blade disappears.While the film is 3 1/2 hours long, Kurosawa presents the story in such a way that time flies. I've never seen a film that long that felt so short. The character development that the three main samurai and the peasants go through is astonishing. You actually care when someone dies because you've seen them for so long and you've gotten to know the characters in and out. Killer action, even better acting, and masterful pacing and direction make this one of the ten best films you'll ever see.",Seven Samurai
336,annomy,Brilliant...,10,29 June 2003,"When I first read about the movie on the IMDb Top 250 movies and saw that it holds the 8th position, I started digging about that movie. after reading the plot, I found out that I've already seen 2 versions of that movie (American and Arabic). That made me hesitate to watch it but I bought the DVD at last and SAW the Masterpiece. It's a MUST for every collection.At first I was expecting to see lots of action(boy was I wrong) having the Hollywood version in mind. And I was also looking for similarities between the original and the remakes. As time went by, I found myself sitting through the whole movie enjoying every second of the 3.5 hours movie.The story was so strongly built and the characters were very well defined and smoothly developed. Like the way that Kikuchiyo (played by the brilliant Toshirô Mifune) acts like the ice-melting joint between the farmers and the samurai and yet shows great courage defending and saving the farmers. There is also Kambei, the leader of the 7 samurai. He really looks like a real leader with great wisdom and patience. And the list goes on and on. Basicly all of the cast played their parts honestly well.The direction is brilliant. I didn't watch many Kurosawa movies but I think that no director can surpass the work done in Seven Samurai(1954). I wonder what might it look if today's technology was available back then.I gave this movie 10/10. if there was 20/10 then that's for this one. If it's up to me, then I'd put it up next to The God Father.",Seven Samurai
337,sourav894,Magic meets art,10,27 December 2011,"If there is one film by which Kurosawa is recognized by, it is Seven Samurai, and it rightly deserves its place! One of the richest works to ever be committed to celluloid, each of its characters is extraordinarily realized; each has his or her own arc, his or her own vital part to play in the film's slow progression towards its dramatic finale.What really stands out in Seven Samurai are its characters. They run the gamut, from elder teacher to hopeful youth, stoic warrior to undisciplined brigand. Kurosawa even finds room for a youthful romance. No wonder enemy bandits are virtually faceless. There is so much conflict and passion present within the group of our beloved protagonists, the villains need not be more than a vague threat! The run length of the film is its biggest strength- a rare claim, indeed! With a large canvas, Kurosawa painted something that will define cinema till the end of mankind!",Seven Samurai
338,belikemichaeldotcom,"Over-rated film; OK, but not great",6,31 January 2004,"When I saw that this film was one of the top rated IMDB films, I had to see it.   Overall, it was a decent movie, but I failed to recognize its greatness.  It was way too long (3+ hours) and it was just a simple story, decently acted and, well, kinda blah.  Maybe my hopes were set too high, but when I finally saw ""Bicycle Thief"", that film completely lived up to its praise, as do most of the other top rated films I've seen (although ""Casablanca"" is another extremely overrated flick).I don't know, maybe it's a Kurosawa thing or maybe it's us westerners simply amazed at the mystique of the Samurai.  Who knows?  It's not a bad film -- in fact it was somewhat enjoyable.  If you have a few extra hours to spare, pick it up on video, but as for me, I'd rather catch some of the more deserving top films.Rating: 6/10",Seven Samurai
339,dxia,A real action movie,10,18 February 2004,"The most enduring and memorable parts of the 'Seven Samurai' are the inspiring battle scenes and seiges, but the interesting part is that they do not rely on special effects. The realism of the action is what makes it fascinating. The attacks are obviously well choreographed by Kurosawa and his stunt coordinator, but the movie does not rely on fancy sword fights or heavy charges. In fact, many of the individual feats of the samurai are implied through the storytelling.What makes the movie so wonderful is its attachment to reality. The characters are not superhuman, and thus they seem all the greater because of what they lack. They fight for an unworthy cause with no pay, not because they want to save their employers (in fact, they don't even particularly like them) but because it is the way of the samurai. It is an example of true nobility in a genre so diluted with false bravery. It's a wonder why Tom Cruise's 'The Last Samurai' did not take this movie's example.",Seven Samurai

341,londonscot2003,Greatest film of all time,10,1 December 2013,"Akira Kurosawa made ""Seven Samurai"" because he wanted to make a real ""jidai-geki,"" a real period-film that would present the past as meaningful, while also being an entertaining film. Kurosawa considered ""Rashomon,"" the film rightfully credited with making the West aware of the Japanese cinema, with being neither. But in his attempt to make a truly ""realistic"" film, Kurosawa redefined the conflict at the heart of Japanese films. Before ""Seven Samurai"" this conflict was that of love versus duty, where the central character is compelled by fate to sacrifice what he loves in the name of duty. In ""Seven Samurai"" the focus remains on duty, yet the conflict is now between the real and the pretended. Calling yourself a samurai does not make you one, something proved time and time again in the film, from the test of skill turned deadly between Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi) and the tall samurai to the first appearance of Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune), with his stolen pedigree. Like Katshushiro (Ko Kimura), the youngster who wants to learn from the master, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), the audience is educated as to the true nature of the samurai.For me this film deals with the heroic, albeit in realistic terms. I have shown the film in World Literature classes, after students have read Homer's ""Iliad"" and as they begin reading Cervantes' ""Don Quixote."" Within that context, compared to the brutal arrogance of Achilles and the gentle insanity of Quixote, the heroic qualities of the seven samurai become clear. Their inspiration extends to some of the villagers. Manzo (Kamatari Fujiwara) is crazed with fear over the virtue of his daughter, Shino (Keiko Tsushima), and Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya) fights to avenge the disgrace of his wife and his precipitating the death of Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki), but it is the comic Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari), who finds within himself the ability to fight, a die a tragic death, who is the true barometer for what the samurai mean to the village. But the greatest tragedy is that despite this most noble effort and the bodies buried in honor at the top of the village cemetery, this has been but a temporary union between the villagers and the samurai. When Kambei declares, ""We have lost again,"" he redefines the battles: it was not to kill all the bandits, it was to find a true place in the world. Yet we should have already known this, for the painful truth was driven home when Kyuzo, the master swordsman, is gunned down from behind. No better proof is needed in this film of the bitter truth that the world is not fair.Mifune is the maniacal spirit of this film, as the faux-samurai Kikuchiyo, the dancing whirlwind whose emotions overwhelm everything including himself. But it is Shimura as Kambei, who embodies the mentor mentality with a minimum of effort, evoking more by rubbing his hand over his shaved head or giving a single piercing look than by any spoken dialogue. Even in a strong ensemble these performances stand out, for clearly different reasons. To fully appreciate Kurosawa's mastery in ""Seven Samurai"" you need to watch the film several times to better appreciate the way he constructs scenes, using contrasting images, evocative music and varying the length of cuts to affect tempo. For example, look carefully at how the early scene of the farmers searching the streets for samurai and the later sequence where Katsushiro watches Kyuzo and Kikuchiyo waiting for the bandit scouts to return to their horses. Both of these scenes are superb primers to Kurosawa's style.For years we had to put with the 160-minute version of the film that was made for export, which was actually called ""The Magnificent Seven"" until John Strugis's Western remake. Fortunately, ""Seven Samurai"" has been restored to full 208-minute glory, saved from being a lamentable cinematic tragedy on a par with ""Greed,"" ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" and ""Ivan the Terrible."" There is a sense in which ""Seven Samurai"" is truly my favorite film, because it was the one that instilled in me a love of cinema, of the craft and art of movie making, of compelling me to understand intellectually how Kurosawa was skillfully manipulating my emotions. The final battle sequences, fought and filmed in a torrent of rain, exhausting characters and audience alike with its increasingly relentless tempo, is given its potency because of the human elements that have been established in all that has taken place before hand. ""Seven Samurai"" is a magnificent film against which the vast majority of epics pale in comparison. Not even Kurosawa scaled these heights ever again.",Seven Samurai
342,dc_follies,So So,4,14 March 2005,"I decided to check out Seven Samurai after reading the rave reviews on this site and being exhausted with all of the lack of quality that Hollywood seems to give us from year to year. I can enjoy most styles of movies, with the notable exceptions of the love story/chick flick and slasher movies, so the samurai genre is an available genre for me. The movie was okay, but not great. Three and a half hours is much too long for a relatively simple story without truly deep character development that gets you far into any one of their minds, perhaps because of the large number of ""main"" characters. The result for me was that I couldn't genuinely care about many, if any, of them. The cinematography, I felt, was average, especially for an ""action"" movie - this is what separates Citizen Kane by leaps and bounds from Seven Samurai (also check out the first 3.5 minute, no-cut shot in Touch of Evil). I need to go back and watch this film again, but do not have high hopes for the return trip. Again, the film was decent, but definitely not worth the accolades that it has received on IMDb.1-11-06 Okay, I have seen it again and am not impressed.

345,Danarella,Epic,10,10 May 2010,"Seven Samurai opens with a group of bandits picking out a small village to rob and destroy. The village has been suffering and they do not have the capability to defend themselves. After much deliberation, some villagers insist that they need to hire Samurai in order to survive. Most of the men in the village are opposed, if only out of fear that their women will be stolen.Director Akira Kurosawa does a fine job of creating the tension in the village and showing that they have no way out of their dilemma. He also does an interesting job of introducing the characters. The samurai are introduced one by one as the men beg for help. This section of the film is a little too long; because since the film is titled Seven Samurai, we know that the men are going to be able to get seven samurais to help them.After the samurais go to the village, they begin to train the villagers to protect their village and to forget about their individual belongings. This section is very well done and builds discord for the anticipation of the attack from the bandits. When the bandits finally attack in the last third of the film, the audience has connected with the characters. The problem with the characters is that some of the samurai look alike and their names are similar if you are unfamiliar with Japanese names.The most notable part of the film is the set and costume design. The film seems to actually take place in a 15th century village. Overall the film creates a fantastic plot arc with interesting character archetypes.

346,moviesdirectorarmy,Kurosawa's cinematic tour de force,10,20 September 2006,"Akira Kurosawa's infatuation for Japanese culture is undeniably palpable, the majority of his films are period pieces that of which are usually based on tales of the samurai. In Seven Samurai Kurosawa creates a rather simplistic story of domestic turmoil and the relations of men. Akira Kurosawa has firmly established himself as one of the most vital film makers in the history of cinema and Seven Samurai is not only his triumph but also a film that's constantly observed both by critics and directors alike as a reference on how an epic should be told. As grand as the battles are in Seven Samurai it's the character's eccentricities that will leave the viewer with a vicarious sense of subconscious ecstasy. My conclusion of Seven Samurai is this, a film of true beauty one that delicately balances it's tragic notion on post war with humour and subtlety in addition to that Seven Samurai speaks a universal language and deciphers the message of the foundations of friendship and courage.",Seven Samurai

349,cutsman-2,THE Action Epic.,10,1 May 2010,"Is there any movie more epic than this? Clocking in at three and a half hours, Kurosawa's tale of Samurais assisting a ""helpless"" village is a masterpiece. The story itself is rather simple but doesn't lack depth. It serves as an entrance into the lives of the people you will spend the next 3 and 1/2 hours with. A village of farmers is continually attacked by a group of bandits, robbing them of their crops. The villagers get the idea to hire Samurai to protect them from the bandits. They cannot pay much, a place to stay and a bowl of rice a day, but a group of Samurai still go to help the village, seven to be exact. There they create plans of attack and train the villagers. When the bandits do finally show up it is a battle to the death. Now there is a bit more going on here, but if you're going to invest in the film you don't want to be spoiled.The story is like a classic western, which of course we all know it was remade into The Magnificent Seven, but unlike earlier Westerns during Hollywood's golden age, this Samurai's have depth. Each individual warrior has his own motivations, personalities, and outlooks on life. Which is important because this film is rather pessimistic. There is an air of distrust that lingers throughout the movie, a feeling of unwelcome from both the villagers and the Samurai. This was probably on purpose as Kurosawa was likely showing the strains in class during that era. The action sequences in the film are outstanding; they have a kinetic energy to them but flow. Flow like poetry, unlike the jarring jump cuts of today's films, Kurosawa lets the camera linger and you get the sense of training and mastery of the Samurai. One slight problem is that the film's best action sequence is in the first thirty minutes, leaving you waiting the rest of the film for a sequence that matches it. Overall, there really shouldn't be any doubt that you need to see this movie. If you love film, you must watch Seven Samurai.",Seven Samurai
350,manjavhern,Great samurai movie!!,10,10 May 2010,"I saw Seven Samurai for my film history class and was greatly pleased in seeing it. To see the movie that started off so many other cult classics such as the magnificent seven is very moving. The film itself is greatly done with so much going on in the three hours it runs. Yes that is correct three hours! It is a long movie to watch but very well shot. The movie is in subtitles, which does take away from seeing the movie fully, but it is much better than having horrible voice-overs. The movie is also in black and white. The movie is full of deep emotional moments as well as comedic lifting scenes. They are blended well together to keep the viewer interested and entertained. The movie drags on a bit, but it does give you much information about each samurai and the lives they live. The movie also shows the impact and change in each warrior and the villagers. The love relationship between the samurai and the villager was a bit of an annoyance but bearable. The end battle is very well done with many awesome battle scenes and deaths. I was very surprised with the arrow and sword battles, they were well done and very believable. Even in today's movies they aren't done half as good as they were done in this film. The last epic battle costs many lives but does serve its purpose and symbolism. The end of the movie with the samurais contemplating the cost of their actions and their lives is very moving and deep. This is one film every action buff and movie goers must watch at least one time in their life. You will not be disappointed. After watching the movie, go and read the BFI film classics book of Seven Samurai for a great deal of insight and information to enhance your experience.",Seven Samurai
351,Keltxangel,Seven Samurai,6,7 May 2010,"Although this film seemed to be a little bit too long, I found it visually appealing. It also had many elements; it was dark, funny, romantic, and action packed. Though there were some serious moments, there was always a little bit of humor in the movie. For example, I really enjoyed the older man that was always in the hut, he seemed to not really have a purpose except to lighten the mood a little bit since everything else was so serious. Another aspect I enjoyed was the relationship between the soldier and the young woman from the village. They seemed to truly be in love, when she thinks that they may never see each other again. Once the battle is over, though, the young woman goes back to her old life and seems to not be affected by this young man and therefore shows that she was never in love with him in the first place.",Seven Samurai

Three hours and one is sorry it is over. The Godfather has the same feature, but I don't ever watch the Godfather clear through as (in my opinion) the great character development is at the very beginning, and only with Marlon Brando's character.Seven Samurai has the most efficient character development I can think of. The introduction of Kambei Shimada as the leader is brilliant. Saving a baby from a villain. How good is that! The introduction of Kyuzo as the swordsman is quiet and brief and unbelievably compelling as is his further participation in the story. I liked the brief introduction of the other characters as well.The camera work and photography, some of it moving, are themselves moving. I can see another remake, maybe ""The Muslim Brotherhood,"" where seven tribal outcasts save the day. ""The Magnificent Seven"" was an entertaining remake, but hard to view once one has seen the original.",Seven Samurai

I love Bruce Lee films and Steven Segal films as well but cannot fathom why these films are so popular. Give me Jackie Chan any day over this dribble. Why isn't Enter The Dragon up above these artsy pieces of garbage. Why not Pokeman for that instance at least there is some humor in that. I would rather watch Dragon Ball Z, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, The Fist of the North Star both versions, Blood Sport even Ultimate Fighting Championship six over this set of movies.

354,ensiform,Perfect,10,18 August 1999,"The best foreign film ever made?  Perhaps.  Every scene is classic, every nuance perfect.  The plot of this movie is very much in the American Western tradition.  A small village of farmers is being plagued by bandits, and they hire some ronin, or masterless samurai, to protect them.  All they can afford to pay the samurai is three meals a day, so it's a tricky situation. Even in the complete, three-and-a-half-hour long version, this film's action never flags for an instant.  The fight scenes are the most grandiose, dramatic and emotional I've seen (one of the few movies that makes the viewer actually care when the characters die).  It's also very subtle, with the viewer's sympathies being directed and re-directed as a new aspect of each of the characters comes to light.  The ""wild"" samurai's vindictive speech is a good example.  This is really a perfect movie.",Seven Samurai

357,Imaginist,Seven Samurai (5/5),10,26 February 2006,"Synopsis: ""Seven Samurai"" is the story of seven samurais (duh) who are hired by poor farmers to protect their village from pillaging bandits. This is Akira Kurosawa's finest film and it is probably the first modern action flick ever made. The film begins quite slowly as we watch several farmers recruit samurai warriors to come to their aid. This takes up the first half of the three hour long movie, and at times it can become a bit boring. However, this phase of the film is absolutely necessary. It allows Kurosawa to introduce each of his beloved characters and flush them out in full detail.As soon as the viewer starts to wonder where all the supposed ""action"" is, he is delighted to find that the last half of the feature is an extravagant battle between the forces of good (the samurais and villagers) and evil (the bandits). It is here that Kurosawa really shows his skill. He invents the ""final climatic battle sequence"" that we see in every action film made after this one. The battle is a rush, and because we know and love the characters we can truly appreciate the conflict; we worry about their well-being. As one might have guessed, the heroes are successful and the small village survives the siege, but it is not without a heavy price: there are many who die. Of course, we only care for the heroes who die, not for the villains. We scarcely know these marauding bandits; they are simply nameless enemies. At first, one might see this as a weakness in the story. It appears to be a simplistic way of looking at the world: only the good guys are human and the evil folks are just mindless minions. However, I believe that this is an appropriate choice on Kurosawa's part. Although it is true that the people we often label as villainous or evil have a good side to them, this film's purpose is to focus solely on heroic individuals. This is Kurosawa's tribute to the selfless and perhaps reluctant hero.""Seven Samurai"" is a cinematic masterpiece. Kurosawa masterfully blends characters, story, camera techniques (every shot is carefully constructed and adequately done), and music to create one of the most influential films ever conceived. Kurosawa is a true master of his craft and this is his tour-de-force. ""Seven Samurai"" rightly deserves: 5 out of 5 stars.",Seven Samurai

360,Shnorg2342,Seven Samurai- Kurosawa's masterpiece,9,24 November 2019,"Seven Samurai is one of the best epics ever made, and some consider it to be the first action movie. While that may not necessarily be the case, it definitely invented many stereotypes now common in action films, such as the wide old leader, the brash rogue, the funny one who lifts the teams moral, the silent skilled one, and so on. This film was a pioneer in terms of story structure, character structure, cinematography, and editing. The film is about a village, and their solution to one of the citizens overhearing bandits plans to attack them come harvest season. Plagued with this issue, the member of the village consult the village elder. He tells them that in his time, the villages that were able to afford samurai protectors survived. The village is very poor, and can only pay the samurais in food and shelter. This means they have to rely on those samurai kind enough, or starving enough, to risk there lives for food. They end up with seven samurai, as the title suggests. 4/7 are very inexperienced. After the samurais train the villagers in the art of war, a few battles commence. During these battles many bandits, villagers, and 4 of the samurai lose their lives. It is a grim tale. 2 of the samurai are old friends, who fought in the army together. It is mentioned at the beginning of the film that they never won a battle, but somehow they both managed to survive. The movie ends with one of these two's grim realization that the same has happened here. Only the 2 war buddies and one's apprentice survived. It is also realized that while many villagers won, the samurai were doomed to lose either way.",Seven Samurai

My personal favorites came from the characters of Kambei, Kikuchyo and Kyuzo. If whoever's reading this has not seen this movie, see it! If you have seen it, see it again!

364,hypathio7,Mud Replaces the Splatter of Blood,10,29 November 2014,"I just saw a restored print of this on the big screen with newly translated subtitles. I had forgotten how long it was (with an intermission). It is more about slowly revealing the characters and saving the big action sequences for the end. I really enjoy the outdoor setting as well. I think I've mentioned it in other reviews, but there is something so beautiful about the forest. The hills surrounding the small village are magnificently captured, the wind blows, the dust is stirred up, and when it rains, the mud replaces the splatter of blood. The movie starts with a lot of slow steady drum beats for accompaniment and culminates with the rapid patter of sandaled feet and pounding hooves of the attacking bandits' horses.The story takes its time as four peasants led by Rikichi (Tsuchiya) go to town to enlist the help of samurai for the defense of their village. Samurai are born into privilege, can read and write and enjoy leisurely arts, and are generally proud of their social standing and skill. They finally find the good-hearted and intelligent Kambei (Shimura). Two other samurai are watching Kambei too. Katsushiro (Kimura) is a young man who immediately has great respect for Kambei and requests to be his disciple. Kikuchiyo (Mifune) is boisterous and intrigued by the more clever man, but expects Kambei to give him respect and acceptance automatically. The other samurai are gathered once Kambei agrees to the peasants' proposal. Toshiro Mifune is such a treat when he appears again drunk, trying to claim upper-class lineage, and wildly trying to prove some skill to the other six who only laugh. Toshiro's performance might seem over done, he's such a ham. I couldn't accept his wildly different style when I first saw this movie, but I grew to love him. Having seen him in some others pictures by now, I was totally with him during this viewing. He adds much needed humor. The story continues slowly as Kambei leads a careful defense plan to protect the four sides of the village. Meanwhile, the villagers ""piss and cry"" at every little thing and try to learn from the samurai how to use spears to defend themselves. Katsushiro has a romantic subplot with Shino, one of the peasants' daughters. Backstories are revealed about a couple of the other peasants and about where Kikuchiyo came from. Finally the bandits attack! And Kambei methodically checks off the chart on his map as they lessen the bandits' numbers. It's a very controlled, but impressive, and close battle as the villagers fight for their lives with the strategic leadership of the samurai.",Seven Samurai
365,coolsharpharp,For the purists,8,26 February 2006,"The initial scenes in the film show the suffering that a village is suffering at the hands of looting bandits. The level of deprivation and poverty which the peasants are made to endure makes Dickens Victorian world seem like a paradise in comparison. The director Kurasowa creates a totally believable view for what sixteenth century Japan must have been like.The villagers enlist the help of a samurai called Kambei who in turn persuades another six samurai to join him in the protection of the village. The samurai train the villagers to defend themselves and their village. The village is poor and cannot afford to pay their noble protectors. Do the samurai help for honour and glory? The question is left open ended in the film. You are left to ask yourself why each samurai would be willing to put their life on the line? One of the samurai is no samurai at all and he is by far the most interesting character in the film. Kikichiyo is the son of a farmer whose village had been destroyed by marauders while he was still a child. He impersonates a samurai to empower his self-image and stop feeling sorry for himself. He is extremely bold, brave and is the cause for many humorous moments during the film.The villagers are portrayed in various lights. They are initially the subject of pity and sympathy as their plight seems so awful. On the other hand, when the honourable samurai first come to their village they are give them no welcome. However, they plead for the samurai's help when they are scared of a possible bandit attack. This makes them seem inhospitable, selfish and extremely ungrateful. There are revelations that the villagers stole from and murdered defeated samurai. There is also evidence that they are not as poor as they pretend. However, the villagers fight well in the end and reclaim their village under the guidance of the samurai.The final scene is powerful but ambigous as Kambei says to his surviving comrades that the samurai have been defeated but the villagers were victorious. Does he mean the loss of the fallen samurai was too high a price to pay for the liberation of the village. Alternatively, after having fought the battle has he come to a realisation that the village was not worth saving? It could be possible that he was envious of the village rejoicing with new hope, while the samurai had gained nothing but the memory of fallen friends. It is impossible to say what he meant and that is the beauty of the ending. It is left for the viewer to decide and that is the way it should always be. This is a true classic and is highly recommended to those who know what it means to be a film fan.",Seven Samurai
366,iamookay,Masterpiece,8,9 January 2018,I love the authenticity and realism of this movie. It might be a tad long compared to today's standard but there is no wasted scene. I love the characterizations and the stories of each of the seven samurai.,Seven Samurai
367,talexander12599,An Essential Piece of Japanese Film,8,5 October 2015,"Seven Samurai is a Japanese historical drama from 1954. It was written and directed by Akira Kurosawa (Yojimbo, Rashomon, Ran). It was also written by Shinobu Hashimoto (Rashomon, Ikiru, Throne of Blood) and Hideo Oguni (Ran, Tora! Tora! Tora!, Ikiru). It stars Takashi Shimura (Ikiru, Rashomon, Throne of Blood), Toshirô Mifune (Rashomon, Yojimbo, Throne of Blood) and Isao Kimura (High and Low, Ikiru, Stray Dog). Seven Samurai is about the samurai (Takashi Shimura, Toshirô Mifune, Isao Kimura) hired to protect a small village from oncoming raiders and how they prepare the town and ultimately fight for it.Akira Kurosawa is one of the most famous of all foreign directors for a reason. He has a way of composing his shots that is like no other. Every image in this film is a painting. His ability to truly put you in 16th century Japan is far superior to the Hollywood directors attempting to make an epic period piece. Watch this film if you want to see what Japan used to not only be like but felt like.I feel if Takashi Shimura wasn't Japanese but American and had the same amount of talent he would be spoken in the same breath as Jimmy Stewart, Paul Newman and many other incredible 50's actors. It's a shame he isn't that recognized because his talent is incredible. I don't speak Japanese but this man transcends language. In this film, you believe every aspect about him and all of his small mannerisms. He truly feels like a real person.Why I do think this is a really good film and everybody should watch it, I feel as if it is slightly overrated. Many filmmakers declare this as one of the best films of all time, I wouldn't consider it in the top 50. It is a bit too long (3 and a half hours), and could definitely use some cutting. This doesn't mean it is necessarily boring and maybe I just don't fully understand it and will take a few more viewings to understand. However I do still highly admire this film and you should spend a day and watch it.",Seven Samurai
368,Kanadiz,It's directors like Akira Kurosawa that turn a film into something worth cherishing the rest of your life!,9,11 June 2008,"The Seven Samurai is an example of film making at its highest level. It is the first film I've seen of Akira Kurosawa; I saw it for the first time in my first year of college. It's also the first film that comes to mind when I think of Kurosawa and not to mention Akira Kurosawa is one of my all-time favorite directors. It is also the film that at he will be remembered for.The story begins in Japan in the early 1600's with a poor town being robed, raped and murdered by bandits. The bandits then come to the town again but decide to visit the town when the barley has fully grown. One of the town members finds out it's going to be robbed again and of course tells the town the disturbing news.The town of course is absolutely terrified and are in a state of panic and don't know what to do. Some wish to just give the bandits their food and beg them to leave them enough food to last them the winter. Some wish to kill themselves since they cannot stand this life of sorrow and pain. But a few wish to take a stand and fight back. They then take it up with the eldest member of the town and agrees to fight back but since they are farmers and do not know how to fight, he tells them to hire samurai. But the town is a very poor town so he tells the people to find 'hungry' samurai, samurai that will work for a sum of three meals a day.This film is so exquisitely made that it ranks as possibly one of the greatest films ever made. It has such superb scenes especially the final battle scenes in the heavy rain, such beauty on screen words cannot describe. There is also another beautiful sad scene where the two leading actors Kambei & Kikuchiyo (Takashi Shimura & Toshirô Mifune) find a mother who has been murdered but she has saved her new born son and Kikuchiyo holds the boy and starts to cry ""This is me this is exactly what happened to me!"" That scene always brings tears to my eyes.Like many other Kurosawa film, it has inspired other films such as he terrific western remake of this film (the American version of 'The Seven Samurai') called 'The Magnificent Seven' from 1960 which is also a great film. It stared Yul Brynner and the great Steve McQueen in the role that made him a star. The film also to some extent influenced 'The 13th Warrior' as well as it also shares the main idea of hiring men to save a town, in this case, Vikings and one Arab.I have also heard that Steven Spielberg, one of our finest directors who gave us such masterpieces as 'Schindler's List', 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' and many others watches this film every time he sets out to make a film of his own, along with three other great films, 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'The Searchers' & 'It's a Wonderful Life'.It's a script like this that makes a film like this a real treasure in any genre and it's directors like Akira Kurosawa that turn a film into something worth cherishing the rest of your life.",Seven Samurai
369,KiltsMcGee,Great stuff by often drags.,7,17 May 2015,"You want Samurai? We've got seven of them and they're all recognisable and nuanced in their own memorable way. As a side-note, I literally just looked up what the plural of the word Samurai was because I just wasn't sure. The embarrassing thing is that I really should have been sure considering I spent three and a half hours watching a film whose title has the pluralised form of Samurai displayed for the world to see. Clearly, I am not an observant person.I am not opposed to films being long as long as all the scenes within them at least seem necessary to the plot and characters. When your film has a black screen that says, 'INTERMISSION' on it, it's safe to say that you are pushing it a little. With a run time of 206 minutes Kurosawa's epic lives up to that weighty noun. While I could criticise it for being over-bloated, almost all the scenes were necessary to making the film what it is.The film has three long phases. The first phase is the formation of the titular Samurai boy band of death in their quest to protect a village of farmers from a barrage of bandits. Each of the characters has ample screen time devoted to them (which considering the amount of time available to assign). They are all full to brim with character; an important trait when considering the film is pre-colour. With the power to use colour to immediately recognise the characters stolen from the film, it is forced to use physical mannerisms to show which character is which at a glance that and silly hairstyles.I have never really understood Japan to its full extent and hopefully never will. Throughout the film, the statuses, jobs and relationships of farmers and Samurai are given. It was made very clear exactly the context of these historical occupations and how they interact with one another. I always thought that Samurai were the knights of feudal Japan. It seems, however, that they are more akin to today's mercenaries. The way that the contextual statuses are woven within the film adds to how believable the film is. I was taken by how little these characters seemed like actors playing roles and rather actual Samurai.It is important to mention the runtime once more. I know I may be lingering slightly but so did the movie so take it up with Akira Kurosawa. I you were using this review as a recommendation and weren't expecting a gargantuan epic; I honestly couldn't recommend this film to you. While it was an enjoyable story, it is not a film that I will ever willingly return to. There are huge pacing issues making the film often drag a black and white cinematic parachute.I would recommend you watch this film once. Mainly so that you can show off that you watched a 3+ hour film that isn't any of the Hobbit films (this is a much better film than any of those). The characters are some of the best put on film in history and the story is dense with plot. However, it did very well to deter me from a second viewing.",Seven Samurai

There's always something happening in the frame.Watching the movie, you'll find yourself getting more immersed as you go an, you feel the same nervousness that plagues the Seven Samurai. These tense feelings can lead into some explosive battles, that will cause you to get on the edge of your seat. The performances really help me look into each individual character and their role in the squad.

But then I thought about the emperor's new clothes. Somebody's got to cry ""Foul!""And ""Foul"" it was. Mind you, this is only my opinion. I respect your right to fall in with the majority who evidently think this film is the Cat's Pajamas. I did give it a 2 because it does have some good lines. And, after all, Shakespeare did say ""The play's the thing."" The story is a good story, though it too is not believable. We want to believe that hard-bitten professionals in any field of endeavor beneath it all have a heart of gold. And we might have too, had any of the character been believable. Not a one. I wanted to call it ""overacting"", but alas, it was just bad acting. Should I mention ""whiney-face""? Could an actual person have carried that expression around permanently?There were those who suggested that detractors didn't like the film because it was ""old"" or in ""black and white"". I watched this ponderous film last night because I thought I should. I was prepared to be enthralled. James Coburn said he watched this film 12 times in 12 days. That was enough for me. By the time the film was mercifully over, I wondered who had been holding a gun to his head for those 12 days.I like old. I like black and white. I don't like bad. I especially don't like bad that so many have told me is good. So after I watched this last night, tonight I watched Jean Simmons in ""Home Before Dark"". Made in 1958 (only 4 years newer) and also in black and white. A ways into the movie, I suddenly realized that these two films could be compared on a basic filmmaking level. Jean Simmons can actually act. In fact, all of the supporting cast can act, too. The characters were believable. Maybe not in an actual sense but at least in the sense of ""suspended disbelief"". Can't do that with Seven Samurai. Much has been said of the fine score of Seven. No. Other than tribal drums, nothing seemed to fit. Just the opposite for Home. It had a score that really fit what was going on on the screen at the time.I could go on, but my rant is assuaged and I'm too tired to write more.For those of you who have not seen the film, the following is for you: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

Considering the movies we are used to nowadays, realized with enormously expensive equipment, effects, sets and actors, I'd say that here we see how a movie can be elevated, simply by the vision of the artists making it. The cinematography is fantastic and often ahead of its time. This is no surprise if we consider Kurosawa's early training as a painter. Some of the shots remain in your mind long after the film has ended. The intensity of the main actors is sometimes nearly overwhelming in their portrayal of the emotional spectrum of human beings. Anger, doubt, courage, disillusion, humor and friendship are among the emotions that we are confronted with continuously throughout the movie. In spite of the length of the film, the director keeps grabbing our attention and the only break allowed is a formal intermission mid-movie.

It's a very human movie, filled with drama that makes the 3 and a half hour running time seem shorter than some of the horrible action movies nowadays (take Bad Boys II for example) that are 1 or 1 1/2 hours shorter.Kurosawa has mastered the fact that actions speak louder than words.  And while many moments require little or no dialogue to get his point across, they do require emotion, facial expressions, and body language.  The dialogue assists these actions.  There is no need for explosions or overlong, final duals.In  Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai,"" the final dual is this: will the Samurai and the farmer girl (true love) be able to break past societal barriers?  Kurosawa's execution of this complex story ends up being far more thrilling and engaging than 99% of the new action movies being released 50 years later.",Seven Samurai

Melodramatic to the point of nauseating, I took nothing worth holding onto from this film.Major quibbles: What military strategist tells his/her army to drink sake and have sex the night before the final battle? How omnipotent the samurai were to foresee all the enemy's activities so completely....all except the last soldier making it into the barn with all the women folk. *shakes head* They could construct spears and elaborate fences, but not more bow and arrows? Did they not know to kill or maim the horses underneath the bandits rather than reaching way up to hit the soldiers themselves? Did the bandits not know how to cut their losses and look for the next easy-pickings village for plundering? Thankfully, I checked this out from a library so I wasn't out any money. I've watched other super highly acclaimed movies, and even if I didn't like those, I at least understood why they were acclaimed.

378,KALKevin,"Not just Kurosawa's best movie, but the very best film ever made",10,7 June 2000,"No film in the history of world cinema contains more than Kurosawa has packed into this amazing feat, and no film has said more about the human condition than this film.  And of course, no film is more technically and artistically well made as THE SEVEN SAMURAI.  This simply is the best that can possibly be.Certainly CITIZEN KANE, CASABLANCA and other films that have been hailed as the greatest are fine films (possibly even second and third to THE SEVEN SAMURAI), but this film stands as a monument to what the film medium can accomplish:  from a simple scene of a farmer picking up spilled rice from the floor, grain by grain, to a normally stoic samurai breaking into a smile after he has been praised by a younger colleague; from an old woman exacting her revenge on a bandit while other villagers look on to the pathos of a low-born man trying to become more than he was born to be.If you have never seen this film, do not pass from this world until you do. If the three-hour-plus running time worries you, the movie is very conveniently broken into two parts with an intermission, and it in no way hurts the flow of the movie to watch the segments on two separate days. Besides, consider how long you spent watching that dreck TITANIC.  SEVEN SAMURAI is only 12 minutes longer, yet the rewards of Kurosawa's epic are infinitely greater.Mere words cannot praise this cinematic achievement enough.  It is, bar none, the greatest film ever made.",Seven Samurai
379,kelshawd,The Seven Samurai,7,26 September 2006,"In 16th century Japan, civil war has broken out and farm land is under siege by bandits. The farmer cries out: ""Is there no god to protect us?"" The farmer is born to suffer. Fed up, they seek advice from the old sage of the village, ""grand dad,"" and he advises seeking help from samurai and gaining retaliation against the bandits.The samurai hired are men of a certain attainment of character, which is obvious, since the farmers have so little to offer as recompense. In spite of their faith in the samurai, the safety of the village women is suspect in the presence of these seven men. Traditionally, as warriors, they are rumored to enamor women, seduce them, and then leave.When the warriors come to town, they are introduced to the patriarch. One sneaks off to sound a false alarm of intrusion to expose the double sided agenda of the towns people. They want protection, but cannot entirely trust these men. Even as the samurai train the village men in the ways of warfare, there is an outburst from one farmer about the prevailing class differences between peasants and the seven who are of noble descent.Kikuchiyo, the one warrior of somewhat questionable motive (as evidenced by his flagrant disrespect toward others and disregard for the traditional somber wisdom a warrior must carry himself with, and lack of documentation attesting his pedigree nobility,) discovers the women the farmers have tried to hide. Eventually, all are preparing for war. Three bandits scouting the village are captured and the leader of samurai unsuccessfully tries to stop the villagers from torturing them, once again illustrating the sentiment for humanity that the samurai class was said to be lacking.Three samurai warriors and some farmers then case the bandits' camp, and Rikuchi (who has heretofore been tight lipped about his personal life) is discovered to have a spouse who is living with the villains. This foreshadows other emotional scars soon to be revealed. Kikuchiyo declares he is like the orphan baby he holds among the mill house ruins, a victim of the same criminal element when he was a child.He disguises himself as a bandit, infiltrates their forces and steals a weapon, just as another warrior did. But he is chastised for it, once again revealing the double standard between nobility and peasant class. Manjo, who's daughter, Shino has fallen in love with a warrior, insults them by disowning her once he discovers she has had relations with Katshuro, the youngest.Al last, the farmers and samurai win the battle. But in the end, ""The winners are the farmers, not us."" The samurai, who were historically denounced from noble class status, were exploited as a police force for the weak, bearing the prejudice from their own past abuses toward their society.Kurosawa's storyline is elemental. It is superficial and holding to only its essential dramatic elements without the depth and weight of symbolism he is known for in later films. Why? He makes room for developing the various and sundry political statements he only pointed at in Roshomon. The film is sociology (the caste of noblemen vs. peasants), feminism (a woman disguising herself as a male out of her father's false pride for her honor,) and cultural relativity (the good guys have some bad in them and the bad guys have some good,) all in one. The farmers are the victims and the samurai are the heroes at arm's length, until the heroes beat the villain. Then the farmers are the victors and the samurai are again set aside.It's pulp compared to Throne of Blood and Ran. I give it a 6.5",Seven Samurai

We look at it more as a historic artifact than as a movie. We admit the greatness of the film mostly because of the ""foundation"" it laid for future films and generations of directors. To be completely honest, this was what I thought before actually watching this film. But once the breathtaking 3h30-experience was over...I could only curse myself for this bias. This film, this experience is simply brilliant. You forget that this film is now more than 50years old, you forget in fact that this film has age...here we have a film that truly deserves the adjective ""timeless""! It is incredible how, after all the other samuraï-films made so far since then, not a single one can match this one (besides maybe other Kurosawa films). The acting is truly superb and of a rare authenticity, the camera-work is smooth and keeps you focused on the screen for every second. The story is great and many times copied but never equalized. In fact, it's like discovering the original sketch of a famous painting. Really, this is an absolute must-see, a masterpiece, a pure piece of Cinema with a big ""C"".... In fact I was thinking: if we were about to launch a capsule into space containing all what humanity has created so far (in case some aliens find it), it should contain this film!",Seven Samurai

383,The_Fear,Greatest Movie of All Time,10,24 February 2007,"Seven Samurai is widely considered one of, if not THE greatest film of all time. Recently, I purchased the 3-Disc Criterion DVD set and am very pleased with it, but I'll get into that briefly in a little while. The film is 207 minutes (as you can see above) and that may seem like a daunting ""task"" for some and I myself was worried that it would be overlong, packed with fluff and at times, boring. Man, was I ever wrong.In foreign films it is often hard, at least in my opinion, to gauge how well an actor performs because we do not speak the language. So much of the performance is in the delivery of the lines that the effect is sometimes greatly lowered. Not here though, the performances are so great that it doesn't matter whether or not you understand what they are saying. Everyone is very good here, but the main praise has to go to our seven samurai. Everything they do, every emotion they give is 100% believable. You really grow to care about them through the movie, which is very important in any movie. The farmers are good as well. Some not as good as others but there isn't anyone that was bad or bogged the film down in any way.The music is really great. Sometimes it seems like it doesn't go well with the scenes (it can be a little funky at times but you will realize that is goes perfect with the scene. Later in the movie, the ""funkiness"" dissipates and the music is subtle at times and loud at others but it always is perfect. Fumio Hayasaka should be very proud of what he did (well, if he were still alive that is. Sadly, he died just one year after this movie was released).Now, normally black and white movies, as I've found, don't have veryinteresting cinematography to say the least. It's normally point and shoot. Now, I'm sure that isn't the case with all black and white movies, but the ones I've seen are just plain. This however, is amazing. There is always something going on. Be it a stream flowing, horses moving, people walking, flags waving or water wheels moving, there is always something moving and it makes the movie that much more interesting. Everything is filmed in such a beautiful way and the black and white image just enhances it. I personally feel that it would be impossible for this movie to be as great as it is if it were to be in color.Now, the DVD is from Criterion and it is my first DVD from them. From what I hear, they make the best DVD's. They make them for film buffs. Everything about them is as perfect as they can be. That said, this is an amazing first Criterion DVD. The image is absolutely stunning, even though it was made in 1954 and wasn't preserved all too well. There is little grain to be found, even in the dark night scenes (the black levels are superb). The sound is as good as your going to get but the picture will floor you. The set comes with a great booklet and some features I haven't yet had a chance to check out. This is a superb DVD set and I cannot recommend it enough, even at $35, which some people might balk at (shame on you!).What else is there to say about Seven Samurai that hasn't been said yet over the 53 years since its release. Three and a half hours may seem like a long time to be watching a movie, but the movie couldn't have gone on long enough. I was completely engrossed in this world and this is a movie experience I will never have again, at least not a first time. As I stated earlier, many people consider this to be the greatest film put to celluloid. I happen to be in that camp. It blends every genre to complete perfection. There are breathtaking action scenes (the rain fight at the end is utterly amazing, but don't think that this is an all out action movie, action doesn't really start until a while into the film but it doesn't matter, it keeps you captivated throughout), hilarious comedy bits that still hold up after all these years (hence the ""hilarious"" bit), suspense, drama and even a hint of romance (not a ton though). While it is not my favorite film of all time (it's sure as hell way up there though), it is quite simply the greatest film I have ever set my eyes upon.",Seven Samurai
384,butler-britney,Shichinin no Samurai,9,4 May 2010,"Wow what an epic. It was a little difficult to get over the 207 minutes of the film and the slow pace of it. Once that barrier was broken the film was extremely entertaining. Akira Kurosawa was definitely a visionary that created an influential film. Kurosawa was often looked at for delivering the vision of classic Japanese culture, and it was done through his films. Shichinin no Samurai (Seven Samurai, Akira Kurosawa, Japan 1954, 207 min.) is a film that achieved success on so many levels. Seven Samurai is about a poor town that hires seven Samurai to protect them from Bandits. Each Samurai represents an archetype which allows for almost every audience member to identify with at least one character. My personal favorite was the sword master Kyûzô played by Seiji Miyaguchi. Throughout the entire movie Japanese culture is beautiful illustrated with stunning visuals and comedic dialogue. I am actually extremely impressed with the director of photography and editor of the film. The long shots, and the extended amount of editing that had to occur for that length of a movie is beyond extraordinary. There is no doubt in any mind that has seen this film, that Seven Samurai is very literally an EPIC film that will continue influencing cinema gloabally throughout time.",Seven Samurai

Even the subtitles, which I am sure lost much in the translation, didn't bother me at all.This movie lacks absolutely nothing.

The battle scenes that take place in the film are spectacular and they never loose their rhythm. What's even more striking about the film is that the feelings of the characters are often expressed in the background (this could be a type of weather) or expressed through the crowds' reaction to the characters or main character of the story. All aspects of this movie are excellent. It is a perfect study for filmmakers who want to learn the craft and composition of art, cinematography, staging of actors, and much more.The works of Akira Kurosawa continue to inspire many filmmakers that are making movies.

400,mcnimitz04,Long Film,6,11 May 2010,"The movie, ""Seven Samurai"" was released in the United States on November 19, 1956. It was directed by Akira Kurosawa. The movie was originally released in Japan two years earlier. The main downside of the film is that it is 207 minutes long. Since the film is so long, there is a lot of time that is spent on scenes that do not need to happen. For example the last hour of the movie is spent on the battle sequence where they just go back and forth. There were many other example of where the movie did not have to be as long as it was. However, the acting in the film was good. The samurai warriors in the film did a good job at portraying the thoughtful leader type. They always seem to know what to do. The story is about a group of samurais that are tasked to defend a small town against attacking bandits. It culminates into a big battle for the town at the end. The film seems to echo the horrors of World war two when the United States took over Japan. It could be argued that the bandits represent the Americans while the village represents Japan. Overall this movie was very well made. However the main drawback was that it was 207 minutes long. I feel that the length of the film draws away from the storyline. By dragging out the story like that, the film covers many scenes that do not need to happen. The storyline was almost too well developed. To the point where there was almost too much information that was given to the viewer that was not needed. However the actors portrayed their parts very well. There were some samurais that seemed to always know what to do and there were some that didn't.",Seven Samurai

Sorry for the ""olds"", it is timeless. The typical wit, courage and color of the Kurosawa characters is so outstanding that I think if he could make the movie now in color you would need about 30 seconds to recognize his hand. I also think the actors helped him a lot. It is a timeless and simple story, yet deeply touched by sensitive details. Do not watch this move if you want cheap effects, suspense and action.

For what purpose does one live? And for what purpose does one sacrifice one's life? What is it to choose a calling, and what does one give up? How does one man's fate differ from another's, and what choice has he in that?This is a film that I LOVE!

Seven Samurai is not very relevant to the modern world, especially in America.  Very little is done to develop characters and themes.  At best, this is a simple story which was stretched out to 3 1/2 hours.  I do agree that the directing and cinematography were groundbreaking and very ahead of their time.  I'm sure that the dialogue lost quite a bit of meaning and complexity in translation.  The subtitles are written at an 8-year old's reading level, and do not do well in expressing emotion or meaning.  There are other cultural barriers which will prevent the average viewer from fully grasping the plot.  The characters are, at best, underdeveloped.  It is quite possible to go through the whole movie without even knowing the main characters' names, let alone the intricacies of their personality.

I found it to be a very minimally entertaining film, I understood the characters and their motives but the pace is excruciating and the character just grow weary. It's not that its incredibly dated, its just that when watching something like The Last Samurai, the connection and the influence to Seven Samurai is easy to notice. But regardless of the technological advances in the 50 years between the two films, Last Samurai was just as engaging as this. I can't see some ocean of brilliance in the Seven Samurai, its kitsch is its appeal, the heroes grow tiresome. I know I can't accuse it of being cliché because it created its own spawn of wannabe samurai flicks...but its not a masterpiece of epic proportions. And its certainly not the sixth best film in history.",Seven Samurai
407,Nuada7,"Ground-breaking, absolutely incredible film!",10,1 October 2003,"Seven Samurai is easily one of the greatest epic movies you can find on shelves today, and that's before you consider the fact that it is (as of this commentary) half a century old.  One of this film's biggest claims to fame in western society is that the spaghetti western ""The Magnificent Seven"" was based completely around it, which is saddening as this is truly one of Akira Kurosawa's best works.  A classic among classics, one must keep several things in mind when watching this movie to fully grasp how good it is.First of all, don't forget that this movie was made in the 1950's.  Don't expect flashy special effects, explosions, blood and gore, or a huge symphonic opening number in THX.  They didn't have computers to help editing go perfectly, and fancier transitions (wipes, fades, dissolves, etc.) had to be done by hand, cutting the film up and putting it all back together. It's not up to today's standards, but it is by no means poorly or carelessly done.Next, remember that this was filmed in Japan less than a decade after the end of World War II, with the country having been decimated by the most destructive weapon ever actually used in war.  The Japanese economy wasn't exactly at its peak.  The film didn't have the multi-millions of dollars that are budgeted for action movies today, but it is still seamlessly beautiful.Lastly (off the top of my head)--and most important of all these--don't go comparing this movie to others you may have seen and think ""oh, they got that shot from such-and-such"".  No they didn't.  This is a true original, and various camera angles, filming styles, scenery setups, plot traits, character traits, and many, many other details of cinema are still mimicked after this film.  This is, at least in part, the very foundation for a huge portion of spaghetti westerns, late westerns, and action movies.A rare and beautiful 10/10.  WATCH THIS MOVIE.",Seven Samurai
408,swift127pk,Most Powerful Film Ever Made,10,11 October 2005,"last weekend i saw this classic movie and i was so touched and mesmerized after watching the movie.so full of life and rich in emotions hard to explain. anyhow the story starts as the villagers are distressed by the looting by the savage bandits who take away their food and left them with grief and woe.they were totally broken and wrecked by the mean bandits.finally they mutually decided to hire a bandit to save them from this torture.some of them went to city and begin to find a samurai which could agree coming with them.finally they convinced one samurai which suggested that six more are needed for this task so he then begin to look for the other six and eventually succeeded.it was so interesting that the villagers only offered food as what they grow which was accepted by these a samurai.it was so painful to see the distress in the eyes of the villagers.i opt to say that they acted so brilliantly that they were not seemed as performing,they look as they were real.every thing made this movie a masterpiece editing,screenplay,cinematography and specially direction.Akira was a god gifted person, no doubt he is one of the greatest directors in the world .the movie is although a long but u will never get bored and your curiosity and interest develop by passing every minute.I'm thinking of watching it again. i would say a highly acclaimed movie would not be missed.",Seven Samurai
409,bryan-mconnor,an absolute masterpiece,10,14 December 2013,"So many words come to mind in describing Akira Kurosawa's epic action drama Seven Samurai. This is filmmaking at its very best. This is an expertly crafted film that is grand in scope and delivers the ultimate viewing experience for the cinema buff. The plot is simple, yet the execution is immaculate, with great directing, wonderful pacing and great action scenes. The film combines elements of a drama and action film very well and there's enough going for this film to make it stand out as a definitive classic of cinema. Akira Kurosawa is a master of cinema, one of the greats and he has proved that with this outstanding work. This film is not for everyone as it is nearly four hours long and it focuses more on telling a compelling story than focusing on action. With that said, Seven Samurai is a beautiful picture that some great performances and is among the best foreign films ever made. What is surprising about this film is that director Kurosawa is able to pull off such a grand film using such a simple idea. The result is outstanding. Filmed in beautiful black and white, Seven Samurai is an epic picture that would influence films for many years to come. With this picture, Akira Kurosawa created new ideas that would be seen in many future releases. The reason that this film is so good is because the film relies more on performances and storytelling to entertain the viewer and it does that in spades. If you're not into epics or hate slow-paced movies, then this is not a film for you. However if you want to watch one of the defining works in cinema history, regardless, Seven Samurai is definitely essential viewing. This for me is one of the first grand epics of the 1950's and other would soon follow such as The Ten Commandments and Ben-hur. Seven Samurai is long, granted, but you can't deny its impact on cinema, and with that said, it's a masterful picture that is breathtaking from start to finish.",Seven Samurai
410,aerovertice,An artistic action flick,10,3 May 2010,"Seven Samurai is an artistic action flick, if that makes any sense. It is made by one of the most revered and legendary film-makers of all time: Akira Kurosawa. Kurosawa is one of those rare film makers who can strike a wonderful balance between art and entertainment, and no movie of his displays that fact better than Seven Samurai.Seven Samurai is the story of a group of seven Samurai (maybe not exactly seven) who are hired by farmers to defend their village from the marauding bandits. It is set in 16th Century Japan, period in history when feudalism was breaking apart, and many of the formerly employed Samurai were out on the streets, roaming around as free ronins. Many Samurai adopted the role of bandits and took to pillaging villages. It is against this backdrop that Seven Samurai is set, and as a result, it is able to touch upon a lot of the issues of social conflict between the farmers and the Samurai; as it ironically turns out, the Samurai are both the perpetrators and the protectors of the villagers.Although set against a serious social backdrop, the movie is, nevertheless, filled with humor and thrilling excitement. The plot is extremely involving; as an audience member, you feel as though you are right there with the others, as though you are the eighth samurai, taking part in all the mapping and the planning. The characters are all very diverse and complement each other perfectly. The star of the show, however, is Kikuchiyo, played by Toshiro Mifune, who lights up the screen with his clownish antics; although a seeming lunatic, he turns out to be the string that binds all the elements together, not just within the groupof Samurai, but also within the entire village.Running at a whopping 3 ½ hours, the length may discourage some from viewing Seven Samurai, but trust me, as you watch this movie, time will fly by.",Seven Samurai
411,jw52,heroic dimensions,10,28 October 2006,"I suppose I shouldn't respond directly to another reviewer; but I'm a little irked at the lack of historical knowledge parading itself as cleverness.""What military strategist tells his/her army to drink sake and have sex the night before the final battle?"" This is a soldier having to lead nonprofessionals in combat - townsmen who have become aware that tomorrow's battle may be their last. To deny this of them would be to make a mockery of their whole existence; and the samurai is their to affirm their existence.""How omnipotent the samurai were to foresee all the enemy's activities so completely....all except the last soldier making it into the barn with all the women folk?"" I remember absolutely no attempted demonstration of ""omnipotence"" in this film. The samurai leader is making reasonable strategic and tactical presumptions; that's what strategy and tactics are all about. What military strategist would not know this? And what human being is so perfect as to avoid mistakes? ""They could construct spears and elaborate fences, but not more bow and arrows?"" Bow fighting in rapid combat is an art; it takes time and patience to learn. When we watch the one samurai who uses the bow and arrow in the final battle, notice how much care he has to take - and yet he's supposed to magically transform the villagers into expert archers in a few days?! - Please.""Did they not know to kill or maim the horses underneath the bandits rather than reaching way up to hit the soldiers themselves?"" If you had paid attention to the movie, you would have noticed that everybody but the bandits walk. Horses were not plentiful at this time in Japanese history, they were worth their weight in gold; killing them would be a folly.Riding rapidly is also an art; the scene where the captured horses are used demonstrates this clearly. Thus capturing all the horses (besides requiring a bloody battle in and of itself) would have been futile, since only a handful would know how to ride, and only the samurai would know how to ride in combat.""Did the bandits not know how to cut their losses and look for the next easy-pickings village for plundering?"" Maybe - if they weren't literally starving - a point made twice in the film. The samurai agree to defend the village for a few bowls of rice - this tells us that Japan is in a sorry state economically in the era of this setting.Alainsane wants this film to be a bogus action fantasy, where all human elements have been reduced, where all that matters is hack-'n'-slash and pretty girls and the latest hunk flexing muscles.Instead, what Kurosawa has given us is a magnificent historical commentary on desperate people in desperate times - even the bandits earn a little sympathy, if only for their tenaciousness and bravado in the face of death.This is a film about people - not about cartoons. It's about real history, not about some pubescent fantasy of power. It's about choice, and the ability to remain true to one's self - to learn who one really is, and to live that person to the fullest, even with death near at hand.This about life well-lived, regardless of the trouble and sorrow that brings.A work of heroic dimensions; viewers open to it will feel the richer for it.",Seven Samurai

I thought that it would be very slow and boring, but I was wrong. 3 well spent hours. The movie has a good story and great characters. It also has good jokes. You could actually call this a comedy. Kikuchiyo is probably the best character. His really funny, he raises the villages and our morale, but he is also a brave warrior. The movie also has drama and adventure and these parts are also great. I already talked about Kikuchiyo, but the other six samurais are also great characters. We have a very serious guy who only wants to perfect his fighting skills, we have an older and very smart samurai, a youngster, who is still more a kid then a warrior, etc.A movie well worth watching! 10PS. This is for the younger generation. I am 18 years old, still I sat down to watch a 3 hours long black and white movie. It doesn't have to be in color to be good.

Like it's American counterpart with it's all star cast, it makes the watcher wonder ""would I be able to do that?""Unlike it's American counterpart, there's a slowness to the film which I can only say is truly 'Japanese'. Similar to spaghetti westerns, the focus is on the facial expressions and the eye contact. This would in some cases bore or amuse, but if you've really sat down to enjoy this film, and you allow yourself to 'get into it', it puts across not only the acting styles (perhaps on the amateurish side from time to time), but also emphasises the depth of the feelings of the characters involved.The Seven Samuri is a film of honour, born out of tradition, in a land where both are highly valued.Watch it, simply to prove me wrong :)10/10",Seven Samurai

Fact of the matter is, modern movies ARE better than movies of bygone eras...the acting is better, the storylines are crisper, they're better directed, there's more attention to detail, etc. This is just one guy's opinion, but after watching this movie, ask yourself a question...If this movie were to come out today (with the same acting and directing), would it receive the same high acclaim it enjoys?

417,ikiru71-220-566499,A true masterpiece,10,29 August 2013,"Akira Kurosawa directed 31 films during his career. That is a impressive number for any director, but it is even more impressive when you consider how many of theses are truly great films. Because of this choosing the greatest Kurosawa film is no easy task. I've always been partial to ""Ikiru"" as my favorite Kurosawa film, but ""Seven Samurai"" is a close second. For those not aware the basic premise of the film is a group of seven samurai are recruited to help defend a poor farming village from invading bandits. That may sound like a simple plot, but this film is far from that. The film is a complex and rich story told in three acts. The first is the recruiting of the samurai, the second is the preparation for battle, and the third is the battle. At over 3 hours long one would think this would be a boring film, but it isn't. The film is excellently paced and never drags. This is due to the great story, well-developed characters, wonderful performances, great action scenes, and, of course, Kurosawa's fantastic direction.One example of Kurosawa's great direction in this movie is his use of ""deep focus"". These are shots where he chooses to compose it in order to get many subjects in the frame and in focus at the same time. By doing this he gives us a better sense of what is going on. In some of the shots we can see how every character is reacting to a situation at the same time, without cutting back and forth between them. In other shots he gives us a sense of characters and how they relate to their surroundings.He uses this extensively in the second act to help establish the layout of the town. So, by the third act, we have a thorough understanding of how and where the action is taking place. Even during the action Kurosawa uses these wider shots to show us what is happening and put things in perspective. He uses camera movement and composition to emphasize the action, instead of rapidly cutting between shots. Some modern directors would do well to take note of this technique.Watching ""Seven Samurai"" one might feel that many of the scenes are familiar. That's partly because the film was remade into ""The Magnificent Seven"" in 1960 but it also because this film has inspired countless similar action films since its first release. The recruiting scenes, the training scenes, and the fight scenes have been duplicated in many ways. There is even a scene toward the beginning of the film in which one of the lead characters shows his intelligence and talent by defeating a villain completely unrelated to the main plot. It's a nice character establishing scene that is ubiquitous in modern day action films. Kurosawa has been listed as an primary influence by great directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese. Watching ""Seven Samurai"" it is easy to see why he is such an influence. It is a true classic and one of the great masterpieces of the cinema.",Seven Samurai

I can't find any bad thing about this masterpiece although I saw it something over 100 times. Every scene is necessary and perfectly directed; every part has different atmosphere. There are liricism, humour, suspense and definitely most powerful and dynamic battle scenes ever filmed (Peter Jackson should watch it to learn). Kurosawa shot them using long objectives and four cameras simultaneously; this technique was precursory at 1954 and makes very well today.

Whether viewed as a culturally specific motif of the transition that the samurai was forced to make in the modern era or as a timeless story of honor, integrity and justice, this is a masterful piece of film-making.

422,travised87,One of those films to watch before you die!,10,10 February 2007,"When you have undergone a journey, you feel, that a change has occurred, that there is some growth, some learning and development within you that was absent at the start. Many films you watch, start at point A, and after the end, bring you back to point A. This film however, carries you along with it, so you feel part of the events that have unfolded before your eyes. At the beginning, you are thrust into the suffering of the village folk, their pain and desperation. As the film progresses, you get to know them, that they are more multi-faceted than first perceived. At the end, however, it is the samurai than you connect with, and like them, the euphoric singing of the farmers seems alien and distant to you. So you start the journey with the farmers, and finish it off with the samurai. Yes there is a melancholic feel that is not freed from the film; what's more is that it is what we can connect to better than any joy displayed in bouts. Such is the mood of the film that the ambivalence of life is inextricably linked to it.There is little else anyone can say about this film, beyond what has been said already. The pace of the film, which I was slightly wary of before watching it, was perfect I thought. The depth and detail of the plot required a painstaking build-up, if only for verisimilitude's sake. The interactions between the farmers and the samurai, two different strata of society, reveal the blatant similarities they share, concealed beneath the veil of social standing. Toshiro Mifune's character is the bridge between the two, and tellingly sacrifices his life, for the love of his ancestry, and to prove himself a true samurai. His acting is wonderful, along with Takashi Shimura's and the rest of the principal cast. Shimura who looked pathetic, decrepit in Ikiru, is a strong, canny leader here, particularly to Katsushiro. The film itself of course, can also be seen as the coming-of-age story of Kutsushiro, from a novice samurai 'child' to a war hero and lover. There is little the samurai could take away from the battle, but his growth could be one.For us though, there is a milestone in film-making to take away, something that will remain with us for a very long time.

425,Severian-6,Find hungry samurai,10,24 June 2008,"One of the greatest films ever made, and my all-time number one ever since I first saw it on BBC 2 when I was a sprog. An essentially simple tale of peasant farmers hiring a band of ronin to protect their village from an impending bandit raid, this movie has everything going for it - action, comedy, romance, tragedy, musings on the lot of humanity, beautiful cinematography, a sparkling script, stunning location work, and mesmerising performances from the ""Kurosawa-gumi"", Akira Kurosawa's core selection of actors with whom he worked again and again.Aside from the legendary Toshiro Mifune's highly-entertaining and eccentric turn as Kikuchiyo, the peasant-turned-ronin (reminiscent of his earlier performance as the bandit in ""Rashomon""), there is Takashi Shimura as Kambei, the world-weary and self-effacing leader of the samurai, and Daisuke Kato as Shichiroji, his efficient second-in-command. Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara (who Kurosawa would later cast as the comic peasants Tahei and Mataschichi in ""The Hidden Fortress"", the twin inspirations for C3PO and R2D2 of ""Star Wars"" fame) are present as, respectively, the cheerful ronin Heihachi and the weaselly, somewhat creepy villager Manzo. Also look out for Seiji Miyaguchi as the super-cool sword master Kyuzo. Then there's the wonderfully monkey-faced Bokuzen Hidari as the eternally timid and put-upon peasant Yohei. Finally, see if you can spot the famous Japanese actor Tatsuya Nakadai in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him walk-on role as a passing samurai. The first time he'd worked for Kurosawa, but not the last by a long chalk.It's nice to know that I'm not the only one who adores this movie - that's why John Sturges remade it in 1960 as The Magnificent Seven.",Seven Samurai

429,fakeatbeingasnob,Amazing movie,9,3 February 2021,"What can I say? It's one viewed as one of the best films of all time for a reason. Honestly the movies biggest weakness is the reputation it has gathered. Very few films are as revered as this one so people go in with expectations so astronomically high they walk out disappointed. Just read some of the lower reviews. However I am happy to say that seven samurai was able to live up to the hype for me. It is beautifully shot and acted. I cared about every single one of the characters. Each samurai is distinct and memorable and you sympathize with the villagers. It is a movie I believe I will enjoy more and more with each subsequent viewing. The movie is long at 3 1/2 hours but I was able to watch it in one sitting no problem. The movie is also surprisingly heartwarming and had many great comedic moments. The chemistry between the actors was great and the way Kurusowa handles the films themes is respectable.Now then, why didn't I give this a perfect 10 out of 10. Well a few factors went into play. The first being that there were some moments of overacting. This takes place mostly in the beginning. For the most part, the acting was spectacular and even the scenes that were a little over the top did not take me out of the film. However that does not change the fact that those scenes existSecond, the stabbing does look rather fake. You cannot really blame the movie for this considering when it was made. The choreography was spectacular. Better than a lot of movies today. But when people were stabbed it did not look very real.And that is it. Those are my only problems with the movie and I should add that they really did not bother me at all. I found it very easy to forgive them considering the time the movie was made, how much the movie did right, and because I was so hooked start to finish by the story that I quickly forgot about them. Alot of people complain that they felt the run time of the movie. While this wasn't an issue for me I could totally see how others can be put of by the long run time. Even people that loved the movies just struggle sitting down for long periods of time and there is nothing wrong with that. I watched this movie on HBO MAX and they kept the intermission which takes place an hour and a half into the movie. So if you are a person that struggles with long run times just know that there is an intermission. That should help you focus your attention on the movie instead of clicking of to see how much time is left. You can take a break or just come back and finish it the next day. Do not listen to snobby a-holes who say there is only one way to enjoy the film.The most important thing is for you to walk in with reasonable expectations. I am not saying for you to be easier on the film because it was released in the 50's. This is the case for all films. How many recent films have you seen that you were disappointed because it didn't live up to the hype?

But you can't compare this movie to those from the 21 st century, because it's all different, the picture is not as good as today and the effects... but except from this you can compare this movie to what you want... but it still will not be the same. You can compare Casino Royale to Shooter ( for example) because they are almost the same kind of movies, but don't try to compare them to this movie, the movies now are so much different then they where before, if you understand what I mean. Akira Korusawa does a great job with this movie, it contains all the good stuff... So see this movie but don't judge it before you have seen it( As I expect many of you will do!!",Seven Samurai
432,russian-movie-fan,Long & Boring Good movie,8,22 May 2008,"So whats all the hype about this movie? I've watched literally thousands of movies in my life and decided to see this one. Well, in 2008 its dated and very quaint. There are two impressive things about the movie that today's audiences will appreciate. 1) The use of camera close-ups on faces to accentuate plot points and tense scenes. 2) The use of camera to film action sequences in the last 30 minutes of the movie. Those are the best things in the movie and were revolutionary in its time. So for historical purposes, one can argue that this was important. However, these two novel techniques don't overshadow the fact that the movie is slow in its pacing, runs much too long with quite a few irrelevant scenes (the girl-boy in the woods scenes are out of place). In fact, another problem with this movie, is that for western audiences much of the context surrounding the life of the samurai and Japanese life are simply absent. Without any historical knowledge one is left w/many questions about the actions of the characters in the movie and the motives behind them. In short, it is a good movie that you should watch once for its historical significance, but there is not much that you can take away from it (as a modern viewer). There are too many action movies that have come along that are much better filmed and more captivating than this movie. Like a one-shot wonder resting on his laurels, this movie keeps getting more famous as the years go by for some novel features that it introduced. Although captivating for its time, by today's standards this piece of cinema is simply good but not great.",Seven Samurai

The start of the movie is very good with nice ( creepy ) music in the background and barbarians who are approaching to the village and i also liked when people from the village go to the city to find the samurai's and then they test them!At the end this movie could be better in my book as far as acting but the great thing about this movie is crossway !",Seven Samurai

Granted, the setting is an usual one and the acting is different, in a good way, but you get past that, and start realizing that this is one excellent movie. The lighting, the camera angles, the writing ... all top notch. The story is taught, even throwing in some humor for even measure. The subject matter is downright brutal in many aspects ... taking a sword to get rid of your foe is up close and personal. There is no hiding from behind a building or a tree and firing a weapon.

437,django822,Easily One of the Finest Films of the 20th Century,10,15 January 2014,"Clocking in at just under four hours with not a scrap of filler, Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI is every bit as legendary at its enthusiasts would have you believe. The basic story is extremely simple. In a period of social chaos, a small farming village learns it will once more be attacked by a band of thirty bandits after the harvest. At first the farmers despair, but village elder Gisaku (Kokuten Kodo) recalls that in his childhood a similar village met a similar situation by hiring Samurai to defend them. The villagers accordingly send representatives to the city, where they are able to convince Samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) to undertake the defense.If the plot sounds familiar, it should: Hollywood would translate it into the extremely popular 1960 western THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN--but fine though that film is, it pales beside THE SEVEN SAMURAI, which effectively turns an action film premise into a character study of the first order and endows the story with both tremendous simplicity and artistry. Much of this is due an extraordinary ensemble cast, which includes the celebrated Toshiro Mifune (who would later appear in Kurosawa's THRONE OF BLOOD and YOJIMBO); above this, however, is Kurosawa's remarkable vision that draws upon the visual motif of the circle.The circle is a powerful presence in SAMURAI. The village is presented as a roughly circular pattern of houses; the farmers meet in circles; in due time the Samurai enter the circle and stand at the center of the circle, directing the defense--and indeed the circle will become the defense, as Shimada works to find means to draw the bandits into the circle and to their doom.Shot in simple black and white, as much (if not more) a detailed character and culture study as it is an action film, THE SEVEN SAMURAI is extremely simple and yet extremely subtle, and ultimately one of the most powerful films it has been my pleasure to review. The quality of the Criterion DVD transfer is very good, but by no means flawless--although it survives well, the film has not been digitally restored, and artifacts are frequent. There is little in the way of bonus material, but the commentary by Michael Jeck is quite fine. Strongly recommended.",Seven Samurai

It is also a work of art that is exceptionally entertaining. Not even it's numerous imitators could live up to this.What makes this film work are 3 things:1)Akira Kurosawa's direction. Every shot and frame of this film is so perfect that it completely immersises you into the film.2)The character depth. Kurosawa allows his characters, both the villagers and the samurai, to be flawed people and not just complete stereotypes; and finally 3)The pace. Kurosawa takes his time to tell to story so you can get an understanding of what's going on. In the synopsis of this film tells about these Japanese villagers who hire seven samurai warriors to protect them from bandits who keep ambushing them. However, the film is much deeper than that.

The characters, each with their own small set of traits and ingredients, make a perfectly flavored team. Each of the samurai had 2 or 3 overwhelming traits which I found made the characters simple, yet intriguing. Like the young samurai that was still very childish and naive yet he volunteers himself for everything. The wannabe samurai that is always trying to prove himself annoyed the heck out of me for awhile but then he grew on me. Kurosawa is long, really long; he definitely has a sense of story telling that reminds me of a story a bard would tell, (probably in the same length of time).

If this same movie was made NOW with the a story but in a slightly different setting it would be massive. Change the samurai for an all star cast and give them guns and it would be a sure fire hit with the 'gung ho yeehaaa! brigade that have given this film one star. 3 or 4 I could get as its subtitled and some parts of the dialogue will be missing but one?

I can't agree with other reviewers that it's an action movie, it's more of an adventure with action sequences.The strong points of the movie include great cinematography, good casting, nice locations. Everything looks authentic and real. The main story is interesting as well, although this brings me to the execution of the main idea, the biggest weakness of the movie: the script.In the script, logic is often sacrificed for style:not all samurai have convincing motivations for joining the quest (Gorobei and especially Kyuzo)the bandits should have withdrawn after incurring heavy casualties, but that of course doesn't make a great dramatic ending...none of the bandits kill anyone with a sword which is strange, but could be an underlying message ?too quick reload times for a medieval gunEditing issues:Gorobei's death isn't shownthe pacing is sometimes slow, many scenes could have been shortened, some cut (eg. farmer scenes in the town at the beginning, Shino-Katsushiro scenes)Technical issues:it is painfully obvious that no one is really ever stabbed or cutmost peasants wore headpieces instead of actually shavingMiscellaneous issues include occasional overacting, eastern-style juvenile attempts at humor (like in most kung fu films).All in all an enjoyable adventure that tries just a bit too hard to be an epic of some sorts.7/10",Seven Samurai

450,salfamily,Required Viewing,10,29 July 2001,"The archetypal action film, Seven Samurai is also one of the richest works to ever be committed to celluloid. Each of its characters is extraordinarily realized; each has his or her own arc, his or her own vital part to play in the film's slow progression towards its dramatic finale. Typically, Kurosawa has put the film together using an exceeding degree of artistry; each and every shot, each action sequence, is exquisitely composed; and yet none seems contrived or out-of-place within the overall fabric of the work. Everything is beautifully conceived and in focus, both literally and figuratively.When watching Seven Samurai, movie lovers will immediately recognize that several of its key elements can be readily detected in countless similar films made during the last half-century. The audition scenes, in which several samurai are recruited for the difficult task of defending a farming town from a group of bandits, strikes a particularly familiar chord, as do those showing the samurai training the lowly villagers to fight and use weapons. Indeed, the theme of a highly experienced group of ""tough guys"" taking up the cause of the disenfranchised has become something of an action film cliche, portions of which echo throughout the American western, as well as its progeny (think The Dirty Dozen, The Road Warrior or even television's The A Team).But what really stands out in Seven Samurai are its characters. They run the gamut, from elder teacher to hopeful youth, stoic warrior to undisciplined brigand. Kurosawa even finds room for a youthful romance, not to mention the mix of poor and beleaguered townspeople he depicts within the setting of the town. Perhaps its no wonder the enemy bandits are virtually faceless-- there is so much conflict and passion present within the group of protagonists, the villains need not be more than a vague threat. Through it all Kurosawa never forgets who these people are and where they stand in comparison to one another. Obviously, the samurai are, for the most part, samurai, while the townspeople are merely peasants, lacking even in funds to pay their noble defenders. Kurosawa deftly illustrates these class differences by having one peasant fear horribly for the honor of his daughter, who he suspects will be lured by the wealth of the samurai; and also by giving us one samurai who is no samurai at all, but merely a peasant himself whose own farming village was in his youth destroyed by marauding warriors. The film thus wraps a a portrait of class conflict in a cloak of solidarity. The samurai unite to defend the poor peasants, but the ending is not exactly happy for them. Nor are the peasants completely honorable. We learn, for instance, that they have in the past murdered defeated samurai and looted their bodies, and it becomes apparent late in the film that their claims of poverty are perhaps not as truthful as at first seemed apparent.So why do the samurai defend them so valiantly? For honor? For love of adventure? The answer to this question is left intentionally vague; it is up to each viewer to draw his or her own conclusions. It is to the film's credit that it forces such questions upon us while never allowing them to cause the motivations of its characters to seem untrue.Modern viewers will find the action sequences of Seven Samurai to be restrained. There are, for instance, no ""Gladiator"" or ""Braveheart"" moments in which limbs are visibly hacked off, blood flies and speakers pound with booming audio. But the action is wonderfully filmed and there is some early use of slow motion to accentuate key moments. The 3 1/2 hour running time may also deter some, but I find the length to be one of the film's charms; it takes its dear sweet time in exposing its riches, and no single moment feels underdeveloped or awkward. Don't miss it.10/10",Seven Samurai

The characters have been well chosen to manifest traits such as wisdom, panic, foolishness, desperation, humor, love, longing and rebellion during times of war.

459,Musashi94,Kurosawa's Magnum Opus,10,18 May 2019,"What can be said about Seven Samurai that hasn't already been said at this point? Ever since its release in April of 1954, it has been considered one of the greatest films of all time. And deservedly so in my opinion. I must admit that I am biased: Seven Samurai is my favorite movie of all time and I consider Akira Kurosawa to be the greatest director of all time. That being said, I have tried to keep my review from being too effusive even though I would give this film the strongest possible recommendation. While I do not believe a ""perfect"" film exists - nor do I believe will one ever exist - I believe Seven Samurai is as close to perfect as a film can get.The film is set in the 16th century and Japan has been devastated by decades of political instability and almost constant military conflict. As a result, bandits roam the countryside unchecked, wreaking havoc on whatever small farming villages they encounter. Aware of a forthcoming bandit raid, one village decides to hire the titular seven samurai to lead the defense of the village and train its inhabitants in the ways of war. Sure enough, the bandits arrive, setting the stage for a decisive battle that will decide the fate of the village.While fairly straightforward as far as plot summaries go, the film's narrative is extremely engrossing and rich in subtext. Seven Samurai is one of the few films with an epic duration (almost three-and-a-half hours) that uses its runtime to its advantage. Not only does the film explore each of the seven samurai in depth, it also takes the time to highlight some of the villagers, giving its cast of characters the kind of depth rarely seen in standalone films. Because of the time spent getting to know these characters, the audience naturally grows to empathize with them and become more invested in their story.The class differences and accompanying social inequality between the samurai and the villagers, who are all poor farmers, is also a major focus throughout the film. When the samurai first arrive in the village, the inhabitants hide in their homes and refuse to meet their new protectors, afraid that they have exchanged one oppressor for another. Even after the villagers become more comfortable with the samurais' presence, there is palpable sense of uneasiness to their interactions. It is later revealed that the villagers hunt down and kill samurai from defeated armies in order to take their equipment. The samurai are infuriated until one of their number - a peasant masquerading as a samurai - points out their hypocrisy. The villagers may be treacherous and cowardly, but they are the way they are due to centuries of oppression by the samurai, the ruling elite in 16th century Japan. In fact, many of the bandits terrorizing the village are themselves samurai whose clans have been destroyed. Even at the end of the film, with the bandits defeated and the villagers joyously planting their fall rice crop, the social divide still remains. The samurai have defended the village, but only three of them have survived and they grimly realize that the victory does not belong to them for their code prevents them from adopting a farmer's lifestyle; they are doomed to wander the countryside until they find a new master to serve or a new cause to take up.Written by Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, the story manages to be epic while retaining a focus on detail. This keeps Seven Samurai from feeling bloated or overlong; each section of the film feels necessary in telling the overarching story and each scene feels like it illuminates either a character or a major theme such as class, duty, or identity. This also grounds the narrative and avoids the common pitfall of epic movies by overwhelming the audience with the vastness of the story it's trying to tell; inundating them with too many characters and events to keep track of.Kurosawa's direction is bold and dynamic, displaying his trademark mastery of movement and blocking. Even static shots are interesting to look at due to his excellent use of mise-en-scène or mood lighting. Of course, when discussing his direction, I would be remiss not to point out the battle scenes which are staged in a way that conveys the chaos and confusion of armed conflict while being shot in a way that the audience can still follow what is happening.Acting wise, we get the usual trope of Kurosawa collaborators. The legendary Toshiro Mifune plays Kikuchiyo, a fiery and turbulent samurai pretender whose character serves as the emotional heart of the film. In a sense, he is the link that keeps the samurai and the villagers together due to his innate understanding of the later and his desperation to be considered one of the former. Ironically, for one of his most iconic roles, Mifune is actually playing against type somewhat. Typically, the characters he played were laconic and stoic, ruled by a strong sense of justice. Kikuchiyo is loud, obnoxious and impulsive. This freedom of expression gives Mifune's performance a sense of energy some of his more typecast roles would lack, and I find it to be the strongest performance of his career. Takashi Shimura plays the leader of the samurai, Shimada Kambei, and gives the character a sense of gravitas while also displaying great humility and empathy. Mifune as Kikuchiyo might be the emotional heart of the film, but it just wouldn't work without Shimura's stalwart persona.Amongst the supporting cast, the highlights are Seiji Miyaguchi as the formidable Kyuzo, the most skilled of the seven, and Yoshio Tsuchiya as the impassioned Rikichi, the farmer in charge of recruiting and hosting the samurai. Miyaguchi - relegated to minor roles for most of his career - gives an understated delivery that helps Kyuzo feel authentically badass. Tsuchiya plays his part with a boldness that belies desperation, owing to the fact that his character's wife has been abducted by the bandits.The score is provided by Fumio Hayasaka. While I generally prefer the work of composers who worked with Kurosawa later in his career such as Masaru Sato and Toru Takemitsu, Hayasaka's score is a personal favorite of mine. It perfectly encapsulates the melancholy yet stubbornly hopeful mood of the picture, particularly with its haunting main theme. Asakazu Nakai also does an excellent job with the film's cinematography, particularly with regard to depth of field and shadows. As was always the case, Kurosawa edited his own film and manages to synergize his expert direction of motion with his editing, creating a kind of rhythm that keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. Kurosawa has sometimes been called the greatest editor who ever lived and Seven Samurai is a testament to that accolade: it's a three-and-a-half-hour film that has never felt like a three-and-a-half-hour film when I've watched it. Rounding out the miscellaneous aspects of the film, the production design is fantastic. The sets and costumes look authentically lived in (in fact Kurosawa had several cast members wears their costumes prior to filming to achieve this effect) which greatly aids in the believability of the setting. This feels like pre-modern Japan and not just a facsimile of it.In conclusion, Seven Samurai deserves its reputation as the one of the greatest films of all time. I cannot recommend Kurosawa's magnum opus enough to anyone interested in film whatsoever. Regardless, of whether your interest in film is based on its artistic aspects or on its ability to entertain, the film delivers on almost every level. In the film, the victory may belong to the farmers; in reality, the victory belongs to all of us for having the privilege of being able to watch it.",Seven Samurai
460,ffbadd,The Best of Akira Kurosawa,10,28 May 2005,Well first off I just have to say that Akira Kurosawa is one of the most brilliant directors ever. His work is incredible each and every movie never the same and yet having a lot of the same actors. Not a lot of people could handle doing that. Seven Samurai though would have to be Akira Kurosawa's greatest work. The pace of the movie is put together greatly making you want to see what will happen next.Akira alongside his faithful actor Toshiro Mifune make this movie a great buy or watch and is worthy of being on any list of the greatest movie out there. The movie may seem long but the ending is worth the wait and the humor that holds the movie together is just as good. I would give this movie a ten out of ten.10/10,Seven Samurai
461,world_forest_bug888,Marvellous!,10,9 February 2006,"Its sad really, sad the way teens with their pop crap go off watching something like 2 Fast 2 Furious and stick their two thumbs up because its ""in"" and then they see this movie and just because it has no color and no English it ""bad"". I actually think that it being black and white and devoid from the English language makes it just that bit better.But enough about stupid teenagers heres my review.This was the first Akira Kurosawa film I had seen and the fact that it went for 3 and a half hours kind of put me off. But nevertheless I was convinced to see it and when I did I tried my hardest not to blink because I would miss one nanosecond of a great film. The music was superb, story was even more superb and has been remade many times (Magnificent Seven, A Bugs Life etc.) and the action sequences didn't rely on flashy cgi crap to make me totally into it. Toshiro Mifune is positively wonderful and god I could go on.But alas no great film is great without cons. Please wait a few hours while I see if there are any. The fight sequence with the bamboo sticks in the town took too long both with the swords and bamboo. The sub story with Katsuhiro and Manzos daughter was unnecessary. But other than that the film was perfect! So if you're into crap like House of Wax because it has Paris Hilton in it destroy the DVD or video of it and watch Shichinin no Samurai over and over until you get that stupid I'll watch bad movies because its ""in"" idiocy out of your head and watch something cultured.(Apologies to those who are pro teen and like 2 Fast 2 Furious or House of Wax)",Seven Samurai
462,bunot,among top 5 greatest movies ever!!!,10,10 June 1999,"A remarkable cinematic masterpiece. A story that is timeless and classic. Characters that grasp your attention. Akira Kurosawa is truly the greatest director in the history of film-making. His style and manner has influenced directors like Scorcese, George Lucas and Spielberg. The right blend of humor and compassion that the film expresses is something other films try to strive for, but fall short when compared to this movie.(Notice too, if you've seen the Phantom Menace....George Lucas uses the ""sliding cut"" scene, something that Kurosawa started and can be seen in the 7 Samurai.)Some scenes that exemplify Kurosawa's creativity in this movie:scene where Manzo finds out Shino slept with Katsushiro and it starts to rain. Kurosawa focuses on the campfire and you see the fire slowly fizzle and start to die as the rain start to pour down heavily.scene where Kyuzo kills the stubborn samurai in a duel. after Kyuzo cuts him, Kurosawa films in slow motion and you can see the other samurai fall slowly to the ground and the dust around him billow slowly.I don't understand why people are complaining about the length...I for one, didn't want the movie to end.",Seven Samurai
463,SonOfaGunderson,Awesome,10,3 February 2001,"In 1954, Kurosawa made foreign film history with Seven Samurai. Everything about this film is just absolutely terrific. The film lasts around 3 1/2 hours, and every minute of it is unbelievable filmmaking. Kurosawa's blend of stellar craft, captivating cinematography, ravishing art direction, and unforgettable characters makes this one of the most intelligent films ever made. The first hour is devoted to devoloping the many four-dimensional characters which inhabit the film throughout. When watching the film, the audiece cares for, trusts, mourns and ultimately believes every single attribute the characters have. Samurai set up the way that many action films are made today; films like Predator and Alien still work within it's boundaries. The battle scenes are terrific and the fast-paced editing is ground-breaking. If people have a problem with subtitles and long movies, then see this and your opinions will change. The sheer filmmaking of Kurosawa will not disappoint. Also see Yojimbo and High & Low.",Seven Samurai
464,tracy.carver,the movie that started all other good movies,10,10 July 2001,"I loved it.  This movie is sophisticated and thoughtful filmmaking that is so much more than the simple title.  Wanna know where Coppola, Spielberg, and Lucas got some ideas?  Watch this movie to find out.  The acting is sublime -- the expressions and vocalizations are effective even to someone like me who knows absolutely no Japanese.  The music is wonderful.  The cinematography is subtle and effective, with angles and focus chosen to emphasize the plot elements and mood.  It feels highly realistic; the samurai aren't holier-than-thou lords of the sword wielding mystical powers -- they're merely trained men in a profession, men with thoughts and feelings.  The weak and helpless villagers aren't necessarily really that week and helpless.  And we aren't inflicted with atrocities perpetrated by the baddies so that we have evidence to make us pick a side.  There are no tiresome epic battles with the the characters drawing upon mysterious wells of strength to finally prevail -- they're just fights that happen as they happen.  I could go on.  Dang, this movie was good!",Seven Samurai
465,QulkSiLvR,An undeniable essential of the cinema,10,31 August 2001,"Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, ""The Seven Samurai"", is, arguably, the greatest film of all time, in league with ""Citizen Kane"", ""Rules of the Game"", ""Battleship Potemkin"", and ""The Seventh Seal"".  It details the samurai-led defense of a small, poor Japanese village that is raided by a ruthless band of brigands.  The story is a simple one; seven hungry samurai lead the farmers in defending their village for three meals a day.  It is held up by stellar acting, beautiful cinematography, and the brilliant direction of Mr. Kurosawa.",Seven Samurai
466,Corkyman,Amazing - the Film as artform,10,17 September 2001,"Seven Samurai is one of the finest films ever committed to celluloid. Kurosawa created characters, sets, and story with such great depth, that you feel like you're right there in the village. More importantly, the film is one the earliest examples of a martial arts film that equally uses romance and drama to tell the story. It's also got action and comedy. A Brilliant piece of work that should be in everyone's Top 10.",Seven Samurai

All is perfect in this true masterpiece:the actors play godly their characters,especially (obviously) Toshiro Mifune,and even the side characters are so well portrayed that,once the show it will be over,you'll keep on remember them.And the story:so classic yet,at the same time,very charming...The movie runs for over 3 hours,but without drops,and i bet you will be hooked to the seat 'till the end (a little warning at this point:if you cared for the character played by Mifune,Kikuchiyo,as i did,be prepared to drop some tears...).In conclusion,""The Seven Samurai"" is THE movie,a true masterpiece that will last over and over in the memory of the lovers of the good cinema!",Seven Samurai
468,SLK6087,Amazing power to entertain,10,23 October 2002,"All I have to say is that I first saw this movie in an auditorium with about 150+ other first-year film students. It was required viewing for a class. I, as well as many other students I talked to then, were none too anxious to watch a 3 1/2 hour, foreign, nearly 50-year-old movie. I had only vaguely heard of Akira Kurosawa before.After the showing, I walked outside and it was like I was stuck in a daze. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't believe what I had just seen. This movie would eventually lead me to change the way I saw movies, and what constituted a great one. Now, about two years later I have seen nearly every single Kurosawa film (everyone I talked to that first saw this with me, have ALL done so, it will happen to you if you watch and enjoy this film). I have also seen this movie about ten more times, each time introducing it to someone who has never seen a Kurosawa film before. Everyone I showed it to, regardless of their movie taste, has at the least been entertained by it.
What amazes me though is how the 10th viewing of this film was just as powerful and exciting as my very first. I know no other movie I can say that of.",Seven Samurai
469,trenthouseforlife,One of my favourite films,10,19 August 2007,"Akira Kurosawa has made a lot of great films, but Seven Samurai stands above all of them as an amazing piece of storytelling. Narrative, character and action drive the plot along at such a pace that you never get tired of the film, even though it's well over 3 hours long in the original version. There are great scenes at every turn in this film and every shot looks like a painting, the composition is just superb. Action scenes are brilliantly filmed, with tracking shots and battles injecting a sense of urgency and exhilaration. The actors are all on top form, with Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura standing out from a crowd of excellent performances, producing perhaps their best work for Kurosawa.There's not much to say that hasn't been said about this film already. This is just my opinion, but it's an opinion shared by a lot of people, so I would recommend you see this film if you haven't already. It shows just how well a film can be made when the director really knows his stuff. In spite of it being a period piece set in feudal Japan, it has a genuine universality which will mean it remains a classic that is enjoyed for years to come.",Seven Samurai

Braaahahahahahahaha.",Seven Samurai
471,tymothy,Simply doesn't hold up,3,4 September 2018,"Lots of great movies stand the test of time. Seven Samurai simply doesn't. You're lying and deceiving yourself if you consider this to be a great movie.Why do people rate this so highly?1. It's in Japanese
2. It involves Samurai
3. It's old
4. Kurosawa
5. Relative obscurityAll of these factors allow people to like something non-mainstream and thus profess superiority.Look, no doubt this is a relevant film in understanding the evolution of moviemaking. But historical significance alone doesn't make for a great film. While various action shots might have been ground-breaking for the time and stunning to audiences in the 50s, they simply don't hold up decades later.The movie is extraordinarily long- well clearly, we must get a great character development of the Samurai then? Nope. Hardly anything. Fantastic dialog? Nope. Perhaps the subtitles weren't great, but discourse is extremely shallow most of the time.A real emotional involvement? A sense of urgency? Excitement? Nope. Aside from fleeting moments in the first two hours and a little later on, you get almost nothing. There's a persistent and constant malaise as characters slog through the plot.Instead the movie lags and relies on portraying mediocre sets and ""action"". I'm sure audiences in the 50s would consider the film almost immersive into various landscrapes. As a modern movie goer, a few fake trees with a backdrop isn't engaging by itself. A character falling into a pile of fake flowers shot in blakc and white does nothing for me.So yes, if you watch this you'll see the development of interesting camera techniques that would become staples of work to follow. But as a movie, bleh, terrible pacing, shallow characters and a work that falls flat emotionally. And that's the opposite what good movies are supposed to be- entertainment through delivery of a compelling story.If you want to see a Kurosawa film that still holds up, look at ""Only the Bad Sleep Well"", which has some absolutely fantastic camerawork, an engaging plot and delivers a gripping story.",Seven Samurai
472,Oblivious93,A Movie That Deserves Every Ounce of Hype it Gets,10,23 April 2009,"Created by acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa, Seven Samurai tells the story of a small farming town that is under the threat of bandits in feudal Japan. If the farmers resist the bandits, they will be killed, but if they stand by and do nothing, all of their food and money will be stolen. And so the poor farmers decide they must stop the bandits by hiring a group of seven very different samurai.Each samurai has a distinct personality and reason for helping the farmers, and the film takes it's time (3 hours and 27 minutes time) to explain each of them. However the runaway star is Kikuchiyo, played by actor Toshiro Mifune. He is the black sheep of the group, a crazed and energetic man who almost seems like a little child. But throughout the course of the film, you see his other side, and by the end you've got one of the most developed characters ever to appear on the big screen.Seven Samurai is considered by many to be an action movie, but shoving it into one genre is unfair. The movie seamlessly combines moments of comedy, drama, romance, adventure, action, and even tragedy. It is a movie of all trades.Words cannot sum up the experience you have while watching Seven Samurai. It makes you laugh at the antics the samurai bring, cheer when the village accomplish a goal, bit your fingernails in suspense when bandits appear, and cry at the tragedies that occur in life. If you have yet to see this movie, find it and watch what is without a doubt in my mind, the greatest movie ever made.",Seven Samurai
473,coolhive,Almost Perfect!,9,17 June 2002,"This film only loses one point from being a perfect 10 because it starts off too slow.  If I remember correctly, I felt the first 30-40 minutes really dragged.  After that, hold on!  I love the rest of the film and feel this is Kurasawa's best film. He is a true master of his art and I  can't wait to get the DVD.",Seven Samurai
474,Mandrakegray,The Best Movie Of All Time!!,10,20 October 2003,"Here's a movie that simply leaves me floored each and every time I view it... Kurosawa directs the action and drama with equal mastery...in my opinion (and with all due respect to Hitchcock, Kubrick and Spielberg) he is the greatest director of all time...as this epic clearly shows.Then there is the presence of the peerless Toshiro Mifune...playing a samurai that is a far cry from the worldly, experienced warrior he played in his future Kurosawa pairings that made him an international star.
Perhaps the aspect of the film that still resonates with movie buffs worldwide (along with the great battle scenes) is the universal appeal of the story. The list of greats that mention being inspired by this movie is long and impressive...if you've never seen this classic, make it a priority...you'll soon be adding your accolades to these pages.

475,mynameismud,A True Masterpiece,9,30 January 2003,"Seven Samurai is one of those movies that any fan of Japanese cinema or large scale epics should see.Everything about this film is excellent,the story,the characters,the performances,and of course the battle sequences.This is truly a masterwork of Akira Kurosawa and a gem of Japanese cinema.The undeniable spirit of this film will leave you feeling that you have experienced something truly special and it will stay with you for a long time.This being the inspiration for such classic westerns as 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly', 'Seven Samurai' is definately a work before its time and showed the strength of what the Japanese can do in the world of film-making.This film broke new ground and has stood the test of time for over fifty years.Toshiro Mifune plays one of his most legendary Kurosawa roles and delivers an hysterically humerous and blisteringly intense performance.This to me,is a flawless epic that has the brilliant mix of action and philosophy that only Akira Kurosawa can deliver.A true masterpiece",Seven Samurai
476,gearmod,Seven Ronin,10,6 November 2009,"I haven't read all the comments posted here on this film, there are currently more than 470, so I'm not certain if this aspect of the film has been covered, and I apologize if this comment is redundant.The sheer scale of humanity this film portrays is epic; it is developed with depth and detail in a mere 3.5 hours the finest film allows without squandering one frame, and there are countless degrees to the depth.One degree of depth to consider when viewing this film is the seven samurai are Ronin; samurai without masters.A samurai could lose a master due to the master's death, financial ruin, or by simply getting fired, i.e., losing favor. Regardless of how the samurai became a Ronin, while he retains the skills, dignity, and honor earned as a samurai, there still remains an unspoken stigma that is portrayed as a listlessness, or melancholy, of the samurai at the beginning of the film.With this in mind, the importance of the common cause these seven have rallied around, that helps transform them, is emphasized. They become so immersed in the cause they forget their recent past except perhaps during quite times of reflection.By the end of the film they have become full again; full of joy serving a master even if it is, in their eyes, lowly farmers, and their joy is mirrored in the joy of the farmers planting the rice once again.I have only seen this film a few times in the last 30 years, I've been studying Japanese history and culture for the last several years, and this aspect of the film became more apparent to me the most recent time I watched it.",Seven Samurai
477,diggerjohn111,quite possibly the greatest.,10,2 October 2004,"This is possibly the greatest film ever made. Samurai has influenced every one from Kubrick to Spielberg and Lucas. How can you say anything bad about a film by the greatest master of film, Kurosawa? I think Kurosawa's greatest achievement in this film is the fact that he managed to make the viewer ""see the color"" in a black and white film. I think this film also shows that you do not need a billion dollar budget to make an amazing work of art. Akira Kurosawa can best be described as a director that has a film genre all to himself that directors can emulate, but can never duplicate. The ideas of the film were also revolutionary, the notion that a samurai can show human weakness was a new one in Japan at the time the film was made. Kurosawa not only gave the Age of Japanese Shogunate wars a human face, he also made it presentable to the Western film viewer. There is nothing in this film that any human being cannot sympathize with and I think that is the greatest gift that this film, and the entire collection of Kurosawa's films give to the world.",Seven Samurai
478,welck74,Impressive for it's time.,9,24 March 2004,"Last night here in the Netherlands I saw a cleaned up re-release of the Seven Samurai. Knowing what I know from the period it was made, I was very impressed.Although the first time you will see this movie you will notice it's quirky nature being almost, unintentionally, humorous. Also you will notice the slow build up (the movie is 204 minutes long so it's quite a sit through) and long shots.Now, for supporting my arguments for it's brilliance, here a small list of movies made at around the same time from the top 10:Rear Window, North by Northwest, 12 Angry Men, Sunset Blvd., Paths of Glory, Vertigo, All About Eve, Some Like It Hot, Singin' in the Rain. If you see the Seven Samurai in the light of the style of these movies you will see it's brilliance and originality.When I saw Seven Samurai it felt like I was looking at a black and white from the seventies. It's depth, grittyness and cinematography where not like anything ever seen at the time. The slow motion shots of people struck by the sword. The accurate historical correctness of the period and people it portays. The human depth of the (japanese) characters. These things make it one of the great movies.To use a samurai's point of view; you could see it as a movie which lost it's original sharp edge but realize it's edge was only lost because of a hundred other movies it inspired to wield the same ideas.",Seven Samurai
479,wallyworm,Excellent Film,10,28 August 2004,"Regarding some of the comments downgrading this film- 2 quick points. First, I think this film is high drama, great comedy, intense, has story complexity, and shows a side of Japanese culture few in the West get to see. Second, while film opinion must have a subjective side- whether you like a film or not, think it's exciting or boring- there must be an objective side, as well. You have to take the film for what it is, not what you want it to be. Keep in mind the year the film was made, don't expect Terminator special effects, and try to remember that so much of what we see today was influenced by this film and this director. There are pre-Kurosawa Westerns and post-Kurosawa Westerns put out by Hollywood, and the difference is obvious. Clint Eastwood made a name for himself playing the American version of Mifune's samurai, and with much less wit and charisma. And I like Clint Eastwood. No big deal, though, just my 2 cents.",Seven Samurai

This movie is a work of art, with Kurosawa being able to tell an absolutely engaging story that will hook you for every single second throughout the 3h30m run-time.Every single frame feels like a picture that could be hung up somewhere and would be considered a beautiful shot, a piece of art.This movie is a once-in-a-lifetime experience to watch and will, with the exception of Akira Kurosawas other works, never be matched.",Seven Samurai
481,jh_reaper,The greatest epic of all time by none other than the Kurosawa.,10,5 April 2007,"This film is not complicated by any means but is done with true brilliance. The story is simple > a band of samurai are hired by a poor farming community to fight off bandits which have been stealing their crops and starving them.Akira Kurosawa has shown me time and time again that he's easily one of the best directors to have ever walked this Earth. I dare one to show me any film much better than Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Throne Of Blood, Ran, Dreams or Red Beard just to name a small number of his dozen or so true masterpieces of cinema.Back on topic to my review of Seven Samurai.Seven Samurai is something that everyone can relate to and deals with general topics like trying to help your fellow man when he's down.The film may be 3 and a 1/2 hours in length but it flows with such a pace that you are never left bored even for a moment and when it's all done with you don't think of how long you just sit for, but of how great of a film you just sit through.This is helped by how it blends in some of the most true emotional moments you'll ever see along with some very intense (especially for it's time) battle scenes as the Samurai and the Bandits are battling it out in the climax.You feel each moment and there are quite a few that bring you to the screen like a magnet as well as many that almost bring one to tears thanks to some of the best actors that Japan can offer and the best possible performances that anyone could possibly expect from each, which most notably includes the legendary Toshiro Mifune (whom Kurosawa often worked with) as Kikuchiyo.The script is superb and manages to not be complicated but yet avoid the disaster of becoming too plain or mundane. The acting is some of the finest that one will ever witness. The film is beautifully shot. The action is done as it should be and the emotion feels real and is truly there. Last but not least Akira Kurosawa's direction brings everything together like a true perfectionist.I am not the best at reviewing but to sum up my feelings toward this movie I must say I've currently seen it four times and it has never let me down. Each time I've experienced this film I've truly been enthralled with each moment and I've really cared for each character and Toshiro Mifune's performance has both put a smile on my face and a tear to my eye.I honestly believe this is the finest film that has ever been made regardless of country, length, age or genre. I will continue re-watching this film till the day I die. I have very much respect to Kurosawa for creating some of the most amazing films I've ever seen, Same goes to Mifune for his acting.For those new to Akira Kurosawa's film work I would highly recommend going and immediately getting copies of Red Beard, Rashomon and Ran or pretty much any film he directed for that matter.Seven Samurai very deservingly receives a 10/10 in my opinion and is one of the greatest films ever made.",Seven Samurai
482,gocanes146,Excellent classic all time,10,11 February 2012,"The samurai themselves are so richly given life to in the screenplay that little more would have been needed to make them memorable characters, yet the main cast pay off at every turn, and though every one of the seven main actors give in perfect performances (never as I had feared before watching it do you confuse them, even in the chaotic battle scenes), two immortal roles have a particularly resounding effect: Takashi Shimura (Kambei Shimada), who plays the leader of the ragged band of samurai, gives his sage and venerable warrior a god-like intensity that makes the magnetic charisma of his character unquestionable. One of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making. Stealing the show however, albeit by a very thin margin, is longtime Kurosawa favorite coworker Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) as the rogue seventh, the black sheep of the herd, giving the bravura ultimate performance of a lifetime paved throughout with great roles.The story follows them and the villagers, equally nuanced and developed, through their encounter, training, eventual bonding and the big inevitable fight for survival. Unlike subsequent very successful remakes (i.e. Magnificent Seven), seven Samurai transcended excellency by having many layers (nothing or no one is white or black: everything exists in shades of gray) and thus being very real and human. Even without the menace, its interpersonal dynamics would have made it perfect human drama, subtle, balancing comedy, intensity, realism, drama and a deep philosophy with astonishing ease, yet the menace does materialize and thus Seven Samurai unleashes its violence in a series of action scenes crafted with such vision and ingenuity as has ever reached an action film (the frenetic battle scenes at the end rather evoke Saving Private Ryan in their relentlessness).In the end, what made this into solid gold was, at the core, Akira Kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Red Beard, Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, Ran), would never top this one. Throughout his life, Kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. If so, Seven Samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. One of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite.",Seven Samurai
483,ohiodude,Quite simply the best,10,8 June 2013,"There are few films that have influenced so many others as Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. From John Sturges' direct remake The Magnificent Seven to countless war and heist movies. This is the original story of a ragtag group of misfit warriors who band together to save a bunch of innocents from the scourge of society--in this case a group of marauding bandits. If you've seen this movie once, you've seen it a thousand times.The ragtag group of samurai have all the classic character backgrounds-- the leader who is experienced but weary, a novice samurai seeking to prove himself, the skilled archer and defensive mastermind, the long- lost former lieutenant to the leader, the comic whose skills are limited, the stoic swordsman and the temperamental peasant who seeks to prove his worth. Any of these characters sound familiar? In any story of a small group of would-be heroes seeking to defend the honor of innocents, you'll find a variation of this exact group. It's knowing that it was done here first and most originally that makes it so great. I'm not one for spoilers, so I will just say that with this framework and to date one of the most original screenplays ever written, this movie is perfect. See it...now.",Seven Samurai

This is way overrated due to those who want to sound more clever and pretend they actually enjoy something that is ever so slow and long. In fact, this movie has lost any kind of interest. No it has not aged well at all!! Believe me, I like some black and white movies such as Charlie Chaplin's, or even that recent Pie (the number)one. The other day I watched King Kong, and however clumsy the special effects of the time were, it only gives a special dated kick to it (and some of the dinosaurs fight are quite surprisingly awesome as you get used to the general texture of the time.With this one you are just in for boredom and disappointment. It's almost silent for three and a half hours and the fights are theatrically overacted it is ridiculous. Sure this movie was something in 1954, before Star Wars, Aliens, Lord of the rings and Akira (among others), but I believe that to actually enjoy that one, you would need to be a historian of cinema, with a strong knowledge of everything that was happening surrounding the movie, which might provide you with a light that I haven't found.I don't see the point! There does seem to be a consensus that the age of a movie compensates for its shortcomings. I don't think so!! It certainly is part of the reason, but it doesn't make it less boring!So come on!

Seven Samurai is a classic that will be watched by any generation in any period of time and will be accepted as a cinematic masterpiece. Although the film spawns out over three and a half hours, once a viewer is caught up in the many aspects of the film such as true character development, the culmination of relationships and ever mounting progression towards the stories climax, time becomes of no importance! Akira's methods of engulfing the overall plot into many different aspects of characters lives which involve love, hatred, leadership and the ability of a community to come together as one too fight the common enemy. I have read many reviews which are critical as to the length of the film.I however find that only a matter of one's lack of attention span. This is one of those movies that you much watch with an attentive attitude to understand the overall effect on cinematic history.

One of the many remarkable things about Akira Kurosawa's astonishing historical epic is the fact that at nearly 3 and a half hours it never drags for a single second of it's length. Not one bit. That fact alone is testament to Kurosawa's incredible skill as both writer and director. The balance of artful visuals and narrative is perfect and every character is fascinating and perfectly played, especially Toshiro Mifune's gleeful and almost feral glory hound and Takashi Shimura's good hearted but wily Ronin.

487,macbug-1,Akira Kurosawa is one of the great film makers of all time,10,21 August 2005,"This movie should be seen by everyone who ever considers going into the film making business. Akira Kurosawa has created an true epic motion picture that is not only historically perfect down to the smallest detail but has presented a moral philosophical film with many layers of messages. For later contemplation. This is my personal all time favorite movie. The quality is so intense that colorization would ruin this film, every scene is nuanced, and full of subtleties that escape most western viewers so one must carefully watch this film several times, it is worthy of a full semester of study in any film school. My favorite scene is a dual in the early stage of the movie that was copied in the Magnificent Seven Film but in the Seven Samari Kurosawa shows us a slice of the interactions of the Samari Class of 17th Century Japan. Another great message in the film is how fire arms and technology have poisoned conflict and warfare. I mean in the film Kurosawa displays the training nobility, courage, and skill of the Samari against overwhelming odds. Yet since the bandits have firearms they are able to kill them without every showing themselves in a very cowardly manner, in fact you never see them firing and killing any of the Samari, you only hear the report and you see a brave Noble man fall. No more is strength, nobility, training, dedication, honor, sacrifice and commitment important, now it is who has the most money to buy guns.Kurosawa is the master film maker who has taught Spielberg, Lucas and all following filmmakers who take their craft seriously. By slowly consuming this film you journey into the mind of a true genius, beyond cleverness, or big budgets, you can see Kurosawa's finger prints on many of our most populars films.",Seven Samurai

Great story line, lots of fighting, and acting that appears both serious and comic to the Western viewer.  I have watched this half a dozen times.

With great films like Ran, Ikiru, and Rashomon, this film stands out to me as his masterpiece.  It is about a small village that needs the protection of seven samurais against a horde of bandits. This film has every single quality that makes a great movie.  This is one of the films that you must see!  I believe it is probably the best film I have seen so far.",Seven Samurai

Seven samurai 1954 by Kurosawa is a legendary saga, the shotselectoin is incredible! The story, the characters, all of them are amazing. Story plot evaluate very good, i didn't see any plot hole, this movie isn't an ordinary story, just see the villager characterize, they aren't absolutely innocent! The villagers also have a bad side.

This proves that the director, Akira Kurosawa is a genius! Too bad he's gone now... Toshiro Mifune was of course, fantastic, like in every one of his movies.

496,caerlas,A masterful arena film,9,26 July 2003,"Contains Spoiler I'd heard about this film for a long time. I am glad I finally saw it. This is the story of a village of people in post-feudal Japan who hire a ronin, Kambei, to defend their village from an annual raid by bloodthirsty bandits. Out of charity and a lack of purpose since the fall of the feudal lords he helps them find 6 other ronin to defend the village. These 6 other ronin are just as indifferent about their lives as the first and decide to take on the challenge of defending this village as well. Among the more compelling characters are Katsushiro, a young untrained son of a samurai who wishes to be a disciple under Kambei. Kikuchiro, played with flair by Toshiro Mifune is a scoundrel who poses as a samurai. Despite Kikuchiro's lack of discipline or honor, and his constant vulgar outbursts, he becomes one of the most endearing characters throughout the course of the movie because of his slyness and unstoppable bravery. Also look out for Heihachi, a fiercely disciplined ronin who has made the perfection of his swordsmanship the one remaining meaning in his life.The movie is a whopping 3 1/2 hours long. Strangely enough I didn't have a real problem staying up till 4 a.m. to watch it. This movie is an arena film in the truest sense of the word. The story is not about one character but an entire circle of people both of the village and of the samurai. Their stories are very separate in some ways but intertwined in their will to fight and survive. Throw in Kurosawa's usual talent for well arranged shots, dark humor, and moments of brilliant direction of his actors, and you have a heck of a good show.The movie lagged in areas especially closer to the beginning. The movie is truly made after the intermission when the build-up has ended and the real conflict begins. One key scene in the first half makes it all worth it when Toshiro Mifune gives a stunning monologue criticizing the samurai for their hatred of the farmers after discovering the past murders of other wandering ronin by the farmers. Toshiro up to this point plays a reprehensible and un-compelling character who mainly serves as comic relief, but afterward is discovered to be a spirit of truth amidst a personality filled with pain and chaos.The ending is bittersweet much like Yojimbo. The samurai, mission completed, still have no lord and no purpose, so onward they travel perhaps only to die in another challenge. Nonetheless, there is something very fulfilling about the end that I often don't feel from most movies. Overall, I highly recommend this film. If you like things in small bites then watch each half a day at a time.",Seven Samurai

I was apprehensive because of it's high rating and I thought I might be disappointed but the film was absolutely riveting! The English sub-titles in no way diminished from the enjoyment of this film! Tremendous camera angles, directing and editing are all the best. The film does a great job of developing all of the characters, and really is a thought-provoking work of art; it's one of those movies that I thought about for a long time after watching it.

It took me a long time deciding to trim my choices to only 5 Top Feel Good Movies among over 100 movies I have seen, because there are many movies that made me feel good. ""Seven Samurai"" is one of those Five. I watched ""Seven Samurai"" twice. The first time I watched it, I told the man beside me that its my first time to watch it. I asked him if he had seen it. He said, ""Yes, ten times!"" I asked, ""where?"" He replied, ""in Japan""!If you liked ""Sanjuro"" very much, you'll also like ""Seven Samurai"". If there will be another screening in the future, I would love to watch Sanjuro & Seven Samurai again and invite my friends who haven't seen those (and even those who have). Its that good even though its black & white and you have to read the English words at the screen's bottom center.I watched 6 of the 21 Akira Kurasawa films shown for FREE in the last 2 weeks of September 2010 in 2 theaters. I rated Seven Samurai=10, Sanjuro=10, Rashomon=8, Yojimbo=8, Ikiru=8 and Throne of Blood=8.Bonus on ""Sanjuro"": Sanjuro is the sequel of Yojimbo.

500,Fellowship Films,Kurosawa's Masterpiece,10,26 March 2002,"The Seven Samurai is a genuine epic notable for the simplicity of its plot and action and the complexity of the character development. In 16th century Japan and in the age of upheaval and civil disorder, seven, as it were freelance, samurai warriors are employed by desperate villagers to protect them from the annual raid on their crops and produce by a group of bandits. This is the stuff of westerns and was remade as the respectable ""The Magnificent Seven"". But what the American film lacked was the code and honour of the samurai- qualities unknown to employed gunfighters. By emphasising these things along with the Japanese caste system and thus revealing the paradox of samurai warriors fighting and dying for peasants, people whom normally they would treat with disdain, Kurosawa presented a story that was simultaneously familiar and alien. The climatic, rain-soaked, mud-spattered battle scene with the camera swooping and wheeling between samurai, peasants and bandits is brutally realistic. The overall blend of savagery and nobility, subtlety and broad humour makes what is essentially an action/adventure movie into something quite magnificent.",Seven Samurai
501,cadrega_82,All in Japanese!!!!!!!!,9,1 December 2007,"Had been looking forward to seeing this film for some time as my film studies lecturer at Bangor Uni used to rave about Kawasaki's films all the time. This is the 1st Kawasaki film I've seen and I can honestly say I don't want to bother with any others. If it was dubbed it might have notched my approval rating up another mark but this is all in Japanese and so you have to keep pressing pause to read all the dialogue - yep! There's a load of talking in this film - and towards the end my thumb was aching so much that I could hardly be bothered. What was supposed to be a 3hr 10min film became, with all the necessary freeze-framing, a whopping 5 and a half hours. Not bad if you have four eyes or no job to go to in the morning. This is not a PATCH on any of the readily available dubbed Japanese films like Bruce and Ang Lee's efforts. Was prepared to give it a go, under the illusion that even though it is in B&W there must be some pretty impressive fight scenes to justify its reputation, but was left sorely disappointed. The acting is totally unrealistic: everyone just shouts angrily at each other. At one point the village is stunned because some guy is chopping his bobble off - WHAT? For real fans of Japanese cinema I recommend Tom Cruise's virtuoso performance in The Last Samurai. Defintitely give this one a miss, unless you have a beard and glasses and want to dupe a girl into thinking you're cultured as part of some bourgeois seduction technique - but be warned, she might just DIE OF BOREDOM.",Seven Samurai

504,sselvaganesh,Akira Kurosawa was born to make this movie.......,10,1 June 2010,"Akira Kurosawa was born to make this movie. Yes it might look exaggerating. But that's a damn fact. Start to finish directors talk of maintaining the tempo. This film does that with ease. Kurosawa's famous rain scenes appear without fail here too. The director always maintains logic in these rain scenes by not having dialogs. Mountainous terrain as the backdrop was just too good a setting for the story. It was 1954 and it took great courage to take shots that covered such wide angles. Also till the final bandit-attack and villagers' retaliation sequence not many will understand why this movie has been set in the backdrop of hills. Kurosawa's regular cast appear here too. Its a pity that even IMDb doesn't have their photos so i am not able to mention their names. Speaking of individual performances, the farmer who has a horrified look on his face through out the movie was a masterly casting idea by the director to say as though someone is traveling with us throughout our journey of the movie giving some part of the bandit-fear to us. That gave an ultimate feel of the movie. The role of Kyuzo was of course brilliant. The real samurai class. No fear whatsoever. Though Kikuchiyo role was quite emotional one cannot hide the fact it sometimes was irritating. Shichinin no samurai must probably be the best movie ever made in this genre of action/adventure/thriller/drama considering that at the time it was made even the great Psycho was not made so there was no reference to make a masterpiece movie.Watch Shichinin no samurai for fun and get completely surprised.",Seven Samurai

This is the best of the best among all the movies I have seen in my life.One of the reason I like, which I believe differs from yours, is that Kurosawa(the director) described the nature of the Japanese.  If you see the file, you will notice farmers do not know how to fight, how to defend their family.  The defense is one of the key instinct functions though.  They asked samurais for help.This film reminds me of the Gulf war in 1990.  America and England started the war against Iraq.  While American soldiers I thought were scared of poison gas attack by Iraq, the Japanese government made huge financial contributions.  O.K. money is important, but absolutely no solders were sent from Japan.  ""Let them do the dirty work, but we will pay money.""So, the farmers are Japanese.  The samurai-s are American.  That's how I see.",Seven Samurai

This film changed me in a very deep and profound way, before i watched this film i would barely sit still for any B&W film let alone one with subtitles...yet this film drew tears from my eyes the first time i watched it. I shall not bore you with the technical details as im sure there are others more eloquent who can lay down Kurosawa's editing, shot transitions and directing style but i shall mention what happens on-screen a little. I am aware that some people HATE this film but its a case of looking at it with the right eyes.I watched the film, alone on a grey rainy day (which was perfect) and i was swept away. The build up of the characters is prolonged so you feel like you are watching people not figures in a story and when some of those people die you feel absolute and genuine loss. The action is swift and brutal and not overdone (no stupid, Chinese-movie, flips and spins with people dangling from wires upside down over a pond) the power of the sword and musket show how easily death can come. it is an lifechanging epic in every sense....i cant remember what i was like before it.This is NOT a boring film if you like well developed characters and subtle plots and emotion that give depth and meaning to the narrative. if you think its boring just because you are used to Hollywood trash that lasts 90 minutes and has an explosion, pair of tits, killer robot or ninja every 30 minutes to keep your brain interested then your argument falls flat??? perhaps you should go and watch 'Doomsday' that seemed to keep the average spotty teenager happy and awake with the usual ""Cor dat was wicked"" spoken afterwards. this film requires a commitment....its not merely another popcorn movie to watch it demands so much more of you than that!lets face it the best dinners are made in the oven not the microwave. the best paintings take the longest to create. the best cars are those well made with love and attention to detail....this film embodies all those aspects! YES IT IS LONG but if you can concentrate and don't suffer from A.D.D. you will Love it!if not then go watch a microwave movie with lots of flashing colours and movement like 'Doomsday' or 'Blade' or maybe even cartoons that would get 10 stars from you no doubt!!!",Seven Samurai

508,runkelcorey,"Thrilling, interesting, beautiful, and unexpectedly funny.",10,10 July 2012,"Coming in at over three hours, and being set in 1500s feudal Japan, Seven Samurai is a true historical epic. It may not have gone many exotic places, much of it in one tiny village, but hey, neither did Titanic. But it's epic status is not what sets it apart from the rest; no, rather is its dramatic storyline and subplots, as well as very likable leads. Kurosawa's script (also a writer here) doesn't play this up as a period piece, thankfully refraining from anachronisms, and it says fresh in 2012 (although it was probably re-subtitled with the DVD release a few years ago). It also shows the Japanese humor that Kurosawa eagerly portrays in some scenes--genuinely funny, I might add--even if not full on comedy quality (it is a drama after all).After the opening credits, which features great drum based music, showcasing Japanese culture and the action element of Seven Samurai, we see a group of bandits about to pillage a village positioned in a basin with sides made of mountains, frequently demanding that the villagers pay them to keep them safe. A farmer from this small farming town overhears their conversation to come back when the harvest is over. A leader from the village suggests hiring samurai to protect them, ones that will take rice and shelter as compensation. So we see a down-on-his-luck veteran-samurai negotiating and freeing a child from harm, and a representative from the village asks for help. After much persuading the samurai accepts, but says the job will require at least seven. Next, we track down four more, a good natured one that is often the source of comic relief, and a master swordsman, who's quiet, yet well spoken, with philosophical lines. A villager is accepted to the brotherhood. Finally, a clown of a man, seldom not drunk at the beginning, who begs to come along, and they reluctantly accept.After this rich exposition, the committee tasked with finding the samurai return victorious, and you next expect a great celebration, possibly even a feast (this is a town where the villagers seldom eat rice out of season, only millet). Much to the chagrin of the seven, there is no outpouring, not even people in the streets. The men with daughters and/or wives, are protecting them from who they think are going to rape them. The rest are simply afraid. So the wild card, the fool among masters, sounds the alarm bells in the village square. After all the peoples fear the worst and come out to defend themselves, the samurai delivers a wonderfully pointed speech about how they did not come to be feared and hated by the townspeople, but to provide a great service for below minimal payment scolding them for indecency and generalizations, and more than anything, whining about it, too.The next half hour or so, is showing the village and collected samurai readying for defense (traps, positioning, and the like), and teaching the villagers how to defend themselves with a sword or spear. And a lovely romance too scandalous for public approval, this is the only part that would gain a significant amount if in color. The picturesque setting with its wonderful fall setting, with leaves on the ground, a small stream and presumed cherry blossoms for this great love story: Technicolor would have just made your heart sing.But of all the things in this movie that are good, nothing beats the last hour, an all out battle: bandits versus the magnificent seven (yes, this is where that came from). I can't overstate it enough, of all the movies I've seen with battles or even wars in it, nothing, not even the brilliant western shootouts from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, can top this, not one second could be beaten by almost any other fights in the history of cinema. You may not like the long, suspense and plot building drama that precedes it, but no one can deny the masterpiece that is this battle. As a stand-alone movie, it would still be pretty good (and probably not too short, either).Long movie short, Akira Kurosawa's rich character development and perennially likable personalities (it seems as though a different person wrote each part, they're really that built up), along with what is the all time greatest battle I've ever seen, easily and gracefully earns Shichinin no samurai a high place in anyone's movie collection. http://woltzpictures.wordpress.com/",Seven Samurai

I saw it today for the first time and this is a terrific film!Yes, it is long, but it is compelling the whole way through.  The characters are terrific, the cinematography is beautiful and the plot is one of the most influential in movie history.  I've recently seen The Magnificent Seven too and while I liked it alot, it is not as good as Seven Samurai.  I thing one thing people are missing is the context of when it was made.  People didn't make movies like this in 1954.  When I compare it to other classics of the same era (Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Bridge on the River Kwai, On the Waterfront), it compares very favorably.  While I haven't seen any of Kurosawa's more modern films, my guess is he more than makes up for many of the criticisms listed by those here.Give this movie a shot.

The movie is slow and boring; the acting is truly awful (with a couple of exceptions); and most of the (lame) action doesn't come until the end of this overlong borefest. I watched the restored 206 minute version, so maybe this was part of the problem. Although I'm not sure an edited version would have been any better. All this hokum about this being the greatest action/adventure movie of all time should not be believed!! It's not even close! I only give it 2/10.

Akira Kurosawa's epic tale about bravery and honor is three and a half hours in length, but i assure you, not a single second of this film is wasted. Kurosawa spends 2 and a half hours developing his characters in a way that in unrivaled by any other film. He develops and intense mob mentality of fear and selfishness in the peasants, that he masterfully contrasts with the brave, self sacrificing actions of the Seven Samurai. And so, after over 150 minutes of careful character development, Kurosawa ends the film with a one hour battle scene, that is not defined by intense action sequences, but by acts of valor and sacrifice, that truly bring the characters full circle. I strongly recommend this film, and i hope that the ""black and white"" barrier that plagues most movie goers would not stop them from watching this movie.

However, as soon as I actually settled down to watch it I was captivated from start to finish and the 3 hours flew past!!!

There are so many different personalities and all provide something different to the group's dynamic. You cannot help to be amused by the antics of Toshiro Mifune as Kikuchiyo!!!

While Akira Kurosawa is a great director and he deserves all the credit he is given, I feel a true genius behind Seven Samurai is almost forgotten. He can be found on the credits: composer Fukio HayasakaHis score for Seven Samurai is one of the best I have ever heard. Unfortunately he died 1955 just a year after the release of this world wide success film. What a famous career he could have made after this success!Audience relates to the villagers, the samurai and the plot through the simple themes and melodies created by Hayasaka. The main theme splendidly captivates the melancholic stoic heroism of the samurai. The secret love scenes between the apprentice nad the village girl create an enchanting atmosphere.Hayasama should be ranked right up there with Miklos Rosza, John Williams, Ennio Morricone and Maurice Jarre.",Seven Samurai

I've seen quite a few civil war movies, Seppuku ('62), Onibaba ('64), Sanjuro ('62) and nearly all of Kurosawa's flicks, but the difference in them and the Seven Samurai lies in its experience. A good one hour into the movie and you'd want to live with the characters, fight with the samurais, curse the bandits and fall in love with a girl. The storyline of this movie is of epic proportions, not even close to any movie you'd have encountered till now, and the way the minutest element of the film is handled, it just makes you sit and appreciate in awe. Every character is portrayed as if we've been living with them for years, just that they're now on screen instead of being with us. A sign of a good movie is that it lasts, a sign of an excellent movie is that it lasts longer, while a sign for a movie like this is that it'll embed itself in your mind and heart for a long long time to come, and you'll cherish every moment remembering it.

518,phoenix-ks,One of the Best Movies ever!,10,27 March 2005,This is Akira Kurosawa's (one of the greatest directors ever) greatest masterpiece. It is film-making at its best. With amazing performances across the board (my personal favorite was Toshiro Mifune) it has some of the most memorable characters of all times. However the best thing about the movie is the direction Kurosawa captures every moment of the film perfectly. There is not a single wasted frame in its entire 3 and a half hours. It jumps straight into its magnificent story with its opening shot of a villager witnessing a group of bandits decision to attack and rob the village. The villagers then proceed to hire 7 Samurai to protect the village. But that is not the only plot in the movie their are a number of subplots. Some of the most memorable scenes in the movie are the 3 battles which are some of the most amazingly filmed in history. I highly recommend this movie as it is unbelievably entertaining and should be required viewing for any film buff. If you haven't seen this movie yet go rent it and watch it as soon as you can!,Seven Samurai
519,erandy-894-944418,Absolutely amazing,10,11 January 2014,"Seven Samurai is a masterpiece, there's no doubt about it. While it's not necessarily my favorite film by Akira Kurosawa, it is definitely his most powerful work. Toshiro Mifune steals the entire movie, Kikuchiyo is a character that no one can forget. He has a great deal of character development and has the most investment in the battle. The conclusion of his life is nothing short of heroic. The style Kurosawa brings to this, like all of his films, is outstanding. Everything is extremely well planned and precise. The look of the film is utterly beautiful, the final battle is perfectly dark and tragic. There is an incredible sense of imagery that cannot be forgotten as well. I think it's a movie that everyone should sit down and see at least once. It is truly an epic, clocking in at 3 1/2 hours, but it goes by so fast that you don't even notice it.",Seven Samurai
520,saronix,A Fine Film,10,18 March 2017,"Seven Samurai directed by Akira Kurosawa is the quintessential action flick. However, simply citing it as an action film is to discredit the comedy, tragedy, drama and humanistic qualities it possesses. It is the blue-print for any film that assembles a team of heroes with a common goal.It has an extensive run-time that flies by and rewards those that were not intimidated by a 3 hour and 30 minute film. This time is well utilized to flesh out the characters and there is not a single scene that felt like ""padding."" Despite there being an array of characters, many of these characters are fleshed out and well developed and their struggles and successes evoke strong emotions from the viewer.The strength of this film lies in the characters. For instance, we have Kambei (Takashi Shimura), the noble and wise leader of the troupe. Kambei is approached by a representative of the village asking for help in protecting the village from bandits that constantly raid them for resources. Despite the village offering a pittance for this service, Kambei is empathetic and decides to take on the job but is now faced with the difficult task of assembling other warriors that would risk their lives for little monetary value.Each character has their own motivations for joining this rag-tag group and many of them have a character arc that develops them. These are no one-dimensional 'face-less' warriors that are characteristic of many films.In contrast, the bandits are an ever present ominous threat but are not developed in any significant way. They are a concern to the village but ultimately they are a device which sets in motion the foundation of assembling this rag-tag group. This allows the focus to be on the protagonists, their relationships to each other and how they react when faced with adversity.The bandits are given no more development than a natural cause; such as an earthquake or tsunami. They are an ever present threat but are a product of the environment for a small defenceless village composed of peasants and farmers. This is for the betterment of the film; as ultimately the film is about the villagers and seven samurai - not about the bandits.Each character was well acted and enjoyable. However, I have to acknowledge Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune for their performances as the characters Kambei and Kikuchiyo respectively. These characters had excellent chemistry with others on screen and contrasted each other well.In summary, this is a must watch film. The run time may intimidate some viewers although you will be rewarded with one of the most humanistic and ingenious films ever made that does justify the length, utilizes it, and turns it into a strength.",Seven Samurai
521,stpierre-1,Wow! Incredible movie!,10,11 May 2005,"After being somewhat disappointed by Rashomon, I came into this movie without high expectations. What a mistake. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen -- bar none. Was it three and a half hours long? I didn't notice.Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune turn in absolutely incredible performances, especially Shimura; where both (I felt) overacted in Rashomon, Mifune fits wonderfully into his role and Shimura is flat out brilliant as the restrained master. Even the stoic swordsman -- I can't recall his name -- was a stock character, but acted to perfection.Some reviews complain about the action sequences, but I found them brilliant because -- get ready for this, Gladiator fans -- they were *realistic.* They accurately depicted the fights as they would be between a handful of terrified farmers with bamboo spears and a handful of terrified bandits with secondhand swords: messy and inelegant. The samurai, too, fight accurately: they wait for their opening and strike fatally. There's none of the half-hour one-on-one knife fights you get in modern ""action epics""; no one gets hacked to bits and keeps on going, and I appreciated the hell out of that.The ending, though, was the most brilliant part. If it weren't for the last two minutes and Shimura's cynical (but true!) closing comment, this would be a typical, though outstanding, action film. The last two minutes -- and the trademark twist that Kurosawa throws into what seems like all of his movies -- *make* the movie. I won't give anything away; it simply has to be seen.",Seven Samurai
522,johnstonhenry31,Amazing Film,10,2 January 2018,"I'm not too good at writing reviews, but I do know that this film is amazing. Toshiro Mifune's acting as Kikuchiyo is very well done and his character development was groundbreaking for the time. Akira Kurosawa executes shots perfectly. Not only is the cinematography visually appealing but it also accentuates the already amazing storytelling done by the actors and set.Aside from more technical features of this film, it never ceases to entertain. I have seen this movie several times and the first time I worried it would be hard to sit through because classics tend to be slower over long periods of time. But Kurosawa gets right to the point and every scene has conflict and story.This movie is epic, redeeming, sometimes funny, and tragic at times. It'll hijack your emotions and will never bore you. I cannot emphasize any further how great this film is and how important it is for any cinephile to watch. A definite 10/10; Seven Samurai will go down in history.",Seven Samurai
523,noahmed,Don't Waste Your Time!,1,20 August 2020,"Seven Samurai, is a Japanese Film from 1954. It's a black and white film, and is considered a classic. I don't see this as a classic. I see this as a film that was possibly great in its time, but did not age well. Time has not been kind to this film/ I personally do not feel that the average movie goer, would get pass the first hour. Let's talk about what I liked. First off, the acting is good. Each actor fits their character and thats fine. The Direction is good. That's really it. This film has a lot going against it for today's age. And that is how I am going to conduct this review, from a viewer in today's age. What I didn't like is majority of the film and its aspects. Let's start with the big one, the movie is Three and a Half Hours long. When it does not need to be. The first hour alone could be cut in half and it wouldn't take away from the main story. Which brings me to my next grievance. The plot of the movie doesn't come into play until an hour of the movie. I was sitting waiting for something relevant to the plot to happen and by the first hour when it happens. I have lost all interest in the movie. Another factor is the pacing is awful. The movie is 3 hours and 27 minutes, it felt like 4 hours or more. I was constantly checking how long I had left. One last thing is you really don't know whose who. You have these characters that are thrown into a scene and it's never really explained who they are or what their purpose is. I had such high hopes for this film because I heard it was great. But, I was given nothing but what was a great film in it's prime that lost it's meaning and watchability over time.",Seven Samurai
524,lazarr,Seven Ways This Movie Works,10,11 November 2016,"First of all, this movie gave us an enormous look at Kurosawas talented filmmaking mind he was. When I watched the film I realized there are Seven ways this movie definitely works.01.Multiple Camera Technique This puts us in the mood the atmosphere, and we can see multiple things that are great about this movie (excellent starting in my opinion).02.The Music One thing that took my mind away was the opening music. The song is so simple, yet so heart pounding, Fumio Hayasaka really made a score to remember and gave something new to this film. Sometimes easy, sometimes very difficult to understand, that is the reason why the music is so beautiful and Iconic.03.The Actors The thing about actors is, they with their performances make us believe that they were real people and then again when we realize that they are just actors why still love watching them do things that often seem difficult or deadly, like fighting 40 bandits with peasants, grieving for the fallen, but still fighting until the ending. That is way actors like Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura really stood out in this epic.04.The Plot Now we are getting serious. The fact of the already amazing plot is that it first seems so simple, but at the very end you realize those 3 and a half hours of fighting and Toshiro Mifune goofing around, you see the bigger picture, realizing that this movie has a higher message (which I will let you find out for yourselves).05.The Timeline I am not a history expert, but the fact that this movie is taking place in 1586, during the Sengoku period makes it more difficult to grasp what this movie is about. Samurai being proud and evil with peasants, can gives a shadow of a doubt that there is no hope for them. but when Kambei comes in and rounds up samurai, hope rises and the movie stars to make sense.06.The Prologue and The Epilogue this movie has (at least in my opinion) an interesting prologue and epilogue. The prologue begins with the bandits approaching the village, before sparing the peasants of suffering. The peasants are not happy that they are spared. They instead cry because they now they will come back soon for them. Without hope they ask for help from their oldest and wisest man. He says they need Samurai. Epilogue ends with a victory, almost. Kambei realizes that they are the ones who lost this battle and that the peasants are the ones who won. if that is not something then I will stop writing this review.07.The Fact That It Is So Popular All Around The World Seven Samurai is a film to be admired. All the things I said before, and it has its own popularity, everywhere. Those things make for a Star Wars like experience which needs to be seen at least once in a lifetime.With all this I just listed, I can proudly say that Seven Samurai is the ultimate samurai film, the best film in Japan, and one of the best films in movie history (That is why I gave it 10/10 rating).",Seven Samurai
525,samar_bhattacharya,An excellent movie to see,10,26 August 2005,"I have seen the original Japanese edition with English subtitle. The film is shot on black $ white mode. The story covers up a profile of peasants in Japan in short but detailed cuts. But it also lays out few more profiles not generally common outside Japan, the Samurais.The story starts with a danger of inevitable raids to be conducted by the bandits of mountain on a village what was looted before and the farmers know the terrors already. They come to know the possible fear of attack and decide to hire protectors, here Samurais who fight for earnings, individual business soldiers.They ultimately hire six samurais and one stranger who claim as a samurai but was a farmer's son in origin thus constitutes the group of seven. The leader decides the plan of defense in three corners of the village and opens a side unpatrolled to invite the intruders, in his words that was a shape of good fort with an opening to let attackers in. Soon the battle started among forty bandits and seven samurais leading and guiding rest willing villagers to form phalanx with fighting strategy. They kill bandits by events to reduce the strength to thirteen and the last decisive battle finishes the rest and also four samurais. The peace sets in the village.According to the storyline, the movie shows the agony of hopelessness of the common old villagers and spark of revenge between young ones. The Samurai's war-strategy is detailed by the leader, the exceptional swordsman in the team showing his skill without glamour and always reaches to perfection. The once-farmer's son describes the general hatred of villagers to Samurais, their ladies are kept aside not to be attracted by Samurais and still a unique love story was built with great background humming sound when a young samurai met a village girl whose father tried to shape her as a boy to the eye of samurais but failed. The love found its own way naturally. I am not going to name any of the persons in the film as this should be a mystery to the viewers have not seen yet and who have seen it not a mystery any more. The picturization is unique in terms of the focusing the camera to the actors' faces, every deep expression, whether sad or joy was shot cleanly close to make the audience feel the same. The make-up sometimes was felt to be seen but not at all poor one. The dialogues are short most of the time yet powerful. The battle scenes are taken with great deal of accuracy where bandit archers and horse riders are attacking in ranks and villagers resisting them with courage.In all cases, the long movie gives us: clean story, battle, war strategy, love story, social picture and suspense. Hats off to Kurosawa. Though made in 1954 with less modern equipments and far ahead sharpness which are still absent in today's movies generally.",Seven Samurai

After about an hour into the movie i was drawn into it from watching them recruit the other samurai until the end when 4 of the 7 died. After this I'll never judge a movie by what language it is.

The age of the film, coupled with the fact that it's a daunting 3 1/2 hours made me hesitant to even watch it. But once I set my mind to it, whoa-ho I was in for a treat. I could not believe how good this movie is! At first I was watching it in the background while I did other work. However, after only 20 minutes, I was struck with the intense character development in the film. All other distractions aside, I focused on the film for the remainder of the time and sat mesmerized at the sheer quality and emotion that was captured by the director. I've watched many, many movies over the years, and I quickly lose interest in a film as I suffer through formula and predictability. Not so here. A rare treat.

529,Kraynak,Perfect for the Fourth,10,5 July 2000,"With no forethought whatsoever, I spent my American Independence Day holiday watching ""Seven Samurai"" from beginning to end. I had seen it many times before, but it was only after this particular viewing on this particular day that I realized the many themes of this picture make it such appropriate Fourth of July fare.Beyond the generally obvious, like farmers enlisting allies to fight oppressive bandits, there are the specific [and very Japanese] moral themes that struck me the most. Often, the fighters are pressed to recall those things that make one strong in the face of battle: the good of the community over the good of the individual, you fear the enemy but he fears you also, and the fact that there will be consequences to acting as individuals [in disregard for the common good]. There are other examples, but too many to cite here.We Americans value our independent spirit, but sometimes forget the need to act as community. The American Revolution is a good example of the need for community effort for the common good [and, eventually, the individual good].So, for Independence Days to come, I will shelve Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"" and opt to watch Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" instead.",Seven Samurai
530,Gumbo-3,One of the best films ever made; don't let the subtitles scare you,10,26 September 1998,"If ever there were a film that could make even the most xenophobic American film-goers begin to accept foreign films, ""The Seven Samurai"" is it. Akira Kurosawa's magnum opus (speaking of foreign) is a tour de force of cinematic style, fast-paced and exuberant action, and most importantly, magnificent characters.  This film is not a sanctimonious, solemn foreign picture.  On the contrary, 3-1/2 hours won't feel like enough as you see the seven brave swordsman use cunning, skill, bravery and humor to transform a village of cowardly farmers into a team of spear-wielding warriors. It is a shame that so many American moviegoers fear subtitles and exotic tales of centuries ago, because many of them won't give ""The Seven Samurai"" a chance.  But this film is a must-see not only for film buffs who want to see great writing, acting, cinematography and directing, as well as the archetype for the American western, but also for anyone who loves tales of heroism, love, war, revenge, or just a grand old time at the movies.

532,nholowka,Possibly the greatest film epic of all time.,10,19 July 2000,"An extraordinary story focusing on the lives of poor farmers in feudal Japan. But it also focuses on the lives of ronin, travelling warriors called samurai with no masters, and their struggles for survival and dignity.One of Akira Kurosawa's finest films was directed based on the 'westerns' genre created in the US, but ironicly became an inspiration for almost every western made after it. Its influences can be seen in movies like 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'The Wild Bunch'.Topping a cast in which every role seemed perfectly acted are Takahashi Shimura, playing the wise and crafty leader of the samurai, and the late Toshiro Mifune playing the drunk swordsman who turns out to be the most noble of all.This movie is a glorious and tragic look at the life of the farmer and the mercenary, and even the bandit.Ultimately, this film ranks as one of the greatest ever createdno matter where you place it: Action, Adventure, Drama,",Seven Samurai

534,hussein_jani,the greatest film ever made,10,2 April 2001,"What can I say about the greatest film ever made? Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is a total package of a film. The film has it all; drama, action, comedy (provided by Toshiro Mifune) and alittle romance too. The entire cast is excellent, but the obvious stand out is the brilliant Toshiro Mifune. Mifune, a Kurosawa regular, is great in this film, displaying a wide range of emotions. I'm not ashamed to admit that the ending brings a tear to my eye.In my opinion, Kurosawa was the greatest director (just edging out Stanley Kubrick) ever and I doubt will ever be surpassed.So, if you haven't seen Seven Samurai yet, I hope this review was helpful. Go see this film, and enjoy. Other Kurosawa greats to see: Ran, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, High and Low, Rashomon, The Bad Sleep Well and The Hidden Fortress (just to name a few).",Seven Samurai
535,davidsc-11790,An enlightening but somber film.,7,25 July 2019,"The movie is good and well made, sort of archetypal in its representation. Revealing 3 types of people. The peasant, the samurai and the barbarian. You could say that it is moral in the sense that the good guys win. However I say it's somber because the noble samurai's don't get any goodness other then the ability to be of service, their pleasures are short lived and quick just like their intense battles. Whereas the peasants after victory will surely enjoy a long enduring peace. Another thing apparent in this movie is class, some samurai deny serving peasants and that is the last we see of them. Some although the barbarians get destroyed for their cruelty others simply move to another location. What this movie could be summed up as is gaining good fortune if not the lowest of the low those most down to earth, gain freedom.",Seven Samurai

And though it is long, it justifies its running time completely; every strand of plot, every piece of dialogue, every single shot, is ultimately paid off in the dramatic second half.The ending, perhaps one of the best in all of cinema, is a bittersweet conclusion to a truly epic adventure that should leave no doubts in one's mind that this is indeed a special movie.

538,bobcdawg,A Classic but with too Many Flaws for the Modern Viewer,7,15 February 2020,"This movie is considered one of the greatest movies of all time and was certainly groundbreaking in many ways. However, for this viewer, there were too many flaws or distractions to allow me to rate it higher than a 7.Yes, the story is well told, but the movie is too long. Some scenes drag on longer than necessary to make the point. There is a lot of setup to get to the more entertaining action scenes in the last third of the movie.Some things that particularly bothered me and detracted from the movie for me were the incredibly obvious skull caps that many of the main characters wore. It was close to comical with some actors and that immediately distracted me and weakened the movie for me. Next, while Kirasawa is famous for his attention to detail and cinematography in the battle scenes, there were real weaknesses there. While the villagers had very long spears, they did not seem to use them to maximum effect, when simply ramming the riders with the spears would have been enough in real life to knock them off their horses immediately or kill them outright. They also would have used them against the horses themselves in a real battle. Then, in most cases after riders fell from their horses, even when surrounded they almost always were able to crawl away briefly before being stabbed. Next, despite the great potential for exciting sword fights between the samurais and the bandits, this was almost or entirely nonexistant. The samurais never really got to show their skill, other than single swipes at the riders or simply stabbing the bandits. A complete waste of cinematic excitement!Finally, while presumably the bandits were in it to fight to the death, this is only hinted at and it just seemed idiotic for their forces to get weaker and weaker and yet they continue to attack with no hope for success or even a plan to win. I could not help but focus on how stupid they were and that it was obvious they were going to lose badly. The film tries to build up the drama for the ""climactic"" battle, but it is completely ridiculous.Last, while the bandits have their ""fort"" destroyed by fire, they never think to use fire to defeat the villagers. This, again, makes no sense at all and was so obvious a solution that it was very distracting.Another annoying factor was that the villagers were portrayed as completely pathetic, actually crying hysterically many times in the movie. They came across more as losers than people deserving of sympathy. I just didn't get the purpose of the excessive crying. Also, a few times the screaming of various characters seemed excessive and made them less realistic to me.So, in conclusion, these were significant flaws to me that brought my rating of the film down. I consider it worth watching and overall entertaining, but just not a great film.",Seven Samurai

The exciting action sequences are just so smooth, the way Kurosawa uses movement is so incredible. You're left there stuck to the screen watching all the samurai talk, normal conversations become so interesting. You're given time to learn about each character. The samurai recruitment part is probably my second favorite part of the film, after the final battle. The acting is also incredible. There's almost no exposition but you learn everything there is to the story via images and short conversations.I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND this film if you haven't already watched it, it's a must-watch and it really shows the potential of foreign language films.

Halfway through, I was thinking, gosh, its already half over? while towards the end I was longing for it to go on.  At 3 hours, 20 minutes, its as long as two movies combined, but it wouldn't be possible to cut a single second.  On the way to the car, I had a desire to rent it on my way home and watch it all over again.  My first reaction:  I cannot believe how good that was - why can't all movies be this good?

543,Skull_Thunder,"Not totally overrated, but could benefit from a possible remake",8,7 November 2021,"Shichinin no Samurai, or ""Seven Samurai"" was a slog to get through when I first watched it. I remember thinking that it was really weird to call it just plain ""Seven Samurai"" rather than ""THE Seven Samurai"". I was also quite annoyed that I had made myself watch a 3-hour movie.Now that I'm not bitter anymore, I can probably be a little more charitable to what is widely considered Akira Kurosawa's most influential movies.Seven Samurai falls into a category of movies that I would consider just slightly overrated to a degree. For the time it was made, this movie can just be credited as creating the ""Meet the Team"" trope and nothing else. While I particularly enjoy that idea above certain other ones, I think that in it's current state, this so-called magnum opus of filmmaking leaves 2 major things to be desired.The first is that someone gets off before the climax (not saying who to make this review spoiler-free). It's quite annoying, and I think that part sucked. That's probably just me.The second is that I couldn't tell the main samurai characters apart easily. Seriously. The only way to tell two of them apart was through the ""distinguishing feature"" of one having a bald spot.This could honestly be easily fixed. I think that this movie could benefit from color. Just making each samurai have a different colored robe would really make them stand out just a little more.In all honesty, I think that with just some quick and tiny tweaks to the story, this movie would really benefit from a remake. I say remake, because they wouldn't have to change much. They could still keep it 3 hours long. It benefits from the length. I think that if they sort of remade the action scenes to have a slightly quicker pace, and just sort of indicated the difference between the Samurai, this movie could probably live up to my high nitpicky standard (that was slight sarcasm)
Overall, I'd still call this a masterpiece. It's actually quite good. I could consider this movie to be one that a lot of people should watch once in their lives.",Seven Samurai
544,vadallen,Insredible action with a deep philosophical meaning!,10,12 February 2007,"First time I watched it I was completely immersed in a story. It's got so imprinted in my mind that a second time (a couple of years later) I could keep my mind above the plot to look deeper and discovered for myself a beautiful second sub-level of emotions which really thrilled me. I must say about it because I have read 5 or 6 reviews on this movie: only one of them barely resembled my point, and I refuse to think Mr. Kurosawa did not realize this 2nd level while making the movie. I am talking about its great Humanism which has 2 aspects. #1 - is a war. No other movie made me feel so vividly that killing each other, no matter how great or noble is your cause, is always, ALWAYS, an evil, horrific, dirty, unnatural thing which is going to haunt its participants forever (may be with an exception of, well, samurai, who probably really believed in what they do). Yes, you can kill somebody to save the World, but - in the end there might be nothing to be proud of. #2 - is the purpose of human life. It stunned me that the percentage of people you meet in your life who are - A) selfish B) don't care and C) doing good deeds - is roughly the same as a number of - A) bandits B) peasants and C) samurai heroes - in the movie. What Kambei says in the end about whose victory it is (and knowing what price 7 samurai have paid for it) reaffirms the notion that those of us who are doing good deeds must remember that you should not expect a reward for it, and the only true reward you can get is within yourself. And it still is as elusive as that famous wind which goes through all Kurosawa's action. I am happy now: next time I watch it I will discover something else.",Seven Samurai

Simply put, I have never seen a foreign film that's subtitled that transmits the emotion of the characters as well as ""The Seven Samurai.""  If you are seeing the film for the first time, you need not worry about understanding the plot the first time around, either, as it is transmitted quite easily.Observing the film is still a joy even after many viewings.  You also understand not only how great the film is after viewing it on its own accord, but you also understand how influencial it is as well, as we still see many techniques in the film still used today.IMHO, it's the best non-English language film ever made.

None of this happened to me watching ""the seven Samurais""; all I can say is that this is a very enjoyable adventure and action movie.To young viewers not familiarized with classic movies I would say: don´t fear the black and white photography, don´t fear the length, don´t fear subtitles, this film has nothing to do with what you (maybe) expect from a Japanese 1954 movie.

547,samurai_warrior07,A Masterpiece!!,10,30 July 2007,"When one mentions the name of Kurosawa on the subject of film, which words come to mind when one describes the work of this director? Genius, masterpiece, exceptional, visionary, classic (just to name a few). His most well known film (and which is still also known to this day, as one of the greatest films ever made) Not only for Japanese film, but for the international film spectrum, is Seven Samurai (Shichinin no Samurai).This film is to me, fantastic!! No other epic could ever top this film! As this film is pretty much the one that started the whole epic genre. Copied and inspired numerous remakes, the story feels real and is original in it's own true form. Anyone who is into epic adventure movies, or Japanese cinema and has yet to watch 'Seven Samurai' only one thing I can say is ""What in the world have you been doing!? You must watch this film!!""Do not let the running time of the film discourage you, it is quite a long film but it's worth every minute!! I did not even reallies the running time of the film until it was over and I looked at my watch and thought ""HOLY MONGOLIA!!""A True Masterpiece!! Acting and directing is flawless.

Although they fight with sword, spear, arrow and the movie is in B/W but the realism in so similar and you got to remember that this movie is in the 50's.

554,fearsomez,The film of its time,6,13 July 2009,"""Shichinin no samurai"", also known as ""Seven Samurai"", is a film by Akira Kurosawa released on 19 November 1956. It was a Japanese film about a small village that was having trouble with a group of forty armed bandits. The village hires a samurai to help defend the village. The samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) determines that he will need six other samurai to defend the village. The total of seven samurai trains the village how to defend themselves. They end up using a cunning strategy to cut some of the bandits off from the others to take out several at a time. At the same time there is an underling story of romance. This film is a very interesting film that uses filming techniques and quality far beyond its time. Akira Kurosawa was one of the first to use multiple cameras to get different angles. It has the action needed to catch the viewer with an underling story of love. It shows seven people who got together to help a village in need, which created a bond together that will last a lifetime. The village had a great victory defeating the bandits, but the samurai lost, in that they lose several of their new found friends. For me, this movie is a very inspirational film, which shows how friendship can be formed in even extreme times. It has the quality needed and the length to have a well formed plot that is difficult to see with many of the shorter films that they have now. Many films try to catch the viewer with special effects and attractive people, but this film did not have that option and had to use the plot and amazing filming techniques to attract the viewer.",Seven Samurai
555,amir-635-2743,The greatest film ever made by the greatest director of all time,10,2 November 2015,"This is simply the story of a poor farming village terrorised by bandits who decide to hire Samurai (or Ronin - masterless Samurai) to protect them. However as they are only able to offer food and accommodation, it proves to be very difficult. It sheds a light on all aspects of the Samurai class and how their fighting has affected the lives of farmers and shows the plight of a farmer at the time.Although Kurosawa was himself influenced by some of the grand shots of the Ford Westerns, his Samurai films are unrivalled in their brilliance and to this day no remake or adaptation has come close to Kurosawa's genius and his adaptations of Shakespeare plays make Olivier's ""Hamlet"" look like a student film, and I love the Olivier Shakespeare films. I know this is a bold statement and I certainly don't expect everyone will agree with me.If you haven't seen a Kurosawa film before and are not used to the long epics, I would recommend first watching ""Yojimbo"", which inspired Sergio Leone's ""Fistful of Dollars"", or ""Hidden Fortress"", which George Lucas admits gave him a bit of inspiration for ""Star Wars"".The 3 1/2 hours fly by and causes you to feel almost every emotion possible in what is truly the perfect film. It should be much high on IMDBs top 250, #20 is far too low.NB: If you do end up enjoying Kurosawa films, they can be very very addictive!

When I recommend it to others, I summarize it as being a 3 1/2 hour black & white film in Japanese... that is over far too soon!  It has everything: action, humor, love, nobility, liars, cowards, and characters who are quickly defined but compelling to watch.The toughest thing about the movie is the first fifteen minutes.  When the peasants are wailing and gnashing teeth, it might tempt you to switch to a different channel.  Stick with it...This is not a ""gore for gore's sake"" samurai flick, nor is it one of those deep, introspective artsy flicks.

558,austinbirdman,Candidate for Greatest Movie Ever,10,17 January 2006,"The Seven Samurai is without doubt one of the greatest movies ever made. It has humor (which translates from Japanese, even five decades after the production), outstanding action, depth, realism, great characters, a classic dramatic climax, and one of the most moving sequences in all of film (when the character played by Toshiro Mifune reveals his secret), in addition to many unforgettable scenes.While the movie is deep and philosophically rich, it is also highly accessible. The story is so well told visually that my daughter was complete absorbed in it at age four (she actually woke me up the next morning to watch the final sequence -- ""The Bandits! We have to see what happened to the Bandits!"") and she still asks to see it every few months. The action, bandits, heroes, and love story all caught her fancy -- and imagine what it's like if you can actually read the subtitles. My point is, if a four-year-old can get into it, so can anyone.This film stands as a testament to the true power of cinema. It is one of the masterpieces of film-making and of 20th-century art. Wonderful on first viewing, it becomes better and better each time it is enjoyed. The film simply succeeds on all of its levels -- as the epitome of the action-genre Western (and its Japanese cousin, the Samurai movie), as Shakespearian drama with a blend of high and low art, as epic cinema, as realistic period drama, as an example of Kurosawa's artistry, his camera-work and editing, and as a vehicle for timeless acting from the major stars.It's sad that Americans see so few foreign films (without considering perhaps that most of the world is foreign) -- this one should not be missed.",Seven Samurai

563,xlix-298-152419,How can it be in the top 20??,5,21 February 2012,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS To be honest I found this movie disappointing. I know that it is old and I was not expecting effects or anything like that (naturally) and for the first one hour it was exactly as I pictured it would be. I will admit that the movie is educating about the Japanese culture and lifestyle of the past and it has interesting and charismatic actors but the script has major gaps. The biggest fault and one that simply ruined the whole movie for me and especially the end was the way the villagers felt about the whole attack. Now, military tactics was invented by mankind far far far before the fifties so please don't think that I am being harsh on a '50s movie. The truth is that the scriptwriter and the director for some reason just decided to make everyone look stupid by making it like that. Here is what I mean: The approximately 150 villagers are attacked by 40 or so bandits (I forgot the exact number) on horses and having 3 guns. When they have already killed about three quarters of them and have stolen TWO of the THREE guns for some reason they start to panic and dramatize that they are all going to die the next day when the bandits do their final raid. By that time the villagers had suffered only a few casualties (not more than 10 as I could see) and most of the samurais were still alive. It doesn't take to be a genius warlord to say that this battle is already won. Anyone who had suffered such losses would never make a final attack against more than a hundred men inside a fortified village who have two of the three guns on the battlefield. The way that the villagers acted though was as if they are doomed and this really irritated me. Hence the grade of 5. Apart from that, there were other minimal faults such as at the end where the bandit chief's gun fired two times in a matter of seconds which for that kind of gun is impossible but these are minor issues. The lack of simple logic when considering the battle is the major minus of this movie and ruins the whole experience of what would otherwise be a 7.3-7.4 picture. I cannot see why it is in top 20 and why there are so many amazing reviews of it being ""EPIC"". It is everything else but it is not epic. As a whole, it is a good movie if you want to learn a bit of Japanese history but not if you want to see a good combat movie.",Seven Samurai

Mostly known in Japan as a character actor, often in monster or sci-fi films--in many of Kurosawa's films he is a star.Slight spoilers--Look out for Kurosawa's characteristic use of weather to intensify action, especially high winds and the heavy rain of the final battle. Also, look out for the bandits cresting over the horizon as they descend down the long slope toward the beleaguered village for this final battle. The appearance of enemy hoards over the horizon will become a cliché in many later action pictures; remember Kurosawa did it first.This is the first time I've seen this movie and it has risen to being, for me, the second best film of all time. Only bettered by Welles ""Citizen Kane"". This film was remade in the US as ""The Magnificent Seven"".

568,mikeofw,My All Time Favorite Movie,10,31 August 2004,"I saw this movie as a boy in the seventies when it was aired on PBS television. They aired it as a six part series. Each week I would wait in eager anticipation for next installment. It was for awhile a yearly event for PBS to air the movie. Later I received the double VHS of the movie. I believe I have watched the movie 40 times now. My kids are big fans and it is great activity for us to watch it and best of all discuss it.My favorite scene is when the peasant were in the stable asking the (future) leader of the seven samurai to help them. He at length turns them down. Yohi starts to cry and the low lifes that were a nuscence to them scoffs; ""I'm glad I'm not a farmer"". Which eventually leads to the leader agreeing to help them.I've thought about all the great movies I've seen over the years nd I can honestly say this is my all time favorite.

569,kspit-1,A true masterpiece,10,26 February 2005,"NO Spoilers Below - plot discussion was avoided.Akira Kurosawa is considered one of the finest directors who ever lived, and the Seven Samurai is his epic masterpiece. This is a remarkable claim, and this movie undoubtedly lives up to its reputation. In my opinion, the success of Seven Samurai lays on three main pillars: cinematography, script and acting. Other features such as the score are functional but are in no way the centre of attention.From a cinematographic point-of-view, this movie is flawless - one of those rare gems in film history. The angles are chosen carefully and Kurosawa makes brilliant use of zooming in/out, as well as showing a mastery of the moving camera. Perhaps the greatest achievement is photography - countless set-pieces are memorable, especially during scenes of conversation between the samurai and the peasants. The scenes of the selection of the samurai are another must-see, and must-hear. It's a pity that the movie was shot in black & white, but perhaps colour wasn't good enough yet. When Kurosawa did colour, his films were among the most colourful ever made anyway! (see Kagemusha or Ran).I don't understand Japanese, so I don't have access to the original script. However, if Criterion's translation is correct, then Seven Samurai's script stands out. The dialogue is thoughtful and well-written, unlike most other movies, especially those made recently The dialogue at key moments is what shines most. However, dialogue would be useless if the movie didn't have the right actors to fill in the carefully-created roles. And Seven Samurai surely has: above all Takashi Shimura (Kambei) and Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) - Kurosawa's favourites. Shimura portrays the old, wise and gentle samurai leader flawlessly while Mifune - as usual - steals the show in the scenes he is in. To me, the ""speech"" scene by Mifune is easily one of the most memorable in film history. Mifune, after all, is a true specialist in anger. Lastly, to note is that Japanese actors adopt the ""Noh"" style rather than the ""realistic"" Hollywood style. Actors do not try to be natural and realistic - their main focus is to show emotion through facial expression, body movement and speech - which might seem ""over the top"" for many. The ""Noh"" style of acting resembles more Western theatre rather than Western film-making. The other actors, most of them participating in various other Kurosawa pictures, are also brilliant - there is no acting flaws in this movie...from the facial expressions of the peasants to the valorous movements of Kyuzo.Seven Samurai is a brilliant package of acting, style and cinematography and no-wonder this formula was copied and re-copied by countless other pictures. This movie is a treasure to behold dearly: a masterpiece fully deserving its reputation as one of the greatest pictures ever made.",Seven Samurai
570,bob-orth,This is a great movie?,7,21 October 2005,"Now, I've heard that this is a great movie. However, the sheer not-goodness of the first half is very difficult to ignore. As great as the last half was, it does not justify the slow, slow, slow beginning. Maybe I'm missing something, maybe I just don't get Japanese humour, but as far as I can tell, the first half deserves a 2.Luckily for this film, there's the last half, the truly riveting conflict that seems to highlight the role of all seven samurai, as well as a few of the important peasants.

The director has recreated the world in this little village that has been beset by bandits. Much imitated, still unsurpassed. By critical consensus one of the best movies ever made, THE SEVEN SAMURAI covers so much emotional, historical, and cinematic ground that that it demands to be viewed over and over again. Director Akira Kurosawa re-imagines the epic westerns of John Ford in a Japanese context, yielding an art-house action picture with cross-cultural appeal. I love the authenticity and realism of this movie. It might be a tad long compared to today's standard but there is no wasted scene. I love the characterizations and the stories of each of the seven samurai. The fact that any one can possibly find anything wrong with Seven Samurai is just bewildering. This is a classic example of truly deep cinema that will never be able to be recreated. Simply breathtaking from the performances to the sets, everything is outstanding. Kurosawa was famous for being a perfectionist when it came to his sets and it shines through here. The villages look incredible and everything looks perfect, including the costumes.

I am a fan of Toshiro Mifune. That is one of the reasons I decided to watch this movie. He is one of the best Japanese actors, although my knowledge of Japanese cinema is severely lacking. This movie is up there with The Godfather trilogy, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and many other great movies. One thing to know going in is that this is not an action movie first, this is a drama first, and an action movie when the time for the action is right. Like any good movie, the characters come first. While there are no downsides to this movie that I have noticed, some may be turned off my the length and the lack of knowledge of Japanese culture. This, for the moment, is the longest movie I have seen besides the Extended Lord of the Rings (counting it as one movie as it was filmed that way and written that way. The 3 and a half hour runtime is perfect for this movie. It may feel long but not 200+ minutes long. The drama is engaging, the comedy (mostly from Mifune) is great, and when the action starts it is edge of your seat.

574,l-john206,A masterpiece of cinematic arts,10,26 June 2005,This is my Holy Grail of films. I find this film goes beyond an apparent story line but moves by way of it's subtext to a metaphysical and transcendental awakening in the viewer. The yin and yang of a life and death struggle. The grinding conflicts of man inhumanity to man in a world that is not surreal but in a black and white reality ( the real world). Kurosawa is a man of vision with a profound sense of creativity in cinematic language. The cast is so superb and it's probably the closes that one will get to perfection in an epic ensemble of characters. Toshiro Mifune? A master of revealing inner conflict and pathos. I look at this film as a balm for my spirit to be renewed. It's a film that can only be described as a cosmic force that has a message for the viewer that looks at humanity in it's chaos and societal degeneration and finally it's rebirth.,Seven Samurai

Also scenery and film locations are chosen with care and the wardrobe designers have done a awesome job with everything. Quotes from Akira Kurosawa: With a good script, a good director can produce a masterpiece. With the same script, a mediocre director can produce a passable film. But with a bad script even a good director can't possibly make a good film. For truly cinematic expression, the camera and the microphone must be able to cross both fire and water.

576,pvdmeer,One of the best films I ever saw,10,20 June 2011,"This film is not overrated. It deserves all the praise it can. It's an epic but with -real- people. The characters, even the heroes or peaceful farmers, all have their moments of weakness. Moments where they are vulnerable, despicable or ugly. This is something which I have failed to see in mainstream cinema ever since the 1980's. Somehow, cinema has become a schizophrenic art. Superheroes and super villains on one side and the arty films about weeping losers and the stench of humanity on the other. Wouldn't it be better if we could combine both sides of the story? Who seriously believes a 110% altruistic hero saving the day? Is that a good way to inspire the movie-goers, or is it just offering an escape, nothing more? And who believes narcissistic nobodies ever getting past the stages of teenage angst and actually making their lives interesting enough to put on film? The thing about Seven Samurai is, most of the characters have their weaknesses. But they face them, rise above them and make the world a better place. Of course, that would fit the Star Wars trilogy as well. However, Star Wars chose to replace the background of every day human life with midgets in suits. The same thing goes for the strategy portrayed in the film. It goes beyond the action movie ""hit em where it hurts"" type plan and is actually more complex than the ones portrayed in most war movies.The things that actually inspired Hollywood were the characters of the heroes. Tough but funny at the same time. However, the victims in Hollywood productions never reach this degree of realism. The farmers seem like a peaceful bunch, but actually are so scared and full of prejudice that they'd stab a soldier in the back, given the opportunity.Added to this the fact that where most films of the time were just filmed inside studios and here we had spectacular outdoor battle scenes, makes this film a classic not to be missed. It's just incredibly hard to find a mainstream film with this level of coherence, innovation and eye for detail. I must say that the dramatic acting of the time seems a bit laughable now but that never spoiled things for me.",Seven Samurai
577,twiton,Surpassed my expectations,10,1 December 2015,"When I picked up this film, I went in expecting a moderately appealing samurai film. Instead I got an excellent piece of action, suspense, drama and well-executed cinematography. As a film studies student, this film appeals to me on multiple levels. The story might not be that of Titanic, but it's one that pulled at my heart none the less. The characters are developed through moments that expand on their character in ways that create sympathy and attachment, almost forgotten in modern cinema. This film made me buy a poster simply because it was that good. I enjoyed the setting, the characters, the style, the performance and the direction of the art. If there is one problem I have, it's that the subtitles in the Amazon version are slightly bugged. Apart from that, this film is a great flick for anyone looking for a samurai film.",Seven Samurai
578,miyamachi,Greatest Film Ever *****,10,14 August 2005,A masterpiece. After viewing a documentary on Kurosawa and learning that his older brother walked him through Hiroshima after the bombings and told him to never forget the horror I am surprised he completed as many films as he did with what little sanity he had left. Genius is always clouded with misery and Kurosawa shows this in many of his films. Unfortunately he had to conform to the military's demands in his early years but clearly breaks out with films like this. Anyone who has not heard of this movie should move out from under their rock on mars and check it out. This movie was filmed on a remote part of Japan and took almost three times as long to make as originally planned. Dig it or don't dig at all.GD.,Seven Samurai

Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura are superb in their respective roles of wild one (Mifune) and brave and honourable leader (Shimura). No words can adequately describe the sheer brilliance and completeness of this incredible work of art.

-The presence of the samurai alongside the graves of his friends reminds us of the memory of the struggle or pleasure of the struggle.
-The distance between the samurai and the peasants is the destruction of the memory of myths in the minds of the villagers, and the most beautiful of the unlucky love of the ""Katsushiro"" and ""Shino"" are the defining isolation of these people. ""Kambei"" confesses the bitter truth:

The meticulous development of each of the characters and the charisma of the lead actor were what made this movie not just an action movie but a timeless classic. The director made no concession to time and you are so involved that the extreme length of the movie does not work against it. You are caught helpless in the grip of the story as it moves to its inexorable conclusion. The camera work, the acting, the exotic setting, all combined to make a wonderful cinematic experience. I cannot think of this movie without linking it to his other great and unique classic ""Rashomon"" that tells the story of a rape in 4 different ways.

583,Mikey-45,Masterpiece; an epic film for all time.,10,31 October 1998,"I first saw part of this movie on public television in 1969. The picture quality on tv was marginal, but the film was strikingly different, and so had remained in my thoughts over the years.Two weeks ago, I watched Seven Samurai in its entirety (re-mastered on DVD) along with my wife. I do believe that it is the best film that I have ever seen. The director, Akira Kurosawa, uses the camera in a remarkable way. Individual scenes are beautiful, and memorable, and almost autonomous in their brilliance and quality. Slow motion, used only a few times, is extremely well done. Camera angles, camera movements, and frame-work show the genius of Mr. Kurosawa.The attention to detail on the movie set had me wondering more than once, 'how is it possible to film 16th century Japan when the camera had not yet been invented?'. Of course, the answer is obvious, but it showed to me the power of this movie to totally absorb the audience. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone, especially the DVD version.",Seven Samurai
584,CoolyB,One of the greatest movie classics of our time.,10,10 April 1999,"Being a young filmmaker, I am constantly trying to discover films that can teach me how to push the boundaries of my imagination. I also need to be inspired by the power of the human spirit. Furthermore, because of my struggles in the ""business"" of making film, I need to constantly be reminded of the poetry of making personal films even if they are epic by theme and nature.Seven Samurai provides me with all of the above. A simple but beautiful story that contains some of the most memorable characters and character combinations I've ever seen in film. The characters are so rich that you could devote an entire movie to each of them.I sat in awe as I watched it for the first time on a digitally restored version on DVD.  Criterion did an amazing job in its restoration of the film. If you ever get a chance please watch it on DVD, which contains a section which compares the original and restored versions. They showed a scene, which lasted no longer than a minute where they had to remove 3500 particles! The difference is amazing.When I watch Mifune on screen I think immediately of Kurosawa. When I think of two of them it immediately brings to mind other great collaborations; Fellini and Mastroianni (and Masina); Bergman and Von Sydow; Scorcese and De Niro. It's rare when you have the greatest actor and director working together at their genius peak. It's almost as if the two were one leading their cinematic cavalries on film, and somehow, neither of them could have been as great on their own.I also have to comment on Kurosawa's collaboration with his cinematographer Asakazu Nakai.  Even though the film is about the outcastes of the time, their camera captures the poetic beauty of humanity and nature working together.I went to Japan last year and I am now ashamed that I didn't visit Kurosawa's grave. I am indebted to his contribution to cinema and his influence on my dream.",Seven Samurai

The 7 samurai engineered the war such that they beat the bandits against incredible odds. Never in the history of film has a war been narrated so elaborately, efficiently, lucidly, and with great fun, lots of surprises, and unpredictable through and through. In this war, each killing counts, whereas in many of the wars portrayed in films, you don't feel s*** even when a thousand men is bloody shown to be wiped out by nukes. That's just one little thing making this movie stands out, and God, there are plenty more, so by the name of the Mother, don't miss this movie, and you shall see, Coppla's ""Aprocalpse Now"", and Wolfgan Peterson's ""Das Boot"", even Spieldberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and George Lucas's ""Start War"" all willingly bow before this moive.

I only saw this film for the first time in 2000, almost 50 years after it was made, and was astounded by it. It was an epic that truly told the whole story. Whereas most movies today manage to skirt around huge chunks of what would happen, this movie manages to show them all, and not in a boring way. The samurai don't even reach the village in danger until more than 30 minutes into the film, all that time being spent getting to know each of the characters and the motivation and history behind them. We get to truly learn what it takes to be a samurai, and what truly sets them apart. By the time we arrive at the village we have become attached to some of the samurai in a very personal way, respecting each of them in their own way. The rest of the movie progresses as if it were a documentary, not a fictional film, where we see each and every piece of the grand puzzle that happens in this village. I can't recommend this film enough, though I must throw a disclaimer out that if you're not a fan of epic movies with subtitles you may not be as interested. It is a 3 1/2 hour long movie!

It's not because the music is good or because the storyline is interesting (they aren't), but Kurosawa succeeded in making a movie which has proved to be a great omen of things to come. It combines action and humor in a way which is now frequently done, without losing the audience's attention. Also, this movie is in many ways more related to western movies than it's related to pictures filmed in the east. Whereas most other movies made at the same time in japan contain a moral, this one is obviously fixated on bringing an entertaining action movie without the irrelevant social messages. It's no coincidence this movie was remade, as it's concept (the good minority which ""defeats"" the bad majority) is the basic idea for almost all current action movies.

It has spawned countless imitators and homages. His uses of both style and substance gives you a ""movie you can eat"". Though not his favourite film it is one of his most successful and certainly his most well known.Seven Samurai has so many of what have now become clichéd movie techniques, it's hard to believe that this one movie is almost the first to use them. Slo-motion, the use of the horizon line, cutting on movement and even pointing the camera at the sun. His use of the tele-photo lens along with two other cameras simultaneously has become famous, along with filming the shots cutting 180 degrees. These techniques have been emulated by many directors most notably Steven Spielberg and George Lucas just to name a few.The story itself is also compelling. Told from the point of view of the samurai, we first see the villagers a lowly creatures. Kikuchiyo, played masterfully by the brilliant Toshiro Mifune, Is the go-between that shows us that all is not as it seems. Co-written by Kurasawa the story is the ""lets join together for a common goal"" piece. It does not however do this ham-handed. Once you have an understanding of the Japanese culture you can truly see the richness of all the characters that are involved in the film.Even at over three hours long it still moves like the wind, yet lets you catch your breath at all the right moments.

There is some character development in the first half, but it's not critical to the second half. Some of the story line was just unbelievable -- any young man in his early 20's certainly knows the difference between a boy and a girl, and the girl wasn't trying that hard to look like a boy. This movie was in black and white, as so many of the 'classic' samurai movies are.

Removing a half an hour would not hurt the movie.The infallibility of the head samurai distracted from the sense of suspense as the outcome was never in doubt. Fortunately for the villagers, the bandits never thought of using fire to attack the wooden village.As the bandits' point of view was never presented, it was difficult to understanding why they continued their attack despite their rapidly diminishing numbers. When they were only down to a handful left, it would have been interesting to hear why they wanted to continue their death ride.The sub-titles and black and white photography are only slightly distracting.

It is a magnificent and immensely involving film with many powerful action scenes and seven three-dimensional characters in a compelling story of honor and sacrifice.A rural village in feudal Japan decides to fight back against the bandits who have been raiding them by hiring samurai from a nearby town. One of the many remarkable things about Akira Kurosawa's astonishing historical epic is the fact that at nearly 3 and a half hours it never drags for a single second of it's length. Not one bit. That fact alone is testament to Kurosawa's incredible skill as both writer and director. The balance of artful visuals and narrative is perfect and every character is fascinating and perfectly played, especially Toshiro Mifune's gleeful and almost feral glory hound and Takashi Shimura's good hearted but wily Ronin.

Full of wonderful characters, spectacular scenery, and great performances all around, it is Kurosawa's fantastic story about a poor farming village in 16th century Japan being consistently placed under attack by marauding bandits. Facing starvation if the bandits raid them again, the peasants fearfully and reluctantly turn to seven unemployed samurai to defend themselves.There is no weak element to Seven Samurai. One of its greatest aspects is its characters. Every single one of them, farmer or samurai, is given tremendous development, making them memorable. This is one of those films where if a character gets killed off, you suddenly find yourselves missing their presence on film because you got to know them so well. I will not name him, but there was one ill-fated character in the film when, after he died, I felt kind of cheerless because I had come to respect him as a human being instead of an actor performing in front of a camera and reading out scripted dialogue. If you were to ask me which character was my favorite, I would be tied between two of them. The characters played by Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, two of the finest Japanese actors who ever lived.Another thing I admire in Seven Samurai is the feeling of authenticity. The feeling that it all could have really happened. There are very few moments where the unbelievable occurs, as most action movies tend to succumb to. One thing I admired was the antagonists of the film: the bandits. Unlike most Hollywood movies where the bad guys have names and are introduced as characters to make them effective, the bandits in Seven Samurai all go without names. We only know them as ""the bandits"" and that is appropriate because that's all the characters know them as. Just marauding, murdering bandits who must be killed off as soon as possible.Kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time and that is clear in this film. Many of the transitions and techniques that motion pictures today seem to follow on a conventional level were inspired by this film: slow-motion, a ""fade"" wipe between scenes like what you see in the Star Wars movies, using the weather to affect emotion and atmosphere, a team forming to take on a larger enemy, the list goes on. The movie was so influential that it was remade here in the United States as The Magnificent Seven (1960), which I consider one of the greatest remakes ever. Not as good as its original sourcenot by a long shotbut considerably effective and noteworthy.In regards to the movie's soundtrack, it's a success. The music was composed by Fumio Hayasaka and it's wonderful. We seldom hear any of it, when we do, its an efficacious presence of impact. The opening score is very effective and the music that plays when the farmers are searching for samurai in the town remains one of my favorite soundtrack pieces today.There is one thing in the film that might warn off some viewers. It is long. At over three and a half hours in length, some people will be cautious before sitting down to view it and some will lose their patience, but to those who can sit down and enjoy a movie no matter how long it lasts, it will be realized as fast-moving storytelling. Like The Ten Commandments (1956), even the long takes and the slow pacing seems fast because it is so well-written and so masterfully directed by Kurosawa.One of the greatest masterpieces of all time.",Seven Samurai
629,PineyWoodsSlim,"A Classic, Just Not Perfect",8,6 May 2002,"A very enjoyable film, and as you probably know, the basis for The Magnificent Seven.  The film is well-done and addresses class issues as well as the idea of justice.  My only complaints (and the only reasons I did not give it a 9), and they are small, are that the characters' motivations were not explored as much as I would have liked and the strategy of the Seven for defending the village should have been more in depth because strategy is an aspect dwelt upon early in the film in several other instances.  Still, give this film its due:  it set the stage for many following (and sadly, lesser) American Westerns as well as Japanese films.  I own it, but if you are not a ""film buff"" I suggest renting it and then deciding if you should own it. It is long and unless you're really into the film it will seem to move somewhat slowly.",Seven Samurai

This film is what every movie should be it defines great film making. This includes but is not limited by: amazing character development, superb plot, luscious scenery and most of all it has a point. Kurosawa in my very limited opinion is the greatest of all directors, what Kurosawa was able to do was translate a very basic story into life and death (the fundamentals) he would then proceed to ask the viewer to question themselves, there is no greater director.But and this is a big but, it seems we have learnt nothing, Kurosawa and his peers treated the whole film media as an art form (as it should be), but now we are generally reduced to a low form of nonsense that can only be called tripe, occasional exceptions. I'm genuinely saddened by what has become of the world of the film. It could have been a great force for good, but now just nonsense.rant over",Seven Samurai

632,echoplxx,Kurosawa's Pioneer style,10,9 April 2008,The Seven Samurais is indeed one of the greatest movies ever made. Kurosawa has done brilliant work especially with the perfection in fight sequences which every director today wants to achieve but does not even get close to him. Further I would like to comment on the style that Kurosawa adopts while he plans out and details each character in his film. Every character has his/her style and depth that they are able to pull out in the movie which I don't think every director can demand and attain from his/her cast. A lot of symbolism is used in the film which not only limits itself to the characters in that time or space but each one of those characters who are related to that particular situation or scene. I believe a lot of movies draw inspiration from Kurosawa's style of film making and the future movies will continue to do so.,Seven Samurai
633,Pattman,Fantastic. Undeniably fantastic.,10,26 October 2002,"Slow to start, black and white, subtitled. Some may see these as faults, but I have a different opinion. Kurosawa takes his time to set an utterly fantastic scene in a Japan torn by bandits. The villagers cannot defend themselves, nor afford to pay for mercenaries. And yet they take a chance and go in search of aid.The peaceful silences enhance the somber atmosphere at times while also showing the deep thoughfulness of each Samurai that lends a hand to the cause. The lack of colour only increases that atmosphere. At no point is there much celebration and so the black and white further adds to the morbidity of it. You may think that this makes it depressing, on the other hand, while certainly not a joyful film, there is still a sense of success despite all that goes on.Gripping; masterful; emotional, what more needs to be said.In my view, one of the 5 greatest films ever.Purely fantastic.",Seven Samurai

From start to finish, I grabs your attention and interest and never lets up. The film is near 3 1/2 hours long, yet once it was finished it seemed as if no time had passed at all.

The grainy look that now turns some people off to older movies really works in this film as it adds to the feeling of desperation and despair. The action too, is so well done for its day. I know it exists in a dubbed form, but why bother? Most the time you are reading something, what is happening on camera are characters faces, thing that you need only glance at, and at the times of actions, you can follow it with great care.

I wasn't looking forward to it, I don't care for action movies, or Japanese movies, and the playtime of 200+ minutes.... Let's just say I put of watching this movie for a long, long time.. But then, with nothing else to do or to watch, it was time. And I won't lie to you, I have struggled through it. It was long, it was slow, it took me a while before I got what the story was about and some of the scenes didn't make sense to me. Still, I watched the full movie and I'm pretty sure I'm better for it. The best movies take effort to watch, and this one took a lot of effort. But I learned something from it, the story ended up grabbing me, not right away, but at the end. Some of the scenes were amazingly complex, at times it looked and felt like total chaos for minutes! It's a rich movie, with many stories to tell, I've never seen anything like it, that's probably one of the reasons why it was so hard to watch, but I understand now why it's in the top 250.

It's simply one of the greatest movies in the history of cinema. Akira Kurosawa ingeniously weaves a narrative around the relationship between modest peasants and a group of samurai who are hired to protect the peasants' village from bandits. The way that this relationship develops throughout the film is one of the most compelling and beautiful things I've ever seen play out on screen.

There aren't real samourai fight scenes in it, the bandits almost never appear in the movie and when they do appear they are so stupid they make the same mistake each attack...I think the magnificent seven is a better movie.

650,d-thatcher,Courage Versus Corruption,10,24 April 2004,"I am just commenting on my insights. The director of this movie Akira Kurosawa, and this movie in particular, influenced George Lucas to create the Star Wars movies. It has also been the basis for The Magnificent Seven, Return of the Magnificent Seven, Guns of the Magnificent Seven, The Magnificent Seven television series, Battle Beyond the Stars, A Bug's Life, The 13th Warrior, Shane, Pale Rider, High Noon, The Road Warrior, Galaxy Quest, Woman in the Dunes, Yojimbo, and many others. It is a movie of courage and the power of temptation. It is not so much about the samurai coming to the aid of a community as it is of human nature within a small group of law men. In reality, it can serve as an example to military and officers of the law, that they can be corrupted, but that if they can stand above reproach, the rewards are the in the means themselves.",Seven Samurai

I could watch this movie everyday and never get sick of it, which is a credit to the film direction. I use this film to judge a persons character, in friendship and even relationships.

654,jamiesnas121,A colourful masterpiece in black and White,10,1 September 2013,"I've been meaning to watch this film for some time now but have put it off, mostly due to its length, it being in black and white and it also being subtitled and as someone who is just starting to get into more world cinema, especially from the East, this seemed like a bad place to continue right now. In fact, I thought this film was going to be tedious to watch. So, when I put it In my DVD player (or PS2, take your pick) at half ten last night, I decided to finally sit down and watch Akira Kurosawa's ""masterpiece"" knowing that it won't be finished until half 1 in the morning. When the last scene finished, one word was left in my head, Perfect. This film is nothing short of perfection. And it wasn't the action that impressed me the most; it was the character interactions in the scenes leading up to the climax. Each Samurai (I won't name them as my spelling and memory of the names is anything short of terrible) has a fair amount of screen time, story and overall character.It became easy to distinguish one character from the next as their behaviour was so unique. Three samurai's stood out to me through. One was the young rookie who fell in love with the daughter of a farmer. I felt that this was the Samurai we were meant to relate to. In fact, out of all 7, I would say he is the most different; his skills aren't as well polished as the others. The Second is the Samurai who commands the Village the most, looking like both a leader and a father figure to the young Samurai. The Last was the Samurai who seemed like the heart of the small army. He was not only funny but also had some emotional depth to him. In fact, I will say when he leaves his post and dresses up as a Bandit, that it when we see the biggest development in his character as he see witnesses the effect of his actions. The story was very simple, a Village are being attacked by Bandits and they need the help of Samurai. All they can afford to pay this with is three meals every day. It's the way it's handled however which makes the film stand out among the crowd. It would be rather easy to make this an action orientated film. But it's split into three episodes. They are; 1. The Gathering of Samurais 2. The Preparation for the Attack 3. The Attack Each episode plays out slowly, giving us time to see some character development while the story progresses. In fact, my favourite of all three episodes has to be the first. It was a joy to see who they will get to aid them in their battle. While watching this part, I felt I was there and seeing these other Samurais where like meeting up with old friends. The atmosphere in these scenes feels very authentic. While most films will condense the first two acts so they become an hour altogether, this film spreads them out to build tension for the third act. In fact, the film feels like a journey. We are seeing these characters improve their relationships with each other over the course of the film so that the final episode will be as emotional and as action packed as we should expect. I could go into even greater lengths in saying how good this film is, but I will just be repeating what others have said. In fact, to talk about the whole film would fill books and I just don't have the time to do so. However, something I do feel the need to talk about is the Music, which is actually pretty epic and something I feel gets overlooked. The best part is when the farmer learns about his Daughter and the young Samurai, the music that plays and that moment just fits in way too perfectly. It gets the emotion just right and makes the event stand out the most throughout the film. Without it, that one moment would have just passed away without a glimmer, but with that one soundtrack, all the tension building around that one sub plot had reached a glorious climax.Now, spoiler alert if you have not seen this, but I found the ending to be rather depressing. It stated that even through the Villager's had won the battle, the Samurais hadn't. This is a rather sad moment in the film as it told us that the Samurais had become friends. Now that four of them are dead, it's like their friendship has split. This was hinted earlier in the film when three of the Samurai go and attack the house, one of the Samurai says ""if we lose one, we lose the battle"" (or it was something along those lines) which gave further evidence the seven had indeed lost.Overall, the film was one of the best I've ever seen. Definitely it my top 20. While I can't recommend this to everyone (if you rate Transformers as your favourite trilogy of all time, then I would say stay away from this) I would say give it a try. Besides, it's easy to see that it had a huge influence on Star War, even the wiping transitions are in here. Easily a 10/10.",Seven Samurai

I have tried to find some meaning in even the most awful ones, as I do not think anybody started out to make a bad movie. Sometimes, however, you find the jewel of a life time- and this movie does that for me.I won't give away plot or really even discuss story at all. No, what I want to confess is that my life was enriched by a dead Japanese actor named Takashi Shimura. And, I don't even know much about him, except that, when I was down, in total dispair and about to panic, I saw this movie for the first time. And, I took the character of Kanbei to heart.That may sound strange to some. I will say that at the time, I had sold the home my parents had willed me, moved to a strange state, and was tryng to build a new future. I had four small children and a wife that I adored, and never wanted to let down. I had anxiety attacks for the first time in my life! I could not sleep, could not relax, and I just knew that I had destroyed my life and my family's.I needed to be a leader, and I just could not get my head out of my own misery! This movie showed me a great leader, a living example of Budo. And that was important at that time. I know, Kanbei is an invention of Kurosawa. But, when you create a character and put him out there, he becomes so much more! And that is what art is about, to me- to share a vision, a concept.In short, it is a classic, and for me, personal. I can laugh now, with all those troubles behind me, but I still remember how Kanbei, leading his little band, overcame might for right. May we all!",Seven Samurai

For too long we have been plagued by Hollywoods overdramatised nonsense high budgeted action flicks, and its a shame to have to go all the way back to the 1950's to experience the greatest work within this genre. Seven Samurai is a timeless classic. Very few action films withstand this test of time, becoming corny looking after the special effects or visual style becomes out-dated. You have to remember though as you watch it, that everything was done for the first time. Allot of the great Hollywood films, stole directly content from Kurosawas films. With the greatest western directors like Spielberg, Lucas, Scorcesee, and Coppola all confessing that Kurosawa had been the stronger influence in most work they had created. However that is not to say that Kurosawas influences were not solely of Eastern origin. John Ford, Sergei Eisenstein and Frank Capra had all been deeply influential to Kurosawa, and Kurosawa was, in his time criticized for employing a very Western style in his works.All that aside though, this is a marvelous film, and a must see for any true fan of the action genre.",Seven Samurai

I don't think there will ever be anyone who can come close to Kurosawa's level of directing, period. The casting is superb, each performance is absolutely sublime. This is a movie that you want to last and last, you don't even realize the time going by. The musical score was fantastic as well. There is not a moment of wasted film in this movie. I've watched it many times an I never get tired of it. It was not until I saw a documentary on Kurosawa that I realized the research and effort it took to make this film and the attention to even the most minute detail. I don't see many movies any longer; the stuff the Hollywood machine is churning out is utter crap. I don't think they have a single clue as to what people really want to see. It would serve them well to watch this movie, although it could never, ever be replicated, they could learn a lesson in how to make a ""perfect"" film. Toshiro, you're still my HERO!",Seven Samurai
659,verdant4ce,"A gentle, funny movie",10,16 October 2005,"The Seven Samurai has lived up to the hype. The anime fans and the Internet recommended it. Andrei Tarkovsky recommended it, the great movie poet that he is. The Barenaked Ladies even recommend in a song. And now I recommend it. Director Akira Kurosawa was well ahead of his time, even well ahead of our time. This 1954 epic has influenced countless Westerns, war movies, gang movies, and Hobbit movies, but it still hasn't been surpassed.The plot is straightforward. Roving bandits attack a Japanese farming village, so the villagers hire some roving warriors (samurai) to defend them. The samurai are noble and colourful creatures, who work for food and no money. We see the villager and samurai worlds collide as they prepare for the bandits' attack. Three hours later, there is a majestic battle. Some characters live and some die; it is all part of being a samurai.To call the film an epic fails to do it justice: The Seven Samurai is too gentle to be an epic. Although it can be intense at times, the overall tone of the movie is light and friendly. Ultimately, this movie is a small-scale story. Seven title samurai, forty bandits, and a hundred villagers make up the whole cast, and the characters' actions and influences are confined to the one village. In some ways this is as important as the Battle for Middle Earth or the Battle for Europe, but in other ways it is more harmless, more human. This the Battle for Some Fields and Horses. The simplicity makes it easier for audiences to identify with the characters, and for Kurosawa to explore them.The film is humorous for an action movie. It does not have the flashy one-liners of a James Bond movie, but it has the sort of light moments that are used in Reader's Digest magazines. An important secret is blown in a minute as people keep walking into the room. A crazy man poses in the enemy's uniform and steals guns. An old lady ""avenges"" her son's death by hitting a prisoner with a rake. These moments of strange humour catch us off our guard, much the same as the ""comic relief"" in Shakespeare's plays. There is a time-out from worrying and everyone gets to be playful and human for a minute.Of course, the opposite of humour is the ""visual poetry"", the delicate images in which our story is told. Like humour scenes, breath-taking shots can change the pace of the movie, although they deliver a very different catharsis, an opportunity for peaceful reflection. Kurosawa went to painting school, after all, and it shows here. Here we see horses fall in the mud. Here we see a man's face peering through some leaves. Here two friends chat in the light of a camp-fire. Here the view from a hilltop reminds us how small the village is. The actors are well-chosen for their expressive faces. Jarring fast-motion battle scenes exist in the Seven Samurai, but so do languid Japanese glimpses of nature. This movie runs the visual gauntlet without ever losing its flow.The movie follows a different structure from most action flicks: for the first two hours, we do not see the bandits. The samurai spend a long time planning for the enemy's arrival, and the battle itself lasts just a few harsh moments. This is a more accurate and interesting sort of war story than we usually see.The movie has an abundance of re-watching potential; I feel that there were many patterns and moments and silences that I missed the first time around. I felt like every line two or three meanings, and I was often tempted to rewind a scene and watch it more closely.The Seven Samurai deserves its place in movie history. I can now understand the endless praise it receives from great directors and cool people alike. Although the film was made fifty years ago and it used only black and white, it is still an experience to watch. Akira Kurosawa has told this story so richly that it continues to be the benchmark for films today.",Seven Samurai

There would be full minute breaks in between dialogue where two characters would just be gazing at each other wistfully, with the camera panning back and forth between them.OK, OK.. I get it. It's an important moment. Can we move along now? Don't get me wrong; I tend to be one of the few people in my generation of viewers who can actually appreciate the nuances of a slow-paced movie. I can appreciate a good movie even when it's in black and white and set in one room, like with 12 Angry Men. There's nothing wrong with creating a character slowly, and building up the tension to the climax.. but this movie was something else.

The movie depicts a very realistic and, at the same time, heroic story: villagers devastated by a group of bandits employ the services of seven samurai to defend their village. One should be familiar with the basics of the casts in 16th century Japan, as well as the codes of the military class (Bushido) to have an in-depth understanding of this movie. However, even without the least knowledge of these issues, one enjoys this movie. The Story is perfect, acting superb (Takashi Shimura as Kambei Shimada and Toshiro Mifune as Kikochio, in particular) and cinematography first-class. I give it a 10/10.",Seven Samurai
662,jsutherland,Responding to the pretext that this is the best film ever made,9,20 May 2005,"A return to Seven Samurai helped to confirm that this is one of the best films ever made. Modern films in this genre sparkle because of choreographed brilliance, but this plot/script shows structure and brilliance that don't depend on cinematography or special effects but on a a great screenplay, great character development and phenomenal direction. You forgive the stylisation and stiltedness of some of the performances because you recognise that this is an attempt at reproducing folklore in black and white in a culture which is unfamiliar and untainted by the dominant American/Western culture. While this film was made more than 50 years ago and shows a 17th century Japanese culture it still carried relevant messages for today regarding the futility of war/violence as a solution; the role of women in society and the divisiveness of arbitrarily determined class structures.",Seven Samurai
663,ryuji_009,The canon by which all other films should be measured,10,23 October 2004,"Shichinin no Samurai, or Seven samurai as it is called here, was one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Akira Kurosawa's masterful direction, combined with the impeccable skill of the actors, brings forth a movie that is so much more than a movie. In essence Shichinin no Samurai is a look at the human condition. The differences in people's perception in a class based society are brought out. As well as a sliver of understanding of poverty. Perhaps the best thing about the film though, is that if brings about nearly every emotion in the scope of human feelings. You have hate, anger, love, joy, sorrow, and so many more. As the epic story unfolds, your heart can not help but be swayed by the situation of the farmers, and yet you understand the feelings of honor that the noble Samurai hold. In the end though who can help but have some renewed sense of honor, justice, and duty in their own hearts towards all of humanity? Perhaps I'm speaking too much from the idealic side. The movie also had some very good fights. The action never felt gratuitous, something most films these days don't understand, and was well spaced throughout. I highly recommend this film to anyone. Tell your friends it's 3 hours long, tell them it's in black and white, tell them it's in Japanese with subtitles, and then tell them it's the best f'ing movie ever!",Seven Samurai

Magnificent screenplay, very glamorous problems solved ""without sword"" and outstanding ideas make this film unforgettable for the next months. It's a perfect difference between today's, Hollywood-like movies made by ""clicking the mouse buttons"" in unbelievable short time. It's really worth seeing and remembering.

I pity that the Indian cinema even after those 50 years couldn't make at least one movie like them. This is not to say that there were not many good ones. Let's hope that some new directors with thinking brains and talent would come up with even better movies. Critics should sit down and think why only some movies (even those we find in the IMDb top list) last long to enthuse the audience. All those who love art know very well why is it so.The seven samurai could very well tell me the state and convictions of the Japanese folks. The same is true for all populations and no society is free from such problems. In my simple mind a film maker is successful if he can tell a good story with lot of conviction and in between poses many questions before the audience.

His work is unparalleled for he infused so much finesse and craftsmanship in his films that they inspire me every time I watch them.Very few directors can match his ability and is still counted among legends such as Ozu, Hitchcock, Fellini, Antonioni, Ford, Welles etc.He will always be an inspiration for aspiring directors who want to make quality cinema and not the trash-can, garbage films of today.",Seven Samurai

""Seven Samurai"" is simply one of the greatest films ever made and one I've always been impressed and fascinated by. Toshiro Mifune gets star billing, and deservedly so as he turns in a powerhouse performance, but Takashi Shimura's character is the focal point of the film. I recommend his star turn in Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" as well - a very different story. What makes ""Seven Samurai"" so special is how each character is so completely written and portrayed. Hundreds of others have written much more eloquently about this film so I won't get into details about why I loved it ... except to say that my other favourite character is the farmer, Yohei, a stock ""sad sack"" type who turns out to be so much more.",Seven Samurai

It seems that Asian audiences used to be much more used to long flicks than the Western.The pace in The Seven Samurai is, too, definitely slower than we're used to now in this frenetic Matrix-esquire ere, but the film surprisingly maintains the interest all throughout. Japanese people are quite different to Westerners and for us it's a bit hard at the beginning to get used to reading their expressions and understanding their behaviours and reactions, but once you've managed to do it (the film gives you plenty of time for this) you start enjoying the fantastic depth of the characters and the situations.One thing I'd like to comment about is how subtly sensual the ""love sequences"" between the young samurai and the peasant's daughter are. The scene when they're alone in the wood and he fails to ""make a move"" is really erotic, although in an extremely non-explicit way.",Seven Samurai

They really got into it, the story about how they come together and what they wanted from the job, and the politics, and deception, they movie had a lot to offer.The fight scenes are nothing to today audience but they still offer danger and a more realistic approach to a fight.

677,ViswanathI,Seven Samurai,10,9 November 2015,"Kurosawa was considered the most Western of great Japanese directors (too Western, some of his Japanese critics sniffed). ""Seven Samurai"" represents a great divide in his work; most of his earlier films, Jeck observes, subscribe to the Japanese virtues of teamwork, fitting in, going along, conforming. All his later films are about misfits, nonconformists and rebels. The turning point can be seen in his greatest film, ""Ikiru"" (1952), in which a bureaucrat spends his days in the rote performance of meaningless duties but decides when he is dying to break loose and achieve at least one meaningful thing.There is also an instinctive feeling for composition. Kurosawa constantly uses deep focus to follow simultaneous actions in the foreground, middle and background. Often he delineates the distance with barriers. Consider a shot where the samurai, in the foreground, peer out through the slats of a building and across an empty ground to the sight of the bandits, peering in through the slats of a barrier erected against them. Kurosawa's moving camera often avoids cuts in order to make comparisons, as when he will begin on dialogue in a closeup, sweep through a room or a clearing, and end on a closeup of another character who is the point of the dialogue.",Seven Samurai
678,tsmith04,"Akira Kurosawa's 'ballad of war'; a beautiful story with amazing acting performances, and an even better directorial effort.",10,17 June 2005,"Seven Samurai tells the story of seven unemployed, 16th century samurai who are hired by a poor village under attack from a group of bandits. An uncomplicated story indeed, Kurosawa directs his cast beautifully, mixing the individual abilities of his actors and the simplicity of his plot, and ends up with a work of artistic cinema considered by most critics to be among the greatest films ever made, and even by reviewers of the American film industry.This nearly 3 ½hour masterpiece is more an anthology of scenes of captivation. The epic battle scenes at the end of the film are climaxed by the bandits' final surge into the small, countryside village that is the centerpiece of the movie. The samurai of whom the leadership role is given, Yohei, stands directly in the center of the town 'square' and grandly lets arrow after arrow soar from his bow towards his sworn enemies, all the while dealing with the immense 'buckets' of rain that seemed to be falling from the sky.It seems to be that Samurai could very well be a ballad of waran illustrative dance. Kikuchiyo, played by the famed Japanese actor Toshirô Mifune, exemplifies this brilliantly through the antics in which he displays throughout the film. You nearly feel as if you're watching a 'ballet of war' when he dances around, boldly and bravely charging enemy bandits throughout the film. And he does provide for occasional comic reliefsomething you probably wouldn't expect in an older piece.Kurosawa has directed many award-winning films in the Japanese film circuit, and is considered among the best of the best of all the worlds' directors, but with Seven Samurai, he truly delivers the tour de force of his career, a piece worth its weight in gold, and a film that still awes us decades after its release.",Seven Samurai

While still preparing for my stay in Japan, I watched as many Japanese movies in my home town as possible: Jigokumon, Rashômon, Kakushitoride-no san'akunin, Ugetsu-monogatari etc. When I went to see Shichinin-no samurai, I was overwhelmed by the depth of the epic. The quiet resignation of the down-on-their-luck older samurai, or rather, rônin, the eagerness of the young samurai Kikuchiyo wanting to prove himself, the desperation and fears and inital greediness of the peasants, all intervowen to an unsurpassed saga of an insignificant sideshow of the Warring States (sengokujidai). If you haven't seen the Seven Samurai, you can't possibly know what real jidaigeki is.(Spoiler?:) The lines that most resonated are the words of the leader of the samurai to the young one when he is accepted into the group: ""I know, I know what you are going to say; I once was of the same age as you: hone your skills, go to battle, earn fame for your prowess, become the ruler of a state in a castle... but, while you are thinking that way... look here, your hair turns white like mine... but then, your parents, your family, your relatives are long gone..""",Seven Samurai

Emotions are radiant in body language, facial expressions and speech. While this might bother any fan of realism, the very same fan would, if able to see past this discover a film filled with moments that feel very genuine.My example of this would be the duel between the old wise one and a younger prideful man. The frustration and fear within the young one is heard in his voice and shown in his body language. The tension is held high and explosive movement betray desperation. I felt as trapped as the prideful one watching it. I want to compare it to other sword fights I've seen I remember three at the moment. Namely the debt duel in Barry Lydon, The one by the four legged house in The Duellists and The ending fencing of The Count of Monte Cristo. Right of the bat I don't prefer the camera work in Count and Lydon where one is closer and one is further away utilizing cuts to be able to show what happens. In Samurai not in clear contrast the camera is off at the side while still with sometimes only the one of them in view. but at the time it's not important. The real battle was fought inside the mind of the prideful warrior and after it was lost followed only our lesson. So it wasn't a grasp for air thrill as the Duellists one with sword waving, but it was more dramatic, it had more doom in it.The movie drew me in and kept me immersed the whole time.

Don't think so.,6,15 September 2005,"In my quest to see all of the top movies on IMDb, I watched The Seven Samuri, and I have to admit that it's hard for me to understand the hype. Granted, the movie is over 50 years old. Whenever I watch an old film, I try to put myself in the seat of someone at the time the film was made. The special effects and other things we've become used to when watching modern films were just not available at the time the film was made. I can understand that. In understanding when the movie was made, I found many of the scenes wonderfully done. Unfortunately, the film has MAJOR flaws. First, at 3.5 hours, the film is incredibly long. I don't mind long films, but a long film has to keep the viewer engaged the entire time, and this movie fails to do that. I had to take short breaks just to get through it. Some of the ""amazing"" acting seems like overacting to me. Who acts like that in real life? And worst of all, the story (and here's a bit of a *******SPOILER*******) isn't entirely realistic. How stupid are the bandits that keep coming back for more. They could get the job done when there were 40 of them. What made them think they could get the job done when they were reduced to 13? Now, how realistic is that? *******END OF SPOILER***** This film, while possibly great in it's own time, should be watched now with moderate expectations to avoid disappointment.

If you've seen more Kurosawa, you'll know that this is undoubtedly Kurosawa's best.And if you don't agree, then my guess is that your favourite movie is Plan 9 from outer space, and you should know what that means. This movie should always be in the top 10 films of all time, or, if not, at least in the top 30. As for those of you who haven't seen it, you should, it's well worth the three and a half hours that it takes up, as it will, almost undoubtedly, be in your memory for the rest of your life.",Seven Samurai
690,jeffreynchurch,Just an Excellent Movie,10,15 November 2006,"This movie was seen by my wife and I 2 weeks ago and I still can't stop thinking about it. It had so much to say to me .. The writing was phenomenal and the action was in a class by itself. I will always hold this movie up as my favorite movie of all time. The actors in the film were first rate. The ""wanna be"" samurai ( Toshiro Mifune ) was hilarious and underestimated. Aside from the expert swordsman, he caused the most damage to the enemy bandits. It is good to see that this film has been critically acclaimed to be a masterpiece and ranking in the Top 10 of the IMDb speaks volumes about the users of this website!",Seven Samurai

692,stabers,The Pinnacle of Filmmaking,10,13 February 2018,"There's not much I can say about Seven Samurai that hasn't already been said.It's arguably the most well conceived and well executed film in the history of filmmaking (in my opinion). While this is a film with content that is steeped in historical Japanese culture, it portrays so many things that are undeniably human. It comes from a time when cinema still aimed at being the one artistic expression that could cross cultural boundaries like no other. Offering audiences from any background the chance to share an experience that connected with our most basic elements of humanity, and could result in creating shared experiences. As opposed to today's cinema that aims at polarization in the name of creating ""buzz."" This what movies should aspire to be and what filmmakers should aspire to make.Also, there's swords!",Seven Samurai

The last scene, heavy rain came out, everyone went home. Two young left behind.
Kikuchiyo took all the knives out at the last scene.

694,royalassassin603,A little dated,4,12 December 2007,"This movie is a good movie. It is well made, has a great storyline, has good acting and is interesting. It is a novelty, for sure. The problem with this movie is that it was made over 50 years ago and that wears on action movies. On movies like Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, It's a Wonderful Life etc. etc. They are timeless, they don't put a big emphasis on special effects and action scenes. This movie relies on them! And while I am sure that they were state-of-the-art in 1954, the action scenes are boring, by today's standards. I know people will take offense to this, but try showing this movie to anyone who doesn't have prior knowledge of Kirosawa's reputation. They won't like this movie.",Seven Samurai
695,ipknip,The Seven Samurai,10,12 February 2006,"The story of a small village plagued by bandits in feudal Japan. The movie follors the villagers attempts to stand up to the bandits by fortifying the village and hiring samurai protectors. This Kurosawa's most widely regarded film and rightly so. Superbly written and directed, with high action and emotion.Watch out for the star performance from Kurosawa regularly Toshiro Mifune as the drunk (Kikuchiyo).The story like so many of Kurosawa's works was later picked up by Hollywood director John Sturges and remade into one of the all-time western classics 'The Magnificent 7' starring amongst others Yul Brynner and a young Charles Bronson. The original story being so strong that even the remake turned out a good film. (And thats a rarity!!) Sit back and enjoy over 200 minutes of cinematic excellence.",Seven Samurai

697,pilot_5,Are you crazy?,3,22 November 2020,I think this film was full of illogicalities. War tactics are very poor and comic. Enemies were also a bit mindless. There were no need to become died main Samurai characters because of such basic faults during war. Does not anybody know to shoot arrows? I realised a few core faults like these. I can not understand the 9 and 10 points for this film.,Seven Samurai
