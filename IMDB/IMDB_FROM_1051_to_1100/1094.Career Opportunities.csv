0,SnoopyStyle,dream opportunity,7,10 April 2016,"Jim Dodge (Frank Whaley) is a dreamer, a fibber, constantly getting fired, and highly unlikely to leave home anytime soon. His father is eager to kick him out and forces him to take a job at Target. He's the night clean up boy who is locked in overnight by himself. Josie McClellan (Jennifer Connelly) is the town's rich girl who is looking to escape her corrupt businessman father. She chickens out of shoplifting but ends up falling asleep in the dressing room. The unlikely couple is joined by petty criminals Nestor Pyle (Dermot Mulroney) and Gil Kinney (Kieran Mulroney).It's every boy's dream to be locked in a Target overnight with Jennifer Connelly. She is lovely and Frank Whaley's talkative character grows on me. This is not a critical success but nobody can deny Jennifer in her white tank top. It's fun to rollerskate through the store.",Career Opportunities
1,gavin6942,Lesser-Known John Hughes Film,6,30 July 2013,"Josie (Jennifer Connelly), the daughter of the town's wealthiest businessman, faces problems at home and wishes to leave home, but is disorientated. Her decision is finalized after she falls asleep in a Target dressing room, and awakes to find that she is locked in the store overnight with the janitor, Jim (Frank Whaley), the town ""no hoper"" and liar.For a film that is written and produced by John Hughes, this comes off as a bit of a disappointment and it is no surprise that this has been largely forgotten. Not even the star power of a young Jennifer Connelly can save this one.What went wrong? The soundtrack? The direction? The plot? This is hard to say. There is a lot of potential involved in two young people locked in a Target. Heck, Hughes did wonders with a few kids put in a detention hall (library). This one has its good moments and a lovable loser (not unlike Ferris Bueller), but just never takes off.",Career Opportunities
2,lee_eisenberg,quite opportune,7,20 July 2006,"We've all had problems with our jobs, but how a job can relate to relationship problems is something else. In ""Career Opportunities"", they develop that to an interesting degree. In this case, janitor Frank Whaley and popular girl Jennifer Connelly accidentally get locked in a department store overnight, and thus have to reassess their lives (especially when some thugs break in).Knowing that John Hughes was involved in this movie, we may expect it to be another ""Breakfast Club"" or ""Home Alone"". ""Career Opportunities"" is far superior to either of those. More than an excuse to look cool or cute, this movie dissects the characters' lives: he's the guy who no one ever thought could make something of himself, she's the pampered teenager primed for a world of excesses. And it's up to them how they deal with this sticky situation.Anyway, this isn't a masterpiece, but I still recommend it. Also starring Dermor Mulroney, and John Candy in a bit part.",Career Opportunities
3,BA_Harrison,A weak comedy only worth seeing for Jennifer Connelly.,4,31 December 2006,"Frank Whaley plays Jim Dodge (Frank Whaley), a thoroughly annoying smart-mouthed wise-ass waste-of-space with a dead end job as a night janitor in a supermarket. Jennifer Connelly plays Josie McClellan (Jennifer Connelly), a poor little rich girl desperate to get away from her millionaire daddy (who beats her). When Josie chickens out of shoplifting at the last minute, she is locked in the shop for the night and meets Jim (as he roller-skates down an aisle in his boxers and a wedding veil!). Together they do a bit of collective soul-searching, swap sob stories and decide to run away together. However, their plans are interrupted somewhat when a couple of gun wielding thieves break into the store...Despite being written by top teen-movie maker John Hughes and featuring a pretty decent cast (John Candy has a cameo and the two leads are both capable actors), Career Opportunities (AKA One Wild Night), is a rather weak comedy with irritating characters and very few laughs.I, like most males who have reviewed this movie on IMDb, do agree, however, that it is worth viewing if you are a fan of Jennifer Connelly and her very impressive curves. The delectable JC looks stunning in a tight white vest and standout scenes include her rollerskating through the shop, and rocking slowly back and forth on a supermarket horse ride (a moment guaranteed to raise the blood pressure of all heterosexual men).But of course, Ms. Connelly looking damn fine doesn't make this a great piece of film-making (just great eye-candy), and ultimately this is a rather desperate 'comedy' that comes nowhere near to the matching the quality of Hughes' 80s output.",Career Opportunities
4,paul_haakonsen,Right on target...,6,4 July 2021,"I sat down to watch ""Career Opportunities"" for the second time now in 2021, after not having seen the movie since shortly after it was released.Needless to say that actress Jennifer Connelly (playing Josie McClellan) is the main attraction in this movie, no doubt about it. And she really is a talented actress, which ""Career Opportunities"" definitely also proves.This is a young adult comedy of sorts, but it does have elements of other genres to it as well. Throw in a little pinch of crime as well, and you have a great cocktail of a movie.The storyline told in ""Career Opportunities"" is a pretty straight forward one, and it is one that definitely is entertaining enough. However, I do think that the storyline told in ""Career Opportunities"" is actually not one that will find an appeal with just anyone in the audience, given the main character of Jim Dodge (played by Frank Whaley).Despite being released back in 1991 then ""Career Opportunities"" is a movie that very much still is watchable even now in 2021, now 30 years after it was released. And the movie does have that timeless feel to it, so that was quite some accomplishment on behalf of writer John Hughes and director Bryan Gordon.My rating of ""Career Opportunities"" lands on a six out of ten stars. If you haven't already seen this movie, you should do so, if you have the opportunity to do so. It is quite well worth the time and effort.",Career Opportunities
5,BandSAboutMovies,Could have been,6,9 June 2021,"Written and co-produced by John Hughes and directed by Bryan Gordon (a writer for Fridays that has gone on to direct Curb Your Enthusiasm, Freaks and Geeks and the Arnold Palmer 30 for 30 documentary), Career Opportunities was a rare misfire for Hughes.It does have one thing going for it and that's Jennifer Connelly after she made Etoile and Phenomena but before The Rocketeer. And I guess Target, which is pretty much a character in this movie in the same way that people say that New York City is a character.That's where Jim Dodge (Frank Whaley) and Josie McClellan (Connolley) are spending the night; him because he's an overnight janitor and her because she's been sleeping in one of the stockrooms after debating shoplifting to make her rich father angry.There's literally no conflict in this movie, as it's a series of montages until the crooks Nestor Pyle and Gil Kinney (Dermot and Kieran Mulroney) break in and threaten their lives, leading to Josie seducing them both by riding a child's quarter horse in the front of the store (this scene was pretty much the entire advertising campaign of this movie).Hughes would refer to this film as cheap, vulgar and a disappointment. Seeing as how he was behind it, this film was released in Germany as Kevins Cousin allein im Supermarkt (Kevin's Cousin Alone in the Supermarket). It does have some similarities - being left behind in a place the adults have left, two inept bandits and a winter in Chicago setting - but that's because this film and the somewhat similar elements in the Hughes scripted Dutch were both written before Kevin Arnold became a big deal.The John Candy cameo makes this movie.",Career Opportunities
6,studioAT,"My favourite John Hughes film. Yes, really",10,11 February 2020,"A very underrated John Hughes comedy about two teens stuck in a store overnight.Personally I thought this was great, good clean fun that hasn't dated, unlike some of the other works in the John Hughes canon (hi Sixteen Candles).Yes, it seems that the directors job was to make Jennifer Connelly look as attractive as possible (the scene on the mechanical bull anyone??), but in all seriousness there's some lovely moments here.The dialogue is sparkling, and the plot just about hold up.

7,Uriah43,Light and Breezy,5,22 November 2013,"""Jim Dodge"" (Frank Whaley) is an unambitious but very creative young man who can't seem to hold a job because he prefers to live in a fantasy world. Even though he is 21 years-old he still lives with his parents and doesn't really care to move out. One day his father, ""Bud Dodge"" (John M. Jackson) forces him to get a job at a nearby Target store as the ""night cleanup boy"". When he reports for his first shift the head custodian locks him in the store and Jim finds himself all alone with a huge area to clean. At least he thinks he's all alone. Meanwhile, a beautiful young woman by the name of ""Josie McClellan"" (Jennifer Connelly) is having problems with her rich and physically abusive father, ""Roger Roy McClellan"" (Noble Willingham) so she decides to venture to Target with the intent to embarrass him by getting arrested for shop-lifting. As luck would have it, she falls asleep in the clothing department and wakes up to find Jim skating through the aisles in his underwear. But that's just the beginning of the adventure for both of them. Anyway, rather than disclose what happens next and possibly spoil the picture for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a nice little comedy with a definite 80's flavor. While Frank Whaley was amusing, the main attraction was clearly Jennifer Connelly as she was simply gorgeous. On the other hand, the conversation between the two of them sometimes seemed awkward and forced. Likewise, because this film is so light and breezy there isn't much depth to it at all. All things considered then, I rate this movie as average.",Career Opportunities
8,bombersflyup,Bad.,3,26 November 2019,"Career Opportunities is a childish film, with no point or anything redeeming.You watch because Jennifer Connelly's in it, no other reason. All the other characters and performances including Whaley's are awful, minus a brief John Candy appearance. The Mulroney brothers are cringe-worthy, but you continue to watch because of Jennifer Connelly. Prior to the robbers coming into it, Jim has racked up like ten times the expense of what he's being paid to be there and that doesn't include the limo. So why even go in? Well because of the random occurrence of the girl, making all that stuff irrelevant. Woo-hoo!",Career Opportunities

10,Mr-Fusion,"Long on runtime, short on laughs, but thank heavens for Jennifer Connelly",4,18 April 2013,"On the whole, ""Career Opportunities"" is disposable fluff; a half-assed John Hughes production from a guy whose heart clearly isn't in the work anymore. It's uncharacteristic of the man in that the characters are unrelatable, the hot-girl-falls-for-the-big-talking-loser storyline is contrived, and this thing just crawls ... and then ends abruptly. It's 80 minutes of jokes that just don't land, and it's no surprise that both Hughes and Jennifer Connelly have disowned the flick. But both leads put forth the effort. Frank Whaley strives with what he's got, and Connelly adds playful sexuality to her dialogue. Everyone in the supporting cast knows they're here for a paycheck, but the stars at least make a go of it. And John Candy shows up for a very pleasantly surprising cameo in the film's beginning. The problem there is that his scene finishes and we never see him again. Man, that guy is like a beam of sunshine in every movie he's in. He makes it look so easy.But let's not beat around the bush here. The real reason this movie made any money at the box office (and is still talked about today) is the 20 year-old Jennifer Connelly. This doe-eyed specimen is unbelievably sexy, and we can all be thankful to the Internet gods for the horse-riding .gifs floating around in cyberspace. Just like the frozen-in-time Target filming location, this movie is a celluloid preservation of her pre-anorexic youthful attractiveness. Her beauty is nothing short of sublime in an otherwise forgetful piece of early-'90s ""meh"". 4/10",Career Opportunities
11,StevePulaski,The Opportunities in 1999,10,4 July 2010,"Finally! We get a film, taking place mostly inside a store. One of my favorite settings in a film. This one takes place in ""Target"", which, believe it or not was around in 1991. I know some people might know that, but thats news to me.The film is about Jim Dodge (Frank Whaley) a typical slacker who applies for a well-paying job, but instead gets to work as the night clean-up boy in Target. On his first shift, his trainer leaves him in a locked store with all the lights off. He says he will come back to unlock the door at 7 AM. Jim, unwillingly, turns all the lights back on and finishes his duties early then plans to slack around till dawn.He meets Josie McClellan (Jennifer Connelly) a run away girl and typical ""spoiled rich girl"", who purposely stayed in the store after closing. They then get to know each other, and have some fun while being locked in the store. Till they discover a criminal duo (Dermot Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney) have broken into the store holding the teens hostages. But the tables have really turned.The dialogue in this movie, like most John Hughes Comedies, are funny memorable and quotable lines not used often in current films. Not to mention 80s and 90s morals rarely seen in movies that meet the needs of today's standards.""Career Opportunities"" was a very overlooked movie when released in theaters. It had minimal commercials, plus with known blockbuster competitors like ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", and ""Dances With Wolves"" we can see why it did poorly.

12,lost-in-limbo,Hanging out after closing.,5,28 January 2010,"A sweetly charming and rather simple-minded teen movie penned by John Hughes and starring an unforgettably ravishing Jennifer Connelly. Too bad the rest of the film isn't as memorable as the talented Connelly. ""Career Opportunities"" isn't really a bad film, but just doesn't set itself apart from the crowd with few too little jokes and amusing interactions/situations. The story's structure is quite slight (too so) with the witty script going beyond the comedy at times to delve within serious/complex inner characteristics. Although nothing too detailed, there's some food for thought in its absorbing character driven set-up. However it's the lively performances that do the job. A buoyant Frank Whaley effectively creates a character who lives in his own comfortable world (getting fired from one job after another) and makes a perfect combination with Connelly (who's looking to rebel against her wealthy father's influence). Dermot Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney are comically fun, but are rather secondary. John M. Jackson and Noble Willingham are productively good in their snappy father roles. John Candy gets an enjoyable little cameo too. Director Bryan Gordon's controlled style is peculiarly brash, but doesn't have a whole lot to work from. He brings a colourful soundtrack to give the atmosphere its playful air, which the retail company Target gets a fair plug. Just make sure you get that product in shot and why not test it out too. Likable, but indistinguishable (well definitely not Connelly!).",Career Opportunities

The reason for that is, his character is like a woodpecker always nagging your shoulder and won't get away from you.

Josie gets herself locked up in the Target's ladies dressing room trying to shoplift a $20.00 pair of ladies underpants even though she had as much as $52,000.00 of cash on her to pay for it and ends up having the run of the place.

And in the end goes off with her to sunny California to start a new life as well as career opportunity in the up and coming multi-billion dollar industry of Silicon Valley.

As for actor Frank Whaley with the exception of playing accused but not proved JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in movies like ""JFK"" & ""Fatal Deception Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald"" he never had a part in a film as good or satisfying with a co-star as Connelly as the lowly Target night time clean-up boy Jim Dodge in ""Career Opportunities"".",Career Opportunities

17,RavenGlamDVDCollector,Opportunities to watch a young Jennifer Connelly,7,28 May 2017,"As the movie started, I reeled back. Could this be it? The right disk in that box? What the hell, this photograph of a bloody corpse? I knew nothing about this movie, there was some research on THE HOT SPOT's Jennifer Connely after INVENTING THE ABBOTTS's trailer on the Internet ruled it out as a good choice (though I did obtain it after all, but that's another story, see the review) and on Wikipedia I saw this one listed but all I could find on it was dodgy slow motion snippets which (ahem) conclusively proved that some guys were ga-ga about Jennifer way-back-then SO this is the stuff I collect, so, cut to the chase, I thought she was some kinda shopgirl new at the job (the ""career opportunity"") in romantic comedy and here it starts off all murderous.And then, this Frank Whaley dude. Who instantly reminds you of the kind of dorky, dorky guys in 80's music videos, the kind that carried a tune but looked like a dog's breakfast... Arrgh. And I was sitting there viewing this and really feeling like I usually do on movie afternoon Sundays, no surprise! My pursuit of the pretty girls on film landed me with another bummer! And this bummer is a big, big stinker. Comes the drag roller-skating scene. He thinks he's imagining her maybe as she stands there while he is making a fool of himself. I can SO relate to that. From there on, the movie gets a green light from me.It is a must for Jennifer Connelly fans. Umpteen years ago I saw her in THE HOT SPOT with that shiny long, long hair and wearing those flowery summer sandals and I have fond memories of that. I did see THE ROCKETEER for no other reason than JC, but my memory of that one is next-to-zilch. She was the older girl in recently-watched INVENTING THE ABBOTTS but completely outclassed my old flame Liv STEALING BEAUTY Tyler, so I got me this title to further my appreciation. And while the movie won't be in the vast majority's taste, no prize for guessing that, it's one of the best Opportunities to watch a young Jennifer early on in her Career. Very, very Brooke Shields, by the way.Basic premise, gentle loser-boy fantasy stuff. What if She (my dream girl) was here now while I was going through my usual boring old routine.

18,vertigo_14,Searching for the meaning of life...at Target.,6,12 March 2004,"If you love John Hughes' movies...and it's likely many of you would...then give Career Opportunities a try. It is quite an unusual teen comedy when compared to the earlier Hughes' catalog of the same genre. Frank Whaley plays Jim, the ""town liar."" Though he's fibs about grandiose adventures, he's really a high school grad stuck in a rut in a small suburban town. Jim finds an all-night job at Target as the ""night clean-up boy,"" and on his first night, he finds a bit of romance, captures some stupid crooks, and mulls over what exactly he plans on doing with his life. This isn't a typical John Hughes' setting. Teens (or kids in their early twenties) are forced to consider what happens next after high school? Is that to be the best years of their lives? They're forced to deal with more adult issues than Samantha Baker's boy problems in Sixteen Candles or socialization issues in The Breakfast Club. Career Opportunity, although it is a comedy, deals with some rather sensitive issues. For example, Jennifer Connely plays a rich girl who addresses issues of abuse, though the writers don't dwell on it for more than a minute or two. But on the other hand, the movie does address a few of those things typical of John Hughes's films, particularly that of the class differences (Whaley's character is blue-collar, while Connelly's character ""owns the collective wealth of the whole town."")Nonetheless, it is a somewhat funny film that has its moments. Frank Whaley gets to have fun with the merchandise while working alone at Target. The Mulroney brothers appear as two of the dumbest crooks trying to rob the store. And there's good stuff with Jim's boss, played by William Forsythe, and his interviewer, portrayed by John Candy. Even the folks are funny. And, it's got a super soundtrack.If you like it, I recommend checking out more Whaley and Connelly titles as they are great, yet highly underrated actors (and even after Connelly won the Oscar for her role in 'The House of Sand and Fog').

He's also the so-called hero of this movie, which aims to be funny (it's not), insightful (it ain't), and ultimately encouraging (don't get me started). After blowing just about every other employment opportunity in town, Jim takes a job as the night janitor at the local Target, where he ends up getting locked inside with Connelly, playing more a male fantasy than fully-realized character. Even by John Hughes' shaky standards (he wrote and co-produced), the central relationship is labored and wholly unbelievable; the most promising supporting players, such as Jim's supervisor (Forsythe), vanish just when they start to gain traction. Whaley seems to be trying to imitate Ferris Bueller and misses wide; he's typically an endearing presence in smaller roles, but often falls short on the rare occasion that he steps up to lead (see also: ""Swimming with Sharks""). Does have two things going for it, though: Connelly roller-skating in a tight tank top, and a mercifully brief running time (minus the credits, not even 80 minutes).31/100",Career Opportunities

22,TheUnknown837-1,"""Career Opportunities"" suffocates itself with its climax, draining all of the inertia and charm that I uncovered in the first hour of the movie.",6,13 September 2012,"""Career Opportunities"" has one of the most insufferably awful third acts that I have seen in a long, long while. The end of this picture, which is sort of a sly 80-minute Target commercial, concludes with two young people in love (Frank Whaley and Jennifer Connelly) trapped inside of a supermarket with two bungling burglars (Dermot Mulroney and Kiernan Mulroney). The burglars are the consummate villains for an idiotic comedy, and the whole plot of the third act, with the Mr. Whaley and Miss Connelly attempting to outsmart them using wits, deception, as well as sexual temptations is utterly dreadful. The last thirty minutes of this picture drags its feet so heavily—exhausted with its own plot mechanics—that it seems all too eager to end itself, and so it does. ""Career Opportunities"" suffocates itself with its climax, draining all of the inertia and charm that I uncovered in the first hour of the movie. Only a truly bad ending can do that.The initial two-thirds is well-assembled, even if it is mostly a bloated Target advertisement. I wonder who funded the picture. Frank Whaley and Jennifer Connelly give superb performances as two troubled young adults, the former a son of a ne'er-do-well family who cannot hold a job to save his life, the latter as a wealthy socialite's daughter who will stop at nothing to enrage her emotionally distanced parent. I enjoyed the setup with Mr. Whaley getting a last-ditch job as the night clean-up boy at Target (after misbelieving that he was getting a six-digit executive salary when the hiring manager mixes up the applications), being locked inside the supermarket, and messing around instead of doing his job. Miss Connelly, who fell asleep while shoplifting (once again trying to infuriate her father), finds him skating around in a tutu. With a girl as pretty as Miss Connelly hanging around, Mr. Whaley, of course, keeps shirking his responsibilities and the movie evolves into a sort of retrospective on the characters' pasts with what could have been and what just might be around the corner in their lives.Of course, that's all before the burglars arrive and the movie completely goes downhill. It is a real shame, because again, the first hour has a subtle charm. Mr. Whaley is excellent as the fast-talking, self-delusional hotshot who slowly realizes he's not all he makes himself out to be. He's sort of a ramped-up, modern Andy Hardy. Miss Connelly is also very good, although the screenplay frequently forces her to play the sexual teasing a little too far. At one point, she taunts the burglars upon a coin-operated horse ride, and the camera only shows her from the waist up as the ride thrusts her body up and down in a manner that is much too blatantly suggestive. They have some nice chemistry together. I just wish the filmmakers had had the wits to rewrite the third act and save ""Career Opportunities"" from plummeting into utter failure.Is it a complete failure with so much going for it in the beginning? From a fair standpoint, perhaps not. But judging from how limitlessly exhausted I became and how eager I was to see the movie end after those two robbers broke into the store, it just might be. I must give credit to the filmmakers—and the two stars—for what they did so stupendously well at the beginning, but cannot overlook the egregious errors that consume not just the end, but the whole resolution.",Career Opportunities

Over the night the two bond with Josie venting her frustrations with her wealthy abusive father and Jim about the mundanity of his smalltown existence.Produced and written by John Hughes, Career Opportunities marks the feature debut of Bryan Gordon a writer on Laugh In and Fridays who had previously won an Academy Award for Best Short Subject for Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall. While produced and written by Hughes, he was reportedly so dissatisfied with the final product citing studio interference that he tried to take his name off the final film only to be refused by Universal following the success of Home Alone desiring to capitalize on the association. The film would mark the final teen film for Hughes until the mostly buried Reach the Rock with Hughes' focus shifting entirely to slapstick shenanigans comedies. The movie is unfortunately not a high point for Hughes and it's clear why Hughes wanted his name removed.Frank Whaley is incredibly unlikable as Jim Dodge, with his unearned pride, ego, laziness and brazen lying he's about as unappealing a lead I've seen in a film like this. While Ferris Bueller is often jokingly referred to as a sociopath at least that movie sets itself up in a world of escapist High School fantasy that makes it clear it's aware of the silliness of its premise. Career Opportunities on the other hand isn't framed the same as Ferris Bueller's Day Off and plays more like if you crudely inserted Ferris Bueller into the Breakfast Club. Jennifer Connelly seems confused as to what movie she's in as she plays her role very straight with a tonally out of place subplot where her character is dealing with physical abuse from her father. While The Breakfast Club was a serious character study about high school archetypes, Ferris Bueller was meant to be a fantasy and here Hughes has basically taken his two films and stapled them together with little regard to whether they should fit together. The movie doesn't work as a comedy because it often has no one serving as a straightman to Jim's antics, the movie doesn't work as a romance because Jim's character and Josie don't feel like they're from the same movie with rather heavy material of Connelly's character conflicting with the almost ""Bugs Bunny"" like demeanor with which Whaley carries himself.Career Opportunities is a bad movie, it's a mishmash of tones and storybeats that simply don't belong together. Maybe if the film had tried to be either more character based or more of an escapist comedy it might have worked, but as is there's really nothing here that wasn't done better in past Hughes projects.",Career Opportunities
25,itamarscomix,A lesser Hughes classic,6,21 November 2013,"John Hughes wrote but didn't direct this one, and it shows, Frank Whaley is a slacker and a chronic liar who spends his first night as a night janitor at Target and hooks up with runaway rich girl Jennifer Connelly.The second act is quite good and has some elements of The Breakfast Club - existential, one-location story about the interaction between very different people. The third act completely misses its mark when the plot is interrupted by two robbers, and it turns into a Home Alone clone and ends on a very unsatisfying note. Connelly is very very good though and Whaley is good too, similar to but more likable than Broderick's Ferris Bueller.",Career Opportunities

UNTIL, they prove they are more aware of their children as they realize. The Paul Dooley character in ""16 Candles"" comes to mind.The other are these really tiresome archetypes of high school. The geek and the rich bitch. I grew up around these times and I was unaware that there these polarizing groups. No one really cared about class, as much as they cared about just getting tail. And the rich girls at our school didn't care. They went for the rebels (which I guess is what it came down to in ""Breakfast Club.""). I just never seem to see what these Hughes-like characters are. Just one dimensional buffoons. Frank Whaley, in typical nebbish way, is passable as a Duckie character. He seems to aware that he's playing the town joke. That he should be a salesman due to his ability to lie (unconvincingly, mind you). Just one ridiculous lie after another that fits well with television, but seems weird on the big screen.

I found this movie endearing and funny. Frank Whaley is probably one of the best and most underrated character actors out there.

That said, her career has worked out just fine in the long run though in today's cultural sensibilities it may be correct to look back and say that producers and directors focused or even took advantage of her breathtaking looks to such an extent that they did not do enough to bring out her top-shelf acting abilities.Aside from Connelly, the second highlight is a short scene with John Candy in which he just hits it out of the park.

33,Jakemcclake,Jennifer Connelly - WOW! The movie itself was also alright. Also this movie is about Acting Skill,8,27 August 2009,"Spoilers The phrase ""Jennifer Connelly Wow"" can be found all over the internet. Hollywood had never seen the likes of Jennifer Connelly before. She is an incredible beauty. I write this 18 years after this movie came out and she still is the hottest woman in Hollywood. There are favorite scenes of Jennifer - The roller skating scene and the rocking horse scenes are near the top for most guys and they are all over Youtube. Jennifer can really distract a guy from seeing what takes place in this movie. The first 20 times I saw this, I had the following questions: 1) Does Josey McClelland (Jennifer Connelly) really like Jim Dodge (Frank Whaley)?2) Since Jim Dodge is considered the town liar and can not seem to hold a job, what does Josey McClelland see in Jim Dodge? What kind of future could she possibly see with Jim Dodge? 3) If Josey likes Jim so much, why does she leave him in the store and drive off, when she steals the crooks' stolen car? Consider, Josey left Jim locked in a store with two angry criminals that subsequently began to look for him with loaded guns.Answers - Well the answers are demonstrated and shown by where the movie winds up. 1) Yes - Definitely!2) She sees that he is honest with her, except for not admitting to himself as well as her, that he does not want to live at home, and he is misunderstood by everyone in this little town including his parents, and everyone sees that Jim is doing something but they call it lying. But Josey has a similar talent and therefore, understands what Jim is good at, and where they need to go to take advantage of their talents. 3) She knows that those two stupid crooks have easily fallen for Jim's lies and acting previously - They are in no way a match for the talents of Jim Dodge. Consider the fantasy (from the leading male or Jim Dodge prospective) that those answers prove out: The sexiest woman comes into your store and is locked in with you for the night. The incredible beauty falls for you, big time, and she sees something about you that no one in this town ever saw. She knows that you are better than any problems that might come along, much better. Because she shares this talent with you The talent she sees in you has been on display for everyone to look at and you even have a nickname pointing to it, and somehow no one ever looked at the positives related to it, except her. Then you give her a point blank demonstration your talent, showing how you can convince two killers by talking into a radio that you picked off the Target shelf and then talking into some little red book, that they are surrounded by men with guns trained on them. This makes her jump for joy, literally. She knows the answer that you don't. The answer she forces you to see, move! You are lying to yourself in thinking you like living at home. Get out of your parents house and get away from this little town and find a place that people appreciate the fact that you are the world's greatest ""liar"". someone who can easily and naturally make people believe something you are pretending to be. You are therefore, a super talented ACTOR! You go through the town in one last view of it with her than without even saying goodbye, you move out of your parents house and together with her you go to (you guessed it, the place where actors go) Hollywood, California, where the story ends up.",Career Opportunities
34,Ziglet_mir,"Not Perfect, but Fun",6,25 August 2009,"One of John Hughes' underrated gems! I rented this movie already possessing knowledge of what it was about, who was in it, and what other people thought about it from their comments. ""Career Opportunities,"" had plenty of laughs along with some deeper, emotional setback drawn out between Whaley and Connelly, who of course both played their parts VERY well. And every other guy who hasn't seen a young Jennifer Connelly... should. The story unfolds smoothly as we find out more about the lives of two small town people.It's a movie where the characters are trying to understand where the rich, abused, dreaming, ""tease"" and dweebish, hopeful, incompetent ""town liar"" come from. There is also a sweet connection they develop from just talking about their lives and how they've changed since they last met. The more we hear and develop feelings for these two confused people, the more we can illustrate their current dilemma of being trapped within the lives that their families want them to live.The soundtrack was pretty great! One of the best soundtracks I have heard in a comedy.Dermot and Kieran Mulroney did a nice job playing some goofy small town crooks. However I thought the whole burglar part of the movie could have been achieved in better ways-- but it is what it is.If you do watch this film look out for a cameo appearance from John Candy as the Target Team manager who gives Whaley his janitor position. Very funny... and casual.Altogether, very well done and VERY underrated. I still don't understand why Whaley didn't become a bigger star after this movie such as Broderick did with Ferris Bueller.

In a touching scene the janitor asks the beauty to finish a dance he never got to finish with her in grade school.

I happened to rent this movie during the week the John Candy passed away, so all John Candy movie were discounted rentals.

Candy plays a hiring manager for Target who thinks he has to offer benefits to a professional candidate, instead he has an entry level high school young man.

41,pleiades10,Seems like a greatest hits portfolio from John Hughes.,6,7 October 2000,"Career Opportunities is a guilty pleasure of mine. I saw it for the first time last year, but I've since bought the movie, and watched it several times. The plot has several different characters ending up in an unlikely situation. Frank Whaley stars as an unmotivated pathological liar, who is starting his first shift as a night janitor at a Target store. Jennifer Connelly plays a lovely, but frustrated rich girl who just wants to get away from her father's numbing influence. And Dermot and Kieran Mulrooney portray two inept criminals, intent on looting the Target. The first third of the movie is similar to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", in that Whaley is avoiding responsibility, and frequently has clever comments to the camera or other characters. The middle third reminds me of the ""Breakfast Club"", when Whaley discovers Connelly in his store after hours, and the two sit down to get to know each other. The final third is very reminiscent of ""Home Alone"" in the way the two criminals threaten Whaley and Connelly, and the way they get outsmarted. Nowhere near as violent as Home Alone, but still similar in tone.All of this makes for quite the fun film. Whaley is hilarious, especially when amusing himself alone in the store, Connelly is good as the ""poor little rich girl"" that just wants her freedom. Plus, she's an absolute knockout! The Mulrooney brothers are disgusting and slimy as the villains, and it's very satisfying to see them get everything that's coming to them.

Next, much of the cast seem like they're doing impressions of characters from other films rather than finding their own truth. If we're going to spend an entire movie in a Target, there has to be something creative about the locale or the characters. The film has a few moments that resemble a Hughes film, the slow dance they share being his only wish is sweet for example. The male lead does fine, an interesting choice, but I think they should have gone with a pencil necked teen & dropped the stay-at-home aspect of the character. He could have been doing his first adult job during the summer or something. Moments could have been sweeter and with more heart.",Career Opportunities

Unfortunately the brilliance is in short supply for this movie. There are just ridiculous scenes that are not funny, and the characters are incredibly underdeveloped. It just feels like the film was thrown together and filmed in about a week, with a rush job at editing, and with the poorest musical choices in any Hughes film (which are usually a strong point).While there are a few (I mean VERY few) enjoyable moments, I just cannot recommend the movie in good faith to anyone except those that perhaps saw this when it was released and would enjoy it as nostalgia from a gone era.",Career Opportunities

The premise (at first) is a great set-up, and I would have enjoyed watching a full 80+ minutes of hijinx at a retail store. (I had to wait for Clerks for that to be realized.)  The movie is ruined by the introduction of the thieves. Perhaps Hughes felt he needed some ""Home Alone"" magic, or perhaps he didn't think the movie would have worked as an aimless satire (such as Breakfast Club was.)The chemistry between Whalley and Connelly is pretty good- the romantic angle definitely could have carried the film.I have to wonder how much Target paid to be the official store- I'm sure they expected a big hit- but it's kind of funny when you realize that they basically are advertising their lack of security, and ineptness of their employees.

The film has the classic Hughes devices of the solitary character posed before a background of merchandise or amusing themselves with objects that are actually merchandise of functional objects. Whatever happened to Leggs and dancing in the CD aisles? The music is reflective of the transitioning period of the late 1980's and early 1990's where hard rock, ""synth pop"" and alternative rock were duking it out on the charts. If you're lost on the placement of the story--in typical Hughes (R.I.P.)

Generally, Hughes films are about revealing the common ties among individuals who live in distinctly different social and economic strata where conflict resolves into a solidarity.I find it interesting that I watched this AFTER watching a modern ""living as a boy, who is old enough to live like a man"" film titled, ""Failure To Launch,"" an attempt to close the chapter on the pandemic of young ""adults"" returning to the nest, while this film seemed to signal the start of the pandemic.

Enter the crush interest, portrayed by the fabulous Jennifer Conelly. Josie is the daughter of a local bigwig, yet she seems disenchanted by what life in the small North Carolina Town has to offer. She is the apple of Jim's eye, and just about every other male's eye within the range of vision. Conelly really looked beautiful in this role. It was before she had dieted down to where she now has two pool cues for legs. Nowadays Conelly looks as if she's had two crackers a day for the last three years. And the nose job which makes her face seem sharper and pointier does not become her. But she looks amazing here as Whaley discovers after they've locked him inside the store for the night, to look after things and tidy up. Josie, you see, in an act of rebellion has locked herself inside the store in a botched shoplift attempt. And it turns out her and Jim are the only two people in the building. The dialogue between Jim and Josie is refreshing even if it isn't realistic. Jim is incredulously surprised when Josie identifies him as the town liar. Even though she doesn't mean it as an insult. But Jim does treat her like a person instead of a sex object and this is something that Josie is not used to. The two share TV Dinners in front of the electronics presentation and even a slow dance. And you can relate to the way Jim would feel in the presence of such a gorgeous creature. He does not want the Sun to come up. It's not perfect of course. Anyone would have a hard time believing that beauty Queen Josie would fall for the twerpish bullshitting Jim. And the actors are being too serious for comedic license. But the thing is, you want to believe it, and that only adds to the film's charm. Eventually, the whole thing starts to unravel and the film degenerates into the Hughes tradition of bungling burglars and other stupid nonsense, and the magic is lost. But for a brief time the suspension of disbelief makes us exist in this modest oasis of romance, and there's no red blooded American male who didn't imagine himself there with Conelly. But between the capable antics of the sidesplitting Whaley and the remarkable beauty of the breathtaking Conelly. They are more than enough to carry a film that definitely has some top moments. Credit Hughes for coming up with a good premise than finding the perfect actors to make it work. A very enjoyable and original romantic comedy. 7 out of a possible 10 T.H.",Career Opportunities
59,bdonut,Whaley as good as Bueller,8,20 November 2006,"Explain to me why after this Frank Whaley did not turn into a huge star? This is as good a turn as Matthew Broderick's in Ferris Bueller. Whaley carries this film with a swagger that defies belief. We've all known total BS artists post-high school like this. The opening scene alone is worth the price of admission. Definitely one of John Hughes underrated gems. Add to that the fact this will remind you of how hot Jennifer Connelly used to be before she got all stick figure on us in her adulthood. The violence I think really we could have done without. It seems a crutch many American flicks fall back on. I mean, how many comedies seem to want to put guns in them? Sorry, but how often does the average person actually see a gun pulled in their lifetime? It was really unnecessary to have the whole trapped in the store after hours and then have Connelly and Whaley held hostage.",Career Opportunities

I was actually removed from a Target store after putting on a pair of skates and skating around the store. No, it wasn't recently.The film itself is yet another awesome movie from John Hughes. The story flows well, and it's written well enough that you're not exactly sure what's going to happen.From the aspect of comedy, this film is hilarious, unless you lack a sense of humor.

There are some very funny lines, great songs, a beautiful girl, idiotic burglars (who included a bench bar with weights as part of their loot), and of course the non-negotiable scene for teen flicks: the dress up segment.

62,g-man-22,Lose the Curl (but not this fine guilty pleasure of a flick!),8,4 June 1999,"Okay, so this one never did (and never will) win any awards.  But pound for pound, John Hughes was never better and never will be again, most likely. Yes, I know, I know.  ""Ferris B."" is a more coherent, cohesive film.  And ""Breakfast Club"" has all the lines.  And ""Pretty in Pink"" has all the pathos, plus Ducky.  But this one's got Jim Dodge (F. Whaley).  Easily one of my favorite film creations ever.  You can't not love this guy.  Even in the usually dumb montages that plagues MTV-ish films of this nature, he's charming (wearing a veil and cow-boxers and rollerskating, for instance). And then there's Jennifer ""Eternally Easy on the Eyes"" Connelly who, yes, has her usual charms (both of them), but who manages to bring a degree of wit, grace and sincerity to the ""girl next door anyone would die to get with"" role that's rarely been matched since.  This film's full of terrific lines and memorable moments.  Jim's ""Jimget"" fantasy.  John Candy's entire cameo.  ""Could I get this uniform washed, it...smells a little like Darnell.""  ""You mean you've never heard of sashimi?""  ""The subsonic tummy bump...""  The list is endless.  The bad part: yes, the last 15 or so minutes are plagued by a lack of money and a lack of laughs (money as in it looks like they ran out and decided to end the film...now).  But the two leads are terrific together and the idea of them hashing out their high school trials and tribs in this particular setting is quite effective, really.  Sweet, simple, goofy and funny, this one deserves another look, despite the ""run out of steam in the last stretch of the race"" factor.",Career Opportunities
63,jafonte01,"Oh, what I would do with $52,000 Reagan-era dollars and eloping with Jennifer Connelly...",4,4 November 2014,"Imagine yourself as a compulsively lying geek. Now, imagine your geek-self in the late 1980s/early 1990s.This is Jim, the main character of Career Opportunities. He cannot hold a job in an era where jobs flow infinitely from a river of the Reagan heyday. As part of the generation of fresh college graduates without steady income, I envy the luxuries that Jim takes for granted.Amidst his quarter-life crisis of how Jim should be as an adult, he lands a job as a ""night clean-up boy"" at Target. While normally this would be seen as unimpressive, Jennifer Connelly as 21 year old Josie saves the day with her charm, striking incisors, and of course, her low-cut tops.As many of the other reviews on IMDb for this movie have stated: Jennifer Connelly makes this movie. To put it another way: there is no reason to watch this movie if the poignant Jennifer Connelly did not star. But she did, and with her voluminous bosom, she carried the film (to term).It goes without saying that her natural beauty can be construed as objectified sex appeal for this movie. I, as an open chauvinist male, agree that that was her purpose. As much as we critics mind the boorish measures that Universal Studios takes to promote this film, I honestly believe that Jennifer Connelly is okay with flashing smiles and cleavage the most of all; after all, she is the one laughing her way to the bank.And with that, the most salient theme is her physical objectification (coupling this with some visceral jazz saxophone solos really don't help). Red tops. Red necklaces. Riding mechanical ponies. These scenes were all attempts to distract my short-term memory from the pedestrian and pointless overall character of this film. For me, it worked.What is probably the most disconcerting aspect of this film is the protagonist Jim. He is an unwieldy and jejune boy. When encountered with a beautiful women, we as the audience are forced to endure the awkward bouts of puberty. Simply, we want to grab Jim by the throat and say, ""MAKE A MOVE! STOP F***ING LYING."" Yet, we experience his own demise.What I mean by the last line is that the film does not provide closure for the relationship between Josie and Jim (and where are we with Jim's father's late night eatings?! Surely, that contributes to the plot, right? Oh wait, that's right, I've given the film too much credit; those scenes have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO with the rest of the film). What happens is that **Connelly** saves the day, and Jim does nothing to deserve her.If you want to look for a film where obtaining a beautiful (and clearly objectified) woman is justified, then look somewhere else. Jim has done nothing to deserve her. And we as the audience are to watch this inconsistency realize itself before our eyes.And my eyes have melted. I want them back. This movie was not worth the loss of my vision. I hope you all can agree with that.",Career Opportunities

66,clarkejb,An under-rated Generation X film,7,1 January 2014,"Career Opportunities is a film worth a watch for a few key reasons. One reason is because the film is one of the last major projects of the great John Hughes. I wanted to take time out to watch this film recently because I never saw it when it was released back in 1991. I do not think I was ever aware of the film back then. As I watched the film, I asked myself why John Hughes chose to write and produce it. I think John wanted movie goers to explore the question, ""How would his teenage characters, from films like ""Pretty in Pink,"" ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" feel about their lives and their prospects for their future after their high school years are behind them?"" The Jim Dodge character is like many memorable characters created by John Hughes: A handsome, witty, fast-talking, and extroverted charlatan. Unlike The popular and successful Ferris Bueller character, Jim Dodge doesn't fool most of the people in his life. People see through his charlatan antics and regard him as a disingenuous liar. Jim Dodge is also from a modest working class family. The Jim Dodge character is as engaging as the Ferris Bueller character, but he is not as funny or as entertaining to watch because his charlatan behavior is unsuccessful. Jim Dodge was not cool in high school, he doesn't have any friends his age, and he doesn't have a gorgeous girlfriend like the Sloane Peterson character from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" I think Hughes wrote the Jim Dodge character to represent the slacker stereotype of Generation X. The Jim Dodge character is in his early 20s, he lives at home, he has few job prospects, and he lacks tangible goals other than a general wish to be credible and successful. The Josie McClellan character is strong-willed female lead who is similar to a lot of other John Hughes characters. Josie is an effortlessly beautiful young woman with a bad attitude. She believes her ideal high school experience means that her best days are behind her. She and Jim Dodge share a tremendous uncertainty about their futures, and they are both loners. Despite Josie's beauty and wealth, she feels as alone as Jim Dodge and she is also a slacker without clear goals. Jim and Josie find each other and bond within strange circumstances in ""Career Opportunities."" I think the film is really about how these two characters connect as fellow struggling Gen-Xers. I think this movie failed to be a big hit because Hughes offers no clear answers for the Jim and Josie characters other than the idea that falling in love offers hope for both of their futures. The laughs are not frequent enough in the film and the music sequences are too numerous. The title of the film is also misleading. Regardless, this film is definitely worth a watch if you were born between 1966 and 1974.",Career Opportunities

When we're young, most of us don't realize how lucky we are just to be young and with possibilities of adventures ahead of us. But this ending shows the two characters very much realizing how lucky they are. The big band swing music just makes everything seem groovy, Frank Whaley and Jennifer Connelly pulling up in the limousine, stepping out to bask in their moment of triumph (to the amazement of the kids), Jennifer's GREAT bend at the knees/twirl and pulling him back in to the limo, the kid saying ""He is so cool,"" as they drive off and finally - Frank and Jennifer's self-aware cool, sitting by a swimming pool in Hollywood. How does it get better than that? It doesn't. That's it. But IMDb requires me to write ten lines of text or they won't allow my review. What's that all about? What about those 7 years I spent in college learning the craft of journalism (well, yeah, I did party a lot), training my mind to condense my thoughts efficiently, to hone my words to the barest minimum for maximum effect? Were all those books I studied by Ernest Hemingway and Hunter S. Thompson for naught? Now I'm being told to fluff the word count so that I can submit AN ONLINE REVIEW?! Well, I'm willing to do it for Career Opportunities. Many of the movies I see being made nowadays are downbeat, focusing on cruelty and the brutal nature of the modern world. It's so nice to take a trip back to the 80's when the message was ""Anything's possible if you've got the balls to try and a silver tongue like Frank Whaley or Bill Murray."" And one thing this movie has that Ferris didn't, is that Frank has to come to grips with his major flaw, and it's only when he does that, that he become a winner. Oh, and RIP John Hughes.

I was in love with Jennifer Connely long before this movie, but this movie made her go to my top 5 beautiful woman of all time list. She looks so good in this movie. The main character is so believable, sometimes the dialog seems a little too set up. Every guy who grew up in the late 80s or grew up in a similar type town can relate to this movie. Anyone who has worked in a store after hours has either done or thought of doing what happened in this movie. Also Hughes does a good job of living out every young mans fantasy of being locked in a place with a beautiful woman. Or having a chance to get with the hottest girl from school or in town. There's so many things to this movie it would take me forever to write it all. The music goes along with the movie perfectly. It also really adds to scenes that would be kind of boring otherwise. John Candy is great, the janitor is awesome, he does a great job for having such a small part. Mcdermot is pretty weird in the movie, it's hard to believe it's even him. A totally contrast from his characters in recent movies. The whole idea and story of the movie is well told and played out. I think the movie is entertaining from beginning to end.

88,baldgi,this movie is much deeper than most think,7,22 June 2005,"I get such a kick out of all the comments that mention how beautiful Jennifer Connelly is. Basically because in this movie that's all Josie's ever heard... how she's such a great piece of a$$ (""the town tease""), and the redundancy of these comments she's encountered up to now has her almost proud of that fact. ""... I never tease..."" But the truth is, nobody cares who she is as a person (including you the viewer), and that kills her. Those that have criticized and commented on the movie are actually characters IN the movie. As we comment on how beautiful Connelly is, we in turn become a part of Josie's past, and we are responsible for who she is now. Add the issues of her father, who only threatens her (and the cop) with abuse and attempts of control. Josie is physically beautiful, but that is her main problem. She's a really f'ed up chick. She is a temporary trophy, until something better comes along. And being that negative attention is better than no attention at all, you can understand what brought her to the store in the first place. When Jim tells Josie of his dream of her, she instantly thinks ""sex""... cause up until this point in her life, that all she has to offer anyone. She is instantly caught off guard when Jim suggests a simple dance, one that he's been dreaming of since the 7th grade. And of all the people Josie has ever been with, Jim is the first gentleman she's ever met. And for the first time in both of their lives, a true connection is made. Yes, the Home Alone skits are below average, but for me, the problem is that they take away from the connection that the two leads are making. The best part of this whole movie is the unspoken dialogue between Connelly and Whaley, as they tried desperately to comfort each other in this time of chaos. Whaley has most of the creative dialogue, but Connelly's character is the one of interest (and issues). This is a much more psychological romance than most give it credit for.",Career Opportunities
