0,SnoopyStyle,Great comedic talents but not enough laughs,5,20 March 2014,"It's shenanigans that the workers at Shenanigan's get up to. It's a suburban chain restaurant. Dan (David Koechner) is the manager. Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is a smart mouth server who takes trainee Mitch (John Francis Daley) under his wing. Dan offers Dean (Justin Long) the assistant manager position. Serena (Anna Faris) and Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday) are the hot waitresses. Then there are all the other workers played by Luis Guzmán, Chi McBride, Rob Benedict, Alanna Ubach, Vanessa Lengies, and Dane Cook.There are so many great comedic talents in this, and yet I can't find enough comedy in this. Writing/director Rob McKittrick is putting so much ridiculous comedy that some of it is bound to stick. Sure some of it sticks, but it's not enough. Maybe it's more funny to people who actually worked at a place like this. It's a scatter-shot comedy. It needs to concentrate on one single POV. I'd probably pick either Reynolds or Daley. Following so many characters kinda scatter the comedic effects.",Waiting...
1,wes-connors,I Looked Away,2,28 November 2009,"Jerk off waiters, waitresses, and other restaurant staff spew sophomoric humor for people who've never seen foul-mouthed comedies (or get off on them). The running joke, herein, is something called ""The Penis Game"" - you trick co-workers into looking at your exposed genitals. Then, if they look at your worm, you shout ""fag!"" and playfully kick their ass. Note, the ""Unrated and Raw"" DVD shows squat.Stuff like spitting on food is about what you'd expect. The caricatures will be recognizable to anyone who has worked in a ""Shenaniganz"". The philosopher-dishwasher (Chi McBride as ""Bishop"") and tightly-wound waitress (Alanna Ubach as ""Naomi"") are made to order. Justin Long (as Dean) does all right with the best-written role. But, this type of comedy can hardly ever keep it up. And, it doesn't.** Waiting... (5/12/05) Rob McKittrick ~ Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris, Justin Long, Rob Benedict",Waiting...
2,dbborroughs,Low Brow humor will prevent you from ever eating out again,3,16 October 2005,"The story of what happens over the course of a day at a restaurant is a low low brow romp thats vulgar and not very funny. The plot has the staff of a Shenanigan's(ha ha) trying to remain sane as they deal with management and the customers. If the idea of a running game of trying to get people to look at your privates excites you, by all means see this movie. For me its more frightening than funny. I know that if I had found this funny I would have forgiven it anything, but I didn't like the people (who were clichéd) nor the humor (obvious and old hat). Yes there are laughs, but not enough to make me rate this as anything other than a waste of time...especially when you're paying ten bucks to see it on the big screen. (Perhaps this will play better on the small screen) A word of warning: I've been told that some of what goes on in this movie is what goes on at places like Bennigans, Applbee's and TGI Fridays, if you don't want to have second thoughts about eating out, stay away.",Waiting...

Turgid, vulgar and crude 'comedy' about the shenanigans at Sheinaniganz, a TGIF manqué restaurant, with its staff of 'zanies' dealing with their dead-end jobs with gross out humor that just doesn't register (if you think a game of exposing genitalia a riot by all means this flick is for you) and Reynolds getting in touch with his inner Chevy Chase is steadily increasing in annoying affectations.

5,gradyharp,A Summer Doldrums Filler of a Film,4,11 February 2006,"Reading reviews of this slight little 'comedy', it seems the positive accolades come primarily from people who have been waiters: that is a good thing because it means writer/director Rob McKittrick managed to duplicate the experiences 'behind the scenes' of our eating establishments with authority.But a film that is self-absorbed about the manner in which a disparate group of young people spend their boring lives avoiding adulthood in a restaurant, aptly named Shenanigan's here, is a National Lampoon type potty mouth series of one liners that has little to recommend it unless you've experienced the life of a waitperson. The glimmers of light that manage to come through are due primarily to the easy nonchalance of Ryan Reynolds' acting. Otherwise the 'storyline' is a gaggle of gross-out in jokes that after the first fifteen minutes become numbing.It has been stated that this is a potential cult movie and supposedly that puts it in a class with 'Harold and Maude' (not in the same class at all!), the 'Rocky Horror Show', etc. There must be an audience for this type film because they just keep grinding them out. Ah, commercialism! Grady Harp",Waiting...
6,Sylviastel,An Acquired Taste!,7,8 July 2011,"If you break the cardinal rule about complaining about your food at a restaurant, please be aware that you're breaking the cardinal rule. This film is pretty interesting, offensive, and shocking at times. What did you expect anyway? While Rob McKitrick is a first time director and screenwriter. He has his own experiences of working at theme restaurants like Shenanigans. The cast is stellar including Ryan Reynolds as a waiter who introduces a new trainee around the place. They have a sick twisted game that they play. Anyway, the other cast members includes Alannah Ubach (Brady Bunch movie) where she's Naomi (a high strung waitress on the edge). Luis Guzman is hilarious but offensive in his role as a cook. Some cast members are familiar like David Koetchner who was on Saturday Night Live and Chi McBride who plays philosopher dishwasher, Bishop. Still, the film takes place in the day of the life of a restaurant. I can't forget Wendie Malick playing Ryan's mom. That's a good scene. Anyway, the film has some issues but it's worth watching. You can totally relate to it!",Waiting...
7,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Waiting...,7,8 July 2006,"If you had enjoyed Empire Records, which snapshots the exaggerated life of employees in a record store, then you'll enjoy Waiting..., which adopts the same formula, but for employees in a restaurant called the Shenaniganz. Either that, or you've worked in a restaurant before that you can identify easily with some of those nasty or nice customers you've encountered before. You are the folks that have inspired this movie.Waiting... refers to waiting on tables, i.e. the job of a waiter, and in this movie, there is a kaleidoscope of caricatures, like the newbie initiate, the resident cool guy hunk, someone at the crossroads of his life, wondering if this is a job that he'll be stuck to for the rest of his life, two cleaner junkie Eminem rapboys wannabe, a foul mouthed middle aged waitress, the hot chicks, someone whiny and have problems with his urine, an ineffective manager, lesbian bar attendants, and even a washerman who's everyone's shrink.And what makes the movie interesting, if it doesn't have its fair variety of customers, who provide an excuse for our jolly staff to demonstrate their shenanigan ways? It's a prompt reminder too, that everything that happens in the kitchen when your food is being prepared, trust me, you won't want to know. And please be courteous to the person serving your food too!The movie starts and ends with a party, with the various personalities coming together and chilling out after a hard day's work. And the highlight here, is probably the running prank known as ""The Game"". You got to watch the show if you're interested to find out more.The version shown locally is the unrated cut, so be prepared for plenty of swearing, close up and grossed out shots of genitalia, and a vulgarity filled end credit rap video which ends off by telling you to F-off from the theatre.Pretty fun movie, considering I'm just back from one heck of a hectic week.... cool movie to just unwind and laugh it all off.",Waiting...
8,siderite,"It's no Clerks, but it's occasionally funny",7,15 February 2016,"A small restaurant is the place where the movie happens, from start of the shift to its end. We have a ""rookie"" who will help us understand the goings on, a Ryan Reynolds who is happy to be a waiter just in order to be the coolest guy of the bunch, a Justin Long who wonders where his life is going, a Luis Guzmán who invented this ridiculous penis-flashing game to increase morale and a bunch of semi-known people who lend their talents to this film.The problem with the film is that it is purely character based, therefore we need to find the humor in the very personalities of the people shown. There is no action, no real moral to the story, just a bunch of people doing their thing. And even if Ryan Reynolds is his usual funny self, Justin Long is more of a lead than he is, a strange choice for a comedy considering his character is mostly tragic. Also, in order to ""make it funny"", you have the extra weird characters that lend humor, but subtract plausibility.There were some genuinely funny moments, but most of the time I was Waiting (sorry, couldn't help it) for something interesting to happen. I would say the movie did what it set out to do, but not very well.",Waiting...
9,Smells_Like_Cheese,I'm disgusted and repulsed and yet I can't look away,5,31 August 2007,"I don't know why I picked up Waiting..., but the only thing that got me is that I am a fan of Ryan Renolds and Anna Farris, both of them worked so well together in Just Friends, so I guess I was expecting the same chemistry in Waiting... So I watched it yesterday and this movie just had such 7th grade humor that I wasn't really impressed with it. But at the same time I was so disturbed at how much of this movie is probably true to real life, I tell you one thing, because of this movie I don't wanna go out to eat for a while. There were some funny moments, but at for the most part this was mostly just immature humor.The story takes place within one day of the waiters and cooks at a restaurant and what their lives are like. We have Morty, a guy who is pretty immature and charms his way through life. We have Serena, a hot girl who flirts her way through life along with the minor hostess who is a bit too disturbing. We have Dean who wants a grown up job; the cooks who love sex and a penis showing game. And the manager who is just the looser who wants these waiter's social lives, and a waitress who seriously needs to get a grip. And guess what? They're training a new guy who can't get one word in on what he thinks about all this.Waiting... is sometimes amusing and funny, where you might laugh out loud a couple times. But at the same time I think that you have to have a certain sense of humor to enjoy this movie, because I don't really understand it's decent rating on IMDb, but apparently this movie works for some people. So if you don't like gross out humor, I wouldn't recommend this movie, but if you're open, you could go ahead and give it a look and just judge for yourself.5/10",Waiting...
10,MovieAddict2016,"Not great, but entertaining",7,23 June 2006,"I found ""Waiting"" to be better than most comedies of its kind, and although it is very much a wannabe ""Clerks"" it still comes across as being quite entertaining. Unfortunately parts of the film go on too long and the juvenile moments - such as the kitchen antics involving the flashing of male genitalia - become stale very fast.Ryan Reynolds plays a smug waiter at a restaurant called Shenanigans where he finds himself with a wide array of co-workers, including Anna Faris of ""Scary Movie"" fame. Ultimately the movie chronicles a day in the lives of these people and what a pain the profession (if you can even call it that) can be.This movie is based on the writer/director's personal experiences as a waiter earlier in his life, and most of it really does happen to some degree. I always remember what a cook at a restaurant told me once - if you saw the kitchen in any place you'd never want to eat out again.The movie has fun with some restaurant in-jokes such as the ""five-second rule"" of dropping food on the floor and so on and so forth.I thought Reynolds was quite good but the dramatic arc of the story involving a waiter and his decision of whether to leave the job gets tiring. ""Clerks"" handled the drama better, and even ""Clerks"" wasn't a perfect comedy.I found most of the better moments to come from the supporting cast - despite his repetitive exposure scenes, Luis Guzman was still hilarious in his role as one of the chefs.Overall, I found this to be entertaining and more than what I expected - but it never quite achieves its full potential, either. If you've ever worked at a restaurant of any kind then you're likely to get some kicks out of this - but don't expect another ""Clerks.""",Waiting...
11,ksf-2,"hard work, little pay...gotta make it interesting",7,23 July 2021,"Stars Ryan Reynolds and Justin Long as servers in a sit down restaurant. We watch the antics, as the workers, in the front and back of the kitchen try not to die of boredom, very hard work, and very low pay. The best part of this film is the silly game the employees play to avoid being totally bored. This was made in 2005, back when this type of game was considered amusing fun, instead of sexual harassment. It's a fun look at working in a family restaurant. It's pretty good. Written and directed by Rob McKittrick. One of the two films directed by him so far.",Waiting...
12,KineticSeoul,If work was this fun,8,10 October 2009,"I will start out by saying that this is a funny movie, with some inside jokes. The reason I say this is cause if anyone has ever worked in a restaurant they will find this movie to be more funny than it is. This movie has some weird mix of characters and although they aren't fully developed they work great together, even the background characters. This movie shows what goes down in some restaurants but instead of making it boring, they do a hilarious job by making it over the top. Ryan Reynolds is cocky but likable, Anna Faris's character is different from a lot of her roles where she plays some oblivious chick, and Justin Long does a great job performing a depressed character that a lot of people might relate with. Some people might be turned off by it's immature humor, and cause this movie doesn't really have that good of a plot, will make some critics dislike this movie. But if you don't nitpick this movie and just enjoy it for what it is, you will most definitely enjoy it especially for those that can relate with the movie.8/10",Waiting...

14,Robert_duder,"Really nasty, crude humour that somehow works with a fun cast.",7,20 August 2010,"I read an IMDb review that truly summed up this entire film in the perfect sentence. ""Disturbing, disgusting, offensive, and better than I expected."" That is exactly what this was for me. I had heard about this film from so many people, how great and funny it was. I admit that many of those people work in the food industry so this apparently is like their ultimate vengeance film. The entire sch-tick to this film is the immature and insane things this crew does to their customers and to each other. Certainly if you have a weak stomach or you're easily offended in any way you'll want to steer far clear of this one because it takes toilet humour to new levels. I am not one to be a huge fan of gross out, body fluid and function humour but somehow this cast wins you over and makes you smile at the stupidity despite yourself. I think much of that can be attributed to Ryan Reynolds who was just getting his footing as the major star he is becoming now because he has terrific chemistry on screen and has a way of keeping you watching his antics. All this being said I think the film got its cult following from the millions of people that work in the food industry and dream of being this irresponsible.As mentioned Ryan Reynolds is a star. I can't think of a single role I haven't enjoyed of his and he is easily a versatile actor and a good actor. He proved his chops (in my opinion) in The Amityville Horror remake but comedy has always been his strong suit. He basically re-enacts his Van Wilder persona only in waiter form for Waiting. Still while the role isn't a big stretch for him he definitely keeps it entertaining and makes the humour seems not quite as stupid as it would without him. Anna Faris is terrific as the snotty and wisecracking waitress. Faris and Reynolds have awesome chemistry when they're sparring with words. Similarly to Reynolds Justin Long is becoming a star to reckon with. He is great at comedy and also playing the everyman and he succeeds again in Waiting. I think I would have liked to have seen him in a bigger role but for what they give him, he nails it. David Koechner does an awesome job as the sleazy restaurant manager. Veteran character actor Luis Guzmán is disgusting and rude and completely immature but his character works and he is good in his role. He gets plenty of funny moments in the film. John Francis Daley (who I've come to know and love through the TV Show Bones) is great as the new guy around the restaurant. He kind of just follows around Reynolds, getting shown all the ropes even the most inappropriate until his hilarious outburst in the end. Alanna Ubach deserves honourable mention as the psychotic waitress who is clearly teetering on the edge of sanity. I wish I had space to talk about the supporting cast because there are some decent funny performances from Chi McBride, and some horribly stupid and typical characters played by Max Kasch, and Andy Milonakis (think Jay and Silent Bob but even dumber.) Let me be clear that anyone that 'loves' this movie or thinks its a masterpiece needs their head examined. I score this a 7/10 because my expectations for toilet humour is extremely low because I think its a poor excuse for comedy. However, if one needs toilet humour you could do far worse than this thanks to a solid cast and decently created characters. Writer, director and creator of the film Rob McKittrick does well with the cast, especially given how many characters are in the film. I can only assume he himself has worked in a restaurant. This is really his only big claim to fame but it seems to have become a cult classic. He also self admittedly lists Kevin Smith and Clerks as a big inspiration for this film and that absolutely shows. So I think you can see from my review whether or not this film is for you. Silly, slapstick, gross, stupid, full of horrible restaurant gags and definitely in the vein of Kevin Smith comedies although not likely to the same standard. Still I look forward to checking out the straight to video sequel for this film just to see what they cooked up. 7/10",Waiting...
15,bowmanblue,My name is Deadpool and I will be your waiter this evening,7,28 April 2018,"Like many, I only really became - properly - aware of Ryan Reynolds after he finally got the chance to play 'Deadpool.' Since then, I've been through some of his previous work and I can't help but feel that he plays pretty much the same character (dare I say he simply plays Ryan Reynolds?!) in everything he's ever been in. I know that may sound a little dismissive of his acting ability, but all I can think of is that old phrase 'if it ain't broke... don't fix it!' And Ryan Reynolds' act is very watchable and keeps bringing in the money at the Box Office.Here, he plays - arguably - another version of himself (or Deadpool, depending on how you want to look at it) who's the oldest waiter in a restaurant filled with younger staff. The film follows a day in the life of the team as they do their best to deal with their own personal problems and - more importantly - the dreaded customers.If you're thinking 'this sounds a little bit like Kevin Smith's Clerks' then you're probably right. There are some definite similarities. It's very low budget and has a real 'raw' feel about it, plus the jokes are generally generated through how staff deal with awful customers in restaurants (but most gags work if you've worked in any job that's 'customer-facing'). Despite definitely being classed as a 'comedy' I wouldn't say there are that many 'side-splitting' moments, however I found I sat tight with a decent-size smile on my face throughout the ninety minute run-time. The humour is also quite 'adult' so expect 'American Pie' levels of humour.It's definitely a 'Ryan Reynolds' film and its success relies heavily on his sheer natural charm and likability. Anna Farris is about the other main name you'll recognise, but she does seem a little underused for what she's capable of bringing to a comedy film.Overall, if you've ever worked in a job that involves dealing with the public, you'll sympathise with the waiters/waitresses you meet here. It's a decent enough comedy that definitely has more 'hit' jokes than misses.",Waiting...

This movie is raunchy, hilarious, disgusting, and good fun for a whacky comedy. Ryan Reynolds, John Francis Daly, David Kochner, and Justin Long are all superb.

17,Floated2,Too many annoying characters and subplots,2,4 September 2010,"So I decided to watch Waiting... on DVD recently because I've wanted to see it a but never really got a chance. And when I finally seen it, I didn't really enjoy it as much as I expected. The movie seemed like a good idea but it was basically Clerks, which is not original. The movie starts out as at a party then transports itself into the restaurant where they all work. From there throughout the entire film is taken place until the very end when it also ends at a party. The plot of this film is non-existent. All it is, is employees waiting servers and talking about getting tips, and doing nasty things to the customers food.This movie runs on two gags, the so called game that the male workers play and the whole 'lets drop people's food on the floor' or do disgusting things to there food gag, and honestly neither work. You feel as though the script is very poorly written and almost wonder how the hell someone read this thing and approved it for a feature film. Also the script contains a lot more f-bombs then Id expected and the movie loved to use the word cock and penis like the movie was intended for a bunch of kids. The movie is rather pointless with no real plot and is extremely poorly written with one-dimensional characters. That was the biggest problem- there were too many random characters with pointless subplots. I know it takes place in a restaurant and they're a lot of workers, but they shouldn't have gave them all as much screen time with little subplots. Besides all the characters are annoying obnoxious, with a few exceptions of Justin Long's characters, and John Francis Daley's. The others really got on my nerves and it was full was stereotypical nonsense.So once again, the bottom line: I didn't laugh once in this film, I didn't like any of the characters, there was no point, and lastly there were no redeeming qualities at all. This movie was made for immature people who think that fart jokes and crude sex gags are still funny. The movie contains recycled jokes and one-dimensional characters. It was sorta interesting just seeing how these people stereotype employees working at restaurants. It was just a huge fail. But in the end, the negative reviews for this film are not a lie and the film deserves every one of them. I totally agree with one critic who states in his review ""The wait for laughs lasts the entire length of Waiting"" because this truly is a very unfunny and unoriginal film. I just don't see why this is rated so high on IMDb. As a rewatch 07 03 19' and nearly nine years since the initial watch opinions have relatively remained the same. Annoying and unlikable characters, forced gross out humor and a pot that doesn't really go anywhere. But seeing from some positive reviews, Waiting seems to be a film where those who like it, like it due to it being relatable and from having experience working at a restaurant.",Waiting...

19,insomniac_rod,Displays the truth about working in a restaurant.! But in a funny way.,7,18 January 2009,"First of all, I want to point out that Mexican film distributors translated the title of the movie as ""Not Another Food Movie"". What's the problem in my opinion? That the title is so misleading that makes you think about the CRAPPY ""Not Another..."" movies.The thing is that this movie is actually pretty funny and demonstrates the pros and cons of working in a restaurant. To say the least the movie is dedicated for a younger audience; for those young adults who earn a salary in exchange of bitchy attitudes, horrible customers and more.The situations are pretty funny and well done. Anna Faris, Justing Long, and Ryan Reynolds are great on their roles because they have plenty of comedic skills. I dug about Luis Guzman's performance.The humor is pretty absurd at some points but it fits perfect with the movie's tone. This is the kind of movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon.",Waiting...
20,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Keeping the comedy in close parameters helps ""Waiting"" deliver the laughs",7,30 December 2009,"I liked ""Waiting ..."" Want to know who hates it? Real-life owners of the typical Americana family sit-down restaurants that the film mocks with ""Shenanigans,"" the restaurant where the film takes place. Why? Because after you see this movie, you might never want to eat at one of these places again. Not that what happens at Shenanigans happens in real restaurants per say, but if it did, I certainly wouldn't blame them.""Waiting ..."" works as a comedy because despite excessive gross-out humor, it does pretty well at containing itself and minimizing the many ways it could have become completely stupid. For instance, even if it was for budget reasons, keeping the film entirely set in the restaurant minus a few scenes prevents the story from getting far-fetched and keeps the attention on the comedic talents of its actors rather than the creativity of its script. That's what creator Rob McKittrick gets right, by far.Calling on the talents of Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris, David Koechner, Dane Cook and Luis Guzman most notably, ""Waiting ..."" delivers a quirky array of performances that will get you to laugh whether you feel good about it or not. For example, you probably won't find the fact that head waiter Monty (Reynolds) is into under-aged girls that funny, but Reynolds won't quit until he's sold you on a couple laughs. Then there's the male genital flashing game all the guys in the kitchen play. Disgusting and immature, right? But it's the camaraderie and the fun these actors have that makes it work. We also know what these restaurants are like. You don't see the classiest of people in there and frankly it must be boring and excruciating at times. It's the antics that keep everyone's sanity. Although many characters are assigned stereotypes or quirks that aren't all that original, there's still a large element of that natural interaction that keeps ""Waiting ..."" from spiraling into all out stupid.The story is not so much an overarching plot as it is assigning each character a story. The film takes place over the course of 24 hours -- a full day at Shenanigans. Everyone who works there has some conflict. Dean (Justin Long) is the college grad re-evaluating life and stuck between deciding on whether his future will involve Shenanigans. His ""girlfriend"" (Kaitlin Doubleday) deals with some nasty patrons, Calvin (Rob Benedict) has to overcome his inability to pee in a public bathroom, etc. Not deep stuff, but it keeps the film moving and provides an opportunity for laughs, which is all ""Waiting ..."" cares to serve up when all is said and done.In a decade of gross-out comedies, ""Waiting ..."" holds its own because it doesn't get out of hand. There's some stupid stuff in this movie and pointless characters, but McKittrick keeps everything simplistic, opting to give us an interesting environment for his, well, shenanigans.~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com",Waiting...
21,DarkVulcan29,"If not for Ryan Reynolds, this would be a nothing of a movie.",5,5 September 2008,"He uses the same amount of humor that carried Blade Trinity(2004), and it pretty much carries this movie also. It makes up for the punchlines that doesn't seem to work for anybody else in the film. Because nobody else seems to deliver the jokes to well, and that comes across being over the top. Especially for Anna Faris and Justin Long, who are both good at being funny, but in this film they both kind of dry up, and as they try to be funny, there really not. And lets not forget the annoying Andy Milonakis and Max Kasch who play guys who like to think there gangster rappers, but those two characters are to dumb to realize they can't rap worth a flip, and those two we're not funny at all. Ryan Reynolds manages to save this movie from oblivion, because he delivers all his jokes perfectly on the spot. And I realize he has proved himself as a dramatic actor as well, but he is also great at comedy. The other thing is that Waiting seems more like a sitcom in the works, and it probably would have been a good one, Like Scrubs(2001), but in a restaurant.

22,Polaris_DiB,Catharsis,7,9 April 2006,"A film probably best described as the Office Space for waiters past and present, Waiting is a take on the day-to-day life of the general (and generic) restaurant industry. Archetypal (and mainly caricaturistic) characters populate the staff and the customers, ranging from the slacking-off busboys to the angry coworker who's been there forever and won't get a promotion to the wonderful varieties of colorful ""guests."" Workplace woes always make for great stories, really. Who doesn't like making or listening to an after-work rant about the stupidity of guests, coworkers, management, everyone from above and below and right beside? White collar workers had their Office Space, now a friendly wave is made to what they were before they were office workers: young, sexualized people ranging from high schooler to post-college and the ... affairs they'd have with each other, socially, sexually, and dramatically.It is a tad exaggerated. I know my managers never try to be THAT friendly, but the tone of voice of that guy was amazing. And I've had (and am) the angry coworker who goes from a fake friendly help-you attitude to ready to slit anyone's throat with a blunt object in half a second, but they (and I) have never been quite as loud and vocal as the girl in this film. However, that's the point of parody, afterall, and what we're here for is catharsis. Seeing our lives shown so vividly and real, but in a humorous way that actually works out is nice because it allows us to know that ""It's so true!"" and that misanthropy can be fun (especially when revolving around the too-cool-for-school Ryan Renolds).All to relax for another half an hour after the drinking party at the end before we go to sleep to have another workday at the very same dead-end job...

The film has its fans (and was no doubt financed based on the near-universality of food-service jobs), but it gives me even less hope in the future of mankind when I see raves for such juvenile rubbish.Now hang on a second! I know what you're all thinking...that I'm a Viking come to rain fire down on your favorite film, all because I lack a sense of humor. While this is debatable, it's not that hard to be put off by ""Waiting...."" With its constant barrage of homophobic slurs, penis gags, pot jokes, and pubic hair, writer-director Rob McKittrick aims for 'crude humor' (as the MPAA descriptor would say) but somehow winds up missing the 'humor.' Being gross is one thing; making gross FUNNY is another altogether, and the sight of a guy wetting himself or a girl flashing her lint-caked bu$h amounts to zilch if shown only for its own sake.The actors do their best with the salmonella material, but the characters are underdeveloped clichés (The Awkward Guy; The Confident Stud; The New Guy; The Slut; The High-Strung Bitch, etc.), and, in all honesty, the cast as a whole (including the kid from ""Jeepers Creepers"" and Ryan Reynolds) isn't comprised of names you'd associate with highbrow entertainment in the first place.Actually, the only true entertainer within this motley crew of less-than-colorful rejects is 'seasoned' character actor Luis Guzman, as a brazenly crude Latino chef who hits the only remotely comic notes in this whole wasted enterprise.

27,Matt_Layden,"""A good chunk of the population at some point in their life has worked in the food industry""",7,11 March 2006,"In the style of CLERKS, Waiting tells the story of a group of employees at the restaurant Shennangins. Their hi-jinks, games around the kitchen and jokes that they play on the customers to make their job seem less crappy.CLERKS was a film that changed cinema, not drastically but it did make it's mark on it. Here, Waiting takes a little note from CLERKS and is able to spin its own originality on the yarn and make Waiting quite enjoyable. Granted I work in the food business which makes the film even more enjoyable. Waiting strides because of it's recognizable, but not star powered cast.A good chunk of the population at some point in their life has worked in the food industry, and the stories that they can tell could stretch for miles. In waiting what may seem outrageous to some, is quite honestly everyday happenings for others. I've never heard of the game that they play in Waiting, but wouldn't doubt it for a second.Dane Cook stands out here as Floyd, one of the cooks. The energy that he puts into the small role is outstanding. Every single character has their own fiddle, and the actor knows how to play it. Chi McBride and Luis Guzman, along with Cook really make this film. A very good casting job on the filmmakers part. Ryan Reynolds plays the same character that he did with Van Wilder. The ""I'm so cool, everyone loves me/is jealous of me"" routine. While it was okay in this film, I would have liked to see a little bit more from him.It's not so gross out as some would expect, if you idea of someone tampering with your food does gross you out, avoid this. I was surprised to see a bush shot, fake or real, it was out of nowhere. You would expect the joke to be in the film, but not to actually see it. Waiting probably the best film about the food industry.Waiting is able to connect with so many people and plays it's comedy off their misery. Crappy tippers, foreigners, friends laughing at you...you can either laugh with it and respect it, or remember the ""bad"" times and loath this film. To say that it is a rip off of CLERKS is false. If that were true, then every movie about people in a dead end job is a rip off of CLERKS. Both are ""A Day In The Life Style"" bu other then that the films are different, and both equally funny.Waiting is a film that previous food employees will find funny. If you have never worked with food, but have a sense of humour, enjoy it, don't be disgusted and afraid to ever go to a restaurant again.

28,gangstahippie,Its no Clerks but Waiting is a fairly funny film.,8,30 August 2006,"Rated R for strong crude and sexual humor,pervasive language and some drug use.I saw Waiting yesterday on the movie network.The film stars Ryan Reynolds from Van Wilder and Justin Long from that new movie Accepted.Other actors/actresses in the movie are Anna Faris and Luis Guzman.The film is like Clerks.It shows a day in the life of a waiter just like Clerks showed us the day in the life of a store clerk.THis film is definitely no Clerks.Clerks was much funnier and better but Waiting is a fairly good and funny film.There are actually quite a few plots in the film.The film is basically about a bunch of restaurant waiters and cooks and the customers they must encounter.Also the film is about a new wannabe waiter and one of the waiters must show him the ropes.Another plot in the film has one of the waiters thinking about what he wants to do with his life and his promotion that was offered to him by the manager.There are two wiggers in the film who wash dishes.They provide comic relief and are sort of like Jay and Silent Bob from clerks.Although not as funny.Waiting is a fairly funny and good film and you should see it if you like the film Clerks or Mallrats even.Runtime:94min 8/10",Waiting...

I didn't know what to say but since he offer to let me go I decided to be a good sport and go watch Waiting... in theaters in 2005. He could relate to this movie since he worked in the restaurant business before. Looking back on this movie I still remember our reaction in the theater still makes me turn away at some moments.The Film stars: Ryan Reynolds as Monty Justin Long as Dean Anna Faris as Serena David Koechner as Dan Luis Guzmán as Raddimus Chi McBride as Bishop John Francis Daley as Mitch Kaitlin Doubleday as Amy Robert Patrick Benedict as Calvin Alanna Ubach as Naomi Vanessa Lengies as Natasha Max Kasch as T-Dog Andy Milonakis as Nick Dane Cook as Floyd Jordan Ladd as Danielle Emmanuelle Chriqui as Tyla the Bartender Wendie Malick as Monty's MomEach of these characters work in the restaurant Shenaniganz. And this is where the fun begins. The film throughout is full of classic quotes some that are still being repeated even now. So despite some ordeals the writing in the film works.The humor does have some gross moments but the rest is enjoyable I still remember in theater theater how everyone laughed and it just goes to show how well it hold up. The acting in this film is real strong the entire cast help the film and their performances help make their characters convincing it's nice to see a independent movie getting a shot like this and each of the cast members really did a good job Yes there are moments that you would agree shouldn't been in the film but the film is really enjoyable and will make you laugh.I give Waiting...

33,baumer,A tribute to all servers in the world (and damn funny!),9,14 October 2005,"It's 11:27 p.m. on a Saturday night. You and your fellow closers have just worked 8 hours of one of the busiest nights in quite sometime. You're tired and your feet are sore, but there's a party at one of the waitresses homes. Everyone you know is already there and you have three minutes before you can pack up and head to the party. All the line cooks are scrubbing down the grill, the salad guys are finishing off their final duties and the dishguy is putting away the last glasses in anticipation of the night ending.And then it happens. You see the headlights. They park. They come to the door and the hostess greets them with the most deceptively charlatan like grin she possibly can. ""Are you guys still open?"" ""Yes, yes we are...."" This is one of the hilarious and unfortunately realistic scenes from the new comedy called Waiting. I have worked in the service industry for about ten years and this has happened to me ad nausea. In fact, I have it down to a science. The last customer doesn't come in at 11:15 or even 11:20. It is always 11:27. Waiting knows this and makes a mockery of it but nonetheless it is done to frustrating perfection.Written and directed by Rob McKittrick, this man obviously has experience in the service industry as every caricature that has ever worked in the industry is here. From the hot young hostess, the male gigolo waiter, the busboys who think they are gangsters, the angry waitress and some of the questionable tactics that the staff use to amuse themselves and seek retribution on the customers, it's all here. And to say this is funny is like saying that peanut butter tastes better with jam. It is a no brainer. I realize that those of us that have worked in the industry will find it funnier than those who haven't, but even if you have never waited on one customer, there is enough humour in here to entertain you at least a bit.It is obvious that McKittrick has worked in the industry. He must have or he would not have known some of the terms and many of the esoteric situations that happen behind closed doors. From the restaurant parties and romances to the absolutely asinine orientation tape we are all forced to watch, to the games, to the perfect description of the ridiculous customers, this film is funny from the first frame to the last.The plot is really secondary to the action and the antics and the hilarity. While Office Space was about as funny a movie as you could see, it did not depend on you working in an office to get some of the humour. Waiting might be a bit different, but as I said earlier, the laughs come frenetically enough in here to entertain anyone.It's fun to watch a film and relate to exactly what is happening on screen. Ryan Reynolds is pitch perfect in here and I actually know a guy who is just like him. There is so much truth in this film and it is refreshing to see someone finally tackle the issues that many of us have dealt with. One of the feel good moments in this film came from watching other servers deal with the ignorant customers who tip 5-10%. I felt their diappointment and their pain and it is a nice word of warning to would be customers, treat your server nicely.Waiting is just about as funny as Wedding Crashers and The 40 Year Old Virgin. It's too bad it won't be seen by as many people but it will have a healthy purchase rate on DVD.9/10 A smart funny comedy about those miscreants that take your order and serve you food.

34,MrGKB,Earnest auteur effort deserves a decent tip...,6,4 July 2006,"...and the one I offer to director/writer Rob McKittrick is this: remember to put at least 15% of your take-home pay into your retirement plan. I understand you're very close to the material, but that doesn't necessarily make for a good story.Essentially, ""Waiting..."" is a maybe watch-twice comedy about the restaurant business, centered on the fictional establishment of Shenaniganz, and delivered fresh and steaming to your table from the perspective of the wait staff and kitchen crew. The seemingly self-appointed leader of this motley bunch is Monty (Ryan Reynolds, whom I vaguely remember from ""Blade/Trinity""), a cynical, smug purveyor of quips and barbs and ostensible trainer of newbie, Mitch (John Francis Daley, who is less of a neophyte actor than I first suspected). Monty introduces Mitch to the rest of the gang, and I'll get to them shortly, and also clues Mitch in to ""the game,"" a running gag throughout the film that is so absurd that by film's end is entirely believable, though still ridiculous.""Waiting..."" is fairly thoroughly sophomoric and juvenile and whatever other adjectives you might care to come up with to indicate the lower brow excesses of humor. Still, there's something about it that is appealing, though perhaps only to those of us who have worked in the food services industry. The ensemble characters (beyond Monty and Mitch) include Serena (Anna Faris, who will hopefully someday complete the break from her ""Scary Movie"" stereotype, which she does to some degree here), Dean (Justin Long, of ""Jeepers Creepers"" and ""Dodgeball"" fame and a debut in ""Galaxy Quest"" that never registered on my memory screen), Dan the manager (the always reliable comedian/character actor, David Koechner), Raddimus the cook (the equally reliable and funny Luis Guzmán), Amy (an as yet ""unknown"" Kaitlin Doubleday), Calvin the shy micturator (Robert Patrick Benedict, a regular on TV's ""Threshhold""), Naomi (a wonderfully-realized neurotic trashtalker played by Alanna Ubach, who in another life I would die for), Natasha the underage hostess (Vanessa Lengies, an up-and-comer who shows great promise), Bishop the kitchen sage (Chi McBride, very dry and funny), and Nick and Floyd, two wigger busboys with delusions of gangsta-hood (Andy Milonakis and Dane Cook). Virtually all of these characters are stereotypes with very little depth, whose purpose is to enable one-liners and set up sight gags.Still, there's something appealing about the whole thing in ensemble that's hard to put a finger on, enough to keep me from rating it lower, anyway. Maybe it's because the humor is aimed at a very specific demographic, maybe not. I point with great obviousness at the demographic breakdown of IMDb voters; the older they are, the less they liked ""Waiting..."" Who knows, maybe it's just guilt on their part from being lousy tippers. Ancient old me, I laughed out loud a few times, and smiled a lot, and only paused the DVD a few times to go smoke a cigarette or get a drink. Not bad for a ""Clerks""-wannabe comedy.The major fault of the story, I think, is the overabundance of characters. Cutting a few of them out would have allowed a tighter focus on what little conflict/drama there is in the cupboard-is-bare plot. I realize that McKittrick wanted to populate his restaurant with a full complement of workers, but in the end, it wasn't necessary, rendering the laughs very hit and miss. A similar mistake was made by Terrance McNally when he adapted his play ""Frankie & Johnnie in the Claire de Lune"" to the screen. It felt like every actor lobbied McKittrick to expand their part and he obliged them all. Next time out, Rob, please keep things simpler. You have talent; time now to bring it under control. I look forward to your next serving, and promise to tip accordingly.",Waiting...
35,FieCrier,waiting for the laughs in this comedy,2,19 February 2006,"A friend told me if I saw this movie, I'd wet my pants laughing. Well, like one of the characters in the film, I couldn't urinate if I tried.It does have some good camera-work, with the camera smoothly navigating a restaurant floor crowded with tables and people. At the end, the brick-a-brack decorating the walls of the restaurant is shown to be a Rube Goldberg device. Some of the actors do a decent job with little material, like Chi McBride, and I'd like to see some of the others in another movie.I get the movie; I've been there, some of those things happen. In the 1990s I worked at about six different restaurants, from fast food to upscale restaurant & bar. Some of them were so bad as jobs I had to walk out on them; I definitely sympathize with cooks and waitstaff.Plenty of funny things happened at the restaurants I worked at, so I certainly thought there was a lot of potential for humor, but I just didn't find the movie funny at all, unfortunately.There's absolutely something to be said for restaurants where the chef prepares your food right at your table, or those with open kitchens, or at the very least those with an open doorway to the kitchen. Those that hide the kitchen behind walls and a closed door might treat the food just as well as those that don't, but you never know.",Waiting...

Monty (Ryan Reynolds) and the rest of the star-studded Shenanigan's cast show us around this underrepresented world.This movie is raunchy and homophobic. The jokes are dated and cheap.

38,DarthVoorhees,It takes a whole other meaning if you lived the scenario...,9,27 May 2009,"Waiting is probably the best of the comedies to come out of this recent renaissance of Judd Apatow type humor. Like Seinfeld or Clerks if you will ,the picture is simplicity it's self. Open to close at a franchise restaurant called ShenaniganZ with all the eccentricities along the way. It's no real secret that few who work at a restaurant or franchise corporation like their job. The fact is it's the only labor that the non degree carrying person can find. There's all ways a sense of frustration for the job and to not make it a prison, one needs to ""spice"" things up. Waiting's humor is inspired entirely by that notion of spicing things up.It's no secret that Waiting is a cult film which is able to develop a kinship with those who have lived through their own ""Shenaniganz"". I myself have not worked at a restaurant like ""Shenaniganz"", but I feel the cult appeal of the film spreads to people who have worked at any Big Box or Franchise business. I have worked for a Big Box retailer and all of Waiting applies to my job. I laughed with Waiting because the notion of the customer all ways being right tests the patientence of someone working for minimum wage.Waiting's humor is mainly observational about the surroundings. We don't get to know many of the characters very well aside from Monty and Dean. Monty played by Ryan Renyolds, in his funniest performance, is the typical personality of the scenario. The character himself isn't very likable but we love him simply because he does what we wanted to do in these scenarios but didn't have the guts to do. The role was tailor made for Reynolds and I can't imagine anyone else doing it justice. Monty represents the guy who may hate his job but loves the fact he is suave and cool to his coworkers. Without Shenaniganz Monty is a pig and a loser. We know for a fact that he is only as good as his lies about his sexual exploits. And yet he is the center point of every scene. Waiting is Monty's movie despite the fact that it isn't written around him. He is a perfect character for this type of film. We think Monty is cool and funny because Renoylds knows what this character is. Some have criticized Renoylds' comedic performances, I however think he is brilliant. Monty needs Renoylds because without him he's a giant jerk. Renyolds's comedic timing and energy make this one of the great comedic performances in this new millennium.Justin Long is Dean the most level headed of the ensemble. Dean is at a crossroads in his life, he wants more but he feels chained to ShenaniganZ. Waiting needs a character like Dean for it to succeed. It would be easy to make a film about goof balls in a kitchen, but Dean is what makes the film not only hilarious but very poignant as well. Part of what makes Dean funny is the dilemma he is in. His boss Dan has offered him a promotion to Assistant Manager of the restaurant. Dan is a loser with a capital L. His life revolves around ShenaniganZ and it's philosophies. David Koechner could be one of the best things this movie has going for it. Maybe it's an inside thing but I found Dan to be absolutely hilarious partially because I have had a boss exactly like him. Dan believes in ShenaniganZ as if it is more than a job. He is motivated by just being there while the employees look as if they have been pulled out of bed. I think the scene I laughed the most at was Dan's opening speech to the crew. He thinks the Shenaniganz corporate catch phrases will motivate the crew to give a ""little extra"" Monty's response had me in stitches. The dilemma is a very valid one, does Dean want to become Dan? Waiting is a big inside joke for some. I think you are able to appreciate the film if you didn;t live through your own personal ""ShenaniganZ"", but the film becomes gut bustlingly funny if you did. If you have worked in this type of area than Waiting is a must see. If not I wouldn't wish working at a ""ShenaniganZ"" on anyone...",Waiting...

40,Horror-yo,"Funny, Genuine, Snappy, Relentless and surprisingly SPECIAL",9,22 May 2016,"This is a comedy that sets one tone immediately, and stays true to its motto throughout while consistently delivering the humor from start to finish: from the first seconds, to the very last bit of footage, even during the credits. It's very silly, but if one would just go along and enjoy the ride as a whole, surely there's some good to be found and not just in patches but throughout the whole picture. At least a few characters will make you laugh just for who they are, and as a gang there at the Shenanigans restaurant, they're quite a troop of awful fiends. The interesting thing here is the main plot is actually completely camouflaged into the various and constant developments in the story; mostly insignificant but hilariously at that; and it only comes out clear and unleashes with a fury divine at the very end, and serves as almost a sort of twist on the entire movie itself like a meta-thing, like the movie craps on itself. The film does an amazing job where every single scene is a genuine gag and none of the scenes drag on the plot, while conducting the essential development of the story all the while.All in all, there's a special feel to this film, it is surely NOT like its ""neighbors"" however similar to them it may look on the outside. Lots of good laughs, tons of diverse funnily written characters each with a comedic angle, a few life lessons (the ""you probably need this more than I do"", right back atcha moment) - and it brews a sort of a casual, cosy feeling, like we know those Shenanigans idiots for real. A good, funny, easy comedy that you might find becomes a personal favorite. It grows on you. It's a compact unit with no filler, and lots of work was put into it, the film makers knew what they were doing. The rap in the credits is hilarious and more proof the crew had a real thing going onset during filming. Most importantly, it doesn't feel like a manufactured by-the-numbers Hollywood comedy.

'Waiting...' is funny at parts, but most of the time it drags indescribably and there are so many lines and scenes that are meant to be funny that just didn't win me over. It's a very average yuck comedy in the fashion of 'Road Trip' and 'American Pie', but it's a hell of a lot more raunchier. It may just be the most disgusting movie of the year, but it sure as hell isn't the funniest.'Waiting...' follows the lives of very f*cked-up individuals working at a 'T.G.I. Friday's' sort of restaurant. It takes place during the course of one day, Mitch's (John Francis Daley) first day working their and he is mentored by the coolest guy who works there - Van Wilder, oops, I mean, Monty (Ryan Reynolds). During Mitch's first day he encounters the creepy loser manager, Dan (David Koechner), a struggling waiter who has aspirations of a greater job, Dean (Justin Long), Dean's sweet girlfriend who is one of the waitresses (Jordan Ladd), a wild loose kind of waitress (Anna Farris), a chain-smoking foul-mouthed senior waitress who hates everyone (Alanna Ulbach), a geeky waiter who has bad luck with girls and public urination (Robert Patrick Benedict), two clueless potheads who think they are black (Max Kasch and MTV's Andy Milonakis), a quiet but super-cool head chef (Chi McBride), a crazy and raunchy young chef (the ultra-hilarious Dane Cook) and an absolutely insane chef who invented a game where he tries to show people his genitals (Luis Guzman of course). It's one screwed-up, raunchy and semi-funny day.The cast of 'Waiting...' is mildly funny to say the most, with the exception of a hysterical performance by Luis Guzman that saves the movie from the depths of tediousness. There are a lot of funny people in this (Skyler Stone, Andy Milonakis, Ryan Reynolds, Alanna Ulbach, Anna Farris, and especially, Dane Cook) but they don't get a chance to shine at all, and a lot of their dialogue is flat-out terrible. I think perhaps the writer/director was aiming for something a hell of a lot funnier than this. If you like raunchy humor just for the sake of being absolutely disgusting and not terribly funny, you'll love a movie like 'Waiting...'. It has some laughs, and very few hard belly laughs, but for the most part it's as bland as most diner food.

46,HelenMary,don't see the point 24hr in an American-style restaurant,4,7 June 2013,"Not even Ryan Reynolds' humorous delivery could save this yawn fest. It was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't even ""black comedy"" neither did it have much to keep the viewer interested. Set in ""Shenanigans"" a typical American style restaurant, it covers 24hrs and the induction tour of the facility and training of one new member of staff. Monty (Reynolds) is responsible for the tour and fills the newbie in on all the silly goings on in the restaurant (mainly centered around a game the male staff play where they show each other their genitalia).As a film it is trying to say something about existential dilemmas of young people with more potential than their current lives offer them, but unfortunately I didn't care about any of the characters, and everyone was rather ridiculous. Dean (Justin Long) was the only vaguely sensible character, and the only character played in a real and recognisably genuine way but it all seemed fatuous and pointless. Whilst I didn't warm to any of the characters, nor the premise of the film, the actors were committed to their characters and the film itself was good in terms of dialogue and production, despite my not enjoying it. I can see how many people would consider it better than I did.There were amusing parts, but nothing laugh out loud for me, and I felt it would probably appeal more to student-stoner-male humour as many of the potential laughs were genital-based, so certainly not something for everyone. Many of the characters were horrible, but it did highlight how NOT to be in a restaurant. There was one despicable character (a woman diner) who you were pleased was treated to ""extras"" on her meal... remember to be nice to your wait-staff as they handle your food!",Waiting...
47,nobbytatoes,painfully funny,9,12 December 2005,"The people at Shenanigan's restaurant are an old mix of characters, never making their jobs boring by the amount of shenanigans of their own. Mitch is just starting and is taking the tour with Monty. Monty is the friendly yet crazy work mate, making every moment at fun one. Dean has hit a rut and questions why he still works at Shenanigan's, and cant commit with a fellow employee Amy. Dean was also asked if he wanted the assistant manager spot; to much of the content of others. Serena and Monty were dating, but they have a friendship on fake smiles and sarcasms.The odd mix of characters of waiting make this such a wonderful. It's just not focused upon the three main characters; Monty, Dean and Serena, the background characters have their own personalities and dilemmas, adding so much more story. The development of the characters aren't fully developed, but you can still understand and sympathies to their problems. The characters are clichéd; you have seen a lot of them before; but they are so well placed and interact perfectly; there is a realism to them.The major point of Waiting is the black humor that runs through it. It doesn't work off big set pieces and outlandish situations to make you laugh, the humor organically comes out of the characters from their dialog. A lot of the dialog is perverse, but it never seems out of place. Waiting does perfectly reflect the relationship between customer and waiter; well i did. Rob McKittrick unashamedly shows this interaction; the smart-ass customer who always complains, the regulars, and what could go behind the walls when the customers push to hard.Ryan Reynolds brings another eccentric performance forward. He had been stuck with that eccentric ego in a lot of movies; but he does it perfectly and does another great job again. Anna Faris had finally lost that ditsy persona and shows a broader range of acting; bringing a great performance. Justin Long does have a puppy dog face a lot of the time, but really comes forward in the more serious moments. All the other actors as the employees all do wonderful performances, making the background character more interesting.Waiting is a great black comedy on hospitality that is so painfully funny.",Waiting...
48,Greatornot,I would rather be WAITING to have root canal.,1,6 July 2007,"This movie was an absolute disaster. Horrible pranks that lasted the entire movie. The typical stereotypes of characters. So much could have been done to make this an intelligent movie in this particular genre. Unfortunately, the writers decided to go 180 on that. Unless they were just not ""smart"" enough with the creative license to even consider to go down that avenue. I tend to believe the latter was the case , sadly. To get a better feel about the restaurant industry may I suggest Empire Falls, which has a plot not related to restaurant industry but, actually, does more to portray the restaurant industry than this piece of garbage. The one redeeming feature is Alana Ulbach , who played Naomi, the psycho b***h , that would carry on in the kitchen or out of customers way and quickly turn on the smile and charm when customers could see her. I thought that was great and realistic. Otherwise, I suggest to avoid this movie and spend time getting a root canal or watching THE FOOD NETWORK.",Waiting...
49,squirrel_burst,"Too gross too often, but it also speaks to teens working at restaurants",7,31 March 2015,"""Waiting..."" is a disturbingly accurate reflection of the life of a restaurant crew aimlessly working their way through the daily routine and entertaining themselves with their puzzling in-jokes and communal resentments. The movie is an exaggeration of what goes on behind the scenes but It's really not that far off. It's not so much that the characters or events in the movie are made-up as much as you would probably have to pool together the craziest stories and characters from 5 different restaurants to get the ones featured here. Having worked in a couple of restaurants operated mostly by teenagers and young adults, I can tell you that I experienced some stunts that were almost as insane as the ones pulled here. I'm even ashamed to say that I recognize some of the characters in the film as being some of my own co-workers from when I was in high school. What doesn't work is the gross-out humour. When it's over-the-top ridiculous it's funny, but when it's realistic and food related, it's just foul and will make you want to turn the movie off in disgust (and certainly if you're eating, you're appetite will vanish quickly). If you can get past the unappetizing portions of the picture and if you've ever worked at a job that in retrospect you really hated, you're bound to laugh hard at this comedy.

50,MovieAlien,Don't leave any tips for this service,2,15 October 2007,"Lions Gate Entertainment are something of an oddity. Formerly ""Artisan Entertainment"", the company is known for distributing 2 kinds of cinema: Films by well-known ""Indy"" directors, or B-grade Hollywood fodder that the larger studios turned down because of financial risk.""Waiting"" strangely doesn't fall in either category.Supposedly based on a true experience, this misfire follows employee exploits at a casual dining establishment from the lunch to dinner hour. These characters don't like their jobs or the customers, and each one has their own way expressing it - either by contaminating a patron's food, insulting a patron, playing a bizarre exhibitionist game in the kitchen or using vulgarity in every sentence. Oh yeah, there are also two employees who dream about setting their manager on fire. Considering they don't do anything on the job but talk trash and steal whipped cream, I wouldn't be surprised if their boss felt the same way about them.Humor has to be unpredictable to be funny. Even the ""gross out""-kind has fair competition. Look at John Belushi in ""Animal House"". Pluto belched, spat mashed potatoes on people and urinated on someone's shoes, among other things. But the late SNL star had something future ""Lampoon"" actor/writers do not - comic timing. In fact, 'Waiting' is not so different from the recent NL movies. If there was a fair share of female nudity, ""National Lampoon's Night At The Diner"" would be a more apt title for this winner.At one point in life I had worked at a restaurant, but never saw antics like those portrayed in the movie. Rude customers were laughed off after they left, and there were only 1-2 employees who didn't wash their hands before handling the food. But it was out of laziness, not vindication. Perhaps this ""depiction"" will ring true for some, but the movie is so repetitive, so juvenile and so predictable that even the most disgruntled food service worker will be bored to tears.

51,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"""Waiting..."" for the laughs and classic hilarity to end...hoping it won't",9,2 November 2005,"Before I saw this film, I had been waiting on ""Waiting..."" (lol) to come out because of one name that stood out to me: Dane Cook. I'm a huge Dane Cook fan, and was simply ecstatic to see him in a film. But don't worry, because this movie is more than Dane Cook. You'll be surprised to see everyone's favorite funny man Ryan Reynolds, ""Scary Movie"" star Anna Faris, ""Dodgeball"" star Justin Long, Dane Cook, the hilarious Luis Guzman, and everyone's favorite idiot, Andy Milonakis. Director Rob McKittrick's first movie is a winner, and here's why.The plot centers around the lives of the employees of Shenanigans restaurant (which, by the way, is not real). Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is the hunky man in his 20's who has a thing for high school girls, like the hostess Natasha (Vanessa Lengies). Naomi (Allana Ubach) is the always angry waitress that needs to get out more, Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict) is the nice man waiter who has a ""problem."" Dean (Justin Long) is the community college student who once was an honors high school student, and Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday) is Dean's...well you could say she's his girlfriend. Serena (Anna Faris) is another waitress, and Monty's beautiful ex-girlfriend, and the group is headed by Dan (David Koechner), the restaurant's delusional manager. The kitchen staff is the hi-light of the film, with Floyd (Dane Cook) the hilarious and energetic cook, Bishop (Chi McBride) the dishwasher/philosophizer, and Raddimus (Luis Guzman) the always horny cook. There are also two teen slackers, Nick and T-Dog (Andy Milonakis and Max Kasch) who are the busboys of the restaurant and the resident wannabe gangsters. Oh yeah, and they're white. They are simply hilarious.The film starts out in Dean's house, where a huge party is happening for all of Shenanigans' employees. We meet all the characters the next day at work. Dan enters with a lost looking young man named Mitch (John Francis Daley), and we meet Monty again, who will train Mitch in the ""ways"" of Shenanigans, which include a game amongst the men that involves their ""gifts"" (go see the film to see the prank, it's hilarious). The funny thing about Mitch is that no one ever lets him finish a sentence, which mounts to by far the funniest part at the end of the movie. We continue to meet the characters and learn about them and their hilarious persona. We see everything that goes with restaurants, from rival businesses, pranks, bantering fellow employees, and of course, food tampering, which of course is led by Floyd. The movie does have its perverted and mildly disgusting moments, but they are made in such a way that it's very funny. All the actors play their roles perfectly, especially Ryan Reynolds, Luis Guzman, and Dane Cook. If you want to see more of these actors, Reynolds and Anna Faris both star in another movie due this year, called ""Just Friends,"" while Dane Cook stars with Chris Evans and Jessica Biel in a movie called ""London,"" due in 2006. Ryan Reynolds is also in ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder."" You can catch Justin Long in ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,"" starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, and ""Herbie: Fully Loaded,"" alongside Lindsay Lohan.With countless memorable lines and events, and lovable characters, teamed with a great plot and original humor, ""Waiting..."" is an instant cult classic for the ages.

52,Dunham16,a remake of a classic theme about employees of a business,7,1 March 2017,The theme is employees of a business put up with behind the scenes problems and nuisances but if needing the job somehow pull through and continue to collect their pay. The hit Hollywood movie IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME 1949 and the hit British situation comedy ARE YOU BEING SERVED 1975 through 1975-82 are prime examples of this genre at its finest. WAITING 2005 is a Hollywood comedy which fictionalizes the problems behind the scenes of employees at a chain restaurant which for some reason is visualized by the photographer and editor as resembling many branches of the real Applebees chain. The movie focus on crude humor melded to public male nudity. What seems fascinating is the prediction in this well made and edited film of the general historic failure to soon follow of branches of chain restaurants as more and more emigres to American urban centers in which chain restaurants often focus their branches recently relocated from more rural areas of low population density. If not in fact today frankly preferring takeout when this is a local option they otherwise prefer the food court in which the customers line up at the counter of the particular takeout they prefer at that hour to be invited if they prefer to consume their meal at tables within the facility but not managed by the counter staff at which they order their food.In retrospect this level of chain restaurant branch which once flourished in neighborhoods in which the local patrons preferred to regularly visit these establishments for regular meals is today on the way out on the American landscape.,Waiting...
53,ScottDMenzel,I'am still Waiting to laugh,1,11 October 2005,"When I first read about ""Waiting"" a few months ago, I kind of wanted to see the film because it sounded pretty interesting plus it starred Justin Long who usually is very good and Anna Faris who although always plays the same character in every movie is still pretty likable. Anyway, about a month or so ago I saw the trailer for the film and it completely turned me off. I went on my usual movie site IMDb.com and stated that the trailer looked like crap. This is when the director Rob McKittrick told me to watch the film before I commented on it, so I wrote the director back telling him that I promised not to say anything else about the film until I saw it. So today, Tuesday October 11, 2005 I went to my local multiplex and watched ""Waiting"" ""Waiting"" is about the workers at a restaurant called Shenanigan's. The film shows life in a restaurant along with the friendships made and the pranks that go on behind the scenes. The restaurants ringleader is Monty (Ryan Reynolds) who is a cocky, sarcastic, a**hole who is assigned the duty of training the newbie Mitch (John Francis Daley). As Mitch's training goes on he learns all the pranks that go on at Shenanigan's including the rules to the notorious game which is played at this restaurant. Laughs are suppose to ensue Walking into the theater earlier today, I felt hopeful that the movie will at least make me laugh. About 30 minutes into the movie, I didn't laugh once and just started looking around the empty theater. As the movie continued on for its 93 minutes running time, I still didn't laugh, not even once. I understand comedy is subjective and I totally understand that but even in comedies I don't normally enjoy, I still get a chuckle or two out of the film. This movie did not make me laugh or chuckle once; I just sat there as the title suggests ""waiting"" to laugh. This film's jokes are all done before and are for immature people to laugh at. I mean for anyone who is actually mature will not like the jokes in the film. Even the whole putting things in your food joke was used before in films like ""Road Trip."" The so called jokes in this film are not funny and there isn't a fresh joke in the sight during the entire films running time.I really don't understand how Ryan Reynolds still gets work. I mean I know it has to be because of his looks because he tends to play the same character over and over again in every movie, you know the cocky, sarcastic, womanizing goof-ball. And every time I see Mr. Reynolds on screen, I feel bad for not liking him but honestly he's not the least bit amusing to me. I have never seen such an actor play a one-dimensional character all the time. His character in this film is not likable; it's just overly cocky and annoying. Justin Long really disappoints me in this film and he is extremely wasted as a character that is confused about what he is going to do with his life. Dane Cook who I heard is suppose to be one funny guy is underused and pretty much wasted as well in this film. Anna Faris plays her normal Anna Faris role but actually seems to have a little more intelligence here. Luis Guzman is also a real waste as the main cook who seems to have obsessions with both showing his penis and getting sex from his girlfriend. His character gets very annoying very quickly.This movie runs on two gags, the so called game that the male workers play and the whole lets drop people's food on the floor or do disgusting things to there food gag and honestly neither work. You feel as though the script is very poorly written and almost wonder how the hell someone read this thing and approved it for a feature film. The script contained enough f-bombs to compete with the film ""Scarface"" and the movie loved to use the word cock and penis like the movie was intended for a bunch of 10-13 year olds who giggle whenever someone says one of those words. The movie is rather pointless with no real plot and is extremely poorly written with one-dimensional characters.Bottom line, this is without a doubt the worst film of the year. I didn't laugh once in this film, I didn't like any of the characters, there was no point, and lastly there were no redeeming qualities at all. This movie was made for immature people who think that fart jokes and crude sex gags are still funny. The movie contains recycled jokes and one-dimensional characters. And while the director Rob McKittrick seems like a pretty down to earth guy, I really don't understand how he got this film made. And his biggest gag of all though is that he actually tricked me into seeing this flick and giving him my $6.00 and an hour and a half of my time. But in the end, the negative reviews for this film are not a lie and the film deserves every one of them. I totally agree with the Variety reviewer Dennis Harvey who states in his review ""The wait for laughs lasts the entire length of Waiting"" because this truly is a very unfunny and unoriginal film.MovieManMenzel's final rating for this sad excuse of a movie is a 1/10. Check to see what other movies are playing and if nothing else is playing, well go home and stare at the wall, it's just as amusing.",Waiting...
54,TheMovieMark,A disturbing satire of what might happen behind-the-scenes at restaurants ensues.,5,7 October 2005,"Have you ever snapped your fingers at a member of the wait staff because he or she didn't bring you a refill fast enough? Ever rudely complained that your steak wasn't 100% perfect and accused your waiter of stupidity because of this? If so, then Waiting... will put a lump in your throat at the thought of what you've probably ingested over the years (thanks to backstage kitchen hijinks) at public restaurants and make you think twice before being rude again. The smile plastered on your waitress' face may not be as sincere as you think, and the gravy on your mashed potatoes may contain some ingredients that you absolutely do not want to know about.Working as both over-the-top satire and a disturbing public service announcement, Waiting... is a sporadically hilarious, overly disgusting film that explores the trials and tribulations of a group of restaurant employees all while concentrating a little too heavily on the raunch.You see, a ""gross-out comedy"" is referred to as such for a specific reason - it is designed to gross out the viewer. Gross him out of what? That I'm not so sure about. However, what I am sure about is that I prefer to laugh consistently through a comedy rather than worry about the next scene that's going to force me to turn away from the screen in disgust.Those viewers who find themselves unable to control their laughter at tasteless games where employees try to force other employees to look at their genitals might consider this to be just their style. However, I've decided that one thing I really don't need nor want to see is male genitalia. Games like this may very well go on, but that doesn't make me any more interested in watching 'em. It just makes me thankful that I never worked at a restaurant.The fact that this game continues throughout the entire movie makes the anticipation of what you fear you might see almost as bad as the sight itself once it finally does arrive. ""Well, I really didn't need to see that,"" were the only words that came to me. And if you're easily offended by vulgar, sex-driven humor then you might find yourself thinking the same thing about Waiting... Surprisingly enough, this is not even the nastiest example.Giving The 40-Year Old Virgin a very strong run for its money as the raunchiest film of the year (and probably beating it), Waiting... definitely reminded me of the importance of being nice to your waiter/waitress though. I shudder to think some of that stuff actually might go on in a restaurant's kitchen - very disturbing!

The entire premise of people behaving like this is fake, false u name it, nobody behaves like this in a restaurant or else they get fired. Simple as that. And the amount of hot babes working there, huh, unless it is Hooters or another restaurant of that kind no chance in hell several top class babes would work in a lousy joint like that.

From the start, it's obvious which famous chain of restaurants the in-movie establishment known as ""Shenanigans"" parodies. Fun fact: This is the same restaurant referenced in Broken Lizard's film, ""Super Troopers"".The humor is crude, offensive, and extremely juvenile but it gets some good laughs despite the fact that some of the dialogue can be long and boring (note a particular exchange about sex and relationships between Anna Faris and Ryan Reynolds), and some of Dean's ""woe is me"" sub-plot dialogue can cause you to roll your eyes and groan.....but again, overall it provides good laughs, though STRICTLY for the adults in the room.

58,oshram-3,"Funny, funny movie",7,9 October 2006,"Waiting is a day-in-the-life story of a group of maladroits who work at a restaurant named ShenaniganZ (it's a TGIF/Applebees/etc. hybrid). The irreverent crew is led by Monty (Ryan Reynolds) the resident smart-ass who has a one-liner for every situation. Arguably the main character is Dean (Justin Long), who is at least the least morally reprehensible of the bunch. There's also Raddimus (Luiz Guzman), a cook who invented the game 'show your balls' (more later), as well as a motley assortment of supporting characters: the closet philosopher, the angry, angry waitress, the flirty waitress, the surly, gross cooks, the underage hostess, and, of course, the stuffy, self important manager (a cliché you would have to expect from this set-up).Waiting couches its tale of debauchery with the narrative thread that it's the first day for new trainee Mitch (John Francis Daley), who never gets to say a word the whole day because people are too busy commenting on the place to allow him to speak. We see that almost every employee pretty much hates the restaurant (which felt very realistic to me, especially for a gross comedy), yet they revel in one another's company even while attempting to set one another up. For most of the guys, this revolves around a game where you try to trick the other males in the restaurant into looking at your exposed genitalia. This sounds particularly juvenile and gross, and yet writer/director Rob McKittrick manages to get a number of genuine belly laughs out of such an absurd and grotesque game It helps that Guzman, Reynolds, and the rest of the boys in the kitchen play their roles with such gusto, as if it really were the most important thing in their day to expose themselves to the others (and with this crew, it actually is).Of course we also have Dean's dilemma of not doing anything with his life, the lone standout in the den of amorality. Long has established a likable presence in the course of several films (if co-starring in a Britney Spears movie didn't kill his career, he's sure to make it, I think) and he plays off that here to good effect. Though Reynolds mostly steals the show because he gets the best lines (and everyone loves a smart-ass), nonetheless it's Dean who is the core of the film.There are a lot of gross gags in this film (one was so bad I actually gagged watching it), so be warned, and the humor is exceedingly blue. But the movie is surprisingly sharp and funny, and there's a joke at the end which is hilarious; it's been building for the whole film and yet you never realize it until it's revealed. Waiting is far from a perfect film  it runs a little too long, and some of the characters at times veer into cartoon territory, but it's also a very funny movie with more than a few running threads that pay off several times. It's certainly worth a viewing if you can stand the ribald subject matter.",Waiting...

60,highwaytourist,Overkill,5,28 July 2007,"It's a great idea and a worthy subject. Many restaurant customers have wondered in passing what things were like away from the tables. The goal was to give audiences a vision of what life is like for the waiters and kitchen help at an Applebees/Bob Evans type of restaurant. And at times, it does succeed. There is a message in this movie, which is summed up in the line, ""Don't mess with the people who handle your food."" There is one really big problem, however. The film just tries too hard. It spends more time being vulgar than being clever and topical. While I'm not a prude, hearing the F-word every five minutes really gets old. And while there are undoubtedly rude customers who deserve the waiters' contempt, the things that are done to some of them (through their food) are not only disgusting, but probably illegal. Having watched slasher films in the past, I'm not that squeamish, but there are scenes which really made me flinch, and not in a good way. Also tedious is Ryan Reynolds, who overplays his role as badly as the film overplays the toilet humor. During every scene, he tries so hard to upstage the rest of the cast, it's as though he regards them as competitors rather than co-stars. Justin Long gives the best performance in the show, about a veteran waiter who fears that life is passing him by. He looks to have a bright future in show business, and he proves again that he has the talent for it.There are moments which really work, but not enough of them.

63,samseescinema,consistently funny gross-out gags are sure to satisfy the same audiences that loved the Crashers and the Virgin,7,10 October 2005,"Waiting reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com rating: 3 out of 4Director: Robert McKittrick Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Justin Long, Chi McBride, Anna Faris, Dane Cook Screenplay: Robert McKittrick MPAA Classification: R (strong and crude sexual humor, pervasive language and some drug use)2005 has, as of yet, been dubbed as the year for comedy's comeback. With two hugely popular comedies (Wedding Crashers and 40 Year Old Virgin) pooling tickets sales much past the $100 million mark at the box office, Lions Gate Productions' new entry, Waiting, couldn't have hoped for a better crowd for their film to leap into. Thankfully, Waiting continues 2005's tradition of quality comedy. It's certainly not as good as the other broad comedies lauded this year, but its low, low, low brow humor and consistently funny gross-out gags are sure to satisfy the same audiences that loved the Crashers and the Virgin.The film takes place over the course of one day, following the lives of the waiters, cooks, and manager of the family restaurant chain Shenanigans (in a nice nod to Sooper Troopers). Heading up the cast is Justin Long playing Dean, whose day's taken a nosedive since his mother mentioned, once again, the success stories of his former high school classmates. Dean's story actually plays as Waiting's backbone story, focusing on his dismay at the prospect of becoming assistant manager at Shenanigans and wasting his life away waiting tables. But, really, most of Waiting's laughs lie in the crazy antics of the rest of the cast. First time director/writer Robert McKittrick, wrote the screenplay to work as a kind of oddball ensemble film, where we flit about the restaurant's many characters and their insane issues. Connecting most of the characters, however, is the game they all love to play, quaintly titled ""The Penis Showing Game."" And, yes, the game plays exactly like it sounds. We learn the game and its many strategies through Monty's tour of Shenanigans as he trains, Mitch (John Daley), the new guy. It's especially popular among the cooks (fans of stand-up will notice Dane Cook playing Floyd, one of the cook's), who suggest to Mitch that, in his free time at the restaurant, he should play with himself and come up with new ways to win the aptly-titled game. Admittedly, this sort of humor is why Waiting never rises to the level of 40 Year Old Virgin. It's funny in its persistent repetition and comedic timing, but, at the same time, so low-brow that it loses taste and quickly becomes immature. Director McKittrick succeeds in that he smartly captures the bizarre camaraderie between co-workers at temporary jobs. Having worked for nearly a year in a similarly depressing job as the characters in Waiting (I'm a lowly part-time cashier at Target), I, and surely many other teenagers, can relate to the oddball relationships of these waiters. The film seems to have been written from first-hand experience; as if McKittrick quit his job, went to film school, and wrote Waiting. These characters actually function more as caricatures, but the basis for every one of them comes from the real-life workplace. The final scene is set at a party, and as the last line is read and the credit for Unit Production Manager is superimposed, every member of the audience sit comfortably in their seat, content to watching the characters party. That's when you know the film works: when we wouldn't mind sticking around for a couple hours more, hanging out with the people on screen. And although Waiting may pull some unnecessary jokes and cross the line into boring immaturity at times, it has enough bizarre truths and likable characters to make it worth of a Saturday evening at the multiplex. -www.samseescinema.com",Waiting...
64,leilapostgrad,Austin Movie Show review,10,12 October 2005,"I hated (HATED!) being a waitress, but this movie is so hilarious and so ballsy that it almost makes me want to go back to the summer of 1999 to work one more shift at TGI Fridays. Waiting is the best, most accurate, most honest, and most riotously funny movie ever made about the service industry. Here's how I see it  the world is divided into two groups of people: those who have waited tables and those who haven't. Those who have never worked a day of their lives in a restaurant may find this movie amusing, but they'll think it's too absurd to be real, and they'll probably never give a second thought to this movie ever again.But those of you who have felt the pain, degradation, and humiliation of waiting tables will p**s your pants laughing at how PERFECT this movie is. First-time writer/director Rob McKittrick has created a dead-on depiction of 24 hours in the restaurant biz. The movie opens at a late-night party with lots of underage drinking, smoking, and sex. Then we see the wait staff hung-over at work the next day. The restaurant they all work at is called ""Shenanigans,"" but it looks an awful lot like the TGI Fridays I worked at.All the characters in Waiting are based on the real people who work in every restaurant. There's the hot/slutty/underage hostess, the fat and ugly cook who somehow dates a really hot waitress, the stoner/punk bust boy, and the manager with the chip on his shoulder. All the customers in this film (the cheap red necks who don't know how to tip, the b****y women, the drunk and horny men) are all customers I've waited on. And no filmmaker has ever so accurately portrayed the complex and irreconcilable tension between the wait staff and kitchen staff.But at the end of the night, no matter what drama unfolds, no matter what dishes brake, and no matter how much money you make in tips (or don't make), everyone gets wasted and parties together, and you all know you're in it together. Waiting simply tells a story about a profession that most people never give a second thought to. But it tells that story flawlessly. Can't wait for the DVD.",Waiting...
65,Movieguy_blogs_com,"What this movie lacked in a budget, it more than makes up for in laughs.",10,2 November 2005,"In 'Waiting' Ryan Reynolds plays Monty, the seemingly head waiter at a Shenanigan's restaurant. Monty hates his job, like most, but he is like a god at Shenanigan's and gets away with almost anything. His bud and roommate Dean (Justin Long) is just a little more dissatisfied, but starts to see things in perspective once he is offered an assistant manager position.This movie really is not that deep. In point of fact, it is hilarious. I loved this film, but I cannot recommend it to everyone. It is full of very crude humor (just the kind I like). If you combined 'Clerks' with 'Van Wilder' you would have 'Waiting'. Ryan Reynolds plays a very similar character to 'Van Wilder', only much more vulgar. Both Luis Guzmán (Raddimus) and Chi McBride (Bishop) are terrific in their respected roles.I did notice that the cinematography in this seemed poor, making it look like a cheap film. But who cares? What this movie lacked in a budget, it more than makes up for in laughs. Unless you are easily offended, go see this movie.",Waiting...

67,Blackace,"Waiting,,,, (too laugh). Over The Top, With Few Laughs",5,4 March 2006,"***** Contains Some Spoilers ****** I wanted to like this film, but the first 30mins of it had me scratching my head. I've watched many black comedy films like ""Me, Myself & Irene, There's Something About Mary, Raising Arizona, Fargo, Cable Guy and Dumb & Dumber"" and ALL of those films were 100x's better then ""Waiting..."".The first 30mins was basically an explanation on a ""Penis Game"" that is played by all the male employees and while it was clever, over the top and somewhat humorous; it shouldn't have been one of the main basis of the story. The movie tells the story of a day in the life of several restaurant waiters and cooks at a Shenanigan's restaurant. Not a place I would ever eat at, thankfully.The point of the movie is to show, in a funny way, how rough waiters, waitresses, cooks, busboys and managers have it while trying to run a restaurant. They use outlandish antics to keep their jobs fun and their minds sane. Unfortunately this doesn't work, at least not in this film. The whole movie is outlandish antics with poor sex jokes. Ryan Reynolds should know better after doing Van Wilder, which was another dud for him. He was much better in Blade Trilogy, where he delivered timely wisecracks that kept the audience awake. In ""Waiting..."" you'll be asleep after the first 15mins or walking out of the theater.The story begins with a new employee named Mitch (John Francis Daley from Freaks & Geeks) starting his first day at Shenanigan's. Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is suppose to show him how things are done, but instead rambles on about a penis exposure game that all the male employees play.The object is simple. Have another male employee walk in on you while you are holding your private parts out in different positions. If you catch someone looking, you call him a ""gay pervert"" and can kick him severals times in the butt. I'm not sure which writer of ""Waiting..."" thought this up, but he needs to be gagged, tied and forced to watch gay porn for 72hrs while water is continuously dripped on his forehead. In the meantime Dean, another waiter who really doesn't want to be a waiter, because another geek (like him) graduated college. He feels that he's going nowhere at Shenanigan's and when his boss Dan, (David Koechner) offers him a supervisor position, he has a hard decision to make.The film continues on with what you'd expect from the trailer. The cooks are dropping food on the floor and still serving it up to the customers, the head cook Raddimus (Luis Guzmán) is trying to find ways to keep his girlfriend, have sex with her and still cook bad food and Bishop (Chi McBride) another cook, is playing a psychiatrist for everyone who wants to listen to his philosophical dribble. Why he's in this movie is beyond me. They could have gotten anyone else to play this part with the same results.The only bright spot in this whole movie is Alanna Ubach (Naomi) who spends most of her time screaming at the other waiters/waitresses, while smiling and talking nice to the customers. It's a riot watching her switch back and forth from being a bitch to being an angel in a matter of seconds. The way they made her up, she is an ugly, over smoking angry women who wants respect; but check out her pics on IMDb which is like night and day. She gives a decent performance. Anna Faris, who was great in the ""Scary Movie"" flicks and in ""May"", seems out of place here, with not much to do.The busboys Nick (Andy Milonakis) & T-Dog (Max Kasch) are foul mouth buffoons who would have easily have been fired on the spot right after they said their first sentence. I did like the X-Rated rap song at the end of the movie while the credits were rolling. They spent most of the film trying to act gangster, but never really pulled it off.Last but not least, Danielle (Jordan Ladd) plays Deans girlfriend, but by the end of the movie you won't believe they're even together. There's no chemistry between them, and their relationship really goes no where, even after Dean finally makes his decision on the supervisor position. Natasha (Vanessa Lengies) is obviously in this film for her looks and to be hit on a few times by Monty. She has no memorable lines and the only thing you'll remember is that she's attractive. Hopefully her next movie ""Stick It"" will give her something to do.Overall I gave the film 5/10. I just didn't think it was very funny and I have a pretty good sense of humor. There were funnier scenes in Freddy Got Fingered (Tom Green) and that movie was horrible. The sex jokes were just lame and after watching the whole movie, the last place I wanted to go to was a restaurant. If all restaurants are like Shenanigan's, I'll just eat at home. If you must see this film, rent it and forget it.",Waiting...

The humor is crude and doesn't always land, but there's something endearing about the untapped potential of Justin Long's character. Aside from that storyline however, this movie is nothing but a string of raunchy jokes. The movie ends on a high note, with John Francis Daley quitting after his first day and frantically highlighting everyone's glaring character flaws.

This titles may be a bit course for some, but let's face it, confused 21 year olds tend to be coarse also.This title was very funny and like the ""Milf"" term that came out of American Pie, beware of ""The Goat"".

I know that often times customers aren't any better than the dirt underneath your finger nails; so when I heard about this movie I was, in short, excited. Finally a movie that exposes the rotten customer, but after seeing it I felt empty. Half of this movie was one big long dick joke. I spent 96-ish minuets watching a movie that focused more on how guys flash each other when what I wanted to see was 96-ish minuets of real-to-life customer and server interaction. While yes, the customer interactions in here were very real, the truth is there wasn't enough. The acting was decent, but the loud screaming chick annoyed me to no end. The story danced around a decision. I snickered at a few parts but I never found myself laughing out loud. The sexual humor felt very American Pie-esquire in some cases when I was expecting more of an Office Space/Dilbert style. If you serve, cook, host, or bartend at a restaurant you'll find some of this movie to be funny, but not enough to save it's soul.",Waiting...

In the day of the life of the workers of Shenanigans restaurant, we are introduced to several archetypes that as anyone who has worked in a restaurant will know. Ryan Reynolds, playing the EXACT same character he played in ""Van Wilder"" is Monty, the star of the restaurant, whose witty banter and life lessons serve to educate the new waiter on the staff (John Daley) There are some VERY funny moments in this movie, which focus mainly on the kitchen staff and their game playing, but as a whole the movie feels like a few good jokes wrapped inside a teenage coming of age movie. With a bit of tightening up, this movie could have been very good, but there's too many wasted opportunities. Chi Mcbride is featured as a sage dishwasher, but his role is ultimately wasted, as his character is there just for background, no substance whatever. Luis Guzman, is however hysterical in his role, very as a cook, who has a very special ability to gross people out with showings of his genitalia. Also watch out for comedian Dane Cook in a small role as another cook, who has some rather nasty surprises. Over all, worth a rental, as there are some good laughs, but not a classic by any means.",Waiting...

Meanwhile, there is a new guy there who doesn't say much throughout the whole thing, and you can tell how awkward he feels being the new one, we've all been there before.A whole lot of funny things happen. It has been a while since I have laughed so hard. My friend's girlfriend was laughing the entire time, and she thought it was particularly funny, since she was a waitress at the time.

If you could imagine filming grade school aged boys in the privacy of their own thoughts and circles of friends, then you might get a similar result to any given moment of ""waiting"". If you worship Beavis and Butthead to the point of enacting their every move and mindset, you'll enjoy ""waiting.""The thing is, everyone in this cast i've seen in other movies and enjoyed, it's not that there's no talent, I don't blame the actors, what a genuine shame at a waste of everyone's time and talent. I'm not even sure who to pinpoint the blame on. There's nothing funny, amusing, or thought provoking, about ""waiting"". There's nothing funny about the ""game"" played amongst the male staff, messing with food, bathroom sex, nervous urinating, crude discussions, nothing. In fact the only sympathetic or relate-able character in the whole movie is Mitch, who seems to escape the charade of stupid and genuinely acts like a real human being. The rest of the overtired, clichéd one dimensional staff are so unlikable that it's impossible to feel empathy towards them when they have horrible customers.I'm giving a generous 1 star, for the cast who I felt sorry for, and for the story thats suckitude is legendary.",Waiting...

One of the funniest scenes in movie history (in my opinion) is in this movie. I won't tell you what it is, all I will say is pay close close attention to the scene when JUSTIN LONG receives the business card from the guy he is waiting on. This scene is executed so well, and I laughed so hard when it was over. I still laugh thinking about it and I tell people I know who have scene it that this is the funniest part of the movie.

The problem for me is this: while I can tell you clearly why I should hate this film, I can't explain clearly why I don't. In fact, I was really rather taken by the whole thing (""charmed"" is probably too extreme of a term). I suppose it could have to do with the appealing cast (including Justin Long, Anna Faris, Dane Cook, Luis Guzman, David Koechner, Kaitlin Doubleday and the incomparable Ryan Reynolds), or maybe it could be that I am currently employed as a waiter.

That's not an insult in any way. I loved this flick and highly recommend it to anybody wanting to see a great comedy. Waiting though is not for everybody. It does have serious toilet/gross-out humor. Some scenes even might make people gag. Especially the scene that is shown over and over again where this nasty b---- of a woman has her steak, that she ordered well done and received it medium rare, sent back to the kitchen to have the cooks fix it. That is an extremely nasty scene that makes you definitely not want to send your food back to the kitchen. Waiting is about an eight hour shift that takes place at a restaurant called Shenanigans. It reminds me of Bennigans, an Irish style place. The film stars Ryan Reynolds who just knows how to be hysterical in a comedy. hell he even knows how to be funny as all hell in an action flick. If you don't believe me see Blade Trinity. Reynolds steal every scene he's in. It's no wonder Warner Brothers wants him to star as The Flash. As a comic book fan I hope he does. Reynold's is best known from the film Van Wilder. National lampoon's first good film in over ten years. Reynold's knows screwball comedies like no one else in Hollywood today. That's why he's so funny. You can tell he has a blast making his films as well as this one. Anna Farris takes a new turn and breaks out of her Scary Movie (please lord don't allow anymore Scary Movie sequels to be made) shell and works well with Reynolds. The other big character in the film is Justin Long (Dodeball) as Dean a kid who just wants to have his life be on track but can't get it together. Luis Guzzman also has plenty of memorable scenes as Raddimus, the head of the kitchen. My personal favorite character was Naomi played by the some what cute Allanna Ubach. She's just an evil, evil, woman and is so fake to her customers that you can't help but laugh. Waiting is just a good brainless comedy that knows how to make you laugh. In the mood for something different? Give it a shot. Like I said it's not for everybody, but I'm sure it will be enjoyed by most.

89,addicott,Genuinely funny and underrated.,9,17 February 2008,"A funny comedy - what a concept! Humor is one of my great loves in life and yet I'm not generally a big fan of comedy films because SO many of them have been disappointing. (A guy missing two fingers could count the number of SNL spin off home runs on one hand.) Most of the time they take a decent premise, maybe enough material for a few good 5 minute sketches, stretch it out to an hour and a half, weave in a domestic morality tale for your prudish date (every time!!), and voilà! Another half-assed comedy - just what the world needed.Waiting feels different. Written and directed by Rob McKittrick, a guy who's come through the trenches of the restaurant biz, he's got a story to tell and he seems to have been allowed to do so with a minimum of compromise.As the many detractors are so eager to point out, there isn't actually that much of a story in the conventional narrative-arc sense. So it's not a drama. (Do we find this title in the drama section?) It's more of an ensemble character study, a day-in-the-life, fly-on-the-wall sort of affair. Condensed and amplified for entertainment's sake, of course. That's right, folks: it's not a documentary either, and yet, a lot of the gags work for me precisely because they ring true.Is it really that hard to envision a restaurant staffed with degenerate chefs, sultry waitresses, a dorky manager, a rage freak, stoner busboys, some angst-ridden twenty-somethings and a gawking new guy who can never get a word in edgewise? If it is, you might be reading this through a portal from some kind of alternate reality plane.Sure, things get sophomoric at times. (You were expecting something else?) Sometimes it's a sophomoric world. I hate to say this, but I've heard real-life restaurant stories that make the gross-out sequences here look like a food safety training film.Much has been said about the penis-showing game. I thought it was amusing enough. Buy it or not, I love the irony of how this depraved ritual, something the corporate branch could never in a million years condone, is so key to the establishment's success. Informality begets better morale - makes perfect sense to me.Maybe I'm a bad person for enjoying this movie that some seem to feel is so utterly without merit. I tried to be disappointed, tried to be unimpressed, but in a world where most supposed comedies really make me yawn, this one really made me laugh. I watched it a second time and enjoyed it just as much. And I swap quotes from the film with friends, weeks later and we laugh some more. If this isn't the measure of a good comedy, I don't know what is.I hope more people will rent this film so it makes enough money to persuade the bigwigs to give McKittrick another project.

I didn't laugh even once. It was so bad I stopped watching after about 45 minutes, and spent another minute fast forwarding through the remainder of this poor excuse for a comedy. The film is so slimy and repulsive that I lost respect for certain actors who played a role in this film such as Ryan Reynolds and Luis Guzman. Justin Long was also in it, but I'll give him a pass since his character wasn't as sleazy as the others. Ignore the 6.9 rating given to this film by IMDb users and avoid wasting 1.5 hours of your life on this.

It doesn't bog itself down with unnecessary flashbacks, or try to paint some kind of broader picture. All it sets out to do is make you laugh for ninety minutes, and for that, it excels.At the same time, if you find yourself disliking the movie ten minutes in, then turn it off: you're probably a middle aged woman and well outside the target audience.

But I was stunned with the dialogue and story. What this movie lacks with budget, it makes up for in laughs.Rob McKittrick did a fantastic job in this film. He couldn't have caught the setting and atmosphere of a restaurant any better. The writing is the film's strongest aspect. The jokes are hilarious and the 'game' played by the co-workers is one of the most original ideas I've seen in film in a long time.The cast was great but with many flaws. I enjoyed the chefs the most out of the characters. They generate most of the 'game' playing and create the biggest hassle for the waiters. Great to watch. I didn't enjoy Justin Long. I loved his work in 'Dodgeball' because he portrays the character so well. He plays a wimpy and unconfident teenager. But when it comes to a character who has many friends within the workplace, giving sex advice and questioning his life goals...I just can't believe Justin Long as the character. Stick to what you do best, Justin.This film isn't for everyone. It's dirty, volgar, and inappropriately stupid in many ways but that's where most of the comedy is presented. If you can't get past all the offensive jokes, you will not see the beauty in this film. A great re-watchable movie.",Waiting...

This is a crappy movie, but it's funny. If you've ever worked in a restaurant, some of this will ring true. However, if you haven't, most of the jokes will fall flat.A good effort, but you get the sense that the people who made this movie never really worked in a restaurant, but managed to find a good representative sample. Ryan Reynolds, while as attractive as ever, is pretty bad here, but he's not a good actor. He is eye candy, and is forgiven.Standouts are Luis Guzman as the phallus-obsessed cook, and Alanna Ubach as the angry Naomi. Great characterizations. Props to Dane Cook, who I don't normally find that funny. Perhaps at 31, I am too old to understand the appeal of the incredibly unfunny Andy Milonakis as well as his partner in thespian crime here, Max Kasch. Both were a an awful drain, and fairly unnecessary.You don't watch ""Waiting..."" for cinematography or drama, or direction.

I too am a pussy.The movie was incredibly crude but it's over-the-top jokes made it even funnier than it would have been otherwise. There are some movies that can do something that by itself is vomit-inducing, and turn it into a hilarious and classic sequence. Other movies make one want to vomit on the actors and directors. Fortunately, Waiting falls into the former category.It's nothing as bad as Deuce Bigalow where we are treated to watching someone eat french fries that fell in a toilet and seeing a woman with a penis for a nose who blows out life-giving fluids when she sneezes.There are a few scenes that could have been deleted without the movie losing any of its humor. The drug use/party scenes were completely unnecessary and I felt added nothing to the movie. We could have done without the images of people passing joints and smoking bongs. It wasn't funny.

A new guy is starting, and its Reynolds job to show him the ropes, from how to serve customers to playing the game of showing other workers your cock and balls. There are some funny moments in the film and great lines, there are some other disgusting moments as well, like what they do to the not so nice female customers steak.

There was a horrible movie a few years ago about a New York restaurant that starred Stephen Tucci, I believe. It was flat and unfunny from beginning to end and the critics raved about it. This movie is actually funny. What stands out about this movie is the group effort. No one actor or actress carries the thing as in a Jim Carrey flick or a Ben Stiller flick or some other over-rated ass clown. Everyone in the cast has his or her moment. The energy of the movie never flags. The humor is tuned to a certain pitch which may determine whether or not you like Waiting. My only complaint is the absence of T and A.

His performance of Monty, a child-man was quite a different than in Van Wilder, but yet, more hilarious. The way he never allows Mitch to say anything is one of my favorite parts of the movie. Also, the scene where Serena ""slap"" his pride in front of everybody was memorable... When it comes to that,Anna Faris was perfect in a supporting role. Justin Long played more serious role than the rest of the cast, but he finds himself very good in it. Of course, Luis Guzman steals the show. His ""game"" made me look deep inside me... Ha,ha,ha,... Raddimus is king, period. Also, we have Floyd (Dane Cook),one of the workers in the kitchen, in charge of ""punishing"" the ""bitches of the day"".Then, there are Nick and T-dog, Naomi (a little bit nervous), and of course, always unbelievable funny David Koechner and Chi McBride.Highly recommended movie with message: don't fool around with people who bring your food!!!",Waiting...
107,kaspen12,"Watchable, but could have been so much more",3,20 February 2006,"So what's 'Waiting...' about? Nothing, really. Monty (Ryan Reynolds) leads a fresh hire around his new place of work -- Shenaniganz Restaurant -- showing him the ropes. Meanwhile, Dean (Justin Long) feels like he's wasting his life away working a dead-end job in a low-end restaurant franchise. In the background, the rest of the staff (highlighted by Luis Guzman, Anna Faris, Dane Cook, and the boss, David Koechner) play it up with some wacky hijinx that are occasionally laugh-worthy. And that's pretty much it. It follows the staff through an average day at Shenaniganz, with Dean's ""crisis"" the main plot-point.What's the problem then? 'Waiting...' feels like Amateur Hour at a stand-up comedy club. You laugh, you feel slightly uncomfortable, you groan a few times, and then you laugh hard. For a gross-out comedy, it's really something of a mixed-bag, but when it hits, it hits hard. The only problem is first-time writer-director Rob McKittrick doesn't know when to kill a joke when it's run its course. The same tired routines that barely worked the first time keep getting drawn out further and further. There's definitely some potential here for a great movie, as each cast member gets their own scene to truly shine in. The problem is the script's complete lack of polish, which seems rushed into production before it really had a chance to find its direction.FINAL SCORE: 6.1 = CSolid performances from a cast of comic marvels stop this ship from sinking completely. Reynolds is especially outstanding as Monty, and he and Long have pretty good chemistry together. Still, without a script to match their talents, the jokes just aren't there consistently enough. 'Waiting...' had the potential to be something great. It just should have waited a little longer.",Waiting...

Most kids raised in the United States who have attended even only a bit of college have had that feeling of abandonment and pondering the future. However, this is not enough to make a film successful.If this is what some restaurant employees do with the food behind the scenes, I'm never eating out in a Bclass establishment again.

I totally accept there is little intellect in the jokes, and it won't appeal to those much older (I don't think) but for what it is, its pretty damn funny.I'm English and this doesn't tend to be our sort of humour, we prefer dryer humour where as this is quit in your face American. But this had me laughing a hell of a lot. Some of the scenes are side splitting which for me to say is quite rare. Ryan Reynolds scene with his mum although cringe worthy is hilarious! and 'the game' doesn't get boring and although very male humour can see women finding a giggle there. Before this I was unsure about Ryan Reynolds, although he was good in Van Wilder, but this made me realise he is genuinely a funny guy. Anna Faris is good after her recent shockers (scary movie 3,4) and the whole cast all seem to bounce well of each other as a team of actors and employee's. The chefs are brilliant and deliver some funny lines...but best of all Luis Guzman (Raddimus) is hilarious throughout as a Nymphomaniac and all round joker, this to me seemed like the part he was born to play, he had me almost in tears.This film I can see not appealing to everyone obviously, but if you like the American Pies, Van Wilder those sort of comedies then this should be right up your street. I admit the humour isn't clever but it is funny. Date Movie made me loose my faith in Teen Comedies, or stupid humour if you prefer along with the latter Scary Movies but this has restored my faith and has made me a fan of much of the cast, I look forward to its DVD release (although I've sadly seen it twice already) and having another watch of a lot of funny people!

You don't have to have such experience to become easily nauseated by the superficial atmosphere of community and collectivism that is about as force-fed in this flick as a real dead end job. I will not bother to write much about this one because it simply doesn't deserve the attention, and aspire only to warn others to avoid it unless they happen to be a preteen or otherwise entirely devoid of taste. If it weren't for the competent editing and cinematography this movie would have scored absolutely no stars from me, but instead I give it two for the effort. In a nutshell, the funniest actors in this movie (Long, Faris) play straight roles that brink pretentious, and the wild card in Ryan Reynolds is under utilized by a typical typecast of being ""the dick"". And WHAT a dick he is. His character would be the sole source of WAITING's sexist undertones if the women characters weren't so poorly written. The plot is shallow, as expected, but is made worse by the futile effort to portray a seriously conflicted protagonist who juggles a mirage of ""important"" choices. The intended setpiece is a scene consisting of the restaurant staff collaborating to botch the dinner of some unruly customer in the least imaginative, yet most disgusting way possible.

While fun in it's premise, it is flawed in it's execution. The actress who plays the generic, loud, bitchy waitress is almost as annoying as listening to Barbara Streisand talk politics.

125,Green_Eyed_Monster,"Not really what I expected... ""Laugh out loud"" funny!",7,29 May 2006,"I first want to say that I don't normally go for films like this, mainly because they're usually really bad. I refer of course to films such as Zoolander, Van Wilder, and the Scary Movies (I know I just upset a lot of people by saying that, and I'm sorry!), so when I saw the trailer for this film it got the compulsory eye role, the sigh, and was assigned to the black list of films I knew I never wanted to see. Unfortunately, I have a friend who loves films like this, and since she had to ""endure"" The Da Vinci Code last week, I was emotionally blackmailed to come and see this with her.I'm sooo glad I did! At one point I laughed so hard I thought I was going to wee! It starts quite slow, and there's about 15 minutes at the start that just focuses on a bunch of characters you don't really care about, and then Ryan Reynolds comes in! He's not particularly funny in this, doing his usual one liners and cleverly timed eye brow wiggles. Its mainly how the other characters react to him that's so pant wettingly funny, especially the angry, slightly psychotic waitress (you'll see).The let down in this film though is its over focus on Justin Long's character. He's the cliché young person who doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life, and therefore has found himself being a waiter for too long. He does OK but he's really boring! I really did enjoy this film, and it wasn't too long so I didn't get bored as I usually do with the majority of the American teen comedies. Its definitely worth a watch, and has made me think twice about judging a film by its genre!",Waiting...
126,parkblvd,an EXCELLENT movie made poorer by direction,7,13 February 2006,"Waiting is, as you'd expect, a Ryan Reynolds themed movie about life in the service industry. All the other reviewers have covered how well this movie nails the service industry (or ""working in a restaurant""), so I won't bother. I will say that I like Ryan Reynolds movies, and was expecting more of his usual out of Waiting.Bizarrely, I got far more and far less than I expected. The cast is beyond first rate - Luis Guzman, Anna Faris, Dane Cook... The acting in this movie could have been amazing. Add to that a script that steals the good parts out of a half a dozen indie blockbusters, and you have what could have been a great movie.But the writer is also the director. I won't give his name - it's irrelevant, as this is his first and last movie. What's relevant is that, although he envisioned some amazing characters, he had no idea how to bring them to life. Luis Guzman's character, for instance, would have been AMAZING with a little lead-in. The black kitchen chef (whose schtick you have to watch the movie to understand) was miscast, misdirected, and just destroyed what could have been the heart of this movie. The female leads both seemed to have no underlying personality at all, which is bizarre for Anna Faris. And the manager was portrayed competently, but I won't be quoting him, even though he had some funny lines.For the money, the movie was worth it. I wanted a Ryan Reynolds film, and I got a Ryan Reynolds film. But it's sort of like what might have happened if he'd starred in Clerks (and someone else had directed it) - it would have been a funny movie, but ultimately forgettable.",Waiting...

I did like some of the laughs, but a lot of them had been done before. The rudeness of some of the setups was fresh and unique, but the problem I had is so few movies dare to really go over that edge. I won't give anything away, but there is only one scene that they really went over, and my girlfriend and I BOTH think they should of put in A LOT more of those to achieve cult status. Both her and I LOVE Ryan Reynolds, but felt he is capable of WAY more sick and twisted depth as an actor. Look at him in ""Buying the Cow"" and you'll see what I mean. So, is it worth seeing? Yes, especially if you've waited on tables or worked in the industry. Is it worth buying? No, once you've seen it...you'll never want to see it again.P.S.

131,truetexian,An assault on the senses,3,16 February 2006,"OK, so going into it, I wasn't naive. I knew it was going to be vulgar and course but I hoped it would provide some humor in the low-brow sense. In those respects, it delivered and can not be rated a failure or even a disappointment. What did denigrate the entire movie for me was the Rap performance during the ending credits. That was an unwarranted and certainly unwanted assault on my senses! It spurred a discussion with the clerks at my local video store upon my return of the DVD. I wanted, and in fact needed to know, what young people thought of the ""song's"" message and content. What I discovered was truly disturbing. One said that he felt that most twenty-somethings probably thought it was just ""funny"" and the other one said that he felt that he and his generation were ""desensitized"" to ""stuff like that""! Either possibility extremely saddens me! The message of that rap performance, and I'm sure of many more as yet unheard by me, is something not to find ""funny"" nor to make fun of...and, I personally think that it's a cop-out to say that you're ""desensitized"" to it. If you have a mind and a sense of dignity for yourself and others around you, I would think that you would have nothing but outrage for it. The rap ""artist"" Andy Milonakis will surely, by his disrespect and unhappiness for himself and the rest of us, push us all toward the second dark ages where censorship will halt any creativity whatsoever. Milonakis and those like him and all that hail him as a talent are men to feel sadness and pity for.

Sure, it's comprised of mostly genitalia jokes, cursing and raunchy sex-humor - but it's all done so well it's hard not to love it, so long as you're not offended by it.The character definition and casting were done extremely well. Everyone involved in this movie meshes better than one would expect for a lot of low-profile actors (at the time it was cast). Ryan Reynolds of course leads the cast, but both Luis Guzman and Dane Cook put forth awesome performances. That's not to knock the ladies either as Anna, Kaitlin and Alanna were all great as well. The content is both mature and exceedingly immature - which is what makes it so enjoyable. I highly recommend this movie! Incidentally, for anyone who hasn't worked in the service industry, there's so much frightening truth to nearly everything in this movie that it's practically nostalgic to those of us who have. I enjoyed it so much, that I actually watched the full 2nd DVD of extras - just for a few extra bits about what went into the movie and the actor's perspective at what they'd done.",Waiting...

Come to think about it Ryan Reynolds was in Harold and Kumar.. Regardless anyone who has worked in any kind of service industry will appreciate this movie.

Whatever the problem, everyone tried to help each other get thorough it.There was also some touching moments as was seen when Chett gave Dean a large tip.

When a movie is horrible, I've got plenty to say. But, this movie was AWESOME and I actually wish that it was longer. Regardless though, I am a low to medium budget person, and restaurants like ""Shenanigan's"" are places that I frequent. They covered all the bases. The loser-hiding-behind-the-title manager, who should've stayed for 2 more years in college, and couldn't get laid if he found a million dollars. A HOTTIE jail-bait hostess girl, almost 18, and driving everybody wild. The waitresses over-acted to the customers for tips, and the busboys are little wanna-be gangsters who'll probably stay at Shenanigan's and become cooks. The penis-showing game I HOPE TO GOD doesn't really happen at these places, and trust me, I am ALWAYS satisfied with the way they cooked my food at restaurants, now! The ONE thing I didn't care for was Justin Long, as I didn't feel like they needed a whiny ""Dunno what to do"" character, but it did make a good scene when the more successful high school graduate that he despised came in to eat and talked about himself, didn't care about Justin Long's life, but tipped him $100. It all ties together for a GREAT, great, great movie. The sequel didn't have any of the same characters, so I didn't even watch it. So, watch this one, love it, and forget about the 2nd one.

137,gaz_savage,One of the best comedies I've seen,10,18 May 2006,"When you see who the cast has in it you are expecting to watch a good film so your hopes are already high, I went to see this and we left the cinema buzzing and created our own ""game"" from this film lol....We could also not believe how alike 3 of the characters were to my friend group as one is like Ryan Reynolds and sleeps with lots of women, I'm the one who's not sure wot to do with my life, and then we have another friend who lets women walk over him so we enjoyed this movie just for that mostly. Ryan Reynolds definitely gives this movie life like nobody else could, he plays someone who's confident in what they do and believes that he's always right and he pulls it off magnificently, Justin Long who I like in Dodgeball plays a totally different part to that and I enjoyed his performance, someone I was disappointed in was Anna Faris she just seems to play the same part over and over again and I don't think she was needed in this film.So anyway the film is based over the course of one shift in a restaurant called Shenanigans it starts off with Ryan Reynolds showing around John Francis Daley who plays Mitch, it becomes very clear in the beginning that he is not gonna say very much during the whole film as no one lets him says a word and you can see this gradually getting to him as the movie goes on....The film then goes from people getting their food spat in to other problems with in the restaurant business and finally ends with a party in the end I could talk about this longer but I don't want to ruin it for anyone....Enjoy it, I did",Waiting...

I work at a movie theater and I see a lot of big budget crap I would never pay for, like I do anyway. But that's beside the point. My point is, Waiting... is one of the funniest movies, and grossest I've seen in a long time. And this is coming from a guy who loves Family Guy, Wedding Crashers, Van Wilder, and even some of the less witty comedies, like Dumb and Dumber and even the Naked Gun series. But this has been the only movie I've watched three times in the span of it's opening weekend. However, I do admit that I laughed harder in Both Wedding Crashers and the 40 Year Old Virgin, but it was a more consistent laugh with Waiting. I've come to the conclusion that Ryan Reynolds would probably be one of the coolest dudes to hang out with on and off the set. His character is a little less dynamic and memorable as Van Wilder is. (I took notes on how Van Wilder handled himself with people) Monty just seems kind of shallow and empty in perspective. I dunno, maybe it's just me. But, the supporting cast adds more depth, even if the movie didn't really need it. It's a movie about a restaurant.I believe, in terms of quotation and mimicry (good quotes AND fun games...) that it puts to shame Napoleon Dyna...who? Waiting is the quotable movie for those people who don't like boring PG movies. Even though High School girl's can't seem to get enough of it.

Although some people may feel that way even after seeing it, I was pleasantly surprised. From the introduction of 'the game' near the beginning of the movie, I knew this was going to be more interesting and even more disturbing than the previews.Despite what appears to be rather thin characterization, 'Waiting' succeeds at being a good character-driven movie. I am not sure why this is. Perhaps what seem to be just childish antics add depth to the characters without us realizing it. Some people complain that 'the game' is a 10 second gag stretched out for the entire film, and on the surface, this is true. However, the game is really more of a mechanism for developing characters than anything on its own. The result is a set of very flawed, but surprisingly likable characters. Also, the ending, though a little abrupt, is entertaining largely because the movie does a good job of setting up the characters and situation.This movie is not for everyone. If you do not like 'stupid' humor, then you will probably not be able to overlook that to enjoy the more subtle aspects.

I'm on leave from the job since I'm at college right now, but this movie had me laughing, reminiscing, and looking forward to the end of the semester when I go back to work. Sure, food service sucks.

Sure, but who cares? Everyone knows its a crap job, the customers are rude, and you will have disgusting things done to your food if you pi** the workers off. That's why no one stays in these jobs for long.Although the writer says he was influenced by Kevin Smith's Clerks, Waiting completely lacks the witty dialog and geeky comic book fun of Kevin Smith's movies. This movie much more closely resembles ""Dazed and Confused."" In that, nothing really happens of any importance, and there is no real central character. Sure there is one guy who has to decide whether to take a manager's position, or go back to school, but again, who cares? This is very familiar to ""Pink Floyd's"" decision to sign to the piece of paper and stay on the football team, or go have fun. Even the new guy in Waiting is similar to the freshman in D&C.

Each of the characters is someone (or a few people) that we have all worked with or been at one point or another (Im sure all of you have had a Naomi moment or two).

Everyone does a great job in portraying their character that you really feel like you are a part of their lives for the entire length of the film, and I am sure that can even go for people that haven't worked in such food service. I have worked for a company just like Shennanigan's (I won't say the name, but you know what it is). It seems like this movie was made by waiters and waitresses. They seemed to nail everything a waiter/waitress encounters in this work environment Ir; the jerk customer, the short tipper, the last minute customer. I am glad they put so much thought into this movie. I go through there and try to bust them on something, and it seems like they thought of everything, from the way business is ran all the way down to even talking about rotating the seating. I felt like I was back at work with my apron on. This movie does a great job on showing you behind the scenes at a restaurant. The sad thing is, when you are a customer, you usually only see the nice stuff. There's a different world going on when your server is away from your table. The moral of this story, movie, and to any food server out there is, be careful how you treat these people.... you don't want to regret it.",Waiting...
166,cansukarayazi,Back stage of a restaurant..,6,26 January 2010,"The movie 'Waiting' written and directed by Rob McKittrick depicts the interactions of a restaurant crew in a 24-hour period. It shows the back stage of the service business which also involves a great amount of emotional labor. ""Emotional labor in service roles: The influence of identity."" written by Ashforth, Blake E. and Ronald H. Humphrey explains why jobs require emotional labor and can also be used to analyze the table waiting job as well as the reasons of the waiter/ waitress relationship in the movie. Blake and Humphrey seek the answer to the question why certain jobs require emotional labor. According to them,workers are assigned to make customers feel in certain way that organization wants them to feel. If the organization wants the customer to feel happy, workers are supposed to make it happen, or if the organization wants to humiliate customers, again it is workers job to humiliate them. ""As an example on differences in the kind of display rules, Rafaeli and Sutton (1991) demonstrated how police interrogators and bill collectors expressed hostility and coldness to induce anxiety in suspects or debtors. (Ashforth and Humphrey 92) ""Thus, flight attendants are expected to feel cheerful and friendly.. "" (Ashforth 89) Flight attendants give and how nice they are to their customers, and the hostile attitude of bill collectors. Flight attendants are so nice because they want to impress their customers, and bill collectors or police interrogators are usually cold because they intend to humiliate people, but in both cases it is not up to their decision to act in those certain ways; it is definitely the decision of the organization they work for. An airline company wants to satisfy the needs of their customers so they would seek service from the same company again, in contrast a bill collecting firm wants its customers to pay their bills and they use humiliation as a way to make customers do it. In the movie 'Waiting' the waiters and waitresses are providing emotional labor. They are trying to impress their customers and make them feel happy, which is not necessarily their decision but the managements. They are given briefings by the manager to increase their motivation to work and make sure that customers are happy with the service they are provided. In other words, the crew at the Shenanigans chain restaurant delivers a service closely related with the restaurant's costumer satisfaction policy.Also, firms provide emotional labor because it would make the interaction between customer and the worker go more smoothly. "" ..the manner in which one displays feelings has a strong impact on the quality of service transactions, the attractiveness of the intra personal climate, and the experience of emotion itself."" (Ashforth 88) In the movie, we see a very picky customer ordering her food and complaining about the steak dinner she ordered. Her attitude and language irritates the waitress who is trying to handle the situation and trying to be nice and patient. The customer acts very arrogant and rude so the interaction between two becomes very tense. Then, the wait staff asks Monty- another staff to replace her because she cannot handle the aggravating situation with the customer anymore. Monty succeeds at impressing the customer with his confidence and satisfies her by his 'I know how you feel' attitude, tells her that she is absolutely right and takes her food back to the kitchen since she thought her steak was under cooked.",Waiting...

It was an experience that I won't forget. If you are going to see a great movie, see A History of Violence or The Constant Gardener instead, but if you are looking for a movie that you can just sit laughing your a** off, then this is the one for you. Of course there is no plot, no definition of character, no truths, no background, truly all the movie is is a series of jokes. It just so happens though, that all of these jokes are hysterically funny. I only regret that they didn't give Dane Cook a bigger part considering he is one of the funniest people alive today.

Then they wrap the movie up with this shitty coming of age BS that could have been ripped from any other movie, book, or TV show about this age group. This was absolutely pathetic. The movie had one half-formed joke and they repeated it over, and over, and over. There was also some utterly predictable cr*p about messing with customers and how hard it is to be young that was totally forgettable. And, contrary to what most of the reviews say, completely inaccurate. No one messes with food that gets sent back because you can get the kind of lawsuit that will leave you permanently bankrupt from that kind of sh*t. Every other shred of half-hearted observational humor was so obvious that it wasn't funny.I am from this age group. I am a bar tender. I am the target demographic.

I have been to the restaurant that the filmed this at so there was some connection with the movie but other than that the characters were one-dimensional and in most cases: completely unfunny. The script seemed like they were trying to be edgy and funny with quick quips about society and the people in the restaurant, but for the most part it did not work at all. This flick was made in the wake of other kitchen comedies in the works: Fox's Kitchen Confiential and ABC's Freddie, both dealt with comedy in the restaurant business. The movie was nothing special and easily forgettable, at least that is one quality I am thankful for.

It isn't all bad though, the incredibly memorable characters have you cheering for them during various scenes and the hilarious jokes have you wishing you had thought of them before. One particular joke runs throughout the movie: the penis-showing game is a friendly game the men working at Shennagins (the movie's restaurant) play. This games involves one man tricking another into seeing his genitals and then ridiculing him for seeing them, hilarity ensues.

I'm sure that anyone who has or does work at a restaurant can compare themselves to at least one of the characters in the film.

No wonder they don't like this movie.",4,16 October 2005,"So many critics have been asking how writer/director Rob McKittrick got such good actors to be in his film. The answer is simple, actors waited tables. The restaurant industry has it's own unique subculture. The job is insane. You're day usually starts with sitting around talking to other waiters, doing whatever back of the house work before opening, then standing around talking to other waiters while customers trickle into the restaurant.Waiting tables is a lot of down times spiced with a few hours of utterly exhausting, frenzied madness. When it's all said and done, the doors have closed, you've cleaned your section, paid the restaurant and rolled silverware, you're pumped and it's midnight to two in the morning. You can't call a nine to fiver. So, you go out with your co workers.Waiting...perfectly captures the controlled insanity that is a chain restaurant. Most especially in the Friday'sesq. chain restaurants you are dealing with hungry people who want sit down food in fast food time. I waited tables for years, my husband waited tables for years. We both found this film, not only immensely amusing but eerily biographical. I have actually heard another server at a restaurant say, ""You obviously need this more than I do."" to a departing cheap tipper while returning the tip. I was disappointed that my line for bad tips, which I'll admit was only said at the offending table after the guest had left, ""Now Timmy can finally get that operation."" One thing I am disappointed about, is the failure to take the opportunity to educate the public at large about table rent. Table rent being the percentage of the servers food sales he or she is required to pay back to the restaurant at the end of the night. So, if you sold 100 dollars worth of food and collected 100 dollars payment from your customers you would have to pay the restaurant 103 to 105 at the end of the night. The server is expected to cover this out of his or her tips. The extra 3 to 5 percent is split evenly between the hostesses, bar tenders and bus boys at the end of the night.He also failed to point out that servers don't make minimum wage in most states. My husband and I never made more than 2.13 per hour. Once again, the server is expected to make up the difference in tips. This is how it is possible for a waiter to actually pay for the privilege of serving if he or she is faced with a short shift with poor tippers. People need to realize that the industry assumes you will tip at least 15%. Why not? They won't suffer if you don't. They've found a way to get out of paying full price for their labor. I imagine customers would pay a lot more than an extra 15% if restaurants actually paid hostesses, waiters, bus boys and bar tenders what they were worth.If he had actually addressed these issues and toned down the gross out humor, this film might have had a better chance with a wider audience. They would have at least had something to chew over in the parking lot. However, I know that this movie is still freaking hilarious to me and mine. McKittrick really captured what it's like to wait.",Waiting...

Then finally I pulled out the movie and took a better look at it.The cast was very astronomical. They were very proficient actors! I couldn't wait to watch it! I had to fetch the DVD player from my attic, which I forgot about it because I just moved into this new house, because I just divorced my wife because she cheated on me, but thats a whole gangling and lofty story. I looked into the DVD box, but to my astonishment it was not there! After a half hour of looking in the hot and stuffy attic, I finally found it in the box that was labeled ""bathroom towels"" Then I went back down stairs I hooked it up and popped the DVD in! Then I couldn't find my remote!!! I looked around my living room, but I couldn't find it. Then I sat on my couch to relax for a quick second and a strange object was poking my side. It was the remote, Then I pressed input and went to the DVD screen. As the movie started I quickly popped some popcorn, the label said to cook it in exactly 2:45 seconds but I toned it down to 2:30 because it gets too hot.I was very surprised about the menu screen It was very plain and simple. At first I truly did not know what to do. I spent 5 minutes starring at the TV screen. At first I thought I bought a Spanish version according to the menu options. Then I just went to the DVD player and pressed play and it started. The movie was okay.",Waiting...

Most ""normal"" moviegoers will find this film childish, poorly acted, and annoying. However, if you have ever worked in a restaurant for any good period of time, you will find plenty to love about this over-the-top look into the service industry. The characters are pretty much like my old co-workers, only taken to the extremes of their strange personalities. The story is not strong, but really the story is more about all the stuff you WISH you could do in a restaurant. If you work in a restaurant, or in the service industry in general, see this film right away. If you don't work in a restaurant, don't see it. It's really that simple.",Waiting...

I have stopped listening to his movie recommendations.The basic idea is that someone who worked as a waiter, has taken the time to write down all the horror stories/ urban kitchen legends down, and then stapled the pages together. Job Done, well done lads thats another script for the movie making machine to churn out.No story, no plot, just a string of anecdotes. I don't mind this. If its done well. Pulp fiction for example, is a superb film. Well executed script keeps you interested despite the fact there is no great point or conclusion. The acting is unspectacular.The ""game"" played by the staff is milked and massaged to fill the cavernous gaps in the story. The game could have been explained in 3 minutes, not used to bring the movie to the usual 90 minute attention span and bladder limit of most movie go-ers.In short, if you are channel hopping, and happen to come across it, and there is nothing else on, then watch it.

What they left out was the early bird elderly people who would come in for supper around 4 or 5 in the afternoon, and nothing was ever good enough. The salad bar was wilting, the steak wasn't cooked right, the soup may taste like mushroom soup but it wasn't, too much or not enough ice in the glasses, etc. And, yes, the dynamic between the cook staff and the wait staff is very fragile.

Reynold's witty comments and spectacular delivery makes ties the movie together with the rest of the characters who must have been based on actual people. Anyone who has worked at a restaurant will identify with this movie and it's characters.

209,bnolley,Hilarious - a very pleasant surprise!,10,8 April 2006,"I originally rented this movie simply because I noticed that it had Ryan Reynolds in it. I hadn't heard anything about it other than someone in line at the video store complaining that it was so gross. With the hope of finding a shirtless Ryan scene (this should occur in all of his movies), I began watching the flick. It's just hilarious from beginning to end! If you have ever worked in food service before, then you must see it. You will be able to identify and reflect on so many of the things that happen in the movie from tampering with food, to dealing with wretched customers, to dealing relationships with co-workers. The story is mainly focused on Justin Long's character Dean's coming to terms with where he is in life and where he wants to be. But, the best parts and lines in the movie involve Ryan Reynold's character Monty (including his scene with his mother played by Wendie Malick), Luis Guzman's character Raddimus (the way that he seduces his girlfriend is priceless), and Anna Ferris' character Serena (her argument with Monty is full of unforgettable lines).

210,hbk812,waiting,8,6 February 2007,"Alright, to everybody that commented that this is a college humor film, maybe you should consider watching comedies that aren't spoon fed to you. Movies such as Pooty Tang and American Pie: Band Camp would probably fall under that category but Waiting is in a league of its own. No, I'm not saying that it is the best movie ever made but it is an extremely funny movie. Prime example; I, as well as many of you probably know people in the 50's who seem to have been serving tables their entire lives. This film not only touches on the dick and fart jokes, but also connects with an adult audience. The writer was able to touch on every possible thing that the restaurant business has to offer to a comedy. This doesn't even just apply to people who have worked in the restaurant business. Naturally, just about everybody can or has been able to connect with the fact that we ask ourselves, ""what the hell am i doing with my life?"", ""who am I?"", ""why am i the last of my friends do $#*@ing grow up?"" The writing was great in this movie as well as the directing. Also considering that Waiting was Rob Mickitric's first movie. I'd have to say hey did a damn good job for his first film. As for Ryan Reyhnolds, he basically played his character in Van Wilder. I personally know that this was an issue due to the fact that by the time Waiting actually got around to being made, he didn't want to play the same character in two comedies so close together. Dane Cook on the other hand had the perfect amount of screen time. Anything more would have probably turned out like Employee of the Month (and you called Waiting a college film?). He was able to deliver the lines that Rob wrote better than anybody else (with an exception of Christopher Walken). All and all, all you Waiting haters should stop tearing apart this film and go try making something better. Not happening.HBK812",Waiting...
211,ryan_gallant,Could almost be a documentary,8,9 June 2007,"I'm guessing a lot of people who watch this probably think it's just a comedy with a bunch of made up jokes that never happen in real life. This is not the case.What I liked about it is that it actually showed you what life as a waiter is like. I no longer serve tables for a living, but I used to do it for 5 years and I could relate to almost everything that happens in this movie.(Except the ""showing the penis"" game)When they hit that dinner rush, what happens is exactly as in real life. Servers get tables that go in and are bitchy every single day, and even though I've never personally done anything to someone's food, I know people who have. Like they say in the movie, don't mess with someone who handles your food.The same as the ""hick"" who comes in, eats for $60, and leaves a $2 tip. The common thing is to leave 15% which would be $9 on a bill like that, and if you receive good service, you tip more.The arguments in the kitchen, the cooks counting down to closing and hoping nobody comes in, the manager flirting with the underage workers. That all happens in every restaurant.I really liked the movie because I could relate to it. If you're a server yourself, I'm sure you'll enjoy, or already have enjoyed this movie. Hopefully, viewers that aren't servers can learn from this movie because there's nothing servers hate more than when you come in and you act like any of the customers that were shown in this movie(Act bitchy, show up 3 minutes before close, complain about food after you've eaten the whole thing, etc.). As a customer, you're also going in to enjoy a nice meal, so don't you think your experience will be lot better if you respect your server as opposed to treating them like a slave.Servers work their butts off to give the best service possible, but if you don't tip, or act like an idiot when you're there, they'd be just as well working at a fast food joint.This movie showed a great example of what the life of a server is like.

Also disappointed that Ryan Reynolds could stoop this low for work, he, IMHO is better, and I have seen better from him, and hope it's soon. In Amnityville Horror, his role was good, it shows some versatility, but he seems better in comedic roles, where he acts more at home to me, more at ease. His role in Blade Trinity was good also.

Although some details were a bit far-fetched (the game, the busboys), most of the goings-on were true to life - we had a girl who would hold quick make-out sessions in the dish pit and there was a cook just like Dane Cook's character. I personally trained a girl who was so zonked on some substance that she would zone out when waiting to get on a register. There were a few things that were left out or glazed over - hosting can be just as demanding as waiting, and nearly EVERYONE smokes (shoulda been more scenes of breaks!) - but everyone who has done the job can attest to the crazy things that can go on. I personally think everyone should do it for a little while to learn some humility, as well as to meet interesting individuals.

However, my brother seems more entranced by it than I do, and he's a firefighter...Anyhow, acting is great. I found myself identifying with not only the new guy, who doesn't ever get a word in and is subjected to horrifyingly boring ""training"" about stuff he already knows, and the high-strung dark-haired waitress. In the back, bitch bitch bitch they don't tip, bitch bitch bitch, fat lady got two entrees, a salad, crabcakes, and two desserts, bitch bitch bitch - totally me.In truth, I think that right there is the heart of the movie. For those who have worked in 'the industry,' we see ourselves at work, and we laugh. We see ourselves at play (c'mon, we ALL go out and party together, unless you have a really negative workplace atmosphere) and we laugh harder. Although I've never encountered things like the game that they play, quite, I've encountered similar things, such as towel-whipping games and the like, and most definitely, everyone's sex lives are out in the open in the restaurant world.

Great find for those of you in the industry, for those who aren't - well, if you've ever BEEN to a restaurant, then it's STILL a great laugh?

The only character who was remotely representative of a real waitress was Naomi's, and this was mainly due to her two facedness and the way she spoke to the chefs.The gags were uber shallow, the acting was dull and the storyline was like watching an advert for senior citizen life assurance. However the main thing that annoyed and angered me about this film was the blatant homophobia! In this day and age i would expect film producers to have the sense not to make films which target minority groups. I mean would they have really got away with, throughout a film, calling people black and kicking them for it????? Yes i am talking about the theme which runs throughout the entire film of goading another man into looking at your genitals, calling them a ""fag"" and then having the privilege of physically abusing them for that reason.

222,toad_361,what was so funny about this movie?,3,27 January 2006,"don't get me wrong, there are movies that suck worse than this, but sometimes those movies have some sort of goal. the only goal this movie seems to have is attaining cult status or trying to get people to start ""the game"" in their places of work. i mean, it couldn't have been trying to make me laugh... where are all the jokes? maybe you have to have been a waiter to get why this is so funny, because i really don't understand the humor in all of the bodily function jokes in this movie. even farts are funnier than this for Christ's sake. and while the actors may have put forth a valiant effort to breathe life into the dialogue, so much of it just felt scripted... each of the waiters had the same mouth pasted on a different character and hardly any of the characters were really all that funny or interesting to begin with. if it weren't for luis guzman in those ridiculous cook pants and the very last shot after the credits, this movie would have lacked any kind of humor whatsoever. it's as if rob mckittrick thought, hey, i'll make a movie based on the five minutes of office space where jennifer aniston is working at chotchkie's, but i'm going to make it a whole lot stupider and then take one sex joke that would be a throwaway in clerks and put that where the plot should be. sometimes i don't mind when movies don't have much of a plot, as long as they hold my interest in other areas. there is genius hidden in this format somewhere, but all this movie does is validate just how brilliant office space and clerks really are. watch one of them again instead of this.",Waiting...

As it turned out however, Dane Cook was not in it as much as I'd hoped, but I thought it genuinely funny. It can be appreciated by those who work in this setting and appreciate the humor that comes from the things they do. Dane Cook delivers some of the funniest parts of this movie, but Ryan Reynolds is very funny also. The plot is mildly intriguing, but somewhat lame. The constant joke that comes up is somewhat childish and not funny, but the movie delivers some laughs and is worth a shot, especially if you are a waiter/waitress or hosti. Overall it was slightly juvenile and not as intelligent as it could have been (the writers seem like they could have made it in a much more juvenalian satire format) but still worth the laughs.

Its never going to win any awards, and doesn't even try to. From the 5-second rule to the intermingled sex lives of the staff to the retarded manager, this movie hits the nail right on the head.

This movie also makes a lot of references to sex and genitalia, so if you're interested in a good drinking game, take a drink every time you hear one of those references. ALSO, if you EVER want to be someone in this world, you need to know who Dane Cook is (plays Floyd in the movie.) My biggest complaint about the movie is that there isn't enough of him in it.

Van Wilder was funny, it had dimensions, but this movie is a restaurant, and someone's house. That's it.I felt the entire movie was dedicated to people like myself who worked in a kitchen or were a waiter and it was crying out ""relate to me"" ""This really is sorta how a restaurant is, with a comedic twist"".

Granted if your looking for a huge climax or major character development this movie probably isn't for you. If, however, you are looking for the best (and most) one-liners in a movie, and/or worked in the service industry this is definitely your movie. Ryan Reynolds is back to his Van Wilder persona and is funny at times. The funniest line of the movie comes from Dane Cook when hes introduced to the new employee Mitch; with knife in hand: ""Welcome to Thunderdome, bitch."" Dane only has but a few lines but makes the most out of EACH one. SO lets review: more Dane, Faris, and Koechner; a bit less Ryan.

246,Flungo,Worst movie ever made,1,26 February 2006,"""Waiting"" could very well be the worst movie ever made. It is about an Applebee's type restaurant and it's staff. Apparently, it is supposed to be a stereotypical staff for these types of places. The cast is typical of bad movies, featuring such perennial losers as Ryan Reynolds, Andy Milonakis, and Dane Cook. The only decent cast member is Chi McBride. Why he decided to be in a movie as bad as this, I will never know. The whole movie is based on a very sophisticated and sanitary game of men showing other men their genitals and then calling the man a homosexual for looking. This unamusing game serves as the main joke throughout the entire movie. The details of the game are extensive and unnecessary. I guess this was supposed to be some quality, guilty-pleasure, gross out humor, but it was lame and disappointing. I expected much more out of this movie, because the idea of making a movie based in a restaurant is very good. They could have done a much better job, and could have had everyone in the theatre rolling in the aisles. Instead, they left everyone sitting in their seats thinking, ""Are you serious?"" How the writer/director Rob McKittrick convinced somebody to fund this movie, I will never know. As far as I'm concerned, I will never see anything written or directed by him again, and my Ryan Reynolds days are definitely over. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie on a bootlegged DVD.

All the same, similar to the movie, but while the movie is trying to cover more than just the behind the scenes of a restaurant, they could have played on what actually happens behind those doors. There were many more opportunities to place jokes and gags and the movie could have used more actual service industry humor to give bigger laughs and happier watchers. We have all worked at a bar/restaurant/club or at least we have friends that have, and we all know there are much better stories that come out of there, than what was shown in the movie.

The two characters in the movie, Ryan Renolds (Van Wilder: Party Liason, Harold & Kumar go to White Castle and many more) and Luis Guzman (The Count of Monte Cristo) are my favorites. Ryan Renolds brought his Val Wilder type character into this movie. This movies plays on characters that are living their lives between post-high school graduation and college.

Never mess with someone that handles your food. That couldn't sum up the experience better. This is definitely a movie to watch for an easy escape from worldly troubles. Definitely recommended to be purchased on DVD for continual enjoyment. I love that this production thrives on not going for Oscar gold, but was simply made for a release for countless people living the life. Great Movie!",Waiting...

The range of customers that they showed was a great cross-section of the American dining public.My best friend and I went and saw this today - we have worked in the restaurant business going on 20 years - from being waiters, managers, and now owners - and this movie was right on - and left us rolling in the aisle.We are wondering how this will affect the public and their dining experience.

You should go see it asap you will be rolling on the floor laughing in the theater. Each different character no matter how small it is has it's moments, they all make you laugh you A** off. I went to go see it opening night and I am still talking about it a lot, a week later, because it was so funny. I totally say it was worth my $ 8.50, I would have paid even more if I knew that it was going to be that funny. My friends and I even started playing the ""game"" that is mentioned in the movie, I won't spoil it for you though. But make sure you see this!

Most of all, it'll make you think twice about eating at another restaurant or even working at one. Each character is throughly enjoyable as is each interaction between them. It's extremely well-written and realistic. As a waitress, I found it completely therapeutic, because even though I'd never do anything to a customer's food, seeing someone else do it to someone who is deserving of it (even in a movie), is enough to make me feel better. Ryan Reynolds is hysterical in this movie, as is Dane Cook and Luis Guzman. There are so many one-liners that you'll hear for a long time, especially in the kitchen of any restaurant. It ends slightly abruptly and you find yourself wanting more...but I guess that means the writer has done something right. Go see it, and enjoy. Just remember never to break the cardinal rule: ""Never, ever, f*ck with someone who handles your food.""",Waiting...

I felt it could have made better, but hey it's a low budget indie. If anyone has ever worked in a restaurant during high school or college, then you most likely have encountered every scenario portrayed in the movie. And yes, the rumors of getting your food tampered with are not just rumors, but true in many instances. I know for a fact that the kitchen staff or waiters will do funny things to your food if you're obnoxious, but not all the extreme stuff you see in the movie. Kinda funny at some points, and restaurants like that are notorious for hooking up with your co-workers, especially if your still in high school or fresh out of it.",Waiting...

I bus tables part time in a restaurant while finishing school, and i can say that some of the ""cliches"" of a ""normal"" restaurant are present in this film. I love the way it held on to the values of a traditional ""local restaurant"". I found the part where the line cooks becoming upset at the fact that there was a last minute customer EXTREMELY hilarious, because i know that in reality, that happens. That is a perfect example of what i meant by the ""cliches"" of a restaurant. Alothough the characters were over-exaggerated, I found that all characters in the movie have many similarities to the real servers and cooks you see in real life. I just found that the bussers were a little much, as far as their characters go. And i have to give Andy Milonakis HUGE props, because that rap at the end of the movie was just amazing, so well articulated.",Waiting...

The movie lacks a lot of substance which is expected of this type of film, but the content just wasn't funny enough to make me satisfied that I just spent nine bucks. I've been a waitress so relating to some of the material works to the film's advantage, but if you've never been in that business a lot of what does work in the film doesn't do all that it could. Some characters were underplayed (like Dane Cook) while others (you can witness for yourself) were either not strong or memorable enough to carry their brief scenes. I feel that dealing with the inner workings of the restaurant business is a brilliant idea, but this film just never took off. I'd save this film for a rental night.",Waiting...

I'm just freaked out because it TOTALLY reminds me of this movie I saw a few years ago called WAITING! Not only is the title identical, but many other components of the film, such as the lead character and his trainee, are similar. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but Waiting seems to be almost ripped off! Please check it our for yourself, tlareleasing.com. Patrick Hasson's Waiting differs in that the sub plots delve into the restaurant workers personal lives a bit more deeply, while 2005's Waiting revolves almost entirely in the restaurant atmosphere. In the closing of 2005's Waiting, there is text which I did not read, in which Patrick Hasson's Waiting may have been mentioned. I hope this was the case, because the similarities between the films seem more than a coincidence. My only desire is that the inspiration behind this funny film doesn't go unnoticed. Just like Too Wong Foo using Pricilla Queen of the Desert as it's undeniable influence, 2005's Waiting should pay it's props to Patrick Hasson's Waiting of 2000.",Waiting...

Ryan Reynolds does a great job in this movie with his witty humor(Van Wilder), and so does Justin Long (who could forget him in Dodgeball).Also, MTV's Andy Milonakis plays a bus boy with Max Kasch. I must say my favorite for this movie was Dane Cook, with his one liners. This isn't a movie for people who get insulted by sexual comedy easily.

Congrats to Rob McKittrick on your first movie, it is low budget, it is a first effort, it is funny as hell and sure to be a cult classic.There are so many laughs in this movie, I had to watch it twice to absorb everything.

Although it may fail to sustain this belly-aching laughter throughout, hits all the right points when it needs to.I went in to watching this film without a clue of its script and plot. And to be honest when i saw the start i thought it was going to be a disaster. When you see that working at a restaurant is like this! Although possibly fitting an entire weeks events into one night.The whole point in this movie is to show restaurants survive on workers who really don't care about the restaurant but is full of young folk who do it to get paid to fuel there drug and drink fuelled lives through the maiden voyage of life(very philosophical,i know). And it does show that and i can relate to every character in the film.If you want to see a film with plenty of laughs, a realistic plot and all round good fun, then this is the one for you. I'm sure this film will do well when it hits the shores of the UK and will get all my mates to have a watch. I really enjoyed it!!",Waiting...

I rented this movie on the recommendation of some of the kitchen workers at the restaurant where I am a waitress. I should have known better. They said it was ""hilarious"", ""funny as s*#t"", among other ""outstanding"" comments. The only reason I sat through till the end was to wait for the funny parts that were NEVER forthcoming. I did feel that some of the portrayals of the customers were realistic. If people were to see this movie and feel the whole as an accurate portrayal of the waiting profession, which I hope normal people would have the sense to figure out is not the case, I would be out of a job. If you like stupid, mindless ""humor"", see this movie. I feel that it insults a profession that I happen to take very seriously and pride myself on. This movie was a waste of my time and money.",Waiting...
274,notengolegs,Waiting: Goodbye Applebee's,9,25 January 2006,"OK, so this wasn't the highest budgeted movie, and probably not the most advertised, but after watching the special features you find out why. Waiting almost didn't come about a few different times, which is why I think it turned out so well. This movie had a four course meal of comedy! How's that for a stupid pun.In Waiting you are introduced to a fairly celebrity heavy cast. Ryan Reynolds (Ammityville Horror, Van Wilder, etc.) plays the main character Monty. Like most of Ryan's rolls, this character is the popular, witty, funny guy that (almost) everyone likes. From there you have Justin Long, the nerdy guy from Dodgeball, of who plays a still nerdy, but funny smart kid, Dean, who did great in high-school but now waits tables at ""ShenaniganZ."" The movie starts out with a house party where all of the main characters are wasted out of their minds and doing a slew of different drugs to boot. Then the very next day you come to see Monty come in to work to find a new trainee that shadows him throughout the movie. This is where you meet the boss, David Koechner (Anchroman, 40 Year Old Virgin) who also plays the same character he did in previously said movies. Throughout the rest of the movie you meet the rest of the cast, all of which hate their job and treat customers with respect until they get that one customer that doesn't tip, or angers the server, you know, you have probably been that person once. Conflict arises when Dean gets offered the assistant manager position and has an inner battle of whether or not his life is a wasteland, and if he should take the job.Waiting is definitely funny, and with this cast, you couldn't expect much less that what you get. Even though Reynolds plays a predictably type-casted character, it's still a funny predictably type-casted character. Long's character is of the same caliber as the one in Dodgeball, but is a bit less on pansy side. So all-in-all this was well casted. On to the writing. The writer of this movie was also the director, of which both were debuts. Although a lot of the script was taken from the writers real life before Hollywood, it was still great comedy.If you love places with silly crap on the wall like Applebee's and Chili's or any restaurant for that matter, don't see this movie. Well, that might be a little harsh, how about this... Don't be a jerk to your server, because as this movie clearly identifies, something very vomit inducing will happen... to you. Get this movie, watch it, you will enjoy it. If you don't enjoy this movie, then you are that bastard customer that anyone who works in a restaurant, or retail, or anywhere for that matter, hates. So if that is you, tell me where you work, so I can come complain to you about the poor customer service I get, jerk. Waiting gets the ever so great four and a half thumbs up. Now seriously, tell me where you work...",Waiting...

Whenever I get bad customers I just think back to that part where the cook's f*ck with the food. It makes me feel so good! The movie really is therapy. Ya gotta understand, guys, that waiting is no easy feat! It is DAMN hard! So when we screw up or seem distracted do not think that it's because we're lazy asses! It's because we got 5 other tables who need this & that ASAP. It's soooo much more than taking the order and putting it through to the cook. We clean, we help other servers.

Reality is, looking around, hoping the manager didn't see it! The game? There are games played in restaurants to keep the sanity, but I never saw any involving the display of genitalia.

(I won't go into that, but in some instances the movie hit some experiences that I had personal experience with, I wont comment in detail). Any who, knowing my background, I found this movie therapeutic and hilarious. If you have never had a restaurant job, you probably will never go out to eat again, or you will treat your server with a little more dignity. Honestly, are we the stupid ones, or is it the customers that don't read the menu. It's a nice fun film to get some of your friends together and enjoy, not a family film. Don't take all of what occurs in this movie to heart, because we servers don't really do what we want to do most of the time.

278,EnderSambo,A Recipe for Good Comedic Fun,10,29 March 2006,"Here's a recipe for you future comedy writers: Take one comedian quickly on the rise (Ryan Reynolds). Add another up and coming star that has good connections (Justin Long). Throw in a comedian who's been in a recognized series of movies (Anna Faris). Throw them into a script and mix in a veteran comedian (David Koechner), an actor/comedian with a mixed track record (Luis Guzman), a guy who can reasonably play the straight man to these misfits (Chi McBride), and a bevy of good looking women. And for laughs, throw in cult-favorite comedians Dane Cook and Andy Milonakis. Mix them together and you should have a series of immature jokes stringed together with no plot, right?Well...not really. Surprisingly, you get Waiting, which is bound to catch on as a college phenomenon, not just because of its collegey humor, but because of its generally-accepted accurate portrayal of the food industries, which many of these students have worked in. The plot is simple, yet very effective. Justin Long's Dean has an old friend who just graduated college. He looks at himself and his job and contemplates how his life really is. In the meantime, Ryan Reynold's Monty takes new guy Mitch (John Francis Daley) under his wing, sort of, to teach him the ropes...and the ""game"".Dean's story is the plot of the movie, and when they address it, it works well, but the meat and bones of the movie are all the random occurrences that happen outside the plot. This movie would've probably had a harder time catching on without the plot, but not too hard. The random stuff that happens, whether it be Milonakis's Nick and his partner T-Dog (Max Kasch) ""gangsta""ing it out by getting high off the whipped cream in the freezer or the one liners spit out by Dane Cook, at least a good, memorable laugh is guaranteed for everyone, which is a rare feat in most comedies.The real standout of the movie is Guzman's Raddimus. Almost everything he says is hilarious, yet he manages to convey a sense of leadership in the kitchen, even though its usually reminding people of how to terrorize food properly. Chi McBride also stands out as the psychoanalytic dishwasher Bishop, a part which he plays real well. Reynolds and Long work well together as well, as Long cosigns a lot of Reynolds' jokes perfectly, earning an extra laugh.This movie isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a cinematic masterpiece or a movie to analyze hours on end, this isn't for you. But if you want a load of laughs, or just a few good ones, this is a great movie to choose from. It's a comedy that does what it is supposed to do: make you laugh.",Waiting...

However, it will be highly educational for you. It is an exact representation of what goes on in restaurants. I waited tables the whole time I was in college and this movie cracked me up. It's true they always play dumb games in the back and pull tricks on each other and YES we do talk crap as soon as we walk away from the table and YES it is true people will screw with your food. It's like Monty says- She broke the cardinal rule- Never F with the people who handle your food. Waiters do hate foreigners, old people, and women with sticks up there butts. And if you leave a crappy tip, don't come back to that same place for a while, trust me. You WILL be recognized. I loved this movie b/c it has tons of great one-liners and it took me back to my restaurant days. You graduate from college and get a real job and you forget how much fun it really was and what it was really like.

I was looking forward to watching this movie. The trailers looked very funny. I was very threatened by this film in light of my own script, involving the same subject. I have to say that I am a fan of sick, silly, and sometimes gross humor, but this film went a little too far. I thought the film had funny moments, of coarse. However, overall, it missed the mark with me, and I'm usually easy to please. I think there is no real lead character, and if forced to pick one I'd say it's the restaurant. Another problem for me is people who say it's just like working in a restaurant. What restaurant do you work at? I'll admit I've heard and been involved in some sick and crazy stories in a restaurant, but the feasibility of all of the events in the movie happening as quickly as they do...please. No restaurant is so full of wacky high-jinx.

This movie really makes you notice how stupid and mean some customers at restaurants are.The movie is cast very well, the characters are all pretty vanilla but you can tell the actors/actresses really like their parts. Maybe not Oscar material, but definitely fun to watch. Ryan Reynolds is starting to get type-cast in these comedy movies (think Van Wilder, Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, etc). It gets kind of old, though, when all of his lines are meant to be zingers and one-liners. The girls in this movie (Anna Faris, Vanessa Lengies, Kaitlin Doubleday, etc) are definitely easy on the eyes. Justin Long (Dean) does a good job, and the rest of the cast isn't too bad either.",Waiting...
