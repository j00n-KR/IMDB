0,Leofwine_draca,Ridiculous,3,31 July 2021,"SHADOW IN THE CLOUD (2020) plays out like a combination of a couple of famous episodes of AMAZING STORIES and THE TWILIGHT ZONE. It stars Chloe Grace Moretz as an aviatrix hitching a ride on a US bomber in WW2 who becomes convinced that a malignant gremlin has hitched a ride and is now doing its best to destroy both the plane and the crew. Yep, it's a re-run of that classic old Matheson story about the plane passenger and the gremlin on the wing of his plane, except ten times as cheesy and lacking the freshness of that premise.It's tough to find good things to say about this low budget oddity, and Moretz isn't one of them. I appreciate the way her character battles the sexism and harassment of the era, but she's whiny here and hard to like as the protagonist. The story is fast-paced and full of action and spectacle, but also plenty of low grade CGI and a monster (essentially a giant bat-thing) that looks like it's wandered in off an Asylum movie. As time goes on, things get more and more preposterous, with the most ridiculous scene being a bit where Moretz falls out of her plane and lands on an exploding plane beneath her, the force of which blows her back up into her plane again unscathed. It lost me at that point and never recovered.",Shadow in the Cloud
1,SnoopyStyle,somewhere in here,4,5 January 2021,"Flight Officer Maude Garrett (Chloë Grace Moretz) flags down a bomber flying out of New Zealand. She's carrying a box in a top secret mission. The crew is dismissive of her but reluctantly agrees to let her stay due to the secret mission. There's also a Gremlin.There is a good Twilight Zone episode somewhere in here. Only, there are two problems that keep it from being good. The first is non-stop yapping. Of course, that includes the sexism and feminism which everybody is talking about. Let me start with the easier second problem. What's in the box? It needs to connect with the Gremlin. Instead, the movie insists on something which is only important for the final scene. It comes with a whole lot of complicated back story when it would make more sense if she stole something from the Gremlin. Right now, the Gremlin is just a coincidence. It's disconnected to the box or anything in the story. Another problem with the box is that the top secret piece of paper would not hold water as soon as her lies are uncovered. The pilot would ask a superior officer on the ground on how to deal with the situation. The whole thing should be written differently to connect it all to the Gremlin.Back to the first issue, the constant yapping is annoying from all angles. Obviously, Roseanne Liang is making this a feminist movie. I accept that but it's over the top and the constant bickering detracts from the horror aspect. The best horror scenes happen when they shut up and let the silence heighten the tension. These are annoying people and that includes her. She insists on justifying herself which makes no sense in hindsight. She's hiding her lies in the movie and should really just keep quiet. If she's not lying about her situation, it makes more sense for her to be combative with the guys. I also have some minor issues with the filming. When she's upside down under the plane, there's no cinematic reason to flip the shot around. It just highlights how the effect is being done and that it's all fake. There are also the post-crash scenes. They are more a debate presentation than a final action scene. It should be an academic thesis. Does the Gremlin represent sexism? Why is it so interested in the box and her? This is an advocacy piece and a messy movie when it doesn't have to be one.",Shadow in the Cloud
2,nogodnomasters,The Fool's Errand,4,10 January 2021,"The film opens hinting at gremlins as Maude Garrett (Chloë Grace Moretz) forges her way on board an airplane at Aukland Air Base, NZ in 1943. She has a package that is classified and can not be opened and must remain up right. She ends up riding in the lower turret where it is cold and has a gremlin. For the first 52 minutes the film consists of Chloë Grace Moretz talking to the vulgar crew on the radio. This was the good part. Then the film becomes over the top (without William Shatner) as if Asylum was making the film using a lot of very bad green screen. They completely ruined the film. Holding on with one finger?Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Shadow in the Cloud
3,kosmasp,Come shadow fly with me,8,15 May 2021,"I think almost everyone agrees that the lead performance is terrific. And that might even be putting it mildly. Chloe is the one character we mostly concentrate on and it is her that we are ""trapped"" with most of the time. Now the dialog may be offensive at times, but feels real. If the men were to talk differently, you might feel inclined to also feel cheated.While that may not sit well with any PC crowd, it had to be included so the movie feels like it is from a time gone ... although with ""locker room"" talk getting a revive by certain individuals we know that ain't true either. But and that is important, the movie is not about insults - it is about a tough and strong female lead. While she may have motives that could be called cliche - it works for what the movie is trying to do for the viewer. And in the 4k version I watched it also looks phenomenal while doing so ... Great acting all around, even when you just have the voices most of the time! Special effects are more than fine too.",Shadow in the Cloud
4,BA_Harrison,There's something on the wing.,8,21 January 2021,"It seems apt that WWII action/horror Shadow in the Cloud opens with a cartoon, because the film itself is as crazy as any Looney Tunes animation. Put simply, it has got to be the silliest thing I've seen in a long time, but I'm certain that the makers knew what they were doing, the aim being to make a movie that puts pure entertainment value ahead of trifling matters like logic or the laws of physics. I think they succeeded: watch with the right mindset (the trailer lets you know what you're in for), and there's plenty of fun to be had with the insane action and sheer preposterousness of proceedings.Chloë Grace Moretz stars as Maude Garrett, who boards a B-17 bomber unannounced, carrying special orders and a strictly confidential package. The wary crew dump the new passenger into the plane's Sperry ball turret (positioned on the belly of the craft) until after take-off, but the flight doesn't go as planned: Maude has a case of the Shatners, spying a destructive gremlin on the plane's exterior, and the bomber is attacked by Japanese fighters.Through a turn of events that can generously be described as unlikely, Maude becomes trapped in the Sperry, and has to leave via the turret's external door to rescue her baby from the gremlin (did I mention that the 'confidential package' is her infant child?). This requires the plucky gal to crawl along the underside of the plane as it flies at a couple of hundred miles an hour - a feat that would require the upper body strength of a very fit gorilla - all the while avoiding enemy fire. One might imagine it couldn't get any more bonkers, but it does, with Maude falling from the bomber, only to be catapulted back into the plane by the force of an exploding fighter, and then flying upside down to pull the plane out of a nose-dive. Physics schmysics.I think that generally there will be two kinds of reaction from viewers: scoffing and derision from those unable to accept its ludicrousness; and praise from the rest, who see it as a piece of no-holds-barred slice of escapism. I'm in the latter camp: if anything I would have liked it to go even further, director Roseanne Liang dialling up the madness to eleven for the finalé (Moretz duking it out with the injured gremlin after a crash landing seemed like a bit of a let-down after all that had gone before).7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb. Strap yourself in for one seriously wild ride.",Shadow in the Cloud
5,paul_haakonsen,An enjoyable creature feature...,6,1 January 2021,"Well, I must admit that the premise for ""Shadow in the Cloud"" wasn't exactly one that was selling the movie tremendously well for me. But still, it being a new movie and one that I hadn't already seen, of course I found the time to sit down and watch ""Shadow in the Cloud"" from writers Max Landis and Roseanne Liang.And sure, this movie wasn't exactly a movie that encouraged much on the intellectual aspect for the audience. This was, short and simple, a movie where you just lean back and enjoy the ride. Personally, I must say that I was actually surprised with how entertaining the movie turned out to be after all.The storyline is pretty straight forward; a group of air crew stuck inside a B-17 Flying Fortress, while having to deal with both Japanese enemy aircrafts and a pesky gremlin that is gradually taking taking their aircraft apart. And Maude Garrett carries with her a secret.Well, I found the movie to be entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, and I actually had fun watching it. It is one of those movies that you can watch again with some time in between each viewing.Visually then ""Shadow in the Cloud"" was actually quite good, and I must admit that the creature design for the gremlin was actually nice. I liked the design of the creature, and it looked very realistic and had a menacing appearance to it.Chloë Grace Moretz carried the movie quite well with her performance, and definitely had a lot riding on her shoulders, given the fact that she was the primary person seen throughout the vast majority of the movie, whereas the men were delivering audio chatter more than having on-screen appearances.For a movie that takes place aboard the crammed space of a WWII aircraft, then director Roseanne Liang actually managed to deliver a wholesomely entertaining movie.My rating of ""Shadow in the Cloud"" settles on a six out of ten stars. I found it to be an enjoyable movie, and if you get the chance to sit down to watch it, you should do so, especially if you enjoy creature features.",Shadow in the Cloud

7,siderite,"Way over the top, but entertaining. You gotta suspend a lot of disbelief, though.",8,12 September 2021,"I could feel Max Landis' screwy ideas in the script. In fact, he almost went full Tarantino on their ass. Imagine a movie that covers misogyny, plane battles in WW2, monsters, a mysterious package that makes people crazy and an indomitable heroine that can do everything, all in a small plane where every actor other than Chloë Grace Moretz only appears for a few scenes and most conversations are via radio. It's wacky, it's full of action and, if you turn off your brain a little bit, it's very fun!It was a bit weak in the stakes department, considering that our heroine takes all the screen time and therefore cannot die nor can we about any of the others.Bottom line: it will never be the movie you expect it to be, but it is well acted, well constructed and you can see that a lot of soul went into it. Not perfect by any means, but for a Covid movie that reads like a play with special effects, it was great.",Shadow in the Cloud
8,FeastMode,really dumb... but i didn't hate watching it,5,8 June 2021,"There are so many things wrong with this movie. I rolled my eyes many times. Some parts were so dumb that i had to pause the movie in order to process what happened. The entire premise is ridiculous, and so many things that happen are absurd. Whoever made this doesn't understand the most basic laws of physics. And they overdid it with the messagehaving said all that, i was never bored. In fact, i was invested. And there is one, let's call it, subplot. That subplot doesn't seem to fit in this movie at all. And yet it was the most stupidly entertaining aspect of the movie. (1 viewing, 6/7/2021)",Shadow in the Cloud
9,Cineanalyst,Hit-Girl Hits Back,7,21 May 2021,"""Shadow in the Cloud"" is exhilarating and hilarious B-picture pulp set aboard a WWII bomber--part the ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" episode from ""The Twilight Zone"" horror exploitation and part also-exploitation ""Kick-Ass"" (2010) feminism. And, appropriately enough, Hit-Girl herself Chloë Grace Moretz stars. I've been in a bit of a lull as far as my movie viewing goes as of late, subsisting partly on mind-numbing action flicks, and so am heartily pleased that this one has what so many of its stick-in-the-mud, self-important counterparts lack: a sense of humor. I mean, these things are inherently goofy, so have some fun with it.And, girl, does it. I love how it jumps right into the action aboard the plane, and in a movie remarkable in this era to come in under an hour-and-a-half runtime. Lesser filmmakers might've began with the backstory instead of waiting for the proper moment where she could share that story so as to equate abusive men with the gremlin. Great mystery contents in her bag, too, and not just in a Tarantino - ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) sort of way, but one where its eventual reveal underscores the female-empowerment exploitation. The claustrophobic first part is some well-done set-up, forcibly quartered as she is in the ball turret--aesthetically the scrotum of the plane and verbally where she's accosted by the men's misogyny before the entire scenario bursts forth in an ejaculation of gunfire. Yet, it's the absurd climbing under the bomber mid-flight to rescue her package and while under attack, to boot, by both a gremlin and Japanese Zeroes where this one gets both wonderfully exciting and delightfully ridiculous, and the ending is perfect. More movies that want to have some sort of socially-conscious message or promotion of representation of historically disadvantaged groups should do so within a genre picture that's given a trashy treatment.To top it off, Mahuia Bridgman-Cooper's score is terrific. I don't know what '80s-styled synthesizer pop has to do with WWII gremlins, but it works. I have the urge now to re-watch the ""Kick-Ass"" movies just for Moretz moving heroically to music--Adagio in D Minor borrowed from ""Sunshine"" (2007), for the shootout in the first one, and the triumphant sounding of her return avoiding bullets atop a van in the sequel. At the least, it's an effective call back. And, of course, she stops before the action to boldly quip--in this case, ""You have no idea how far I'll go""--never mind that the gremlin would be unlikely to hear it though all the turbulence even if it did understand English. The one-liners are always for the audience. Point for ""Shadow in the Cloud,"" then, over the other action flicks I've seen recently for having learned that much from ""Die Hard"" (1988), or Looney Tunes cartoons, for that matter, that the hero should metaphorically, if not literally, wink at the camera to let us know that they know this is silly and, thus, encourage us to participate in the knowing fun. Look where Moretz's gaze is directed at the end. She knows, we know.",Shadow in the Cloud

11,851222,Kudos to originality,6,31 August 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.Even if ""Shadow in the Cloud"" (2020) was weird it was never boring. Kudos to creators for originality - you have to give a credit to people who invest big money, time and passion to make something not by the book, which ""Shadow in the Cloud"" clearly is. While the ride was weird and left me with a lot of question, and the end it was not boring.Overall, Chloë Grace Moretz absolutely killed it in ""Shadow in the Cloud"" - and uneven but fun, original and weird movie considering its plot and outcome and some stuff that happened. Its the type of movie where you accept the style and have to go with it otherwise it will make no sense.",Shadow in the Cloud
12,westsideschl,Kudos to Chloë,9,22 May 2021,"OK, right off the bat let's give Chloë a bushel full of Kudos for really selling the WASP/WAF (females pilots serving in WWII) tough-as-nails character (even though some of it was a bit overdone fantasy in fighting a human size bat creature). Additionally, a bit of social commentary on how females are treated as sexual objects. Obviously a script to stretch one's reality beliefs. (a.) First, obviously the creature. (b.) As belly turret gunner taking out enemy fighters. (c.) Then woman-handling said mentioned creature. (d.) And, analogous to hand hold rock face climbing she makes her way across an upside bomber going 200mph with mostly hand/toe holds.

13,The-Sarkologist,They Try to do Too Much,4,24 January 2021,"I'm not too sure about this film, it was good, but it really wasn't great, and a part of me feels that maybe it was because they were trying to do too much with the film. Like, basically it is World War II film, that is also a horror film, and they throw in feminist critique as well. Like, it isn't as if I don't appreciate the fact that films like this are exploring the subjugation of women over the ages, but in reality it did felt like it was being forced in part, and it sort of undermined what could have been a pretty good film.I don't want to give too much away, namely because there is a pretty big twist halfway through, but I felt that it was because of this twist, that the premise behind the film was undermined. Like, for instance, based on her resume, I sort of wonder where she learnt how to fire a machine gun, especially since the only planes that she has flown were supposed to be unarmed.So, we have this woman with a mysterious package board a plane at Auckland Airforce base which is bound for Samoa. Of course, being a very testosterone filled plane, the presence of a woman on board is not really welcome, but she has orders so they take off. The problem is that the only place to put her is in the under turret, which is sort of bad luck, but then again having a woman on board was also considered bad luck. During the flight she discovers that they have another passenger, and that is a gremlin, which they also have to deal with. Oh, and it turns out that the Japanese are also in the area.That is the problem with the film, I felt that they were doing a little too much. They could have made it better in a couple of ways, either by dropping the Gremlin and focusing more on the feminist aspect, or they could have kept the contents of the package secret, thus keeping the mysterious nature of the film. In fact, I felt that the big reveal sort of undermined the character, who was being painted as one of those mysterious, and very capable, sort of operatives. Yeah, there are some pretty good points made during the film, but as I mentioned it was a little too much.Also, by keeping the package secret could have given more of a reason as to why the gremlin wanted it so much, though there is a good reason why she was so desperate not to let the package out of her sight, or her possession, and why the airman who looked after the plane did so.Still, it was a pretty good movie, and does explore some pretty salient points, however, as I suggested, there was just a little too much to the film that weakened it somewhat.",Shadow in the Cloud
14,ops-52535,honestly...,6,1 January 2021,"This was so many types of genres that ive lost count, and from radiotheatrical to actional to reactional in a 3 step kind of build up + the gremlins of course.so now we all know what can turn a woman into a devil... its easy, just threaten her baby and youll be barely clinging on to life if youre løcky.but most of all a surprising twisted waraction movie of a waiting game the first half, with lots of mediocre radio chattering female dividending gossip at the fence, the second half is just completely supernatjural at all levels.its a small cast, but its just cloe that gives some effort in this film, nothing extravagant, more as expected from that little lioness.production is fair and square, but total lack of story and -line. its a film that the grumpy old man barely recommends with a weak 6",Shadow in the Cloud
15,cruise01,"Cheesy script, mix mash plot, and entertaining action",6,7 February 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Shadow in the Cloud is a fair action horror film about Chloe Grace Moretz character hitching a ride on a plane with a few soldiers. Needing to deliver a secret package in her luggage. While in the air they face against some gremlin like creature that is destroying the plane and fighting against other enemies that is attacking them in the air.Mix mash plot with a few cat and mouse fight with WWII air battles. Some horror thrills with a creature destroying there plane. While Chloe is locked in a gun cockpit.The script is cheesy with annoying irritating characters.

16,Tweetienator,Too Dead Serious,4,5 January 2021,"Shadow in the Cloud is not that bad - in my view the main trouble of this little flick is the ""dead serious tone"" it got and it feels a bit lengthy here and there. The story itself screams for cheese and bad-taste but instead the director takes the story and the character of the heroin too serious. I mean a baby in a box, some monster crawling on a flying plane, and a WWII scenario, that calls for some serious cheese and schlock and B-movie flair a la Blob or something like that.

18,subxerogravity,"Liked the movie, loved Chloë Grace Moretz in the movie!",5,6 March 2021,"If this movie was about being a vehicle for Chloë Grace Moretz than it was excellent! Not a hard sell for me by a far stretch as I've been a fan of hers snice Kick Ass. Shadow in the Cloud does a good job of showing us what a good actor she is and what a great action hero she can be. A total movie star. She reminds me of Meryl Streep. Maybe I'm reaching too far but I just feel that when I see her, despite the fact that I would love to see her do something that would make her the next Ellen Ripley or something (Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Aliens).As for the movie itself...it's good! I will admit when the movie started out with that generic 80s looking title card, you know the one you seen in Good Time, the Neon Demon and a bunch of other films that seem to celebrate a trend in movies during the early to mid 80s, the one's scored by Tangerine Dream. I raised an eyebrow for a second when I saw that thinking to myself ""is there a free App all filmmakers use that just layers this style on top of your film like it you are posting something on snap chat?Also as the plot goes further, it keeps escalating the ridiculousness and the outrageousness of it all. It got to the point where the film was all about style overall, Felt like certain specials effects done particularly for a look rather than effectiveness, doing things that was easier to get away with in the era the film feels like it's influenced by.However, once you get to the end Shadow in the Cloud leaves a very good taste in my mouth. It's an exciting mixed of action, horror, adventure and Sci-Fi and it showcases what Moretz id capable in theses and all genres.Thumbs way up!",Shadow in the Cloud
19,stevendbeard,WW 2 Creature Feature,7,17 January 2021,"I saw ""Shadow in the Cloud"", starring Chloe Grace Moretz-The 5th Wave, The Equalizer_2014; Nick Robinson-The 5th Wave, Jurassic World; Taylor John Smith-Hunter Killer, Insidious:Chapter 3 and Beulah Koale-Hawaii Five_O_tv, Thank You For Your Service.
This is a WW2 creature feature that reminded me of the old War comics I used to read when I was a kid-you know, with soldiers fighting dinosaurs in them-except it's not dinos here but a gremlin type creature. Chloe plays a female pilot that catches a ride at the last minute on a B_17. She tells the crew that she has top secret documents and they need to get to their destination in a hurry. Nick, Taylor and Beulah are members of the crew. Suspicions start to pop up whenever strange noises and sightings start appearing on board the craft. Is it some sort of gremlin-they were a myth that people used to blame any kind of problems on-tearing up the plane? And the Japanese fighter planes attacking at random intervals isn't helping much, either. A lot of the action is a little on the incredulous side, but then, it is a movie and not a documentary. It was filmed in New Zealand and there is a short animated film at the beginning that is based on the real military cartoons they used as instructional videos that starred a certain private named Snafu. During the end credits, there are some real female pilots shown in vintage footage showing off there stuff.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 23 minutes.
It's a fun joy ride and I would buy it on DVD.",Shadow in the Cloud
20,henry8-3,Shadow in the Cloud,6,4 August 2021,"1943 and Airman Chloe Grace Moretz joins the close knit and deeply mysoginistic crew of a Flying Fortress - she is apparently on a secret mission and holding a parcel that must be guarded at all costs. However also aboard the flight is a rather nasty Gremlin who seems eager to steal the package.What a completely crazy film. If you have any hope of enjoying this you must really, really suspend your disbelief and sit back and enjoy this wild, utter nonsense which mixes a war movie, quite well actually and a polemic against the treatment of women's role in the war effort with a Twilight Zone episode. Moretz does well as the tough girl fighting the verbal abuse from the crew (which is really unpleasant and rather uncomfortable to listen to - was this necessary?) and the creature. There are scenes which stretch the rules of this game a little too thinly (Moretz' contact with an exploding Japanese fighter a case in point - you'll know when you see it) but that aside I thought it was original, rather well produced and destined for cultdom.

Maude (Chloe Grace Moretz) hitches a ride on a B-17 going from Auckland to Samoa, she's carrying secret documents but even though she's a WAAF pilot the crew give her a hard time. She has to go into the belly bubble gun-turret for take off but ends up being trapped there. Then a gremlin, a large bat/rat/ape creature appears and starts damaging a wing and attacking her turret, the crew disbelieve her at first. Much of the action is based in the bubble and the outside of the plane, with the airmen only being heard over the intercom until Moretz gets back into the fuselage. It's not just the monster that they have to fear though, Japanese Zeros also attack. The gremlin is quite convincing as are the hand to hand battles with it and the dog fights with the Zeros. Some of the events do require a suspension of disbelief but Moretz literally kicks gremlin, misogynist and Zero ass. A couple of interesting plot twists makes this into an Air Ace scary pulp story.

Bad movie.,2,24 May 2021,"Suggested alternate title - ""Spider-Woman in the clouds: Baby's day out.""I'll say this much for 'Shadow in the cloud': It immediately makes us hope that all the male crew members die, as soon as the screenwriters can manage it. As each one bites the dust, all I can say is, ""Good riddance.""Maude (Chloë Grace Moretz) does the best she can to fend off the profound ignorance and provocations of her cohorts. It's unfortunate that this defines the first 20 minutes of the movie, coloring our perspective on the feature very early. I'm at least thankful that the screenplay puts Maude in relative isolation for much of the movie - we only have to hear the sexist pigs, and not also look at them.After those first 20 minutes, the suspense and action starts to kick up pretty quickly, with unexpected twists in the plot along the way. It's unspeakably regrettable that this action just as quickly becomes so over the top that I think even Marvel would hesitate to write some of these moments into their ""live-action"" comic book spectacles. Primarily, I refer to (a) Maude climbing upside-down on the wing of the plane, mid-flight and while being harried by enemy fighters; and (b) Maude falling through a hole in the hull, through the air, and on top of an exploding Japanese plane, with just the right timing that the force of that explosion throws her back into her plane through the same hole.What?Ah, and then there's the guitar-heavy rock music, and industrialized electronic beats, that characterize the soundtrack. Once again, so very over the top - to the point that I'd rather, say, the soundtrack of 'Thor: Ragnarok' consisted of nothing but ""Immigrant song,"" on repeat, than to hear the preposterously anachronistic mess that film-makers decided was appropriate here.I like Chloë Grace Moretz; I think by now she's proven her skills as an actress, including in action-heavy roles. But the demands of green-screen silliness and writer-director Roseanne Liang's apparent push for high-octane absurdity mean that once the action kicks into ridiculous overdrive, the film requires the same of Moretz. It's frankly kind of demoralizing to see, especially when within this same movie - during less hectic moments, or at the very end - we bear witness to acting that is distinctly more heartfelt, from her and for us.There were actually some good ideas here, ones that I'd have liked to see explored. They are all but consumed by the drive for Action, Action, Action. The more 'Shadow in the cloud' pushes for nonsense in its narrative, the less likable it becomes. For that matter, if Liang had written this film without those two particular superhero-worthy moments I've described, then those omissions alone may actually have been enough to make this an okay movie otherwise.In fairness to Liang, though - I didn't realize until I had already begun watching that this was co-written by Max Landis (...ew). Had I known, I probably wouldn't have watched it in the first place, both on account of who he is, and the other ho-hum movies I know he's been responsible for.I just have so many regrets right now.I anticipated enjoying 'Shadow in the cloud.' The premise reminded me of the 2002 film 'Below,' which I rather liked. But this was a terrible instance of mounting problems: the name in the credits, the boorishness of most of the characters, the hogwash of the action, the annoyingly bombastic soundtrack, and the way all these things converged to force Moretz into a performance that's beneath her. Put all that together, and what worth there may have been in this picture just evaporates into intangible vapor.If senseless action films are just what you're looking for, then good for you, and you've come to the right place. But if you're hoping for something a bit more fulfilling, then run away. Far, far, away.",Shadow in the Cloud
27,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Interesting Lore and Premise, but Falls a bit Flat",6,30 March 2021,"This was a movie that intrigued me when I saw that it was coming out. I like period piece horror movies and this one is set during World War II. There is also this interesting aspect of it being a potential creature feature with lore that was used about gremlins and how they would destroy machinery during this era. Plus I'm also a fan of Chloë Grace Moretz as well. This was originally going to be my first horror movie of 2021, but it had a stiff price tag to rent. Now that it has come down, I finally gave it a viewing. The synopsis here is a female WWII pilot traveling with top secret documents on a B-17 Flying Fortress encounters an evil presence on board the flight.Now the synopsis shies away from there being a creature, but the movie itself doesn't. We get a cartoon, which turns out to be a real one for the era that explains a bit about the lore. It was believed that there were gremlins that would destroy machinery and the cartoon is explaining that in reality, it was the laziness or the lack of care when doing their work. It is really trying to explain to keep your area clean, take pride in your work and there won't be any mishaps.We then learn that we're on Auckland Air Force Base back in 1943. Maude Garrett (Mortez) has her arm in a sling and is carrying a top secret document. She gets on board of a plane by the name of The Fool's Errand, which is interesting for how this movie plays out. Her getting on board makes the crew very uncomfortable. I think part of this is her being a woman and the other part is that they were not notified. They do accept it as an important, high ranking officer seemed to have signed off on it. There isn't a place for her so the top secret package she is carrying is kept in the cockpit with Walter Quaid (Taylor John Smith) and goes down in the Sperry turret underneath the plane.They take off and Maude can hear all of the chatter from the crew on the communication system. It is through this that she learns who each one is as they talk dirty about her. Stu Beckell (Nick Robinson) is the tail gunner. Anton Williams (Beulah Koale) is the co-pilot, John Reeves (Callan Mulvey) is the pilot, Terrence Taggart (Byron Coll) is the communications officer, Bradley Finch (Joe Witkowski) is the navigator and Tommy Dorn (Benedict Wall) is the worst with his mouth. She shuts them up when she responds to what they're saying.Things get worse for her when she thinks she sees a creature on the underside of the wing. She tries to warn them, but no one believes her. Another of the crew sees an enemy plane, which she also sees. It turns out that she is right and she is quite skilled with the turret. Not everything about her though is true. She gets trapped in the Sperry and attacked by the creature. The men don't trust her and push for the truth. It is hard to believe her when she has lied about some things. When their plane starts to fall apart, is the creature we keep seeing real or lack of proper maintenance catching up with the plane?That is where I want to leave my recap for this movie as I don't want to spoil it as this movie is still fairly new. To start breaking it down, I'll get into what I like for. I'm not surprised to see that a woman directed this. There is a bit of empowering here since we do have Maude who is part of the air force. I wasn't sure if they were allowed into this branch of the military, but then seeing that they were in New Zealand, I was bit more forgiving since I don't know all of the history there. From the footage at the end of the movie though, it does seem like they were allowed into the air force in some capacity. This movie really does have a social commentary on misogyny, which makes sense. I do think the movie goes a bit over the top with it, but to be honest, it probably isn't. It is hard for me to judge as a male since I do not experience it. This movie was set in a different time and let's be honest, we really haven't come that far or at least as far as we should. What I will say as a negative here, there is a reveal here that I think sets the character back and I think they could have come up with something better personally.What I also really like about this movie is the idea of the creature. One of my earliest memories of gremlins is from the classic Gremlins and its sequel. What is interesting is in that movie, Mr. Fudderman brings the lore that this movie has. They are creatures that get in your machines and destroy. In that classic he blames the Japanese for putting them in there, of course. It is also interesting is that I heard a review on Exploding Heads Horror Movie Podcast where they paired this up with the different version of The Twilight Zone episode, Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. I can see why they did the pairing as this does seem to borrow at least some from that source. This is something that I wish they would have focused on a bit more.The last part of the story I want to delve into is Maude geting stuck. She's told to leave the Sperry, but when she pulls on the handles, they break-off. She does get a bit panicky, which I can't blame here there. This also seems to be a bit of a plot device. She is trapped down here while the creature is attacking the ship. It does make the focus more on her. The men are only voices that we are hearing. I don't mind this to an extent actually. I also think it limits what they can do as well.Where I think I'll go next would be the acting. As I've already been alluding to, this movie is really on the back of Moretz is acting. I think she's solid here. As I've said already, I'm a fan of her in general. She does well here as this strong woman who is attractive enough and deals with all of these men acting like children. Robinson is fine as Beckell. I'd say the rest of the guys are mostly just voices. They do well with making distinct characters which is all I can ask for.Then really the last thing I want to go into here would be the effects. There were quite a few times that I could tell they were using green screen. It is what it is as it would be tough to do this practical so I'm forgiving there. The creature for the most part is fine. Another thing that doesn't look great, but I like its design. My biggest issue is there is something that happens here where Maude is moving around underneath the plane while it is moving. I don't believe it could happen as it does here. It is going a bit slower as it is losing altitude. I'm not up on the physics or if it is possible, but I don't buy it at this time and it took me out of the movie.In conclusion here, this movie has a really good premise and I like the set that we get here. Moretz is solid enough actress to carry this movie with the misogynistic men there holding her back. I even like the reveal of the creature and what becomes a major part of the tension. My problem is that what they focus on for this movie hurts it. It also seems to be setting back women with some of these reveals later in the movie. The effects though are solid enough, but I don't know if I buy the climax personally. The soundtrack is fine where the sound design I would say is actually really good as well. Overall I would say this is just over average for me due to the things I have issues with. A few different things though and they could have had something really good here in my opinion.",Shadow in the Cloud
28,Kamurai25,"""Duck, Duck, Bat""",8,19 June 2021,"Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.Sometimes it is a really great thing to go into a movie with extremely low expectations, and I certainly went into this thinking it's going to be boring. That's its a WW2 courier movie, but it really is so much more.It honestly feels like this is a collection of stories that are all stitched together in a fantastic way. It's modular storytelling, and while it's a trend I've been noticing in the beginning of the 2020's this goes above and beyond. It's almost a 5-act movie, but each act is it's own 3-chapter act. They nailed the writing in this so that it is both powerful and captivating.It's not just a WW2 story (though that's the setting), it's not just a woman's story, it's not just a hero vs evil story, it's not just a captive / isolation story, it's not just a combat story: it's really all of these and more with some great cinematography to enhance it all the way though.This is definitely worth the watch, and don't let any aspect of ""I heard it was an x movie"" stop you.There is something for everyone here, and it's all good.",Shadow in the Cloud
29,arungeorge13,"Not as terrible as most reviews say, but not mind-blowing either! [+57%]",6,9 January 2021,"A misogynistic flight crew, a confidential package, a wounded-but-skilled female flight officer (Chloë Grace Moretz), and even a CGI gremlin take centre stage in Shadow of the Cloud, written by Max Landis, and directed by Roseanne Liang. This a film that fully acknowledges its B-movie facets and accordingly plays its cards well. The first act is almost all Moretz, where the character she plays has to listen to the sexist drivel that the dudes onboard keep hurling at her. It's the claustrophobia, some level of mystery (right from that smoggy opening scene set to a synth score, preceded by a cartoonish forewarning about gremlins), and our imaginations being put to work through roughly exchanged dialogue that sustains interest.When the CGI gremlin shows up, the B-movieness is amped up several notches. Now, more than surviving the high-altitude onslaught of Japanese fighter planes, the horror also gets in our face. By the film's second act, it becomes obvious that you're in for a logic-free but outrageously engaging modern actioner where you'll see Moretz's character perform the stunts usually executed by an Ethan Hunt or a Harry Tasker. Director Roseanne Liang, in fact, fires on all possible cylinders when it comes to ticking off WTF moments. In a crisp 80 minute film, the horrors faced by the leading lady are three-pronged. She's stuck in the Sperry with a bunch of hostile machomen on board (with the exception of one, the reason for which is revealed later in a twist), the Japs want to take the plane down, and of course, there's the ugly-looking gremlin that frequently shows up.Moretz delivers both the vulnerable-woman-on-board vibes and the action-hero goods in style, occasionally going over-the-top as the situation demands. When you perceive it from an action-flick standpoint, there isn't a dull moment and all the action unfolds rapidly. Yet, there are instances like that final showdown (a fist-fight of sorts) between the protagonist and the gremlin (and some atrocious musical score during a set-piece) that truly made me sigh. All said and done, Shadow in the Cloud isn't as terrible as many reviews might say. It isn't the greatest B-movie (or even close to that), but one thing it manages to do is entertain. And that it does in a marginally impressive way!",Shadow in the Cloud
30,Abdulxoxo,Quite enjoyable,6,20 February 2021,"Ok first, let's address the elephant in the room - Chloe Grace Moretz. She was the glue that held the film together. She's physically capable and also delivered her lines convincingly during emotional moments. I actually cared for her character despite having little development. The rest of the film, however, I don't care about it. The structure of the story could have been better; the first act relied heavily on dialogue - much of which were nonsense and hard to sit through. There were many cheesy and hard-to-believe scenes ( that bouncing back into the plane bit). Characters seemed to teleport from one place to another. Another issue is that, there absolutely wasn't any explanation of any sort as to the origin of the ""gremlins"" and how they get to the plane in the first and also why they want what's inside the bag. However, I found this movie to be enjoyable as there are some action sequences that were fun to watch.The technical elements of this film was very good. The choice of music is odd for a movie that's set in the 1940s but it, nevertheless, fits the atmosphere of the film very well. Special effects were serviceable. The lighting was fantastic. The camera work was slick. Loved the tight runtime of the film too.Overall, this movie worked in most parts because of Chloe's strong performance and good technical aspects. The script, tho left much to be desired.",Shadow in the Cloud
31,NijazBaBs,better than Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,5,20 February 2021,"All I can compare this to is Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004) to which it is similar, but better because shorter - not time waster, more clear, and more real. But besides that, it is also unrealistic, and too much talk. Maybe not more than 50% talk, but close to that. So this deserves 50% rating. Good is the action of woman in the air, takes courage and many positions and skills for which physical fitness is required. Then good environment which is air, airplane, nature. Good weapons, reminds me of video games like Battlefield. Also good intro where her position is so cool, almost like she is in clouds or in a dream. So this movie is closest to dream because of such rare position. But bad is the intro which starts suddenly, then too much talk especially the filthy one, and unrealistic being. Besides being unrealistic it looks also not that scary or interesting. Story makes no sense, too unrealistic, sudden, and no purpose. Just shows some random common stuff like jokes, caring for baby, love...but so fake and short lived. Was there not some good stunts, weapon, environment, this would be much worse or worst rating. Overall I am not satisfied except for the few stunts and skills. Story is the worst. And bit hot woman or her makeup or her skills (acting or fighting).",Shadow in the Cloud
32,IonicBreezeMachine,A well made lean and efficient high concept B-movie that entertains in spite of silliness.,7,6 May 2021,"In August 1943, Maude Garrett (Chloe Grace Moretz), a female Flight Officer, is assigned to travel with top secret documents from Auckland, New Zealand, to Samoa aboard a B-17 bomber christened the Fool's Errand. The bomber's crew gives her a mostly derisive welcome, and she is quartered in the Sperry (belly gun or ball turret) for the takeoff. With no room left for her document bag, she reluctantly allows the only crew member friendly to her, Walter Quaid (Taylor John Smith), to store it. Now airborne, Maude faces not only casual misogyny and sexism from the Fool's Errand's abrasive crew, but also enemy fire from Japanese fighter planes and possibly creatures thought by airmen to be myths.Shadow in the Cloud marks the latest (and presumably last) feature film to be scripted by Max Landis. Directed and co-written by Roseanne Liang, Shadow in the Cloud tries and mostly succeeds at being a female empowerment story while also juggling the genre mashup stories that have defined Landis' brief career. In this case the movie plays a bit like Locke, From Dusk til Dawn, and the Heavy Metal segment ""B-17"" and despite its potential for cluttered storytelling, the movie at 75 minutes long uses its limited location to good effect and makes an enjoyable claustrophobic and tense thriller that does sometimes strain credibility.Moretz is absolutely fantastic in the lead as Maude who often in the movie is the only one on camera. Once Maude goes into the Sperry, we don't leave it until around the 50 minute mark so with a lessor actor this wouldn't have worked. The only contact Maude has is via the B-17 intercom as she takes the casual sexism of the flight crew in stride because there's no other alternative. The movie effectively uses its contemporary attitude towards women in conjunction with its naturally claustrophobic interior to create some amazingly tense moments in the first 50 minutes because while Maude does have weapons, they are unreliable and sometimes can't aim at their target. Director Liang gives a good sense of the geography of the plane and anything that can be done with its limited location is done.The movie eventually after the 50 minute mark does go into sillier areas that although well done will test the suspension of disbelief for many viewers. I myself was willing to suspend my disbelief, but a scene involving a ""lucky explosion"" made me audibly yell ""bs"" at good fortune that borders on divine intervention. Most of the crew don't have much defining them aside from basic types (level-head, tightly wound, jokester, rookie, etc.) and for the most part you'll be bale to guess who's making it out alive. Being a lower budgeted independent production the movie doesn't go for many ""wow"" moments, but the effects by the reliable Weta Digital do good work to recreate the ariel battle sequences and creature effects.Shadow in the Cloud is a silly but sincere high concept B-movie that uses to a limited location to maximum effect. The story is simple but effective and headlined by a strong performance from Chloe Grace Moretz, and while the third act stretches suspension of disbelief a tad too far it's still an enjoyable mashup of war, horror, and action.",Shadow in the Cloud

38,kjproulx,Too Much Schlock Makes it Difficult to Enjoy,6,14 September 2020,"These days, calling something a B-Movie is almost like saying it gets a pass for being a poor film, and while I don't believe that, there are moments in the film Shadow in the Cloud that the filmmakers clearly wanted you to turn your brain off for. I've been a fan of Chloe Grace Moretz as an actress for many years. From her fun roles like Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass or her incredibly committed dramatic performance in Hugo, she showed that her range was capable of going much further. Not knowing anything about this movie, I banked on the lead actress and the premise being fun enough, but I think I got much more than I bargained for. Here's why this film was both great and terrible all at once.After sneaking on board a plane for mysterious reasons, Maude Garrett (Chloe Grace Moretz) will stop at nothing to protect her classified cargo. Taking place in a single area of the plane for the entirety of the first and second acts, Shadow in the Cloud held my attention very much. Where this film began to lose me was in the very, very over-the-top crew members she had to speak to throughout the film. The level of obnoxiousness was far too much for a movie like this and then the final act hit and it honestly became a completely different movie. It's been a while since I've seen a film switch gears as hard as this one did.Having just premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, I'm trying to wrap my head around how they're even going to market this film to the average moviegoer. For the most part, it takes place in a single location, and when it leaves that location to become a completely different movie, it sort of ruins the shock value of the final act to actually include that stuff in a trailer. Having no idea what this movie was before going in, I must say that I went through numerous emotions throughout. From being invested in the drama in the first act to raising an eyebrow for where it's about to go, to being completely taken out of the movie by the ridiculously over-the-top finale, it's going to be very hard to recommend this one to anyone.Chloe Grace Moretz gives a damn good performance here, having about 95% of the movie to herself. By the third act, this movie just straight-up becomes a cartoon and I just thought to myself that she is far too good for a movie like this. Maybe the filmmakers knew exactly what movie they were making and knew that they wanted to create some schlock to close out the movie, but Shadow in the Cloud in turn just feels like a bunch of random ideas smashed into one film. I'm truly not sure who the audience for this film will be.In the end, it's very clear that writer/director Roseanne Liang set out to make some obvious messages throughout the movie, which is what I feel the whole film was going for, but I thought it was way too heavy-handed, especially for the popcorn movie it becomes by the end. The best thing I can say about this film is that the central performance is great and the film is never boring, as it's 83-minute run time does fly by. The problem is that this movie evolves into something that's just too much for itself to handle. I got a huge kick out of certain elements, which is enough for me to give the film a passing grade overall, but it's not a great movie by any means. There are things to have fun with, but the over-the-top nature is simply overdone.",Shadow in the Cloud

I would be pretty surprised if she doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination in the next ten years. While it's true that her choices don't always end up being good movies, she's rarely the one to blame when things don't work out. In Roseanne Liang's film, she's undoubtedly the glue that holds everything together. Moretz perfectly handles what it's close to being a solo movie - she's literally stuck inside a tiny turret - demonstrating extraordinary emotional range.For most of the runtime, the viewers are placed inside a claustrophobic place, watching the protagonist communicate through radio with the other crew members, who so happen to be extremely sexist, annoying male characters. While I do understand the intent behind this character archetype, it becomes so on the nose that it almost makes the director and her co-writer, Max Landis, the ones who seemingly never met any other type of army men. The narrative holds so many distinct ideas that go from a monster flick to a war drama, and their balance is all over the place, just like the score (Mahuia Bridgman-Cooper).Once the mystery surrounding her package is revealed, and the action sequences start taking the front stage, the story takes a huge leap into the utterly absurd. From one of the most shockingly hilarious uses of an airplane explosion to the unbelievability of everything that happens in the third act, it isn't easy to shut down my brain when the film until that point was going more for the grounded depiction of how it is to be an isolated woman in the Air Force than a straight-up sci-fi/monster/action flick.Despite all that, I can't deny its entertainment value and the exceptional lead performance.Rating: B-",Shadow in the Cloud

Let alone representing what its really about and without spoiling anything. Maude (Chloe Grace Moretz) jumps aboard a WW2 New Zealand army plane at the last minute with orders from the brass and a mysterious package. She doesn't read the rest of the flight crew in and with cramped quarters, she's forced into the lower gunner seat. She gets stuck in there and as the flight slowly devolves into chaos (for a variety of reasons), she must defend not only the flight crew but fight off the mystical as well as the enemy while trying to survive.

Just know that I can't really do it justice without spoiling it and while the conclusion isn't shocking, how they get there is pretty crazy.This is a showcase for Chloe Grace Moretz. We do meet the other characters but we only get a scene or two with them (mainly at the beginning and the end). Their contributions are mainly in ADR or voice over. I can't say Chloe shone brightly in this but she's still one of the better aspects of Shadow. She's talented and she does what she can with a character that's caught in a hurricane of weird and daunting events. The material doesn't do her any favours but she does a good job all things considered. So does the rest of the cast, they're also victims of the lopsided material (the ""aggressive cat calling"" gets a little tiresome, only 1 of them has any compassion or even passive feelings towards Maude) but they aren't supposed to be subtle or have any nuance.I tried to ride the crazy train that is Shadow in the Cloud. I was never in love with this movie but it was almost impossible to look away from. It plays it so straight while Maude is shooting down enemy planes and is simultaneously attacked by mythical creatures. But when we make the switch from the bottle movie we begin with to the action movie it wants to morph into, it doesn't just quietly slip off the tracks. It jumps off a ramp into a gigantic pile of nonsense. I can't endorse this as ""great filmmaking"" but I did have to know what happened next.I don't want to contradict all the hate being spewed at this movie by other reviewers on this site. Shadow doesn't make sense, it doesn't focus on helping the audience understand or even seem to care if it loses you in the process. The screenplay has severe tonal shifts, a wilful disregard for the rules (science, logic, anything else?) and it wraps up way too neatly for such a messy final act. But after the first 10-15 minutes, Shadow never stops being balls-to-the-wall insane, its got a short run time and its very watchable in the strangest way. I can't recommend it outright but it is a uniquely beastly combination of a movie and if you're looking to watch something ""different"", this fits that bill.",Shadow in the Cloud

45,trinaboice,Ridiculous but still kind of fun,4,4 January 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This quirky film is part horror, action, fantasy, and war movie. And yes, of course, it's another movie about female empowerment. Some critics are describing the movie as pulp ridiculousness, yet still a fun ride. They're right.If you're looking for realism, skip this one. If you want mindless nonsense to distract you from Covid and are willing to suspend your disbelief, here you go!TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Tons of profanity and F-bombs
Super crude, sexist language, and conversations
You see a baby nursing on a woman's breast.
THEMES:
Anti-sexism
Tenacity, persistence
Infidelity
Being proactive
MotherhoodTHINGS I LIKED:
I've always been a fan of Chloe Grace Moretz. She does a great job in this crazy film and is perfectly suited for the role with her physicality from Kick-Ass and natural appeal. She looks great and gave a fierce performance. The majority of Acts 1 & 2 feature only Chloe in the small belly gunner of an airplane communicating with the rest of the crew over an intercom system. I wondered if the entire movie was going to be that way, but Act 3 really opens up.
I loved the cartoon announcement opener, in the beginning, to really give you a sense of watching the movies during WWII in America.
It's delightfully unpredictable.
It's impressive how anyone can make a movie in such tight spaces.
The airplane is appropriately named ""The Fool's Errand.""
Keep watching during the rolling credits to see real footage of female pilots during the war and in later decades. During WWII, the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) was created by the Air Force providing female pilots to fly fighters, bombers, spotters, and non-combat transporters.
It made me laugh to see the look on the faces of the guys when they see her do something super fierce and crazy as if they are actually afraid of her because she was such a bada$$.
A lot of World War II movies use color grading that is desaturated and this one does too, giving it a look of a much older film.
The film does a great job building tension until it becomes laughable.
Fun fact: There is a real Maude Garrett in the entertainment industry but the movie is not based on her. Her name was used because it sounded old-fashioned and fitting for the time period.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There is a lot of screaming that will make you laugh.
Chloe's British accent isn't very good and I was rolling my eyes, but then you learn later on in the story why that's so and I actually bought it.
The music is super annoying at one part of the movie which completely distracted me and pulled me out of the film.
The crude language and dialogue are extreme and even downright offensive and exhausting.
The special effects are not that great and you can actually tell when green screens have been used in certain scenes.
There are quite a few over-the-top action scenes that are just laughable.
The plot is absurd.
The reveal of what's in the top-secret box was disappointing and ridiculous.
The movie completely disregards the law of physics.
You'll laugh AT the movie more than WITH the movie.
Max Landis was completely distanced from the film due to the sexual harassment allegations made against him. The screenplay was heavily rewritten by the director, Roseanne Liang.",Shadow in the Cloud
46,destroyerwod,I should had been bored but i was not? Weird...,6,28 April 2021,"I was expecting a monster movie, some giant bats attacking a plane and Chloe as the lead, sound good. Thing is, its not really that much of a monster movie. Most of the movie you actually have Chloe's character (Maude) sitting in a gunner bubble and there is dialogues between her and the other characters. Espescially considering i had a bunch of beer and just wanted some B movie monster action non sense, i should had been bored to death yet time flew by fast and i can't say i was.So this is really weird, because i wanted a good action movie with monsters, this is not what i got (yes there is a monster, but its very secondary), yet i kinda had a fun time anyway? So ill give it an above average rating. Guess Chloe is just able to carry movies because the rest of the cast i didn't care much. You don't see too much of them anyway to be honest.",Shadow in the Cloud
47,jordan2240,I wonder how much money was wasted on this...,4,13 July 2021,"With the special effects, this film had to be expensive to make. I tuned in hoping it would be mindless, popcorn, entertainment. I did have some popcorn, but it was beyond mindless, and entertaining only in its stupidity. Someone set out to make a 'look at how strong women are' film, and forgot to put together something that made any sense whatsoever.I realize actors are just people who are doing a job, and they have to work, so won't blame them for participating in something like this, but unless the editing completely changed what the movie was supposed to be, you have to wonder why some of them didn't question much of the script and premise.If you watched this with friends, you'd all sit around afterward discussing all of the stuff that made no sense, and it could keep you occupied for a while.",Shadow in the Cloud

Compared to all the straight crap that's been coming out, this wasn't that bad. Yes some scenes were definitely unrealistic. Like the part when she crawls across the bottom of the plane upside down holding a baby in a leather box. Nevertheless, in the end I thought it was a decent action/suspense film. 6 stars",Shadow in the Cloud
50,sweidman-28016,"Crazy, Confusing, and Just Everything",6,25 January 2021,"""You have no idea how far I'll go!""So I watched Shadow in the Cloud. Going in I had the basics down. It follows female WWII pilot traveling with top secret documents on a B-17 Flying Fortress who encounters an evil presence on board the flight. That description is completely accurate. However, no one told me how crazy this movie was going to be. The first half really had me engaged. Since we're secluded with Chloë Grace Moretz as Maude for 40 minutes, we can get a great feel for her. I did like her character and she showcased some pretty good acting that I haven't seen from her before. Also, the script is good during that time. Sometimes it could be hard to decipher who all was talking over the intercom. During that time with Maude, there's a several other men on board, but we only really know them through the intercom. Briefly do we get to know their faces before not seeing them again till halfway through. For only hearing their voices, their characters have a clear motive and personality - mainly for us and Maude to get frustrated with.At the halfway mark, things start to get out of hand. A reveal is made that throws the vibe off a bit. I could get behind it after a few minutes as little sense as it made. Then everything completely goes off the rails. By now, we had a couple scenes that weren't meant to be taken seriously, but they took that to a whole new level. Rather than what we think it is, it turns into a B-horror/action movie. The events are nonsensical, the gore becomes more frequent, the CGI is horrendous, needless to say it's just crazy. There's a certain charm to it, though, that makes it extremely entertaining and comedic. Several scenes actually had me laugh-out-loud but in a good way. The whole aesthetic of that second half feels so lovely paying homage to those cheesy b-horror movies from the 70s and 80s. Even the score has a synth sound and the cinematography is dark with neon colors popping out. I really liked those aspects. As much fun as I had, I do really wish they had stuck to one tone. Had the switch from ""this is a serious movie"" to ""you don't have to take this seriously"" weren't so awkward, I would've liked it a lot more. Right now, even after over a week since watching, I still feel indifferent, but I think I liked what I watched. Shadow in the Cloud is really interesting in its approach that will make you either really like it, hate it, or feel pretty indifferent just like me.",Shadow in the Cloud

I remember loving those Looney Tunes cartoons and to see it in real live I thought it would be so cool. But the falling out of the plane screen was unbelievable and the walking on the side of the plane was far fetched. But is that not what movies are all about? Letting you look at things from an imaginary point of view? Yes, there was a LOT of male bashing but being a big fan of Chloe; I have to say she acted like always incredible and I was very interested in the parts of the movie. Even when it got to slow for me it would turn around and action would ensue. I think we can ALL say we have seen worse movies in 2020! At least this one had action and a point of view that women can do it ALL apparently. I give out 10's if I am just wowed by a movie but this one got a 9 because I love the main actress and because at times it was unbelievable. An honest review! I think Chloe is doing a great job still and I cannot wait to see what she brings to the table next <3",Shadow in the Cloud
53,stevenrotherforth,The audience will immediately sniff out a rat!,4,15 January 2021,"'Shadow in the cloud' is all over the place.
It's an absolute mess of a movie that does have some flashes of brilliance.
Sadly those flashes are few and far between as the script, which probably made sense in its first draft, seems to have gone through so many rewrites it's a million miles away from the original concept.
The audience will immediately sniff out a rat and realise that this film went through all kinds of development hell. You get the feeling that this wasn't an organised production.Set in World War II a young female pilot played by Chloe Grace Moretz boards a plane carrying a package of high importance.
Whilst onboard she and the crew encounter an evil presence.
This movie is absurd and unfathomable!
But that's the fault of the director, script writers and editors not doing their jobs properly.
There's absolutely no cohesion. We the audience are left guessing why, what and how things are happening.
The evil presence is in the form of a Gremlin like creature. This is never really explained except from some weird cartoon at the beginning of the movie. This doesn't transfer into the films real life setting or allow the movies premise to be remotely believable.
Of course I accept that this is fiction but come on give me something to work with here!
More negatives arrive in the form of the male cast who all come across as total butt holes!
Not one of them is likeable.Those flashes of brilliance I mentioned earlier are in the form of some impressive action set pieces.
The ariel dog fights are good if a tad far fetched.
The particular scene where Moretz's character is thrown back into the plane after an explosion is unintentionally laughable. As is the scene where she crawls along the underbelly of the aircraft mid flight. Still it is rather gripping and entertaining.
CGI isn't too bad either. The Gremlin like creature looked effective in low light scenes.
Also Moretz's performance is very good and carries the movie. This young actress is more than believable in an action starring role.In terms of how the movie looks and sounds I think this film had a pleasing image quality. Even in 1080p it is slightly soft but still packed with detail.
Colours pop and scenes with the sun on the horizon get eye squintingly bright.
The look of the movie reminded me of 'Overlord' another World War II/ horror movie but one that is far superior.
Sound design has all the punch in all the right places.
Explosions and gunfire have real authority.
Dialogue is front and centre and always intelligible.
Surround channels do their job to keep the audience in the heart of the action.
Not a bad mix at all.So to Sum up 'Shadow in the cloud' is a thankfully short movie that has been hacked to pieces by numerous rewrites, poor editing and a director who didn't know what the hell type of movie they were making.
All the trimmings of the movie are well presented in terms of special effects, image and audio quality.
Shame then that the meat and potatoes of the movie (the story) has been over cooked and pushed around on the plate too many times resulting in a mushy mess.
If this is a sign of things to come in 2021 it's going to be another terrible year.",Shadow in the Cloud
54,TwistedContent,Flawed Exploitation Enjoyment with a Solid Main Performance,5,2 January 2021,"""Shadow in the Cloud"" has the honor of being the first major movie release of 2021, on the very first of January, and it was very welcome as far as I'm concerned. It is an often choice for studios to drop the movies they don't have a lotta faith in early in the year, and, as expected (courtesy of the so-so trailer), ""Shadow in the Cloud"" is a flawed adventure, but an entertaining one. To me it seems that critics woke up in such excellent spirits that the flaws are easier to assign less weight to, and the general audience is getting hanged up on gender problems of this film, a film that doesn't demand an in-depth analysis or much arguing. It is someplace inbetween, where this shlocky B voyage lands itself.Flight Officer Garrett (Chloe Grace Moretz) has a secret mission, and an assignment to join Captain Reeves's team on his plane, aptly named ""The Fool's Errand"". Guys are, of course, shocked seeing a woman climb on-board, and for much of the movie, ""Shadow in the Cloud"" will poke a lot of fun at men being stupid and naughty, wherein lies the bothers of all those 1/10 reviews. As the crew is making peace with their newest addition, they put her in the ""aquarium"" or the small cockpit with big guns under the plane. This is where we'll spend first half of the film, the set-up a.k.a. the better part of the film.Full disclosure, ""Shadow in the Cloud"" is hardly ever realistic or very hard on serious social commentary, it's a B-kind of shlock horror, just without much horror in this case, but the mechanics of the world are comic-book worthy, and, as a sum, it is mostly self-aware popcorn fun, infused with women-empowering lead like many exploitation flicks in the decades before this.And so ""Shadow in the Cloud"" has just enough fun, somehow mostly exactly when camera doesn't leave Chloe stuck in that cockpit for the first two acts. The plot, however slowly and shallowly, develops from there, through the commendable acting of Chloe Grace Moretz. Such a solid performance definitely deserved a better movie, but it also helps a worse one. Say what You will, but she's a fine actress. So, carrying a lot of emotion and not very surprising twists, she fights jokesters and gremlins, the latter of which ultimately has very little place and meaning in ""Shadow in the Cloud"". The horror element rests. The third act is all bullets, explosions, fights and deaths, but it's also the least surprising and least tense act. Gremlins are also the only manifestations of iffy cgi, graphical inconsistencies. Style is a 50/50 factor for this movie, I liked the cinematography, and the synth hey-it's-the-80's soundtrack, though I couldn't figure if it feels displaced or not. For a movie tributing the 80's, it's not 80's enough. Though, being over-the-top and a little ridiculous, maybe it is 80's enough... Sound editing is odd at times, during scenes outside of a flying plane, where there should be screams of skies storming, we kind of have an awkward silence, as if a couple sound layers were muted.There's a trivial backstory on why perhaps there's such discussion and dissatisfaction with the feminist nature of this film, it was originally written by Max Landis. Max Landis is now dealing with allegations of sexual abuse, and the script got heavily rewritten by director Roseanne Liang. You may entertain a couple of scenarios with this information, but personally I don't see any big problems with ""Shadow in the Cloud"" in regards to what's being so criticized.""Shadow in the Cloud"" is more expensive looking B blockbuster, straight-forward popcorn entertainment, a typical but thin creature feature, a ww2 action romp in the skies, and, really, not the worst offering in the first days of new hope. 2021, I mean.

57,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,1,5 August 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.Do literally anything else with your time...plow a field, eat a carrot, stare at an old tree. Anything.Well, that was different. I'm not sure how to review this movie. By all measures, and I mean all - it's a solid zero. Raspberry of the Year sorta deal. With that, it does succeed in showcasing just how completely bonkers an amateur filmmaker with a love for Anime (I'm guessing) and a Hollywood connection will go without adult supervision.So, this starts as a remake of the remake of Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. The first being the 1961 Twilight Zone Episode with William Shatner, the second being a segment in the 1983 TZ Movie, which was Produced by John Landis...which leads us to his son, Max Landis, who wrote this along with Anime fan and Director, Roseanne Liang.So, that's how we got here and the first 30 or so minutes, its works - sorta. Our Strong Women hero spends it all in the cramped tail gunner hold on the radio with the rest of crew, who are lobbing up clunky, harassing dialog that exists only in the minds of screenwriters who've never served and just assume that all military males are sexist monsters.For the First Act, I was okay with the single location shoot...slowly developing the unseen crew and our protagonist...and a gremlin...and Japanese Zero's. For a bit, it was entertaining. Had this stuck to a creature feature and war flick, it might have been reasonable.Nope.Once we learn she's a mom in a bad marriage and the ""top secret"" package she's carrying is a baby (who never cries until the end - just one ridiculous thing of many) it all falls apart. Not long after, the gremlin steals the baby and by the time Strong Women is climbing outside the aircraft upside down to rescue it, you'll either turn the movie off or, at a minimum, realize you're watching absolute nonsense.I'd mention she does fall out of the aircraft, but miraculously lands on an exploding Zero, which blows her up right back into the plane. The physics of that are impossible, but whatever - just go with it...
...because now the movie has morphed into a live action cartoon.Had the movie kept the original tone, it might have been okay, but it didn't and that's my main beef. It's clear that Landis and Liang abandoned their original idea and went in a completely different dummy direction.The final shot with her breastfeeding is meant, I guess, that you can be a mom and also bada** is embarrassing.If you want a masterclass to illustrate the importance of maintaining a tone and a narrative, this would be a good place to start.With all that, I can see how this film will appeal to a younger audience who are unencumbered by things like logic and coherence...to anyone who expects that, I'd watch something else.Cheers.",Shadow in the Cloud

61,ExpendableMan,"""They're called propellors baby, they help us fly.""",7,3 August 2021,"Shadow In The Cloud is ridiculous, but it is fun if you've sunk a few beers. Chloe Grace-Moretz plays a WW2 era pilot who hitches a ride on a bomber, only to find herself battling a monster that's hidden on the plane. A situation that's hampered by none of the crew believing her.Essentially, it's that classic Twilight Zone episode 'Nightmare At 20,000 Feet,' only set in the Pacific theatre during 1943. The leather-winged monstrosity clinging onto the wings isn't the only problem, as the skies are full of Japanese fighter planes and it rapidly turns into an explosive, hair-raising adventure.And yes, it is shamelessly daft, but that's part of the charm. Moretz has the most formidable grip strength of anyone that ever lived, climbing around the under-carriage of a B-17 as if it was perfectly natural, fighter planes detonate at just the right moment and crew members are riddled with bullets with reckless abandon.It all moves so quickly you don't have time to rationalise how silly it is, but if you want a good beer and pizza Friday night flick, Shadow In The Cloud is a good laugh.

Director Liang presented an interesting tapestry, too.It broke from the norm as being very talky in the first 30 minutes.

65,itsbobr,Did Someone say Gremlins? Quite Enjoyable,7,21 February 2021,"In 1943, we see a young girl named Maud Garrett (Chloe Grace Moretz) run to catch a plane holding a leather bag. We think she is on a secret mission and when she ends up in the B-17 that is what she tells the crew. The crew want no part of her and want her off the plane, but she convinces them she is on a secret classified mission and she has the papers to prove she is authorized and they give in.However the crew sits her in a turret below the plane, and she had to give up the leather bag to Quaid (Taylor John Smith) who said he would guard it.While in the turret, Garrett hears banter from the crew that is very crude, and extremely sexist. And it was quite uncomfortable to listen to it all, but she holds her ground and retorts with authority and the banter dies down.Then she sees a shadow in the clouds and cannot convince the men above what she is seeing. Not sure who said it was a Gremlin, but it is that. Where did it come from? Not explained. But the Gremlin wants in and Garrett isn't having any of it. She fires off a gun and the men above are now really concerned about her. Why does she have a gun?Now the real twist Is revealed and it is quite a tale that Garrett tells the crew. Now we find out what is in the leather bag. Then the Japanese start firing on the B-17 and oh, yes, the Gremlin still wants in.The next scenes take a long while to unfold, the B-17 is shot up, and the Gremlin somehow gets the leather bag and Garrett knows she must get it back. The camera angles and Garrett's positions are critical and we can't see any way that Garrett can get the bag back from the Gremlin. And don't forget the Japanese are still bombarding the B-17. Many of the crew are shot and the Captain is shot and dies.Garrett must find a way to help fly the plane to land with the co-pilot, who isn't in good shape also.Now, you may think that all of this is preposterous bordering on the ridiculous, but it all works and you are squirming to and fro on the couch hoping beyond hope this will end soon and all will be okay. It will, of course, but there are a few more battles to fight.

67,fung0,Easily Misunderstood,8,9 February 2021,"The endless negative reviews for this novel and rather good little film, come from viewers who can't grasp the concepts of fantasy, allegory or irony. If you do have a bit of imagination, ignore the nay-sayers and climb aboard for a slightly bumpy but overwhelmingly likeable ride.First: all criticisms of lack of historical accuracy, or lack of credible aerodynamics, need to be tossed in the bin. Early on, the movie introduces hallucinatory events that clearly indicate none of this is meant to be taken literally. This is a fable, set in a loose representation of a WW2 US bomber. And absolutley NOT a historical WW2 drama.Second: realize that any criticism of Chloe Moretz comes from viewers who never liked her in the first place, and presumably never will. Moretz fills the screen for a very large proportion of the running time, and she demonstrates all the charisma this requires. She holds the viewer's attention, and draws all except those not obstinately unwilling into an emotionally-charged alternate reality.Third: this fable actually does have a point. This is fantasy with a purpose. Those who fail to get that, or fail to enjoy it, are either capable of withstanding repeated blows with a sledgehammer, or simply refuse to accept a strongly feminist point of view. This is a film not just about a woman - it's about ALL women. (That's called allegory, folks.) It's also about the strength of human character, about the ability to overcome one's own fears, and a bunch of other really worthwhile things.The visuals are dizzying, unreal and absolutely gorgeous. At one point (you'll know it when you see it), I was strongly reminded of one of my favorite album covers: Flying Dreams, by Commander Cody. This whole film is essentially a 'flying dream,' and makes perfect sense as a dream. It's a story that takes place in that realm where powerful psychological forces play themselves out without regard for everyday waking logic, much less the laws of physics. That's a revealing, and above all - if you can go with it - a FUN place to visit.I'm deliberately not giving much away. If you're going to enjoy this film at all, let it take you by surprise. And above all, try to accept it for what it is, instead of shooting it down for not being something it isn't for one second trying to be.",Shadow in the Cloud
68,celt007,Throw Back 80s Horror,3,1 January 2021,"I found it a throw back to 80s horror with its Carpenter-esque sound track opening riff , right down to the creature .
Could have been a better edited movie ( I get the scenes the male actors were in got dropped )
Too much of the Chloe character , movies short of 90 min and they could have squeezed 15 min of in to build a relationship between the characters before and after the reveal of the package.
It's blatant slap in the face of gender and political correctness is lost because it comes across as forces and not natural ( maybe they were aiming for laughs , but failed ) .
With the big names and unbelievable special effects it loses points about 2 and 2 for editing .

69,drunken_munki,Saying this is confused would be kind,4,7 January 2021,"The film starts in the middle of a scene with no context. Chloë Grace Moretz ends up on a World War 2 era military aircraft. The setting is dark and gritty WW2 but with electro synth music, which I personally love but think it doesn't fit the setting at all.She is the only cool headed and combat minded character in a setting of military soldiers. All the men are clearly incompetant morons. She is the Mary Sue by forced incompetence of everyone else. She also is the baby carrying, breast feeding, monster fighting mama jamma of the movie. Nothing of this film is realistic or engaging.Next there is a smattering of unrealistic characters and weird stuff, including a man sized dog like bat creature that is climbing around the outside of the aircraft. Theres a few plot inconsistencies and stupid ass-pulls that happen in the story.The movie didn't have me hooked at any point really and I was just confused as to what I was watching. The acting is as poor as the camera work; which leads me to think this is all an issue with the direction.The visual effects look poor when outside the aircraft, there is no realistic feel to anything. The music really doesn't fit anything and is comically bad particularly when the second and third acts are playing out. The monster is average looking in design and technical composition.4/10 better than some big budget stuff this year but otherwise a below average viewing that I will never watch again.",Shadow in the Cloud

Chloë Grace Moretz Does her thing again here and she is terrific in an another over the top role. There are other cast members, but this is her show! Nick Robinson's role is small, but he's in the spirit of things and fun. The gremlin idea is a cool one as they were a term used in WWII for any kind of unexplainable or unexpected plane malfunction, but making it a reality thing, as it does here, doesn't really work all that well. That's a shame, but nice try. This seems to be lost on many here, and I sorta see why, but if you like things are at least original, you might like this. I can't imagine it would actually bore anyone as it's short with non-stop action. Some women might take offense to some of the sexism here, but hey, these are 1940's army men. That's the way it was.

76,ivko,what's beyond absurd?,5,4 September 2021,"This movie is the weirdest, most ridiculous film I've seen in a while. Taking place in 1943 during WWII, the movie opens with the protagonist, a young woman dressed in an Airforce uniform, boarding a military craft as it taxies for take off. She claims to be a mechanic and pilot herself and is carrying a small leather box which she claims contains top secret cargo, and she has orders signed by a high ranking officer ordering the crew to transport her on the flight.To say that the crew treats her poorly would be a massive understatement. Almost to a man their attitude is deeply hostile and misogynistic, which may or may not be historically accurate, I don't know. It feels over the top, but we are talking about the 1940s so who knows. In any case, for some reason, they claim it's because ""all of the stations are full"" but this feels like a pretty thin rationale, they order her to relinquish her package and get into the Sperry. For those unfamiliar with WWII military aircraft the Sperry is one of the machine gun turrets on an aircraft that's sort of like a glass bubble welded onto the bottom of the plane. It's a claustrophobic little space with transparent walls and a terrifying view of the open sky beneath where a soldier would sit to fire at enemy aircraft.While down there she listens on the intercom to some more extraordinarily crude banter from the crew about her before noticing something on the plane which she describes as a ""shadow"" as well as an enemy aircraft dipping in and out of the clouds near the plane. She warns the crew about both but is quickly dismissed until the aircraft is suddenly attacked. Things escalate quickly as she discovers she can't open the hatch to exit the Sperry and must use the tools available to her to improvise a defense against two enemies.Eventually the contents of her cargo are revealed as well as her true backstory, which is that her name is Maude and she has a background I won't go into for the sake of spoilers except to say that it isn't what she claimed and that she was seeking to escape a danger.Around here the action kicks into high gear as Maude tries to survive more attacks on the aircraft. It quickly becomes apparent that this is a movie about female empowerment as she undergoes extreme risk to keep her and her cargo safe, calmly tackling threats while the men often literally cower in terror. It's a little on the nose, but I wouldn't really have a problem with it if they had matched her backstory to her actions. As it is, her actions just don't mesh in the slightest with her backstory; over the course of the film we'll see her display expertise in Airforce combat, perform incredible feats of strength as she maneuvers around the plane, fly the craft under emergency conditions, and fight like Rambo in hand to hand combat against a deadly enemy, none of which are skills suggested by her character's background,It begs the question of where Maude developed such a wide range of skills. In the movies logic it's simply because she's determined enough to just do it, but of course life just doesn't work that way so it ends up really stretching that suspension of disbelief hard. It also sort of calls into question the reason Maude got onto the plane in the first place. Given that we've seen her fight like a one person army, it begs the question of whether she would have needed to board the aircraft to begin with since it appears there's almost nothing she can't handle personally anyway.The reality is that her background and her actions in the film are completely disconnected. Her backstory is there to make her relatable and encourage the audience to feel sympathy for her while her superpowers are just what's convenient for conquering all of the threats thrown against her during the film. Chloë Grace Moretz, who plays Maude, is of course famous for her role in the Kick A** films playing a character who should be vulnerable in real life but by virtue of special training is actually far more deadly than she appears. Here though there is no suggestion of a similar background; she just sort of has her superpowers with no real explanation provided. This, combined with an array of stunts that make James Bond look like a wimp, combines to produce moments that are meant to be tense but come off as almost comical instead, including one scene in particular showing her re-entering the plane that is nothing short of pure absurdist fantasy (if you've seen the film you definitely know which scene I'm talking about and if you haven't you'll recognize it immediately when it happens).In the end, ridiculous or not, the action sequences are mostly nicely shot and the movie has decent pacing that keeps things from getting dull, so the movie isn't painful to watch, just filled with a bunch a scenes that will make you roll your eyes. Acting-wise most of the cast are one dimensional characters and only Ms. Moretz gets much chance to display any range, but her charisma and acting chops are good enough to at least make you root for her, even if you're aware that she's clearly never in any real danger. I'd say it's basically a forgettable flick that you can waste a couple of hours on when you've got some time to kill, but don't go in looking for an instant classic.",Shadow in the Cloud

Once you have that perspective I think you'll enjoy the film. It's as cheesy and implausible as the best comic books out there. Some parts are so cheesy you laugh when you're really meant to cry, other parts so unbelievable you gasp in disbelief.

And maybe in the theater that helps even more than at home. I plunked down my 20 bucks to watch this as my first film of 2021 streaming on my very nice home screen.
I am the kind of guy critics write for. I love Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. I try to take in every Oscar favorite by the time of the awards shows. All I can say is I will remember 2020 as the year of the really slow film. This week I took in two Oscar favorites, First Cow and Never Rarely Sometimes Always. I rated them both a 7 but man did they drag on and on. So I needed some action, and this film had a couple good action scenes, it was never boring, but what a mess of a script and really horrible direction. I also find the soundtrack somewhat awful. The person who did the sound could learn from watching some Giorgio Moroder films if they want to use electronic music for suspense.
The Moritz character will never win mother of the year for bringing her baby to a wartime aerial battle. What is up with that? And it just gets dumber from there.

83,pontram,A Welcome Change in a Flat Landscape of Sequels and Remakes,8,4 January 2021,"Before watching this, I looked a bit into those really bad reviews here. So I decided to get the experience myself...
And it was quite good. I did like those dialogues over intercom very much. Once in a uniform, some men think they are oblieged to talk...well, like idiots. There's similiar idiotic talk I heard myself during the time I served, decades ago.
But the movie isn't about how idiotic men can be, but what a certain group of women can do, if they have to, at least about what we believe they can do.
However, the movie continued to surprise me, the climbing scene was completeley captivating, I liked even becoming a bit dizzy...after that I thought 'Why do people hate this movie so much ? - It's just crazy !"" (and not ludicruous, of course unrealistic, but nevertheless very effective).
People seem to hate the movie because of the supernatural element. And I agree, mostly, that this was just a bad idea, which draws the movie ""down"" from its potential class, which would be ""wartime drama"" and is much more respectable than ""fantasy action"".
However, technically there is not much to criticise, camera, cut, direction, music, fx, all decent, and of course, we can see that Chloe is able to singlehandedly carry a movie.

Chloe Moretz had pretty good face expressions, which painted a clear image of a young woman with good self confidence in a time when sexism was culturally completely accepted. I suffered with her when she faced the bad language of the other plane crew. It had some moments when the movie got murky and, which forced the suspens to a strong level. I loved to see Moretz as a very strong and determined character, which was Great.But then the story turned unlogic, unrealistic and sometimes simply dumb. The writers didn't care about physics anymore, some moments are cheesy, others seem to be constructed without any simple knowledge of anatomy. I'm not a doctor, but even I know that some things can't be like they were shown. To the end it get's worse and worst. It seems to be a try to push feminism real hard, which would be ok, if it wouldn't look so dumb. So it does feminism a bad deed. Partly I had the feeling they wanted to sabotage the carrer of Moretz, who played fine in the first part of the movie. The second part made the impression that the writers didn't know anymore how to let it end better. It further made the impression to me that they had real troubles to think of an end that puts the story to a comprehensible and fitting end. But the end just revealed the fact that they needed one specific element in the first half (I don't want to explain here, not to spoil), just to force the story somehow. That's really poor.To the end it nearly became a close to unbearable b*ll***t. I'd recommend it to people who like trash movies.

But it just doesn't work together.This is also made more confusing as it is backed by like 80's synths. The majority of the score is just that. In a WW2 film? That is just insane to me.I also found an issue that 85% of the movie takes place in one tiny area with one single character just talking to like 7 characters off screen who all have different accents.

87,torrascotia,Like a very bad date....,1,30 July 2021,"Its usually a red flag when a movie has an odd running time....and this time the flag was right.Its obvious from the scores that this is a very bad movie for a number of reasons and I will go through a few of them.Basically this is a misandrist movie.The men are basically shown as being both sexist and racist as well as seemingly hating one another for no good reason. This makes zero sense based on the fact that military people rely on each other for their lives and simply put, they have to get along if they expect to stay alive.They are also shown as being incompetent at their jobs, as if someone who is being shot at during a fight would suddenly ignore the fact they were being shot at in order to stare at a woman or have a discussion? Dont worry I hear the Japanese are very polite so I am sure they will stop shooting so you can have a little chat!The dialogue is horrific, its mainly men being overly aggressive for no apparent reason. Its as if someone has mistaken normal male banter with language that will likely lead to violence, and thought that was the norm.The score simply doesn't fit with the movie. Its likely someone though a synth score works on Stranger Things so it should on this as well, however ST is set in the 80s when synth pop was a thing. Glenn Millar wasn't using synths in the 1940s!The action scenes with Chloe are simply laugh out loud funny. First off apparently when she is hanging onto a plane travelling hundreds of miles an hour, not only does her hair not move, neither does her body! She can also figure out how to use machine guns without being told, shoot down enemy planes on a first attempt as well as beat up monsters in a punch up that no man was able to, while having a broken arm. And to make an even bigger point she breast feeds in public!While I can watch a movie with a female lead and director it doesn't mean that its open season on men in general. The reason I say this movie is like a bad date is because its like spending time with a woman who hates men and badmouths them, but still expects company!Highly doubtful there will be a second date for either the director or Chloe at this rate.",Shadow in the Cloud
88,a.lampert,Sci-fi black comedy within WW2 Airforce drama.,7,15 August 2021,"I wasn't expecting much after seeing the reviews here but am now convinced the low scores are from people without a sense of humour. It starts as a drama with Chloe Moretz boarding a Army Air Force plane with a confidential bag, not to be opened under any circumstances. Initially she speaks with an English accent telling the crew she's an experienced flight officer. She's ordered to get into a cramped compartment below where the other crew are and she's forced to listen to crude locker room jokes about the female sex. This is quite a long scene, maybe half hour, and I don't know where the story is going when suddenly sinister things start to happen and she switches to her American accent. From here on, all manner of crazy things occur, turning the film from drama to virtually slapstick black comedy. Personally I can watch Chloe Grace Moretz for hours and never get enough of her and her versatility in this picture is a sight to behold, at least I thought so. She carries the film on her own, the actors with her only being minor players. As the film draws to a conclusion I thought it got better and better and funnier. It's like a superheroine meets Alien meets Mel Brooks it's that crazy. Really enjoyed the ride so 7 🌟 from me.",Shadow in the Cloud
89,chevolek,Much better than expected,7,1 January 2021,"As a man, I find unpleasant that most reviews here are from men showing a misogynistic attitude because the lead character is female and that women were not involved in planes or weapons during WWII which is totally wrong as you can see on the credits where we see old clips from women flying war planes, shooting guns and doing self-defense moves. Just because they´re women it does not mean they aren´t capable of doing things than we men can do. In fact, many women are way better than us men on many things but it seems most commenters here can´t handle the fact that some women can do (and did) many of those things. Also arguing how feminist is this film because most men in the plane tell the female character disrespectful sexual jokes which I believe it can be true.
Unfortunately like most modern movie trailers, they give away too much.
The Pros:
-Chloë Grace Mortez did a great performance on this movie.
-The score by Mahuia Bridgman-Cooper was great and helped the movie a lot, it sounds a lot like those scores from 80´s films.
-The action scenes and drama scenes were very good.
The Cons:
-Some scenes where the male characters are facing the screen (i.e. when they´re introduced)
-Some scenes were very unrealistic due to physics like hanging out of a plane in mid-air or shooting a gun mid-air and the bullets going straight not being affected by strong winds or throwing boxes out of the plane in mid-air and the boxes going on a straight line instead of being immediately dragged by the wind. The creature walking under the plane in mid-air without being dragged by the wind and the lead character falling out of a plane and going back in by the blast of another plane (most of this scenes are shown in the trailer).
-The last scene (a fist fight) and walking out of a flying plane while carrying a box with a baby were the things that were a downer, mostly it was the climax scene with the fist fight. It would have been more realistic to have the fight done waving a piece of wood or steel as a weapon.It´s ""Gremlins"" meets ""The Twilight Zone: The Movie"" meets ""Memphis Belle"".Overall it is an enjoyable movie, not to be taken seriously because of the lack of physics and the creature which clearly its head design was taken from real bats, but still, it was well done by CGI.

Chloë Grace Moretz gives a very good performance and the beginning of the movie was intriguing. The way they introduced the airplane It seemed like it might be a supernatural movie where nothing is as it seems. Well, everything is as it seems and that's not so good.They make it quite clear this movie is about a gremlin attack so no spoilers there. That story becomes progressively ridiculous until it collapses on itself. Suddenly Chloe becomes this incredible badass who goes out the of the plane to fight the gremlin. In a totally absurd scene she falls out of the plane then an explosion blows her back into the plane, unhurt.It goes full blown stoopit from there. The climax is CSM beating the crap out the gremlin, which is big as she is and has razor sharp claws, while all the soldiers look on. This movie was badly written and I can't believe people actually looked at the dailies and didn't stop for a quick rewrite. Pretty much a waste of really good performance by Chloë Grace Moretz .One more thing. All the men are total cliche characters. They are also very mean spirited and crude. They don't behave like soldiers, at all. They behave dickhead frat boys. I found their portrayal offensive. It was obvious that whoever wrote this hates men and this was their big chance to get their licks in. I guess in the new oppressive and preachy.

I can see I'm gonna be a lone wolf in calling this a 7 but very close to an 8. That's ok, ""The Thing"" was critical panned when it came out. Not everybody has to like the same things. I think I can summarize this as saying I kinda already want to rewatch it.Banging on about the Sam Raimi reference, this is a horror adventure comedy. The story isn't invested in being serious horror or either of the other two. Its trying to find that lost art of being ...ridiculous?CGM plays a female agent in the military who forces her way onto a plane with a confidential mission. No one takes her seriously and everything goes to hell when the plane is attacked by both the natural and super natural elements of flight and war.It has it's moments where the director and writer are doing interesting and fun things that reminded me vaguely of Evil Dead or maybe cabin in the woods, you know you have the cornball everyday joe cast fighting literal hell on earth, but neither being cartoon characters nor overly dramatic. When its good its great, unfortunately when its not good...its really not good.The dialog is decidedly not witty or timely. The entire crew is racist and sexist. Theres a time and place where that can good work in a self-aware style like RDJ in tropic thunder. The dialog in this however, is dumb, mean spirited and unrealistic in wartime. By that I mean its non-stop. Throughout the film the characters chatter nonstop on the squad channel. Calling each other slurs and at times, outright babbling. Even in tense WWII action moments this is simply not how people would talk no matter how cavalier their personalities. What makes this worse is CGM is the only one with any personality. The rest seem like fake cardboard cutouts with lazy dialog. Theres a few shining moments like a scene similar Will Smiths ""welcome to earth"" in ID, but the rest is lack luster. This needed an expert with at least some WWII personel knowledge. These people very ..very inauthentic. Painfully so.All that said it was smartly paced and fun. I really enjoyed myself.

When I saw the trailer, I thought it was something about strategy movie, or the tense ambiance from World War II like Enemy at the Gates, but actually it isn't. It is about relationship affair and the movie about how to protect your loved ones. I am not sure I can follow all the technical aspects here, it is too easy to be implemented in the real life, there are some jumpscares of killing and shooting, but I can appreciate Morretz acting. From the beginning until the end, you can see the consistence of her highest motivation to defend for herself and her loved ones. Then of course this kind of 'woman affair' somehow represented in this movie. During World War II, women somehow had been ordered to serve the country, but they had to abandon their kids, babies, to go to the war as soldier. In this point, I can attract what the script writer want to reach. Woman sacrifice so much in the war, then we have to prioritize the peace for everybody.

What it left is a B-movie-like action sequence.The special effects are fairly bad - not bad as such, more on par with lower budget TV shows ...

There are also many reviews that are fake and just there from people who watched the trailer.Is it Anti Men ?? Well no more than say Alien for example. It's WW2 and soldiers in a predominantly male environment are joined by a female on a military missionThe concept to them as was absurd as it would have been during the war but not totally impossible especially nearing the end of the war.There were in fact a few commissioned female flight offices although non were American. Having said that we don't actually know if the lead was in fact telling the truth about being a flight officer but it was clear she was connected to sone AirForce in some way.Were all the men abusive when she got on the plane, some shocked some bewildered a couple angry and 1 who was more so abusive in a sexual way.Now this is during the war when often a woman's place was not on military vessel so these reactions were more likely to be accurate. We see these situations today in a society where females are accepted in virtually every role and we know sexism was far nearly 80 years ago.So the anger is most probably from little snowflake boys sitting behind their little computers feeling hard done by for no reason whatsoever as its not supposed to be a reflection on Men in today's society.Nor may I add does this film have any reflection on reality in virtually any way. This is a monster film FFS it's a pure fantasy film the setting just happens to be on a WW2 plane.The opening is a bit chaotic but after the first 15-20 mins there is a good 40 mins of claustrophobic suspense and mystery of which Chloe Grace Moretz nails it.This was the best part of the film in my eyes and having a fear of heights it made my palms sweaty.Once their is the plot reveal the action steps up a gear to nitro levels and at times came across a bit clunky or over the top but never unenjoyable nor unentertaining.The finale was a bit lame but I've seen worse.I guess there was a big crossover in genres within the film that blend into one another as time progresses which was ok but also jolting and I think this is its biggest weakness but no doubt added to make it more marketable.Some Hollywood brat was in the writing credits as were many other writers and it shows upon the ending.Visually however the film is well done, the effects and the belief you were in the air and vulnerable with the characters was its strong point.Some OTT action sequences and a bit if schlock ended up taking you out of that insecurity and put you into a more relaxed action flick and while I groaned a bit, then a bit more and at the end I laughed I still enjoyed the film and accepted it for what it was.It's a 6.8 out of 10 for me and most of that score is for the first hr.

It was unpredictable and had twists and turns, and you slowly start to know more and more about this lead character. You're in the same position as the men on the plane who are off camera communicating with her. It's over the top and zany, it's part horror and part action war movie. The sound effects and score really made some scenes intense and bad ass.After 45 minutes you find out another twist and it ends up being a let down.

You're average superhero movie is more believe than this.Sure it's a movie so you likely need suspend disbelief. Be they not only ask you to suspend more than 100%.

It's like they were trying to say something but all the bridging scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.Then there's the whole subplot and trying to make something out of the protagonist. It's clear what they're trying to do; but they just went totally overboard with it as if they wanted to ram it down your throat at any costs. They could have made the same message without overdoing it.Then there's all the weird cut scenes.The vastly limited sets / locations like it's a one act play it they were given the smallest budget possible. I can almost see that after paying CHLOË most of their (limited) budget was gone and they had nothing left.I can see how they want to have a main plot and a supporting, but different subplot; but the movie is more like a mash up of two different movies they tried to smash together.I could see this having been so much better if the writing wasn't seeming butchered and the director confused as to what they really wanted to say, or even how they could convert it.",Shadow in the Cloud

116,Luv2Spooge,A very misunderstood movie...,9,6 March 2021,"My 1st review for this movie hasn't even been reviewed by the staff and published when I realized I got this whole film wrong. It actually occurred to me after reading some of the top 1 star ratings of this film and the questions people were posing.My original review was extremely detailed in pointing out the ridiculous plot, the failed movie elements trying to combine a historical drama with isolation horror and ... well gremlins. I gave it 2 stars.However, after thinking it through, how could I have missed this? It was SCREAMING at the audience in the middle of the film!The gremlins are METAPHORICAL. They're NOT real. It was quoted by the captain, ""A gremlin is not an animal. A gremlin is someone else's f-up"" ""A gremlin means someone screwed up and you're blaming Santa Claus.""This doesn't mean in the movie they're not real, but it does give direction and meaning to what the film's message is trying to say. If we take the captain's quote directly, it means the gremlins were reflection of someone's screw up.The ship being torn apart is the engineer's fault as they said earlier that these things get old and bound to fall apart. Remember she told them right when she came aboard there was something wrong with one of the hydraulics.There's also the information fault when they thought Japs could not fly out that far.To the main character, the screw up is both her first marriage at a young age and also her affair.To Walt, his screw up is leaving her and not owning up as a man.There's a few more, but I didn't really take the time to go through it. With this view, the ending is the titular character overcoming her mistakes, her screw ups, and finally ""stop running away"" and taking back control of her life. This is reflected in the gremlin actually running away from her.However, I think that might be harder to grasp for some and easier to say the gremlins were metaphorical for their ""fears,"" which derived from their screw ups. So the ending, the young man overcame his fears and fixed his mistake by proposing to her. She overcame her fears when she beat up the gremlin, she stopped being a victim. Notice this came right after Walt owned up, giving her both confidence and hope in both humanity and herself.People say this is a film about feminism, I disagree. Especially with that ending. I think the message is about a bunch of people's screw ups, people not doing the right thing. And the main message is how a man treats a woman is important. Her first marriage turned her into a battered woman, a victim, and someone who only knows to run away. First to the army to get away from him, then into the arms of another man who left her, and finally running aboard this plane to get away from it all because she had no choice left in life. Notice the whole first 1/2 of the movie she was trapped in the gun turret? It was a metaphor for her life trapped by her screw ups with no choice left.Though the major part of her character is revealed in motherhood, willingness to defy the impossible to protect her child, but through the film, she was still a victim and had a hard time overcoming her gremlin. It was when Walt decided to step up and be a man, doing the right thing, he gave her the final piece to stand up against her demons and overcome.This is a very misunderstood film and I hope this review has helped shape your view of it.",Shadow in the Cloud

The entire movie takes place on one of those WW2 era flying fortresses but other than a few opening scenes a good hour or more of the movie takes place with Moretz character being stuck in a turret bubble by the misogynistic crew she's onboard with. It starts out that she's on a super secret mission to deliver a package of utmost priority, one that can influence the outcome of the war. But she's a girl so they just treat her like crap for over half the movie over the intercom system.The rest...well there's a monster plot, a couple air fights, some weird plot twists where identities are revealed. But they don't mix, the movie doesn't know what it is so when the plot takes a turn you're wondering what the hell is going on. It's explained, you're not left in the dark, but it's just plain bizarre how it jumps between genres. And then at the end the soundtrack gets weirdly techno and pop sounding, which doesn't match what's happening on screen.The acting was generally fine, the movie is plain ridiculous though, it really wasn't a very good script and the whole monster aspect wasn't explained at all and made zero sense.

Then the big change of pace hits and I thought that was less successfully.I think anyone who would enjoy the second half of the movie would have probably given up half way through watching the first half.The effects at the begging of the change over are just awful, and the whole sequence is just silly. Why you would turn the camera upside down in that way, which only highlights how unrealistic things are I don't know. It feels like you've switched on to the SYFY channel by mistake.After the first 'action' sequence the effects are quite good and, for a slightly silly action film, just about believable. I think if the first action sequence was dropped or cut down the change of pace would work better in fact if the whole film were cut down slightly it would be a better film.Agree the script and dialogue were quite poor at times with everyone in the cast being interchangeable and given nothing much to do, apart from Chloë Grace Moretz. Perhaps if they had developed some of the characters they would have made the longer running time without having to drag out some of the action sequences to the point that they became so silly like they do.The sets and cinematography and central performance were very good, I just wish they had taken some more time on the writing.",Shadow in the Cloud

It has really intense moments and keeps you on edge of your seat for the most part. The setting is also very unique and with a running time of only an hour and 23 minutes, it passes by fast.

And, it even started off amazing, good mood, great pace, and claustrophobic atmosphere. Then I basically started to watch a different movie all together, and it had nothing to do with the world we all know!So (Maude) Chloe Grace Moretz jumps aboard a plane in the dead of night on a super secret mission. The crew are all sexist a-holes; so far so good. Creepy stuff happens, there are Japanese... suddenly, and I am waiting for the laugh track. I mean, 18 wheeler off the road, train derailing, Titanic sinking (too much on that one?). I can't believe that this is where they go with the movie!With a world of options, with a great start, why go where they do? From horror to ridiculous in 30 seconds. It is basically two movies, one creepy and good, one ridiculous and could be good - think Overlord done in the stupidest possible way.Chloe is great, and she is the only bright spot.

I liked the claustrophobic setting of the belly turret and not cutting away to the rest of the plane; could have led to a scary movie as she's helpless to do much while the gremlin is breaking things.Could not stand the obviousness of ""look how terrible men are"", and how very badass at everything the heroine was. Not just awesome in the moment because she was doing something to protect her child, but way more experienced at flying, shooting, strategy, and maintaining a cool head.I also didn't think Chloe was really acting here.

139,cristinalinderman,A magnificent female empowerment film.,8,3 January 2021,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Roseanne Liang and the crew brought a magnificent female empowerment film. The story sets in WWII, a female pilot with an important classified mission, and while traveling there is a presence lurking on board. I fully enjoyed this film especially all of the insane awesome scenes which were keeping me so pumped, what a new exhilarating film to start the year! A story that had two powerful themes that surround us women, I can't reveal one because it would spoil the main suspense. The other theme was equality, it doesn't matter the year it was set, the message was clear and powerful, because to this day some people still don't see women as equals, and this movie projects that women are not the damsel in distress, how I loved the strong representation of women. It also incredibly delivers how far will one go to survive no matter how impossible the situation is especially on saving a loved one. I found it fresh and unique in the way it sets those themes especially in this kind of genre and how perfectly it builds up to the big reveal. The perspective of the film was cleverly shot because it keeps one intensely on edge and the other senses sharp and adding the concept of gremlins kept it more captivating.I was blown away by the choice of music and one of my favorite genres, synth music. At the beginning of the movie the composer, Mahuia Bridgman-Cooper delivers the synth score with such an incredible vibe setting the strange pathway of what the storyline was about to unleash.The cast was solid but all the praise goes to the female actor Chloë Grace Moretz.

The absurdity of the action sequences and the silly gremlin/monster make it not the least bit scary. But it's not funny either. Maybe if the makers had gone more comedic, like say ""Raising Arizona"", there might have been a better movie.The characters make ZERO sense, despite the shallow attempt to seem to be about sexism and female empowerment- it's not.

147,KaZenPhi,Missed opportunity,4,16 February 2021,"What could have been an interesting take on a classic twilight zone premise ends up being a hot mess that is only saved from being a total failure by its lead actress, good cgi, a creative anachronistic soundtrack and a genuinely suspenseful first half hour.I was fully on board in the beginning: a nice mystery premise, rising tension, atmospheric visuals. A B17 bomber is a good choice for a chamber play and one I haven't seen being used quite like that before, although as I've mentioned in my opening line this premise has of course been used in a very famous twilight zone episode and an equally famous Simpsons halloween episode that parodied it, so I can't give the movie that much credit for simply changing the type of plane and the time period. Still, it works as a Memphis Belle meets direct-to-video horror mash up. Had the writing just stayed on track this could have easily been a good 6 out of 10 b-movie, however it completely falls apart about 30 minutes in, as too many plot ideas are thrown in the mix, none of which are remotely thought out or finished.One of the many plot points the script seems to be going for and failing is a female empowerment angle (I think? I'm not quite sure to be honest). I usually appreciate any such attempt but the writing is so clumsy and surface level it almost makes you cringe. Furthermore for an author like Max Landis, who frequently uses the problematic term ""Mary Sue"" to criticise other people's writing on social media it's ironic he employed many of the same tropes for Chloe Grace Moretz's character who is comically adept at every random skill that conveniently keeps the plot going. It's almost as bad as one of those midlife crisis Liam Neeson action thrillers that started with Taken.Other than the desintegrating plot what is at least funny to me is the filmmakers' complete lack of understanding how planes work. Apparently WWII era bombers all cruise very quietly at a leisurely 15 miles an hour so you can safely climb around on them in flight. I know this isn't a documentary on aviation but you can only bend the rules of physics so far until it becomes absurd and laughable.There's not much left to say, this movie is very light on nutrients. I sincerely hope Chloe Grace Moretz starts making better career decisions. It'd be a waste of her talent if she kept trying to redeem movies like this or the 5th wave with her presence.",Shadow in the Cloud
148,Tron79,Chloe Kicks Ass,10,1 January 2021,"This movie deserves a much higher rating than the reviews I've read here. I'm giving it a full 10, because I haven't felt so exhilarated after watching a movie in quite some time. Chloe was a force!! I haven't held my breath so much on stunt scenes in as long as I can remember. I had a similar feeling during classic Arnold and Clint Eastwood movies. Don't mess with Arnold, and definitely don't mess with Chloe!! As she says in the trailer, ""You have no idea how far I'll go!""From the reviews, it look like some folks had a totally opposite reaction than me, but I am very happy I purchased this movie on Amazon Prime instead of just renting. It was available for early release. I will be watching it again.Many will remember Chloe from her iconic role as Hit Girl from the Kick Ass movies 11 years ago. As she aged, she has grown as an actress choosing dramatic roles, such as ""The Miseducation of Cameron Post."" She has a few horror flicks in her portfolio, including ""Let Me In"" from way back in 2010 when she played a very disturbing vampire child who never wore shoes. And of course, she played Carrie. This film is a good mixture of action and horror, and a great role for Chloe. I read reviews that said it was a step backward for her. I disagree. She shows her acting chops by getting us to care about her character as well as showing she hasn't lost her action hero instincts from her younger days as Hit Girl.I recommend this movie if you want to see a Kick Ass role for Chloe and if you are in the mood to sweat out some incredible stunts.",Shadow in the Cloud

151,urbanswami,Feminism 101 in session,1,1 January 2021,"Shadow in the Cloud is an all around good action film; good setting, good acting, awesome action sequences, up untill you start to think about it.Spoilers Ahead!!!The movie starts off with a midcentury style educational cartoon for airplane mechanics about competence and how there are no gremlins. This is clearly a jab at J. B. Peterson's stance on patriarchy and his notion of likening SJWs' ""strugle"" to ""fix"" society to a monkey with a wrench hammering away at a combat helicopter, trying to fix it. JBP's stance is presented almost word for word in this opening scene, stating that any malfunction of the complex mechanism can only be due to human failure and not some made up monster. The proper way to maintain it is by being vigilent and competent.And then the movie builds on the idea that the monster is real. The monster needs to be faught and killed. Naturally by a woman. Because no sane man would ever believe that a monster is the source of his troubles.The one redeeming quality of Maude, the protagonist, is that she's a mother. Yes, women can do a lot of the things men do, when they're properly motivated; being a mother is a key motivator. Which leads us back to the nonsensical nature of the movie.It is revealed that Maude, fearing for her newborn child, had to choose between the wrath of an abusive spouse and the horrors of WWII and found the latter to be the better option. That is misandry, pure and simple. We get a lot of good action sequences out of this ""You have no idea how far I'll go!"". Good stuff. But it's all undercut by the premise that a drunken husband is worse than an army of trained soldiers intent on killing you. Also at the end, when all is good and well, the monster reapears wounded. Who to fight it off and finally kill it, but the mama-bear. Even though, there are three soldiers present; even though they could all just leave and let the monster die on it's own.Finally we have all the minute stuff, like how there were no female pilots in WWII, or how the radio chatter of the male crew is over-the-top coarse, or how the soundtrack is pure '80s retro synth-pop blatantly banking on the nostalgia built up by other movies and TV-shows.In conclusion: on the one hand this movie is a feminist propaganda film, on the other hand it's not worth watching.",Shadow in the Cloud

Ms Moretz shines in a nearly solo act, getting to use expressions and body language in a confined space to convey the characters state of mind, and just like Ripley, shows what can turn a woman to use real violence.
Many of the scenes and setups are cliched and trope filled, and real world aerodynamics takes a back seat to the thrill ride, from the opening music that Carpenter could have written, to the final shot, the only time the roller coaster pauses is just before the credits roll.

This movie is a big screen adventure viewing appeal (i.e. scenery joyride) or otherwise would be visually appealing on a good large 4k tv. I was surprise to see the New Zealand labels all over this flick and therefore I quickly became more forgiving. There is so much potential that I can see the concepts (WW2 female airforce personnel) inspiring a proper fiction war romantic flick about allied service women in a man's environment. Alternatively, there is another movie possibility that could be about monster on plane during WW2 where a woman has to save the day (i.e. ""Alien"" but set during WW2 on a plane). Combining both elements didnt work as proof in this production. Just enjoy the ride and side step the seriousness.",Shadow in the Cloud

What starts as a half-believable and serious film that quickly managed to get me invested (except for that unbelievable offensive banter by the flight crew) and even took a turn towards the fantastic (at which point I was really starting to like the film), absolutely loses its tone and deteriorates first into complete shlock and then into hilariously bad action with a pointless ending.If SHADOW IN THE CLOUD would have managed to keep its more serious and engaging tone, it would have been a very solid genre film with some great ideas.As is is, the film suffers not only from its inconsistency and lacking script, but also from its weirdly unfitting score, so I guess it is kinda consistent in its inconsistency. And with the unnecessarily crude and tacked-on feminist symbolism at the end, the film finally and completely gives up on any finesse or smartness and just left me staring at the end credits that feature a highlight reel of female airforce members, none of which have deserved such a puny and silly ""tribute"".What a dumb movie.",Shadow in the Cloud

We also find out her plane has a black co-pilot (even rarer still, except in movie fantasy land) so we hear a lot of racism.Guess which two people on board end up saving the day? And who ends up dying? That's right, all the purveyors of the worst abuse. As satisfying as it is to see these wretches get torn up by monsters or reduced to ashes by fire, it all feels a bit predictable and cheap.Apart from her phoney cries of distress eliciting howls of laughter from me throughout, Chloe is pretty good in this role whether it be fighting off vicious creatures or trying to reason with a bunch of cavemen.It's the script that lets her down, and in the future I would suggest the people behind this mess try making a separate film for each genre they want to tackle.

So many did! In truth, this film does more in 80 minutes than what others do with twice the time and triple the budget. Don't get me wrong, it has it's shortcomings -what few there are. The director, Roseanne Liang, shows promise. It would've been interesting to see what more could've been accomplished with a full fledged production team behind her.Chloe Grace Moretz portrays a flight courier with the Allied forces delivering a secret package aboard 'The Fool's Errand' in WWII. Her physicality along with a very convincing English accent make her the perfect heroine. She of course struggles uphill against the typical sexism spending more than half the time locked away in the Sperry ball turret. The dialog is passable and even interesting at times but to sustain the level of suspense the clever addition of some hobgoblin terrorizing their vessel is employed.Virtually everything makes sense and comes together for one cohesive picture; from the name of the plane, to the cartoon clip that preceded it, to the secret package, and a few other small details.",Shadow in the Cloud

171,Clive_W,Mismatch of three plots in one,1,3 January 2021,"Where to begin? firstly let's look at the issue with the three plots running throughout the film, we spend the majority of the film in the gun turret, a full 50 minutes of the run time is spend inside the turret, incredible dull, with some the most annoying and completely pointless dialog which has no impact or development on the overall story, during this time we have the reveal that the secret package is in fact a baby, fair enough but I'm confused as to why this would be happening, why a bomber plane, were there not other safer options to get home? Ignoring that point and moving on... we have the annoying weird cut scenes to other characters, how to best describe this scene is when the other characters are ""introduced"" we jump to a black background with the character stood in a weird blue/green/red light, not a clue as to why we didn't just cut to the characters on the plane. All this time we are still inside the gun turret, so plot one is just the secret mission which turns out to be the baby, plot point two is the creature attacking the plane. What is the creature, what is its purpose, why is it attacking, why is it sabotaging the plane, not 100% sure to the reason behind the creature, I guess it's to draw up some excitement while we spend 50 minutes in the turret, but ignoring the endless issues about the creature we can move (or more skip to) onto the third plot the fact this is war times and the crew are flying somewhere near or not near Japanese forces, no clue as to where as we don't really get much information besides saying enemy forces aren't flying this far, as to where this is no clue. Now we've spent 50 minutes of the 1 hour 20 minute run in this turret, we've had these three plots randomly happen during this time, with an awful amount of time putting up with the worst dialog! After 50 minutes other characters are starting to spot the creature on the plane, seeing it rip apart the engines, with ease, and then for whatever reason it stops taking out the plane... the creature manages to get ahold the child in its briefcase and leaves it hanging off the side the broken engine. This is the moment we finally leave the turret for Chloe's character to break all the rules, the unforgettable scene which Chloe's character climbs easily upside down on this failing plane while flying, she climbs across the under parts of the plane to get the child back from hanging on that tiny bit of metal, if you ignore the fact the child doesn't fall out the bag, doesn't get hurt during this whole experience, and forget any laws of physics, this scene still doesn't make sense. All the while the creature has disappeared, we return to the war aspect with enemy planes easily shooting the location where Chloes character is hung or climbing whatever you want to call this, so we eventually make it back inside (FYI the turret at this point has fallen off) once back inside several characters have at some point died, we finally see the other characters on the plane. Skipping over the pointless fight with the creature mixed with the fighter planes several characters are just killed off, eventually the plane does this bonkers action where they have this idea to flip the plane upside down to flip it back and save the day... so they of course crash land, we have the final show down this the creature, but the attacking planes are somehow all dealt with. Forgetting the attacking planes and focusing on the creature, what is this creatures obsession with the child, why does it keep taking the baby and not kill the child or eat... in that final showdown, the bat like creature is for some reason afraid so attempts to run away but is then punched over and over again, all the while completely forgotten the fact the bat thing has massive claws it doesn't use... once it's dead, the film kinda just wraps things up and ends... the overall story seems to constantly flick between these three plot points, there's no character development or interaction beyond that annoying dialog exchange, we spend much the run time in the same location, there's no really comment on the editing or much else as the film is very limited, when you do get more verity in the scene the editing does then highlight as an issue with the quick jumps making some action moments hard to follow, camera angles weren't the best, honestly you could go on and on with the issues surround this film, I would like to find out the budget just out of interest, if your honestly wanting to watch this film it can be found for free on YouTube (if not been taken down - at time of review full film is available) but I personally wouldn't recommend unless you want to enjoy a bad film, it's such a shame the film falls completely flat as there could have been a great story to tell, why not look at true stories where women were involved in the war, there were so many better options to tell some great stories than this rubbish, it's listed as a Action, horror war film, the action is limited to the war aspect of the enemy planes, the horror is very very limited to the creature, and of course the war is just literally the war time period and enemy planes, the trailer is a complete lie. Good luck to you if you pain yourself through this experience, I honestly am disappointed as there really could have been a great strong female character story set in war times, instead were left with this...An additionally point I wish to make regarding the very start, firstly why did the plane land so briefly to be taking of within moments, there wasn't enough time to refuel, also did the plane make an extremely hard u turn without any aid, and pull up behind Chloe with ease, what was the point in the supernatural disappearing act by the person on the runway.... then if this was a secret mission that Chloe was on why would there be one character acting like such a prick about it, if you got orders that clearly state top priority mission you follow the orders. Also was the near miss meant to build some tension as it doesn't.",Shadow in the Cloud
172,Davidon80,Mysterious woman comes on board a bomber plane with orders from above.,6,12 June 2021,"A female officer joins a bomber crew on their flight to New Zealand, claiming she had orders from up top and a secret case she must deliver. Things hit a SNAFU and the plans go out the window.First of all it's worth mentioning that Gremlins are referenced in this movie, when you hear Gremlins you can only think back to the 80s classic and wonder if this is some strange hybrid prequel. Second thing worth mentioning, the callout to The Twilight Zone movie is another obvious harking back to the past, and once again the audience is thinking this is ""Nightmare at 20,000 feet"". Then the movie goes into its own territory, with an all action finale with a lot of mayhem and easy thrills. Chloe Grace Moretz gives a game performance as the secretive flight commander who may know more then she lets on and the action and script is serviceable, possible potential for more, but it does what it sets out to do and runs with it. I realized when reading through the trivia that Max Landis has a writing credit on this, and that makes sense. Whilst rumor has it his script was seriously edited, there is a little of the Landis sideways thinking still evident on the screen, how much exactly we will never know, suffice to say he is a writer who excels in blue sky thinking on genre pieces and knows how to wring an idea out of a maudlin premise. Also, Moretz should be commended, she's been a star ever since her foul mouthed debut in Kick Ass and somehow has hung in there and has kept making fun movies whilst looking every bit the movie star. This is a strong action turn for her where she shows a commanding range of emotions to what is quite a thread bare script.There's been a lot of negative criticism of this movie, and I am beginning to think that the reasoning is purely because the lead is female. I wonder if say Chris Prat was cast and the plot lines were altered for a male lead, would the fall out be as severe? I would bet my house on a no.The truth is the movie doesn't need defending, it is pure hokum from start to finish and has no pretension to be more than the sum of its parts. That being a flying bomber war movie, with a gremlin critter on board. Now what part of that description did you not like, this is essentially a throwaway comic book piece, the likes of which are made by the dozen, the mild twist being that is has a strong female lead: it's fun, it's action packed, it's got Gremlins and a WW2 bomber, what's not to love?

Nothing makes sense until you find out all the potentially cool stories you made up in your head were all wrong and ""what's in the box"" is really dumb. It's one of those films where the big reveal kills the movie. There's a lot of flaws up until then and all the macho banter is way over the top. I would say all the obnoxious stuff they say to her would have ruined the movie even if the overall story was good so the film is pretty badly flawed. Sadly the look is atmospheric and parts are done well. The script is painfully bad and as I say the twists are so dumb you get angry because the film might have been a 10 with a good script. It's obviously pretty low budget given she spends most of the film in a gun turret. The other characters are voice overs or shot against black for the bulk of the film. My guess is they only could get the plane for interior shots for one day. Most of the shots of crew are even against black.

Given I can't imagine any significant percentage of the population, movie going or otherwise, would find this entertaining, there must be some other agenda at work in portraying this twisted perspective of male behaviour.If perhaps the setting was a high security penal institution that catered solely for high level sex offenders, all of whom had been sectioned for ten or more years never having laid eyes on a female, then having Chole Moritz dropped in their midst, I could then perhaps speculate that such language and behaviour would be a close approximation of truth.The screenplay is ridiculous and even though Moritz does a good job with the dire script, the film is just a tragic mess.

183,gdalesmith,WASP with an attitude,7,3 January 2021,"This movie's premise, gremlins on a plane, would seem to put it in the superhero genre, like Wonder Woman or Batgirl. That's not a good fit, however. While Maude Garrett certainly has plenty of luck - starting with being unharmed after blithely walking under a bomber's wing as its propellers begin to spin - she doesn't have superpowers, or even a cape for that matter. She does have a leather jacket, kind of like Indiana Jones, but while Jones willingly puts himself in danger time and again, Moretz's character tries to evade it. So Shadow in the Cloud is somewhere between the two genres.Overall it's a fun watch, although the blatant social messaging gets wearisome at times. That said, Women Airforce Service Pilots ferried more than 12000 military aircraft of all types around the US during WW2, so a female piloting a B-17 shouldn't be a problem for viewers to accept. As for flying it upside down - well, there's nothing in the opening credits stating the movie is 'based on a real incident.'

The rest of the cast did a bang up job, the direction was awesome especially with most of the film in tight quarters.

They seem to think it's a historically accurate film when they should look at it as an adult fantasy. The writers borrowed an idea from the famous episode of the Twilight Zone with the creature on the aeroplane wing but handled better than the Twilight Zone episode I thought. They even managed to do a Mythbusters experiment where our lady falls out the plan but gets caught in an exploding Japanese plane and blown back through the opening she fell through. Mythbusters did this with dummies but it ended badly for the dummy. The package she takes on the plane is a very well behaved baby than manages to survive to the end of the film. The creature on the wing is a giant man sized bat which is pretty indestructible until the end. I really enjoyed this film for what it is a FANTASY well done Amazon Prime for making this.

Ohh, how wrong I was. It had a promising start with an interesting introduction of the characters. Now that I look back on it, was likely due to the low budget! But when it go into the story development and action about 2/3s the way thru, there were just too many impossible actions/accomplishments which added up to just being stupid and ridiculous. First - climbing across the underside of the wing of an in-flight bomber. Two - impossible physicals of a hanging basket in wind speeds exceeding 250+ mph. Three - falling OUT of the plane and an explosion pushing the heroine BACK INTO the plane. Oh, and the silliness does not stop there. A ludicrous crash landing AND an idiotic ending with the heroine being the mom who accomplishes all and still takes care of the child and defends them from evil. What horrid awful DRECK!Normally, I'm pretty tolerant of silly stuff (i.e. Evil Dead), but this was SO ridiculous it doesn't even qualify as entertaining anymore, verging on the insulting. What I don't understanding in how Ms. Moretz went along with so many obvious plot and mechanical issues with the storyline.Most directors working with material from comics typically work on building up the suspension of disbelief so that we go along with the impossible breakages of the laws of physics, thermodynamics, conservation of energy, etc. But this one goes so far beyond these limits (measured in light years) that the film just comes across as being stupid and ludicrous beyond possible definition.

224,commander_zero,An Outburst of Nonstop Cinematic Exuberance,9,10 May 2021,"Especially amid the oppressive, tedious days of the pandemic, perhaps it is time to award more points to filmmakers in popular genres for sheer exuberance. Roseanne Liang's Shadow in the Cloud boasts the simplest of monster-movie plots - in WWII New Zealand, a woman talks herself onto a bomber just in time for its pre-dawn takeoff, faces harrowing adventures involving Japanese fighter planes and batlike gremlins, and survives the bomber's crash landing onto a beach.This straightforward story, however, is enacted through a dizzying sequence that in other settings, would seem familiar but in Liang's hands takes on new life. First, the woman soldier, Maude Garrett (Chloe Grace Moretz), ostensibly just doing her job, is loudly desired, derided and insulted by the all-male crew. Then, when she is consigned to a machine gun turret in the plane's undercarriage, ""Shadow"" becomes a Locke-style one-person show where Maude only knows what's happening - and can only reveal herself - through what she says and hears through the intercom system. In fact, that's where we the viewers also get an idea of who each of the crew is as a person -their unseen bickering, jokes and instructions outline them more vividly than anything else in the film. When the bomber is attacked by Japanese fighter planes, Maude shows that she has the military experience the crew doubted, quickly changes accent and nationality, ups the stakes as the mysterious package she's guarding is revealed to be more important than any military secret, and becomes an action hero who makes Ellen Ripley in Aliens seem as if she's (to quote Maude herself) ""being polite.""
Plus, there are gremlins. To see Shadow in the Cloud is to recall the experience of its predecessor from a few years ago, What We do in the Shadows. They are both small-scale New Zealand productions that seemed to come out of nowhere, that take their respective genres in surprising new directions, and whose limited resources never seem threadbare, partly because the digital effects when needed, are used expertly. ""Cloud""'s action sequences range from painfully detailed realism - Maude breaks a finger keeping an attacking gremlin out of her turret - to credulity straining (broken finger and all but immune to wind and cold, she climbs along the bomber's fuselage in flight) - to action extravagances (Maude falls from the plane, and returns) worthy of Stephen Chow or for that matter, Chuck Jones, Fritz Freleng or Bob Clampett (only Bugs Bunny in Falling Hare had a WWII gremlin problem on the scale that Maude has).If Mahuia Bridgman-Cooper's score recalls earlier works in the genre, it is not the ominous Hans Salter Universal scores of the film's period, but 1980s Brad Fiedel and John Carpenter with their drones and squidgy synthesizer sounds. At 83 minutes long, Shadow in the Cloud is the perfect length to top a double bill, if whenever we return to cinema-going, there will be such things as double bills. It ends with a moment of essential motherhood and cuts immediately into a credits montage celebrating the roles of women in WWII, soundtracked by Kate Bush's Hounds of Love - the 1980s hit that begins with a voiceover from Jacques Tourneur's Night of the Demon. In the context of what has gone before, it is a crazily exhilarating sequence that keeps Shadow in the Cloud an outburst of sheer exuberance from start to finish.",Shadow in the Cloud

By far the best scenes were Chloe Grace Moretz locked in the ball-turret - it's an engaging performance that's ultimately let-down by a messy script.Once the film started explaining it's mysteries.. it lost me. Nothing about the bag's ""contents"" makes any sense - but perhaps it's not meant to. Pointless listing the logical flaws in the film, when clearly a lot of it is meant to just be symbolic.

They also proved they could handle any task as well as the men, including the heavy bombers that skeptics thought they were not strong enough to control. They built them in many cases, and performed every other task on the home front with equal skill, building aircraft and ships, doing the heavy lifting, welding, whatever it took, and doing it damned well.

Turns out i lost brain cells, as it's laughably bad, so much so I had to watch it to the end, as I was incredulous and curious about wether it would improve, but it just got more odd.I think it's meant to be 80's B movie bad, hence the heavy synth music and poor effects. I really hope that's the case as it just got weirder by the minute. Everything was poor; the script, the heavy handed misogyny, the acting (at one point Chloe reprimanded her colleagues for their remarks and she sounds like a teacher telling kids off, rather than an authoritive soldier), the effects (apart from the dog fights, they were cool), the storyline was terrible, just awful.I really hope I missed something and this was supposed to be a homage to old camp ott 80's horror, because if not I'm concerned about everyone's career in this. I'm sure there was a message about the indomitable spirit of womanhood, ""girls can do stuff now"" and the lengths we will go to protect our own, despite the blatant sexism and misogyny we experience and the odds being stacked against us, but if so it was jammed right in our faces and we were bludgeoned with it.It could also be viewed as a comedy as there are so many ""oh, come on!"" moments, my eyes rolled so hard they nearly popped out of my head.

244,anthonygiancola24,"It's Cartoon Logic, but I like that",7,13 February 2021,"Shadow in the Cloud is an action film directed by Roseanne Liang and starring Chloe Grace Moretz as WWII pilot Maude Garrett, who is transporting a top secret package aboard the Fool's Errand (funny name), a B-17 fighter plane. The crew, all men, are sexist pigs who don't think Maude has any business being on board, and stow her in the second gunner seat. However, also aboard the plane is a gremlin that wants to dismantle the plane and steal the package Maude has brought with her.The first 30-40 minutes of this movie were really great. The dialogue is flying, there is a ton of mystery, and one incredibly disturbing moment during a fight scene. Then, about halfway through, we learn what is in the package that Maude has with her. This is the moment where the film either loses you or wins you over. For me, I stayed with it, and it did pay off in the long run. However, I would be lying if I said I liked the second half more than the first. There is this seemingly endless action climax that just began to tire me out, and the actual ending just kind of meh'd itself out for me.(Side tangent: if you look at other reviews, there are so many people butthurt at the historical inaccuracy of this movie that has a Gremlin in it, and I have to laugh at them.)For the most part, we are locked in the turret with Maude, and Chloe Grace Moretz is really doing the Lord's work here because she has to play out scenes of dialogue with disembodied voices and react off of an imaginary creature. I do not envy her at all in this part, but she's honestly kind of giving the performance of her career. I mean I've never been the biggest fan, but she's kind of undeniable in this film.Maude is a very fun character to follow, and Roseanne Liang has a very unique perspective to share as a filmmaker. It's evident that this film had something of a lower budget, but the way Liang stylizes the budget restraints makes it all look and feel like a pulpy comic strip. It's just go go go, and the best parts of the climax are because of the way Liang shoots the films.The rest of the cast are all putting in a grade A effort, but other than Nick Robinson as Beckell, none of their characters really match the effort they're putting in. I mean not to belabor the point too much, but later in the film Maude encounters one of the crew and I audibly went ""who the hell is this?"" as I must have completely missed his introduction. The other hindrance being that other than one scene in the beginning, for the bulk of the film all the men are only heard over the comm system which made it a little hard for me to distinguish who was who.The last thing I want to talk about is the writing credit, and only because I think it's interesting. Max Landis wrote this script, and the project was in development before he was at the center of a metoo moment. I'm not going to get into it, but there are articles about the accusations if interested. There were no legal charges brought against Landis, but the studio wanted to avoid any bad press. So initially, Landis' name was completely scrubbed from the film, then it was back, and finally he and Roseanne Liang shared co-writing credit. Liang and Moretz disavowed Landis and claimed that the script was rewritten several times and was completely distanced from him.Well, that's a big fat lie lol.See, one of the notable things about Landis as a screenwriter is that (unlike many other screenwriters) most of his scripts are easily accessible online. Sometimes he even posts them himself. So as a little experiment I decided to compare the script to the film and...I don't know why Roseanne Liang gets a writing credit. Maybe it was just for PR, but I think it's really funny.There are two noticeably big changes to the script, and both I think were really funny. Not good, not bad, but I chuckled. Other than giving Moretz a British accent and rearranging the ending, the dialogue is almost verbatim from the script with a couple of cuts made for time. There were literally two lines of dialogue that appeared in the film that was not in the script.This is to take nothing away of Liang's work directing the film. The script is kind of a monstrosity to behold, and the way she made sense of the somewhat aimless stage directions is really impressive. I'm only bringing it up because I like to compare original scripts to the eventual film, and this one has a bit of a complex history behind it.",Shadow in the Cloud

Even dogfight scenes are shot from a point of view within the aircraft.I know that airworthy B17s are hard to find, but there's some well done CGI work by Weta in this film so why they didn't do some external shots is a mystery. It would have made the film visually far more interesting.Early in the film almost an hour goes by filmed entirely within the ball turret.A lot of people have criticised this, but I think they get away with it.Unfortunately the mysoginistic dialogue during most of that becomes tedious very quickly and is dragged on for far too long and is very badly written.Apparently the script was extensively re-written. I'd hate to think how bad the original was, because the finished work is dreadful.This film has plot holes a plenty, right from the odd disappearing ground crew on the runway at the start.Chloe's character, who looks like she might be an undercover SOE agent on a secret mission, turns out to be fleeing domestic violence.She turns out to be a WAAF officer with lots of hours flying ""unarmed aircraft, single handed"".Despite this, she turns out to be an absolute expert ball-turret gunner and very skillful martial artist.Oh yeah, that final fight scene with the creature (who's presence is never really explained).

Not one.There really wasn't any dialogue, or plot, and would have been better filmed as a silent movie, in Black and White with flash cards. No one in this film should have said a word. Not one, then this film may have stood a chance of being tolerable.The best part of the film was the plane explosion which pretty much sums up this films ability to fly. It didn't, and like the plane in the film, the whole movie crashed and burned.",Shadow in the Cloud

273,mjl1966,What happened here?,3,30 June 2021,"I love Chloë - loved her in Hit Girl, Carrie and Hick. Have wished for a long time that she would pick up more roles that let her showcase her talent.And for the first half of this movie, I found myself saying, ""Finally!""Young Maude Garrett hitches a ride on a B-17 with a mysterious McGuffin package and a cheeky attitude. Through a long sequence where Chloë puts on a marvelous performance from the confines of a ball turret, the tension and intrigue ramp up nicely. We learn she has some kind of backgroung where she has aquired some interesting skills. She knows all about how ball turrets work. She has a gun. And everyone has strict orders not to mess with the package she's brought on board.So, here we have a wonderfully ingriguing setup for what could have been a cool story about a mysterious woman on an important mission and who is obviously going to face all kinds of trials and tribulations along the way to demonstrate her prowess. The first half is a serious film that gives Chloë some killer scenes, including the use of various weaonry. Along the way, it's clear the writers ripped straight from (and I do mean straight from) Nightmare at 20,000 ft. But that's OK, because there is a deeper plot wrapped around the rip. Fine.But right at the middle, either the writer started smoking crack or somebody seriously tampered with the script. Maude is nobody special, no cool back story and the McGuffin turns out to be important only to her. She is reduced from heroine to just another girl in one scene flat. Then the story jumps the rails, goes over the cliff, into the river and out to sea.This COULD have been a good film and great showcase to refresh Chloë's career. Instead, everything that is set up in the first half is thrown away on a ridiculous plot and even more ridiculous theme. I felt I had been hoodwinked.I'm pretty sure that the final result isn't what Chloë read, because she deserves the first half but has done nothing to deserve the sheer torment of the second half. It literally becomes laughable.We also proceed to witness more rips from various films that are as lazy as they are unnecessary. I counted at least four. There are probably more.I did like the cool totally analog film score. Too bad that, too, was wasted.This was a movie that could have been and was carelessly thrown away.",Shadow in the Cloud

There is a lot of really boring content out there on various streaming services and it is hard to find gems or fun things that are AT LEAST just the right size.Was there room for improvement ? Yes.Did it do most things right however ? Yes. Over all it pulled itself together, and that is something in itself.There are a number of things to complain about, just, don't do that, and try to enjoy it.The pace of the whole thing is appropriate for the places where it is otherwise lacking. Saving grace (no pun), the movie was not too long.This is because some of the special effects are clearly just there for the story and do not entirely make scientific sense. ( wind speed, etc., ) A bigger budget may have fixed those, but, really, would it have been necessary ? I don't think so. I think the budget was actually right sized for the story.This whole issue of how long it is, how fast it goes, and how fun it is, is balanced and that's why it needs a bit more than 4.8 (relative to today's content in general) stars.If I could improve one thing about it as cost effectively as possible, it would be several of the dialogue sequences (writing thereof). I saw the potential there and maybe that is why I am being generous, because, again, everything else seemed to come together (well enough) in the time (and presumably budget) allotted.The performances of the talent were all very good, but this was not a movie to showcase a lot of that, perhaps other than for the protagonist who did a good job carrying the brunt of the story in close-up.",Shadow in the Cloud

303,Mamabadger56,Nice Try,6,11 January 2021,"To get to the heart of the matter, this is a less than stellar film that would be far worse in different hands. It's hard not to cheer for the filmmakers and cast, who do an admirable job with flawed material.During WWII, the Allies regularly trained pilots from women's auxiliary branches of their nation's air force. Meant to provide simple transport of empty planes to airfields, the flights did sometimes cross enemy territory, and had to be completed with minimal navigation and no means of defence. The women performing this task had to be brave, alert, and resourceful, prepared for the worst even if not supplied with the equipment to deal with it. This is the foundation for director/screenwriter Roseanne Llang's Shadow in the Cloud, a suspenseful horror/thriller with feminist overtones, taking place almost entirely aboard an American Air Force flight in the latter part of WWII. The film takes the trouble to give recognition to the women's auxiliary forces which inspired the story, through clips of their training and work shown over the final credits.Chloe Grace Moretz plays Maude Garrett, a WAAF officer assigned, at the very last moment before flight, to a B-17 bomber. She brings with her the first of multiple mysteries: cargo she is guarding and is forbidden by her superior officer to open or identify. The all-male crew are outraged at her being assigned to their plane, and argue furiously over whether they should allow her on board or not. They finally permit her on the flight, but secure her in the ball turret, placing her secret package under guard in the cockpit.Tension builds as the crew's attitude toward Garrett ranges from suspicion to lewd threats. Their narrow-minded refusal to accept Garrett as a genuine pilot endangers them all, when she attempts to convince them something is strangely amiss with the plane, and they ignore her warnings. Threats to the crew move from normal but alarming wartime dangers, to the unearthly and monstrous, as the storyline gears up into intense, nonstop action and one source of danger is followed by another.As the mysteries of Garrett's identity, the real reason for her presence on the flight, and the nature of her classified cargo are gradually revealed, she begins to earn the men's grudging respect by acting to salvage the plane and rescue the crew, through a series of extravagantly heroic acts.The film is a mixed bag. The story itself is unimpressive, beginning with a fairly solid wartime thriller, but adding supernatural horror elements that seem both out of place, and absurd. The use of CGI is too awkward to provide the horror element it aims for. The action plotline becomes outlandish enough to outweigh the suspense and excitement of the crew's ongoing struggles, especially during the overblown and ill-considered final scenes, which attempt to make a point about female determination and heroism but go a bit too far and in a strange direction. The film works as a slightly preposterous thriller, watched just for fun, if parts of the story are taken with a very big grain of salt.However, the film deserves credit for its successes and the effort put into its details. The lengthy scenes, more than half the film, in which Garrett is secluded in the narrow ball turret compartment are managed well. It provides a claustrophobic feeling as the oncoming threat is identified, and uses creative filming techniques to indicate what is happening outside, without actually taking the camera from Garrett. The crew's voices coming through Garrett's earphones keep the audience apprised; and when their action is unclear, we are shown brief flashes of the speculation taking place in Garrett's mind to fill in the blanks, an effective device under the circumstances.Chloe Grace Moretz does an admirable job with the prolonged, isolated, one-person scenes, many of which consist entirely of her character's silent reaction to events; and with a character who must try to move plausibly (and too often) from heroine to victim and back to heroine again. Her performance, the creative visual storytelling, and Roseanne Liang's work as director go some way toward balancing out the unfortunate script.",Shadow in the Cloud

309,mlwcsc,This movie doesn't know what it is,4,6 June 2021,"So I see that this movie has received rather mixed reviews with several people absolutely hating it and other people shaking their heads at the people that hate it and calling it a good bit of fun. Personally I understand both points of view.The thing that I believe is causing the many bad reviews is that this film has some rather major tonal shifts. It starts out playing as a relatively straight forward war movie with a mysterious female passenger suddenly being added to a flight at the last moment and all the conflict that would cause.Then we get a bit into the movie and the gremlin is introduced. Now if you weren't prepared for the gremlin to be a big part of the movie, that would likely throw you off quite a bit, but not enough to really ruin the movie. I mean a war movie on a plane with a gremlin, alright.But then we get the next tonal shift. It turns out that the female passenger isn't, as the movie largely tries to make you believe, a secret agent, but rather a blind passenger and the mysterious package she was carrying was actually a baby in a box...that's right a baby...in a box. Oh and the father? One of the airmen on board the plane. So here we have a few scenes where we suddenly have an emotional subplot where we learn that the woman is fleeing an abusive husband and is fearful for her life.So alright, they just added some drama to the war movie, alright, but nope, we get another shift and now it is suddenly 100% cartoony action for the rest of the movie, including people climbing the outside of the plane, an enemy plane exploding and throwing someone back into the plane, oh and of course the plane flying upside down for a bit.These tonal changes would very likely cause a lot of people to experience a severe case of whiplash and, if someone had actually gotten invested in the early bits of the movie where it seemed to take itself semi seriously, make them really dislike the second half.Now if you can get past that then the movie is still kinda meh to be honest. The cgi is so-so, especially the parts outside the plane and while some of the action is alright, there really isn't enough of it to justify the movie.The one thing I will say is pretty spot on, is the acting of Chloë Grace Moretz. She honestly does a pretty darn good job with what she is given and it kinda left me wondering what the heck she was doing in a movie like this, because honestly, she should be in better movies.",Shadow in the Cloud

Yet, beyond some intense scenes, it's a lackluster over-the-top film with no sense of direction.Even to the point where; perhaps intentional - it's comedic, and poorly executed. At first it gives a sense that the story in itself would have some heartfelt impact - yet it's dragged down by a lack of taking itself seriously: both visually and narratively.",Shadow in the Cloud

I was hoping that this was more about the women who played an essential part of WW2 with a more modern take that Maude is privy to classified plans to take down the enemy. But no, other than have to deal with misogynistic blokes on the plane she pushed herself on to, the twist that happened more than half way into the film was ok, but I did wonder how a leather bag (and woolly blankets) could protect a baby that almost never made a sound. I assume the horror tag in the genre was in reference to the bat like creatures but it made me more confused. There was no backstory about where they could have come from, nor was there any conclusion at the end when Maude punched the living lights out of one. It just felt that a creature was dumped into the story without much thought. I like Chloe as an actor (she was the reason why I wanted to watch it), didn't have a problem with the direction of the film (I liked the cut away scenes while Maude was in her cubby hole) but I think the story was awful and I recommend that you do something else with your time.",Shadow in the Cloud

324,joshuarenealvarez,Shadow in the Cloud (2021),7,23 March 2021,"Shadow in the Cloud is an action-fantasy film
co-written and directed by Roseanne Liang. The film had it's world premiere at the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People's Choice Award for Midnight Madness. Set in World War II,
a female flight officer is assigned to travel with top-secret documents from Auckland, New Zealand to Samoa. The duration of the storyline takes place in her transport, the B-17 bomber, where she is ridiculed for being a woman. The crew primarily dominated by men. Right from the beginning, the narrative inserts gender politics. This didn't seem to trouble me at first because I'm sure that many women had to experience this form of verbal abuse during this time-period. But it became excessive to the point where it was repetitive and irritating. I felt bludgeoned
with the overall message that I had already understood Roseanne Liang was trying to convey to the audience. Be that as it may, I was ultimately entertained by this film due to the leading performance of Chloë Grace Moretz who brought her own level of charisma into the role of Maude Garrett, and the plot which devolved into one
of the most illogical and preposterous scenarios that I have ever witnessed in my life. This raised my amusement. But I found myself unintentionally laughing during emotional scenes as I could not take this film seriously whatsoever. The cinematography by Kit Fraser was a
visual sight-to-see and the soundtrack composed by
Mahuia Bridgman-Cooper with it's synthesizers
and techo beats gave the film an 80's
atmosphere,
in addition to it's setting. I believe the film achieved it's goal to keep
the onlooker attentive as a part-war flick,
part-social commentary, and part-creature feature.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez

This is actually a theme of the movie which is unnecessary and all very predictable.She has a package on her which needs to be protected at all costs - what it contains is laughable.

Very menacing.The movie takes a sharp turn south when you find out the secret ""package"" that Garrett (Moretz) is carrying turns out to be her infant child which she is apparently trying to smuggle out of the country. Oh and the baby's father is on board the flight, although at first he doesn't even realize he has a baby. The scene as she admits this all over the radio, in flight, in the middle of battle, is one of those classic Hollywood blunders where death and destruction hit the pause button so the characters can slowly develop the plot into something far less interesting than what the viewer was expecting.This movie turns into a hysterical comedy after that. With amazing gags like Garrett climbing outside the plane while in flight and scaling the bottom of the aircraft to save her baby from falling. Culminating with her losing her grip, falling from the airplane about 100 feet, directly onto a Japanese Zero that is flying by, which explodes, AND BLOWS HER BACK INTO THE B-17, UNHURT. LMAO.

I get the haste when a movie's good but I'm not buying that they're altruistically helping others avoid ""wasting their time"" (as if watching TV is often constructive). Grumpy grumpy. Just a tip: when something's awful maybe let your opinion percolate a bit just in case you missed something.I'm not a frequent reviewer but I liked this one. Saw it on Hulu so wasn't exactly anticipating high quality cinema. It was advertised as an actiony popcorn movie and definitely delivers. I would avoid the preview. I don't blame whoever made it, tricky movie to tease, but it gives you too much and could be inadvertently misleading. And it kinda spoils the crescendo of one of the tenser moments.The basic gist is a female officer gets added last minute to a bomber crew, has a secret package, gets put in the bottom turret and has to fight Axis pilots and furry gremlin critters. Sure there's end up being a bit more to it but it pretty much is what it is. I just don't see how you could watch the trailer/want to see it but find it unsatisfying. There's plenty of action, no real lag moments, a bit more going on than seems but no big twisty thing to ponder. There's a brief faux-newsreel in the beginning that establishes rumored gremlins but it isn't clear if that's just a metaphor for mistakes/stuff happens. Doesn't matter though, clearly there be critters on this particular plane.Characters can be confusing as much of the dialogue is over the bomber's intercom. However I really wouldn't rewind a lot or sweat knowing who's who; isn't very important. The crew is essentially the captain, a nice guy, a young guy and a bunch of caricature mysognists. Oh and a copilot from I think New Zealand to generate some abstract racism. Oh and a belligerent Scot. Anyway yeah, our heroine is hitching a ride on this big flying sausage party and she's gotta protect herself and her package from gremlins, Japanese fighter pilots and some ahole gargoyles. Which she does pretty well. Crawling around the bottom of a flying plane is a bit of a stretch but compared to most movies nothing to critique.My guess is the majority of downvoters: have issues with a strong female lead (she ends up much more capable than the others), general aircraft/WWII authenticity (just watching Saving Private Ryan again and let it go), and/or the people that preemptively downvoted Captain Marvel for whatever deranged reason. I guess they can accept tough females (characters) but only if they don't know they're tough or get too ""uppity"" (though if it's a guy they're just forgivably ""macho""). I don't really know or care but it'd be nice if movie ratings had something to do with whether the actual movie was good rather than anticipating a perceived agenda or whatever's going on.I recommend it, best movie I've seen in the last couple weeks and best fun action movie in even longer (though I am picky and won't watch something just for the sake of watching something i.e. I'm not a professional)",Shadow in the Cloud

It is both fiction and Sci-fi, which makes reference to the classics of The Twilight Zone.

Her career is definitely not on the decline as many of the comments wanted to show.
Once again, Chlöe Moretz makes a strong woman and maintains her post as an action actress.Please leave the machismo in the bag and enjoy this action movie.

But after watching a little more I was saying to myself 'Oh, yeah, there it is, it makes sense now'.The movie really struggles with an identity. It's like they decided to switch gears for every act. That's it's main problem. A close second is that there's a few really over the top action sequences that would've seemed ridiculous if you had seem them performed by Tom Cruise's super spy character in the Mission Impossible series, and they certainly have no place in a movie like this, where the characters are normal people. It really took me out of the movie.There were some script problems as well - the behavior of the flight crew wasn't believable, the reason for getting the main character onto the flight in the first place, and how the threat-level of the monster changed as the movie's focus changed. One thing that sticks out is that after the main character's first serious encounter with the monster, she literally doesn't even mention it to the rest of the crew, who remain blissfully unaware of the magnitude of the threat.

370,lezboyd,Good enough budget movie to pass the time,8,13 January 2021,"It's a good enough movie. The plot is pretty simple, and typical itna budget movie that takes place in an enclosed environment - in this case, a plane. It's a series of hurdles to overcome one after another, sometimes concurrently.But I liked the unique twist that's set up right at the beginning and pays off throughout. The background score is my kinda music. The acting, or in most cases, the voice-acting was pretty good. If you survive the initial phase where our protagonist is 'trapped' in the turret, then the movie holds your interest all throughout and delivers some good enough action. It's not 'Kick-Ass / Hit-Girl' level of action from Grace Moretz but it's good enough for the setup of this movie.However, there are two parts that distinctly drag on. First is her stuck in the turret, and the second is where she is rescuing a 'package'. Those parts could've been cut down a little to keep the pace brisk, and still could've effectively conveyed the messages they were trying to convey.But other than that, I liked the movie overall. IMHO, has repeat viewing potential.8/10 for me.",Shadow in the Cloud

Then they jump the shark.Yes, the Gremlin is more believable than the mid movie reveal. Decided to make up my own ending.Turns out she's CIA, trying to deliver a captured gremlin artifact that could stop Japan weaponising the creatures against the Allies. All the crew except the one that wasn't horrendously sexist are brutally torn apart, she uses the artifact. Officially Queen of the gremlins. Furry hugs all round. Happily ever after. She takes a submarine home, final jump scare from the uber German gremlin that is for some inexplicable reason wearing an SS uniform..Still a better love story than twilight",Shadow in the Cloud
372,big_hair_x,"Promising Start, then things just got progressively more dumb",2,1 August 2021,"For a moment I thought they were going to have the whole film from her point of view in the ball turret and it seemed really interesting. The idea of hearing the plane getting torn to shreds whilst trapped in the most vulnerable position, only able to communicate with the rest of the crew and provide observations of what was around them out and instructions on how to fix damage. It could've been claustrophobic, tense as both she and the audience have to work out what's going on through the radio, and scary as her imagination plays tricks on her and us.The mystery of what was in the box was also intriguing. It would've been great if they'd pulled a Pulp Fiction with it, never actually revealing what it really was.They presented the character of Maude as a capable flight officer with knowledge of engineering and real questions about her as to why she faked her papers. More than enough for an interesting character.It was all gearing up to be really interesting...Then suddenly there was a baby on board.Oh.Couldn't we've stuck with one theme and rolled with it? Mystery person trying to deliver something vital for the war effort, trapped in a plane being torn apart by gremlins. That by itself sounds like a great film!But no. Now there's a baby, and an accompanying sob story where she correctly highlights why the guy on the crew left her (she cheated on her husband with him and never told him she was pregnant). I wouldn't mention this if later in the film she hadn't appeared to be trying to guilt trip him about leaving her.Anyway, things have taken a decidedly soap-opera-esque twist but maybe this is... Oh. The gremlin took the baby.Why?And now Maude is climbing out of the plane. On the underside. Whilst in flight. To retrieve the baby box by hanging upside down on a cable to grab the baby with a large bit of plane she just... She just pulled that out of the plane! Is that not an important bit of plane?Oh, I forgot to mention they're also being attacked by multiple enemy fighters at this point. Because that might as well happen.Anyway, she makes her way back, pausing mid climb in a hole in the wing, I guess, to make sure the baby is alive, then continues on to climb back into the plane. Precariously leaving the baby package on the edge of the hole she climbs through, she has to pull herself up but clearly, on top of flight training and engineering, she's been practicing for Ninja Warrior! Deftly, she pulls herself up, then immediately falls out again, heading for the ground with no way back to the... Nope. She's not falling to her death. She's being blown BACK into her plane by an explosion of an enemy fighter.What.Surprisingly unharmed by the explosion, she jumps up and starts issuing orders to the group of men who had started the film by being obnoxiously sexist. One by one they get their comeuppance for their OTT sexism from earlier, being torn to shreds by gunfire and the like.Finally, she successfully crash lands the plane, narrowly getting everyone out before it explodes.The gremlin makes a final appearance and all the men stand back as she Kung Fu kicks its ass to death, overpowering the bizarre monster despite it clearly having more muscle in one arm than she had in her while body. She cuts it's throat with it's own claw, then stops to breastfeed the baby in front of everyone which would be fine in the 21st century but probably would have preferred some privacy in 1944.So... Flight officer, aviation engineer, free climber, aerial stunt woman, incredible core strength, ninja warrior, Kung Fu master, and mother. I'm not even including the two planes she shot down, the first aid she performed on herself, the psychiatric advice she was offering before being told to shut up, or the incredible ability to avoid all shrapnel and bullets.Roll credits to a very cool but entirely inappropriate 80s synth score. We finish with some shots of real world war 2 female pilots, completely undermining their very real contribution to the war effort by associating it with this absurd piece of trash.How about actually making a film about those women without adding all the extra noise? One star for being Pro breastfeeding despite the very conservative time period, and another for the awesome music that should have been in another film.",Shadow in the Cloud

So there I am, upside down and gripping the wing of a Boeing 747 as I desperately try and save my French bulldog that I've smuggled on board in my carry on luggage. Oh..forgot to mention, Gremlins had torn apart the overhead storage compartment (and various other parts of the plane) and my Frenchy had fallen out of the main fuselage and was hanging, precariously by a strap from the wing of the Qantas plane. Thankfully I'd trained my grip strength with several years of intense practice where I would hang from the wings of aircraft whilst they travel at several hundred km per hour over international waters. Anyways, thanks to my superior grip strength and unquestionable love for my dog, I managed to save Mr. Shnookiwookems (my Frenchy) and clamber back to the cabin where I enjoyed a lovely meal and a lengthy chat with 76yr old retiree, Gwendolyn (she was making her way to Manchester for an international knitting summit). As I sat there, chewing the fat with Gwen I thought ""U know what - this would make a pretty good movie with all the Gremlins trying to crash the plane and steal my pets stuff that's going on.."" . So I sold the rights to a production company and several years later... ""Shadow in the Cloud."" The film took a few editorial liberties.

400,DerRalf,Could have been so good...,5,2 January 2021,"I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. A war movie with supernatural elements gets me every time.
During the first and second act this movie is nothing short of brilliant. A beautiful female flight officer carrying a mysterious package which she is to protect at all costs encounters a real life gremlin.
Just like William Shatner in the famous Twilight Zone episode ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" she has to persuade the rest of the crew to believe her. Since her reactions to this encounter are completely cool and controlled, I always had the impression, that she knew about these creatures beforehand, and that her mission concerning the mysterious package had something to do with them.
Boy, was I wrong about that.
When the third act begins, everything is turned on its head. And this is done quite clumsily by overuse of exposition. It turns out, the creatures, the package and the mission are completely unrelated, and seemingly out of nowhere there is a quite unfitting love story, which is the reason for everything (except the gremlin, which at this point becomes quite superfluous and unnecessary). This is very dissapointing.
As far as information about the production is available at this moment, the script underwent heavy rewrites. I guess that is the reason why the third act of this movie (which had such a promising start and superb second act), just falls apart.
Do yourself a favor, and leave before the package is opened. Try to imagine a grand finale in which the package contains a method to fight gremlins but at a dire cost. No matter what your imagination will come up with, it will be a superior ending to what this movie tries to offer you.",Shadow in the Cloud

I found it a fun adventure with some style and grace that will please fans of pulp-scifi and movies that know when to end.Unfortunately, Max Landis(credibly accused of some nasty stuff) was involved at some point in the writing of this script.

410,frosteliza,Watch it just for the action sequences,7,1 January 2021,"Enjoyable sky romp, with some edge-of-the-seat action sequences in a disintegrating bomber. At first the heroine is trapped in the lower gun turret and has the film largely to herself whilst tension mounts with the rest of the crew over the intercom and the plot gradually unfolds. In the latter part of the film, she escapes in specatacular fashion and becomes an action heroine to rival Ripley and Sarah Connor.There's nothing wrong with the film as an over-the-top action adventure (although it does take itself a bit too seriously) - the problem is that the supernatural element seems to have been added as an afterthought, perhaps so the marketing people could add to the films appeal. The gremlin is shown in full CGI glory far too early, comes as no surprise whatsoever, and is actually entirely superfluous to the main plot. Everything that happened could have been more realistically attributed to either the attacking aircraft, or technical malfunction.There is a lot of twaddle in the reviews here about female WWII aircrew - but from the closing credits it is made obvious that there were quite a lot around, and if they weren't normally involved in combat that was more likely a policy decision than a decision based on ability - just as in today's military.OK, the woman/superhero/good, man/weakling/bad thing is a bit OTT, but that's the film industry at the moment, and - lets face it - no-one complained when Ripley blew the alien out of the airlock.Summary: worth watching.

I can't say anything about the acting abilities of the other actors, they don't have enough screen time to leave a lasting impression. The CGI is somewhere between acceptable and horrible (the scene where Maude throws boxes through the open bomb hatch, trying to hit a gremlin is especially bad) and the other special effects tend to be more or less ridiculous. The story and directing have an extremely high chance of winning the Razzie award this year.I normally compare bad movies to the worst movie I own as a DVD, which is Surf Nazis must Die, a very bad 1987 Troma movie.

After all, we easily suspend our disbelief when The Rock, Arnie, and Stallone play indestructible warriors (not to mention Tom Cruise).However, as the movie went along, suspension of disbelief became more and more impossible.The spider-walking upside down on the outside of a plane mid-flight; the contents of a mysterious box that managed to remain a mystery for more than five minutes; the final fight scene between our hero and a gremlin.

This movie was well shot, had an amazing 80's synth soundtrack, had fantastic acting, and was just pretty damn cool.

The screen play and soundtrack I loved! Kinda reminded me of a J.J Abrams project like overlord. I loved how they introduced the characters even tho they rushed there deaths and didn't need to being that they had good character development. Movie was just to short. Chloe moretz acting was top notch like always and she did the best she could for what was written for her. I see a lot of complaints on the vulgar language from the gentlemen but I'm sure men back in that day and age felt that way about women doing men things. Only complaint I have about those scenes is it took to much of the movie sense it is not very long in the first place.

Chloe's character (can't even bother to remember the name) wandering around with a box. And when she finally boards a plane, you get a glimpse of what could be a spy on a secret mission.Then weirdness all over. She is being told to go sit in the lower turret, leaving her secret mission box behind as she can not possible take it in the small turret. She does complain a bit about leaving her secret mission box behind and keeps reminding everyone not to open the box. Great story line so far.A lot of chatting about nothing, then a gremlin shows up and finally someone opens the box that seems to contain a baby - a result of Chloe's character running away from a violent husband and a guy that happens to be on the same plane she boarded in the very misty airport ...Could have taken the baby story or the gremlin story, but not both.Not sure whether the gremlin shows up to steal the baby (as it appears to be doing at the end of the movie), but well, as if running away with a baby on a random plane from a very misty airport is not the worst idea, fighting a gremlin in mid air, doing wall-climbing exercises on the bottom of the plane whilst getting shot at and eventually throwing random objects at a man-sized bat just makes it into one horrible episode of SNL where they try to make fun of Gremlins, Airplane, Con-Air and Broken all at once.On your mark, set, terrible.

462,ajtomo,Do not watch if male with ego of tissue paper,7,5 January 2021,"So many times in my life I've felt ashamed or embarrassed at being male - reading these reviews was one such time. What is wrong with these people. ""Couldn't have a female pilot in those days"" - ""Why are all the men men shown as male chauvinists? Typical woke feminist propaganda!"" - ""No way would a woman with her training be able to shoot a plane down like that!"" - ""Oh look - an actual gremlin attacking the plane. Now that will put them in a bit of bother.""
If you're more concerned with the unlikeliness of a strong female pilot and with there being no way on earth she could possibly be as good a shot with the plane's guns as she is, or that men are being shown making lewd sexist comments (in the '40s! In the armed forces!) and dismissing a woman losing her temper for no reason that's apparent to them as simply hysterical (again, in the 1940s! Not to mention that the word hysterical was coined to describe a woman's ""lack of equanimity"" during menstruation or birth - including ante and post, and just in general - blaming it on her hormones and womb etc (hysterus, hysterectomy, hysterical) and being labelled hysterical would often lead to a hysterectomy) than the unlikeliness of a gremlin - an actual creature that is purely fictitious and, well, unreal - attacking the plane, then you've got your notions of what's realistic and what isn't just a bit messed up!
The film's clearly a ""don't just suspend your disbelief, please leave it outside altogether"" rollercoaster ride not to be taken in the least bit seriously. (I'll bet not many people picking holes in this start whingeing when Captain America frisbees his shield at some security agent who just goes flying back, instead of being sliced in two as would be far more likely to happen).It's so sad that people have got too many hang ups to just enjoy a bloody film on its own terms - in this case those people seem to be pretty much all male. And the thing is, all the male characters are redeemed before the (or their) end - even the patronising Scottish one ('just look after ye baby, woman!' before falling out of the plane - trust me, in the film that's a redeeming line, showing he's on her side at last and takes her seriously). And as for the initial general behaviour of the men towards the woman - there are still pubs round here, getting on for a century later, full of that sort of crap going on, especially when there are no women around - it's awful, but I bet it's not the only place in the world.Considering the year we've had, not to mention the dearth of escapist films, this film's almost a breath of fresh air, and none of the genres mixed into this film are ones I'd go out of my way to watch. It doesn't pretend to be anything it's not, it adheres to its own inner logic (which is more than can be said for many highly praised films), and it's not a documentary, or even cinéma vérité, and you're not going to mistake it for a Ken Loach or Mike Leigh film, so stop treating it (and other films) as though they're meant to be gritty social realism.Grow up and act like a child for once.",Shadow in the Cloud

The rest, sadly, is utterly predictable because it's trying so hard to be unpredictable.The dialog demonstrating how men treated women back in the 1940s is important and edifying to the plot, and the script writers or editors could easily have done away with almost all of it once the point was made. Re-making the same ""men think dames are for sex because they're incompetent & hysterical"" point over and over does not add any value to the movie.Chloe gets to show off her wide range of acting skills, including some nice accent work and the bad-ass action style that made me fall into fandom back in Kickass.Sadly, the story is cliched and appears to use the gremlin as an allegory for her abusive husband. And everyone gets to fight this little monster. Speaking of which, the cartoon to start the movie off was also heavy-handed, and made it all too clear what the antagonist was going to be, including how it would be dismissed by disposable supporting characters.Quite frankly, movies about saving one or two people at all costs, even if those costs include the deaths of more than the number saved, is played out. Which of course means Hollywood will keep churning them out.I give the acting, mostly hers, eight or nine stars. A couple of the guys bring that number down. To be fair, their parts are so poorly written there wasn't much that could be done about that.The sets, colors, and photography are balanced, time-period consistent, and do not distract from the story. The music, however, was a poor match for the movie. It was mostly overly synthesized, and dripping with whatever emotion the scene should've been able to convey on it's own. As if making up for the lack of story elements.I enjoyed it, and may even watch it again, mainly because of Moretz. That said, fast-forwarding will definitely happen.",Shadow in the Cloud

482,anbarimasoud,watch the end of an era,2,22 January 2021,"First & for most, this is a terrible movie. Now that we've got that out of the way, I should mention that it is difficult to make movies during a pandemic, it is very difficult to make thriller movies, and it has always been very difficult to make decent horror movies. All these difficulties come together in this movie & have turned trying to watch it into an exhausting ordeal.
The storyline is completely flat & repetitious; even the scary moments are cliche. Were it not for the pandemic/quarantine/semi-depression trifecta, no studio manager would have even read the script thoroughly, let alone making a movie out of it. The decision to make this movie has most probably been a test run to see the effects of new health regulations on a final product. And the final product is disappointing.
The cast & crew have all tried their best efforts to do their jobs, and they have done it properly. Cloë Grace Moretz especially, has challenged herself & pushed her boundaries as an actor. All the people who have chosen a profession related to theater & movie industries, are currently obliged to rediscover & reshape their abilities & standards a new; and the actors & makers in this movie have tried their best.
E for effort, to sum it all up, is the shortest & best phrase to describe ""Shadow in the Cloud."" But I need to thank all those involved in making of this movie, for they have shown me that the time of interest in superstitious stories is coming to an end. Stories based on conspiracy theories may still hold a portion of the market for the next couple of decades, but after the year we have all been through, with all the deceit, stress, isolation, and lack of crucial information to begin with, the only stories that truely attract me from now on are the ones based on, about, or exploring historic truths & scientific subjects. This movie helped me say farewell to that part of my personality which got its entertainment from superstitious nonsense and emotional upheavals.

483,ldickinson-1,Comic Book and Twilight Zone meet,8,13 April 2021,"A brilliant and imaginative blend of archetypal comic book right down to the reddish-hued Roll Call of characters, touched with sci-fi reminiscent of the Twilight Zone. Pulse-pounding background tracks set the tone and then meander though the desperate, isolation, confusion, concern when the eyes see what can't be believed, fear when they see what can be believed, determination against the impossible, and all choreographed with staccato down to the note, to coincide with the action. An unbelievable piece of art. Casting and scripting created believable characters who raised tension while not detracting from the story and kept the attention centered on Flight Officer Maude Garrett played by Chloë Grace Moretz. Long, sans-dialogue sequences of Maude required an actress who could tell a story with nothing but facial expression and body language-Chloë Grace is one of the best in Hollywood. Exceptional close-up camera work caught every tick of Chloë's features and caught the detail of her confined work environment to heighten the isolation and her surreal predicament. As an aside, I've watched several on-screen actresses who are skilled in the presentation of martial arts, contortion, grappling and wrestling gymnastics-Chloë Grace among them-but, no other woman in the business can put up her dukes and throw a punch with the physicality and believability of Chloë Grace.",Shadow in the Cloud

493,dallenatwork,I felt this movie could be a bit more powerful,1,24 February 2021,"I agree with a lot of reviews that state our heroine is one tough gal. She starts off very confident, able to get on the all-male crew, tell them that she's on a top secret mission, and on top of that she can talk on the same level as them so they know she's not to be messed with. She's also very tough in terms of protecting her baby from the evil gremlin. She's ready to attack, even climb an airplane, shoot down airplanes, and do even worse to make sure her baby is safe. By the end of the film, she's very sure of herself. She could chase down the nastiest of monster that can rip apart airplanes and beat it to death if it came between her and her baby.But there is a fatal flaw to this incredible woman. She can't face her former husband who abuse her, and even more so he could beat her to death if he wanted to. She turns into this defeated woman who can't even defend herself from the abuse of her husband. I feel like this film could had so much more in terms of empowerment of women in abusive relationships. The truth is abusers have a powerful spell over their victims. I known in real life several great women who could do extraordinary things, sort of like Chloe in this film, but as soon as they go home to their abusive husband, they can't escape that life. It takes a lot to get out of a relationship especially if you built it around the idea that your significant other will complement your life and the two of you can go forward to do great things. I feel like this movie could have Chloe face her abuser and on top of that come out strong to escape the abusive relationship. Not only that, put it in such a way that the pressure is on the abusive person as well to show that if you keep doing what you're doing, expect to create a much stronger person that will defeat you someday.Instead I felt this movie sort of focused on Chloe doing all sorts of great deeds as an escape method from her abusive path. I felt like all those things she done to the monster and plane, could instead be focused on the right person.I probably missed it but I thought she was in the British airforce and I'm not quite sure they would be attacked by Japanese fighters flying in Europe.

501,therealadambeck,"Actually pretty alright, until it isn't",6,7 August 2021,"The film actually holds up surprisingly well... Yup, surpriiiisingly well ... until it doesn't. If you decide to give it a whirl, you'll know exactly when that moment hits.Nope. No, it's not that one. Yeah, there you go. That's the one.Up until then the film plays out with a reasonable amount of mostly-grounded suspense. It gives some tense moments, inventive plot devices, and solid camera work, combining clastrophobic WWII-era spaces with modern composition and lighting. Even when things begin to tip towards creature-shooty territory, the film manages to keep its feet on the ground and sets up some decent thrills.That said, viewer: be prepared!Sharks will be jumped and you'd best be ready to leap along lest you scoff yourself hoarse. Hear that, brain? Crank down that logic centre, cram some gauze over your guffaw hole and sit back for 80ish minutes of zany airborne shenanigans.To be frank, even with a goofy script, even with over-the-top physics-defying tomfoolery, the actors do a good job with what they're given. Performances don't lack, even when the dialogue doesn't give them much to work with. Moretz does a great job of filling the screen with her performance. She believeably pulls off some physically-demanding moments, even when the greenscreen is clearly not putting in the same effort. Her British accent isn't half-bad, either.That said, the film is...it's fine. The plot is flimsy, the dialogue is loose, and the story is ok.Oh, but that music. It's ... it's something. In and of themselves they are good songs. However, most of them absolutely do not fit in the scenes in which they're stuffed. It's often extremely difficult to figure out what tone you're meant to take from a scene. Is this penultimate moment supposed to be goofy? Scary? Suspenseful? Feel dangerous? Damn, I don't care, just go with ambient noise because the director's Spotify playlist is not working.There's also a message that's clearly being broadcast by this film. Some folks will not like it, which is fine. I think it mostly works and, shockingly, many depictions of characters in this likely aren't far from being period-accurate (if I go by my grandfather's accounts from the air force of the time). There is a moment at the end of the film that does feel unnecessary, narratively speaking. However, if that's the sort of thing that riles you up and makes you stamp your feet, you've got bigger problems than an opinion on imdb has any hope of fixing. It's fine. Get over it.I think the film's biggest failing is that it's a popcorn flick that A, wasn't marketed as such, and B, doesn't set itself up as such. When it does jump the shark, it doesn't do so with a knowing nod or any hint of self-awareness. This leaves the viewer torn between questioning the film's intentions - is it taking itself seriously? Am I supposed to take this seriously? - or simply enjoying a fun ride.",Shadow in the Cloud

503,tommylangzik,Extremely Boring & Underwhelming.,3,27 October 2021,"I'll preface this review with a confession: I expected a TOTALLY different movie than the one I got, primarily because the trailer didn't reflect the pace and spirit of actual movie. In other words, the trailer wasn't true to form; it was false advertising. My best guess (honestly) is that the creators KNEW they made a garbage movie, and wanted to trick people into watching it so they could make whatever $$ they could from it.My rating (of 3/10) is based on the fact that the graphics were decent, and the atmosphere was neat. To be honest, this COULD have been an okay movie, but the false misleading marketing coupled with the fact that this movie mostly centered around social justice content ruined it completely.Now, I don't want to come off wrong here... IF I KNOW I'm about to watch a slow-paced movie vs an action movie, I'd adjust my expectations, and take it in stride accordingly. Similarly, if I KNOW I'm about to watch a super liberal virtue-signalling movie, I'll adjust accordingly. In THIS case though, I came in thinking that I'd be watching an action war movie, when INSTEAD I got a preachy feminism movie shot almost entirely within the confines of a gun turret, which made it feel like the whole thing was forcefully being shoved down my throat for an hour.Having said all that, I forced myself to sit through the whole movie, and secretly hoped it would get better... but it never did. MAYBE it could've been saved and gotten a 6/10 if the lead character were less whiney and annoying, but even under those conditions, it would be a VERY generous rating bump.Honest conclusion, if you're a guy looking to watch a war movie, do yourself a solid and skip this film; I PROMISE you're not missing anything.

Absolutely no dull moment or loss of tempo. Very good and believable acting especially from Chloë who because of her good looks has s kind of set-back when it comes to this perhaps. I think she convinces major and never disappoints throughout. This is also valid for the other players but Chloë clearly carries this movie.I usually don't like horror particularly but the level in this picture is very acceptable though the ""monster"" could have been a a little bit more hidden until nearing the finale. And although much is to fantastic to be real, you keep watching wanting to know how it ends. Major reason for this I think is the acting, the care for props, decor, special effects.

Because even I could stand the heavy handed, over done ""all men are misogynistic pigs"" *cries in toxic masculinity*
Get off the high horse and make a movie for the love of all things good in the world.The entire 86 minutes feels like peeling your fingernails off in strips. I've never wanted a main character to die so bad, and these reviews praising our lead for her role? Brothers and sisters, she was the ONLY one on screen for 84 of those minutes, which is probably why the movie was so unbelievably unbearable. From every underpaid haunted house operator type screams and her heavy breathing that had me concerned about her lung health and looking for my albuterol. We kill of all the people without color who are just ""pigs"" and keep our inclusion card, knight in shining armor and the boy who cried ""Darla"".Can we also talk about the unbelievable odds this chik faces? Scaling the bottom of a plane moving at hundred of miles an hour getting back in the plane, not getting shot and sticking tbe landing. All the while her curls keeping that perfect bouncy and other than a slight flush to the cheek and minor scrapes anywhere but the money maker she's totally fine... and the baby? Idk but that kids built different, shaken baby syndrome, high altitudes, freezing air, gun fire a crash landing and monsters trying to steal it for some unknown reason? Everyone in this movie should have been dead.Maybe it would have been better if the Japanese had won the war because at least we could have avoided this cinematic dumpster fire. Just another female creator taking a shallow stab at ""horror"" if you can call it that with just enough action to get it cross categorized so they can hard flex their political agenda.... free the nip I guess.Oh....and that's not how explosions work.",Shadow in the Cloud

526,devonotaylor,Very Ambitious But...,5,9 April 2021,"In the first section it was interesting. This aircraft woman, gets on a plane urgently demanding to carry out a last minute top priority mission. She is face with very misogynic men, like extreme levels of misogyny that would make case of being concern of her well-being.As expected she is treated with a bit hostility and skepticism, because she a ""dame"", and they don't know her and this is a US aircraft. So they put her in the underfloor, in the turret, which has great sky visuals and she see's alot of unexpected things.There is alot tension and mystery building into who she is, whats in the bag, and the guys already don't respect her in any capacity. They kinda respect her ""Top Mission"", documents however. So when she fights a gremlin and has to lie about it, they want to interrogate her. And she override their control of the underfloor and that decision.After enemy jets appears, all this action takes place and its really ambitious but, she is doing captain marvel level stuff in this film and I'm suppose to believe she's just a fight jetter? Yeah, not very realistic, but then again no action is so...This movie is, well what movies suppose to be in a sense. Not really realistic and plenty of exaggerated realities.

I am sorry if a film lacks any and all drive to push for a new level of excitement! But spending the majority of a film in one single location, with poor dialog, poor acting, and the most mind numbing drawn out rubbish where all a sudden you have an attacking plane, a gremlin, a baby, and pointless backstory, weird as hell cut away scenes to other characters in a red light with a black background, and I haven't even gotten to some the worse qualities of this film.

This film is about a woman that has multiple different challenges to deal with all at the same time. As in all horror, the gremlin is a metaphor. Also, contrary to other reviewers, I don't think the gremlin was an unneccesary element. The film educates us about the role of women in WW2. For instance, did you know women flew dangerous reconaissance missions in unarmed planes? And no one can disagree with me that the pacing in this movie is amazing. It goes from thrill to thrill and manages to surprise us many times over. The movie is very well directed and CGM gives a standout performance. All the time she is in the sperry the camera is on her and the other crew can only be heard on the radio. The clausteophic atmosphere filmically communicates the contrast between her and the male crew.

This is not that kind of movie.

That's how it felt to me...others may describe it differently...The acting and tone of the movie are spot on for the era...maybe that's why some people have complained...it was a ""man's world"" in the air during the war...so how they responded to ""her"" presence, was accurate.
I wasn't expecting Jurassic Park level CGI...but what was done, was applaudable. Considering the trailer, I have to say overall, I enjoyed this movie...it did not disappoint...even the Looney Tunes blowback scene that was in the trailer...when watched in the context of the full scene, it makes perfect...ridiculous, and funny sense.Don't take this movie for anything but what it is...a war movie that doesn't bore you with history, or politics...it's one moment...one sitiation...and you getting to see how the craziness unfolds.For what it is...it worked for me perfectly",Shadow in the Cloud

Reviewing this because the rating of 4.7 when I'm writing this, does not reflect this superb film.This is a strong woman lead action film with a plane gremlin. (This is not a spolier, it's there in the first scene)
A rollercoaster ride, with a very simple story (which I don't want to spoil), not overly original, but original in this particular setting.Excellently executed. Tension is built until it erupts in a climax of very enjoyable action topped with a staple shmaltz message at the end.
Everything about the ratios of the ""portions"" in this film, work extremely well.I read reviews here complaining about the laws of physics. Did I mention that it had a plane gremlin in it? Physics is of no concern here.I would venture all the bad ratings are from weak a$$h01e males who throw a tantrum whenever a strong female lead shows up, like the chauvinist stereotypical fly boys in the movie.Is it realistic? Hell no!
Is it perfect? Of course not!
Is it fun? Hell yeah!
Is the suspense good? Yes!
If the situation plausible? No! (Did I mention there is a plane gremlin?)I rarely enjoy horror elemnts in film, but here it's what releases the film from needing to be overly realistic. It releases it from ""responsibility"". And because it's executed so well, it is a necessary part of what makes the film excellent.I enjoyed every single moment of it, and I'm guessing if you ever liked closed quarters action films, strong women leads, decent action scenes, and a badass hero that defeats evil against all odds, I would bet you would as wellIf you identiy too much with the male sh1#heads on the plane, then probably not.",Shadow in the Cloud

The listed writer Max Landis sounds like a self-obsessed, narcissist, abusive creep, and thankfully the director and star (I believe both of them) reworked the script over so any contributions of his are nil.Any criticisms about it being unrealistic are pointless criticisms, because the film is not intended to be realistic.

The acting and directing was questionable, the film ignore common sense, simple physics and reality. The strongest character and best acting comes from the CGI gremlin. I was left at the end scratching my head ... why was there a baby in a box and why was that a thing, how did a 5ft nothing girl kill a gremlin with her bare hands when that thing was capable of ripping metal apart and lastly why did the director feel the need to have her whip her breast out as the end scene to breast feed the baby, haven't got a problem with this in movies but it had nothing to do with the movie/plot/ what was going on at all other than to be a bit progressive, I mean seriously I've just been in a plane crash, killed a big ass gremlin everyone's injured and covered in blood ... hold on bet that kid wants a meal ....

I went in with almost no expectations, and left feeling more disappointment than anything else.Things really started to fall apart for me during an extended radio sequence, where the film goes out of its way to be as crass as possible for no reason. It's like a group of 12 year-olds got together to express their thoughts on how hard they would each bang the main character. This one scene represents about 80% of the crew's involvement in the story, and all it really does is make sure you don't care if/when any of them get picked off later.And what's really frustrating about it is that most of the crew's dialogue is just voiceover, so they could have re-worked this so easily at any point during post. The rest of the movie is a totally serviceable bottle story that's stupid, but fun. With a few minimal changes, this could have been an enjoyable little PG-13 genre movie with much wider appeal.

It's a movie about a woman fighting gremlins on an airplane. That should be all you need to know to set your expectations.

This movie continuously jumps the shark and has multiple unrealistic moments. But the production on this is so good, I can let that all slide. It's a popcorn flick.

The moment the main character gets blown *into* a B17 fuselage via the hole where the ball turret used to be, after she had been climbing around the belly/wing while it's in flight, isn't the most laughable part... Why would you use your finger as a deadbolt to keep a hatch shut?? Who arranged the eclectic crew??

A secret agent boards a B17 bomber with orders to deliver its secret cargo while flying through enemy territory in the Pacific.But the actual premise is a call to a classic Twilight Zone episode in which a monster (seen only by the protagonist) tears apart an airplane piece by piece while the crew is blissfully oblivious of its existence.All that is good enough and makes for an interesting first half of the movie. With most of the time spent watching Chloe Grace Moretz stuck in a ball turret hanging from the belly of the aircraft, bantering with the crew.In the second half of the movie however, everything falls apart. There is no more intrigue or tension. The movie becomes a strange mix of horror, thriller, war action, and family drama (yes, yes!).

612,octavedoctor-1,"A recycled concept, but that's OK...",7,9 August 2021,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this movie has a definite 80s b-movie vibe, and I believe there is a reason for this.I remember reading an interview with Dan O'Bannon in which he pointed out that Alien was a development of the motif used in John Carpenter's ""Dark Star"", in which an alien gets loose on a spaceship and causes havoc. In Alien the motif was played for its horror effect, as opposed to comic value in Dark Star.However the alien havoc motif in Dark Star was, in itself, inspired by a script by - I think - John Landis (I'm not 100% sure of this, it might have been O'Bannon himself, or even Richard Matheson), about a gremlin that gets loose on a wartime B-17, inspired by the Private Snafu cartoon shown at the start of the film. Having passed through various hands - as properties often do in Hollywood - This was subsequently reworked as ""Nightmare at 20,000ft"" which was an original episode of The Twilight Zone, subsequently remade as a segment of the portmanteau Twilight Zone: the Movie.Twilight Zone: The Movie was produced by John Landis, and who should appear as a co-writer of Shadow in the Cloud but Max Landis, son of John.So, I believe that this movie is based on the original treatment that gave rise to at least three classic movies, and perhaps should be seen in that light.Undeniably, the movie has flaws but, honestly, it's no worse than any other 80's horror. Chloê's English accent is well rendered, although I find it implausible that an American girl of the 1940s could have pulled off quite such a convincing performance. After all, Chloê's a professional actress with access to voice coaches and considerably more exposure to authentic British accents than Garrett/Mrs Johnson would have had growing up in the first half of 20th century America.Was the ending implausible? Yup. Ridiculous, even, but, seriously, when has that been an issue in the movies? Mission Impossible, anyone? Fast and Furious 1 through 8? Stranger Things? Gravity?

Mind you, even though I'm a white male myself I did not feel ""politically singled out"" as a lot of these reviews claim, I know I'm not like that and that settles it for me.
What I did feel, however, was ashamed of that behavior knowing it might've been correctly depicted for that time period.
History has shown women were treated as worthless, especially in ""elite male only""-professions, so its doubtful it was all made up.
(Although I sure hope it was exaggerated by a lot)At least the characters kind of hero'ed up and the 2nd part of the movie was entertaining. So all you leaving reviews, you probably didn't even get there and are basing this on the first part.Basically the movie is pretty good, entertaining and suspenseful.

Overall the Movie has a good script and Potential, but seriously a Gremlin in WWII?, I mean they can show us some other Time-Period, In which the Gremlin may have been believable. Some Other Locations like an Island would have been more believable.Background Score:
Well Actually, This film does not have a huge amount of background scores and only In some epic you'll be able to hear it, but actually it's Damn Good.Visual Effects:
I have some mixed opinion on Visual Effects. They Actually look like the ones used in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets for Dobby.
However The Plane and Flying Sequences have some great Visual Effects, but the Gremlin looks more like a 2000s film. Realising the budget of the film we can ignore that stuff.Cinematography:
Well Actually This Film is Superb in this Category. Great Cinematography... No Words.Set and Production Design:
What Can I Say? Awesome and Great!Makeup, Hairstyling and Costume Design:
The Makeup and Costume Designe are Top Notch, but slightly disappointed in the Hairstyling Department, I Mean The Hairstyling is Good but it doesn't feel like the 1940s Theme.Physics:
They Have Killed Physics in this Movie, No Sense In The Scenes, Like The Rescuing Baby Sequence or Coming Back With A Blast, Seriously? I'm Really Disappointed at this part.Overall, It's An Enjoyable Movie, but not a must watch. it's upto you",Shadow in the Cloud

It's obviously not meant to be realistic and it doesn't have to be.. it's a movie. I thought Chloë's acting was great, and yes the story is kinda odd but I liked it. It's a nice action/thriller about a mother doing whatever it takes to protect her child and I'd love to see more movies like it.I made an account just to review this movie. I was surprised by it's rating, it deserves better.",Shadow in the Cloud
656,clarahumpfred,The missing link,1,27 January 2021,"This film does about nothing, you start with a stormy night, with Chloe running onto the runway for a plane, the guy on the run way disappears but for no reason, then the plan narrowly misses Chloe character, and as if by magic does a sharp u-turn to pull up just behind our character still stood on the run way. Then once onboard you have the very pointless confrontation. Okay I get it the orders were fake but surely when given the orders you would just accept, so we have a prolonged scene in which nothing happens but pointless arguing... Then Chloe's character is sent into the turret under the plane, this will then take roughly the next 40 minutes of nothing happening but some weird gremlin on the wing a couple of fighter planes attack... Super boring... all the while this is happening we have more pointless dialog with the crew which continues painfully... Then we have more crew characters being **** to our character pointlessly... Then we have the ridiculous under the plane scene which was more annoying than fun, it wasn't even laughable... Then we learn that the secret mission was a baby... Then we have another plane attack... Then more gremlin stuff... Then back in the plane for more fighter attacks... More gremlin stuff... more baby stuff... Plane blows up under ours shooting Chloe's character somehow back into the plane... Then more pointless stuff happens... Then the film just kinda ends, theres not really much to this film, you have three separate stories each one never getting the chance to be something more, we have super annoying boring scenes where it is just someone in a turret... it just honestly felt like more effort than fun, if you are someone that actually enjoyed this film, I would take my hat off to you but I just couldn't I felt as though my very soul just wanted to quite! Then I guess what is more annoying is anyone that sticks up for the film when Max Landis was the original writer and well just look up his situation right now, its great to see those that want to support Max by saying this was a good film!",Shadow in the Cloud

It was trying way too hard to be a serious movie. Maybe if they went for campy thriller. But this is just bad thriller.This is 90 minutes of Chloe grace moretz doing accents with a war on in the background. Oh yeah, there's a gremlin that tears apart the place throughout and yet no one does anything about it except to make crude joke about the protagonist.You KNOW that baby died from SIDS in the first 10 minutes.I watched it so you don't have to.

663,daveluther-16925,It's getting review bombed,8,2 August 2021,"It's just a bandwagon at this point because in no way is this a 1/10. It's like people have forgotten what genres are or something. This is a movie about a gremlin on a plane in WW2, with a couple of twists thrown in. It isn't Shawshank Redemption. It's primary concern is making a bat**** crazy movie. And it absolutely succeeds. The reveal, dialogue, acting and pacing during the turret section was fantastically done and was a worthy homage to the Twilight Zone episode that inspired it. The people checking their watch during that section had already made up their mind to complain about it once the movie was done, the payoff afterwards was that the movie packs all it's crazy into the final section and the results are hysterical. It's intentional, just a whacky film. You're supposed to turn off your critical mind and have fun. Definitely check it out if you don't automatically hate everything and you're totally cool with movie physics. Loved it.",Shadow in the Cloud

The majority of the first half is shot somewhat like a bottle episode and is mainly just Chloe doing really quite a good job of working with what she was given. It has some interesting set up, with some action and horror, that helped keep me watching even when it was just one person on screen. The first half of the movie is why it gets a 5.The second half of the movie is more B movie than I think I've ever seen. I don't want to describe too much in case you want to see the dumbest bits for yourself, but just think of the most unbelievable nonsense you can think of. It's that, but doubled.

671,salgurdar,Not Sure What I Just Watched.,4,8 November 2021,"With solid performances from the cast, a fairly accurate depiction of how a woman would have been treated and considered in that time period and that situation. The only question the movie raises is: was this script originally written without the gremlin and some production executive decided that's what it needed? So many things about the ""horror"" aspect of this movie seem completely disconnected, as if they were tacked on right before this film went into production. I feel as if the movie would have been improved by simply removing any and all instances of the gremlin. The false pretense for Garret's reason to be on board the plane, the out of the blue attacks by Japanese aircraft, Garret's fight to stay alive, all of these element would have sufficed to make a decent plot, it's like the gremlin was solely there to steal the baby to give Garret motivation to be a bad*ss when she didn't really need it. It had little to no other impact on the plane or crew, the engine outages could have been put down to the initial Japanese attack, and it was revealed WAY too early to be a menacing presence. Everything in the film could have been accomplished without it's existence. The gremlin was almost a literal gremlin to this film. Also, the scene where Garret is ""blown"" back into the B17 was totally preposterous. Probably another addition by an executive.",Shadow in the Cloud
672,pethel01,It's always been the same old song...,10,3 January 2021,"Some ( or most?) guys have heavy problems with action movies done by female actors and even more by female directors. Know this since the days of Geena Davis, Charlize Theron and here Mrs. Liang and Mrs. Moritz. Guys this flic is not for you, it is for femals. Which means around 50% of the worlds population. Got it? And yes women feed babys with their breasts. They can do it. Maybe some are angry because they can't... OK, the movie. It is about wartime but not a reality-near masterpiece as ""The Outpost"" (not one woman around, you like it). And it is not a lesson in physical realism. This is comic, bizarre and wild. Reminds me to a very special female joke, a short one: Two hunters meets... Uuups... The set inside the B-17C ist well done. Special the claustrophobia inside the machine gun cabin. That cabins were deathtraps for the gunners. Cloe is acting like hell in this scenes. Also her artistic action is very impressing (forget the physics).She plays a woman with all female emotions to offer in her strongest way: protecting her baby. Hell, get out of my way... Like the cat monster too. It is horror, but not to much. All the action and cgi is well done. For the budget impressive. To have in mind this is not an US production it is from New Zealand. A small country, population is around 3,5M not more. For movie industry less important. Culture is deeply british what gives a special sense. The men in the plot are portrait in a way like women were in old movies from that time the movie plays. Just objects and staffage. This production is other more interesting then the typical streaming offered today, sorry for that.. But for me nowadays streaming is what they called dime novels in the old days.. Read it, watch it and forget it.. cheap in all ways and mostly done in the same concept. To deliver thrills, get the intention of the audience. Not to switch off. This little peace of art i think is more. OK done. One last remark to the trivia. The british RAF in WW2 had female flight staff in combat missions too. Special with the B-17.",Shadow in the Cloud

It's entertainment, plain and simple. You can tell it's a B movie right away just from the title graphics. It's has elements of the Twilight Zone and the gremlin movies. Sure world war II details aren't accurate and the sheer surrealness at the beginning of the movie on the tarmac is a clue that this movie isn't about reality. It was a truly imaginative stunt to fall out of the plane only to be blown back into the plane by the enemy plane exploding right underneath. So, I'd advise viewers of this flick to sit back and enjoy it instead of looking at it with all too critical eyes. It was a surprise at the end to see the main character feed the baby at the end in the manner that she did. I guess I still see her as quite young which she is. Ah well.

Chloe Grace Moretz did a fine job as did the rest of the actors.,Shadow in the Cloud
720,tezraym-65696,What did I watch,2,2 August 2021,"Only reason for watching was Chloe, film was terrible no wonder they added a baby I just wanted to make sure the baby was ok otherwise I really didn't care at all, terrible film that made no sense at all and was pointless making, but she is really fit could fit quite a few up those nostrils haha.",Shadow in the Cloud
721,goeth-benn,Hmmmmm....,3,1 January 2021,"Started great! I liked her trapped in the turret. It was building up nicely.

723,krissra,Sadly laughable.,3,6 January 2021,"Remember the fake trailers in Tropic Thunder about all the Scorcher movies? Shadow in the Cloud is exactly like this, but while the ones in Tropic Thunder are pure parody, I do believe they take themselves pretty seriously with this one. Moretz is acting as much as possible in this schlock, and that's pretty much it. Characters are laughable, script is laughable, the ending is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. I hope this was some contract thing or a passion project, because she really needs to talk with her agent.
Moretz can do so much better.",Shadow in the Cloud

725,garybenade,"Well worth a watch, this is not a feminist man hating movie at all - don't believe the hype",7,4 January 2021,"This movie takes nothing away from the heroes of world war II, in fact it brings home just how harsh and brutal it was to be crew on a flying fortress, I have nothing but respect for the lone airman that manned the belly turret, the isolation and cold and claustrophobia they experienced is made clear in this movie thanks to Chloe's brilliant acting. At no point did I feel that this movie was sexist or made to portray men in a bad light, the dialogue is what you would expect from a combat hardened crew of men unexpectedly dealing with a pretty woman aboard their aircraft. Only the ending credits make a point of showing that women were part of the war effort even if they were not on the front lines and Chloe's character does not make her out to be a macho war hero at all, in fact her back story as an experienced non-combat pilot is very believable. Bottom line, a mother will protect her young, Ripley did it in Aliens and Maude (played by Chloe) does it in this movie. The film is far from perfect but it's a wild ride and well worth a watch, especially if you're a Chloe fan",Shadow in the Cloud

'Shadow' reminded me of the good parts in the Twilight Zone episode with William Shatner as the scared-out-of-his-wits airplane passenger (S5E3, Nightmare At 20,000 Feet), but in full-color with more all-around action, more characters, and a much better ending.

I rarely find movies memorable these days, but this one had a surprise at every corner! Also, Chloë Grace Mortez's performance was superb IMO!

742,nf-75609,Not the acting,1,5 June 2021,The acting isn't the problem with this film. The problem is the story and how ridiculously fictional it is. This shouldn't be labeled as an action/war movie. Bad sci-fi/fantasy is more like it.,Shadow in the Cloud

753,rossjblade,A insightful take on escaping intimate terror,10,8 May 2021,The gremlin proved a brilliant metaphor for the kind of ruthless predatory husband the protagonist sought to save herself and child from. It is a tragic reality that insanely controlling husbands will frequently snatch a child from its mother if not murder them making the terror associated with her flight (escape) and subsequent demand by the male crew (society) that she be returned all too realistic. That in the end she beats the beast to death is aspirational as society does not afford a woman this option.,Shadow in the Cloud

755,dirthaloboy,Very unrealistic. Lead actress did well though.,5,12 May 2021,"Horribly unrealistic. Writers were off in LALA LAND. SPOILER ALERT. There is no possible way for a person to climb around on the outside of a plane while in flight or do the other things that were done. Especially a B17 during war time. Or be blown back into the plane through the ball turrets hole unharmed from another plane exploding after falling out of the ball turret hole.

She was acting her ass out but the quality of the cgi and stuff wasn't doing her any justice. The story didn't really make sense to me, I mean I see what they were trying to go for but I wish they would have added scenes to make more sense of what's happening.

760,leedelg,Chloe Grace carries this movie,7,8 January 2021,This was a good period peace led by Grace. Do not listen to the negative reviews. The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions and is seriously character underdeveloped. But it's good watch. I wish they explained where these creatures came from but the back story was enough for me to actually be cheering on the last 20 minutes. This movie also reminds us of the contributions women had to the wars this country has fought. Give it a go as I was skeptical too but was satisfied barring my early criticisms.,Shadow in the Cloud
761,atmwest,Hah!,3,3 September 2021,Absolutely hilarious completely unintentionally. Clearly a labor of love by the director/co-writer.

763,mattes-84087,Overall Not That Good,4,3 February 2021,"Although this movie got a lot of Praise from critics to be completely honest I did not like it that much. The movie is a hodgepodge of many different storylines and different aspects trying to connect. The movie is surprisingly unrealistic for how much of a serious tone it holds. The whole creature on the plane scenario while a good idea has no explanation it's just there. Not to mention the script is absolutely god awful. The charecters in the movie talk nothing like people do in real life. Half the lines seem to be made to make the lead look like a badass. The acting is generally good but there's a lot of cringeworthy moments. I also have to say the fight scene at the end between the creature and the lead is so stupid. They also never explain why the creature has such a fascination of the baby, since the creature never opened the box to see there was a baby inside. I feel as if the movies multiple storylines had their own individual movie all of them would be much better then this.",Shadow in the Cloud

Well guess what... it's about to happen.This film is pure entertainment and if you go in with that mindset you will love every minute of it.

Reminds me of those single scene movies (in a car, in a telephone booth, or behind a table - I think it was De Niro acting in the last one).The whole movie was pretty ""flat"" with little elevation of tensions and drama. It's not a sci-fi but rather a fantasy, because a lot of unrealistic things happened (if we exclude the thing) such as climbing under the plane like that...The movie tries to drag you in with the tension building up but somehow it didn't drag me. It never reached a point where I couldn't just pause the movie and pour myself a cup of cola.The computer generated scenes were pretty obvious and average at max.

When confronted with the unexplained, disbelief, ridicule, and sabotage are the weapons used to silence those pointing out the ""king has no clothes"".

The nonsense you are shown is disparate for a reason too. It seems like 4 stories, but it's just 1.The goal is to side with Chloe. To see the strife a woman can see in society. As much as this movie is full of nonsense all happening in parallel so is life.Against all odds and all reason Chloe wins. When life throws a curve ball she improvised. She succeeded where everyone else fails.
The husband is seen on the runway. Each character is just some meaningless idiot blip in her life, including the love that rejected her.

It's almost like this was their one shot at making a movie and they fought between 3 different storylines. Then they said, ""Ahh! Chuck it. Let's do it all in one"". Here are the pointers I just couldn't come to terms with:1. Everyone onboard is an idiot. She is the only one who could shoot down the planes, save the baby, spot enemies, punch the gremlin dead. Everyone else was just watching in awe. Yet, she had to run away from her husband cause he used to beat her. Must be a real monster she married.2. A combat airplane is flying and its actually in pieces. Pull a lever and it comes off and then another one. Finally, the entire station just falls off.3. I just didn't understand if she was a combat pilot or not. She sure was familiar with what nots of the plane and then appeared that she was running from her husband and saving her baby, under someone else's ID?4. Crawling under the plane, not sure how she was using her legs.5. That baby was incredible. Not a scratch or tear after surviving the crash, till the time she pick the baby up. Thats what scared him and he started crying. Oh wait. Sorry, he was hungry so she had to feed him without a worry about where they crashed or if there are more gremlins.6. Fighting the gremlin was almost like it knew Martial Arts.7. The gremlin was shot off the plane and after at-least a few 100 kms the plane touched down. Well, guess that Gremlin was a tracker.8. The gremlin knew the parts he had to tamper with, to shut down the engine. Then too the plane was airborne. Everyone just conveniently forgot about the parts that were thrown off the plane.First 20 mins, I was really excited thinking that I finally got a good movie to watch. But then, the writers and director got confused between 3 movies and ended up messing it up.If you want to watch it, watch it like a comedy movie and I can guarantee you laughs.

In those cases the only redeeming part is the fact that it is fun, be it for the spectacle, explosions, action, comedy or just weirdness. Shadow in the Cloud has action, suspense, explosions and some comedic moments, but it sadly does not do the trick.
The movie suffers from too many ideas, not committing to any of those. It begins with Noir-ish theme with mysterious protagonist, dark mist filled set washed with neon green and red light. But then for the majority of the film turns to a one-woman show, where only character on screen is the protagonist locked in a cramped pod, communicating with other characters through a radio (think Ryan Reynolds movie Buried). And at the end it turns to full on action-adventure movie. This jarring shift in styles makes it seem like 3 different directors mushed their ideas into a single film.
The thing that saves this movie from being bad is it's length. At 1 hour 23 minutes it does not overstay it's welcome, but I feel like some scenes could have been even more trimmed down or cut-out altogether (the animated segment at the very beginning of the movie springs to mind).
If you're looking for some fun dumb movie to turn off your brain for I'd say skip it.

950,charlespdallas,Disappointing,3,2 January 2021,"I am normally a massive Chloe Grace Moretz fan, even movies that are considered a miss like 5th Wave. I am also a monster movie fan, whether that is major AAA shows like Godzilla, Cloverfield or pure B movies that are entertaining as long as you don't take them too serious ( Anaconda, Pirana, Lake Placid, older Godzilla movies, etc.Unfortunately this movie was a complete miss across the board. Wasn't a good Chloe Grace Moretz movie, wasn't a good monster movie, nor did it even embrace being a B flick.I do not recommend. Just flat out bad",Shadow in the Cloud
951,dalewag,Don't bother,2,12 January 2021,"I was looking forward to, this movie, but was so disappointed. I can't believe I watched it to the end it was that bad. One of the worse films I've seen in recent years",Shadow in the Cloud

953,nbrown-12735,Hulu should refund my monthly bill,1,23 May 2021,"As the title of this review states... Hulu should be obligated to refund my monthly bill just for watching this dumpster fire. I have watched many garbage movies in my time and I have never felt the need to write a review. This movie is the so called straw that broke the camel back. The movie starts off with what maybe a good plot line, but immediately goes off the deep end with plot holes the size of Texas. It then abruptly ends in probably the dumbest ending to a movie I have ever watched. I almost feel bad for the actors who were cast into the worst writing in cinematic history, but surely they read the script before accepting their roles. What ever. I just hope this saves some other poor soul from wasting their time.",Shadow in the Cloud

959,osceliker,worth 99 cents but not more,4,4 June 2021,Script is horriblr and some of the acting. Supposed to be a horror movie??? More like it is a comedy the way the whole movie was written. Main character walking under the wing while the plane is flying like it is not moving (some wind effect but that's it). Glad I paid no more than 99 cents.......,Shadow in the Cloud
960,billdav-88529,"Quirky, different, but entertained us.",8,27 January 2021,"We went with an open mind, not really knowing what to expect. It held our interest from beginning to end.

961,judgin-44647,It's worth of watching,8,13 September 2021,"Fortunately watched it before looking for reviews!I don't remember when I last time was sitting for the duration of the whole movie and worried for the heroes. The quality of the movie - effects snd alike- is bery good, no glitches or feelings it's cheap, quite serious level. Cannot say I like actors from the beginning, but must admit they played very well, even started respecting Chloe as an actress.Spoilers !!!The plot is interesting, but here is a tricky thing- the plot is incompatible with itself: dead soldiers, war, skirmish- not for young people definitely , but appearance of a gremlin seems like a joke, and it's like something alien to the movie. I can accept it, though it was weird, however it's not surprising themat The movie didn't hit the box office- I wonder, what was the target audience? Too early for children, maybe entertaining for adolescents, and too irritating for adults?",Shadow in the Cloud
962,craig-84937,Great movie in a difficult covid and gender biased time,10,4 January 2021,"I'm a great fan of sci fi, the twilight zone and Stephen King. This movie encapsulates them all while also perfectly fitting of the modern times we live in. Chloe was great in her role, the build up was slow, soundtrack was great and all made during covid restrictions which was obvious and therefore limited character interaction. Sound story, engaging and enough to satisfy my need for science fiction. Probably not a 10/10 in normal times but we don't live in normal times right now. Perhaps critics should take this into account. I loved it along with the hounds of love cover in the end credits",Shadow in the Cloud
963,rikus-56833,One of the best cinematographic movie,10,9 January 2021,I dont understand why it's getting so low rate. This flim should not be below 8. What a superb cinematography and breathtaking scenes. How far a mother could go to safe her child is shown in a great way.. please go and watch the movie..,Shadow in the Cloud
964,jjoh-03176,So Unbelievably Bad that it is Awesome!,7,29 May 2021,"This is another of what I call Covid Era Films. Low budget, bad writing, and actors in films they would never blink at under normal circumstances. However, Shadow in the Cloud took it to another level, because it is sooooo bad that it is actually hilarious and fun to watch. This film will not stimulate your intellect, it is not thought provoking, political or even artsy and it will not win any major awards. So, with that in mind, You read the other reviews and you might pass on this one, but If you think Chloe Grace Moretz is great, and you are curious, then you might actually consider giving it a few minutes of your time. Its a litmus test I do on movies all the time on Netflix, Hulu, whatever. I give a movie a 10 or so minute test drive and see if it is worth my time. I could not turn away from this one because the badness of it continues to escalate to new levels that its actually compelling and has you wondering what stupid crap can possibly happen next.The first 20 minutes of this movie I am thinking 'ok, this movie isn't that bad, and Moretz is actually doing really well'....but then it takes a turn and I am thinking WTF??!! And then (SPOILER ALERT) just when you think its bad, it shifts into overdrive when she is crawling on the underside of a plane in flight like it is flying at 45 mph. With that, it all clicked that the whole premise and ridiculousness of this story is supposed to be campy and stupid, kind of like Snakes on a Plane, but better in a bad movie awesome kind of way. We laughed at the craziness and the way it ended was simply hilarious and awesome. Moretz is fantastic and puts her all into making it as dramatic as possible, but this is covid cult film quality and should be watched with low expectations, a great sense of humor, maybe some alcohol or other stuff, and you will not be that disappointed. You might get a laugh and enjoy it. Damn, it was bad...and great.",Shadow in the Cloud
965,mycatisbarsik,Scary and very funny,7,8 January 2021,"An excellent New Zealand satire on modern Hollywood.
At least I hope it's satire, because by the end of the movie I was already laughing out loud.",Shadow in the Cloud
966,camillebild,Entertaining nonsense,7,5 January 2021,"So... no, that was not the best movie of the year. Yeah, the story was total nonsense.
But frankly, I did not get bored, and I get super easily bored, playing candy crush through any kind of movie, that's saying something.
I read so many ""historical inaccuracies"" complaints, it's just funny : come on guys, (one of) the main plot(s) is that a gremlin attacks a plane... There's no need for historical anything, we got a gremlin with wings that likes kids.
But I agree, there does not seem to be laws of physics in this world, 99% of it is absurd, but again, there's a. gremlin. attacking. a. plane.
The first 40 minutes were a close up in a bubble, and it wasn't boring, Grace Moretz was that great. I definitely did not expect a baby in a box, I thought we'd get some boring flashbacks, with a mad scientist/archeologist, finding a shiny stone protected by a gremlin blah blah blah. And no, we got a baby drugged and straped ""safely"" ; a very broken finger not that painful after 10mn ; a perfectly timed explosion and so much more crazy unbelievable things I forgot because it was fun.
Everything was too much and I liked it. I honestly hope you did too.",Shadow in the Cloud

It is basically a live action cartoon, but not an intelligently made one. The premise was not bad, and could have made a decent film if the makers had made different choices (and done some research on B-17s). Think Memphis Belle meets Alien.

Started off stupid and went to insanely idiotic. The trailer looked like it was going to be bad, but a fun corny bad. I just can't even believe someone green lit this. The plot was the worst part of the film. All the male actors, who we barely saw because we literally stared at her face for 40 minutes, were awful and not even funny like I think they were meant to be.

She's incredible and did not disappoint here!Let me also outline that if your a film fan for the cinematic mastery in trying to stretch the envelope... this is your movie.
