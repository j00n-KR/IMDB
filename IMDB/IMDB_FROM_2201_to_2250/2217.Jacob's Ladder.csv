0,Leofwine_draca,Highly recommended psychological thriller rewards close viewing,8,7 August 2016,"Although a definite case of ""style over substance"", Adrian Lyne's movie is nonetheless powerful and compelling viewing, although overlong and a little slow in parts. Halfway through the movie walks a fine line between being irritating and being profound before finally falling in the latter camp. It charts the turmoil-filled life of Tim Robbins, a postal worker who is plagued by paranoia and hideous nightmares. His descent into madness and despair is a difficult one to watch, thanks to the strong characterisation and good acting on Robbins' part, although the shock-twist ending (which will be familiar to any viewer in this post-SIXTH SENSE world) is both brilliant and infuriating in equal measure.Horror fans seeking some real chills rather than the standard bloody carnage (although there are some brief, horrifying glimpses of that in the Vietnam flashbacks) will no doubt be pleased with the numerous disorientating, highly disturbing visuals that this film has. These mainly take the form of the ""demons"" which Robbins sees forever chasing and trying to kill him; their heads shake in a super-fast motion (like in the HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL remake) thanks to some nifty special effects apparently done there and then on set. These ""demons"" surpass even the ones in the same year's GHOST in terms of weirdness and sheer scariness and are definitely a highlight of the movie.Other scenes to watch out for include a disturbing party scene in which strobe lighting is used to great effect; and the film's major, prolonged sequence in which Robbins is wheeled from a brightly-lit hospital into the very depths of Hell. Great, scary stuff. Something most reviewers fail to mention are also the effective on-the-street locations that this film has, as Robbins spends most of his time with the down-and-outs on the dirty, rubbish-strewn streets of New York. At one point he gets his wallet snatched by a guy dressed as Santa! Burnt-out cars and graffiti populate Robbins' surroundings giving the film a very depressing, downbeat feel.The acting is pretty great all round, with Robbins giving it his all as Jacob in the role that possibly geared him towards movie stardom. The underrated Elizabeth Pena is also great as the sympathetic, charming girlfriend, and Danny Aiello is excellent in his cameo as Louis, a doctor with unconventional methods. Even the presence of a pre-stardom Macaulay Culkin can't negate the quality acting of the rest of the cast. The conspiracy angle of the film is handled nicely, when Robbins meets up with his former war buddies only to find them mysteriously ""silenced"". Varying wildly between intense and sombre moods, the film's conclusion is one which had me in tears, which not many films have the power to do these days. JACOB'S LADDER comes highly recommended, but be prepared to concentrate at all moments and stick with it, as it's by no means an easy film to watch.",Jacob's Ladder
1,SnoopyStyle,Great nightmarish images,7,15 September 2014,New York postal worker Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) has nightmarish hallucinations stemming from his horrific Vietnam War experience. His wife Jezzie (Elizabeth Peña) struggles to help him. He is also haunted by his first marriage to Sarah and his dead son Gabe (Macaulay Culkin). Louis (Danny Aiello) is a chiropractor whose adjustments unleashes a long paranoid demonic nightmare.This is a great movie of a personal nightmare. It's a very good performance of a paranoid character from Tim Robbins. Some of the images are actually quite disturbing. It may be the first time that I noticed the shaking head effects. The long nightmare does meander a little. It's hard to expect hallucinations to drive a straight line to a destination. The final reveal is problematic and pulls the rug from the rest of the movie.,Jacob's Ladder
2,claudio_carvalho,"Anguishing, Intriguing, Original, Unique",9,7 October 2006,"On 06 Oct 1971, in Mekong Delta, Vietnam, the American soldier Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) is wounded by a bayonet during an attack to his platoon. He wakes up in New York subway while going home late night after working overtime in the post office. He is divorced from Sarah (Patricia Kalember), lives with his colleague and lover Jezebel (Elizabeth Peña) is a small apartment in Brooklyn and misses his young son Gabe (Macaulay Culkin), who died in an accident where Jacob feels responsible for. Along the next days, Jacob is chased by demons and finds conspiracy in the army, while having different visions of different moments of his life.Yesterday I saw ""The Jacket"" and I decide to see once more ""Jacob's Ladder"", maybe for the fifth time. This anguishing and intriguing story is one of the most original and unique I have ever seen, and has been plagiarized many times mainly in the foregoing mentioned ""The Jacket"". Tim Robbins gives another top-notch performance in the role of a troubled man resolving his life, due to the feeling of guilty for the loss of his younger son. Bruce Joel Rubin, who also wrote and produced ""Ghost"", ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""My Life"", shows that is very connected with spiritual issues, approaching this theme in his films. The Brazilian title of this movie, ""Alucinações do Passado"" (""Hallucinations From the Past""), wrongly induces the viewer and destroys the dubious sense of the original title: Jacob is the lead character, ""Ladder"" is the name of the experiment his platoon and him had been submitted in Vietnam; but the interpretation of ""Jacob's Ladder"" in the Bible is that this is the only means to reach the total ecstasy, the plenitude, however, we need first supersede the obstacles that we find in our ascension. Further, ""Jacob experienced a vision in which he saw a ladder reaching into heaven with angels going up and down it, a vision that is commonly referred to as Jacob's Ladder"" (from ""Wikipedia""). Another interesting aspect is that all the characters have biblical names. For example, Jezebel is considered the most wicked woman in the entire Bible (the character of Elizabeth Peña was responsible for the separation of Jacob and Sarah and maybe he was blaming her for keeping him far from his family); and Gabriel is the angel that explained signs from God and announced the conception, birth, and mission of Jesus to Mary. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Alucinações do Passado"" (""Hallucinations From the Past"")Note: On 19 May 2009, I saw this movie again, now on DVD.",Jacob's Ladder
3,kosmasp,Climbing up or down,9,3 January 2021,"On the insanity scale this has to be up there - wait does that make sense in the realm of the movie? Of the world our main characters live in? Maybe but also maybe not. It is tough to actually figure out where the movie is going and that is a great thing to watch (unfold). It's not just Tim Robbins but everyone else involved who give amazing performances.Than there are the themes! One of them being PTSD as it is called. But it is not the only one. Also what is happening? By the end you will know ... I mean even then I reckon you could discuss certain things and maybe interpret things differently. But the movie is actually clear! A mighty fine resolution - I can imagine some may feel underwhelmed, especially with th added text to attach some ""reality"" to the whole thing. You could see it as based on a true rumor kind of thing.But if you leave that aside (there is no movie that is without flaws, depending on how you look at them), this is a tense and very suspensful ride! One that you will not regret taking ... which cannot be said about the main characters in here ... more than viewing is almost demanded too!",Jacob's Ladder
4,gavin6942,A Robbins-Culkin Freight Train of Love,8,16 December 2006,"A Vietnam vet (Tim Robbins) goes through life not really knowing what to make of things anymore. His blue collar job, his ex-wife, his deceased son... and the growing visions of demons and his belief the government turned its back on him and his comrades.The box cover called this a ""horror movie for the 90s"", but let me say the horror elements are pretty minor. Other than a demon scene at a dance club and a few stray body parts in a hospital, the ""horror"" is really in the background. What we have is a cross between a war movie and a Lynchian ""what is real?"" film.I've had my share of Vietnam movies, because they're all the same to me. ""Platoon"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"", ""Casualties of War"" and ""Hamburger Hill"" can all be the same film for all I care. Even ""Full Metal Jacket"" to some degree (though luckily the focus is more on boot camp and less on the war). In this movie, the war is everywhere and nowhere... it makes for a backdrop to the actual story. I could have used a different setting, even if it was just a different war (Grenada?), but I guess Vietnam is such a movie cliché that it couldn't be avoided.Now, the David Lynch aspects were very well done. Most of the time you don't know if Robbins is awake, asleep, hallucinating or something else. Many people will be turned off by this. But like ""Next Door"" and unlike most Lynch films, you should know the plot by the end and a second viewing will make a lot more sense to you. Well, maybe not the demon part. But the rest.I have said in other reviews that Tim Robbins is possibly the greatest actor in human history. He is like the white Morgan Freeman. And in this, his son is played by the effeminate Macaulay Culkin, who has grown to be a great actor in his own right (even if it's in movies nobody else ever saw, like ""Saved!"" or ""Party Monster""). I'll watch anything with Robbins and Culkin, so this movie had me at hello.I watched this on VHS and some of the video was a bit grainy. A DVD remastered might fix this and I think would help. A bit of polishing would make this seem even more fantastic. Visually, that's my only complaint -- all the scenery and imagery was quite impressive for what I assume is a lower budget film. The Vietnam scenes could have been from any Vietnam movie, and the fact they'd bother to construct a set for the small part it plays in here, to me shows the devotion of the film-makers.I would have liked to give this film a higher, perhaps perfect, rating... but there were times I felt the film was dragging. After the introduction and build-up, there are many scenes that could have been cut and we would still get the point. Is being confused for an extra twenty minutes a good thing? I have no idea. And there were a few times the film could have ended, but kept going on... oh well.",Jacob's Ladder
5,lee_eisenberg,war screws people up,10,27 September 2017,"It's easy to see Adrian Lyne's ""Jacob's Ladder"" as a simple psychological thriller. But I interpreted it as saying that war screws people up. This isn't just PTSD. The protagonist's harrowing experience in Vietnam is causing him to see all sorts of horrifying things. And there's also the issue of gaslight: the lawyer tells the protagonist ""you weren't in Vietnam"" and the shadowy agents try to muzzle him (despite what we find out at the end).This isn't the scariest movie ever, but it's an intense one. I have no doubt that a number of people lost their grip on sanity after experiences in war (especially one as pointless as the Vietnam War). Tim Robbins achieved one of the high points of his career with this movie, with good support coming from Elizabeth Peña and Danny Aiello, as well as brief appearances by Jason Alexander (George on ""Seinfeld""), Ving Rhames (Marsellus in ""Pulp Fiction""), Macaulay Culkin (right before he got famous in ""Home Alone""), Lewis Black (a comedian who performs in the persona of a man having a nervous breakdown) and S. Epatha Merkerson (a supporting actress in a variety of movies and shows).",Jacob's Ladder
6,jboothmillard,Jacob's Ladder,4,24 October 2010,"Imagine if you will the conclusion of The Sixth Sense and the same theme of Ghost, then you will end up with this entry in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, from director Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction, 9 ½ Weeks). Basically Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) is the New York postal worker who just about survived a wound fighting as an American soldier in Vietnam. He is divorced from ex-wife Sarah (Patricia Kalember), he now lives with his colleague and lover Jezebel 'Jezzie' (Elizabeth Peña) and children in their small Brooklyn apartment. Over time he starts having nasty hallucinations of hideous demons, strange events, and his chiropractor friend Louis (Danny Aiello) saying biblical things about Hell and devils. As well as the flashbacks of Vietnam Jacob is also seeing and seemingly talking to his son Gabe (Macaulay Culkin) who has been dead for some time after being hit by a car. After a near-death experience with his fellow Vietnam buddies, they confess to him that they are having bizarre hallucinations as well, so they wonder if the army did something to them. Soon enough this question is answered when Jacob is approached by Michael Newman (Matt Craven), and he reveals that the army invented a chemical to increase aggression, this was called the ""ladder"". Returning to his home he had with Sarah, Jacob goes through a collection of memories, and sees Gabe on the staircase, taking his hand and going up to a bright light, i.e. heaven. It is revealed that Jacob died from his Vietnam injury, and that all his hallucinations are because he has been dead for some time. Also starring Pruitt Taylor Vince as Paul, Jason Alexander as Geary, Eriq La Salle as Frank and Ving Rhames as George. I didn't realise ""Jacob's Ladder"" was a term to describe the ladder to heaven, if I knew that before it may have given the plot away a little. On the other hand, it may have helped, I didn't understand all the random things happening in amongst a very thin plot, the effects are mildly interesting, I don't quite see why it is must see horror thriller, I suppose it is inventive though. Okay!",Jacob's Ladder
7,ccthemovieman-1,Here's A Film You Could Spend Hours Discussing,8,24 March 2006,"Can you say ""disturbing?"" Well, that adjective surely fits this unusual movie, one I've only viewed once but plan on seeing again sometime this year. It's a strange film and could be taken a number of ways. For instance, it has some twisted theology but yet could also be used as a tool for evangelism. It's a difficult movie to interpret but a commentary/interview extra on DVD does explain some questions one would have after watching this because a lot of people apparently misinterpret this film. It's not family fare, I'll tell you that. The language is brutal and there are some scenes in here that are not for the feint at heart. The lead character, played by Tim Robbins, is a tortured soul and plays that role well. Most of the story is told in flashbacks as a man is dying and is going through the final stages of death, recalling some key moments in his life. Those moments are magnified: the bad being shown worse than what it was and vice/versa. The main message here is ""As long as you are afraid of death, the evil demons will torment you, but when you let go and aren't afraid anymore, you'll find those demons to be angels.""This is the kind of film you could probably write long, long essays on. Suffice to say, it's quite different, can be very offensive, but - if you're willing to take a shot at something different and unpleasant at times - it is definitely worth checking out, and then discussing.",Jacob's Ladder
8,BA_Harrison,"Good, but it's all been done before.",7,11 August 2019,"Postal worker Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) thinks he is losing his grip on reality, suffering from terrifying hallucinations and flashbacks. As he delves into the mystery behind his mental anguish, he unravels a conspiracy concerning his days serving in Vietnam.The way I see it, Jacob's Ladder can be interpreted in one of two ways:A) In his dying moments, soldier Jacob - his brain still affected by the hallucinatory chemical agent unleashed by his own side -conjures up a world where his past collides with a bizarre imaginary future where demons haunt his every move. As he passes away, Jacob finds contentment, reunited in his mind with his dead son Gabe (Macauley Culkin).orB) Jacob is already dead, trapped in a purgatory inhabited by monsters, where he must try and escape his torment, guided by an angel (his chiropractor, played by Danny Aiello).Both explanations are valid, but unfortunately, neither is all that original, the first having already been done in the excellent 1961 French short Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (screened in the United States as an episode of The Twilight Zone), and the latter in cult classic Carnival of Souls (1962).Director Adrian Lyne conducts matters with style, presenting some truly unsettling imagery using a variety of impressive (and oft-imitated) film-making techniques, but his treatment is also rather blunt at times, his film practically spelling out the ending - that Jacob is dead/dying - at several junctures. At 113 minutes, the film is also way too drawn out: as 'Occurrence at...' proved, such a story can be wrapped up in far less time (even Carnival of Souls, at 84 minutes, seemed too long).6/10, plus a bonus point for lovely Elizabeth Peña as Jacob's sexy girlfriend Jezzie, whose presence helped the time pass a little easier.",Jacob's Ladder
9,moonspinner55,A harrowing journey made pointless by a final plot twist,5,22 October 2015,"Tim Robbins excels as an ex-combat soldier who wanders around evil city streets, hounded by death and destruction, flashing back on an incident in early-'70s Vietnam wherein his Army troupe came under the influence of something man-made and horrific. Director Adrian Lyne revels in an austere style that is sleek but not always fashionable; the filmmaker puts pain and paranoia in a visually grandiose cinematic context which can be off-putting, especially when considering some of the twisted, unsettling images he foists at us. Robbins is used to good advantage; he's easy and grounded in his role (under the circumstances), and he's an interesting presence. Unfortunately, ""Jacob's Ladder"" is flamboyantly heavy-handed, a drama-cum-horror movie dragging exasperating loose ends behind it. Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin creates an anguished netherworld of nightmarish suffering--which Lyne hammers away at, sometimes tastelessly--but he betrays the audience in the end with a cold slap that renders the entire film nearly superfluous. ** from ****",Jacob's Ladder
10,dbdumonteil,A ladder to a peak.,10,15 August 2001,"In  a Rolling Stone interview,not only Tim Robbins does not say a word about this great role of his,but he also lets the magazine write ""such moribund projects like ""Jacob's ladder"""".How can he underrate himself like that?Adrian Lyne has not produced masterpieces when he directs ""Jacob"":""Flashdance"",9 1/2,a waste of film,and ""fatal liaison ""which makes up for its triteness by stealing the grand guignol bath tub scene from Henri-George Clouzot's ""les Diaboliques"".And yet,this is a masterpiece.How come?This must be the screenplay: a maze,where nightmares and reality are intimately connected.We think we are back to reality,we are still in a bad dream,and in the long run,we don't know where we stand anymore.Until the very end,which for once will not disappoint you because ,along the plot,there are strange signs,clues that justify the conclusion.But you will not be able to guess it anyway.Some scenes are very important for that matter:during the party,a black girl who plays the fortune-teller with Jacob's lines of the hand;the discussion with the chemist;the discovery ,in the hospital ,that there are absolutely no files concerning Jacob;The unfortunate hero climbing the stairs with his long lost child.Lyne uses threatening settings:the subway of which the doors are locked; a bathroom turned into the antechamber of hell;the lawyer's office. Special effects are used only when necessary and to  good results.The soundtrack is precise and haunting.And the director does not forget emotion:you will shed a tear when you hear Jacob talk about his beloved little boy whose photograph he's found again.Some will say it was influenced by ""carnival of sorts"".Perhaps so,but the latter is botched,a dated B movie,with an amateur side.On the other hand,""Jacob's ladder "" did influence ""The sixth sense"" ,and a lot of the laurels bestowed on Bruce Willis's blockbuster should have been given to Adrian Lyne's movie.It stands as the best fantasy and horror film of the nineties,in my humble opinion.",Jacob's Ladder
11,dbdumonteil,"original, scary, mesmerizing what more can I say?",10,27 September 2003,"For several years, there's a very trendy cinematographic genre. This is the ""psychological fantastic"". This genre is very successful as the movies: ""the sixth sense"" (1999), ""what lies beneath"" (2000) or ""unbreakable"" (2000) showed. All these movies must have been influenced by ""Jacob's ladder"". In this way, you can regard Adrian Lyne's movie as a precursory and innovative movie. Lyne achieved a masterstroke in an absolutely new genre for him. It means that you're very far from the atmosphere of ""9 weeks and a half"" or ""fatal attraction"".""Jacob's ladder"" is based on an outstanding screenplay including numerous weird details that increase the spectator's curiosity. It's precisely with the spectator that Lyne and Bruce Joel Robin, the scriptwriter play with. They take a malicious pleasure in getting the spectator lost in a real maze where seem to border dream and reality. Like Tim Robbins, you look for the clue to the mystery. This clue may be the chemist which Jacob's meeting at the refreshment bar truck. This chemist will lead the plot towards an amazing conclusion.In Adrian Lyne's movie, there's also a part of the fantastic genre that is very well exploited: at first common and normal living conditions but that are little by little overcome by the unreal, the strange and the fear.The movie also enjoys an outstanding performance to begin with Tim Robbins. A brilliant success and a movie that deserves to rank among the ten best fantastic movies of the nineties",Jacob's Ladder
12,Quinoa1984,"has problems, but there's a fascination to it that doesn't decrease",7,9 April 2008,"Jacob's Ladder is a frustrating movie. You want to love it, especially if you like Tim Robbins (one of the greats of his generation, when used right anyway) or just pure surrealist works. Bruce Joel Rubin's screenplay attempts to connect two kinds of films: the David Lynch-era surrealist work, and the Coming-home-from-Vietnam flick. But he needs either more ambiguity, or less clutter in the construction of the script. Certainly his dialog also needed work, but to say specifically where would be tricky. Sometimes he makes some scenes sound truthful for what they're worth (i.e. Jacob with his 'woman on the side'), and then others just feel hollow. But perhaps the chief problem is that one invests a lot in this character- thanks to Robbins he is somewhat likable- and it's all for not, basically, when it's revealed what the entire film has been.But despite the flaws in the script (for another thing, even at two hours it feels too long), surprisingly Adrian Lyne makes it work, at least partially as a story and more-so as a visionary. The direction here is some of his best yet, and it goes a ways to try and make up for the flimsier context. You want to keep watching this, especially after the throat-grabbing 8-minute opening in Vietnam, which is a total freak-out sequence. He also goes a ways with his collaborators (DP, editor, sound, the works) to make this what the writer had intended: a disorientating experience where scenes flow as if in stream-of-consciousness, and where life and death hangs on the balance when least expected. At the least, it's a well-conceived and executed work of paranoid film-making.So I guess, perhaps, the disappointment is in the expectations. From what I heard this was supposed to be a true masterpiece of the surreal and strange, and a unique post-Vietnam war movie. But perhaps considering Rubin wrote the script in the 70s, it should have been made then, with a stronger rewrite. There's a really terrific movie somewhere here, but it's just hard to find.",Jacob's Ladder
13,sunwarrior13,A Clever Film,10,30 September 2012,"Vietnam veteran Jacob Singer thinks he is going insane. Or worse. When his nightmares begin spilling into his waking hours, Jacob believes he is experiencing the aftereffects of a powerful drug tested on him during Vietnam. Or perhaps his post traumatic stress disorder is worse than most. Whatever is happening to him, it is not good. That is the premise of this psychological thriller/psychological horror film entitled,Jacob's Ladder., based on a screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin. It stars Tim Robbins,Elizabeth Peña and Danny Aiello; and it was directed by Adrian Lyne.Jacob Singer is a soldier stationed in Vietnam who undergoes a traumatic experience on the battlefield - the nature of which is initially unclear.Obviously,he is a tortured man finds himself caught in a middle- ground between hallucination and reality.The film then moves into his post-Vietnam experience in 1970's New York, where he feels consistently traumatized, but can never quite remember exactly what happened to him in Southeast Asia or to free himself from his anxieties over the recent tragic death of his young son. Though well educated, Jacob works as a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service and has become romantically involved with one of his co-workers, Jezzie, after divorcing his wife. Soon, Jacob's tenuous hold on reality starts to slip as horrifying events befall him; he is nearly run over by a subway train, pursued by faceless demons in cars, and spots reptilian tails and horns protruding from the bodies of those he encounters. He also suffers severe panic attacks related to the chaos that may be reality, or may exist only in his mind. He seeks counsel from Louis, a kindly chiropractor, as his ex- wife Sarah, fellow Vietnam vet Paul, and enigmatic stranger Michael all try to help the tortured soul.Truly frightening and visually unique, this messy, challenging film is anchored by Tim Robbins' remarkable performance.This is simply terrific, original and truly unsettling.It sparks the viewer's interest and maintains high production values, but this confusing film chokes on its ending.But nevertheless,it is one of the most clever films ever released in the 90's.",Jacob's Ladder
14,Theo Robertson,"Not A Worthless Movie , But ...",7,14 September 2004,"... Would it be so well regarded if it wasn't so bizarre ?I first saw JACOB'S LADDER in the mid 1990s . It's a film very similar to THE VILLAGE in that it split the critics right down the middle as to its ending . Upon seeing it for the first time I thought it was rather weird and while not exactly cheating didn't seem all that different to "" He woke up and it was all a dream "" type endingI've seen the movie a couple of times since which is something of a back handed compliment , after all if you know what the ending is JACOB'S LADDER still has some worth . Can you say the same about THE VILLAGE ?I can totally understand why the screenplay had a problem being produced . Imagine you're head of a studio and this script arrives on your desk . How are you going to market it ? It starts off as a war movie , then becomes a supernatural thriller , then conspiracy theory thriller then comes the shock ending revelation which in those days was almost unheard of . The producer and director have probably done the best job possible in making it appeal to a thinking audience but the majority of people aren't a thinking audience and you can just imagine on its original cinema release many female viewers watching the first five minutes thinking there's no way they're sitting through a war movie and walking out , with many of the opposite sex following them after twenty minutes thinking they're going to be watching a domestic drama while after forty minutes the remaining audience are thinking to themselves where the hell this movie is heading I do confess to enjoying JACOB'S LADDER but only in some parts . The party scene is a classic sequence but there's a bit too many slow bits like Jacob's and Jezebel's domestic home life . I guess since Tim Robbins is a fairly well known actor ( And he plays nice guys like Jacob Singer very well ) these days and shock twist endings are in vogue again , not to mention conspiracy theories JACOB'S LADDER will probably be better regarded in 2004 than what it was in 1990 .

15,Hey_Sweden,Interesting stuff.,7,23 November 2013,"From director Adrian Lyne (""Fatal Attraction"") and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin (""Ghost"") comes this provocative drama with touches of horror. It combines elements of psychological thriller, hallucinatory spook show, and conspiracy story to make for entertaining viewing. It alternates between separate scenarios often enough in order to have its audience questioning what constitutes reality and what doesn't. However, if one is aware of the primary literary influence, it may remove just about all of the suspense for them.Still, getting to that conclusion is reasonably fun. It helps that the performances are so sincere. Tim Robbins stars as Jacob Singer, a Vietnam veteran now living a regular life as a postman in NYC. He begins to be plagued by disconcerting visions, and comes to believe that something sinister is going on, getting together with his comrades from 'Nam and even hiring a lawyer (Jason Alexander). At times he lives with a girlfriend, Jezzie, played by sexy Elizabeth Pena, at others he's involved with a different woman, Sarah (Patricia Kalember) with whom he's had three children.There's a plethora of unnerving imagery to be seen in a film that is often experienced rather than just watched. Director Lyne keeps things always somewhat off kilter and nightmarish. Rubins' story is compelling in the way that it juggles its elements and keeps its viewers on their toes. The cast is excellent all the way down the line; it's cool to see people like Alexander and Ving Rhames before their breakthrough roles. Danny Aiello is great as Jacobs' chiropractor and good friend Louis. Matt Craven has one fine scene as the provider of the key exposition. Also co-starring are Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle, Brian Tarantina, and S. Epatha Merkerson. Macaulay Culkin appears uncredited in a small but important role. The music by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by Jeffrey L. Kimball are two very worthy assets.This is a good film that people may want to discover or revisit.Seven out of 10.",Jacob's Ladder

Love it or hate it or somewhere in-between it is unforgettable.One of the best of the psychological Horror films with political overtones and a nod to the needless suffering that was the Vietnam War. It is a creepy and haunting display of spiritual significance, blind patriotism, unwitting experimental subjects, and the need for detachment from body to soul.It is a magnificent attempt at a multitude of human foibles and is couched in a religious allegory that is neither accepting or denying. The imagery is forever fascinatingly fierce in its sharp unsettling unfolding of the mind body connection and the struggle to let go. It is a disturbing descent into the madness and mayhem of chemical inducement and governmental indifference and denial of complicity.A flawless film that is a singular study of the post traumatic fog of war and the near death experience. A unique and artistic array of style and substance with a great cast and even greater Directorial delivery of a multi-layered, thinking man's Horror Film that bends and shapes the fictional with the factional in an unnerving, and deserving piece of timeless angst and Angelic entanglement.",Jacob's Ladder
17,poolandrews,"""I was just a hippie chemist, what did I know?"" Splendid psychological horror.",7,11 May 2007,"Jacob's Ladder is set in New York where postman Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) lives in a small apartment with his girlfriend Jezebel (Elizabeth Pena), however Jacob begins to have visions, dream & hallucinations & suffers from paranoia as he becomes more & more mentally unbalanced. The lines between fantasy & reality become ever more blurred, then he is contacted by an ex army mate Paul (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who confides in him that he too is experiencing the same symptom's & that he is going to hell. Shortly after Paul is killed when his car blows up, Jacob thinks it might be an army conspiracy & that they were 'given' something during their time in Vietnam. Can Jacob discover the truth before he completely loses his mind?Directed Adian Lyne this is an usual psychological horror thriller which forces you to think about it & the themes & issues it raises & isn't that straight forward. The script by Bruce Joel Rubin which takes itself extremely seriously is a pretty complex piece of work, it initially comes across as a detailed character study of Jacob but then throws in lots of conspiracy theory's, strange dialogue & a simple yet effective ending where you'll have to rearrange things in your head & come to a conclusion that suits your own interpretation of events. Jacob's Ladder is a well written film for sure with good central character's you care for & draw you into the story, it has some memorable dialogue, it has numerous twists & turns, it manages to blur the boundaries between fantasy & reality within the film so your never quite sure what your watching or in what context your watching it. As a whole I thought the story was very engaging & it hooked me, I think most people will want to see how this turns out & will want to follow it right through to the end. On the negative side I don't think I'd want to see it again anytime soon, it's perhaps a touch too long at almost 2 hours although having said that I'm not sure what I'd want to see less of.Director Lyne does a good job of portraying a gritty harsh New York, the film has a few creepy moments & some off beat imagery including Jezebel appearing to be raped by some tentacled creature! There's plenty of religious symbolism too with constant references to heaven & hell, overall I'd say Jacob's Ladder has an unsettling atmosphere to it. There's a touch of gore including some gory Vietnam footage & severed limbs but this is all about the story. There are a number of deleted scenes from Jacob's Ladder floating around & having seen some of them they're worth tracking down although I'm not sure I'd put them back in the film especially Jacob's final confrontation with Jezebel.With a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 all I can say is where did all the money go? Seriously that just sounds like a huge amount of money for what ended up on screen, it's well made for sure but there's no big 'name' actors in it, no big special effects scenes & not that many locations either. The acting is uniformly excellent especially from Robbins who makes this film what it is.Jacob's Ladder isn't for everyone that's for sure but if you like challenging films that make you think then you could do a lot worse than this & it's just that bit different. A dark psychological horror thriller that's well worth a watch.",Jacob's Ladder
18,Boba_Fett1138,"Drama, horror, mystery...it all works!",9,11 July 2012,"Combining horror with some serious drama is often a combination that simply doesn't work out all too well. It's extremely hard to do and to find and right balance but I think that this movie succeeded in this, by throwing in some good mystery that will leave you guessing and keep you watching, right till the very end.I think the key to liking this movie is by knowing absolutely nothing about it, beforehand. Just let the story and all of its developments surprise you. The movie keeps throwing you around. The one moment it seems as if its going to be a horror, the other as if its going to be a drama and the other moment it's being a mystery-thriller, with also at times either supernatural elements in it and not. So basically the one moment the movie is being a realistic one, while the other its clearly being more than that. There is a lot going on but the movie never becomes a confusing one.In all truth, this seems to be a movie that is being more common and similar to some of the genre movies that are made this present day. In that regard this movie seemed to be ahead of its time but it also has as a result that today's audience will probably see some of the twists coming from miles away already. About halfway through it already came apparent for me how the movie was going to end and without spoiling it, all I can say is that I wasn't wrong about it.But having said that, that really doesn't mean that the movie won't keep surprising you with its moments and story developments. Even when you already figure out the ending way before the movie ends, you'll still have a more than great time watching this movie and it won't ruin the experience for you in any way.I said before that this movie is quite similar to modern genre movies and this is true for its story but with its style and approach this movie perhaps feels more like a late '60's/'70's psychological horror movie, such as for instance ""Rosemary's Baby"" and to some extend also ""The Exorcist"".It's quite funny. Tim Robbins of course has played plenty of leading roles but I don't remember him carrying a movie as much on his own as he did in this one. He truly is the one character this movie evolves around and I actually believe that he is in every single scene of this movie. He of course does a great job with it and the movie has a great supporting cast as well, with plenty of people in it that at the time were still pretty much big unknown ones but later became well known names, such as Eriq La Salle, Ving Rhames, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Jason Alexander and Matt Craven.An especially at the time quite unique and definitely original movie, that successfully combines drama, horror and mystery!9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Jacob's Ladder
19,view_and_review,Dark and Trippy,7,23 March 2020,"Jacob's Ladder is a biblical item. It is a ladder leading to heaven that was featured in a dream Jacob had. ""Jacob's Ladder"" the movie is kind of a double entendre: it hints strongly towards the biblical Jacob's Ladder while also more directly referring to the drug called ""Ladder.""Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) was a Vietnam vet that was having wicked visions. He was seeing demons and other nasty things. He thought for sure it was indicative of his own perdition until he found out that just maybe the Army was responsible.It turns out that the Army was responsible. They had given his entire platoon a mind altering drug called Ladder that was supposed to make them super-aggressive and more apt to kill. It did just that, but they wound up killing each other instead of the enemy.This movie was trippy and more than a little confusing. It was very difficult to discern what exactly was going on: was Jacob with his girlfriend Jezzie (Elizabeth Pena), was he with his wife and family, or was he dead. At times you think he is in the afterlife and at times you think he's going through a mental trip. The movie is very dark and foreboding and another example of the evils of war.",Jacob's Ladder

Absolutely chilling visceral psychological thriller fully realized by director Adrian Lyne about Jacob Singer (superb, modulated perf by Robbins), a Vietnam vet living a hellish nightmare of flashbacks, demons among us and the otherworldly horrors that beckon to him. Very intense, scary and unsettling depiction of one man's fight to remain sane.

21,evanston_dad,Sound and Fury,6,8 July 2019,"""Jacob's Ladder"" is like a David Lynch movie without the guts to just be a David Lynch movie.Adrian Lyne has done a good job convincing people that he's a bolder director than he is thanks to the shock value in movies like this one and ""Fatal Attraction."" But at heart he's really a fairly pedestrian director, and ""Jacob's Ladder"" suffers for it. The film teases us with the possibility that it might go completely off its rocker, but the ending, though probably quite a plot twist at the time before there was an entire industry of plot twist movies, ties everything up with a disappointingly literal and dull bow. The movie has so many fits and starts, going back and forth in time, blurring the lines between reality and fiction, that it never really gets going. And Lyne and Co. mistake loud and gross for compelling and atmospheric; the film plays like one prolonged hysterical note of randomness. Crazy things just happen, but they happen so often and so relentlessly that we stop caring about why they're happening, and indeed even stop thinking they're that crazy within the world of the film. Roger Ebert, in his review of the film ""Labyrinth"" (which he didn't like by the way), said that if everything is arbitrary, then nothing matters. That's how I felt about ""Jacob's Ladder.""The ending felt like a cheap trick rather than one grown organically from within the movie that preceded it.Grade: B-",Jacob's Ladder

It was, however, a rather disturbing movie about a Vietnam veteran whose rather mundane life is going to pieces by strange visions. He is also being stalked by what are seemingly demons. Through the movie you watch as this character tries to find answers to why he is being stalked by these creatures and by visions of his deceased son. He tries to read up on demons, all the time going through strange episodes, at one point trapped in a hospital where they want to do some rather strange experiments on him. He seems to be getting somewhere when a fellow veteran lays out a story for him. That is about all I can say without giving to much away, it is though a rather interesting movie and I really had know idea where it was going, though the ending did make sense and you will probably go ""that makes sense"". The images are disturbing and for the most part it is a good movie. I could have used more horror and less thriller, but that is me...I am more of a horror fan as one could probably tell from my reviews.

I did remember that it was a good movie, but for the reason it was so. So I decided to watch it again. Now, with a solid background of movies, I finally managed to do it.It is interesting as a film, because it really keeps you on your toes, wondering on what is going on and why. I know it annoyed the hell out of me when I was young, but now I kinda guessed what the story was. Also, this is the only movie that made me browse through three pages of user comments to see what other people had to say about it. I even read the Wikipedia on Jacob's Ladder.Apparently, there is a guy Jacob in the Bible that dreams of a ladder to Heaven, used by angels to move back and forth. In the end, before you are revealed the truth (**going to spoil it now!**), the dead son of Jacob's is taking him ""home"" on a ladder by holding his hand. Of course, in the end the guy is dead. He never left Vietnam, the whole thing was a vivid dream state experience induced by experimental army drugs and low brain oxygenation, he fought Death and... Death won ;)It is a worthy film, though, basically because it is good movie, with good directing and acting. Most of the actors are well known good actors, even the kid (Macaulay Culkin). However, the mood is dark and tense, you should really be prepared to watch it. Just seeing half of it before you switch it off will not do. Also, it is interesting to consider the possibility that he could have survived... then his story would have been filled with demons trying to keep him dead, wouldn't it?",Jacob's Ladder

So when I watched it tonite, I felt like I went through a major trip, this movie was so mentally disturbing to watch and very horrific, I wasn't even sure if it was a drama, thriller, horror, or maybe all.Jacob is a veteran soldier from Vietnam, he lives with his girlfriend, and he starts seeing these horrific images of demons all around. He has dealt with so much, he's lost his wife and children, including the death of his one child played by a very young Maculey Culkin, and he has dealt with the most nightmarish moments in Vietnam. He thinks he is alone, but then an old friend calls and it turns out that his whole team is having the same problems and are all having horrible car accidents, in order to Jacob to survive he has to get away from the men who are chasing him to shut him up for good.Jacob's Ladder is one of the most disturbing films I have seen in a long time, I was actually shaking after this film was done. A lot of the scenes were just so scary and you felt Tim Robbin's isolation and fear, he was so amazing and this was an incredibly under rated performance, but he's just plain wonderful. I would recommend this, but not for the light stomach, it's a bit graphic.7/10",Jacob's Ladder
27,Red-Barracuda,"A dark, mysterious and inventive drama",8,9 May 2012,"This film was a definite cult film back in the early 90's. It seems to have fallen somewhat out of fashion in the subsequent years. I think the reason for this is simply that the ideas Jacob's Ladder played around with were very new at the time of release and have subsequently become old hat as many films have expanded upon them in the years that followed. But I think it's important to remember that this movie had a lot of originality about it when released. Apparently it didn't do all that well at the cinema and was a bit of a sleeper; it seems that it might even have been a little ahead of its time.It tells the story of a man called Jacob who is bayoneted while on service in Vietnam. We pick up his story when he is back in New York. But this is an NYC of demons and lizard-like monsters just below the surface. Jacob is then made aware that something terrible happened that fateful night in 'Nam.Once you know the secrets of Jacob's Ladder it becomes clear why the New York City of this film just feels so wrong. The fact that there is never any sense of time having moved forward is clear once you know what is actually happening. There is always a sense of strangeness about this world, a place replete with biblical references. True horror always seems to be just below the surface. When Jacob ends up in hospital, he is taken through a mental ward that is a surrealist nightmare of deformed monsters. This is a truly inspired sequence of the macabre. The film never truly matches this moment at any other point but that's not to say that there is no other striking imagery; there's a reptilian sex scene at a party, ghostly beings in passing cars and trains and a nurse with a demonic horn.It may not seem as ground breaking as it once was but Jacob's Ladder remains an imaginative dark fantasy.",Jacob's Ladder

I'm torn between the two ideas - we do know Jacob did die in Vietnam but was it his visions/dreams OR are we witnessing his time in purgatory?

In an instant Jacob is brought forward in time, from 1971 to 1990, riding an empty New York Subway car in Brooklyn going to his job in the Post Office.Jacob has been having these flash-backs for some time and it destroyed his marriage to Sara, Patricia Kalember. These flash-backs are now putting pressure on his relationship with his live-in girlfriend, and fellow postal worker, Jezebel or Jazzi, Elizabeth Pena.With the hallucination's getting more and more profound and his grasp on reality slipping Jacob goes to see his doctor at the hospital. It's then that Jacob finds out, to his disbelief, that Dr. Cralson had been killed in a car explosion a month ago.It starts to take shape in Jacob's mind that the events in Vietnam back in 1971 has something to do with his mental condition now and tries to contact his fellow, and surviving, Vietnam Vets from the 5th Calv. Those GI's who were with him during that murderous attack that for some strange reason, after he was left unconscious with a bayonet wound, Jacob has no recollection of recovering from.The movie ""Jacob's Ladder"" takes on an almost dateless, or dreamlike, look right from the start. With it going back and forth in time with Jacob trying to find himself and at the same time his reason for being alive in, what seems to him, a world of the dead.It turns out that Jacob's suspicions of him and his fellow GI's being used in some military experiment back in Vietnam was true. This all comes out when Michael ,Matt Craven, who was in ""Nam"" working with the CIA gets in touch with him. Michael tells Jacob this strange story of his calvary unit being drugged to make them more aggressive and inhuman in fighting the Viet Cong guerrillas and North Vietnamese troops. What that drug did was get the entire unit so hopped up and crazy that they all ended up attacking and killing each other.The movie gets even weirder when we start, like Jacob, to sense that all that's happening is not real at all. Thats when we see Jacob's son Gabe (Macaualy Culkin),who was killed before Jacob was in Vietnam, and chiropractor Louis (Danny Aiello) acting as if their some kind of guardian angels protecting and at the same time guiding him through this hell on earth that he finds himself in.Once you give it up all is peaceful and serene and those departed that you miss the most are the one's who are there to guide and welcome you into the light. This is what the film ""Jacob's Ladder"" tries to tell it's audience and does it in a round about way. As Jacob Singer suffers through a series of unbelievably gruesome events that snaps his mind and leaves him almost insane.There's a very touching and eye-opening scene very late in the movie with Louis, who just rescued Jacob from being lobotomized, trying to explain what's been happening to him without giving away the films surprise ending. Jacob is like a man who somehow lost his soul and went through hell in trying to find it. Only to find out that his determination to hang on to life and not let go is what's causing the hell that he's been going through. Once he did let go his suffering was finally over and he found what he was looking for all throughout the movie :Peace.",Jacob's Ladder

Now it's up to Jacob to find out what's happening. Is it apart of an Army experiment in Nam that went wrong or is there actually more too it?Dark, weird, surreal, unpredictable and provocative are some words to describe director Adrian Lyne's intense psychological film. The premise of the film spirals into a world of alienation, disbelief and illusions. Where the film turns into a maze of amusement and sudden jolts as you just have to question this puzzle of a story about the mind and soul.The ingenious plot is filled with a lot of surprises and is incredibly unpredictable because ambiguity fills every corner, making nothing seem quite like it is. Which indeed the narrative is rather gripping, quite shocking and is rather out there, but never dull. The story is tight and dense on so many levels with its mix of stunning revelations and metaphors that seem to flow from one too another. Where picking up the little things and hints are the key to trying to understand what's happening. As we are constantly going back and forth in Jacob's life and watching his paranoia state building oh so slowly. It just becomes one baffling mystery. While the vibrantly solid and thought-provoking dialogue throughout the film sucks you right in as well.The stimulating atmosphere comes across as quite morbid, as it's filled with such pain and gloom. While it's helped out by the effectively stark and edgy lighting, the poignantly dreamlike music score and striking location cinematography that keeps the viewer under a false state. There are sound effects that are used to great effect in keeping such an uneasy mood. The visuals and make-up effects are truly bizarre and freaky, as the demons and head morphing images really stick in your mind.Lyne's direction sets up some incredibly well staged moments of suspense, tension and edginess. Where he builds such a murky and downbeat atmosphere that comes across as one surreal dream. You don't know what's actually real and what's not. The pace and editing is reasonably solid too. There are some disturbing scenes that play on the mind, a horrifically unnerving opening, fairly unusual imagery and strange occurrences. Though, what makes this movie standout is the powerfully overwhelming ending that I didn't see coming. It unexpectedly twisted back onto itself and leaves the film open too many different kinds of interruptions. The conclusion totally makes you question what you really saw on screen and what it all meant.There are good performances from the main leads and strong support cast. Excellent performances from Tim Robbins as Jacob, is he really losing it or is he drifting in and out of reality? Elizabeth Penn as Jacobs's worried girlfriend Jezebel.

32,Robert_duder,A bizarre and drug induced little gem with plenty of hidden political agenda amidst the craziness,7,9 July 2007,"Jacobs Ladder is by far something very unique. It takes the age old conspiracy theory of medication and chemical weapon usage in Vietnam and puts a whole new spin on it by giving us Jake (or Jacob), a post-Vietnam war veteran who suddenly starts to experience the bizarre world of demons and hidden conspiracies and a world that is haunting him after being shot in 'Nam. What Jacob's Ladder boils down to (and this is a major spoiler so don't read any further until you've seen the film), but Jacob's Ladder is the last of his life flashing before his eyes. He's descending the ladder into death because in reality he hasn't even left 'Nam and is dying on a stretcher and see his dead son, his ex-wife, his girlfriend, his best friends and comrades and the demons of death all around him. But you never know any of this until the film closes. Jacob's Ladder is dark, and very moody...very solemn and depressive and scary and the ambiance fits the entire mood of the film so that it works very well. It's just a little too dark and moody to really be incredibly effective and some of the performances aren't quite as bold as I would have hoped. Still Jacob's Ladder is a twisted little tale that will leave you breathless.Tim Robbins is terrific, really underrated I think as an actor and this small gem of a movie is no exception because his absolutely disturbing portrayal of the haunted Jacob is brilliant from his depression, to his fear to his total break down that he has. Robbins certainly handles the intensity of the role very well. The only problem is the supporting cast aren't strong enough to meet him half way although fortunately the supporting cast are all very back seat to his story. Elizabeth Peña plays Robbins' girlfriend who he appears to seek solace with but her help becomes too far from reach as he slips deeper into his hallucinations. Other than an attempt to make her eye candy (something this film does not need), Peña is rather bland and more gets in the way of Robbins' performance than she does add to it. She just always seems to pop up rather than be there for the role. Danny Aiello is appropriately creepy as Jacob's so-called chiropractor and has this air of wicked around him. It's hard to explain but he has this shadow that makes you doubt his motives and he does explain the 'ladder' theory to him. Also watch for a young and uncredited Macaulay Culkin as Jacob's dead son who plays a significant role in the film.The film is very stylish in many ways but also in some ways forgettable but that is almost the style of director Adrian Lyne who has made some very stylish and peculiar love stories (9 1/2 Weeks, Indecent Proposal, Unfaithful) and Jacob's Ladder adds to that peculiar list. Jacob's Ladder is very dull and bleached out and has this unique and significantly depressive way about it that makes you almost sad as you're watching it. That means you probably won't have a good time watching it but at the same time you can't not watch it...it's like having a bad dream much like Jacob is doing. The political message is not to forget Vietnam or what may or may not have happened there and although it's not forced down your throat by any means the flashing scenes of 'Nam and the brutal melt down Jacob experiences keeps the message at the front of your mind. It's worth seeing if not just to study the dark and depressing nature of Adrian Lyne's films. 7/10",Jacob's Ladder
33,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Up or down?,7,28 January 2021,"You're never quite sure what's going on in 'Jacob's Ladder (1990)', a piece which primarily explores the post-traumatic stress of its eponymous Vietnam veteran. It's an incredibly compelling mix of dreams and reality that keeps you on your toes throughout. It successfully shifts gears at a number of key points, almost feeling as though it belongs to a few entirely different genres. Yet, it somehow feels entirely cohesive. Its unique mix of psychological horror, grotesque imagery and structural delusion is surprisingly well-achieved. Though it's purposefully elusive, it's never frustrating. Even an ending that's a little too unambiguous for its own good doesn't dampen the flick's effect. Although the final beat falls a little flat (a text ending doesn't fit the film's overall vibe), the movie leaves you feeling satisfied. That may be because the climax still allows for a couple of different interpretations of the narrative. Sometimes, the movie seems a little too slow for its own good. A late game twist also potentially dampens the effect of a second viewing. It essentially represents the entire point of the picture, though, so there isn't really a way around the issue. After viewing the thing once, I can safely say that it's an atmospheric, engaging and entertaining in-the-moment experience.

It's not clear if he's suffering from PTSD, and the film gradually begins playing with the viewer's mind about dreams and reality, heaven and hell, and life and death. There are some great visuals here and the story is told with great pace, making it a very solid drama/thriller. I also just love Elizabeth Peña in this, and wish she would have gotten more opportunities in her film career.Favorite quote:

35,ironhorse_iv,"Jacob's ladder did climbs up the ladder to success: it's one of the scariest horror movies, I have ever saw.",8,3 September 2013,"After watching this psychological horror film directed by Adrian Lyne and written by Bruce Joel Rubin, you would end up with nightmares, too. The movie indeed delivers. The story centers around Vietnam veteran Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins), whose experiences both prior and during the war have resulted in abnormal flashbacks and haunting hallucinations to the point where he can't tell which reality is and which is fantasy. In his ordeal, he becomes worse, living in what might be call hell on earth for him. Jacob must desperately try to figure out the truth about what had happened during his service in Vietnam and what is happening to him now. The movie drew from several inspirations for its story and effects, from such works as 1962's short film An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and the paintings of Francis Bacon. There are a number of familiar themes and symbolism in this film that makes the movie a thinking man's film. This is a story with many possible interpretations, each valid. The movie's setting can most closely be associated with purgatory, but another facet of this masterpiece is that it should be seen in within a Christian context. The film's title refers to the biblical story of Jacob's Ladder or the dream of a meeting place between Heaven and Earth in the Book of Genesis. Its little-known alternate title is Dante's Inferno, in a reference to the painting Inferno by Dante Alighieri. Surprising, one of the biggest influences for the film came from the Tibetan Book of the Dead where the writer spent two years in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal before writing this film. It can also be interpretation as Marxist to some. A marxist could say that Jacobs role as a postman was a bourgeois attempt to control proletarians by making them imagine they are leading a surreal life. When Jacob was hanging around the subway and hallucinating, he could have been coming to terms with the grief of being proletarian. That would explain why he saw deformed human figures on a train. I also see Gestalt psychology in this film. Gestalt dream interpretation upholds the principle that everything in a dream somehow is an aspect of the dreamer himself/herself. This is one reason why I support the idea that everybody is a personification of Jacob himself dealing with guilt over what he thinks he's done to his Army buddies. Still, I have no idea about the interpretations of this movie, it's just a few ideas out there. The movie can be a bit confusing as it shifts back and forth between Jacob's chaotic memories of Vietnam, to this prior war memories, and then back to his present life as a mailman. Half of the time, you don't know what is going on. There is so many different sub-plots that it is hard to figure things out. You don't know if the army is out to get him, or if he is insane, or he's been dead the whole time. About the drug 'Ladder'. There are some theories that Jacob create the drug as he was a doctor before the war. In my opinion, there is no real drug in the movie. The drug is a metaphor of what triggers wars throughout history greed, anger, hatred. The more you go down the ladder, the more you come close to your primal state: anger, fear, aggression for survival. Jezzy (Elizabeth Pena) is a depiction of his life temptations and his refusal to die. I just wish they explain more about this character and make clearer. The movie can be a bit of a twist, but honestly, it's pretty predictable. The movie is just creepy to the point that it influence other horror movies. It even did influence the Silent Hill video games series. One of the scariest scenes in the film is the hospital ride from hell with all those shaking bodies. It give me goose bumps. The film was too overwhelming to some audience, that about 20 minutes of disturbing scenes, mostly from the last third of the film, were removed from the final cut. Watch the director cut version that have all these scenes add to it, it's one of the few films that the director cut was better than the original. There are moments of nonsensical over the top horror clichés that the movie added. I do have to say it's better than the original screenplay. It was just too explicit and too obvious. In a sense, I think the movie was more 'realistic'. The out of place things can be explain if you think about it. Through this spiritual journey, he encounters the spirits of his friends. All the actors did pretty well in their roles: Elizabeth Peña as Jezebel ""Jezzie"" Pipkin, Danny Aiello as Louis Denardo and even Macaulay Culkin as Gabe Singer. In my opinion, Macaulay looks out of place in this film. Tim Robbins was great in the film. He was just amazing. Just watch his reaction in the 'dream on' scene. Very heart breaking. This is really a great movie. An effective deep and dark film with a light message of peace and spirituality well-executed. Requires multiple viewings.",Jacob's Ladder

The basic set-up is nothing new, but Adrian Lyne's deft direction, coupled with Rubin's outstanding script, makes for a fascinating film. It's a down-to-earth approach to the metaphysical that's commendable. While I didn't really care for the final scene (I left the theater feeling that the filmmaker(s) had punked out), I've since come to accept it for what it is. Personally, I would've preferred it if the ascension into the light had been the final scene, but it is what it is. JACOB'S LADDER is still creepy, and remains one of only a handful of genuinely artistic fright films to have been crafted in the United $tate$.",Jacob's Ladder
38,TheMovieDiorama,Jacob's Ladder is a hallucinogenic psychological thriller that made myself hallucinate.,7,12 May 2018,"Another film that has garnered cult status over the years, more so for its unique nightmarish flashback narrative structure. I honestly had to sit in silence for a good ten minutes and attempt to string some words together to surmise this film. Simply put: ""A confusing mystery of confusing confusion"". *sigh*...I'm going to need my notebook next time. Jacob is wounded during the Vietnam war, years later he starts to see hallucinations and experience depressing flashbacks which leads him to investigate the sudden mental visions. I mean...how do I even collate adjectives and superlatives to create a review for this? It's so bizarrely executed that it left me questioning if this was a hidden masterpiece or just difficult for the sake of melting the brains of the audience. Currently, I sit in the middle. It's an intriguing perspective into a heightened mind during a visceral heart-pumping experience such as the Vietnam War, where secret experiments with hallucinogens were utilised as a means to increase aggression. That aside, the primary appeal to this thriller is the intricate narrative structure. Is it real? Fabricated? Nostalgic memories or malicious nightmares? The careful construct of the plot will leave you questioning every scene up until its conclusion (which still left me scratching my head occasionally). It's rapid pacing, consistently blending ghostly fantasies with reality, which certainly needs to be adjusted to. The constant transitions between flashbacks is jarring, particularly for the first half, but stick with it and all will be answered. Robbins gives yet another exceptional performance as a man undergoing psychological delusions. My main negative is the fact it was so...how to put it...""in your face"", that actually I cannot remember the majority of scenes. It's like a jigsaw puzzle, you don't remember slotting each piece in but you do acknowledge the final product. Jacob's Ladder is just that, an absurdly hallucinogenic jigsaw puzzle that definitely needs to be revisited again.",Jacob's Ladder

41,Vartiainen,The many forms of Hell on Earth,7,21 March 2017,"Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins), a Vietnam War veteran, works as a post office clerk despite having a PhD. His time in the army still haunts his daily life. And slowly it starts to become possible that this might hold true quite literally.Jacob's Ladder shines as a movie because of its sheer style and atmosphere. Its cinematography and set designs have that 80s urban grit to them, but the style overall leans more towards psychological horror and those things that lurk in the dark places of the world than is normal for the 80s. We quite quickly realize that Singer is suffering from visions, which makes us question all the events that follow and have happened before. But not in a bad way. Part of the unease and the horror is the unknown, the unreliability.The film is also shot really well. The urban grit works well mixed with visuals of horror. The dark alleys, the poorly lit apartments and the dirty rays of light permeate everything. One of the themes of the film is Hell on Earth, and we really get that. Obviously the flashbacks to war are horrendous and hellish, but even those scenes where Singer simply walks around in his crumbling city make us realize that he just exchanged one life of torment for another.One real problem I have with this film are the horror elements. They're visually impressive, but lack that spark otherwise. They're used sparingly, sometimes too much so, and we never quite get that gut punch required to make their presence in the film warranted. The same with the ending. Beautifully shot, but doesn't deliver on the story- level.Nevertheless, it's a great watch for all fans of mystery horror. Its imagery is top notch, its atmosphere is amazing and it will definitely feed your nightmares for a few nights to come.",Jacob's Ladder
42,robert-temple-1,Was It All Worth It?,4,31 March 2009,"Adrian Lyne here delivers one of his usual slick movies, but was it worth it? Tim Robbins, still looking rather baby-faced and pudgy despite his height and being over thirty, here delivers a beautifully judged and restrained performance, proving what a fine actor he is. It was only the next year that he achieved real fame, in 'The Player'. The story is about a group of Vietnam veterans who were unwittingly the subjects of a chemical experiment which went wrong, and are still feeling the nightmarish after-effects. This is always a topical subject, because everyone now knows that the Pentagon during that war was 'outtacontrol' and threw chemicals around like jelly beans, burning down a large proportion of the trees in Southeast Asia in order to kill two or three Cong, tinkering with the minds and emotions of their own men by giving them hallucinogens, and generally acting as most armies act in time of war. (Where there's a war there's friendly fire, fragging, and own-side casualties such as these.) But the film is a mess. Many parts of it are over-done to a ludicrous extent, there is far too much facial jiggling, much too much teasing of the viewer by letting him glimpse something but never enough, and other corny techniques. Jumping back and forth between fantasy and reality, normal life and dystopic hallucinations, doesn't make anything clearer. This is one of those movies where they think that if they are earnest, everybody will understand. In fact, it largely comes out as gobbledygook. And then there is Elizabeth Pena. She is really scary. And Danny Aiello is at his most menacing. It is all too much, much too much. Gimme a beer and turn that thing off, as they might grunt in, shall we say, the Bronx.",Jacob's Ladder

Now working as a mailman and living with his sexy girlfriend in New York he suffers ever increasingly horrific hallucinations. Tim Robbins delivers a solid performance and I really sympathized with his character. This film is a bit of a slow burn and perhaps too arty for many horror fans. I liked the fact that it's pretty original (others will disagree with that), intelligent, dark, well made and boasts some good special effects. Quite a viewing experience, one that makes the grey matter work. Personally I don't think of it as a masterpiece, hence my 7/10, but it has a cult following and I'm sure repeated viewings could bring out more to the viewer.

45,dee.reid,A further interpretation ***SPOILERS***,9,23 August 2002,"NOTE: the following is based on my own interpretations of the events in the film and the story, so correct me if you wish.  Ok, clearly everyone at this site knows that by now, Jacob (played by the never better Tim Robbins), is dead.  The majority of the film itself, which takes place after Jacob has returned from Vietnam, is Hell.  Take for example the scene in the subway. I believe that the film follows Jacob's ascent, hence the title, ""Jacob's Ladder"", from the depths of Hell to the gates Heaven.  The scene in the subway is the lowest level of Hell, which is where the train has brought him.  Jacob is annoyed that all the gates are locked (they're locked to prevent him from escaping).  Despite that, he is eventually able to get out. Ok, he manages to escape from the subway and now he's on the streets, another level.  He returns home to Jezebel (Elizabeth Pena).  The apartment that Jacob shares with her might as well be the Devil's lair and Jezebel might as well be the Devil him/herself or whatever, since she tries and often successfully, to deprive Jacob of any happy thoughts he might have. Jacob with some heavenly help, is eventually able to escape and find his way ""home"".      It seems that Jacob is not alone in his struggle to escape the grasp of the Devil.  Several of his old Vietnam buddies are having the same problem.  An old friend of his comes to him asking for help.  But it becomes increasingly apparent that as the story continues, he is powerless to help his friends. When they back out of his court case, you can conclude then, that his friends are already too deep in the Devil's grasp to be of any help to Jacob.  This entire segment of the film was meant to stray Jacob off course of his ascension.  Watch during the part of the film where Jacob is at the hospital.  As he is being wheeled on the bed by the ""doctors"" to his surgery, Jacob is constantly looking around him.  He's now back in one of the lower levels of Hell, to be more specific, the pits.  You will know what I'm talking about when you see all of the hideously scarred and deranged people in the hospital.  Note, that when you see the people in the cages above the hallway that he's in, you can clearly see a reddish glow in the background, as if something is burning, hence the fiery pits.  Then Danny Aiello's character, Louis, comes and rescues him.  Louis, as you can clearly see, is Jacob's guardian angel.  Louis ultimately sets Jacob on his path to Heaven.       Bearing all of this in mind, Jacob is caught in a struggle for his soul because the mood of the film is constantly changing.  You basically know when and where Jacob is just by the way you're feeling when you watch. 
Of course, this movie is not perfect.  The entire conspiracy thing does tend to get in the way of the storytelling, which is why I gave this film a nine instead of a ten.  But it was good effort though.I believe that ""tonyvoci"", who was the author of the previous comment, so far gives the best interpretation of the events in the movie.  Though I do feel that I am at a loss with one thing in the story.  If anyone knows what Paul's role in Jacob's ascension was, please post it up at this site.  I will be forever gracious.",Jacob's Ladder

Some other familiar actors showing up include Ving Rhames, Eriq La Salle, Danny Aiello, Jason Alexander, S. Epatha Merkeson, and Macauley Culkin. Quite a cast, as it turned out.

47,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"One of the scariest films ever made, in the best ways possible",9,11 July 2016,"Few supernatural horror films tap into the abstract realm of the unconscious quite as effectively as Adrian Lyne's Jacob's Ladder. There's a select group out there who have done it as well (Tarsem Singh with The Cell, Hellraiser and Silent Hill come to mind), but there's just such an abundance of generic, or 'vanilla' horror out there. It's not that that kind of stuff isn't great, I just like to see something strive for a little more, stylistically speaking, go for something truly elemental and out of the box in its attempts to elicit fright. This one engraves nightmares of an inexplicable variety into your perception, images and sounds made all the more disturbing by the fact that we never really know what is going on with our protagonist, a Viet Nam vet named Jacob (Tim Robbins), a decent dude with a sketchy past who spends his days as a postal worker in NYC. Jacob is plagued by waking nightmares, visions of demons, confusing allusions to his past and a son (a pre Home Alone Macauley Culkin) who may have died, or never existed at all, all combined with a general sense of dread that almost seems to crawl out of the screen and choke the viewer. Jacob is dating a co worker (RIP Elizabeth Pena), who isn't equipped to deal with whatever is going on with him, and his only friend seems to be his doting chiropractor Louis, played by an excellent Danny Aiello in a performance that is a ray of kindness and light in an otherwise ice cold atmospheric palette. Jacob begins to suspect that he and his platoon may have been victims of illegal weapons gas testing, and are now suffering the psychological fallout, or perhaps that his plight goes much deeper than that. It's a disorienting state of mind for him, and in turn puts the viewer in a similar daze of eeriness and uncertainty, with not a concrete clue or answer in sight until the film reaches its devastating final moments. Ving Rhames, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle and Matt Craven are just as haunted as his fellow Nam buddies, Jason Alexander has an energetic bit as a lawyer, and watch for Kyle Gass, Orson Bean and Lewis Black in early smaller roles. This film has put a hazy emotional and visual filter over my perception for years, and each time I give it another visit I get goosebumps from the horrors within, especially on a crisp recent blu Ray. There's one sequence in particular which I won't spoil with details, except to say it should be front and centre on the demo reel for the entire horror genre in cinema, a harrowing journey into a hellishly creative interzone of undefinable fear that still serves as the blueprint for some of my bad dreams to this day.

Jacob's Ladder is Jacob Singer's post Vietnam War experience that is chock full of disturbing visuals and a mind melting experience. The film looks great with tremendous special f/x and a dark and foreboding atmosphere. Fatal Attraction director Adrian Lyne made a very surreal, powerful and completely unique horror film that holds up as one of my all time favorites. The story is completely engrossing, yet bends reality with a series of plot twists that become clear at the film's conclusion. Tim Robbins is at his best here and comes off very natural and believable and along with The Shawshank Redemption, this is one of my favorite movies in the man's career in cinema.

I truly loved this film. Tim Robbins is excellent in his lead role as Jacob. Robbins is usually great in everything he is in, and this film is no exception. Without Robbins at the head of the film, it would have no emotional core. The film solely relies on him and his role, and Robbins is more than up to the effort. The supporting cast is also quite good, most notably Danny Aiello as Louis. There is something so surreal and yet so eerily relatable about the film in general. It plays similar themes to movies like Eraserhead and Rosemary's Baby creating a claustrophobic and nightmare eccentric atmosphere, that is truly hard to look away from, and even better than its predecessors before it. The screenplay for this film is genius. It's one of those films you can watch a dozen time and still find new things to spot each time around. It's a clever and surreal masterpiece that won't be leaving my mind anytime soon, and i'm certainly looking forward to watching it again sometime soon.

53,Samiam3,"Jacob's Ladder takes you fairly high up, without quite reaching the job",7,1 September 2010,"It's safe to argue I think that Jacob's Ladder is a good movie, but it felt to me like it could have been a great one. I know that some folks (including Roger Ebert) argue that it is a great movie, yet I see a bit of error. The problem (as is frequently the case with movies) is in storytelling. The plot elements don't come together in the best of fashions, leaving Jacob's Ladder without a clear sense of direction. One minute it's a horror film, the next minute, it's a thriller, then a war drama, then an emotional/psychological drama. Sometimes it's inventive, sometimes generic.What I DO like about the movie, is that is is almost always interesting. Tim Robbin's gives a credible and very 'human' performance, even though it is not his best work. Adrian Lynn's direction and photography are competent, and when it wants to be, Jacob's Ladder can actually be a real shocker. It is a movie that finds a balance between horror and heart, not too sentimental but not too sissy either. It starts to run out of steam a bit at the end, but I'll gladly say that left me satisfied.",Jacob's Ladder

There is a long sequence with flashing lights so watching this movie could be dangerous for you. Overall I liked this movie. The weird structure and severe ambiguity as to what was actually happened kind of annoying. There's nothing too special with how its shot or the music (the music wasn't bad it was just ok).

55,p-stepien,Jacob revisited,7,12 September 2012,"""Jacob's Ladder"" is admittedly a movie, which made an immense impact on me when first watched years back, albeit prone to not understanding the full story given my age at that time. Now but a fluttering memory I decided to revisit the surreal world created by Adrian Lyne in his sole venture into the genre of horror.Jacob (Tim Robbins), a war veteran, who survived a deadly attack by enemy forces in Vietnam, now leads a normal life as a postman. Nonetheless his reality is submerged in the past with countless flashbacks not only about the occurrences in Vietnam, but also of the loss of his son prior to the war. These increasingly influence his life as he slowly derails into morbid demonic hallucinations, which question his sanity and the reality that surrounds him. As the visions start to overcome him, he seeks the source of it all, quickly focusing on the military involvement in his madness...Adventurous vision still permeates through the screen with Cronenberg-influenced atrocities harrying Jacob and a tentative atmosphere of suspense building an engrossing movie, albeit flawed by overreaching ambition and lack of directorial competency vividly apparent. The dark and murky reality created by Adrian Lyne still however stay in force, embracing imagination in the way only movies from that period seem to be able to. Aided with a gripping story the venture into the mouth of madness keeps ""Jacob's Ladder"" an enthralling piece of cinema, albeit somewhat diluted as ideas and concepts used in the movie have been rehashed by the genre, making this original movie lose some of its punch.Nonetheless deeply atmospheric much in the manner of ""Videodrome"" or ""Harry Angel"" and with rough bleak camera work predominant in the era, keep it a classic worth watching.",Jacob's Ladder

This is an interesting film, which I never saw until today: Christmas Day, 2019; nearly 3 decades after initial release in 1990. The direction & casting is very good. At first, it looked like just another horror or (worse) zombie film. When this was first shown, you must take into account there was not the plethora of ""horror"" films we see today. Now, they are truly ubiquitous: There is an entire sub-genre of these movies. This was not the case in 1990. We had just finished the decade of ""Action Films"" (the 1980's). This starts out looking like just another horror film. Usually, these are cheap & over-the-top, with gratuitous graphic bloody images. They start out with precisely that & stay this way; never changing. This was exactly what I thought would occur here. I was wrong. In spite of some very graphic ""bloody images"" (which are somewhat gratuitous), the film gets better as it moves along. You don't know what is really occuring. I actually began to wonder about this. The plot comes down to one simple question: Are the images you see in Jake's mind, or, are they actually happening? Unfortunately, this is where the plot becomes far too ""overdone"". It also makes it predictable, which is one of the worst things that can happen to a film. It would have been much better if the writers and director had followed a ""less is more"" plotline. They don't, which isd the downfall of this film. Although fair and worth a watch, it is not memorable.",Jacob's Ladder

Tim Robbins delivers a unique performance as Jacob, a Vietnam warrior who gets seriously wounded in combat and finds himself in a desperate struggle for life. And between life and death, heaven or hell, where does Jacob belong? That's something Jacob will have to find out for himself and that'll be the fight of his life.Although the ending seems to be dark and ambiguous, I think the film proves to be intellectually and logically complete. If you see this movie merely as a hapless man's ordeal on physical world, you have missed the main point and I recommend to watch again: look beyond the visuals, don't think the events on a linear time scale and pay a strict attention (especially talking of Jacob's chiropractor, Dr. Louis) to the hints scattered throughout the movie.Tim Robbins' performance is flawless and fascinating. Adrian Lyne directed the movie very well; the emotions and the tension that are aimed to be brought about are achieved quite successfully. One interesting fact about the movie is that when you watch it for the second time, you notice a lot of things, which you did not notice or could not make sense out of in the first place. Names, small incidents, conversations, even the advertisement in the downtown train take on a new meaning once you know what is really happening to Jacob Singer.

59,moviewizguy,The most frightening thing about Jacob Singer's nightmare is that he isn't dreaming.,6,19 July 2009,"Adrian Lyne's JACOB'S LADDER moves in time and space between Vietnam and New York with hallucinatory force. Something bad happened on the Mekong Delta, on October 6, 1971, and it is still affecting war veteran Jacob in Brooklyn as he attempts to live a normal life with coworker and girlfriend Jezzie. Louis, an understanding chiropractor, tries to help him cope with his nightmarish visions--some of which occur at night, while others intrude into his daily life. When Jacob gets a call from Paul, who was with him in Vietnam, it seems that Jacob is not alone in his visions.I was pretty excited to see JACOB'S LADDER. It seemed like a very interesting little movie and it has gotten a lot of praise these past few years since after its release. I'll just say now it's a freaky disappointing movie. It's definitely one of the most weird, twisted movie I've ever seen. Some of the images in this film were disturbing, nevertheless unique. It's a visually interesting film with an interesting premise. In fact, my eyes were glued to the screen every second. I just wanted to know what happened.Well, once the whole truth was explained, I was disappointed and not surprised. Honestly, I knew what was going to happen because I've read short stories that ended similar to this film and I've seen films that had the same concept as this film. I think I've written a short story that had a similar concept of this film, but getting to the point, it was predictable and really disappointing. I wanted a better explanation although the explanation here was sufficient and seemed tolerable enough.Another downfall of this film is that even though I was interested in what will happen in the film, it's really uninvolving and dull. The score is really somber and quiet and some of the images splashed across the screen actually felt quite tedious. Actually, the movie experience was quite dreadful, which is a good thing for this movie. It manages to give the audience a feel of dread and foreboding. I think the castmembers did a decent job, though I don't have a name that stood out in here.Now I'll say something paradoxic: Even though I don't like the explanation in the film, I do like the ending. It's really different from the tone of the film and gives the audience an emotional catharsis after what they've endured in the previous scenes. Overall, JACOB'S LADDER isn't a pleasant movie to endure, but it makes people think and has people talking after the film, rather than being just another forgettable film.

60,Howlin Wolf,Lyne takes liberties with the material AND the audience...,1,10 May 2001,"He's not the first to do it, and I'm sure he won't be the last, but Lyne has taken incredible liberties with both the material he has been given and the audience who pay to be entertained.  Just the merest hint of the plotline - ""Vietnam vet is plagued by disturbing occurrences"" - is sure to have had Lyne in a paroxysm of glee.  ""Oh goody, I get to be experimental!"", he doubtless thought.  Let me tell him that there is a fine line between producing an experimental movie and a shambolic mess; which is what this film becomes.   It starts off well, but by the middle section just dissolves into an exercise where 'plot' no longer seems to be a consideration.  The best efforts of Tim Robbins could not prevent me from becoming angry at the dismantling of such an intriguing setup.   There may be those of you who think that I do not like David Lynch because he is often called 'experimental'.  This could not be more wrong.  I love ""Blue Velvet"" and like ""Lost Highway"" despite not really understanding the latter.  The difference between a Lynch film and this is that Lynch NEVER takes advantage of the material he is given in order to be weird.  He just does what he does, and if you do not like it, then that is your lookout.  Lyne is a director whose other films have been pretty linear, and who obviously used this project as a way of indulging himself, with no thought for those in the audience who might like a coherent plot - or at the very least a CONSISTENT one.   An ambiguous storyline like this is not sufficient excuse for such a lack of structure.  One of the most misdirected films I have seen.",Jacob's Ladder

63,BrandtSponseller,"The grandfather of ""rubber reality"" films",10,1 March 2005,"The film begins with Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) and his platoon in Vietnam. When they're suddenly attacked, it's chaos, and the platoon appear to be the victims of some kind of chemical warfare. Jacob is stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet. Suddenly, without explanation, we see Jacob back in New York City. He's returned home from the war and he's trying to get his life back on track, but he keeps having odd experiences, seeing odd, frightening people, and having close calls with death. He cannot tell ""dreams"" from reality. What happened to him in Vietnam? Jacob's Ladder is the grandfather of the ""rubber reality"" films that became so popular throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. The films with the most direct influence from Jacob's Ladder have appeared more recently-- Memento (2000), Mulholland Dr. (2001), The I Inside (2003), and The Butterfly Effect (2004). Less obvious, but also strongly influenced are films such as Abre los ojos (1997)/Vanilla Sky (2001), eXistenZ (1999), The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and The Matrix (1999), as well as films where the ""rubber reality"" is usually played more straight, such as The Sixth Sense (1999) and The Others (2001).Of course, like any artwork, Jacob's Ladder has its precursors, too, such as the short story by Ambrose Bierce called ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"", which was originally published in 1891 and later used as a basis of a silent film called The Spy (1929), and then a French short entitled La Riviere du hibou (literally ""The River of the Owl""), the latter also airing as an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" (1959). There is a very strong religious/mythical allegory running throughout the film--seen in everything from the Judeo/Christian nature of the character's names and the title of the film itself to character interests, as Jacob begins extensively studying demonology, the occult and so forth in an attempt to figure out what is happening to him. We are also treated to subtle connections with other works, such as philosopher Albert Camus' novel L'Etranger (""The Stranger""), which Jacob is reading in the film when we first see him on the subway, and there are many at least subtle stylistic and content precursors, such as Altered States (1980).In light of the subsequent instantiations of the film's brand of rubberizing reality, as well as the more purely stylistic elements that have been used to often excellent effect in later films, such as the hyper kinetic figural motion that found its way into William Malone's films House on Haunted Hill (1999) and Fear dot Com (2002), Jacob's Ladder may seem relatively transparent or even tame. It's certainly easier to reach an interpretation for this than for a film like Mulholland Dr., where director David Lynch is purposefully obfuscatory. Still, Jacob's Ladder is one of the better films of its kind. Director Adrian Lyne achieved a continually offsetting creepiness that is rarely matched, and some scenes--such as the gurney journey through the increasingly dilapidated hospital corridors, could not possibly be topped.Seen in the context of Lyne's other films Jacob's Ladder is all the more surprising, as the bulk of his career has been focused on hyper sensual and sexy dramas and thrillers--such as 9 1/2 Weeks (1986), Fatal Attraction (1987), Indecent Proposal (1993), Lolita (1997) and Unfaithful (2002). Jacob's Ladder has its share of eroticism, however, mostly through the gorgeous and impassioned Jezebel (Elizabeth Pena), even though her most heated moment has her appropriately fraternizing with a demon.Lyne's relatively straightforward approach to the film's elastic ontology, especially in conjunction with his tendency to be forthcoming and thorough in explaining his view of the plot (a predilection shared by scriptwriter Bruce Joel Rubin) may be unfortunate in that there is an interpretation of Jacob's Ladder accepted by a vast majority as the ""right answer"". That's a shame because there are countless possible readings of this material; differing views on everything from the general crux to the smallest minutiae. Part of the inherent beauty of the film is that any scene or set of scenes may equally be taken as the ""real events"", and any of the dialogue may be taken as providing clues to your preferred interpretation.Robbins' performance is important to the film in that he is the focal point of almost every scene and has to convincingly play a vast range of emotions; he does so with finesse. The rest of the cast is noteworthy, even though their questionable nature gives them a lot of leeway in terms of verisimilitude and consistency.But the real driving force that makes Jacob's Ladder such a success is its eeriness. This is a horror film after all, both on psychological and more apparent supernatural levels. Lyne continually and disconcertingly pulls the rug from beneath not only Jacob, but the audience as well, yet manages to never make a viewer feel lost, instead producing an eagerness to solve the ""mystery"" while you root for Jacob.",Jacob's Ladder
64,KnightsofNi11,A haunting experience,8,8 July 2011,"Get ready for extreme creepiness and deranged horrors the likes of which are familiar but not. Jacob's Ladder is about Jacob Singer, a Vietnam war veteran who can't cope with life back at home. He has demonic visions that slowly convince him he is descending into Hell. He desperately searches for answers but is only delivered more questions as he tries to find out why these horrific things are happening to him. The film twists and turns as it spirals down a dark path towards insanity. While watching this film you can never be too sure of what is real and what is hallucination. Reality is blurred to hellish extremes in this film, making it a disturbing yet fascinating experience.Jacob's Ladder begins interestingly enough. It is a little odd and you are sort of just dragged along as the character of Jacob Singer is introduced. We learn that Jacob has a girlfriend but he was once married. He had three kids with his ex-wife, one of which died in an accident. The film jumps back and forth between Vietnam and present day while strange little things begin to happen. Jacob has very odd visions that have a subtle creep factor to them that starts off the mood of the film very well. The film has excellent pacing and it builds very well. The visions become more and more terrifying as things start to come together. And when I say come together I use the term very loosely. We think the film makes more and more sense as it goes along, but everything we piece together we see through the veil of the unreliable narrator. You really can't discern what is real and what isn't. There is mystery in everything and we have no real way of knowing what is actually happening. We are pushed along through this maze with Jacob, making the experience as frightening and confusing for us as it is for him. Jacob's Ladder is almost more of an experience than a film.This movie puts you in a kind of trance. I was hypnotized by the film and I didn't even realize it until the film ended. It was a very odd experience because this film really got into my head, forcing me to watch with unmoving bewilderment. But when the film ended and I came out of the trance I wasn't entirely sure what I had just sat through. I was more focused on piecing together that experience rather than forming an opinion on the film itself. I'm honestly not sure what I thought about this movie. What I do know is that it had some sort of affect on me and for that I can consider it to be a very good film. The whole film captures that dream like quality so well, only it is more of a nightmare quality. The film sets out to be a story of existential terror and it achieves that so I can say that this is a great film just based on the more straightforward opinions I did form about the film.Jacob's Ladder is like a puzzle. You start with all the individual pieces that make no sense apart but when put together they begin to make some sort of sense. You slowly piece together this puzzle, jumping around and finding matches here and there, drawing connections and having things start to come into focus little by little. And then after fighting through this puzzle you almost piece together everything and as things start to make sense the table is flipped and the puzzle comes crashing to the floor, shattering into all its individual pieces once again. Then you look through the wreckage and realize that all the answers were there from the start before you ever started piecing things together. And yet you are still haunted by this puzzle and you will be no matter what. You would have to see the film to understand these ramblings of mine so go see it. It is an excellent film.",Jacob's Ladder
65,jluis1984,Brilliant nightmarish thriller!,9,9 January 2007,"When talking about movies, many people tend to quickly dismiss the artistic values and overall quality of the horror genre by describing it as a clichéd, predictable and juvenile source of entertainment; and while probably most of the popular and well-known horror films do tend to have those characteristics in common (as after all, they are meant to sell), the really good movies of the genre are the complete opposite of that idea, and often are as worthy of praise and study as any other good film. Adrian Lyne's 1990 masterpiece, ""Jacob's Ladder"", is one of those films that break the typical (and usually false) conception of what a horror movie should be, and by exploring the dark corners of the mind, shows off the unlimited potential of the horror genre as an art form.""Jacob's Ladder"" is the story of Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) a Vietnam war veteran who works as postal worker and is trying to start a new life with his girlfriend Jezebel (Elizabeth Peña) after his ex-wife Sarah (Patricia Kalember) divorced him. However, his sanity begins to fade as he is troubled by horrible hallucinations and increasingly severe flashbacks to his days in the war, his previous marriage, and to the years before his little son Gabriel (Macaulay Culkin) died. The visions of monsters and the return of the horrors of the war start to become dangerous to Jacob as the hallucinations get more real as time goes by, but as the line between reality and illusion gets blurred, the discovery that everything is the result of the Army's experimentation on the soldiers just makes his troubles more difficult.Written by Bruce Joel Rubin, ""Jacob's Ladder""'s hallucinatory trip to madness is easily one of the most captivating and vivid portrayals of insanity ever put on film, and most of the film's success is thanks to Rubin's cleverly devised script. Complex and multi-layered, Rubin takes Jacob (and us with him) through hell and back in his quest for an explanation to what is happening to him, but given the unpredictable nature of his mental condition, there is never an only answer to the bizarre series of events that happen in his life. As in other of his works, Rubin adds a lot of ideas about life and soul, but unlike the rest of his work, in ""Jacob's Ladder"" he explores a darker side of the nature of such concepts. While at first sight all this may sound too ambitious and contrived, Rubin makes it work and the final result is one of the most original movies (not just horror) ever written.While he is better know for his high quality erotic thrillers, director Adrian Lyne does a remarkable job (probably the best in his career) at giving life to Bruce Joel Rubin's story of insanity and horror. As always, Lyne makes an effective job directing the film, but this time he allows himself some experimentation with the camera and the special effects which results in very original (and influential) visual effects, creating a very disturbing atmosphere of decay and disorder that mirrors Jacob's own state of mind. As he worked closely with Rubin in the screenplay, Lyne decided to keep the ambiguity of the film's plot by focusing only on Jacob, but this also allowed him to keep the story's humanity and soul.Tim Robbins is simply perfect as Jacob Singer, and this is definitely one of the best works of this very underrated actor. His portrait of Jacob is frighteningly believable and one of the highlights of the film. Elizabeth Peña is very good as Jacob's girlfriend, but as the film focuses completely on Jacob, there is nothing really amazing or surprising in her delivery. Danny Aiello appears in a small but very important role as Jacob's chiropractor and only friend Louis, who acts as a spiritual guide in Jacob's attempt to understand his experiences. Aiello may have a limited screen time, but he makes the most of it and delivers an unforgettable performance. Macaulay Culkin appears briefly, and one can notice that the kid had a big precocious talent at the time.""Jacob's Ladder"" is definitely one of the most original films of the 90s, due not only to it's brilliant storyline, but also to the way Lyne crafted the film in a simple yet very effective way. While many have criticized the film for having an ""incoherent"" plot, it's actually the challenging complexity of the script where the main strength of the film is; and while I admit it's difficult to get at first time, it's one of those films that get better with time as the many details of its plot become better appreciated in subsequent viewings. As one of the best examples of a ""psychological thriller"" (a term used very loosely these days), this movie offers a delightful mix of mystery, suspense and horror that few movies can equal.Adrian Lyne's masterpiece of horror, ""Jacob's Ladder"", is a very recommended film to fans of atmospheric and eerie horror films, as this movie proves that the genre is more than guts and gore, and that it can serve to explore limitless possibilities. Personally, this movie has become a favorite of mine because of its captivating plot and near-perfect film-making. An excellent film of the 90s. 9/10",Jacob's Ladder

As it is, it's fairly easy to spot from miles away; that means that there's no need to judge the film by its twist, and, thankfully, allows us to watch it not as a mystery thriller but as a surreal psychological drama. Even without the surprise effect Jacob's Ladder is an incredibly powerful movie, that sets the viewer into an uncomfortable atmosphere.

I only watched it today for the very first time, but as long as I was watching it many other films were appearing on my mind as I was thinking: ""I've been watching these scenes in many other recent movies"". In fact, it seems quite obvious that JACOB'S LADDER has inspired many recent movies like THE SIXTH SENSE, THE OTHERS, STAY, November (which I watched yesterday!), DARK CORNERS and even some David Lynch's works, just to mention those I have watched.It's really a great film in its message, in the plot, the production (if we remember it has almost twenty years now, we must say the production is excellent!), the cinematography, the surreal scenarios and weird scenes, like the ones at the party or at the hospital.I didn't get surprised by the ending just because of three main reasons: 1) at the beginning I already knew the thematic of the movie; 2) some clues are given along the movie to the final disclosure; 3) but especially this one: I've been watching many films with this thematic in the last years so I'm already prepared to this kind of ending. Otherwise, and especially if I had watched it at the time this movie was produced, I bet I (and many other people either) would be surprised by that ending Even the title is excellent, because it's a good metaphor to the movie's main thematic.",Jacob's Ladder

To do so, he must decipher reality and life from his own dreams, delusion, and perception of death. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant.

72,Bogmeister,"Oh, Misery - Trapped Between Heaven and Hell",10,26 February 2006,"Those who are dismissive of this film usually describe it as an extended ""Twilight Zone"" episode - in itself not a bad criticism anyway. Oddly enough, it most resembles ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" a portion of a French film from '62 which was slotted into the Twilight Zone series for one night. Another episode it resembles is ""Shadowplay"" - which examined what little difference there may be between dreams and so-called reality. The point is, when we dream, we usually accept it as reality while dreaming, until we wake up. Here, the main character of Jacob (Robbins) seems to gradually find himself in the middle of a nightmare from which there is no escape. The film captures the dreamlike quality usually evoked in the better films - films are our dreams in a general sense regardless - and here it's done with purpose, seasoned with a nightmarish tinge. A viewer will note this quality very early, as in the subway sequence where Jacob can't seem to step out of the way of an oncoming train. It calls to mind those disturbing dreams where we're running or evading and can't escape no matter what we do.The film accomplishes what it sets out to do by bombarding the audience with tactile sensory impressions (especially effective on a huge movie screen) and an unwavering mood of escalating dread, doom and despair. Also quite effective is the remarkable musical score by Jarre, whether accentuating a sense of melancholy or the sinister design threading through the story. With its unique style, one would think this is a film of the seventies - edgy, unbalancing, discomforting, layered, stressing Vietnam horrors - and, indeed, it was first conceptualized in that decade; it just didn't make it to the screen until over 10 years later. There's a slow deliberate pace which those accustomed to the quick cutting of the nineties onward may find difficult to appreciate. I also believe that the premise of the story can be applied to the various viewers of the film: if you're completely at peace with yourself and the world, with no serious problems troubling your mind, you may gaze at this film bemused, holding it at arm's length. However, if you're grappling with personal demons and unanswered questions, this film may cause more questions to surface: 'Are you really where you are, in that house or apartment, and doing the work you do? Or are you...really...somewhere else?'",Jacob's Ladder
73,LoneWolfAndCub,"An intense, creepy psychological thriller with an amazing ending",10,17 July 2007,"Jacob's Ladder is one of those rare films that drags the viewer in, tosses them about and then spits them back out not quite knowing what they have just seen. Watching this movie was an experience, instead of just watching it I felt it. Some of the hallucination scenes were genuinely terrifying and brutal, like nothing I had ever seen before. This was partly because of Tim Robbins realistic performance as the main character Jacob Singer, a Vietnam veteran who is started to see demons throughout his daily life. I won't go into any more details about the plot as it would be no use and it would spoil the experience for any first-time viewers.Adrian Lyne's direction was what also made this film so interesting and unique. He doesn't spoon feed the audience with answers, we aren't served all the answers on a platter. Jacob's Ladder requires the viewers to do the thinking and come up with the answers. It's not an easy film to stomach but if you can you will be rewarded with an intelligent film experience that will surely remain with you for the rest rest of your movie-going life.

It explores the life of an ex-Vietnam soldier who returns to mainstream life after suffering a particularly traumatic experience and attempts to put the pieces back together to understand why he is in such a state years later. The film explores human psychology through strong imagery, and cinematic expression, in ways that are all of frightening and vivid, subtle and emotional, and very intellectually stimulating. The story is perfectly constructed, the acting solid throughout, and it sets up the main character in exactly the right environment of a double life so that he and the viewer may discover and unravel the truth about it all bit by bit as the suspense grows and the anticipation for something huge to drop at the end rings with eagerness.

In fact at one point it was called one of the ten best un-filmed screenplays in Hollywood. It's not hard to see why either, as this film is a unique mind-trip that takes a number of twists through out its plot line. Jacob's Ladder is an emotionally powerful film as well. Thanks to its likable main character (lovingly played by Tim Robbins) this film runs from emotions of utter terror; as our hero inexplicably sees demons, to moving sadness; as Jacob recalls his deceased young son. This film is an unnerving and compelling journey the whole way.The direction of Adrien Lyne (director of the 1987 hit Fatal Attraction) is beautifully well done. The film is heavy on dark atmosphere and effectively scary imagery. The moody music score by Maurice Jarre also adds to the spookiness.The cast is excellent, the best of which is Robbins as our sympathetic and heart-felt hero.Jacob's Ladder is the kind of film that offers a mind-blowing journey that most films can only hope for.

This movie skates a fine line between a normal reality twister sci fi movie such as Total Recall or The Matrix and horror movie such as The Exorcist.

Maybe it was because my expectations of the film were lower or I have matured in past few years. Anyway, this is a highly fascinating and entertaining thriller about a Vietnam veteran who always feels like there is somebody or something ""out to get him"". He feels this way because he keeps seeing strange images and many people in which he comes in contact with appear to have horns growing out of their heads and whatnot. Him and his war buddies believe that these strange occurrences are the result of something that happened during the war. The best element of this film is its atmosphere and paranormal feel which will really give you the creeps as well as have you guessing what the cause of the strange occurrences that are affecting Jacob really are.

The story is told trough several timelines, the first is a pre-Vietnam tragic accident that ends in the death of the youngest son of our main character, played by Tim Robbins. The second storyline chronologically is the events that occur in Vietnam during a tragic attack that results in the loss of almost all of Tim Robbin's unit and results in a potentially fatal stabbing of Tim Robbin's character. The third major storyline is post Vietnam and Tim Robbin's is suffering from what would seem to be PTSD, is divorced from his wife, living in a shoebox apartment with a colleague from the post office who has become his love interest, played by the gorgeous Elizabeth Peña.This was a recommendation from a friend and dealt with some of the psychological aspects of war and questions our government using our own soldiers to experiment on.This is an interesting study in the story telling technique that uses an unreliable narrator.

The characters are tragic and bland in nature, all portraying people that are in desperate situations or stuck in a terrible rut. It's safe to say, that Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Pena exceeded any expectation in this movie, both being somewhat risky parts to play in their given roles.The attention to detail in many of the demonic horror scenes is striking and gives a great opportunity to the viewer to re-watch and pick up something different. Throughout all of the film's scenes it's noticeable that the dialogue and script is carefully calculated, having very few plot-holes. The story constantly flips back and forth introducing new characters and time periods, becoming borderline confusing at parts. However, after multiple times watching the film and being comfortable with the film's direction and messages, it not too hard to understand after thinking about it.

The center is the time spent in Purgatory, mostly the seventh terrace (for the lustful). The finale resolves in the ninth sphere of Paradise (with the angel). As a trip through the three realms of the dead, this glances off of Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"".The style is noir, so the main character is ground up by the machinery of his fate. To heighten the dislocation, Lyne casts a clueless actor to play the clueless main character.What is difficult to depict visually is the theological ruminations of Meister Eckhart (using Aiello as the medium -- he steals the show). There's no subtle way to do this in a popular film, so the essence of Eckhart is simply announced. Along the way, Lyne references his own ""Fatal Attraction"" - use of the bathtub - to 'liquefy the soul'.Lyne makes a complete investment in a world - Kimball's cinematography is the centerpiece here. Every last detail, every lock of hair, every costume and song (esp. ""My Thang"" from James Brown's ""Hell"") reconstructs New York of the late 1970s -- it convincingly looks and feels like a period movie. The car abduction borrows straight from ""French Connection"" (note the baby carriage).This could have been one of the greats -- a cinematic self-examination of the soul -- unfortunately, they chose to turn this into an indictment of the 'government'. This is worse than tarnish, it completely ruins the containment of the narrative. Whatever we believe or reject about 'conspiracies', it's an argument for another place and time; there was no need to go down that road here. Tsk, Tsk.",Jacob's Ladder
85,christian94,Entering the 90s with a Bang!,7,10 July 2007,"This avant-garde adventure is a mind trip that Adrian Lyne created effectively with the underlying strong and peculiar screenplay. Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Peña act very well and change the viewer's perspective constantly with their shifting demeanors. Lyne's directing is crucial in being able to be disjointed while being somewhat coherent and captivating. There are frequent frightening elements mixed with paranoia, confusion and ordinary day-to-day life. The film has a societal message as well as a more personal one. The layers of complexities are not daunting, but are woven in such a way that the viewer is well engrossed into the narrative, empathize, feel and think.An innovative film with lasting effect, this can be characterized as a tuned down version of Cronenberg's ""Naked Lunch (1991)"" and a precursor to many other noteworthy films such as ""Dark City (1998)"" & ""Abre Los Ojos (1997)"" / ""Vanila Sky (2001)""",Jacob's Ladder
86,undeaddt,Tim Robbins's second best.,7,31 October 2018,"For 2h I thought, hey, I might be wrong, but this for me is the best Tim Robbins movie I've ever watched. Every about this movie is crazy and amazing at the same time because the way the director channels the PTSD effects on to the screen through the eyes of Jacob is out of this world. The delusions and fictional things he sees are more scary than 10 horror movies watched one after another on a Halloween night. The way the story progresses and how we see him falling apart day by day, seeing more and more and more of those grim things, mixing reality with dreaming, friends with foes. He has friends around him doesn't he ? A girlfriend that loves him, a divorced wife that still cares for him, all the others kids except the one that passed away, but he is still alone isn't he ? He is alone in his own world fighting his own demons who grow bigger with every thought and resemblance to his dead child, and that is what depression an dilusion is all about. Nobody understands you, until they are the ones that can't be understood. When the ending came, I knew it would end up that way, but I was yet a bit dissapointed because there was a lot of build up just so it ends like that, altho it was a logical ending.",Jacob's Ladder
87,The_Core,"Stunning, Atmospheric...",9,6 February 2001,"""Jacob's Ladder"" is one of the most atmospheric movies ever filmed.  I'm afraid to say too much here because it may give away the plot, but imagine how alone you might feel going through the experience of dying, what the whole experience might be like.  Now project that nightmarish atmosphere into a film, and you have ""Jacob's Ladder.""This film has been overlooked by much of the moviegoing public.  Many will find it too baffling and depressing to sit through, but if you (are able to) give it a chance, the ending will just blow you out of your chair.  There's such a massive plot twist at the end, and it explains the whole film.  Yes, this is one of those films where you don't really know what's going on until the end, but the fun is in the journey, not the destination.You may not be entertained by this film.  The overall atmosphere is so dark, so haunting and feverish and nightmarish that it's very hard to take.  But I have to say this is in my top-ten list of favorite films based on originality and atmosphere alone.  The acting is so-so except for Tim Robbins, who brings a lot of ""life"" to the part.*** Minor Spoiler Below ***There's a sub-plot involving a ""chemical warfare"" agent that really doesn't fit with the rest of the film (if you take the ending to explain the entire film, it doesn't work out right).  But that's a minor quibble (to me), because this film is so leaden with horrific atmosphere, it could put Santa Claus in the hospital with a case of clinical depression.9/10 (would be 10/10 except for the no-fit 'chemical agent' subplot).",Jacob's Ladder
88,The_Core,It all falls apart...,9,19 January 2003,"Less than a year ago, I would have given this film 5 stars.  Therefore, it's with great reluctance then that I give it only 3 stars in this review -- let me explain why.** SPOILERS ALERT **Without going into material that's been discussed a thousand times already, there are basically two interpretations of this film that make sense (without stretching things too far).  One possibility (and to me, the most likely) is that Jacob is dying in Vietnam, and his ""current"" life in NYC is simply the imaginings of a fevered brain (and his clinging to life), and at the end of the movie he ""makes his peace"" and passes away.  This is the ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" theory.  The problem with this interpretation is that it basically leaves the mind altering drug subplot unexplained (how could he know, if he was dying?).  It also fails to explain why he's repeatedly told ""you're already dead"" throughout the film (the palm reader, in the hospital, ""you killed each other"" stated by the chemist toward the end.The other potential interpretation is that Jacob was dead from the start of the film, and the flashbacks to Vietnam actually are flashbacks, and that Jacob is a ghost in purgatory or something.  This takes care of the subplot involving the drug, but it fails to explain the synchronicities between the ""vietnam flashbacks"" and his ""current"" experiences.  Worse yet, it destroys the ending of the film -- the light at the top of the staircase fading to the light being turned off at the operating table, and Jacob being declared dead in Vietnam.  If he's a ghost, why does the screenplay try to fool the audience at the very end by suggesting that he was gradually dying throughout the film? In the final analysis, ""Jacob's Ladder"" is not open to interpretation at all, as has been stated by many people.  Rather, it's completely closed to interpretation, since choosing either of the two possibilities leaves a large number of plot holes and implausibilities, making the film look ridiculous.In making either interpretation possible, the filmmakers have actually made *neither one* satisfactory or true to the plot (which is much more manipulative than I had previously thought, especially after reading the original screenplay).  With the plot down the tubes, the film has nothing left to ride on except atmosphere, acting, special effects, etc.1/10 for the plot, 4/10 for everything else, 5/10 total.  Too bad, I used to really like this movie.",Jacob's Ladder
89,The_Core,Rating revised yet again...,9,6 June 2003,"There will never be another Hollywood movie made about death again.  At least not like this... not without angels, fruit bowls, and Meg Ryan floating in the sky with Nicolas Cage.Recently, I revised my *second* rating on this film to something very low, due to the ending and the way it skews the plot no matter how it's interpreted.Also recently, I had a death in the family, and watched this introspective, philosophical, brutally honest film again with tears streaming down my face.I can't help but succumb to the blunt atmospherics, the almost-entirely-sincere portrayal of clinging/surrender/ ultimate release, and.... just the fact that it could have ever gotten made.  In early 1990's Hollywood.  As with the film ""Dead Man Walking,"" I stand in awe with head bowed.  It's so interesting that Tim Robbins was involved in both of those movies.  And with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" too -- the man is a marvel.This isn't a horror film, folks, unless you look upon your own death with horror.  Unless you look upon the death of those you love with horror.  If so, you may not be really living.  Look again. 9/10.  It could have been perfect, if the ending hadn't been *too* ambiguous (doesn't work very well however you take it).",Jacob's Ladder

We follow the life of Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) after he gets back from Vietnam. Strange things start happening to him and he starts seeing things. When he is asleep, he has the same dream over and over about a massacre in Vietnam. Reality slips in and out with some frequency until the end when you find out all you thought was a dream, was actually happening, and the reality was the dream.Well, Bleh!!! One of the first things I learned in my creative writing class is the ""and then I woke up"" ruse in stories is a cheat and I felt cheated here. We go through some BRUTAL and I mean BRUTAL scenes in this movie and we go through the same hell Jacob Singer goes through.

92,Christopher_Reid,"Very emotionally affecting, engaging to watch and quite profoundly sad",9,17 January 2015,"Jacob's Ladder is not a horror. It's really a drama with some aspects of a thriller. I didn't find it very scary. There are horrific moments but they're more about sadness and despair. We suspect from near the start that many of the things Jacob (Tim Robbins) sees are not real. They seem to be hallucinations. Which gives us an easy explanation with which to dismiss anything we don't understand: he's crazy. But naturally, the plot thickens. He wants to know what caused his situation, why is he like this? He's a Vietnam veteran but his memories seem incomplete. Something horrible happened when he was there and maybe due to shock he's blocked out some of the details, we aren't sure.Although the film could certainly be interpreted in different and interesting ways, I feel like it's quite clear what was going on by the end. Before writing this review I felt compelled to write in detail what my logical interpretation of the movie was, to get it clear and understand it properly. I'm sure it will stay in my mind and evolve over time. It touches on surreal, intense ideas. It may possibly be extremely realistic.There are times when you could become frustrated watching a movie like this. The writer/director can do whatever they want, tease and taunt you and while you hope it'll make sense by the end, it very well might not. You begin to wonder when you'll get some answers and when the whole point of it is going to sink in. But with Jacob's Ladder, we have a constant throughout: we feel the same way as Jacob. There are emotions to connect with the whole time. He is perhaps suffering from PTSD, but it doesn't matter. He's seems alive and sane but something horrible is happening to him. That's the worst thing about illnesses sometimes is not knowing what caused them or whether they will improve or not.The ending really impacted on me. Everything began to fit together and make sense. Everything had an explanation. It was moving and sad and shocking. A few of these weird semi-horror movies like The Wicker Man and this just make me want to hug and comfort the main character so much. Their pain is heart-breaking. But in that way it makes you feel less alone. Whatever suffering you go through, you can always remember these characters and feel a deep connection.There are interesting connections to the bible including several character names (Jacob, Jezzabel, Eli and Gabe) and references to demons and angels (and visions of them). The writer apparently was interested in Buddhism and there is an idea of letting things go. By carrying painful memories, you increase your suffering. You can't change them but you can move on and maybe find new happy experiences. Death is a bit of a theme throughout as well. It reminds me of the samurai code where you accept your inevitable death and progress from there. You will notice also that Jacob is often seen lying down, maybe mirroring the fact that he seems to be having a never-ending nightmare.",Jacob's Ladder

94,freaky_dave,Very disturbing film but a good one indeed,8,29 April 2006,"Jacob's ladder was one disturbing film. It stars Tim Robbins as Jacob Singer, and Robbins is perfect for the role. He was vulnerable and sad, and gave us a strong character we could sympathize with. If anybody could not feel sympathy for him, then there is definitely something wrong with you. Now on with the story.Jacob Singer, after returning from Vietnam where he was stabbed, begins to have hallucinations and very disturbing dreams involving his life before Vietnam and his life after. Not only that but he sees strange creatures which seem to be following him around and also at times seem to become one with the people he knows. Believing that chemical warfare in Vietnam has caused this, he goes about trying to find out what it was, and we as the viewers begin to wonder if this is just a man going slowly insane or is there some truth to what he believes.Long before M. Night Shylaman there was this gem of a picture which follows many of the same principles of Shylaman's work. Jacob's Ladder offers up a twist ending also, and it was one of the most haunting conclusions to a film ever. Once you see it you will know why. Jacob's Ladder loses some points though because it did move slowly at times, and was confusing at other times, but if you watch it through to the very end that confusion will fade and you will walk out of the theater still feeling strongly affected by what happened. I can say no more except to say that the music used at the conclusion was just about perfect.",Jacob's Ladder

He starts to see bizarre faceless people on the subway and in passing cars. In his personal life his wife (powerful performance by Elizabeth Pena) begins to change. His friend and doctor are killed. Then he meets a man who tells him of a strange hallucinating drug that was used on the soldiers in Vietnam. It is a completely enveloped nightmare for Jacob and the audience, with the dreamlike visions and hallucinations and distrust of people. His only hope it seems is his buddy, Louis, played by Danny Aiello.

The ending was great, nothing too fancy, but you could see Jaccob finding the end of his spiritual journey and finally spiritually accepting his death in Vietnam, now he can finally move on from wandering around the world and rest in piece. The idea of having these two ladies in his life, one being his former wife and other his current girlfriend was an interesting add-on as well, hence until the end of the movie it kept you thinking - maybe all of the events are only a dream and he really is together with Sarah right now, but in a coma, because of his son's death?

If you like feeling uncomfortable, if you like being freaked out, if you don't mind a seriously creepy and disturbing film, this one is for you. I am not a fan of horror films but I watch one occasionally. This one reminded me of the creepiness in ""The Believers"" with Martin Sheen. Can a film be too realistic? I think so and the criteria is the level of disturbance it creates. Did it cause you to have nightmares? Did you feel overwhelmed by the film? If so, I think it went too far. Such a film was ""Murder One"" with Henry Thomas. ""In Cold Blood"" came very close. I realize there are many folks who enjoy this type of film. I will say that Tim Robbins was very good in ""Jacob's Ladder"" as was the rest of the cast. The blood, gore and demons were very effective and the film was as nightmarish as is possible on film.

99,lagriff05,Surrealism and horror - this movie just works.,9,26 August 2009,"Jacob's Ladder is one hell of a movie. Very dark, very creepy - seriously, this movie is scarier than most real horror movies, and it doesn't even solely belong to the genre - and very cryptic. What it does right is downplaying the creepy hallucinogenic moments and ghostly specters to where they're not shoved in your face, and to where you'll miss them if you don't pay attention. This gave the movie a very dreamlike and surreal feeling that I haven't seen duplicated by most other horror/suspense movies - which this movie's uplifting ending and overall message sets it apart from.There are a lot of scenes where I even felt like turning this off if I didn't already know how good it was. It's a very disturbing and dark movie where everything that can possibly go wrong, does, and everything that can possibly make sense never happens until the very end. Special points go to the hospital scene for being one of the creepiest and most disturbingly gleeful that I've ever seen. This takes pleasure in making sure you are as uncomfortable as possible and that you never forget it, and it is brilliant.Regarding the ending, well...I don't like twist endings that much anymore. Too often they're flashy and gimmicky and don't really add much to the cinematic experience, and it really takes a good director to do it right. Jacob's Ladder is one of the ones that does it right, because your enjoyment of the movie does not in any way hinge on the twist or the ending. Yes, the twist is pretty drastic, but it's not shoved in your face and you don't feel talked down to when you finally see it. It's quite well written, and I'd cite this movie as an example of how to make a twist ending and a great movie overall.Good stuff.",Jacob's Ladder
100,richspenc,Very intense and powerful along with things which can be believed,8,26 June 2017,"DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ 。 ANY SPOILERS""Jacob's ladder"" is very powerful, intriguing, and dramatic. It really makes you think. Jacob is in Vietnam sitting at his camp.with rest of his platoon just shooting the s***. Suddenly the camp is seemingly invaded by enemy platoon. Everyone flips out all crazy like I never even seen before, one guy seizuring out on his back, several guys with limbs graphicly severed off. Jacob runs off into the jungle and is brutully.stabbed by what seemingly then was an enemy soldier. This is where the very eerie, ullusionary visions and hallucinations begin on screen for the audience. Seemingly, we are then flash forwarded in time to after the war where Jacob is no longer with his wife and kids as he was before the war. He's living with a girl from his post office job, Jezzie (Elizabeth Pina). He keeps getting flashbacks (frightening ones) from the war, and (pleasant ones) from his marriage and his kids including his deceased son Mackuely Culkan, who was run over by a truck while on his bike right before going to Vietnam. He starts getting very weird, spooky visions of demons, the devil, monsters, and speedy shaky heads. It was freaky. He had a real friend though in his chiropracter, Danny Ialo who was very understanding through his experiences. Jacob learned about ""the ladder"", an unusually intense hallucinary weed he and his platoon smoked in Vietnam, and he believed what was happening was he was still.suffering long term effects from it even years later. SPOILERS Things, we find out, can turn out to be nothing like they seem. Here is my analysis of the picture for those who have seen the film all the way through. Jacob never survived past Vietnam. First, it turned out that Jacob was stabbed by a member of his own platoon, and there was no enemy troup, they all psyched out on each other due the unusual weed's effect. When Jacob got stabbed in the jungle, he died slowly, and painfully, with serious emotional, mental, and physical pain. Everything we see after the start of the movie when he gets stabbed in all products of Jacob's awareness. It is a combination of his past memories (his past marriage and being with his sons including the deceased one), his ""what could've happened"" future if he made the wrong choices (everything with life with Jezzie, , his seeing his old friends and lawyer about what Vietnam did to them, and seeing the chemical scientist about ""the ladder"" experiment), his ""what could've happened"" future if he made the right choices (being back with his wife and 2 surviving sons, such as the hospital bed scene right before hearing the spooky ""dream on"" voice), and Jacob's nightmares and fears (the ""dream on"" voice, the spooky staring woman and creature under the blanket on the subway, all the demons, creatures, and fast shaking heads shown throughout the film, the almost getting run over, almost getting blown up, the freaky ride through the weird gruesome images on the hospital guerny, the back room with the man who tells him he's dead and then drills into his head (which is where it's revealed that Jezzie was on the devil's side, why else was she with them there)). Every bit of all of these experiences were all mixed together in one big pot of stew, which were in the moments between Jacob getting stabbed and him finally passing away, when he reunites with his deceased son at the foot of the stairs and ascends with him up to heaven. I believe in the afterlife. I believe that everything that happened in this film is the picture of Danny Ialo explaining ""When you are scared of dying, and you are holding on, you will see demons tearing your life away, but once you have made your peace, the demons are really angels freeing you from the earth"". I love that, and it is very true. That was Jacob's journey from his life to the afterlife. Danny was in a sense his guardian angel. It is sad how there are a few people wanting to now say this movie now works on the ""no afterlife"" thinking and everything in the movie was all in Jacob's head before fading into nothingness. I've seen the program where the directors and producers are talking about the making of the film, they were all saying that Jacob going to heaven were their implications and intentions while creating the story. Danny's philosophy no longer makes so much sense with that no afterlife thinking, angels do not free you from the earth and into nothingness. Some people, such as a few of these reviewers, want to now twist already made ideas into their own terms to fit their own skeptical beliefs. This new no afterlife thinking today is a product of the new skeptical, distrusting, superficial, spiritless society forming in 2010s America.",Jacob's Ladder
101,quinimdb,Jacob's Ladder,7,16 April 2016,"""Jacob's Ladder"" is a very scary, surreal, and confusing film, and it's told entirely from the point of view of Jacob Singer, a man suffering from PTSD who begins to believe he's being pulled into hell by demons.Or at least it is for most of the film. Since the film is told from the perspective of Jacob, you're along for the ride with him for all of the film. When Jacob is scared and confused, so are we, and throughout the film we don't know exactly what's real and whats in Jacob's mind - and neither does he. Is this is when the film is at its best. When ""Jacob's Ladder"" is at its best, it's surreal and terrifying and absolutely bizarre. For most of the film, the events were very ambiguous and what was reality and fiction - and what exactly was happening - was entirely up to the viewer. However, towards the end, the film gets less and less ambiguous, until literally all knots are perfectly tied up in the end. There are moments toward the end where things that are better left unexplained are literally directly explained to the viewer. They don't even try to suggest it, or leave hints to it in the film to be discovered in multiple viewings. Remember the scene in Psycho where the completely random man comes in in the second to last scene just to explain something that we could've figured out ourselves? This film practically does that for pretty much every mystery in the film, one in particular, and in this case it's even worse. I'm not saying every film needs to remain ambiguous, but this one in particular would've been so much more interesting if it was, because there could've been so many different interpretations of it, and for most of the film it was that way, which is why it's so baffling that they decided tie up all the knots towards the end.",Jacob's Ladder
102,toqtaqiya2,One of the most important horror films in cinema.,6,6 August 2012,"Jacob's Ladder is an innovative horror film by English director Adrian Lyne, one of the most successful filmmakers of the 80s. Tim Robbins impressively plays Jacob Singer, a Vietnam War veteran who seems to be ""going to hell"". Interestingly this is happening to him in a New York City that's not far from reality. The city's scenery was intentionally filmed to look medieval. Some scenes were influenced by medieval paintings. Meister Eckhart, the Christian mystic mentioned by Louis, lived in the Middle Ages. Scenes, some very unusual, come and go and the viewer may not understand what is happening on first viewing. This is not a straightforward film, but what makes it especially compelling is Lyne's direction together with Jeffrey L. Kimball's cinematography. Almost every scene is memorable, and there are some unforgettable images. People nowadays seem to forget that memorable images is what cinema is all about. Jacob's Ladder certainly delivers on this front. The supporting cast do a good job, with Danny Aiello as Louis being the standout. I mentioned that this is a horror film but one can also call it a psychological thriller. It's a film with an 80s look and an effective soundtrack. It's not perfect but it's one of my favorites to watch. I easily recommend seeing Jacob's Ladder.",Jacob's Ladder

Good acting from our hero
Horror scenes were unsettling, especially the hospital
Ripe with symbolism, every scene has references to either war, family or the BibleCons:
Can get a little tough to follow, three stories being told at once
Nothing is really learned at the end, the moral of just accepting death isn't too much to mull over, even if it serves as the backdrop of an interesting storyBest part: the girlfriend burning the pictures, small action that holds more context later in the movie, but they didn't feel the need to call back to it visually, I appreciate the subtlety

109,jon_pratt12345,Dreamlike paranoia,8,1 August 2021,Jacob's Ladder is brilliant at creating a dreamlike setting without relying on excessive surrealism.

110,tiskec,One HELL of a Nightmare!,8,12 November 2016,"This movie is outstanding. It's scary in your creepy, thriller, and psychosis kind of way. However, this movie is also scary in the fact that it reveals that government secrets do exist. They're not just a bunch of jive. In the movie, the main character Jacob is shown in early Vietnam, wounded and winding down to unconsciousness. He eventually wakes up in the ""post Vietnam War,"" to find out his son and his family are okay. He lives a ""normal"" life as a mailman in New York City. Then, he starts getting these weird visuals, people with tails and foreign body structures. Eventually, they all turn into monsters. Then one day, he wakes up in a bed next to a woman he knew before he met his wife; he's all confused about this. He starts living in two alternate realities, with visions of occurrences that aren't quite clear, or that contain hellish creatures and settings. In one of his realities, he calls all of his Vietnam buddies to see if they're experiencing the same situations he's going through. Lone and behold, they're all experiencing ""it."" They all thought they would think each individual would think they were nuts if they admitted it, but they soon establish that they're not nuts among each other.Jacob soon finds out through his dream that a chemist had been experimenting with a new drug in order to make super soldiers out of the Army. The test was selected of a small platoon in the Vietnam jungle. It worked alright; so good that the whole platoon killed each other afterwords. it filled everyone with super human rage.You think all of this is fiction, but it's not. Everything that happened was of Jacob's self conscience, unwilling to let go of his family. He's actually dying in a Vietnam medical facility, pumped full of this drug. He is actually living in his self conscience. This movie is very creepy. There is a synopsis at the end that verifies the testing of this drug on Vietnam soldiers during the war. It also states that the Pentagon still tries to deny the authorization of this testing/strategy. The Pentagon doesn't want to take any responsibility (hmmm, sound like American politicians to me). I will let the viewer experience what happens in the end. I don't want to spoil too much. This movie is outstanding. At the end, I was just like....""wow."" I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.",Jacob's Ladder
111,jcanettis,An Excellent Movie Full of Symbolisms,10,11 December 2003,"There are some movies that really set a great precedent, and ""Jacob's Ladder"" is a leading example. Long before movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others"" were out, ""Jacob's Ladder"" was one of the first movies to play so artfully with combinations of the natural and the paranormal, the real and the surreal, and most importantly, a movie that manages to bring the viewer completely by surprise in the end, by making everything seen up to that point shown in a different perspective. The film is full of symbolisms, which are capable to be grasped by someone only if he/she sees the movie more than once. It is not a horror movie, yet there are some scenes that can definitely scare you quite much.In brief, it is a GREAT, 10 out 10, THOUGHT-PROVOKING movie, but be prepared for a hard ride when you watch it!And now, let me express my thoughts of how I interpreted it.*** WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD ***I subscribe to the following theory as expressed in several variations by other reviewers in this forum: Jacob gets hit by friendly fire in Vietnam, and his fellow soldiers try to rescue him, yet to no avail in the end. This is the ""real"" part of the film, which ends with the two doctors claiming that ""we lost him"" in the last scene.The ""surreal"" part that is taking part in Jacob's mind (or soul) throughout this period, is that he descends to hell (subway), straggles with demons (Jezzebel, evil doctors, ""Santa Claus"" in the street, security men, etc.), but finally the angels (chiropratic, Sarah, dead son, chemist) show him the way up to heaven. Throughout this process, he is punished for his noughty thoughts (or maybe acts) that he had with Jezzebel when he was married, he is told the truth about what happened to his ""ladder""-drugged battalion (chemist), and he is taught to live with the fact that he has to reconcile with what haunts him and pass away peacefully (chiropractic).It is interesting to note that the film plays with many symbolisms: Biblical names (Jacob, Jezzebel, Sara), hellish subway where everything is locked, stairway to heaven with shining light, Jezzebel burns Sarah's and kids' photos in fire, demons with horns and tails, Jake burns in fever, etc. Moreover, the idea is that only Jake is salvated; his friends try to break free with him, but finally are doomed to stay in hell.I think that the more ones sees the film, the more he/she will find out new things. EXCELLENT!",Jacob's Ladder
112,JeanMoniette,"Genre defining, an absolute must watch.",10,17 August 2020,"Have you heard of a genre called 'brainf__k'? Without Jacob's Ladder, one wonders if there would have been a 'Pi', a 'Memento', or a 'Donnie Darko'. And I'd hazard a guess as far as saying directors such as Lynch or Noe wouldn't have had as much of a cult following if it didn't put a certain trend in the mainstream radar.It redefined the plot twist in way the '6th sense' simply emulated. So many movies 'can be linked to its influence. It has spawned countless remakes including 'Stay' or (the terrible) 'Soul Survivors'. It's the inspiration of countless video games and novels.On the plus side, it's THE genre defining movie to end them all for fans of fantasy/sci-fi anthologies. It's high art, high concept but it's never high brow. It's intelligently constructed without being obtuse. It's well acted without being pompous or award-baiting.Of course, it was made 31 years ago as of 2020, and parts of it didn't age that well. Can it be a bit too 'obvious' for modern audiences? Yes. Could the violence have been done 'better', more 'Two Imas' than 'MASH'? Yes. Could the sound, the VFX, the photography have benefited from 2020 treatment? Absolutely. And is some of it a bit 'ham fisted' in a way only the late 80's could have produced? I'm afraid so.Oh and yes, once you've seen it once, well...Still, a movie should be judged based on what it was at release and now how it aged, and for that Jacob's Ladder gets 10/10.",Jacob's Ladder

The first time when I have seen it there were of course the shock, the surprise, the tension and the awe. Now I was able to study more detached the masterly concept, construction and atmosphere of Jacob's Ladder. Still I don't know what to say and how to put it! OK, let me appear dumb here and just rave about a tremendous film revealing the reality behind reality, about the simple things that appear to be in fact essential things, about the madness and the sheer egotism in war, about dignity and the lack of it, about Louis the overweight angel and about mind creating its own hell and paradise...Everyone should watch this film once.",Jacob's Ladder
114,Martinito_08183,A unique psychological horror movie.,8,1 October 2019,"It has some things that are very unique, but unfortunately there are also some decisions that i wasn't a huge fan or didn't agree with them. The beginning (which takes place in Vietnam) is very weak with it's dialogue, camera work and editing, but when the psychological elements / moments start happening - i was invested into the main character and the story, with some great and very effective disturbing scenes.Many of the aspects are executed very well, but some of them do stumble a lot:
i wasn't a huge fan of the music, since it reuses the same tracks too much and it's something that happens nowadays in many movie soundtracks that i don't like at all;there are characters that are not interesting and at the same time are very unlikable (like Jacob's girlfriend);some of the dialogue is not good;there are some actors that don't give a good performance;the camera work and editing is very weird and absurd in some moments;Overall the movie succeeds and when it succeeds - it's very intriguing and emotional, but there are also some things that you can't take very seriously.I can see why the movie is a huge source of inspiration for many people, since Jacob's Ladder served as a huge inspiration for Silent Hill, which is my favorite survival horror franchise to date, so i'm very grateful to the movie for that.If you love horror movies, especially psychological - then this is a recommendation and there are many things that you will like and admire, but i don't think everyone will count it as a timeless masterpiece or a classic - including myself.",Jacob's Ladder
115,jonathandoe_se7en,"One of the best Horror films, ever!!!",9,7 August 2001,"The only disappointment in Jacob's Ladder, is the fact that it shows just what a talented director Adrian Lyne really is, yet he throws his talent away on such popcorn based romps like Fatal Attraction and 9 and Half Weeks. After the riveting opening deep in the Vietnam jungles we are introduced to Jacob Singer (a never better Tim Robbins), a New York postal worker troubled by dangerous and disturbing visions, visions that could be linked to his tour in Vietnam, or something much more sinister. Most people hate this film because of the punishment that Jacob takes in the film, everyone is out to get him, his only true trustworthy companion is Luis (Danny Aielo, sp), his chiropractor, who is often on hand to give Jacob cryptic information. But the film really belongs to Lyne, he really has a handle on the subject matter, this may have been his least successful film but this is the film people will be talking about years after his retirement. He shoots 70's New York as a dark hellhole, filled with freaks and demons. Bruce Joel Rubin should also be applauded for his script, even though some of the twists are quite obvious he leaves so much open to interpretation.Tim Robbins is one of my all time favourite actors and in this film he really nails the paranoia and fear that Jacob is forced to go through if he wants to achieve his redemption. Like I said, so much is left to interpretation that one person could watch the film, and have a completely different idea than someone else who watched it at the same time, there are so many elements at play, good and evil, heaven and hell... It's hard to understand why this film hasn't achieved more of a cult following, it's still has to be one of the most underrated film of all time... I would recommend it to anyone, but at the end of the day I love the film, so no-one else matters...9/10",Jacob's Ladder
116,richkiel,Unforgettable,8,16 August 2021,"No spoilers here, though the story will be discussed in a general way that will not reveal any important information.You WILL remember this film. It is truly terrifying and nerve-wrecking. The tension is relentless and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. And the creepy mood engulfs you, dragging you into the terror the protagonist is experiencing. The opening scene introduces the backstory, and then the famous subway scene follows. That scene will scare you, and you will want to know what happens next. The film is a truly scary ride, like a rollercoaster of dread and terror, with surprise twists and turns.And then, just as it gets really good, the screenwriter seems to lose inspiration, and it all ends with a rather dull explanation and an ending that not only makes virtually no sense, but is not emotionally satisfying. When the entire film up until the third act promises an end worth waiting for, it's a real shame to end the film the way they did. Also, I think the plot is a bit too convoluted, and the confusion it creates detracts from the terror. When the audience is asking questions all the time, it can't remain focused on the scary things. But that is a minor complaint, and I am sure many people actually like these confusing moments. But the ending is totally uninspired, and frankly, I felt nothing. Well, I felt slightly cheated for investing so much in the film emotionally, without a real payoff.Other than that, the casting and acting is great. Direction is solid. Cinematography is just what it needs to be for a film like that. The film came out in 1990, but really feels like an 80s film. Those of you who like the 80s will enjoy it.All in all, I like this film, and I wish I could give it ten stars. 90% of it is flawless. But the end spoils it for me.",Jacob's Ladder
117,sc8031,Strong performances and excellent atmosphere held back only by a somewhat ambivalent ending,8,6 August 2008,"Here's a borderline-surrealist horror film with religious and polemic military undertones regarding Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the treatment of psychologically unhealthy veterans.Jacob Singer (played well by Tim Robbins) has sustained subtle psychological damage during a combat tour in the Vietnam War. Years later he is living in New York City, employed as a Postal Worker (despite having a Ph.D) and abiding a contented existence with his girlfriend, when he begins to see strange creatures inhabiting his surroundings. The disturbances take their toll on his mental health and begin to create problems in his love and social lives. Soon he is haunted by his dead son, conspiracy theories and terrifying trans-dimensional trips. Jacob segues in and out of waking reality, trying to come to grips with what happened back in the war.The actors in the film all do a good job and the pacing of the film is solid too. Jason Alexander and the guys playing Jacob's combat platoon are pretty good, so it's too bad we don't see more of them. I found the music to be surprisingly affecting and haunting, which was a pleasant surprise. It was not one-dimensional either, providing a certain amount of variety appropriate to the scenes. Despite the borderline ""horror"" element of the movie, it has a decent share of uplifting moments too. It is not a completely bleak ""gorefest"", though it may not be entirely heart-warming either. The biblical references were a bit hokey for me, but they do provide thematic resonance with the story by the end.Perhaps the significant shortcoming of ""Jacob's Ladder"" is the non-concrete ending, which feels more like an easy way out for the film-makers than something open to the audience's interpretation (though it is presented that way). The script was apparently written by the same guy who did ""Ghost"", though this is the better film of the two. Similar motifs appear here as in Ghost: demons whisking people to hell, life after death, true love. It's also amusing that of these two films written by Bruce Joel Rubin, the director Adriane Lyne directed ""Jacob's Ladder"", considering he works primarily on romantic thrillers.""Jacob's Ladder"" is definitely worth a look for anyone interested in cinematic pop-surrealism, psychological and ethereal horror, suspense, military trauma or bittersweet love. It's a genuinely inspired movie with fine performances from the cast, but it will not sit well with viewers looking for a concise ending wrapped up in a neat package. I had no trouble concluding the story, but I wonder if my own conclusions were the same as the directors.7.5",Jacob's Ladder
118,starlit-sky,Jacob's Ladders Is One Of A Kind,10,4 January 2000,"Jacob's Ladder is a psychological thriller in which Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins), a Vietnam veteran, is suffering from hallucinations which seem to have some connection with what happened to him one night in Vietnam war. Jacob finds himself living in different time realities and he just cannot grab at the present time. He sees demons and nightmarish visions strangely combined with flashbacks of that night in Vietnam which make him pass out. When he regains conciousness, he wakes up to completely a different time reality which, too, turns out to be a false at the end, leading him to another false reality. He cannot make sense of the situation and thinks he is losing his mind. He constantly finds himself trapped in neverending sequences of nightmares that he cannot wake up from. This cycle never ends until the end of the film when all the other realities vanish, leaving out only one reality which makes Jacob's Ladder a brilliant movie. Jacob's physician Louis probably express the main theme of the movie best in these words: ""So, if you're frightened of dying and... and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth.""I think this movie is unfairly underestimated and not given enough credit. Tim Robbins' performance is flawless and fascinating. Adrian Lyne directed the movie very well; the emotions and the tension that are aimed to be brought about are achieved quite successfully. One interesting fact about the movie is that when you watch it for the second time, you notice a lot of things, which you did not notice or could not make sense out of in the first place. Names, small incidents, conversations, even the advertisement in the downtown train take on a new meaning once you know what is really happening to Jacob's Singer. I strongly recommend Jacob's Ladder to the people who like psychological thrillers and soft horror movies.",Jacob's Ladder

And he wasn't wrong although this film is harrowing and disturbing it's also very touching and beautiful in it's own small way.The whole film was about Jacob Singer (brilliantly played by Tim Robbins)and the things he see's every day; like being told he's dead seeing his girlfriend dance with a monster and seeing hobo's with tails.This film keeps you entertained till the very end with a dramatic twist and a very interesting scene were Jacob see's hell.

This one started the decade right, and by the end of the 20th Century, we were witness to others like it; ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Others,"" et al.   Jacob Ladder--already pointed out by one savvy critic--is very loosely based on Ambrose Bierce's short horror story, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.""  Both 'Ladder and 'Bridge are about a soldier (former the US Army, latter Civil War) who undergoes an extraordinary journey back home. To say anything more would be criminal.  I will address one other point: 'Ladder seemed to have started a trend in subsequent horrors by featuring a scene in which a malevolent creature (usually some type of ghost) is shown having some type of epileptic seizure.  The other films to use this effect include the remake of ""House on Haunted Hill.""  With horror films being what they are (then or now), it is often difficult to scare audiences.

121,Sanou_san,The creepy trick layers the dramatic tone of this film,9,28 June 2012,"This gave me a man crush on Tim Robbins after seeing him acted so well. And all this time around I was thinking ""Where did I saw Elizabeth Pena before?"" and ""oh, alright that's here, that's got to be her? No way!?"" I never heard of this film ever but browsing here in IMDb gave me chances to catch a glimpse of never before seen films that got so much of beauty of its area. This is the first film of Tim Robbins I saw, and the much classic and acclaimed ""Shawshank Redemption"" has to be him! There are still so much films in line in my list for this man (e.g. Shawshank Redemption, Mystic River, The Arlington Road, The Player, Hudsucker Proxy, The Secret Life of Words and more).Many would say the story of Jacob's Ladder is rather predictable or maybe I'm just new to this area that I didn't grasp what the film truly meant. It was a horror film in the first place, but it was more of a drama side actually. Its quiet terrifying how much of an ordeal one has to go through before accepting death. It's sensible but disturbing. Jacob's horrifying experience had to be a realization, a fight disguised in hideous recollections, repeatedly telling him to let go, make peace of you and accept death. There so much punishment he experienced only to think that everything was for his good. I'm quiet confused why Gabe is uncredited in this film but nevertheless he's the character that waited for Jacob's redemption and peace sit in. This film dramatic side gives me the chills, appreciating the beauty of the character's experiences. But I would not deny the creepy side. That hospital scene could indeed make anyone sick more than ever. The demons were really disturbing, the atmosphere was eerie and I wish I could see the deleted scenes to emphasize more what I missed. But the current release is fine, it holds true to its intentions and I would recommend this to anyone.",Jacob's Ladder
122,MWNiese,"Some Good Scares, But........",7,29 March 2008,"Tim Robbins is a Vietnam Vet living in New York City who starts to experience war flash-backs, violent hallucinations, and horrific dreams. The plot centers around Jacob (Robbins) trying to explain the demonic occurrences starting to consume his life. This is a very well done film but it does have some continuity problems. Before the negative stuff though, let's talk about the positive stuff. There's a solid cast of great actors assembled here, and they all turn in quality performances. The directing, special effects, cinematography, sound, and editing are wonderful. There are more than a few originally done jump scares and the whole film is dark and creepy.I do think that the script and screenplay drag at times. There are also some continuity issues that are glaring deficiencies in my mind. For instance, what is the exact time period of this film? It was released in 1990, but looks like the early eighties, and has a plot that places it in the late seventies?? I just think there is too much plot material left out, which is left up to the audience to figure out. That's fine if the audience needs to figure out a few things, but come on..... I don't want to spoil it for people, so I'll just advise first time viewers to be ready to fill in many blanks.Like I said, this is an excellent movie. It has many more positive attributes than negative ones. I do recommend that any serious horror fan view this film at least once.

123,gentendo,Devilishly Impressive,10,12 September 2009,"Adrian Lyne's, Jacob's Ladder, is the freakishly twisted tale of Vietnam war vet, Jacob Singer, who, after being ambushed in Viet Cong by an agent orange assault, returns to his home town in New York City only to suffer from extreme post-traumatic hallucinations. The hallucinations become increasingly bizarre as Jacob struggles to overcome the painful memories of his son (played by Macaulay Culkin) who was killed while he was in the war.Lyne uses seemingly ordinary images to evoke the fear and sickness that Jacob suffers with, from vapid shower curtains and naked spines, to the grotesque slab of meat inside a refrigerator—all induce a sense of estrangement and insanity. Later he uses more horror-styled elements: coiled reptilian tails, saber-tooth's, convulsing heads built on paint bucket shakers, etc.The nonlinear style cuts back and forth between Jacob's present life in NY and his former life in Viet Cong. At times, flashes of a later life (i.e. an afterlife) appear on screen that seem to foreshadow his inevitable fate. Jacob begins to see literal demons infiltrate his perceptual awareness, haunting and tearing at his soul, causing him to sink lower and lower into the depths of madness as he struggles to let go of his memories and embrace death. But are these demons real, or are they simply figments of his hallucinatory imagination? Along the way, he shares multiple conversations with his guardian angel chiropractor, Louis (Danny Aiello), who imparts very peculiar, almost preachy wisdom to Jacob to help him calm his hellish nightmares. Quoting from Meister Eckhart (the master of Negative Theology), he says: ""Eckhart saw Hell too; he said: 'the only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you,' he said. 'They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth.'"" Most of the time, the viewer is unaware of where the story is headed. It's like an LSD trip gone seriously wrong and without that backup friend to soothe or provide remedy. It's also somewhat reminiscent of C.S. Lewis' ""Screwtape Letters,"" very self-aware of the macabre and forces you to ponder uncomfortable subjects. The film is one of my favorites, as it merges the gap between the two worlds we exist in—the dark one and the light one—not to forget exposes the two voices that exist inside us all—the devilish one and the angelic one.

It brings up some good subjects, jumps a lot back and forward from dreams and reality, and i guess somewhere in between i got lost a tad, and in the end i was rather confused, when i had just seen the movie i thought something like ""f*** i didn't get the end 100%"", and that actually made me want to rate it worse than i did here, but when i think back at it, the movie was actually quite enjoyable and it kept me to my seat all the way through, so even though i found some parts confusing and unexplained i still think it was a well made psychological thriller, i should see it again to be honest, because i think the pieces would fall easier in place the second time you see it.8/10",Jacob's Ladder

The manner in which the plot unfolds in small pieces which keep the viewer just as confused and in the dark as the protagonist is, is wonderfully confusing and interesting, as nothing is obvious or boring. A so-called ""rubber reality"" in which the main character is completely unaware that they are perceiving reality differently than it truly is, this film creates a constant and unadulterated mood of confusion and bewilderment, as protagonist Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) struggles to deal with his PTSD induced hallucinations. In a sense, this is a horror film, though the danger is not real. Jacob is creating his own house of hours, as his brain throws visions of battle and past danger in his now mundane life, and as an intimate and involved viewer (with this film it is almost impossible to feel removed) one is included in the feelings of terror and confusion.

The editing was effective and fitting for the horror genre and may have been what inspired the show Supernatural. Unfortunately, I do not do well with this type of horror editing and will not watch this movie again. The point of the film was great and I love that it is a movie based on real events. I love the awareness that these films can generate generations after their release. The perspective of the film was from a Vietnam veteran who was experiencing a wild form of drug induced PTSD. The pacing of the film felt like a good film pacing should be. It would be slow in parts and then faster in others. This pacing makes a film feel alive and as though it was breathing. It keeps the viewer engaged and I think this is one of the more complex parts of story writing and editing. The payoff of the film came at the very end when we learned the truth about what happened to the veteran. It was satisfying to realize that this is where the filmmaker brought the truth of the film into existence. I do like a lot about the film and it reflects a story that I want to write (minus the creepy supernatural stuff). It was a sad film, but I do like that it did the job of telling the story without pounding your emotions like some films try to do. Good film, but be warned it is supernatural/horror.",Jacob's Ladder
128,shadow_blade-89459,Worth the trip back in time,9,13 April 2018,"""Jacobs Ladder"" (1990) is a dramatic horror mystery told from the perspective of a Vietnam veteran named Jacob Singer, played by Tim Robbins, as he tries to navigate his life through the physical representation of his inner demons. This film is freakishly well put together and keeps the viewer guessing how it will conclude through all of Jacob's dissociation. He lives with his girlfriend Jezzie, played by Elizabeth Peña, who tries to help him cope with life and the loss of his son Gabe, played by Macaulay Culkin. This film practices the art of multi-story sequencing in that Jacob has several stories within his main story which I truly appreciate. It forces the viewer to pay attention so as not to miss pertinent information.For a film made in the early 90s, Adrian Lyne did a marvelous job with the pacing. Still there were some areas that dragged on or could have been omitted all together. However, I feel back then the audience needed those moments for the emotional connection to Jacob. The point of this film can be taken in more than one way, but the strongest of those is shedding light on what the U.S. government did to their own soldiers. Though the payoff was very expected, due to the trailer, it was still sadly fulfilling. This film was on my bucket list for a long time and now having viewed it, I am happy I did.

Burroughs ... it is non-linear yet tells the story of Jacob Singer, Vietnam vet, postman, chiropractic patient ... he can't quite recall however what happened in the last day or days of his tour in Vietnam and things start to come unraveled when he sees 'fast-moving-head-people' appearing here and there ... as we are transported back and forth and perhaps even beyond the movie's scope of his life, we become disoriented along with him, wondering where things are fitting into the puzzle ... he finds ultimately that his unit in Vietnam was given a drug called 'the ladder' which the army experimented with to increase the fighting rampage and desire of the troops (remember that this was a constant gripe among generals etc during the Vietnam era ... of course, blaming the 'grunt' is a long standing tradition and it was the lies of the top leaders that were the ultimate failure in Vietnam, not any lack of fighting desire by the troops)-- the ladder, as explained by the chemist who was blackmailed into making it, takes one 'right down the ladder, to the base hate' ... it doesn't quite work very well ... but hearing the chemist explain the 'test' of the drug he witnessed will haunt you ...ultimately, what do we find? well I'll leave that for you to watch ... but the disturbing nature of the movie is amazingly deep and moving as the filmmaker is not going for the typical Vietnam story nor the typical scary movie story but it is beyond that, beyond life, as Jacob tries to sort out everything at once it seems ...Danny Aiello is wonderful as the chiropractor who is show hovering over Jacob making adjustments ... the rest of the cast is outstanding as the ensemble comes together magnificently ...Tim Robbins is the star tho and he is perfect ... his boyish shy smile and frightened bewilderment mix and wax and wane through the film in perfect waves of emotion that touch and chill your heart at the same time ...still an amazing film these 20 years later ... i don't watch it often as it usually causes me to sit up all night thinking ... the fast-moving-head-people are enough to freak anyone out not to mention a trip down the basement hallway of a hospital ... let alone the dance scene ...",Jacob's Ladder
131,Mr_Mirage,Presented for your consideration...,10,2 January 2004,"This film is a wonder, a film that refuses to be a simple straight forward telling of a tale and prefers to remain instead an enigma, a mystery.THIS IS NOT A SPOILER, just an able assist for those who are befuddled by it... Notice if you will that at the very beginning of the film, a place and date appear on the screen. Notice further that you will never see another place or date on the screen throughout the film.A superb exercise in the realm of personal reality, Tim Robbins' performance is outstanding. Not for the weak of heart, disturbing in its depiction of an external reality as experienced by the main character...",Jacob's Ladder
132,ShaeSpencer,Brilliant.,9,18 August 2020,"Brilliantly put together. For me, the best ""horror"" films (in quotes because this is not so easily categorized) are the ones that effortlessly suck you into the existential nightmare of a character's crumbling sanity. The authenticity and naturalism of Tim Robbins' performance, the unsettling, eerily beautiful music, the darkly lush imagery, and the masterfully artful editing make Jacob's waking (?) horror and despair painfully real. But a blissful undercurrent of love and warmth breaks through in moments between lovers, friends, and family which washes over and salves the deep wounds the film inflicts.",Jacob's Ladder
133,Brakathor,Not all it's cracked up to be,5,2 July 2021,"This film, while promising in the plot's development, in the end comes out as a bit of a hodgepodge, because it's based on top/down logic. Basically it's about a guy who's on his deathbed, and most of the film centers around an elaborate dream he's having as he's dying. What makes me feel so cheated by the ending is that in the dream there's this whole unraveling of a plot that's supposed to be centered around not just his wartime experiences, but what led to his death.The problem is, it's ALL a dream! Therefore, you can't tie in a SINGLE thing explained in the dream to what's actually happening to him. The government testing drugs on its soldiers, well THAT'S neither here nor there, because the big reveal by the guy who developed the drug, he's just a dream character, i.e. A figment of Tim Robbin's imagination, so in the end, it's JUST about a guy dying from a stab wound, and the whole drug premise is completely illusory. I find overall, ""mystery"" films as a genre, films for people who absolutely LOVE twist endings, are basically for people with the sensibilities of a goldfish. You'll accept ANY twist that comes your way, because you literally can't remember the first half of the film, which COMPLETELY conflicts with the final analysis, and this film is no different in that regard.",Jacob's Ladder
134,bhicks56,One of the scariest movies I have ever seen,10,18 November 1999,"Whoa mama. What a brain-warper. I don't know if you can categorize this movie. Is it an edgy drama? A psychological thriller? A trippy horror flick? A religious film? A government conspiracy film? The rubic's cube structure and baffling ending always leaves me with both an exclamation point and a question mark. But Adrian Lyne's underrated classic has is a kicky ride with a groundbreaking visual style that has been borrowed in lesser films, most recently the new ""House on Haunted Hill"".",Jacob's Ladder
135,Speechless,Almost great,8,12 February 2002,"Hmm.  I'm kind of ambivalent about Jacob's Ladder.  On one hand, the movie creates a great sensation of paranoia and fear, particularly in the unforgettable ""hospital gurney"" sequence (must-see viewing for fans of Silent Hill).  Director Adrian Lyne should do another horror movie, because here he demonstrates an incredible flair for atmosphere and nightmarish imagery.  Good cinematography, a haunting score, and nuanced performances by Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Pena don't hurt either.  But there's a huge subplot, relating to the government conspiracy and cover-up of what really happened to Jacob and his platoon in Vietnam, that doesn't lead anywhere.  A huge portion of the movie is devoted to Jacob investigating the conspiracy, culminating in a very long conversation scene with a chemist who seems to hold the answer.  This entire story thread becomes more or less meaningless at the end, when everything is explained in a way that has nothing to do with a cover-up.  It's like there's an entirely different movie trying to take over.  They should have jettisoned the conspiracy plot, or even made it into a completely separate movie. 
Too bad, because otherwise Jacob's Ladder works really well.  It could have been a really great film, one of those rare horror movies that help us define what it means to be human.  As it stands, it's worth seeing once or twice.",Jacob's Ladder

138,Sam_Gray,a good film that is almost irredeemably damaged by a stupid plot element,8,13 February 2000,"While the premise for Jacob's Ladder is brilliant, it's a shame that screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin couldn't resist trying to insert a social statement into a plot that is otherwise based totally in spiritual and philosophical matters.  To be more specific (but without using a spoiler), Jacob's epiphany about what really happens to him in Vietnam is stupid; it's unreasonable to think he could possibly arrive at this conclusion.  And what's worse, the addition of this plot element totally deconstructs an otherwise perfect allegory.  It's unnecessary and it's presence is a crying shame.But, nevertheless, I do like the movie.  What it does, it does well.  Some legitimate scares and a general creepy atmosphere benefit the film, as does the performance of Tim Robbins.  Furthermore, the juxtaposition between Jacob's life in New York and his experience in Vietnam is handled well - as are the biblical references.  But, be warned.  This is the kind of movie you have to watch twice to catch all the subtleties.  8/10",Jacob's Ladder
139,spenrh,Intense film but very memorable,9,2 February 2021,"Very good, powerful, and unforgettable film. It's best of course the first time watching it when you truly don't know what'll happen next. And I even felt the same seeing it again for the first time in years, since I'd forgotten some of the film by then. However, I still enjoy watching it because it's one heck of a ride even when you know what's coming.The film starts with Jacob in Vietnam, where some crazy things start happening to members of his platoon. Jake is brutally stabbed, but then we see him wake up on a NY subway. I'm sure that many first time viewers (me as well) thought that Jake being in Vietnam and getting stabbed was just a bad dream he had while falling asleep on the subway.But spooky things begin to happen to Jake in NY, starting with a creepy looking woman staring at him and someone/something sleeping under a blanket with a strange looking tail hanging out. These are only the beginning of Jake's nightmare visions he sees which only keep getting worse, eventually leading to fast vibrating heads, razor-tooth birds, and more creatures with long tails, including one dancing with Jesse (Elizabeth Pena), Jake's then girlfriend, at a party.Jake and his ex-platoon members realize that they're all suffering from the same delusions, and that something connected with them and the army has happened. Jake almost gets run over, his Vietnam war buddy Paul is blown up in a car explosion (who also saw frightening visions), and after he and his platoon goes to a lawyer (Sienfeld's Jason Alexander) about the suspected drugs the army may've slipped them through experimentation, army thugs grab him into a car and threaten his life if he talks to anyone else about suspected army experiments. His buddies also back out of going to the lawyer but won't be clear with him why, and they tell Jake not to bother them about it again. You can figure out that it's because those same thugs went to all of them also threatening them too not to talk anymore (even though we didn't see that. But we can see hands on a steering wheel when the whole group of them walk out of the building where they spoke to the lawyer).What makes this film so fascinating the first times seeing it is you really don't know which is Jake's dreams or realities. We see him in Vietnam, we see him living with Jesse and working for the post office, and then we see him waking up with his (ex?)wife Sarah and his sons where he mentions that living with Jesse was all a dream, so we're led to temporarily believe that none of the scenes with Jesse really happened. However, the movie continues to throw us around on what's real or not. When we see Jake living with Jesse, we see what appears to be Jake getting flashbacks from when he was stabbed in Vietnam, leading us to temporarily think how that's the real scenerio. We also see a very poignant scene of Jake reviving in the bathtub next to Jesse after we saw the scenes with him and Sarah and his kids. Jake himself is in shock seemingly because he just found out what he thought was real with Sarah and his kids really wasn't. This was also where Jake previously was running a 106° fever and was thrown in the tub with lots of bags of ice by Jesse and his neighbors. Jesse then reveals to Jake that while he was in the tub he was ""talking to Sarah and his kids, including the dead one"". In this ""reality"" with Jesse, one of his sons (played by Maculy Culkin) was killed in an accident before he went to Vietnam.SPOILERS BELOWShifting through his different ""realities"", Jake has seemingly found a soulmate/guardian angel through his chiropractor Danny Iallo, who offers him more momentary solace than most anyone else he encounters (next to Sarah and his kids). Danny's advice to Jake is beautiful, and in a sense sums up the main plot: ""When you're scared of dying, you'll see demons tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, the demons are really angels freeing your soul"". Basically that's what's happening to Jake throughout the movie. All of Jake's ""realities"" are experiences going through his mind and soul while his body is dying from his stab wound in Vietnam. Vietnam was basically his only actual reality. The rest of Jake's experiences throughout the movie were memories of his life with his ex Sarah and kids including his deceased kid, his various future possibilities if he'd survived past Vietnam (some which entailed Jesse), and the rest of his experiences were visions of the frightning demons which were really to be angels if Jake would just make his peace. And, Jake eventually does and reconciles his deceased son (since it becomes revealed that his son dying really happened and wasn't just in his future vision with Jesse).In the last segment of the movie, Jake is ""taken home"" in a taxi. We see him walk into his home where he lived with Sarah and his sons, we see leftover food on the table and all of the other things he always saw at his home, but no one was there except him and his deceased son at the foot of a stairway he then ascended up with. I wasn't clear why this was at first, but this is what I figured: Jake wasn't really at his home, he was at a domain which represented his home and his memory of it, a special domain between his life and heaven. Sarah and his other two sons weren't there because they were still alive, back on earth. Only Jake and his son were there because they were the only ones who've now crossed over. Jake was now passed on and meeting with his deceased son, and they both together ascended up to heaven.",Jacob's Ladder

Now, having seen it with better 'movie' eyes, I have to say that few films can deliver what Jacob's Ladder delivers. A phenomenal script side by side with a talented cast that keeps you mesmerized for its entirety.  Furthermore, if you have the chance; see the deleted scenes on the DVD (and laserdisc?).  There is one that stands out. Near the end, a scene was deleted.  It is absolute poetry and, frankly, I can't believe it was left out.

It's also a very sorrowful movie because Jacob's journey is mostly a painful one.

143,blackasp98,Jacobs nightmares,10,27 August 2006,"This film was by the most disturbing i have seen during the nineties.The films premise is basic but enthralling,a Vietnam soldier who is wounded during battle evisions the demons in his life,but translated as not flashbacks,but his life flashing before his eyes.Looking ahead after the death of his son by an accident,the mixtures of dreams and flashes starts to echo in his memories.Which starts a chain reaction of visions so horrible that he thinks hes going insane.This story has some merit about scientific experiments done by their own government using a chemical agent which causes agressiveness in the soldiers,hoping for quick results by rampaging through Vietnam as the ultimate killer suddenly has a turn for the worst.Each soldier starts killing each other,with no remorse or mercy.But in jacobs case,he wasn't succumbed to the chemical as the others were,in fact it somehow altered his perception on his surroundings of the subconscious.Giving him frightening visions of demons and what if scenarios during his demise on the gurny in nams mash unit.I thought it was a great film,the creepy creatures with no feeling of human essence,driving him insane with faceless people.A demon of sadism on a gurny shaking with unholy vibrations and a hood on its head.The presence of evil in every corner of his mind,hoping for a way out of death,only to accept it,as an appease to his sons memory.Knowing he should not have been in Vietnam,but being home for his wife,and son.Excellent film,hats off to adrian lynne.",Jacob's Ladder

This movie is one of the scariest movies of all time, it has been greatly overlooked and everytime someone asks me which is my farorite horror/thriller movie, Jacob, Angel Heart, and the Legend of Hell House come on top (although the later one I have not seen in over 28 years).  This movie has some of the scariest scenes of any movies, not just gore but scary stuff (check out the bouncing head at a party, who came up with this stuff!!!). Elizabeth Pe~na and Tim Robbins are great, Pe~na in particular. I don't agree with some of the people here who say the plot does not make sense. It completely does if you take as a given a certain premise.

He starts seeing weird things , ugly creatures chase him in the subway , and even his dead son (Macaulay Culkin) from his first marriage comes to visit him. Jacob's Vietnam buddies are also having the same symptoms. Together they find out the truth about the horrible experiments that took place in Vietnam. The worst thing about Jacob's nightmares is that he is not dreaming...He realizes that too late...and falls down from his ladder.Now this movie is not really a horror. It's more like a psychological thriller with horror elements (which are used very effectively). Its never boring , though the story is a little hard to follow. Its not your typical brainless horror flick. As the movie goes, it slowly shows Jacob falling into madness and despair. The atmosphere is creepy and even unpleasant at times. But those are one of the factors that make this film a masterpiece.The acting is almost on the highest possible level. Tim Robbins looks great as the paranoiac Jacob. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Pena (Jacob's wife) , Danny Aiello (Jacob's doctor) , Ving Rhames ,Eriq LaSalle (Jacob's Nam buddies) , and even Macaulay Culkin (Jacob's dead son).

156,harsawa,Wow- what a film.,9,1 April 2006,"Since this is an overall summary+review, I'm giving you another heads up, *EXCESSIVE SPOILER WARNING* /SPOILERS I had heard of Jacob's Ladder for years, but only the name. I had only bothered checking it out because I've heard it was the inspiration for one of my favorite games- Silent Hill, and I'm surprised I hadn't seen this draining film (As it fits in one of my favorite genres) It begins with a supposed Vietnam flash back, where out of no where they began to be attacked by a seemingly invisible force (All is explained later) and then it stops, and we see Jacob Singer, a seemingly normal man in his 30's or 40's on a train when he notices something odd about the one other passenger. He then gets off the train only to find the station is barricaded, so he trys to find a new route. He does make it home, but things have been changing. He's been having visions of his tour of Vietnam, and they all seem weird as he does not remember them. Eventually he starts to see more weird things, people, or creatures are hunting him down. He tries to find more information from the army- but the army denies all, even that he was ever in the Vietnam war. He gets a call from an old army buddy, who is freaking out. Saying he's going to hell, that they're coming for him. After the meeting, his car explodes taking his life. Strange things continue to occur up until Jacob is injured. He is then dragged through a seemingly hellish hospital, where they tell him he is dead and experiment. He wakes up to be rushed out by his chiropractor (A seemingly angelic character) who heals his injury and gives Jacob advice. The demons, or whatever you'd like to call them, are not taking him to be tortured in inferno, but if he is to make peace and accept the fact that they are coming for him they are really angels trying to take his soul from the cruel earth. He gets another call, he's found the information he's needed from the army. As everyone knows, the army has been rumored to have experimented with drugs to make ""Super soldiers"", well, this was confirmed by this strange man who has also been following Jacob. He was commissioned during the Vietnam war to create a drug for making super soldiers, The Ladder. The ladder was a dangerous drug- first tested on primapes. They then used it on Jacob's unit, saying that they'd get the highest kill ratio. They did, however, the invisible force from the beginning was their allies. Their kill ration increased, but the ladder made them so violent they began to kill each other, and apparently this drug was the cause of everything Jacob has been seeing. He tries to get in contact with his 2 remaining children and his ex-wife, but cannot find them. He remembers what his doctor told him, and as he is alone with the creatures, accepts his fate. And the demon becomes his dead son, who takes him to heaven. They then have one final twist for the viewers- none of it happened. You see a Vietnam medic camp, and the medics are operating on Jacob, he has just died after the attack seen in the supposed flash backs./SPOILERS END /REVIEWI highly recommend seeing Jacob's Ladder, it's rare you see a film quite like it.

Jacob's Ladder tumbles your mind the same way a dream of your own does. I have never felt this effect in a film so strong before. The images comes pouring in and your brain tries to make sense of it.

The limbo state between heaven and hell.  Jacob is died in Vietnam and he is dead at the beginning of the movie.  He is on a train at the beginning where he reads 'welcome to hell' . Indeed he is on his way to hell.  He is living with 'the devil' in sin who he has sold his soul to for 'a good lay'.  The chiropractor is really an angel.  Note how he's framed always with light behind him, he 'rescues' Jacob from hell i.e the hospital.  He tells Jacob 'the only things that burn in hell are the memories you won't let go of' - hence the burning by 'the devil' of Jacobs photographs.  Like the angel says the only way he can leave hell is by making peace with these memories.  Jacob is troubled with the death of his son, who he meets at the stairs to heaven (golden light) and makes peace with him.  His son takes him by the hand and leads him up to heaven.  There are countless other symbolic images and dialogue pointing to this theory.*** A haunting, exciting film.  Improves with each viewing!!!",Jacob's Ladder
160,bonnie91,It gets under your skin,8,29 March 2006,"Jacob's Ladder is a hallucinogenic piece that starts with a soldier in the Vietnam War who's been badly wounded. It has some elements of classic horror but could be described better as a psychological thriller, where the director achieves the effect on the audience of putting them in the shoes of the protagonist through effective imagery, camera angles and an excellent script and acting. Tim Robbins, as usual, makes his character quite lovable and is backed by stellar performances from the entire supporting cast to makes this a movie that is difficult to forget and will capture your full attention for the entire 90 minutes. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be made to think outside the box a bit, and also to horror movie fans like me because it has some disturbing and, at times, gory images.",Jacob's Ladder
161,someonesmart21,Confusing and Complicated but still worth watching !,7,7 January 2015,"Finally I watched the movie, this movie has a big cult following and it's one the movies that you have to watch twice for better understanding. So about the movie this movie grips you from the beginning and hold you tight on your seat. The main character of the movie is Jacob ( the title refers to him ) Vietnam war veteran and mourning for his child. The thing is that you view this movie from the Jacobs perspective you really don't what's going on. As the movie passes Jacob realizes that things are different and are changing dramatically or in other words going more complicated.The thing I don't like is that I'd left with a lot of questions and after watching it I'd to read a lot from different sources. This movie is a combination of mystery and thriller, the events changes so quickly that you're left confused but I guess the plot is revealed in the end.There are also some bizarre scenes in this movie which I found rather disturbing anyways if you're looking for a movie that completely requires your attention so this is the one.",Jacob's Ladder
162,Efenstor,Dark philosophy about souls and demons,5,5 August 2008,"Jacob's Ladder instantly reminded me Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"", especially with its soundtrack. Director's devotion to urban desolation is also very similar, though, on the contrary to ""Stalker"", here it's used as an infernal environment for hellish torments of one's departing soul instead of the Stalker's final chaos which turns everything to vanity and brings the ultimate peace. Jacob's Ladder could possibly be a much deeper and more philosophical work of art if, instead of delivering only authors' thoughts on what happens when we're dying while full of unreleased memories, desires and other ""demons"", it delivered something of a Boschian message, warning us of what happens to us when we live mindless lives lacking of beliefs. In fact, while watching the first third of the movie I strongly suspected such a point, thought ""wow"", but then was disappointed. Nevertheless, the movie is incredibly solidly made and direction, music and cinematography are really top notch. There are many interesting concept points besides demons: the guardian angel as a kind doctor, Purgatory in the form of a hospital or unfree souls as mental patients. I cannot say that Jacob's Ladder has some kind of unreleased potential, as it often happens with similar movies, no, it's made very well and does its job, even giving you points to think about, but its potential is too depressive and disgusting to make me rate it high. May be it's my own prejudice but I cannot rate high movies with similar messages inside, despite how profoundly they made.",Jacob's Ladder

But I do wonder about the comments other viewers have made, as if the more clear cut scenes portrayed a real life, rather than the flashbacks and flash forwards of the dying brain.

165,knersisman,Jacob's Ladder,9,20 October 2018,This is much more than a psychological drama. It is a well documented piece of art that portrays existential threats and crisis as well as traumatic experiences mixed with a semi-religious undertone. The puzzling factor is very well done and the director keeps your attention throughout the whole movie. This puzzling factor is the epitome of mystery with some strong elements of the uncanny.,Jacob's Ladder

167,drz,10/10 - much much more than horror,10,30 April 2000,"Classifying Jacob's Ladder as a horror film was quite a mistake. People who look for a horror movie will be dissatisfied. The ones who would really appreciate this film don't usually consider watching horror movies.This is an artistic (but sometimes horrifying) thriller: its message is layered for patient exploration. The horror of the opening scenes is quickly replaced by a clever military thriller, then it is enriched by parables (yes, Biblical ones) and subplots (like the one about the atavistic male agony between family and freedom.) Finally it gives you ""the answer"" (for a question you may have not even asked yet.)The more you (and Tim Robbins) look for answers the more you loose your sanity. But this film shows you that there are more important things than your ""sanity"". If you give up the quest the movie is gone - and you lose much more. If you follow his path you may experience a catharsis that you will probably never forget. This movie may enrich you. It is art in a strange disguise. The experience may serve you as a guide in your life. Just remember when the time comes.I hope I'll remember. I know I will.
PS: Indeed, the end of the movie is not totally ""original"". But what is? Indeed, the story is convoluted. But what else do you expect from a good movie? Indeed,the plot lines sometimes shift, causing intellectual and emotional turmoil in the viewer. But this is what ""art"" is about! Granted, it is not the culmination of humankind's efforts of philosophical or theological discovery. This is a movie, but at that one of the best I have ever seen.",Jacob's Ladder
168,cjaye,Genius,10,29 August 2019,"THIS is genius.Depth, heart, fear... so many things come to mind.This film sticks with you, and brings up so many deep emotions. In one part of your brain it is fantastical. In another, it is fearful. In another, it is sad and lonely and lost. And then there is wit in it too, and throughout it all... an amazing dreamlike feeling... that while you're watching it, you're wondering, is this real, what's off? There's something off... I can't put my finger on it... is this REAL? Almost like Alice In Wonderland going down the Rabbit Hole.This script was sent around forever before it got made.It was impossible - no one was willing to take a chance because... it didn't fit... what a weird film! And I'm sure many idiots along the way, the idiots who give notes on scripts and can't write themselves, which is so much of Hollywood, piped in ""it doesn't work!"" ""it's awful!"" ""CHANGE IT!"" - this or that, and then of course, probably, a lot of: ""It's too expensive to get made.""So the writer, who I'm sure this script must have been all that is dark and light and wonderful in his being, his deep passion, hurt for a little bit, then shelved it for awhile (never giving up on it because it was his heart), wrote a main stream movie ""Ghost"" which was genius in it's own way... and ultimately it had Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze starring, so it was sure to make money... but it was no Jacob's Ladder - but he wrote that, because that's what Hollywood thought (always underestimating the depth of their audience) is the only thing that people want - so he knew he had to do it, and THAT got made when this genius hung around. The masses could understand ""Ghost."" So after he wrote ""Ghost"", which made so much money... the powers that be had to throw him a bone because ""Ghost"" showed them he was bankable and they could take a chance on ""Jacob's Ladder.""I laugh at any bad reviews or naysayers of this film.

174,fikamugg,A dark and surrealistic messenger of hope.,9,13 September 2011,"Adrian Lynes finest hour and a movie that differs considerably from his other work. Its not a pure horror movie because the plot is not simplistic enough. As a viewer you really don't know what it is that haunts Jacob. No defined threat appears. I guess its fair to place the movie in the space between the horror and thriller genres.The story deals with the journey between life and death of a Vietnam casualty. As the story progresses you understand that there must have been some government testing of psychotropic drugs involved and Jacob starts to search for other veterans in his old battalion. Frightened and alone he want answers and to share experiences. As a film-maker building the story round a complex chronological time-frame always comes with a certain risk. Will the audience remain concentrated and keep interest for 90 minutes? The magic is not to overdo it and Mr Lyne uses the chronological jumps masterfully to create a sense of floating uncertainty in the story that blends very well with Jakob's haunted persona, unable to come to rest due to his escalating nightmarish experiences.Something could and should also be said about the special effects. No CGI in this one, and there are some scenes in the film that benefits hugely from this. In particular the hospital scene when Jacob passes through the corridor to hell lying in a hospital bed. The flesh and the individuals with foreshortened limbs that lines up on him are there for real, creating a horrifying and disturbing impression. The dance-floor scene filmed in stroboscopic light when Jezzie appears to have sex with something that looks like a demon were made using life-size models and shot in real time.Some think Tim Robbins finest moment was in Shawshank Redemption and maybe it was but i certainly can't think of a better choice to put Jacob Singer alive. Mr Lyne wanted Robbins boyish innocence, and innate joy in existence to play against the darkness of the character's gradual unraveling, and it works tremendously well. Elisabeth Pena as Jezzie is lovely and convincing and Danny Aiello shines, as so often, in his minor part. The ending is superb and adds greatly to the overall impression. It puts an end to Jacobs misery and gives the answers the viewers have been waiting for. But the film also raises questions, some of which lives long after the after-texts ends. Universal questions about our existence and what happens at the end.This is one of my all time favorites. Intelligent, philosophical and grand. Bravo Mr Lyne.",Jacob's Ladder

I still loved the movie and I plan on watching it again to see if I can understand it a little better.

176,travisyoung,More than a movie,8,5 July 2008,"This is a superbly crafted film that transcends mere entertainment and becomes an experience much greater than the sum of its parts. When you watch this movie, you are unleashing a very powerful force that short-circuits your natural ability to remain in control. It is like hypnotism, you have no choice...you are unable to think, act, or even believe apart from the intense feelings Jacob's Ladder inspires.Tim Robbins is Jacob Singer, a warm and genuinely likable Vietnam veteran who, in spite of earning a doctoral degree, chooses to find employment working for the U.S. Postal Service. We learn in bits and pieces as the plot unfolds that his service in Vietnam included a very frightening battle, and the events set in motion on that fateful day parallel what could be his descent into madness.Jacob's life suddenly begins to resemble Hell. He is literally chased by confusion, fear, and death, he sees unbelievably terrifying images, has horrific experiences that whether real or imagined are too frightening to bear alone. His only comfort comes in the form of the woman he lives with, Jezzie (Elizabeth Pena), and his chiropractor, Louis (Danny Aiello). Each of these people's relationships with Jacob represent more than just the roles they fulfill in his life, they are absolute forces at battle for his sanity, and possibly even his soul.His torment begins to include the past as well, the undeniable love he still has for his ex-wife and painful memories of his son Gabe, who died tragically in an accident (played by a young and virtually undiscovered Macauley Culkin). As all these elements of the past, present and future collide in shocking hallucinations, Jacob slowly begins to suspect he could be the victim of a secret Army drug experiment gone terribly wrong.With a haunted desperation, he embarks on a journey to find out what on earth happened to him - only his visions / flashbacks / flashforwards have become so delusional that reality and fantasy are hopelessly interwoven and nothing is as it seems. All that is decipherable is good and evil, life and death. And at the end of his nightmare, all he has to do is choose.That's all I will share of the story. I'm not going to do you the disservice of spoiling the experience this movie is. Suffice it to say, there is much more to know, and nothing left to tell.Meanwhile, there is not enough that can be said of Robbins' performance...although he has had better roles, never before or since has he portrayed his own emotions so nakedly. This is director Adrian Lyne's best by far, and by the way he's no slouch (Fatal Attraction, 9 1/2 Weeks).This is not a horror movie as some may think, it is human drama masterfully disguised as a supernatural thriller. The basic elements of Jacob's Ladder have been plundered several times in recent years. We have been suckered by flashy films with clever plot twists that cheat us on story, characters, and technical excellence. This film delivers all that and more. Movies like this are set apart from the rest of the pack because you don't just watch stuff like this, you feel it too.",Jacob's Ladder

Tim Robbins plays Vietnam vet who is suffering from perhaps post traumatic disorder or something else. He realizes that almost the entirety of his battalion is also going through something similar. He decides to make sense of this and get answers. As mentioned earlier the images are surreal and terrifying as is the slow descent into madness that we as audiences feel.

And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the LORD stood beside him, and said: ""I am the LORD, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.

No. This movie is much different. Even with the knowledge we obtain in the end of the film, there are still open ends left to the viewer themselves.

181,WinterOf63,Don't hold on to life too tight ...,10,26 June 2021,"Or you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth. That line, uttered by Jacob Singer's chiropractor, Louis, played by Danny Aiello, sums up Jacob's Ladder, one of my favorite movies, in a nutshell.Jacob, played by Tim Robbins, seems to be mortally wounded in combat in Viet Nam in the opening scene of the movie, but in the next scene, it appears that Jacob has cheated death. He is taking the subway home from work in a very grungy New York City of the 1970s. He stumbles out of the train at the Bergen St. Exit, but the stairs to the street are chained off. That forces him to cross the tracks to the opposite platform and almost gets him killed. The conductor of the train that almost hits him is a mysterious shape whose head seems to be vibrating at a hundred mph. That is the first of a series of odd experiences, some of which are near death experiences, as Jacob's life seems to become more nightmarish with each passing day.Jacob carries on his life as normally as he can and, as he does, we learn about his background. He was married and had three sons with his ex, but one of them, Gabe, was killed accidentally. He has a PhD, but never used it. He said he was tired of thinking, so he went to work for the Post Office. Currently he lives with his girlfriend and fellow postal worker, Jezebel, played by Elizabeth Pena, in a modest apartment.The strange happenings in Jacob's life continue to escalate, culminating in a series of disturbing visions when he attends a party with Jezzie. Dancing is not Jacob's thing, while Jezzie is a really hot dancer. While Jezzie is out dirty dancing, Jacob has a vision of Jezzie seemingly being penetrated by a grotesque black appendage emanating from her demonic dance partner that passes all the way through her and comes out her mouth. Jacob screams and passes out. He wakes up under water in an ice bath to get his temperature down.Interlaced throughout the movie are flashbacks to Viet Nam. Jacob reunites with the surviving members of his old unit and they're having experiences similar to his. At one point they try to sue the government to find out what happened to their unit. The government denies that his unit was ever in Viet Nam. But right after his lawsuit falls apart, Jacob is abducted by men that tell him they've been watching him. Before they can harm him, he is able to leap out of the car and escape, but in the process he hurts his back. This leads to the most nightmarish scene in the movie. He winds up in a hospital and is being taken to surgery through hallways filled with Goyaesque figures and severed body parts. The ""surgeons"" flat out tell him he's dead or he wouldn't be where he is. Jezzie is present around the table too, dressed in scrubs. She offers no help. He passes out as a man with no eyes sticks a needle into his brain.Luckily, when he comes to, he is rescued from the hospital by his beloved chiropractor, Louis. Louis tries to explain what is happening to him. Returning to his apartment, he receives a phone call from a man who knows what really happened to Jacob's unit. They meet in an alley and Michael explains that the Army was testing a drug called The Ladder that was supposed to make the troops more aggressive. It worked too well. The members of his unit killed each other.Jacob heads for his parents home, perhaps hoping to get back with his ex and start over, but the house is empty. He hears a noise and sees his dead son Gabe, who takes him by the hand and leads him into the light. In a last flashback to Nam, Jacob remembers one of his Army buddies stabbing him to death and let's go. A doctor in the Field hospital comments that he ""fought like hell"" and casually flips his dog tags to a clerk, so he can be bagged and tagged.As I said. This is one of my favorite movies. I highly recommend it. It's more creepy than scary. Some find it depressing. You won't go away unaffected.",Jacob's Ladder

The story is stale at times but the viewer is kept interested as they know only as much as the main character knows. It all unravels beautifully as we see Jacob fight with the idea of death. It never underestimates its audience. The only problem I had with the movie was that the pacing was weird and out of control at times. Overall good watch that needs a bit patience.,Jacob's Ladder

This is a clue to the specifically Catholic nature of the imagery and central thrust of the film (or at least one aspect of it).I recently watched this movie again when I showed it to my girlfriend who, annoyingly, managed to grasp it pretty well on her first viewing. Needless to say, we sat up for hours talking about it afterwards.This is one of my favourite movies of all time - I believe only 'The Elephant Man' and '2001: A Space Odyssey' can match it in terms of humanity, poignancy and sheer epiphanic power.",Jacob's Ladder
184,Logos_Removed,"It's not good, it's a classic movie.",10,25 December 2002,"The film takes place within the dying mind of a soldier in Vietnam. Jacob believes the war is far behind him and that he is living his life with his wife and a job as a postman. A life that is torn apart by strange creatures that his chiropractor tells him are demons or angels depending on ones point of view.Not a horror movie in the strict sense of the word, but Jacobs Ladder has an atmosphere of disturbing creepiness. As in any good H.P Lovecraft story you don't get a good look at the nightmare creatures, which makes them more scary than not. The film utilizes much more realistic fears as well as the demons, such as the surreal psychiatric institute sequence, and conspiracy theory paranoia, etc. The concept of the other-worldly creatures being demons or angels is similar to Hellraiser, where the cenobites are either, depending on how you look at them. Unlike that movie Jacobs Ladder doesn't feel like a fairy story. It feels like a freezing blast of wind from the depths of death itself as Jacob's soul is burned away.Everything is right in this movie. The direction, acting and dialogue are flawless. The plot is intricate and complex but unfolds logically at a natural pace. The photography is atmospheric and good to look at, and the special effects are understated and yet really make the impact they are supposed to.This film isn't just good, it is a classic - a movie of movies standing high above the usual junk we get to see.

Still find it a masterpiece, albeit painful to watch, 30 years later.It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where the greatness of this movie really is, the actors (are they acting or is it real pain)? The mesmerising plot? The truly great message? Everything is well balanced and exceptionally original and unpredictable that one does not want it to end despite knowing what is going on and the physical torture one goes through identifying with the main character; it is not a magical escape from reality filled with tender feelings and feel-good moments a la Forrest Gump, be aware!
It is rather a visual representation of the inevitability of our demise and the acceptance of it without relying on any religious or mystical credence; no suspension of disbelief necessary and cheap scares do not live here.One of those rare gems that came out unexpected from all the garbage and triviality of modern cinema....Watch it and let it flow through you like the protagonist does in the end, you will not be disappointed,N.B. it is not a horror movie, it is exactly the opposite, a celebration of life!",Jacob's Ladder
186,AndyInThePieWithAlmonds,The greatest movie ever made?,10,25 November 1998,"There is surely no movie which benefits so much from repeated viewing as Jacob's Ladder. What at first can be interpreted as a mere feature length supernatural conspiracy thriller (sort of like a grown up X Files), eventually evolves into an afterlife allegory of astonishing scope and power. The hints are subtle and obscure: The woman Jacob lives with for much of the film may seem harmless, but her name, Jezebel, is laden with connotations, as are quotes like 'you sold your soul, remember' and her open hostility towards Jacob's son, through whom salvation lies. What is never in doubt is the central spiritual role played throughout by Danny Aiello (""did anyone ever tell you you look like an angel Louis?"") or the vivid reality of the truly terrifying demons that appear round every corner.Bearing in mind this translation of the movie,it has long since confused me what role the whole paranoid 'hallucinogenics in Vietnam' plot serves. I think perhaps it simply makes the whole experience a great deal more coherent and accessible to those who can't be bothered to watch for biblical references. There is of course one more suggestion, which is that the entire plot is rooted in Dante's Inferno, which I'm not even going to pretend to have read! So why is this my favourite movie? Well, it has the most beautiful ending I can think of (the only movie, along with ET, that makes me cry). It has some of the greatest scenes, particularly the party scene, wherein Jezzie appears to be mating with some demonic creature on the dance floor. Above all, it has unprecedented depth for a movie in the nineties and, as with The Shawshank Redemption, a Tim Robbins performance which elevates it still further.

187,zootrouble,Creepy,8,10 December 2006,"What's so great about this film is that it is very circular. Did the vets go through the drug-induced nightmare or didn't they? The film takes us to the modern life of a man who sees demons everywhere he looks. Paranoia and hallucination seem to be following him. When he meets with some of his old war buddies, he realizes the paranoia is not specific to him. What caused it? In the film, we at first learn that a drug that turns soldiers into ruthless killers was given to the soldiers to make them destroy their enemies. It all seems to fit until the last frame (making this a film which needs to be watched until the end).

Although I must say I was expecting a lot more out of it, it wasn't as scary as I was expecting it to be but at the same time it still found a way to creep me out, Tim Robbins put on a Phenomenal acting Job, you can almost feel what he is going through.The images of the demons that are seen in this movie is absolutely wild, the way that they are portrayed in this film is like a seizure, because a lot of the demons that are shown have fast head movements and in one particular scene there is the use of strobe lights when some of the demons are visible and I don't recommend anyone with epilepsy to view that scene.The atmosphere of this film is dark and depressing which is another trait that makes this movie so fantastic because you can almost feel the way Jacob(Tim Robbins) is feeling. Its also one of those movies that really confuses you at times but in the end it all comes together.This film is not for everyone but it ranks high on my movie list.",Jacob's Ladder

It doesn't need to try and prove itself with slasher scenes and the like, and it is a worthy equal to the excellent Don't Look Now made in 1973. Tim Robbins is another Hollywood actor who chooses his roles very carefully and refuses to toe the line, keep the status quo, do a film for the sake of a box office hit, however you choose to express it and it has paid off. This film also sensitively portrays how a parent copes with the loss of a child, and the final scene is very moving even to me as a non parent.

It's certainly a movie designed to mess with ones' mind. This is an intentional device to draw the audience further into the plight of Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins). I don't want to give much away but what you see the first time is never what you will see later.The FX are genuinely creepy and they aren't that complex. A lot the scariest images and moments in this film are all created in-camera. The conspiracy elements anticipate the X-Files; especially in relation to the Vietnam War. Tim Robbins gives a convincing performance. He makes Jacob Singer a very likable guy -- the everyman we can relate to and feel for. The film is rife with Biblical imagery and allusions from the title onwards. There's a lot more to unpack there and I look forward to doing so in future viewings.",Jacob's Ladder

Tim Robbins is awesome throughout as our world weary anti-hero, never quite believing what's happening to him and never quite sure if anything he see's or says is real. Director Adrian Lyne includes some truly scary and disturbing scenes which are definitely not for the weak-stomached or easily upset. A mean crossover of war, horror, thriller and even film noir. Switching between flashbacks, dreams, reality and imagination of the mind this film is definitely worth checking out, but if you've not seen it before then you had better watch it with a friend or you'll have your own problems with paranoia and monsters on the underground...",Jacob's Ladder

194,pwfinch,Tormented everyman struggles with his personal demons  or does he?,6,7 March 2007,"A genuinely scary but at the same time moving horror story, which unfortunately suffers from occasional muddled moments.Tim Robbins makes a very appealing hero, and Andrian Lyne directs with aplomb, plunging us into a seedy, trash-strewn New York, which is both desolate and eerie, particularly in the subway sequences. To all intents and purposes, this gritty, brooding ghost story should have blown its audiences away. However, the main question at the time was, and remains: what's it all about? On one hand, there's clearly some kind of high-level conspiracy to keep the Vietnam vets in the dark, or even eliminate them; while on the other, an occult, even demonic force is apparently at work. And this weird paradox is never really resolved, which is undoubtedly the film's main weakness. Who is the hippie chemist who turns up right near the end, for example (Jake's already dead at this stage)? And if what this movie is really about is a tortured soul's struggle through Purgatory, then why is so much time (and so many characters) given to the investigation into the chemical testing incident? These oddities aside, this is one effectively realised chiller. The convincing urban grime is juxtaposed with supernatural elements that at first glance would seem more at home in medieval myth, yet it complements them perfectly, invoking a genuinely disturbing atmosphere, while Jake's descent to the gates of Hell (located in the hospital basement) is one of the most hair-raising moments in cinematic horror.In our age of militant atheism, the fact that our hero is eventually redeemed by the intervention of angels and heavenly spirits has made it fashionable to mock this movie, but that's missing the point. If anything, JACOB'S LADDER is a metaphor for the battle through life as much as through death. Not everyone in this movie is stone-cold evil. In fact, apart from the briefly seen demons, hardly anyone is. Sure, there is selfishness, ignorance, impatience, dishonesty, lack of pity, not to mention the impenetrable wall of bureaucracy  these are the main obstacles Jake faces. But then don't we all? A fascinating parable of the modern age, for the most part intelligently told.",Jacob's Ladder

197,sisyphus-8,It's worth the multiple viewings that it requires,9,3 August 1999,"I've seen this movie three times now, and I finally understand how everything ties in to everything else. It takes a few sittings to realize exactly how everything comes together like this, but once you understand the ""big picture,"" it takes the film to another level entirely.This is a brilliantly allegorical story that has a few genuinely creepy and disorienting moments. But beyond being an above-average psychological horror movie, it's also a well-executed take on ""The Divine Comedy"" that borders on the surreal. The acting isn't always convincing, but Lyne's direction and Rubin's script (not to mention the haunting score) make up for this.Well-crafted throughout, with a few minor but noticeable flaws.",Jacob's Ladder
198,Raoul-16,"""It's A Wonderful Life"" for the Viet Nam generation",10,30 August 1999,"What can I say?  This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it'll level you if you really take it all in.  The summary above is how a friend described it once, and in an off-hand way it nearly does the film justice. I saw this in the theater when it first came out, not really knowing what to expect.  It was such a powerful experience that my legs were literally physically weak by the end, and I almost couldn't walk back to my dorm. It is intense in a way that nothing else I've seen is--in a deeply spiritual way.  Given a chance, this movie will reach deep into your heart and your soul.  The themes from Dante and Eckhart that run through the script are not squandered in the least.  In a lesser movie, they would be pretentious decoration, but not here.  This is the story of a man shaken in his faith in almost everything--a modern-day Job--a man who goes through such torment and horror that, finally, simply allowing him to die is the most merciful way to end the film, and it is a truly beautiful ending.  The terror at work here is not at all of the usual variety--it is a sort of mystical terror, and this is the kind of movie that has the potential to leave you a different person after watching it.  (It seems perhaps relevant to mention at this point that I am not a particularly Christian person, and you don't have to be to appreciate the imagery and themes here.  The film employs Christian ideas and thought, but from the perspective of the mystic, not in an orthodox manner.) The multiple comments to the effect that this movie will require repeated viewings are certainly deserved, as it is complexly structured and may seem very ambiguous or even chaotic at first.  Who truly appreciates ""Citizen Kane"" upon a first viewing, though?  Who really comprehends ""Hamlet"" the first time he reads it?  This is certainly also a work which needs to be seen a few times to really sink in, but if you give it a chance you will almost certainly want to.",Jacob's Ladder

It just touches your soul. Jacob Singer amazingly starred by Tim Robbins, is suffering from severe hallucinations, hellish hallucinations, which are seriously disturbing him. The story develops trough this idea, as the visions get worst and worst. Danny Aiello is also great. Elizabeh Peña stars as Jacob´s strange and multi-faced girlfriend. Adrian Lyne´s true masterpiece, Jacob´s Ladder is a film that touches your soul and your mind.

It also makes a strong political statement. It speaks mountains about human nature and religion. And its an intriguing puzzle to boot.As other reviewers have pointed out, some of the scary effects originated here have since become cliche. The cinematography is as good as it gets. The acting is too. We know what's become of Tim Robbins, Danny Ailleo, Jason Alexander, and Macaulay Culkin, but what's become of the Elisabeth Pena who was the most outstanding of all here?Watch this movie without distractions and without worrying about if the person you are watching this is enjoying it or not.

202,eli-ass,Gripping and depressing ...,8,28 May 2010,"HELL, I finally got it and fortunately I liked it.We follow the main character Jacob Singer (played by Tim Robbins) who was a veteran in Vietnam through his life that - from the start - gets stranger and stranger. Having lost his son and been through the war we start to realize there is something seriously wrong with this guy who is more and more lead by fear and despair as he increasingly suffers from creepy hallucinations ... But what is that really all about?This film is twisty and at times confusing but also very compelling. From the craftsmanship of film making this here is on a high level but what makes it work is mainly the really strong acting. Robbins performance is marvelous and we really feel with him and get in a kind of depressive mood ... yes this film is kinda depressing and certainly not a funny entertaining piece. There are two things about the movie that bothered me. First of all there is one scene in the movie that kinda spoils its own ending - but OK. Secondly though the ""surprising ending"" works in a way ... from the content throughout the film there remains - for me at least - the big question after the end: ""Does this really all make sense?"" Considering the ending I can not directly see some of the connections between everything that happens ... but after I talked a bit about it, it kinda grew on me and ... anyway: a gripping, intelligent, well-crafted experience.Cause of some doubts I rate this film ""only"" (a weak) 8 / 10.",Jacob's Ladder

204,agustintomaslarghi,A gem of the psychological thriller genre,9,20 August 2017,"This is the first review that I write on IMDb, just for the fact that this is a terribly underrated film, and I couldn't believe that this film scored just a 7.5/10 while films such as The Sixth Sense scored a 8.1/10Jacob's Ladder kept me at the edge of my seat all the time, not knowing what to expect next. This film embodies the core principles of the psychological thriller genre, you don't know if the protagonist is just suffering from PTSD, if is something going wrong for real, if his in hell or something like that, what is real and what is in his mind.The acting of Tim Robbins in this film is really outstanding, you can feel the fear and the pain of the protagonist through the film with each dialog, with each scene, you just want him to have some peace. The movie throws at you many symbolisms, making you guess what's going on.If you like the Silent Hill game sage (which is heavily influenced by this film) you're going to love this film.If you like psychological thrillers but you hate when the plot is really obvious or the plot twist is just a slap on your face, be sure that this isn't that kind of film.Not gonna lie you, the ending can make you feel a little empty, but if you're watching a psychological thriller you're not in for the happy ending.This film is twice as good when you watch it a second time, because you can tie all loose ends and all the symbolisms through the movie.

205,MrGrundle,"Very creepy, very convoluted....",7,8 June 2006,"JACOB'S LADDER is an exceptionally creepy film, very adept at conveying a pervasive sense of impending doom. Credit the film editor with effective segues from one 'reality' to the next as this film bounces between four alternate worlds. There is Jacob pre-Nam with wife and kids, Jacob in Nam, Jacob post-Nam with Jezebel, and the hallucinatory trips occurring in the post-Nam world. This film succeeded for me when it was unclear which of these worlds were real and which were fabricated (if any). With the boundaries of existence blurred, there is ample room for the viewer to make his own conclusions as to what is really happening to Jacob. The camera work and clever direction by Adrian Lyne combine with these story elements to form a very disturbing picture.Unfortunately, this film becomes too convoluted as it tries to identify and define everything that is going on in the story (ie the mind of Jacob). The last 20 minutes or so of this feature defeated what I was enjoying for the first two hours. A film is a collaboration of talent, each person with their own vision, hoping to streamline it all into a watchable whole. Sometimes there are too many voices. Watching the special features on the DVD, it is clear that some of the flourishes that Mr. Lyne brought to the table were essential (much of the hellish hospital sequence is of his vision), but I feel that too much was said, and it detracts from that whole.One undeniable virtue of this film is that it was ahead of its time in horror technique. Lyne does retain some of the creepy landscape and ominous shadow staples of horror films, but the frenetic, jumpy camera work is the real backbone of the movie. The ""head moving faster than the camera"" scenes were terrifying, apropos considering Jacob's own head seems to be moving faster than life. Nearly two decades later I see much of these stylistic elements emulated consistently. It was Lyne's idea that by hinting at the monsters in the shadows, without clearly showing them, would prove more effective because the viewer's imagination could then provide an image of whatever scares them individually. Bravo, Mr. Lyne. Score one for the lost art of subtlety. If only he could have held the same reserve when stumbling through the denouement.The characterization of the supporting cast is lackluster, with the exception of Danny Aiello's sensational turn as Louis, the 'Oracle' of this film. Were it not for the superb acting of Tim Robbins, I feel this film would have fallen flat as one full of style but short on substance. It is Robbins' acting that grips the viewer, keeping us rapt for two hours, trying to sift through the pieces of a ruined mind to find the truth among the rubble.Most horror films have hardly any plot at all, and succeed brilliantly in spite of this because they are fun, mindless entertainment. JACOB'S LADDER condescends to be intellectually complete, so it is graded on a tougher scale than other genre efforts. Lyne should have taken the same approach to plot as he did toward visual scares and let the viewer fill in the blanks. Things are scarier that way.7/10* Recommended. Not perfect, but very good. Great ""look"", Robbins excels.",Jacob's Ladder
206,bigfanofthebob42,Jiggling face goodness!,9,8 March 2006,"I want to kill Macaulay Culkin. This thought occurred to me as I was watching Jacob's Ladder and realized that the only reason he is in the movie is because studio executives made them put a kid in the movie to be more relatable. He screwed up way too many good movies when he was a kid. Home Alone would have been a lot better if it was just Joe Pesci breaking into an empty house and stealing crap.But anyway, this is Jacob's Ladder, written by the fag who wrote Ghost. (by fag of course I mean an English term for cigarette, because I want to light this guy on fire) Jacob's Ladder is a lot better than that piece of crap, and is actually a really good movie. It's just that the writer tries to screw everything up with his sorta weak ear for dialogue. Thankfully, Bruce Joel Rubin (if that is your real three names), you failed on all counts. Instead, Adrian Lyne (whose name for some reason reminds me of fabric softener) makes this into one of the best freakouts in the history of movies of the films of the cinema. Shaky head people abound. And this is the first and last time I've ever seen stubby legged drooling people and breastfeeding women crawling on the same grated ceiling at the same time. I've seen them on different grated ceilings, but this is the first movie to combine the stubby legged drooling people and the breastfeeding women in the same sequence.Some of the imagery in this movie is just plain brilliant. And by brilliant, I mean ""Known to cause Post Traumatic Stress Disorder"", which is what I mean normally when I say ""brilliant"". But some sit questionably near scenes of Tim Robbins staring at pictures of Macaulay Culkin and crying in a non-horrified way. This is of course the fault of the studio. Screw you, studio.So, anyhoo, this movie also has Ving Rhames in it for a couple scenes, but for some reason it isn't quite as good as you would expect when it comes to the Ving Rhames factor. For one, I don't think he ever punctuates a sentence with ""motherf**ker"", and for two I don't think he ever holds a shotgun, both of which are what happens in every other good Ving Rhames- starring movie.Okay, so the movie doesn't really have a story. But it does have things that happen or don't happen. And it has a very good idea behind it. It's one of the movies I would want to watch in the last 24 hours of my life. That twenty two of those hours will probably be porn is beside the point.Anyway, Bruce Joel Rubin. He's just as much of a pretentious dick on the DVD documentary as you can tell he is by knowing that he wrote Ghost. His script often alternates between obvious sentimentality and juvenile dirty tough guy talk I remember writing when I was twelve and thought I could write a movie. Bruce Joel Rubin was not twelve when he wrote this movie, or at least he's the oldest twelve year old I've ever had the misfortune of seeing. Okay, I'm exaggerating. The writing sometimes bugs me and interferes with my enjoyment of the rest of the awesome, awesome movie. But anyhoo, regardless of my nitpick (that stupid, infinitely pickable nit called Bruce Joel Rubin), it's a good freakout that keeps you in a constant state of dread, disturbance, and depression.Unfortunately, I'm still not out of this state.

His counsel is clear, forceful and backed with the logic that only experience cannot deride. Robbins, as Singer, is Man.

It succeeds by immersing you in the experience of this - by the end you have learnt what it is saying about the human condition through feeling it, not being told it - which is exactly how good storytelling should work. It takes you to some very dark places - I watched it alone at night and was terrified, but it's far from gratuitous, the story depends on it.If done badly this film could have been a real mess, but the quality of direction, acting and all the other components see it through, and it deserves classic status.",Jacob's Ladder

This is the problem I have with the movie...it's one thing to have a story about a drug trip, but to throw everything at you and answer away any inconsistencies by saying ""Well he was high when it was happening""...sorry, I don't by that...do some more research before shooting begins guys!

217,divemaster13,One of the best psychological horror/mystery/dramas you can find,10,12 February 2010,"Have you ever had one of those dreams where, after you wake up, the palpable relief is overwhelming that it was only a dream and not that nightmare you were in? Probably. Most of us can relate to that feeling. ""Thank God it was only a dream!"" What if you awoke from such a dream, started going about your daily business, and then realized that *this* was the dream and the nightmare you thought you woke up from was your real life? How terrifying would that be? Jacob Singer is living such a life. He's back home from Vietnam, settled in with a hot girlfriend, and has a mundane job at the post office. He's a smart fellow (his Army mates gave him the nickname ""The Professor"" because he earned a doctorate but never did anything with it).But Jacob has inner demons that cause turmoil in his life. He's divorced from his wife, but still feels a connection. And he has to deal with the painful memories of one of his young children, who was killed prior to Jacob leaving for Vietnam. And his memory of a particular event in Vietnam that he can't explain and still haunts him.But what Jacob has to face now is that these inner demons have shown themselves to be real (at least, to him), and are tormenting him. He goes to see his regular VA counselor, only to be told there is no record of such a doctor and no file for Jacob ever having been there. He sees strange things out of the corner of his eye that he can't explain. When he realizes that his platoon mates are experiencing a similar nightmarish existence, they go to a lawyer who checks out their story and tells them they were never even in Vietnam. They were all discharged on psycho grounds after going nutso on a training exercise.Jacob becomes convinced that they were all part of some sort of Army ""experiment"" that did something to them, but he can't explain what because the things he is experiencing have no explanation. Were they all part of some Manchurian Candidate group hypnosis experience? Guinea pigs in chemical warfare testing? Is Jacob truly going crazy? Or, is it an example of ""I'm not paranoid if they really are coming to get me""?""Jacob's Ladder"" is a frightfully effective film of a man who may or may not be losing his sanity. Robbins is perfect as the quiet, introspective, amiable fellow who is at the end of his rope and has nowhere to turn. Director Lyne does a great job keeping the horror in the shadows; playing with your mind's ability to extrapolate and fill in a scene. The film works much better as a subtle exercise in psychological horror, as evidenced from a few more explicit scenes wisely cut from the film (but available on the DVD.) Even so, there are images so frightening that you will probably jump a couple of times. And replay them in your head while trying to sleep later. (Good luck.).The film works best if you go in cold. Allow the film to unfold and reveal its secrets, and then watch it again. This movie deserves NOT to be spoiled, but I see plenty of reviews doing just that. Shame on those people.",Jacob's Ladder

From the big picture, down to the tiniest details that only emerge after an 8th viewing, this film is flawless.Everyone I've ever known (myself included) doesn't ever really understand this movie the first time around, which is to its credit.  (See below for my interpretation.)  But this film is brilliant not because its confusing, but because of its high philosophy, perfectly framed over its wild story.  This is the best movie I have ever seen in terms of capturing a waking dream (or nightmare as it were.)""Thought-provoking"" is an almost demeaning phrase for this movie, as it successfully tackles the big issues of good vs. evil, redemption, and the meaning of life itself.  So far, this film may not sound like a horror movie, but there are plenty of moments that are not only frightening, but so disturbing that they'll haunt you for weeks.  All that on top of great acting, cinematography, and score.  If you care about being an intellectual (and are therefore sickened by so much of the moronic cinema out there,) please watch this movie.  If you don't get it, come back and read the final part of this review.*SPOILER WARNING* If you've seen ""Jacob's Ladder"" and you don't quite get it then ... Jacob is dying.  From the first scene in Vietnam to the end, Jacob is suffering from narcotic delusions on top of the flashbacks of his life. The movie covers Jacob's spiritual salvation (or damnation) as he is visited by angels and demons to resolve the major dilemmas of his life (his son's death, his would-be infidelity, etc.)  But in the end, nothing in the movie ever really happens in reality; it's just Jacob's final visions as his soul exits to heaven. This movie IS the tunnel of light at the end.  I told you it was brilliant!  Watch it again, and appreciate the subtle allusions to religion and literature, and background details like random people having tails or horns.  Now that you know what really happens, this movie will show you that much more.",Jacob's Ladder
220,abbywhiting,The story was there....,6,13 March 2019,"To begin with, I'm not a huge fan of horror/thriller movies. I intended this movie to be more of a psychological thriller, however, it was not executed that way. Let me first say that the story was there. It provided an insightful look on the horrors of the Vietnam war (some things might be true than not) and how destructive it was to human lives. However, I found that the writing scapegoated some of the main plots, like they almost ran out of time to execute it thoroughly. I didn't feel anything was accomplished by the end of it. If you're a fan of genuine terror and horror, you will enjoy the cinematography most definitely. But I didn't watch it for the horror unfortunately, and I felt a little disappointed by the writing. The horror factor definitely took precedence over the writing.",Jacob's Ladder
221,dnjjr,Outstanding Tale of Psychological Terror,10,27 May 2006,"N.B.: Spoilers within. If you have never seen ""Jacob's Ladder,"" do not read beyond this first paragraph. I would never ruin the special experience for the first-time viewer. Just know that it is not for the faint of heart, but that none of its disturbing material  which there is a lot of  is gratuitous: I promise you. If you're up for the film's emotional intensity, graphic visual style, and thought-provoking plot, then see it. Period.This entire movie (except for a single scene I can think of) takes place in, is made of, Jacob Singer's mind. He is on a long, agonizing search. What really happened to him in Vietnam? Why are demons tormenting him? Why are secretive army thugs harassing him? Why is his very existence a disintegrating fugue between three worlds? Is he even alive, or is he experiencing hell? Ultimately, what is the meaning of his life? Roughly in the manner of ""Slaughterhouse Five,"" Jacob lurches uncontrollably between 'Nam, life with Jezebel, and life with Sarah and their two sons. Which is real, and which is only a dream? We are kept guessing, and this really propels the story forward. Jezebel is a purposely complex character: highly sensuous, feisty and impatient, compassionate and concerned. Sarah and the children are all about stability and love. 'Nam is, of course, Jacob's worst nightmare. But his deepest anguish is the loss of his youngest, favorite son, Gabe, who died in a tragic, untimely accident.Evil seems to be winning the war through much of the film, but Jacob's visits to his chiropractor, Louis, are oases of relief and Light. Louis is literally the film's guardian angel: sage, mentor, savior. Not only does this angel bravely extract Jacob from a hellish entrapment in the hospital; his wise words (see below) revisit Jacob in the penultimate scene and help him achieve his final release. The appearance late in the film of ""the Chemist"" offers another temporary reprieve from the terror, if only because he has an important piece of the Truth.""Jacob's Ladder"" of course does not belong to the traditional horror genre. It is far richer; a uniquely psychological-horror film. It is so effective because the viewer is inside Jacob's mental state, experiencing the horrors and fears as he does. For all the emphasis on evil, there is a thread of Good, often in symbolic Christian guise which structures the film in a long tradition. The main characters' names: Jacob, in the Bible the personification of personal struggle; Jezebel, thought of through the ages as all that is wicked in Woman (yet our Jezebel here is much more); Sarah, astonishing beauty; Eli, the Old Testament priest and judge; and Gabriel, the ""Left Hand of God,"" chief messenger who is sent to earth to prophesy and aid. There is Jacob's Ladder, the gateway by which angels pass from heaven to earth and back. And there is the welcome presence of Louis, who quotes Meister Eckhart, the 14th-century Christian mystic and philosopher. In Jacob's most crucial meeting with Louis, he hears Eckhart's decisive wisdom. To crudely paraphrase: in death, or in one's fear of it, let go of all earthly concerns, and the demons will release you.Director Adrian Lyne is brilliant here; this film has to be his magnum opus (to date). He works effectively between sustained eeriness, flat-out terror, and meditative quiet. Every technical element is impeccably realized and integrated, and the acting is first-rate. The character of Jacob has to be one of the most beaten down, harried, confused, and embattled I've ever seen, yet he is a fighter to the end. He drives himself toward the answers. Tim Robbins could have easily slipped into overdone caricature, but he finesses the role admirably. Elizabeth Pena captures the many shadings of Jezebel. Danny Aiello conveys persuasively Louis's strength and serenity. And kudos to writer Bruce Joel Rubin, who  after all of the dark, demonic struggles and bewildering reality bending  rewards Jacob, and us, with a transcendent resolution to the greatest questions there are at the end.I won't even bother with what is real and what is not and what is what, except to say that the film may or may not be a take on the great Ambrose Bierce short story ""An Incident at Owl Creek Bridge."" Despite any concrete interpretations even by its director or writer, their own creation defies easy answers. I welcome a film of diverse readings. It means very different things to different people; it says something new with each viewing. (Personally speaking, I don't watch this film often; it has a powerful spell over me that I don't want to lose.) A last word about the music: Maurice Jarre's haunting and unsettling score perfectly supports the story. His contribution to the feel of the moment is immense. Finally, there is the coup of using the song ""Sonny Boy,"" which becomes a leitmotif for Gabe, the absolute love of Jacob's life. (It's an astounding fit: ""...You're sent from heaven and I know your worth / You made a heaven for me right here on the earth / When I'm old and gray, dear, promise you won't stray, dear / for I love you, Sonny Boy."") Early in the film we briefly see Jacob bouncing along in his Postal truck: he is casually singing a broken version of the song. At Gabe's first appearance, the song sounds as if from a magical music box. A minute later, father and son sing it together as Gabe is tucked into bed. But, in a jaw-dropping stroke, the classic version by Al Jolson wafts into the air just after Jacob is pronounced dead in the final moments; it continues through the fade-to-black and into the credits...it segues into the beyond. Is it the last thought Jacob has on earth?",Jacob's Ladder
222,oscar-50,One of the greatest films ever made,10,19 August 1999,Jacob's Ladder may not be the most innovative or technically great film(qualities that the American Film Institute honors) but artistically it is one of the greatest films ever made. Jacob's Ladder is a complex multilayered movie (too complex and multilayered for most). I won't go into details because they have already been covered by other users. I will say though that anyone considering watching Jacob's Ladder should understand that it will probably take multiple viewings to come to a complete understanding of the film. I would also recommend seeing it on DVD (the deleted scenes and documentary are great). If you take the time to understand this movie you won't be dissapointed.,Jacob's Ladder
223,robamen9,Great film,8,30 April 2000,"If you liked the 6th sense you should like this more eldritch and disturbing film.  Some have sniped that this is derivative of the Twilight Zone episode/Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode Occurrence at Owl Creek bridge.  But that Ambrose Bierce story carries the germ of Jacob's ladder but the film if considered derivative  is a much more fleshed out modern interpretation of that tale.I cannot comment on Carnival of Souls, I have not seen it, but I enjoyed this darker, thoughtful film than the much hailed 6th Sense.  6th Sense was good but its storyline  depends more on the twist ending then Jacob's Ladder did.",Jacob's Ladder
224,kgratton,Bruce Joel Rubin should get a life?,9,11 June 2006,"Great film, but the writer, Bruce Joel Rubin, has now written at least three screenplays dealing with the after-life: 'Jacob's Ladder', 'Brainstorm' and 'Ghost'. Of those three, only 'Ghost' explicitly propounds the 'reality' of a life after death. In the other two films, the 'walking toward the light' mentioned by those who have endured near-death experiences could be mere hallucination.'Jacob's Ladder' improves on the plot twist in 'The Sixth Sense'. In the latter, the plot loses potency after the first viewing, because the plot twist is a device that changes your perception of the entire story. In 'Jacob's Ladder', there are clues right throughout the story that he might actually be dead or dying. Therefore, the plot twist is not such a great revelation, but does put everything in the proper context.Because the story is very open to interpretation (ie: is the action a product of a dying mind or are these experiences sort of a spiritual obstacle course?), you can watch the film repeatedly and still find plotting nuances to change how you perceive the story.IMO, the major changes Adrian Lyne made to the basic story were for the better. If you're interested in seeing how BJR's vision of angels taking Jacob to heaven might have looked (if attempted at all), rent 'Brainstorm' and watch the final couple of scenes. What is otherwise a good film is let down by these scenes and Lyne was right to go with his preferred option; Gabe leading Jacob by the hand up the stairs. Angels carrying Jacob to Heaven could never hope to be as grandiose as our own imaginations.If there is one particular fault with this film, the drug experimentation sub-plot doesn't seem to work. Even as a red herring, it's weak. On the whole though, I find 'Jacob's Ladder' poignant and thought-provoking.",Jacob's Ladder

Tim Robbins delivers an amazing character, we care for, worry for and be afraid with. The directing is also very masterful yet never more than what it needs be, keeping the viewers focus on the story, instead of fancy lights or film tricks.

Great acting, decent special effects (for the time) and some clever settings and camera work too.In all - a very clever film, I think it's one of my favourites.

Probably this is the only Adrien Line movie not so much about sex (although there is a bit in it), but through a wild exploration of someone who lost control of all his life and really longs to get it back. Jacob Singer is a nice guy. His Vietnam history has not changed that, but is a reason for weird nightmares, that get more an more real until he is no longer able to differ nightmare from reality. And inbetween there is always these flashbacks of the war... This movie is very well cut. The different stories all reveal more and more of the true background and the end is really astonishing and revealing all there is to answer.

I have seen this movie at least three times and after three viewings over a 17 year period, I have finally figured most of the movie out. I understood the meanings of most of the characters except for Loui the chiropractor...until now. Although everything we see(except for the scenes from NAM) is a hallucination, the character of Loui is explained. 1. In most scenes, Loui is always wearing white(his lab coat), 2. Once Loui helps Jacob from severe pain/slip disc, Jacob see's him as a savior, an angel. 3. Loui is always there to help Jacob in times of need. 4. It is Loui who makes the profound statement about letting go and the demons will become angels that help you. I believe Loui is depicted as an angel in this movie. True, 99 percent of this film is supposed to be the mind/brain of Jacob Singer working overtime before he dies, non-happenings, but we get a real perspective on how a man sum's up his life before he leaves this world. Some might say, How could he have dreamed this in a matter of minutes? He was stabbed by his own platoon soldier and shortly after(in the end) he dies.

That's a true nightmare, something that's still there after you blink.That said, the more mundane slice-of-life scenes in this film really breathe and make you wish they dropped the blatant horror elements altogether. The way director Adrian Lyne captures the grief, PTSD and generally dirty and dilapidated existence of Jacob is the strength of the film, as well as Tim Robbins who acted his off here.

232,darin-elliott,Wonderfully Well-Written,9,24 January 2006,"Warning - Major SpoilersLet me start by saying that I had to watch this movie four (4) times before I truly understood it. For some people, a movie this complicated can be horrible, for others, a wonderful experience.The movie starts with Jacob in Vietnam. He experiences a horrible fight one evening that we later learn was between the members of his squad. He manages to live through the battle and returns home. Back in the United States, Jacob returns to a ""normal"" life . . . for a little while. Then the demons start to appear, seemingly stocking him. He looks for solutions in various doctors and psychiatrists getting the whole ball rolling.At first glance, the events play out like a Vietnam vet experiencing some flashbacks and post-war stress. There are a few important keys to keep in mind though:1. Jacob is always going to the chiropractor for a stiff back. The chiropractor tells him that he should probably be stiff since he's dead.2. There are parts of his memory that are missing.3. Absolutely the most important part of the film is the very last scene where Jacob is being lifted into a helicopter and the medics are saying they are losing him.This all roles into one marvelous twist - Jacob actually died in Vietnam and the entire movie was a hallucination brought on by ""The Ladder"".

235,ramstar22,"""Ascending the Celluloid Ladder""",9,4 April 2005,"Is Jacob Singer dreaming? Is his life one giant nightmare? Is he simply hallucinating, suffering post traumatic stress syndrome form Vietnam? We don't know. But director Adrianne Lynn will show us Jacob's nightmare. He will take into the depths of one man's hell and in the process, attempt to explain poor Jacob's psychosis.Jacob SInger (Tim Robbins) returned from Vietnam different. He is now haunted by horrid visions of demons, strange entities and people who may or may not want to hurt him. He confides in his girlfriend Jezzie (Elizabeth Pena), but she cannot fathom the horror that Jacob is experiencing. He seeks guidance from his chiropractor (Danny Aiello), an old friend who holds some all too wise wisdom. And Jacob is still broken by the death of his young son. He still mourns despite seeming to begin a new life away from his old family (he is divorced). Yet when he is on the subway, he sees a man with what appears to be a tail. When at a party, he witnesses his girlfriend dance erotically with a winged creature. And then there are the faces, faceless beings that shake rapidly. Is Jacob crazy or did something happen in Vietnam? Jacob's Ladder is scary not because it is filled with gore. No one is eviscerated, maimed or disembowled. The true terror is psychological, touching the very core of what can disturb. We are not frightened, shielding our eyes from the screen, hiding in the shoulder of a significant other. No, we are unsettled yet mesmerized, astounded by what we are seeing. The most frightening images are the ones you can't look away from.Take for instance the scene with Jacob on his bed, grieving over the loss of his son. We see the desolate apartment, we hear the quiet and we feel his anguish. The fact that we see a man violently vibrate his body, howling and shrieking a horrible sound is off settling. That man is not supposed to be there. Jacob knows that. We know that. Yet the director, Lynn, knows this as well. And by incorporating an image so... unusual at such an abrupt moment, it shows us the level that the film has taken. Lynn is now able to do anything, show us anything. He has become the puppeteer not only of the characters but of the audience. When a director takes away your entire sense of reality, he becomes dangerous and the audience is more alone than ever.The ending is a matter of perspective and interpretation. One can look at it as closure. Another can look at it as a cop out: a display of cleverness. But everything that has been leading up to it has been exhilarating, a true showcase of the surreal. The fact is one cannot leave ""Jacob's Ladder"" normal. You just can't. The film requires too many emotions. It requires too much thought. Even for a person who admires the film, even likes it, I still cannot end the movie without feeling different: silent, perhaps cold, disturbed yet maybe even enlightened.This film could have not been made now. There is just no way that the quality would still remain, nor the genuine terror. Today, psychology has been replaced with cliché and story has been replaced with CGI. To think of truly great horror, none have ever been made post visual effects era. The fact that this film is not ruined by quick editing, over stylized cinematography and flashy effects is a testament to the time in which it was made. The dry, washed out color, grainy, gritty appearance and subtle, ambient score are all a credit to the late 80's, early 90's: an era where the practicality of effects added to the realism not detracted. Because of this, the story, plot and characters take over, a rare occasion in today's films.The brilliance of Jacob's Ladder arises form the film's ability to only show us the ""door."" The director describes it to us and only hints at what is behind. We, as the audience, are required to figure out what is truly inside and ultimately open it. The problem with modern genre movies is that the director opens the ""door"" for us. Why can't we choose to examine the ""door"" and only wonder what is behind it? Wy can't we decide if we want to open it or not? Well, in the case of the film, it is not a ""door"" but a ""ladder."" We have to decide if we want to venture up or down. For me... I ventured up.",Jacob's Ladder

This movie overall did not do this, it had me waiting for ""the big one"" , you know where something just scares the crap out of you, but when the film was over, I did not feel the void filled.

For anyone who has studied theology or mysticism, especially Gnostic or Christian mysticism, this film is a CANDY STORE of symbolism and mystical references.  Consider the title!  The beauty and art of the film is that it places cosmic and transcendental explorations that are present in the bible, Gnostic texts, & etc, and translates them into the context of the life of an ordinary man!  How much easier to relate to than the bible!  If you like mystical study, or theology, if you read the bible and found it dogmatic and sterile, WATCH THIS MOVIE!  It will utterly TRANSFORM how you view scripture and mysticism by placing it in the context of the ordinary... hopefully transforming the ordinary as well! Happy watching!-T",Jacob's Ladder

243,joshkaplan2,The Movie Silent Hill Wishes it Could Be,8,27 February 2011,"I had not seen anything by the director of Jacob's Ladder before, but I became interested through the IMDb reference page that said it was a major source of inspiration for the Silent Hill video game series, and the inspiration is clear enough to see. Misty/smokey halls, decrepit buildings, disturbingly deformed humans/demons, and the general tone that makes you doubt the narrator's sanity. But what was captured by the SH games much more than the SH movie is psychological aspect, the idea that our thoughts affect our environment more than the other way around. Jacob's Ladder also has a surprisingly happy ending for such a grim movie, but brings to mind the famous line by John Milton: ""Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light."" It's also telling that the working title of this movie was ""Dante's Inferno.""",Jacob's Ladder

The events had no link to each other and were really pointless. Just scary filler that was meaningless. The problem with this movie is that, in my humble opinion, the plot device used totally ruins the movie. The bulk of the movie itself is entertaining, but the ending is just a massive let down. I remember I was so mad after seeing the ending, because it was so simple and made all the movie's events and character development totally meaningless. Insufferably stupid ending ruined the movie.

A good director should be able to drive spectators through all kinds of emotions: that is an achievement of this Adrian Lyne's movie. Jacob's Ladder can have the spectator pass from total indifference through fear, expectation up to an understandable sorrow (so it accomplishes which is related to the basics of Greek drama). Alejandro Amenabar's The Others makes it the same, therefore Jacob's Ladder is considered one of its main influences and should be better known and voted.",Jacob's Ladder

You might argue it's different; I say, it's better! The movie follows a tormented soul (Tim Robbins) that's been apparently heavily affected by the Vietnam war. The directing is so good, you can't tell whether the scenes are flashbacks, dreams, nightmares or present. The imagery is especially staggering. The rumor on which the movie is based might not have any documented evidence, but I believe it couldn't have been presented in a more poignant fashion while keeping some balance. If, in the 1940's, I told that the U.S. government had 1000's of people working on a weapon that's supposed to be million-folds more destructive than any other bomb of the time, how many would have called me a conspiracy theorist?

But those last couple of minutes are worth waiting for, so don't leave the room!Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption) is wounded in Vietnam in a firefight but with peculiar circumstances. He is evacuated and next we see him working as a postal worker in the US. He's living with a Hispanic co-worker and there is talk between them about his ex-wife. After quite a while in the movie with his co-worker he wakes up one morning with his ex-wife and tells her how he had this strange dream that he was living with his co-worker. This is the first ""what the hell just happened"" moment and it gets weirder from then on. Evil things start to happen to him as he journeys in and out of spooky situations on what seems like the road to hell. At different times different groups seem bent on doing him in. His saviour on several occasions turns out to be his chiropractor. (I told you it was weird).Can't really divulge anymore without giving it away.

250,jester-22,A Masterpiece,10,25 January 1999,"Jacob's Ladder is a masterpiece.  When I rented this movie I was expecting a usual, run-of-the-mill horror movie.But what I got was something completely different.This movie is the story of Jacob Singer, a Vietnam vet who has a doctorate in arts, but works for the Post Office.  Before he left for Vietnam, he had a son die in an accident.  Now he's divorced and lives with one of his co-workers. Strange things start happening, though; he is soon having terrible flashbacks from Vietnam, and he is seeing faceless demons everywhere.At first he thinks he is losing his mind; but when his doctor and friend are killed in car bombings.  He begins to suspect that the Army had exposed him and his friends to something in Vietnam.This movie excels at making you feel what the hero feels.  When he is remembering his dead son, you can't help but feel sad with him.  When he is scared, so are you.  But this movie doesn't rely on jump scenes or cheap thrills.  It's more of a low-level psychological horror.  With one of the best endings I have ever witnessed in cinema.Some people feel sad or uneasy when this movie ends, others leave feeling happy or content (I'm one of the latter).  One thing you have to admit, though, is that this is a beautiful movie.",Jacob's Ladder
251,u-ziq,the 90's smartest nailbiter,10,5 November 1998,"Perhaps the best work from a director who has gone as far as a resurrection of Nabokov's Lolita to challenge the social norms of his medium, Jacob's Ladder weaves an oblique, demented and symbolic recreation of the moment of death. Criticized as muddled, inconsistent and full of extraneous footage, the film operates as the product of one split-second of imagination - a powerful and beautiful testament to the associative power of the human mind, and its link to the quasi-immortality of the human soul. Threaded through the surface of the dense epistemological and metaphysical parable is another gripping story about experimentation with mind-controlling chemistry in the Viet Nam war.  Lyne's masterful handling of the paralleled stories evidences his virtuosity.  Perhaps the brightest scene in the movie takes place in an abandoned rail car between Matt Craven (Michael, the chemist) and Tim Robbins (Jacob).  This dialogue is well-scripted and executed to near perfection.",Jacob's Ladder

His paranoia tears him into an hurricane of emotions, war, nightmares, monsters, tears, philosophy, shadows and chiropracy.The directing by Adrian Lyne (Lolita, 9 1/2 weeks) is fantastic and show manny things who later turned into stereotypes.

257,toneil,Amazing film that is much more than what meets the eye,10,4 December 2002,"I saw Jacob's Ladder as a young man when it first opened in 1990.  I remember liking it and being very intrigued by the film.  I couldn't exactly say why I liked it at the time; there was just something about it.  I have since seen the film numerous times and it has become one of my favorite films of all time.There are two reasons why I think this has happened.  The first reason is because the film itself deserves multiple viewings.  There is too much to take in with just one viewing.  I have noticed something different each time I have watched the film.  The film also speaks to the viewer on multiple levels.  The film can be seen as a psychological thriller, a conspiracy film and a spiritual odyssey all wrapped into one.  Many people have made the comment that this is one of the greatest ""horror"" films of all time but I actually don't see the film as a ""horror"" film at all.  I think you are really missing out on a lot if you fail to take in all of the religious symbolism in the film. This movie is packed full with a whole lot more than what we see on the surface level.  I also think that the ending is one of the most uplifting in cinematic history.The second reason why I hold this film in such high regard is because of the way it speaks to me as a person.  I liked the film as a young man but I love it now as a husband and father of three young children.  The torment that Jacob goes through after having been separated from his family and losing his youngest son can only truly be understood and appreciated through the eyes of a father and a husband. The director really draws you into the character of Jacob and his painful journey.  You really empathize with his loss, his guilt and his spiritual journey.                            **SPOILER** ** After just recently viewing the film again I noticed something I had never seen before.(I've seen the film over a dozen times) It appears  in the next to the final scene where Jacob is sitting on his couch and hears Gabe's music box.  If you look in the upper left hand corner of the screen you will see the top of a lamp shade.  As the light from the window hits the shade the shape of an eye appears. It looks as if the eye is looking down on Jacob.  I couldn't believe it when I first saw it.  I had to rewind it and ask a few friends if they also saw it.  If you have noticed this please e-mail me and tell me what you think.  I can't decide if this is a strange coincidence or another intended bit of religious symbolism.**",Jacob's Ladder
258,dsaliba-1,Haunting portrayal of the descent and ascent of the hero,10,5 March 2005,"First film that I am aware of that used a cinematographic technique of rapid and hyper movements (especially head shaking) to indicate ""other worldliness."" I was impressed. Another technique that impressed me was the hallucinogenic effect interspersed periodically to support the idea that the viewer is seeing through the eyes of the protagonist.The story did a great job of keeping the audience focused on the mysterious nature of the plot. The spiritual philosophy espoused by Danny Aiello's character resonated as a kind of mythological device that aided the protagonist on his terrifying and confusing journey. The device was a kindness (helping the protagonist to bear his crucifix) and a measure of hope for both the Tim Robbin's character and the audience.Overall, the movie did a wonderful job of portraying a man's decent into hell and his ultimate resurrection.",Jacob's Ladder

Moments of the film are almost an exact replica of my dreams and many moments are very surreal. The film is very strong and it keeps a steady pace throughout the entire two hour and ten minuet period. There wasn't a single moment that I felt bored at all. Tim Robins is fantastic as Jacob Singer, a returning Vietnam war vet who starts to lose his mind. Jacob starts to see demons throughout the city and the people he trusts are the people he should fear. Most of the performances in the film are strong, but the films weak point comes around the third quarter of it. Around the time Jacob starts to meet with his platoon members after the war, scenes with them felt very weak and forced. Besides that point of the film, it is very disturbing and very horrifying. I think I love the film so much because it reminds me of my nightmares, my nightmares aren't some dude with a knife chasing me through a house, mine make me feel helpless and scared.

It is simply the greatest horror screenplay ever written! And I guess this is a movie you either love or hate (my best friend constantly asked me during every scene change if this is a flash-forward, flash-back or flash-sideways, and for the record she hates the movie, but then again she's into soap opera level plotting/writing with plot holes so big you could drive a semi through them, so of course she wouldn't get it...sorry to sound snobbish, but there it is.) I have never had such a satisfying experience watching a film this complex. The fact that someone could create a complex horror film, TOTALLY void of cliché and predictability makes this film a true diamond in the rough.This is also the film that is the originator of the then highly effective, but now unfortunately overused, shaking head effect. When I first saw it I almost had a heart attack!! I had never seen anything so disturbing!! Then the film only became more unsettling from there!! This movie and story truly blew my mind...especially the meaning of the ending...ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!! Tim Robbins is AMAZING as the tortured Jacob Singer, and as a viewer, we can totally relate to his fears as we're as new to his experience as he is!

266,peacebst,The Litmus Test,10,28 February 2001,"*****SPOILER WARNING******SPOILER WARNING*******   Every once in a while, there comes along a movie that can split the public right down the middle.  Jacob's Ladder has that characteristic. Well, actually that isn't true, because I think a clear majority of the people would not enjoy this film.  It is horribly depressing (which turns off some), has a confusing and intentionally ambiguous plot-line (which turns off some more), it is dark and moody (which turns off even more), and it has an ending that some people just don't get.  Even though, unlike the Sixth Sense (which it is often now compared to), it blatantly and explicitly tells the audience through characters such as the Evil Doctor (not the chiropracter) and the black palm reader at the party, what is happening.
   They both tell him in no uncertain terms: you're dead.  Yet because of their characters, the latter being too amicable and the former being too hostile, the main character, and the audience, just can't believe them. Yes, the movie is disturbing, but to those that follow it right up to the end, watching not only the political and social comments the movie makes along the way, which are actually the weaker messages, but also the mystical insight the movie has to offer in its' conclusion, this movie simply could not be any better.     This movie is like anchovies, most people just can't stand them, but to those who do, nothing else comes close.  To some, this film is a masterpiece of visual, mental, and mystical entertainment.  This final aspect, mysticism, is only compounded by how rare this is in movies today.  Don't get me wrong, I thought Sixth Sense was a superb movie, but it does not try to tackle anything nearly as profound as Jacob's Ladder.  This probably explains the Sixth Sense's broader appeal.  Jacob's Ladder not only makes exceedingly deep statements about death and the afterlife, but about the nature of Good and Evil and the roles that they play in that afterlife. 
   The ""demons"" in this movie turn out to be Jacob's friends, the ones who are trying to get Jacob to realize the truth.  ""You've been killed, don't you remember?"" the ""Evil Doctor"" tells him just before the wonderfully symbolic action of trying to make an injection into his brain.  He protests and denies the notion of being dead, to which the doctor simply responds, ""What are you doing here then?""  Jacob is reduced to tears as he meekly replies, ""I don't know.""  When the needle is brought to his forehead, Jacob screams.  He cannot accept it in mind or body, and he views his tormentors as the enemy.     In the end, it isn't the government conspiracists, his girlfriend, or even his own platoon, that Jacob is fighting.  He is fighting with his own mortality in a struggle he cannot win, because the battle is already over. The movie unashamedly and bluntly delves into metaphysical morality with so many symbolic references and ruthless techniques that it becomes a roller-coaster that can overwhelm some and simply nauseate others. 
   To me: it was, and still is, after the umpteenth viewing, a psychological, visual, and moral feast.  A true classic.",Jacob's Ladder
267,Benji-26,PTSD or not PTSD,8,7 April 2001,"This film is featured in Psychiatry and the Cinema on the Priory site. Jacob Singer has flashbacks, recurrent nightmares, hypervigilance, irritability and other features characteristic of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He would seem to fit the criteria for Vietnam veteran PTSD, but there are some aspects to this story that make it more of a ghost story. In some ways this is a precursor to The Sixth Sense, because there is some doubt as to whether Jacob is really alive at all through the film. The PTSD explanation works well for the first 80% of the film, but he latter scenes imply that Jacob is only on earth as a lost soul.Resolving his psychological attachments and 'letting go' turns the demons of his existence into angels that convey 'upstairs' to heaven.",Jacob's Ladder

But also the it clever says that the drugs (given to the soldiers) are a ladder leading to utter madness.Some scenes are some of the most memorable I've ever experienced but in a sort of possessive way (for example, the mental hospital scene...damn that was scary!).

271,mike62481,Great Film ***Spoilers here***,9,23 March 2004,"***Spoilers here***This story focuses on a Vietnam veteran named Jacob Singer who is experiencing flashbacks in his present life.  He is losing his hold on reality, and nothing seems real.  These flashbacks of Vietnam horror are mixed with present and taking over his thought process.  He is having problems existing and remaining sane.  Ving Rhames and Jason Alexander have minor roles but are effective.  The real star of the film is Tim Robbins, who is excellent.  Jacob is a nervous wreck, and very vulnerable.  His character displays a great range of human emotions, and one is often questioning who is Jacob Singer; what is his identity??  It is blurred through the different symbolic characters that exist in his mind.  His women in his life:  his wife Sarah and Jezebel; his chiropractor, and his Vietnam veteran buddies.  Yet he is not set and committed to either one of these characters except two.  Firstly, he loves and misses his dead son, Gabe. He genuinely loves his son, and that love is what allows him to let go of the world and ascend up his own ladder to the afterlife.Secondly, he escapes to the character of Danny Aiello when he needs healin g and help.  Throughout the film, one is questioning the validity of what is really occurring.  Is Jacob dying?  Is he in a living hell?  Or is he just plain insane?  He cannot trust many people, except Louis (played by Danny Aiello) his chiropractor.  Louis reveals the truth of the film near the end: that Singer is in between heaven and hell and not letting his soul ascend to Heaven.  He has to let go and allow the angels to take him up to Heaven. Otherwise, the devils will perpetually stalk him and make his life a living hell.  The drug twist was an interesting curve that was effective, yet I am glad the movie did not end on that note.  It would have seemed an unnatural conclusion given Jacob Singer's experiences in the film.  It was not a nightmare, nor any dream or hallucination.  It was a true experience in all the sense of that word.  The events, characters, and manifestations that are shown in the film come from Jacob's mind in a sincerely truthful way. They all are symbolic of different aspects of Jacob's psyche.  It is like a dream; but dreams are not as symbolic as Jacob's experiences here.  It is much more than any dream. It is an altogether different form of reality. It is the place where reality seizes to exist.  It is the playground of one's own mind; dreamlike, yes, but not a dream.  The mind is of itself and creates images that are representative of his whole existence and being. His entire life exists solely in his mind at this point.  Physically, he is not on earth anymore, but in a type of purgatory of the mind. Essentially, the whole film is what he sees in his mind on his deathbed; the horror of death, the fear of hell and of staying on Earth when your place is in heaven.The ending features a great camera shot.  Singer is lying dead on an operating table and the doctors walk away from it wondering this man's name. This takes away from the uniqueness of Jacob Singer, the person.  It depersonalizes him.  Instead of having a peaceful, deeply emotional ending where he is walking to Heaven it ends on an impersonal, almost apathetic note, with a subtle hint of uncertainty.  It brings up a fundamental question:  what happens to someone when they die??  No one really knows and there will always be uncertainty.  Thus, one cannot be certain that Jacob Singer went to Heaven in this film.  If it had ended on the shot of him going up the stairs with his son, him ascending to Heaven would most certainly be true.  Yet, at the end, he is just one man who has died in Vietnam.  It is a cold and somber ending.  Though he is peaceful and dead, his ties to the world have been severed.  This is a great conclusion, for it takes it away from the personal nature of the main character and it focuses on the more significant question of what death really is??  To the rest of the world Jacob Singer has died and is just another dead body who is `done singing'.  Yet personally in his mind Jacob is going to Heaven and is sure of it.  I love how subtle this idea is brought up here.  The uncertainty of the 'undiscovered country' is a question that no one can answer-yet everyone asks.   This is a very compelling story, with a satisfying ending.  It also has a good number of curves along the way that give it good sustenance.",Jacob's Ladder

The ultimate awakening!!The movie traces the point of ignition of our pineal gland by the accent of the cerebrospinal fluid (Christ) up the 33 vertebrae (Jacob's ladder) to meet with the 12 cranial nerves (12 Disciples) and ultimately activate the pineal gland which is our eventual resurrection.This movie beautifully imagines the state of mind of a dying person who comes to terms with all the life's learnings, the rights & the wrongs of the entire lifetime (or even beyond).A must watch.",Jacob's Ladder
273,sergeslevin,A melancholic horror,9,24 July 2016,"Jacob's Ladder is a very rare psychological exploration of the human mind under extreme stress. A film that gets under your skin and stays with you for years after watching it. What's the secret formula? How were the creators able to accomplish such a smart movie that touches you to the bottom of your soul? I strongly believe the subliminal messages conveyed through very abstract and surreal imagery, as well as juxtaposing specific emotional moods - was what made it so impactful. The story itself is very moving and not for the light hearted. Can't really label it as a horror, thriller, or a drama. It's so unique that it deserves its own category: perhaps something like: Melancholic Horror. The story arc is poetic and the cinematography is extremely immersive. Not many other works came close to achieving this same sense of perpetual thought and reflection. Definitely a classic to be watched by the generations.",Jacob's Ladder
274,TheBryanWay,It's a shame Lyne and Rubin didn't team up again...,9,21 September 2005,"This is the kind of movie that is sorely missing from today's theatres. While numerous directors and writers (too numerous to count) are trying to take horror films in new, original, and relevant ways, Jacob's Ladder will stand the test of time as a cult film that is truly terrifying and goes the extra mile by containing both criticism of military politics and an incredibly dense emotional subtext, none of which overwhelms the final product.Current horror films take the concept of gore, jump scares, and soundtrack to the utmost extreme, sacrificing mood, tension, and restraint, which are the biggest assets to a horror film. Jacob's Ladder utilizes every tool in the horror palette that it needs while remaining true to its own ethos. The best scene to fit this example is the party, where one of the characters quite literally dances with a demon. In a more contemporary horror film, we would clearly see this demon, shots might be in slow motion to emphasize the sexuality in it, we would probably get creepy soundtrack music, the character in question would probably get torn apart, and at least part of the demon would likely be CGI. Instead, the demon is seen in flashes that are quite unclear, which gives the viewer the idea that what they're NOT seeing is more terrifying. The sequence takes place in real time with appropriate dance music in the background without sacrificing the sexuality and the meaning of what is happening; this gives it a more realistic feel to the viewer. All the visual effects are in camera, but never in the same shot as the protagonist, offering a distance that allows for interpretation; is what the protagonist seeing reality, or an illusion?This one scene (which is by no means a plot spoiler) is indicative of the technical, formal, and metaphorical mastery of this film. The explanations for what is seen in the film are critical without being overbearing and toe the line for believability while leaving space for interpretation. The mood conveyed by the film is consistently dark, darker than most any other film could hope to achieve. It's so dark, in fact, that a large majority of people were practically catatonic leaving the original cut of the film.This film fires on all cylinders; the directing, writing, acting, music, special effects, production design, message, mood, and tension are always kept exactly where they should be. Simply put, it's a dark masterpiece.",Jacob's Ladder
275,ash-78,A Wonderful Show,10,16 January 2000,"The movie is everything you could ask for in a beautiful story.  Tim Robbins plays Jacob Singer, a Vietnam vet who suffers hallucinations, haunting flashbacks, and gets into weird situations.  He is at the end of his rope. Jezebel, his girlfriend, cares very much about him.  This movie has a lot of symbolism in it, some that are so miniscule but so important that you miss it.  It's a movie that is rare and unique and makes you both smile and cry. By the end, you feel as if you were Jacob, wanting all the chaos to stop. The main key is Tim Robbins who plays Jacob, whether he's just doing what he does day in or day out or if he's crying you pity him.  The opening scene is very horrifying.  It takes you to Vietnam where the problem starts.  What I like about this movie is that each scene will end abruptly and suddenly your somewhere else, trying to make sense of what's happened almost like Jacob is.  One of the most heart wrenching scenes is after a party, Jacob is in bed shivering while Jezebel is telling him she doesn't understand what's happening to him.  She finds out he is running of fever of 106 degrees, with the help of some neighbors, he's put into a bathtub filled with cold water and ice.  He's crying and screaming but then we're taken back to Vietnam in a flash.  He also had a past with an ex-wife who threw him out when he employed at a post office after going to college six years for a doctorate. They had three boys but one dies and the fact continues to destruct Jacob throughout the film.  Confused yet?  Well, on the first viewing it is.  Butit's such a great movie that, you need to see it more then just a couple of times.  The beautiful ending, which I won't give away is so gorgeous, with the score and the acting, that you'll need to get a box of kleenex.  And don't be reluctant to see it because it's classified as horror, believe me the only horror that it shows is the reality, because if you miss this, you'll be missing out on one hell of a show.",Jacob's Ladder
276,varn8165,"good movie, but could be better",8,15 May 2006,"When I sat down to watch Jacob's Ladder, I expected to see a strange, disturbing film. I got what I asked for. Jacob's Ladder is my kind of movie, but I have one problem with it: the ending. After the first hour of the movie, you pretty much figure out that Jacob Singer is dead...at least I did. However, when this happens, I usually find that the ending is something that I did not see coming at all. I was disappointed to see that the ending was what I thought it would be. I was hoping for a big plot twist and for a large gasp of surprise, but all I got was ""yeah I knew that would happen"". With all the scenes suggesting that Jake is dead, such as the party scene with the palm reader, I expected a different outcome. Then again, maybe that is what the filmmakers were going for. ""Give them something they expect. They'll never expect that."" Overall Jacob's Ladder is a good movie with an excellent cast and intriguing story. I recommend it heartily.",Jacob's Ladder

It should be watched more than once, but leave some breathing time in between the viewings.  It is heavy.  People who don't like thinking movies, granted this isn't-technically-a thinking movie, probably won't like it.  The movie resolves everything, in a way.  The twists and turns as we travel through the abyss of Jacob's dying mind are astounding.  This movie presents a original, to this reviewer at least, package, and handles it well.

The relationships and characters feel personal, the story grabs you and only lets you go after the movie, and it's a rollercoaster of switching between laughing and feelings of dread or confusion. So much was condensed in this movie but it never felt rushed. The great thing with this movie, and in my opinion all great movies share, is it lives in the grey zone, it's neither black or white. This is a horror/thriller film but it's so much more than that, and that's why this movie is great. Expect yourself to go ""WHAT DOES THIS MEANN??"" and overthink every detail. The ending of the movie explains it all but there is still a lot to think about and unpack even after viewing it. Metaphor galore.",Jacob's Ladder
279,George_Bush,Brilliant!,9,19 May 2004,"SPOILER ALERTJacob's Ladder (1990) The opening scene in Jacob's Ladder takes place during the Vietnam War. A small group of US soldiers are joking around, but suddenly they are attacked by the enemy (apparently)! As the attack starts some of the GI's suffer from strange attacks and everything turns into chaos. Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) is wounded by a bayonet but we don't see by who and why. The rest of the movie revolves around this day and what really happened.Singer drops to the ground in Vietnam and we are taken to New York. The war is over and Singer has recovered from his wound and is now working as a postman even though he took a PhD before going to Vietnam. The reason: After the war he ""didn't want to think anymore"". He has left his wife Sarah, and now lives with his girlfriend Jezebel (Elizabeth Peña). Sarah and Jacob had three children together, but one, Gabe (Macaulay Culkin), was killed in an automobile accident before Jacob went to Vietnam.Jacob suffers from eerie attacks in which he is hunted by inhuman beings. At a party he has one of his attacks and he sees Jezebel dancing and having sex with a demon on the dance floor (looks like something from a hentai cartoon). One day Jacob receives a call from one of his old Vietnam buddies. He suffers from the same attacks, and he is convinced it's demons and he's going to hell. He is freed from his torment when his car blows up just after he and Jacob parted. It turns out that the whole platoon is suffering from the same attacks, and they believe that the army must have done something to them. They ask a lawyer, Geary (Jason Alexander), to take their case and he initially accepts.Now the movie turns momentarily into a government conspiracy thriller, because Jacob learns that his army buddies have abandoned the case and so has the lawyer. Jacob is pretty sure that the army has pressured them out. He is proved correct when he himself is forced into a car for a 'friendly' conversation with a couple of government thugs. Jacob fights them off and jumps out of the car. The landing hurts his weak back and he is taken to a hospital (after he has been robbed by Santa Claus, who steals the wallet with Jacobs only picture of Gabe). The movie is also known, as Dante's Inferno and we understand why when Jacob arrives at the hospital. This is my favorite scene in the movie  as if hospitals weren't scary enough There are limbs and blood all over the place and strange and deform people crowd the hallways. The Evil Doctor (deservingly credited as such on IMDb!) tells Jacob that he's dead. Louis (Danny Aiello) who is Jacob's chiropractic gets him out.Home again Jacob is contacted by Michael (Matt Craven) who worked as a chemist for the US army in Vietnam. He tells the story about The Ladder  a drug designed to turn soldiers into killing machines. The drug was first tested on animals and Vietcong soldiers with incredible and scary results  Jacob's platoon was the first US test subjects. They turned mad and killed each other! In this scene Lyne proves that the imagination is far better than any images when Michael tells about the drug testing  Michael never thought people could do such things to each otherEarlier in the movie Louis told Jacob (which is the essential quote of the movie):""Eckhart saw Hell too. He said: The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you, he said. They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and... and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth"".Now Jacob returns to the house where he lived with Sarah. His dead son, Gabe, comes to get him. Hand in hand with Gabe, Jacob walks up the stairs into the light. The demons have turned into angels and Jacob is in heaven! Now we are taken back to Vietnam where Jacob dies in a MASH unit  the doctors couldn't do anymore, but they notice how peaceful Jacob looks. The only REAL things in the movie was the first and the last scene  the rest was a dream/hallucination/divine interventionI consider this to be Tim Robbins best performance ever and Adrian Lyne's best movie  a somewhat overlooked treasure (not on the horror board where most have seen it). The brilliant score by Maurice Jarre and beautiful cinematography by Jeffrey Kimball (True Romance and Stigmata) creates the perfect mood and atmosphere for this thoughtful experience. The movie isn't filled with special effects  often they just hint what's going on and leaves the rest to the imagination. The fast motion head jerks are very powerful and the same goes for the scene where Jezebel's eyes turn black  a scene also used very effective in The Passion of the Christ. My rating: 9/10",Jacob's Ladder
280,airsoftaddict,Eerie... just amazing,10,13 May 2005,"I have been a fan of the Silent Hill game series for the PS2 for years. I read somewhere that parts of the games are influenced by this movie. I had to rent it just to see for myself. Right away, I noticed a certain place that is in the 3rd game, and if you have played the game you will get chills when you see how ""Jacob"" reacts to the same situations you have to react to in the game. It creeped me out, and at first I thought it was just gimmicky.This is one of those movies that is impossible to explain. You must see this movie to believe it. Even if you haven't played, or even heard of Silent Hill, this film will make you think a lot. I wish I would have watched this movie when I was younger... before I joined the Army and learned what can happen when you are government property.I rate this movie at a 10 because of the way it made me feel.

281,robherd,Fantastic Movie/One Problem,9,5 January 2006,"I definitely fall into the ""Loved this Movie"" category. It works on so many different levels--as horror, suspense, mystery, thriller, even love story. In fact, I don't think this movie could've worked nearly as well if you didn't actually feel for this guy (Robbins) wholeheartedly. You can tell that this guy really loved his wife and his child. That's a testament to Robbins' performance. As others have said, I think the movie makes complete sense: Everything in the movie that occurred after Vietnam never really happened. He is simply imagining/hallucinating/dreaming it all as he lay dying in Vietnam. That's not to say that some of those events that he dreams about didn't really happen; for instance, his son really has died and he is now remembering him. And he really did work at a post office and probably had a crush on one of the workers there (Pena), so he is imagining a separate life with her. It all fit very well for me. However, I do have one problem with my own theory, and it's somewhat small, but important in my opinion. If everything after Vietnam never really happened, how did he find out about ""The Ladder"" (Bad LSD) as he lay dying? In the movie, an ex-Nam buddy tells him about it back in the States. But if he never actually went home, he would never have known about it, being that one of his own soldier-buddies attacks and mortally wounds him in the jungle. My best rationalization for this is that as he lay dying, he overheard some doctors or military personnel discussing what the bad LSD had wrought. Jacob then transposes those conversations into his own dreamlike state, creating the character of the hippie LSD scientist who created it. Yet it seems as though we are meant to believe that the scientist (Craven) actually did create it. It's the one part of the movie, for me, that crosses the line between the two worlds (reality and dreamlike/nightmare) and expects us to accept it. I wonder if anyone else has the same problem with this one pat of an otherwise fantastic movie.",Jacob's Ladder

The story is viewed through the eyes of the main character, who is unable to maintain a single reality for any length of time. Sometimes reality is beautiful, sometimes it is terrifying, but it is always demanding something of him he doesn't know how to give. Is he paranoid? That would explain the delusional nature of his world. Is he trapped in some awful nightmare? Is his world insane because he's insane, or because he, alone, is sane?  Each ""world"" is so real, so convincing. What is real? What does it mean to lose your reality?Superb acting by Robbins and Pena.

286,stevryan,Proof of an underestimated director's gifts,10,13 February 2000,"Director Adrian Lyne has often been subject to criticism for having helmed material thought to be none other than commercial fluff (9 1/2 WEEKS, FATAL ATTRACTION, INDECENT PROPOSAL, FLASHDANCE), despite the enormous integrity his direction has brought to these otherwise maligned films.  It's very easy to attack a film's artistry simply because of the audience to whom it appeals, or even its overall success.  Because I've always had a great fondness for Lyne's direction, it pleases me to say that I believe JACOB'S LADDER defies the commercial formula for his other films and allows his gifts to be seen for what they are.Lyne's contribution to this highly visceral, extremely frightening metaphysical thriller allowed it steer clear of the more familiar, ""awe-inspiring"" presentation normally used to adapt screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin's works (BRAINSTORM, GHOST, MY LIFE, among others).  By keeping the film's supernatural manifestations grounded in three-dimensional reality, and none-too-visible, the film's impact remains implicit and allows the audience to use its imagination and ""find"" the fear in the film, so to speak.  Because of the suggestive approach, we are allowed to concentrate on the convincing performances, nuances, and merely the threat that these obscured images propose, rather than having it all spelled out for us.
Though the $40 million dollar film was actually considered a box-office failure at the time of its release, it has still managed to maintain a dedicated cult following to this day, which perhaps would not have been possible without Lyne's more unpredictable approach.  And given the film's beautiful cinematography by action-film lensman Jeffrey Kimball, Maurice Jarre's eerie score, and sincere acting, the film clearly deserves its status as a triumphant cult favorite.People seem to forget that Lyne has not only brought technical credibility to his work (what with gorgeous camerawork and clever editing), he has also managed to motivate his actors to give some of their best performances (this includes actors who were already established, such as Glenn Close in FATAL ATTRACTION, as well as those who were not taken as seriously until working with Lyne, such as Demi Moore in INDECENT PROPOSAL).  True, some of the material he has worked with is rather wanting, as things like 9 1/2 WEEKS, FLASHDANCE, FATAL ATTRACTION, and INDECENT PROPOSAL, may have started out as nothing more than big-budget exploitation films, but one cannot deny the respectability that Lyne has brought to them.Lyne is just as noteworthy as his other British commercials-to-Hollywood-transition contemporaries like Ridley and Tony Scott, Alan Parker, and others.  The fact that he saved JACOB'S LADDER from becoming a more sensationalistic, OMEN/EXORCIST clone is a testament to that.  What remains is a gripping, terrifying, well-acted and directed thriller whose success must be measured by the continual impact the film has to this day, and not by its initially questionable box-office figures.For others out there that have an affinity for this film, as do I, please pick up the loaded DVD Special Edition ASAP!

290,stillmeyou,"(""Spoiler"" alert) Here's what it is...",8,14 June 2009,"I have watched this movie quite a few times over the years, and there are some things I am convinced of. In summary, the whole movie is what takes place in Jacob's mind as he is dying from his wound in Vietnam.It is common knowledge that the mind does funny things when a person is dying. Everything we see in the movie does have connections with Jacob's life before he went to Vietnam, but his dying mind spun these different scenarios around with threads attached to reality kind of like, ""What would my life had been if..."" Take his second wife (some say wife, I thought it was just his live-in girlfriend). He worked with her at the post office, so he knew her before he entered Vietnam. Perhaps he had had unholy thoughts about this attractive woman when he was married to his first wife. Thus, the scenario spins out about what his life would have been like if he'd have ended up with this woman. I believe his son did die before he went into Vietnam, thus seeing him at the very end and his son walking him up into heaven when he finally accepts his own death. His divorce from his wife may have already happened before Vietnam, or may have been on the verge of happening while he was there. His dying mind wonders if she still loves him, or perhaps knows this already and therefore this is in his thoughts.He was bayonetted by one of his own troop members who was freaking out on whatever drug the food that they were previously eating was laced with. Thus, Jacob's dying mind tries to figure this whole thing out as to why his troop members freaked out like they did, leading up to one of them stabbing him in his drug-induced rage. Jacob sees his friend's face before he falls, and sees the man's shocked look and knows that the man was not in his right mind and didn't mean what he had done. His mind spins the tale of what would happen if he survived, how would this affect him and his friends and would they be able to fight this in court to bring the culprit (the army) to justice?Kind of like a feverish mind, he sees impossible things like demons and the ""shaking headed"" man. All from a mind that is slowly dying. We've all had a fever and had crazy dreams resulting from it. He even has a fever that almost kills him in these fantasies, tying in with his dying brain. Even though he keeps flashing back and forth between reality and his feverish fantasies, he deep down knows he is dying.Then at the end he finally does die, and is then at peace with his little boy he lost before.These are just some of the answers I've figured out from watching the movie many times.A great story.

295,progmetal,one of the best movies that i enjoy,9,20 February 2008,"Lots of people have said tons about this movie already on IMDb . i just wanted to say the surreal / mystery vibe to this movie is really haunting and stands the test of time. Not only is Tim Robbins great but EVERY single extra, background person, supporting actor are just fabulous! The director really got the best performances from all involved in this movie. Everyone did a great job, it keeps you guessing and thinking the whole way through and the storyline is great. If you haven't seen this movie do yourself a favor and rent / buy it now. It's very reasonably priced on DVD. Flashes back from Vietnam era wartime to the present but it is not necessarily a ""war"" movie by any means. All the camera work is awesome with a lot of different locations around the city. This script must have been huge because different stuff is happening all the time w/ lots of attention to detail.",Jacob's Ladder
296,djnano,Among the best movies ever dealing with consciousness and dreaming,10,23 July 2002,"It is difficult to review a movie of this caliber without revealing crucial details to a first-time watcher, but Jacob's Ladder approaches one of the best films I've ever seen to visually grapple with an individual's ability to experience reality and to be conscious of his own being.  Therein lies the true horror; Tim Robbins deftly shows a man pursued by his inner demons and who cannot cope.  Without ever quite knowing which version of his reality he's participating in, he begins to deal with his flow of dreamstates by victimizing himself- creating nightmares.  Adrian Lyne's skill as a suspense director with superb soundtracking (with a good deal of voice effects and ambient noises).  Set in an 70's-ish New York and in Vietnam, this movie has an excellent knack for transitioning the viewer from scene to scene, especially with the warmth of color tone.  I recommend seeing the original version before the Director's cut-  I've found the 'making of' also very valuable- and prepare to sit in awe for a few minutes when the film finishes.",Jacob's Ladder
297,Mustangjp,Simply Amazing!!! A lot more simple than it seems Very underrated,10,11 February 2005,"A lot of people don't like this movie because they believe it's too hard to understand. However, it pretty straight forward, it's simply a representation of what someones goes through before dying, and i believe quite strongly that it's pretty close to that. The whole movie is just a big nightmare and a mental fight for survival. There is many references to death throughout the movie. Have you ever had a dream where somebody you barely know was suddenly close to you, and in your dream it seems like you've known him forever, for example your cousin's friend might suddenly be your brother and seems like he's always been. That's what happens to Jacob's with with his girlfriend. It might seems that the movie skips from one point to another but don't all dreams do exactly that. If you have something bothering you, you might dream of it at night. Jacob's concern was his survival, The movie is simply a representation of dreams. You can relate to Jacob's mental struggles through your dreams. This movie is very underrated, I believe it is one of the best motion picture every created, it's very original, and it leaves you thinking for days, the author is extremely clever!! Almost flawless in my opinion, 10 out of 10!!",Jacob's Ladder
298,kash_is_good,This movie is really something special...IM NOT JOKING AROUND,10,25 September 2002,"Most people I suppose never see movies like these. Jacob's Ladder was a film made 11 years ago and it's the only scary movie that really made me jump out of my seat. I saw it 3 years ago and all the copy-cats need to stop because they never work to scare you. ""SPOILERS""...This is the first film to use that shaky head technique you see in other horror films and music videos. This is the only movie that does it right by presenting it in the most unexpected fashion possible. You see alot of upsetting things that only this movie can scare you with. Faces, weird looking, deformed looking faces. EYES suddenly changing color. I don't want to spoil everything for you but if you ever played the first Silent Hill game, you'll know what this movie is like. Kind of anyway.The movie is really difficult to understand the first time you see it, so if you like to know story, DARE I SAY WATCH IT AGAIN UNTIL YOU DO. You know why? This is the only movie that scares the living crap out of you the second time you watch it. Or third. Or Fifth. It all depends if you're scared of other scary movies besides this one. I'm not, and that's saying alot. The first time I watched this, I kept my closet light on for three nights. I asked if I could sleep in my parents room, but they wouldn't let me. When I went to bed, all I could think of was the disturbing images that stuck in my head. I'm not kidding. I felt like there was someone in my room that would show up in my face any minute I opened my eyes up...but it was all in my head. What I'm trying to say is, everything you see in this film affects you psychologically. It really messes with your head. It may take a week for you to recover. Even if you've never in your life been scared of movies. It might even take longer to repair the brain wounds you recieve, if you're scared of some movies. Or even longer if you're scared of all horror, suspense, thriller movies you've seen. That's what makes this film so special. You won't expect to have nighmarish things bouncing back and forth in your head when you go to sleep. That's something that I think most people will remember this film for. Also it's deep, find-it-out-your-self-story, that's sure to intrigue you for years to come, just like books like ""The Giver"". There so many different ways to view or understand this movie, I guess it all depends on what you think.Also the acting and mood is swell. It is completely orignal, it has a good sense of realism, even if the things you see in it is impossible. I recommend this movie to anyone, and I do mean ANYONE. Like I said, if you've never been scared of a movie your whole life, this one will change that. If you like to read books, and are a very open minded person, this is a great title to figure out at the end. Even if it means sleeping with a ""something"" figure in your thoughts, screwing up your brain functions...any cost, you must see this movie. Or just go on ahead and buy it. Period.",Jacob's Ladder

It's whole feel and direction was like nothing I have ever seen or felt before. The complexity of the story was nothing short of a miracle which left you wondering just where you were in every scene only to be enlightened  at the end. This movie must be one of the most under-rated movies of all time, it has everything a great movie needs. This is perhaps the reason why it has been somewhat overlooked since all great movies tend not to be geared to the commercial masses since these people do not understand the issues and thinking put into movies like this. For me this movie tackles life and death, It does it in such a way as to open your mind up to possibilities and does not just spoon feed you with someone else's theory. This movie is a thinking movie don't watch it to relax for a night, because this movie demands your full attention all the time.

301,postboy,confused?,9,21 August 2006,"It seems a lot of people have trouble with the drugs / conspiracy part of the narrative and how that fits with the central theme of Jacob escaping purgatory, some suggest it's a loose-end that is never tied up and should have been elbowed from the film and even that it's irrelevant. It's absolutely vital! On one level it's a classic slight of hand and in my opinion works very elegantly. It's ultimately not important what happened in Vietnam, who made the drug or what it was. It provides a rational explanation for his nightmarish experiences in his post-war 'life' - he can explain his nightmares and visions as a hangover from the drug experiment. It does exactly what its supposed to, you are supposed to see things through Jacobs eyes and miss all the obvious signs as to what is really happening. In storytelling terms Jacob needs a reason to ignore or misread the signs and the hallucinatory aspect of the back-story provides a perfect cover. It also provides an engaging narrative for his post-war 'life' - a reason to search for answers. Without this aspect of the story we'd be left with a post-war vet having nightmares - just like all the rest - it would be too easy for him to simply accept this as a the norm, and without his questioning the journey of discovery ceases to exist.",Jacob's Ladder
302,ILoveFelicityJones,I'd been waiting to watch a movie like this for a long time,10,27 June 2014,"I'd been waiting to watch a movie like Jacob's Ladder for a very long time, I thought the premise behind Jacob's Ladder was exponential, a man who die's and his life is taken away with illusions and memories examined, and the difference between reality, what's real and what's not is frequently at hand in the audience's mind. These idea's are perfectly directed by Adrian Lynne. This movie show's us the deep intimate value of this Jacob's life, contrastingly it also show's us how he is just another dead soldier who is almost nobody to any one else and will be forgotten by all except maybe just a few people who knew him well, but to even them this deeply personal man's existence still disappears as really only one man lived as Jacob Singer, Jacob Singer. The writing in this movie could've been a little more well developed, however the direction and premise is perfect so this movie deserves a perfect 10 out of 10. I wanted to write a movie along the line's of the premise of Jacob's Ladder, it was inspiring to see the premise I had on my mind on screen.

305,andrew-rigby,A much maligned and misunderstood movie,10,26 January 2007,"I am directing this comment at the reviewers (amateur and professional) who, when writing about this film, refer to Jacob Singer as experiencing ''flashbacks''.Yes, OK, he DOES experience some flashbacks but these are only layers of the nightmare he endures.He is mortally wounded - as we remember - at the start of the film and then, as he fights for his life on the operating table, his tortured subconscious reveals to him what life will be like should he survive. His mind has been scrambled by the chemist's powerful drug and despite his comatose state, he learns life will constantly be a battle against powerful demons who are, in the words of his chiropractor, ''tearing him apart''.Thus, the aforementioned chiropractor says the demons could really be angels coming to set him free. And at the end of the film he IS set free by his dead son who takes him upstairs into the light.Yes, the first time I saw the film the last scene in the field hospital made me sit up in a ''what did I miss?'' kind of way. But please reviewers, take the time to work it out and cut out the flashback references from now on hey?

The every-day-life quality of the script along with the naturalness of the characters makes the creepy scenes very unnerving.

Normally, film reviews discuss the basic plot of the movie and then the reviewer gives his (or her) opinion of it all, but this film requires so much more. ****SPOILERS ALERT**** It is clear that Jacob is in a struggle to hold on to his life and as Louis puts it so simply ""devils are tearing his life away"". The film is filled with religious overtones that can be related to the biblical names of its characters. There is the constant tug of war between the ""angels"" and ""demons"". For example, when Gabe says to Jacob ""don't go"" (after he tucks him in bed), this symbolizes Gabe's reluctance to let go of him and succumb to the demons. Other scenes give further insight to this and most involve the angel like figures such as Gabe, Sarah and Louis. But even the demon like figures such as Jessie (notice how she only wears black throughout the movie) is reluctant to let Jacob go. They want him stuck in this purgatory until he is able to make his peace. This explains some of the religious aspects but why the hallucinogenic theme? In my opinion, there may have been a case in the past when these types of experiments were ACTUALLY conducted on military personnel. We will never know but the logic of it all makes it frighteningly plausible. And all of this makes more sense when you watch closely the transitions between Vietnam and the ""flash forwards"" and ""flashbacks"" as they are exquisitely related. For example, when Jacob imagines himself getting into the shower with Jessie, it is actually raining in the jungle at that precise moment. When he falls to the floor during the party, the soldiers are attending to him. When he catches fever, he is actually catching rheumatic fever as a result of the severe wound he suffered. And most importantly, what sheds light on why there was the whole hallucinogenic overtone is when he is actually getting stabbed. Notice the confused look on his face when he realizes one of his comrades has stabbed him. To him, the whole chaotic scenario preceding this event and the actual betrayal by one of his own could have only been caused by some behavior modifying drug ""the ladder"". This is why this theme is (to a certain extent) based upon in his hallucinations... he is trying to find a logical explanation as to why this happened. Of course, this is only my interpretation of the film. In any case, when you combine the religious, philosophical, and real life aspects this film encompasses, I am not sure we will ever see something like this ever again.",Jacob's Ladder

319,dklym,In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum.,10,8 November 2001,"**********( SPOILER )**********
""In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum. Jacob wrestled the angel. And the angel was overcome."" ~ U2's Bullet The Blue Sky, from Rattle and Hum, 1990.
Jacob's ladder. ""Before long his grasp on reality disappears, more than the room starts spinning and he careers down 'Jacob's Ladder' - a series of nightmares caused by chemicals tested on him by Uncle Sam twenty years earlier."" ~ Review by Dave Pallin, Taken from EUFS Programme 1993-94.
This movie is a nightmare of confusion, ambiguity and deceit echoed by the film's atmosphere. However, when stripped down to the lowest common denominator, 'Jacob's Ladder' is about a Vietnam vet injured in the field. Jacob is stabbed by a bayonet. Thus, the movie's real-time setting is established for the viewer. While the present is happening behind the scenes where Jacob drifts in and out of consciousness, we soon realize the multi-layer sub plots of his relationships is where the movie really takes place and wants us -- the viewer, to reside. Here, in the mind of Jacob is the action, conflict, confusion, and eventual resolution. Meanwhile, on the surface of the real-time plot, Jacob is found as he lay wounded, and then transported by gurney to a MASH unit where he eventually dies after his last breath effort to reclaim his life through the salvation of defining inner peace for himself.Meantime, we learn that Jacob has three children (Jed, Eli, and of course, Gabriel who was killed in a car accident before Jacob's life in Nam).Once married to a loving and beautiful wife named Sarah, Jacob's real horror seems to be the relationship he experiences with Jezebel:Jacob: You're such a heathen, Jezzie. How'd I ever get involved with such a f***in' ninny?Jezebel: You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.Jacob: Yeah? For what?Jezebel: A good lay.The real mystery to the movie from my perspective is the ambiguity of this relationship between Jacob and the jezebel... of Jacob and the forbidden apple... the fall of the Garden... of Man's supposed sin. Whatever you wanna call it, it's sexuality and tension at work. Is Jacob and Jezebel's relationship nothing more than fragments of a past relationship that destroyed a marriage before Nam that becomes entangled in his quest for clarity, tangibility, and reality? Jacob desperately wants to wake up from his nightmare. Or is this a fantasy that Jacob had and continues to manufacture in his mind and too gets entangled within the web of his consciousness? However interpreted, it does appear to be the symbolic pit of damnation that has enveloped Jacob throughout the film.Eventually, Jacob does find the light. Is it Gabriel's light -- the light of an angel? Or is it the operating table tent light of the MASH unit -- the light of reality and real-time? Or is it a little of both? Regardless, Jacob has finally ascended the ladder out of the mirage of chemical drugs and government politics, plotting, and deceit into a world of family, familiarity, and serenity.Guided by the voice of reason -- Louis (the chiropractor), Jacob seems to be anchored and grounded in these scenes. This is symbolic of his spine being realign... Being set back on track to stand upright on his own two feet. These scenes are filled with sincerity and trust. Lots of backbone here. *smile*Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that in the movie we also learn that Jacob is a letter carrier/mailman. Seemingly an under achiever, the postman is similar to George Bailey (from Frank Capra's, 'It's a Wonderful Life' fighting the battle of Bedford Falls). Both find their salvation in their own backyard. Dorothy had the ruby slippers, George had Clarence and a somewhat rip-off version of Charles Dickens', 'A Christmas Carol.' And Jacob has Louis & Gabe to take him back home to... Kansas? Bedford Falls? Back home to the arms of Sarah. Family does become the symbolic ""Return to sender"" in the end.**********( END of SPOILER )**********And the entire irony is the fact that Macaulay Culkin (Gabe) is uncredited in the movie, and deserves recognition for his best performance to date.One ""Hell"" of a good movie. No pun intended *smile.*

You can see the roof, which looks like grating, like in the insane asylum scene where Jacob is being wheeled on the gurney. Above him he sees similar grating and some strange people/things. For James, one can say he's also being wheeled on a gurney and similar sounds are heard.Monster Framing --------------- The monsters in frames, or cages, if you will, are another reference to the movie.

The cage monsters in this game include the Hangers (boss), the Mary/Maria Demon, and the hanging corpses in Pyramid Head's Labyrinth Lair.head Twitching -------------- The twitching heads of the Patient Demon and the final boss, the Mary/Maria Demon is probably a reference to the movie, as this can be seen in certain Jacob's Ladder scenes.

I think you could waste time trying to figure out the exact significance of every little piece of this puzzle, what's important is to just let it wash over you, you'll find new little nuances every time. That voice; ""dream on"" gets more disturbing every time you think a bit harder about what it means, and see Robin Williams face when he hears it...",Jacob's Ladder

When people are asked about this masterpiece, they think of me as one of those artsy snobs that comments about avantgarde movies that no one has ever heard of, except for the director himself. Jacob's Ladder is very mainstream kind of movie, with the exciting plot and beautiful visualization, plus excellent acting. You can watch it for several times, go through its complex layers, and I guarantee you'll never get bored by it.

I watched this film when I was about 17 when it came out, I didn't really grasp the full meaning of the tale then. Since then I have seen it a few times since. I understand the plot a lot more, and I still love the film. I don't go for gore, or psychological horror (thriller), prefering something more supernatural. This film actually does the psychological horror with hints of the supernatural, in my opinion, very well. Its also cleverly thought out and brilliantly acted. I'm surprised not more people remember it, I thought it was destined to be a classic and I still (2006) recommend it to those I know, who haven't seen it. It creates an emotional empathy with Jacob as he experiences his pain, confusion, demons,flashbacks, and an good deal of suffering, that is rare in such a film (the empathy is the rare bit). Not sure if it really fits into a ""typical"" genre, although is better for it.",Jacob's Ladder

A commercial came up introducing the movie, and being my type of movie, I said to my wife we should check it out on opening night at the theatre. I was glued to my seat from start to finish as there were so many twists and turns, you didn't know where the movie was headed. When they flashed,the closing note at the end of the movie about the drug BZ, a large number of people in the theatre were shocked. Not about the drug, but about the fact the story never really took place.Jacob Singer was lying on the operating table in a trance, halfway between life and death, and none of the story or movie actually even happened. A guess it comes down to the stories about the supernatural and the journey between life and death. A great piece of original filmwork by a genius director.",Jacob's Ladder

Another factor is this movie is the type of movie that makes one think. What is particularly interesting about the idea of experimentation brought up in the film, is that I have actually learned a lot about the government experimenting on people in the past as part of my education of ethics in experimentation with people. To my shock and horror the government really has done very unethical experimentation on unwilling and unknowing candidates (such as the Tuskegee experiments).

I believe that the secret of a good story is its ability to surprise us, leaving the solution to the last possible minute. Jacob's Ladder makes us wonder what is happening all over the movie, but solves the mystery, entirely, in the last seconds (leaving very few clues throughout the film about what really happens). Many movies have a good story, but unfold it confusedly, and the end doesn't tie all the strings. Just for that Jacob's Ladder deserves a position as one of the best movies, as it excels in storytelling. But there is much more. It's horrifying in its images, disturbing in its ideas, but liberator in its central concept. Reflecting about the message the movie passes, I have two opposite feelings: one of wonder, the other of sadness. Wonder for the greatness of life, but sadness for the conscience that we will never understand it completely. Jacob's ladder comes from the Holy Bible, in the book of Genesis: a ladder from which angels and people can transit between Heaven and Earth, appearing in a dream by Jacob. Through the movie, this name means many things, and is another testimony to its brilliance.",Jacob's Ladder
338,supernovaa-925-314424,A dark and surrealistic messenger of hope.,9,20 December 2010,"Adrian Lynes finest hour and a movie that differs considerably from his other work. Its not a pure horror movie because the plot is not simplistic enough. As a viewer you really doesn't know what it is that haunts Jacob. No defined threat appears. I guess its fair to place the movie in the space between the horror and thriller genres.The strengths of this movie are many. The story deals with the journey between life and death of a Vietnam casualty. As the story progress you understand that there must have been some government testing of psychotropic drugs involved and Jacob start to search for other veterans in his old battalion. Frightened and alone he want answers and to share experiences.As a film-maker building the story round a complex chronological time-frame always comes with a certain risk. Will the audience remain concentrated and keep interest for 90 minutes? The magic is not to overdo it and Mr Lyne uses the chronological jumps masterfully to create a sense of floating uncertainty in the story that blends very well with Jakob's haunted persona. Unabel to come to rest due to his escalating nightmarish experiences.Something could and should also be said about the special effects. No CGI in this one. And there are some scenes in the film that benefits hugely from this. In particular the hospital scene when Jacob passes through the corridor to hell lying in a hospital bed. The flesh and the individuals with foreshortened limbs that lines up on him are there for real creating a horrifying and disturbing impression. The dance-floor scene filmed in stroboscopic light when Jezzie appears to have sex with something that looks like a demon were made using life-size models and shot in real time.Some think Tim Robbins finest moment were in Shawshank redemption and maybe it was but i certainly can't think of a better choice to put Jacob Singer alive. Mr Lyne wanted Robbins boyish innocence, and innate joy in existence to play against the darkness of the character's gradual unraveling. And it works tremendously well. Elisabeth Pena as Jezzie is also convincing and Danny Aiello shines, as so often, in his minor part.The ending is superb and adds greatly to the overall impression. It puts an end to Jacobs misery and gives the answers the viewers have been waiting for. But the film also raises questions, some of which lives long after the after texts ends. Universal questions about our existence and what happens at the end.This is one of my all time favorites. Intelligent, philosophical and grand. Bravo Mr Lyne.",Jacob's Ladder

340,nanashi_kuroshima,WARNING: This film requires a brain.,10,25 March 2004,"THERE ARE SPOILERS CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING VITRIOLIC RANT. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. Jacob's Ladder is a fine film. It's easy to see why the vast majority of the movie-going public might have difficulty understanding this, however, as the film contains only two explosions and there is no soulless explanation of EVERY SINGLE BIT IN THE FILM for our less adroit friends.The fact is that you need to think whilst watching this film. I'm sure most people dislike Jacob's Ladder because they started reading a review, got as far as the word 'Vietnam', and wandered happily into cinemas expecting Chuck Norris to kick some Viet-Cong kid's heart out of his back. Needless to say, they would have been sorely disappointed when they were blindsided with a bit of story, and it's this feeling of illiterate pique that has stayed with them. Here's the story in a nutshell, for those who would have preferred Tim Robbins to have turned into Jean-Claude van Damme and blown up a helicopter: Jacob Singer's nightmare is just that - a nightmare. He was mortally wounded in Vietnam whilst under the influence of a mind-altering drug put into his food by the army. Unwilling to accept death, his mind constructs an alternate world in which to hide. The world is populated by demonic monsters and angelic chiropractors because of the way Jacob's mind works - he's a theology professor. His whole world is a construct (a bit like the Matrix, for those who are having difficulty following this), interspersed with brief glimpses of the real world, where he is dying. It's only when he is able to accept his own death that he is able to find peace. His enemy all the way through was his own mind and his own fear. When you look at it that way, there's really no room for an oily man in a vest, is there? This film is, unfortunately for fans of Jerry Bruckheimer, a drama with a vaguely ambiguous plot and a character-driven story.Those two explosions should go some way towards fixing that for the popcorn-snorting movie morons, tough, shouldn't they?",Jacob's Ladder
341,alecentauro,One of the most terrifying movies ever seen,10,1 June 2013,"There are a couple of facts to take into account to understand this movie: 1. You will be much more likely to understand it if you are familiar with Christianity. Careful! I don't mean being Christian yourself, (I am an atheist) but knowing something about Christian believes.2. In order not to make this an spoiler, I highly recommend to read about the interpretations of the bible verses referring to Jacob's ladder, which you can find elsewhere in the net.Having said that, the film is one of the most bizarre and and creepiest chain of events I have ever witnessed, with some very well placed portions of ""nothing happening"" filled of quibbling only in the light of those attentive.Having some particular knowledge about some of the Christian interpretations of life and dead, will show you that at the end, there is very little left to interpretation in this movie.A master piece of terror indeed, but probably for a very selective audience.",Jacob's Ladder

The storytelling is very balanced & articulate, conveying the emotional life of Tim Robbin's character and the perceptions of reality he must contend with. It accomplishes what most horror films set out to do in the first 30 minutes, and then continues to weaves a vivid and evolving story for another hour and a half. Certain visual motifs rocked me to my core, vivifying the ancient function of drama anew. Man, resonance on so many levels. The main themes seem to be the fear of the ephemeral, paranoia & longing, uncertainty as to what is real. Perfect for the renewal of spring, after winter's dreaming :)",Jacob's Ladder
343,woltjer4,Superb film in every way,10,13 May 2005,"I have seen this movie several times and will see it several more times. It is one of the few DVD's I own. It is a mesmerizing, dark, reality twisting look into madness; a constantly shifting discourse on what is real; a gut wrenching foray into the effects of tampering with the human mind to create more effective soldiers. This film, though not easy to watch is one of the most riveting, compelling, challenging films I have ever seen. And to top it all off, the last 2 minutes of the film turn the story on its head in a way that could not have been predicted.Throughout this film I was asking, which of the ""realities"" that Singer is living is the real one? Each one is convincing, and shifts you out of your previous interpretation in a most convincing way. And then again, it shifts back convincing you once again that the previous reality was the illusion. His final meeting with his young son (Macauley Caulkin) is wrenchingly beautiful and brings a measure of peace to a film that unrelentingly shocks, jars, and assaults you. And then the final scene, The,""Oh my God, what does this mean"" moment compels a second, third and fourth watching. This film is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. If you love ""You've Got Mail"" you'll hate this. But for a movie that will make you think, make you ponder the meaning of life, challenge you to grapple with ""reality"" there are few finer cinematic experiences.",Jacob's Ladder

346,pham03,Hallucinations and visions of demons and a secret organization who is trying to capture him,8,28 July 2014,"Jacob's Ladder is not an easy movie to watch. There are a lot of details and flashbacks that is incorporated into the story line. The movie has a mystery/thriller/horror based theme and can easily be distinguished. The movie Jacob's Ladder stars Tim Robbins as Jacob and Elizabeth Pena as Jezzie. He is a Vietnam War veteran dealing with everyday life. After years of coping with the death of his child, he finds a picture of his child and that is when everything starts going downhill. After his failed marriage and the death of his young son, he finds a job at the United States Postal Office and meets a woman, Jezzie, there who helps him through his issues. Jacob starts to have hallucinations and visions of demons and a secret organization who is trying to capture him. From the hallucinations, he can't telling from what is distinguish the real or the illusions. He starts to see faceless men and with the help of his unit from Vietnam, they come to the conclusion that they are all having the same visions and believe that they were experimented on, but have no proof. His previous doctor and close friend from his unit both die in a car explosion after trying to figure out why they are having those visions. After being captured by men whom he believes is the organization that his behind the hallucinations, he fights them off and manages to jump out of the moving vehicle and is transported to what seems to be a mental hospital. When fully realizing where he is, he is tied down and is experimented on. Right before the procedure, Jezzie appears and is helping them out with the procedure. Jacob then awakens in his apartment and fights with Jezzie because he does not know if she was really lying to him or if it was just all a dream. After talking to his chiropractor Louis, the scene changes to the Vietnam War where is having a lifesaving surgery, but does not survive. The ending titles informs the viewers that drugs were being tested and used on soldiers at the time, but the government denies the accusation. I find this movie to be a lot like Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind. Both movies are really hard to understand until the very last scene and have a lot of little details that work into the movie. The lighting in the movie is dark throughout the entire movie and there is not too many scenes where there is a lot of sunlight. The only scenes where there is sunlight is his flashbacks to his memories with his ex-wife and child. This movie is a really great film if you are wanting to watch a mystery thriller with a hint of horror. It blends in all three genres really good and there are many familiar actors scene throughout the movie that brings the movie to life.",Jacob's Ladder

No offense to those who do not...:) Now, my review is based on the following: you will not see greater acting done in any movie, the attention to detail is astounding, and the directing excellent. However, let it be known, that the strength lies in (as always) the astounding manuscript. This is, simply put, an amazing story. Some people may be fooled into thinking this is some kind of ""horror flick"", but let me assure you, it is not! It is a story of love, hope, dreams, life, death, and ultimately: the final deliverance.As I will not go into the details of the actual story, just take may word for it (and others on this forum I'm sure): see this movie!!!

The only thing I have to add about Jacob's Ladder is this: How often do you watch a film and get to the final scene, and say to yourself ""My God...is that what was really going on here..."". You then feel absolutely compelled to re-watch the entire film, to re-evaluate its entire substance and comprehend the imagery and symbolism that you are now acutely aware that you missed in your first viewing.How often does that happen to you?I really didn't want to say more than the above text, but IMDb requires more comments so here goes. Some of my favorite scenes are: - Jake's first train ride (incredible symbolism); the scene where Jezebel has a dance with an unexpected dance partner (so full of Old Testament imagery); any scene with Danny Aiello (why didn't he get an Academy Award nomination?); the final scene (re-wind and watch again!)",Jacob's Ladder
352,tonyh-23343,What is really happening,10,19 September 2017,"What can I say, this is one of the best films ever made and the ONLY film I've have had to watch again immediately after it finished. It was after this second viewing that I finally got what was going on.The whole film hinges on what's real and what Jacob is imagining. All the way through you think reality is the parts of the film that are set in what appears to be the present, with Jacob holding down a job and having scary visions of demons, and that the 'flashbacks' he keeps having about Vietnam and being on the stretcher in the helicopter are memories. Then, at the end, BOOM you realise reality is that he's on the helicopter and he's dying. He's clinging to life, drifting in and out of consciousness, trying to fill in a life he imagines he would have once he returns home after the war. The 'demons' he sees are because he hasn't made his peace and he feels guilty about the death of his son. this is perfectly summed up by Danny Aiello's character Louis when he says: ""The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you, he said. They're freeing your soul. So the way he sees it, if you're frightened of dying and... and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth. It's just a matter of how you look at it, that's all. So don't worry, okay? Okay?"" It takes the spirit of his dead son to come and tell him it's OK and he doesn't blame him to enable him to make his peace and let go.Totally blew my mind when I saw it all those years ago, and remains a completely underrated film in my view. See it!",Jacob's Ladder
353,slytheclaw,Really just boring,3,2 September 2018,"It seems that most of the people who rated this movie poorly found it to be confusing. I had the opposite experience. I found the movie to be incredibly dull because I had figured out the ending twist 15 minutes in. 
Spoiler Warning
In the end, it is revealed that 95% of the movie was just Jacob's dying hallucinations, and he was still in Vietnam all along. If you have seen a movie with a twist ending before, then you should be able to figure this out pretty quickly. After this realization, the whole movie becomes a bunch of pointless scenes with no stakes. Another thing that is presented as a twist is that the Americans were killing each other instead of the Viet Cong, but the first question I asked when I watched the movie was ""Why are the Americans killing each other?"". We find out that is was because the military was testing them with a psychotropic drug. I suppose this is the one mystery in the movie that wasn't plainly obvious at the beginning, but it also wasn't that interesting when you realized that the whole search for answers was just part of his hallucination. 
Overall, this is a movie that requires you to be surprised by and to appreciate the twists it throws at you. If you aren't and don't, then it's just a slog of dull events with a color palate to match.",Jacob's Ladder
354,gubrud,a movie with an identity crisis,5,25 February 2006,"If a veteran haunted by bad memories wrote a story about survivor guilt and how bad it was in the 'Nam, and it fell into the hands of an anti-war liberal who wanted to turn it into a political thriller about military experiments with hallucinogenic drugs, and if he ended up working for a corporate studio that wanted to turn it into a cross between Exorcist-style horror and family-friendly Heaven flicks, this is what it would end up looking like. Although artfully directed and effectively unnerving, Jacob's Ladder tries to say so many things so half-heartedly and confusedly that it ends up saying nothing clearly and coherently.Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) has somehow survived a bayonet gut wound and is now living in New York as a postman. But he really should know better than to leave his blonde wife and kids for a black-haired, foreign-accented shiksa named Jezebel, particularly when she has a large scar on her right breast just where Jacob should have one. Weird things begin to happen, which combine with harrowing combat flashbacks to make Jacob feel he is going insane.Although ""Dr. Singer"" is clearly a complex character, we never learn much about what made him who he is, apart from the Vietnam experience and the loss of his young son. We never learn why he left his wife, who seems to still love him and who he dreams of returning to. The political subplot creates a tension between fantasy and reality, but ultimately feels like a distraction from the personal. The final plot resolution is both unsurprising and unpredictable, given the confusion of themes in the movie, and leaves us feeling we've just watched a two-hour episode of the Twilight Zone.",Jacob's Ladder
