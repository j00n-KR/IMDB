0,MartinHafer,I must be getting old....I was more concerned about the lack of air conditioning than about the murder and sex.,8,28 August 2021,"This story begins with a lawyer, Ned (William Hurt), who seems to think mostly with his second brain. When he meets Matty (Kathleen Turner), he immediately learns she is married but he doesn't care as his second brain is doing all his thinking. Soon the pair are engaged in a very passionate affair and over time he decides to kill the husband so he can have her AND she can have the husband's money. However, after he does the evil deed, it becomes more and more clear that Matty planned all of this long before she met him. And, he isn't sure what her plans are now...but they might not include him.In so many ways, this film is like a sleazier reworking of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" and ""Double Indemnity"", which is itself a reworking of the Émile Zola novel, Thérèse Raquin. The main difference is that this film is more sexually explicit...though not as much as I had expected. In fact. For years I avoided the film because I thought it was just a soft core porno movie...which it turned out not to be. Yes, there's quite a bit of skin...but the story itself and the acting are quite good and so there's much more to the story. Well worth seeing...but certainly a rather adult story, so I wouldn't recommend you watch it with your mother-in-law OR Father O'Malley.By the way, I must be getting old. I didn't care much about the nudity in the film and instead I kept thinking ""I have lived in Florida for two decades and why don't the folks in this film have air conditioning.... EVERYBODY in Florida has air conditioning. Plus, Matty is supposed to be rich....so why no air conditioning?!"".",Body Heat
1,Leofwine_draca,Decent mood piece,5,22 December 2012,"BODY HEAT is all about the mood. It's a film that makes you shuffle and sweat as you watch, set as it is in the searing Florida heat. In all other respects, it's a classic film noir that harks back to the movies of yesteryear in which a mismatched couple embark on a torrid affair. What follows involves murder, double-crossing and more passionate embraces than you can shake a stick at.While I found this film mildly enjoyable, I felt throughout that I'd already seen it in the same year's THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE. In addition, I thought the Nicholson film was better: more characterisation for a start, and a more engaging plot. Try as I might, I just couldn't warm to either William Hurt or Kathleen Turner in this film, although the always underrated Richard Crenna puts in a nice turn as Turner's husband.There's some good plotting here, some well directed scenes and decent twists, but I never got emotionally involved with what I was watching. And that's what it always comes down to, for me; my enjoyment of a movie depends on how far I can get involved in it. With BODY HEAT, I never forgot I was watching a film.",Body Heat
2,SnoopyStyle,Pushing Noirs to New Heights,9,19 February 2014,"Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a small seedy lawyer in Florida. It's a searing heatwave. He picks up Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner). She's married to wealthy businessman Edmund (Richard Crenna), and a passionate affair ensues. She wants to leave Edmund but there's a prenup. So they hatch a plot to kill him.The is one sweaty movie. It is one of the best modern noir. It has all the styles of noir from first time director Lawrence Kasdan who also wrote the screenplay. It takes all the components of the old noir genre and adds the explicit sexuality of newcomer Kathleen Turner. It is very effective. It pushes the genre to new heights.",Body Heat
3,mark.waltz,Film Noir in all its brilliance with a soapy plot twist.,9,29 July 2019,"I have to give Kathleen Turner major thumbs up for an amazing performance in her film debut. I'm watching this for the first time while catching her in reruns of the soap opera ""The Doctors"". It is quite ironic that her soap character was later played by veteran soap diva Kim Zimmer whose resemblance to her is uncanny. They appear together in one scene as lifelong friends who have been bonded because of their similarity in looks, if not their ethics. Turner plays a woman of such powerful sexuality (almost jungle like in its intensity) that it is easy to see why lawyer William Hurt would be willing to commit murder for her. Like ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", Turner is married to an older man (Richard Crenna) who is apparently evilly ruthless. The setup for his murder of course goes differently than planned, and the aftermath shows how great planning doesn't always mean is that crimes like this will go undiscovered or unsolved. it's the twist at the end that makes this unique, one I did not see coming although I had a feeling of something similar.It is obvious that in their many love scenes, both Turner and Hurt were completely nude, and it is also very apparent that their touching of each other is presented authentically. The music score is intense, utilizing only a few notes and repeating over and over, but it is so appropriate for the mood of this film. Ted Danson is great in a supporting role as Hurt's equally amoral law associate, with J.A. Preston quite the antithesis as the third partner. His integrity is quite the opposite of Hurt's and Danson's, and it is through his honesty that everything breaks.There's also another soap actress, Lanna Saunders (who at the time was a front-burner character on ""Days of Our Lives""), playing Crenna's sister, perhaps suspicious but never displaying what she's really thinking in regards to sister-in-law Turner. The heat between Turner and Hurt is wonderfully displayed on screen, and even with the nudity and sexuality, there is something almost graceful in the way that the love scenes are directed. It gets highly complex in spots (particularly with the character played by Mickey Rourke), but everything comes together beautifully when it is all wrapped up. I can see why this is considered a modern classic because it truly has stood the test of time nearly 40 years later.",Body Heat
4,claudio_carvalho,Knowledge Is Power,10,25 April 2009,"In the hot Pinehaven, Florida, the smalltime wolf lawyer Ned Racine (William Hurt) flirts with the sexy but married Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner) and they begin a torrid love affair. After a short period together, she convinces him that her husband and mobster Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna) is an obstacle for their passion and they have a prenuptial agreement; therefore he should be eliminated. Ned carefully plots a perfect scheme for killing Edmund; however things go wrong when successive evidences are disclosed conspiring against him.""Body Heat"" is the greatest homage to film-noir ever! The debut of the writer and director Lawrence Kasdan is an unforgettable masterpiece, and I do not know how many times I have watched this classy feature since 1981 (last time was on 04 February 2001) that is among my favorites. The astonishing Kathleen Turner in her debut in cinema is sexy, hot, and gorgeous performing one of the most Machiavellian female fatales of the cinema history. The novice William Hurt is perfect in the role of the shabby and cynical lawyer Ned Racine. The music score of John Barry is perfect supporting the bleak atmosphere of the story. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Corpos Ardentes"" (""Heat Bodies"")",Body Heat
5,classicsoncall,"""I hope you haven't done us in.""",8,23 October 2021,"It's always great to come across a modern day noir thriller, even if I'm forty years late to this picture. William Hurt and Kathleen Turner add a notable semblance of authenticity to this tale of greed and murder; their passionate love scenes leave nothing to the imagination and are shocking, not so much in execution, but simply in the idea that they agreed to film them so realistically. Their scheme to kill Matty Walker's (Turner) husband begins to unravel when Edmund Walker's (Richard Crenna) will is read, and discrepancies in it's updating by sleazy attorney Ned Racine (Hurt) make it appear to be a bit more than fishy. That part of the story got a little dicey for me, as it was actually Matty who contributed a change that invalidated the will, owing to her brief time as a lawyer's secretary. Ned didn't seem to be aware of it, but he was the one who prepared the new will, so something there got lost in the translation for me.I liked Mickey Rourke's role in the story. As an explosives expert, he warned Ned that what he was about to do was better left undone, arguing that if there were fifty possible ways for something to go wrong, and a killer recognized half of them, he'd be a genius. Obviously, only a mere handful were made by the devious couple, but they turned out to be incriminating to attorney Oscar Grace (J. A. Preston), who worked the case to a fateful conclusion against Racine.It occurred to me that the ending of the story would never have passed muster during an earlier time when the Movie Production Code was still in effect. It stated that a criminal could not go uncaught or unpunished for a major crime, though in this case, Matty Walker, or should I say, 'Mary Ann Simpson' made her getaway soon after setting up Ned to take the fall. The thing is, I think she really did fall in love with Ned, but fell in love with her inheritance even more.",Body Heat
6,gavin6942,Thrills!,8,2 September 2015,"In the midst of a searing Florida heat wave, a woman (Kathleen Turner) convinces her lover (William Hurt), a small-town lawyer, to murder her rich husband (Richard Crenna).This film gets you very quickly with its raw sexuality. And yet, although the nudity is rather extreme, it never seems gratuitous. Which is weird. But hey, I guess sometimes it really does matter.One of the best parts of this film, besides the mystery and intrigue, is Ted Danson. I wish he showed up in the movie earlier. But you cannot always get what you want. Sometimes instead of Ted Danson, you get William Hurt's genitals flapping in the breeze.",Body Heat
7,lee_eisenberg,humid suspense,10,8 February 2012,"Wow! You've NEVER seen anything like ""Body Heat""! Seriously, this is one move that's bound to grow on you. William Hurt plays an incompetent lawyer who befriends sultry Kathleen Turner, and the two of them scheme to get rid of her rich husband (Richard Crenna). The movie's setting is absolutely perfect. It's in Florida amid a heat wave, and everyone is constantly sweating. Of course, this steaminess (in multiple senses) only adds to the chemistry between Hurt and Turner. To be certain, Kathleen Turner looks like a cross between Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Montgomery (could there be a sexier combo?).Obviously, the movie is intended as a tribute to film noir, and it certainly succeeds. Of course, cinema from the old days wasn't allowed to show what ""Body Heat"" does. I dare you not to feel sexually aroused while watching it. Lawrence Kasdan made a fine directorial debut here, and went on to cast Hurt in ""The Big Chill"" and ""I Love You to Death"". It's a perfect movie in every way.Also starring Ted Danson, Kim Zimmer and A.J. Preston.",Body Heat
8,jboothmillard,Body Heat,7,27 March 2007,"When I first heard of it I thought it was some kind of softcore porn movie, I watched it once before and couldn't remember anything, so with it being in the 1001 Movies You Muse See Before You Die book, a second viewing had to be done, from debuting director Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill, The Accidental Tourist, Wyatt Earp). Basically a heat wave is taking place over the Florida coast, but this doesn't stop inept lawyer Ned Racine (William Hurt) and his womanising ways, and he has set his sights on the beautiful Matty Walker (Golden Globe nominated Kathleen Turner). Despite being married to rich businessman Edmund (Richard Crenna), originally not being interested and saying nothing will happen, she does give in to flirting with him, but of course her passion increases and she gives in. Her husband only comes home for weekends, or hardly ever, and Matty signed a prenuptial agreement, and declaring that she loves Ned now she wants to make sure that he cannot interfere any longer, as she hates him and is greedy for his money. So Ned suggests he should kill him for the both of them, and she agrees to help him in any way she can, so he bludgeons him with an object, dumps his body in a shack house he owns, and sets fire to make it look like arson. After Matty does manage to get everything, suspicions rise as the actual death of Edmund, and Ned realises he his got himself into a very dastardly situation, and in the end, it turns out Matty isn't all she appeared to be, spawning a fake identity, and he ends up paying the price in the end. Also starring Ted Danson as Peter Lowenstein, J.A. Preston as Oscar Grace, Mickey Rourke as Teddy Lewis, Kim Zimmer as Mary Ann, Jane Hallaren as Stella, Lanna Saunders as Roz Kraft, Michael Ryan as Miles Hardin and Carola McGuinness as Heather Kraft. I heard about this film, and it sounded like some sort of porn film, and then I noticed it was in my book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I can see why. Basically seedy small town lawyer Ned Racine (William Hurt) lives in Florida, and they are recently experiencing an unusual searing heat wave. Somewhere near a beach he is picked up by married Matty Walker (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kathleen Turner, in her first film). She does try to dismiss him, and keeps in mind of her husband, Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna), but eventually she gives into her feelings, when Ned breaks the window into her house. Their passionate affair continues till she knows her husband is back from his trip, so they hatch a plan to kill him if they want to stay another, it is just a question of can they pull it off. Unfortunately I did drift off somewhere after the murder, so I am not sure what happened that made Matty eventually refuse Ned. But I did like the conclusion where you find out, after it looks like she killed herself with a bomb in her house, that she is not who she says she is. Also starring Ted Danson as Peter Lowenstein, J.A. Preston as Oscar Grace, Sin City's Mickey Rourke as Teddy Lewis and Kim Zimmer as Mary Ann Simpson. Hurt and Turner both give good performances as the passionate lovers who will be torn apart by dark revelations, the plot that sees someone have to kill someone else to be with the lover is good, it does slightly sag afterwards, but I can see why it is a watchable thriller. Very good!",Body Heat
9,ccthemovieman-1,This Will Heat You Up On A Cold Winter Night!,9,26 November 2005,"A modern remake of the 1940s film, ""Double Indemnity,"" this movie has a solid, large fan base of its own. That's justifiable, too, because this is well done.It sports a 1940s-type film noir soundtrack but the rest is purely 1980s. By that, I mainly mean nudity and profanity, although the language isn't that offensive.Kathleen Turner plays a femme fatale, similar to Barbara Stanwyck's role with Fred MacMurray in ""Double Indemnity,"" except with a different ending. Actually, the entire story is quite different from the classic film noir. William Hurt has MacMurray's male lead role. I liked the classic actors better but Turner and Hurt shine with their performances, too.This is steamy movie to say the least. Set on hot, humid Florida summer nights, you can almost feel the heat coming out from the TV screen and the heat from the two leads going at it several times. Turner is excellent as a woman who will go to great lengths for money, as they sometimes do. (Hey, my 87-year-old father is dating a 24-year bimbo in Florida, so I know of where I speak.)The story is divided into three segments: (1) the setup; (2) the romance and plotting of the crime and (3) the crime and unraveling of Hurt as things begin to go very wrong.An intriguing film, this loses nothing with multiple viewings. It's always interesting. The more I watched this, the more I found - as the case frequently is - myself fascinated with some of the lesser characters such as Hurt's two friends, played by Ted Danson and J.A. Preston. Danson, by the way, gives us a preview of the amoral character he played later in the hit TV series, ""Cheers.""This is the kind of film you snuggle up with someone on a cold winter night. It will warm you up as much as your partner!",Body Heat
10,rmax304823,Superior Neo-noir.,7,27 August 2004,"SPOILERS.This initiated a string of imitations and for good reason. It's worth imitating. It owes a lot, obviously, to ""Double Indemnity,"" things both important and inconsequential. If Barbara Stanwyck wears a white dress as the femme fatale in ""Double Indemnity,"" so does Kathleen Turner here. If a goofy character from Medford, Oregon, happens to glimpse the hero in a position of compromise in ""Double Indemnity,"" here it is an eleven-year-old girl. Although the witness and the criminal meet later, in both films the witness doesn't remember the criminal well enough to identify him. I think some of the dialog may be copped verbatim too. ""I don't care about the money. I'm worried about us."" But, no matter if the plot isn't woven out of original cloth. It's a tightly wound story and well executed in every respect. There's never a moment in ""Double Indemnity"" when we can doubt we're watching a 1940s movie. It's black and white, the acting is full of the usual conventions, has a sardonic narrative, and Wilder's direction is functional. Here, in magnificent color, we have more naturalistic -- and superior -- performances, and direction that has the camera linger on unanticipated objects like a lamp post at night on the end of a pier, luminescent in the slight fog.The performances are all good but William Hurt's is exceptionally so. I'll just give one example of what I mean. He, Turner, and Richard Crenna are having dinner together (a marvelous scene) and Crenna tells Hurt that in order to be a success a man has to do whatever is necessary. Too many men hesitate. Hurt smiles and says, ""I know guys like that. I hate them. I'm that kind of guy."" Both men begin laughing and Hurt suddenly stops, his head jerks slightly, and he stares quizzically across the table at Crenna -- because he has just realized he's going to murder Crenna. It's as if Hurt had just had a raw nerve touched without realizing which mental organ it was connected to.Crenna is pretty good in a not very prominent but complex role. Turner mainly projects her body heat by breathing through her open mouth. She has the face of Cleopatra and the heart of Brutus. Mickey Rourke appears only in two brief scenes but is unforgettable. Every word he utters, every movement he makes, commands attention without seeming to do so. Watch his response when he warns Hurt that the device that will cause a fire will be easy to spot, and Hurt distractedly replies, ""That doesn't matter."" Rourke's face twists a little and his lips open in a slight smile and the impression we get is understated amazement.The sound crew too should be congratulated. If a scene is taking place on or near the beach we can hear the hushed rumble of the breakers. If the scene is in Turner's mansion we occasionally hear the slight tinkle of the wind chimes that Turner has used to draw Hurt to her, the way a fisherman uses a colorful fly on trout. The score is slow, moody, and sensuous like the film itself. (There is only one gunshot and no blood.) Excellent use is made of the Florida locations. Boy, is it hot. And nobody goes water skiing or visits Disneyworld or scuba dives. Florida is just a place they happen to live in. It's positively refreshing to not see the Everglades and the air boats.I first saw this because I was curious about the relatively explicit sex scenes that TV commercials assured us would be there. Turner: ""My body temperature is always a little higher than normal. The engine runs fast or something."" Hurt: ""Maybe you need a tune up."" I've watched it a few times since its release and now relish the smaller moments, like the one when Hurt and Turner first meet. It's a hot night and he's walking along the boardwalk past a band stand where a glutinous trumpet lead is playing ""That Old Feeling,"" and while Hurt stands watching, his jacket slung over his shoulder, a slender woman with long dark hair, wearing a slinky white dress, stands up in the front row and strolls up the aisle past him while he gawks. Or the scene in which Hurt, just putting his murder plan into action, parks his car on a Miami street then watches puzzled as a clown in a toy car drives by, not realizing that he is the clown.An unsettling thought: Would this crime have been prevented if everyone had bothered to buy air conditioners?",Body Heat
11,BA_Harrison,Neo-noir with nookie.,8,8 March 2012,"What drives a man to commit murder? In the case of low-rent Floridian lawyer Ned Racine (William Hurt), it's the classic combination of sex and money (with an oppressive heatwave to fuel the craziness) that makes him kill for Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner), sultry wife of shady businessman Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). Unfortunately for Ned, Matty—if that is indeed her real name—is about as fatale as a femme can be, and is using her smouldering looks, sensuous curves and incredible sexual magnetism to manipulate the poor chump like a puppet.Full of hot steamy nights, shadowy offices, smoky bars, and seedy characters on the edge of the law, Lawrence Kasdan's Body Heat has all the elements one might expect from a classic 40s film noir, but being a product of the 80s, is far less suggestive when it comes to the eroticism. Dripping with post-coital sweat, this is one seriously sexy film, with a 27-year old Turner and William Hurt doing things together on-screen that Bacall and Bogie only ever did in private. But Body Heat isn't just about the rampant sweaty sex: the plot is suitably intriguing, the supporting performances are spot-on (including great turns by Ted Danson and a young Mickey Rourke), Kasdan's direction is extremely stylish, and John Barry's jazzy score is simply wonderful.",Body Heat
12,hitchcockthelegend,I hope you haven't done us in?,9,21 February 2012,"Body Heat is written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan and stars William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, Richard Crenna, Ted Danson, J.A. Preston and Mickey Rourke. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Richard H. Cline. Plot sees Hurt as small time Florida lawyer Ned Racine who falls in love and lust with smouldering babe Matty Walker (Turner). Trouble is is that she is married, and as the affair grows more torrid, the pair begin to hatch plans to kill the husband (Crenna) so as to be together and get very rich in the process...Well some can chide it for its debt to Double Indemnity, or even glance scornfully at Kasdan for using sex to sell his reinvention of amoral noirs of the 40s and 50s, but it stands tall and proud in my book of best neo-noirs produced. Causing quite a stir upon its release, Body Heat under Kasdan's watchful eye has most things right for a nod to the glory days of film noir. Male protagonist caught in a lusty web of deceit and murder, femme fatale so smouldering her skin literally does burn, twists and turns in the narrative, photography keeping it down low on light but expanding the colours for extra lurid effect, and a score that fuses seedy like jazz with low Bondian base strains that suddenly get attacked by a shrill to outline the hapless Racine's imploding panic. The dialogue, too, is devilish, especially when delivered so sensually by Turner's crafty honey, a lady bridging the gap between Lauren Bacall and Jessica Rabbit. Yep! Body Heat has it all going on.That was her special gift, she was relentless.Basically Kasdan has brought to life the suggestion involved of something like Double Indemnity, and set it in a sweltering modern day Florida. Free of any code restrictions, he unleashes the sex between the two principals and wraps his biting story around it. It's never sordid or done for the sake of selling tickets, it expertly realises the passion, trickery, and even genuine love? That's going on between Matty and Ned. Helps, too, that Turner and Hurt are terrific in performance and chemistry, while the support cast, courtesy of well thought out writing, really flesh out the plot. There's a problem for genre fans that stop it being a masterpiece all told, that of there being no shock factor come the finale reveal, but the slow boil to the outcome is positively gripping. While the visual views we get of Matty in the final frames leave a question tantalisingly hanging in the air......Slick and sexy, tricky and teetering, Body Heat stokes the fires of noir conventions of old with some style. 9/10",Body Heat
13,Doylenf,"An air of deja vu hangs over the plot line of ""Body Heat""...",6,13 October 2006,"There's plenty of heat generated in BODY HEAT and most of it comes from the steamy situations set up by director Lawrence Kasdan and, in her debut film role, KATHLEEN TURNER, who turns up the heat even more with a dynamic performance as ""the femme fatale"".But all of the material will seem familiar if you've ever seen THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE or DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Still, there are some fresh new twists that will have you wondering just how this whole story will play out once WILLIAM HURT (in a role similar to Fred MacMurray's in DOUBLE INDEMNITY) learns that he's been played for a fall guy by Turner, who wants him to kill her wealthy husband so they can share the wealth.Not only is there a clever twist at the end, but the whole story has been modernized for '80s audiences by including some graphic depictions of soft core sex. Hurt and Turner are frequently seen writhing about in simulated sexual embraces, thus making the title a plausible one.It's the kind of story James M. Cain might have written in the '30s or '40s, and when done as effectively as it is here, with John Barry's intriguing score adding some extra dimension to the film noir atmosphere of the tale, it can hold the audience in its grip until that final moment.Well worth seeing for Hurt's very persuasive performance as the weak-minded lawyer dazzled by sex and Turner's debut as a screen siren.",Body Heat
14,AlsExGal,Body Heat exists in it's own world...,9,27 August 2016,"a world where certain modernities have gotten stuck in time.Written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this film stars William Hurt as Ned Racine, a mediocre attorney in a small southern town who is more famous for one particular legal screw-up - one that figures prominently into the plot - than his small time victories. He gets passionately involved with Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner), beautiful classy wife of rather absentee (always off on business) and somewhat shady businessman Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna) who has implied mob ties. The thing is, what to do about it? They could just run away together, but Matty signed a pre-nup and gets nothing in any divorce, plus she does not want to be poor. This pushes Ned toward a more final solution, a solution that might be made easier considering Walker's mob ties as a smokescreen for any vanishing act Edmund might appear to make.Ned is friends with the local sheriff, Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston) with Ted Danson thrown in before he was the world's most famous Boston bartender in ""Cheers"". Grace is the voice of the law, Danson's character is the voice of pragmatism.This is an anachronistic southern noir that is supposedly taking place in the time the movie was made - 1981 - but doesn't realize thirty years have passed. All of that sweating, the premium placed on a night breeze, all of that ice on sexy necks and down blouses. 90% of the sex appeal - and atmosphere - would disappear if somebody would just turn on the A.C! Mickey Rourke plays a firebug and one of Ned's clients who - without being told EXACTLY what his attorney is up to, throws Ned's advice back at him - ""Any time you try a decent crime you got 50 ways you can mess up. You think of 25 of them and you're a genius. And you ain't no genius"". Rourke's character says this because he genuinely likes Ned. Gosh Rourke was a handsome guy just dipped in masculine mojo back in the day.Matty's past is quite mysterious. She talks about being heavy into drugs when she was young and how a lawyer helped her get clean and gave her a job in his office. And then she met Edmund Walker. Too bad the internet and google didn't exist in 1981, because it could have saved old Ned some tragedy. The lack of google is more tragic than the existence of air conditioning that goes unused.The jazzy/bluesy score is by John Barry, the stylistic cinematography by Richard H. Kline (The Boston Strangler (1968)) . I highly recommend this timeless noir.",Body Heat
15,Uriah43,An Erotic Film-Noir,8,24 March 2016,"""Ned Racine"" (William Hurt) is a small-town lawyer in Florida who just happens to meet a beautiful, married woman named ""Matty Walker"" (Kathleen Turner) one night and immediately becomes sexually attracted to her. After spending some time with her she brings up the fact that her husband, ""Edmund Walker"" (Richard Crenna) has left a sizable sum for her in his will and suggests that if Ned kills him they can have each other along with the money. Soon both of them concoct an elaborate plan to murder Edmund but things don't quite turn out the way it was initially intended. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be an excellent film-noir with solid acting by everyone involved. Of particular note was the steamy performance by Kathleen Turner who dominated every scene she was in. Additionally, the twist at the end was also quite remarkable as well. In any case, I highly recommend this movie for those who might be interested in a film of this type and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",Body Heat
16,morrison-dylan-fan,Body Double.,8,13 August 2019,"A day before having to go the dentist to get a old filling re-done,I found a fading CEX voucher, which I decided to use after going the dentist. Somewhat distracted due to part of my mouth being completely numb, (always a good time go shopping!) I picked up what I thought was a Blu of De Palma's Body Double! After numbness had worn off,I looked again and realised it was not BD, but another title I've heard a lot about for years,that heated me up for a viewing.View on the film:Dumping their left over US stock in the UK under a ""Premium Collection"" label exclusively in HMV, WB present a shockingly poor transfer, from the audio being so muted I had to turn my volume to max for the first time in years, and the grainy image being a encoding no longer used, all tied up by the lazy gits even putting the old DVD menus onto the Blu-Ray.Stepping into cinema, Kathleen Turner gives a seductive, head-turning debut performance as Femme Fatale Matty Walker, who holds all the men in her grip with a burning sensuality that Turner keeps Matty well aware of knowing when to ignite, crossed with a deadly long-term planning mind-set,which tugs Racine to walk her line.Sweating out with fellow lawyers Peter Lowenstein and Oscar Grace (played by the terrific Ted Danson and J.A. Preston) building cases for their clients, William Hurt brings the Noir loner out in the early days of the ""Greed is good"" era with a excellent turn as Racine, whose morals and friendship Hurt tears into a single, greed- Fuelled focus in getting his hands on more of Matty.Taking a drastic turn from writing the action-packed Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark,to a intimate Neo-Noir, the screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan brilliantly displays Kasdan's skill in characterization, via what initially appear as minor characters, (such as Racine's lawyer buddies) being taken by Kasdan as the forces who dig into Racine's and Matty's façade foundation. Clutching Racine in the midst of burning passion, Kasdan thrillingly seeps in Neo-Noir cynicism into his ""romance"" with Matty, until Racine becomes aware all too late that he is drowning in her deadly game.Keeping Kathleen Turner company in her not being the lone person here to make a debut,Kasdan delivers an impressive directing debut, with Kasdan & cinematographer Richard H. Kline keeping the steamy sex scenes (which include a naked Kathleen Turner) erotic,rather than raunchy (pity!),with graceful close-ups on the faces of Matty and Racine, tracking Racine heading towards a crime of passion. Shot during a cold season, Kasdan creates a scorching hot Neo-Noir atmosphere, where every location displayed in stylish panning shots is dripping with sweat, and in enticing overlaying images chopped by close-ups on Racine's face,capturing his realisation that the body heat has gone cold.",Body Heat
17,Mr-Fusion,"Man, this movie just oozes style.",8,26 February 2014,"As neo-noirs go, ""Body Heat"" stands right up there with the greats. And despite its ultra-sweaty setting, it still manages to maintain an ultra- cool style. All of the pieces in this puzzle fit just so perfectly. William Hurt plays a great patsy, completely in over his head; Kathleen Turner is pitch perfect as the femme fatale (she's got that ""bad news"" written all over her . . . and that voice!). And between that sweet '80s sax score (like a soap opera ""Chinatown"") and the incredible tone and setting Lawrence Kasdan kicks off from the get-go, you can just feel the steam coming off of the screen. The plot is twisty enough, but that yearbook scene at the end was one helluva capper. Great movie. 8/10",Body Heat
18,christopher-underwood,Kathleen Turner is quite astonishing in this her first film.,8,11 November 2017,"Writer/director Kasden got just about everything right in this his first feature. The dialogue crackles as befits a neo noir and John Barry's score is always there to to support or promote some wondrous visuals. Kathleen Turner is quite astonishing in this her first film. Her boldness and bravery in the sex scenes ensure that this sizzles from the off and I guess helps to draw attention away from what is really going on. William Hurt hasn't made many films before this and he too seems very relaxed and easy with regard to the nude and non nude sequences. His banter with his colleagues is as believable as his smouldering tete-a-tetes with his co-star. Mickey Rourke is effective in a key small role and the whole thing moves very well. Having seen this upon its original theatrical release, I have always held it in high regard, feeling upon this Blu-ray viewing that it didn't quite race throughout as I had 'remembered' and there seemed to be a slight imbalance on the sound.

21,JamesHitchcock,The Heat of Passion,7,11 May 2007,"Like Polanski's ""Chinatown"" from a few years earlier, or the more recent ""L.A. Confidential"", ""Body Heat"" can be regarded as an example of neo-noir, a film which uses modern cinema techniques while trying to capture the spirit of the classic films noirs from the forties and fifties. The plot- an unfaithful wife conspiring with her lover to murder her husband- was a noir staple, being used in ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"". Indeed, ""Body Heat"" is sometimes described as a remake of ""Double Indemnity""- in my view inaccurately, as there are major differences between the plots of the two films. Although films noirs such as ""Double Indemnity"" frequently had plots which revolved around sexual passion, the moral climate of the forties and the Production Code meant that this had to be implied rather than shown explicitly on the screen. By the eighties the moral climate had become more liberal, which meant that neo-noir films could be far more explicit than their predecessors. Matty Walker, the unhappily-married younger wife of a wealthy and successful but unsympathetic Florida businessman, becomes involved with Ned Racine, a local lawyer, and they begin a passionate affair. (There are several love scenes between William Hurt and Kathleen Turner). They plot together to murder Matty's husband Edmund in order to inherit his money. Racine, as played by William Hurt, is arrogant, swaggering and cocky. He is ambitious but lazy, a man of both dubious competence and dubious ethical standards, who keeps equally dubious company. (His associates include Mickey Rourke's arsonist). He likes to think that he is always in control of the situation, but in reality he can be easily manipulated by Matty, a classic noir femme fatale. This was Kathleen Turner's first film, but she gives a remarkably assured performance as the glamorous and seductive Matty. (To be fair, Barbara Stanwyck was equally seductive in ""Double Indemnity""- an even more remarkable performance when one considers that Stanwyck, unlike Turner, did not have the assistance of nudity or sex scenes). In the second half of the film, the plot becomes increasingly complex and difficult to follow; there is a particularly implausible final twist (which I will not reveal). Nevertheless, film noir is a genre in which atmosphere is often more important than plot (""The Big Sleep"" is a good example). The same holds true for neo-noir, and ""Body Heat"" is a highly atmospheric film. The adjective ""steamy"" is often used metaphorically to mean ""sexually explicit"", but this film can also be described as steamy in the literal sense. The title refers to the fact that Matty is said to have a natural body temperature of 100 Fahrenheit rather than the normal 98.4 (something which doubtless explains her sexual insatiability). It also refers to the fact that the action takes place during a heatwave. The atmosphere is one of extreme heat, of sweat, of physical lassitude, of moral decay and of sexual tension, an atmosphere heightened by John Barry's mournful and highly evocative jazz score. Many scenes take place at night, and director Lawrence Kasdan succeeds in giving these a look equivalent to the classic noir look. Instead of the moody black-and-white photography characteristic of noir, Kasdan uses in these scenes a colour scheme dominated by blacks, reds and oranges, something which emphasises the feelings of heat and passion. ""Body Heat"" was made in the same year as the Jack Nicholson/Jessica Lange remake of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", and the two films were often regarded as evidence of a trend in Hollywood towards a franker treatment of erotic subjects during this period. It seemed that the eighties were going to be the decade of the erotic thriller. That was not quite how things worked out in reality; the arrival of AIDS in the middle of the decade led to a revived moralism in the film industry so far as sex was concerned (although not necessarily so far as violence was concerned), and the levels of eroticism seen in ""Body Heat"" became the exception rather than the rule in the mainstream cinema. (There were a number of so-called ""erotic thrillers"" in the early nineties, most of which seemed to star either Tanya Roberts or Shannon Tweed, but these were films which concentrated much more upon erotica than they did on thrills, little more than softcore porn with a plot). The result is that ""Body Heat"" today seems as much of a period piece as ""Double Indemnity"" or ""The Big Sleep"". It remains, nevertheless, an effective piece of cinema. 7/10",Body Heat
22,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Meh, it was OK",6,15 June 2006,"Now, I recently bought the book ""1001 Movies you must see before you die"" and Body Heat was in it. I heard a lot about this movie everywhere, ""I love the 80's"", two of my movie books, and my mom. Mostly good reviews, but to be honest I wasn't that thrilled. While the plot and acting a very good, the whole story just didn't work for me. It got to be a little bit too over dramatic and just a little silly. Some things just also seemed to be unrealistic. Like the ending didn't make any sense to me, maybe I need to watch it again, but I'm not too interested. This is a newly updated Double Indemity, and Kathleen Turner is the new Femme Fatale, but I just couldn't get into the movie.6/10",Body Heat
23,lasttimeisaw,Cunningly intricate noir story and a staggering screen debut from Ms. Turner,8,7 June 2016,"In the sultry Florida, an unusual heatwave parches its residents, Ned Racine (Hurt), a small-town lawyer, hooks up with a married woman, the drop-dead gorgeous Matty Walker (Turner, in her star- making silver screen debut), he irresistibly falls for her because it is the best sex he has ever had (extolled as one of the hottest moment ever on the celluloid), but is it vice versa? it will be open to debate to the chagrin of Ned in the end. Naturally, Matty is trapped in a dead-end marriage, she is the trophy wife of a filthy rich but sleazy businessman Edmund (Crenna), a murder plan is hatching up after Ned meets Edmund in person which cements his resolution to get rid of the scumbag once and for all (there is no sympathy to the rich hubby, the film firmly sticks to that route, even tactfully suggested by secondary characters, so as to intrigue audience to unconsciously side with Ned and Matty, notwithstanding the atrocious nature of their act), for the sake that he and Matty will be a happy ending, oh, he wishes!BODY HEAT is Lawrence Kasdan's director debut, who was the young and upcoming screenwriter behind two blockbusters STAR WARS EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES (1980) and RIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981) at that time, the film transposes a femme fatale story, more specifically, akin to Billy Wilder's film-noir apotheosis DOUBL INDEMNITY (1944), to a sexually simulating template of a modern world, which would be unthinkable during the Production Code era, and unerringly keeps the twist up its sleeve until the very end, while leaving little hints every so often after the ill- fated husband has been successfully dispatched.The story is exclusively told from Ned's angle, so Matty is portrayed in the most gratifying way, being objectified as a damsel-in-distress with a provocative sex appeal (""do you want to lick it?""), and not just Ned, viewers as well, wants to believe he is her white knight thanks to the deceptive conviction of her perfection, from Ned's viewpoint, everything he has done so far is on a voluntary basis up until the forgery scheme pops out, Matty's perfect image is tainted with her greediness, but that is not the most alerting signal, a waking-up call is that she actually pulls the scheme off, as much as it looks like a windfall, what if it is not? It is just unthinkable that he is outsmarted and manipulated by a bimbo, not in this patriarchal society.It certainly gives Ned a nasty feeling to realise that he has been an unwitting pawn from day one, he is neither a natural force of masculine seduction, nor a well-endowed lover who can both mentally and sexually conquer the object of his desire, he is chosen simply on account of his job, which in fact, he is not very good at; more horrifyingly, he is expendable, that's where lies the cleverness of this otherwise well-anticipated script, Matty's last word to Ned is that she loves him in spite of everything, and as artificial as it sounds initially, if we look back afterwards, we tend to believe she actually means it, that's the exact reason why she doesn't kill him, the only thing she didn't plan beforehand is that she loves him, maybe not to a great extent that she is willing to divulge all her secrets, but she has a soft spot for him, which justifies the tip-off from the arsonist (Rourke, in his very early role, seen in merely two scenes), she does it intentionally, so that Ned can be forestalled, so it would only leave her to detonate the explosion (with an accentuated cue of being delayed for a few seconds), that's why the second murder plan, which looks like a lazy writing job at first, is actually a meticulously schemed escape plan by Matty, to frame Ned as the scapegoat and get rid of the only one who knows her real identity.The plan is so audacious and prone to high risk, it could've been much easier if she were cruel enough to leave Ned as a ""dead"" scapegoat, two bodies, two suspects would be gone in flames, it could be plan A to earn a clean slate. Matty is the ultimate femme fatale, unlike Barbara Stanwyck's Phyllis Dietrichson in DOUBLE INDEMNITY, she will not let herself fall prey of sentimentality, which doesn't imply that she is a callous monster, on the contrary, Ned's fate effectively if implicitly corroborates otherwise, she can relent as long as it doesn't hinder the eventual outcome, it is up to Kasdan's sharply ambivalent characterisation makes Matty so vividly entrancing, embodies mystery, danger and empowerment.Also widely praised for creating a sweaty, sizzling and misty environment in the winter time, for Hurt and Turner's utterly professional commitments, (however Ted Danson is unheralded as Ned's lawyer friend Peter, who exudes a tangible bromance, which unassumingly contrasts the mercurial game Ned is involved, and who says there are no true friends among members of the bar? Not to mention his improvised dance moves, one time, he is reduced into the upper-left corner of the frame, but still he rocks!) BODY HEAT confidently lives up to its reputation in a genre notorious for its gratuitous nudity exploitation and shoddy story development, a rare breed which does't leave a sense of guilty pleasure for being so diverting and erotic.",Body Heat
24,KineticSeoul,"A bit of a slow burn film, but it's alright",7,9 February 2016,"When it comes to these femme fatale type of movies, the formula has become very familiar now. However when this film first came out, it was pretty cleverly executed. I think this is one of the films that inspired the creation of other seductive woman type characters in films that know what they want and know how to play the game. The the story takes place during the summer in Florida when it's going through a heatwave. A woman temps a lawyer with her sexiness and manipulates him to kill her rich husband. So they can take off with his money by legally taking it all by using the legal system. From there are the choices the characters make really start to bite them in the butt. While you as an audience is trying to figure out exactly what is going on and what the main plan that is being utilized is. This is a film for adults and I don't mean that because of the sexual content. But because this is a slow burn movie that will bore most teenagers. Overall, I have seen these types of movies before so the ending was quite predictable for me. But I appreciate it for what it accomplished and brought forth at that time. Plus another femme fatale film came out a year later called ""Basic Instinct"". Which will be a bigger hit because of Sharon Stone and because of a certain scene with her in it.7.6/10",Body Heat
25,sol1218,Steam Heat,9,25 January 2004,"****SPOILERS**** Steamy melodrama set in Florida during the middle of a record heat wave which was nothing like the heat generated on the screen by the two stars, William Hurt & Kathleen Turner, in the movie.Ned Racine, William Hurt, a local lawyer one hot steamy night at a town concert meets sexy and sultry Matty Walker, Kathleen Turner. The results of that chance meeting leads to a sizzling and torrid affair and ends in murder and deception and finally the loss of Ned's freedom in what has to be one of the most erotic and well thought out ""Film Noir"" movies ever made. Unlike the great ""Film Noir"" movies of the 1940's like ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Out Of The Past"" to name a few ""Body Heat"" is not hampered by the restrictions and limitations of the Hayes Commission back then. That's the reason it's much more interesting and less predictable then movies at that time were. Matty who's husband Edmund Walker, Richard Crenna, had her sign a prenuptial agreement before they were married wants him dead so that she can legally inherit all of his wealth. Matty talks a love stung and unsuspecting Ned into killing Edmund not knowing that she's only using him and will drop him as soon as her husband is dead. Ned goes along with the plan even though it seems to be against his better judgment. Even later when Ned starts to realizes that he's some how being set-up to take the fall he's still so infatuated and in love with Matty that he can't seem to help himself from going along with her scheme to kill Edmund. Edmund, the unfortunate husband of the scheming and deadly Matty, in spite of being an astute businessman and good judge of human nature as well as tough as nails doesn't see what's coming in what Matty has in store for him until it's too late. Good early career performances by Ted Danson, Peter Lowenstein, as Ned's friend and fellow lawyer and Mickey Rourke, Teddy Lewis, as an accused arsonist who Ned got off and who later reluctantly gets involved in the murder plot on Matty's husband Edmund. Teddy at first tries to have Ned change his mind about murdering Edmund but without any success. Also very effective in the film is Oscar Grace as J.A Preston a detective and friend of Ned who despite being on to Matty from the start is blind-sided by what Matty's ultimate plans really were, like everyone else in the movie. Superior story and acting with a really unsuspecting ending makes ""Body Heat"" not just one of the best ""Film Noir"" movies of all time but the one that all movies of that genre are to be compared too in the future.",Body Heat
26,ElMaruecan82,Hurt and Turned On by Hurt and Turner...,10,10 June 2019,"""It's the crisis atmosphere. People dress different, feel different, sweat more. They wake up cranky and they never recover."", delivered by J.A. Preston, that line sums up the double role played by heat as both a cause and an effect in many classic noir pictures, protagonists are driven by passion, the heat of the moment, and in crime as in love, they find night as their better allies. Lawrence Kasdan's ""Body Heat"" is no exception where a Florida heatwave will be the trigger of a passionate and luscious romance between William Hurt as Ned Racine and Kathleen Turner as Matty Walker.Directed in 1981, ""Body Heat"" has the smooth and satisfying feeling of these perfect evenings during which thoughts and smiles are shared, words and gazes exchanged and drinks on the rocks continuously filled up without ever interrupting the flows of mutual seduction. As soon as the film started, it hooked me like a sexy passer-by, a simple scene with Hurt staring at some fire burning at night in the background convinced me that it was going to be special. The actor has perhaps one of the mot peculiar physiques of Hollywood, his body is muscular and sensual, which explains why a woman is zipping her dress and addressing him with a mellow voice, but his balding head and sleazy mustache creates an awkward contrast, he's desirable but to a degree he ignores, he's a woman's man but not any woman.The next scene proves that he's more in his element as a womanizer than as a lawyer, he likes to joke about it with his colleagues but he doesn't kid himself about his incompetence, which is crucial for the plot. Like in a good screenplay, nothing is gratuitous, not even the opening fire scene, but there's never a moment without its taste of authenticity. When the characters complain about the heat, we feel the sweat exuding from their pores and even I had a sudden craving for a fresh wine, the film has a way to make you feel like the characters, but it also finds its way to never anticipate anything, it's a film to be conjugated in the present like a cocktail, like sex. You've got to suspect with the right timing, and to be deceived with the right effect. On that level, the screenplay written by director Lawrence Kasdan, achieves something rare, it fools us without insulting our intelligence. Which reminds me...""You're not too smart! I like that in a man!"" says Matty during her first encounter with Ned. I love how Ned doesn't even react to the insult, probably satisfied that there's one thing she likes in him and it's obviously an invitation to go on with his rhapsody. This is a flawed man but a man with hubris, if he didn't think much of himself, having a woman like Matty wouldn't be a challenge, the man doesn't care about being an ambulance chaser, his real arena of self-accomplishment is wherever and whenever there are preys like beautiful women so he can be the predator, heat and nights are his territory. Ned doesn't care about being smart, being a smooth talker is enough, he doesn't aim high until he meets that white clad creature so blasé her soul can't be reached. How about the body then?Ned is the last man who'd complain about the heat, heat unveils sensuality, hidden desires, urges to go at night that can only satisfy his instincts and Hurt has quite a way with his facial language, when he follows Matty, his eyes are almost bewildered, he finally met his match, something worth to focus his energy on, the exchanges that follow isn't without reminding of the ""speed limit"" innuendo in ""Double Indemnity"", Ned throws one-liners and Mary-Ann punchlines, she plays hard to get but he's a worthy opponent and the sexual tension is as palpable as the heat. Eventually, Ned breaks the ice by breaking a window and savagely intruding himself in Matty's house, much to her delight, sex ensues, it's erotic, sensual, adult. But she has a husband and the film, as unique and stylish as it, swims in familiar waters.From ""Double Indemnity"" to ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", many noir classics involved ingenuous schemes to get rid of the husband, schemes that generally backfired at the protagonists because greed and lust were double-edged swords or because there was one manipulation from the start. Matty Walker has all the makings of the femme fatale, the mantis attracting the victim to a web of lies and manipulations left uncertain after one viewing. At the second viewing, I started to notice a few interesting details, she accidentally calls Ned Matty the night they meet, she refers to her husband as ""a small and weak man"", hardly deserved epithets for Richard Crenna. And there's that mysterious girl who looks like her and pops up some night before leaving, add a drop of inheritance issues, a touch of urban sleaze and a pinch of tropical atmosphere and we get a cocktail of lust beautifully wrapped up in eroticism.There are multiples ways to enjoy ""Body Heat"", the film follows a plotline that is exciting and unpredictable, thrilling and even funny at times, it's like a smooth talker, it makes you know it'll lead somewhere. Because it's greater force lies in the acting, every small character is given an extra ounce of depth or believability, even Mickey Rourke makes a short but memorable part as one of Ned's small-time advisers, his colleagues, Preston and Ted Danson as the Moe-Green like Lowenstein is obviously torn between his friendship toward Ned and his need to do their job. On the top of that, Hurt and Turner are perfect and Lawrence Kasdan wrote such a convincing erotic thriller that his film was propelled in AFI's Top 100 Thrills and Passions.Gotta make you wonder why the film isn't better known!",Body Heat
27,paul2001sw-1,Oversteamed pudding,5,15 January 2005,"'Body Heat' is a thriller assembled out of three standard plot elements, each common ways that story-tellers can allow their characters to lose everything, and be complicit in the process. There's the con-trick (in which a character is presented a scenario in which someone else is the loser, and doesn't realise that they are actually intended as the real fall-guy); the honey-trap, where a character is lured into stupidity by sex; and the rabbit-in-the-hat, where a last minute revelation changes everything. Going on this, it's clear that the film is not especially original; but some movies, like 'The Sting', or the works of David Mamet, are similarly composed and are highly entertaining. But 'Body Heat', in spite of some pretensions, never really pulls it off. The film's first phase, in which Kathleen Turner's super-bitch (sadly one of Hollwood's least endearing but most enduring stereotypes) seduces William Hurt's shifty lawyer, is ludicrously over-steamy and also a stagey, slow-moving affair. Most crucially, it fails to make you care about either character, so that the rest of the film feels merely like an extended exercise in plot exposition, the broad thrust of the movie is far too clearly telegraphed so the viewer is left watching simply to see which possible twists have actually been chosen to achieve the necessary overall effect. And the final surprise is actually quite irrelevant, an-after-the fact discovery that makes little actual difference given that, by this time, the villain of the piece has already got away. Which is a shame, as had Hurt's character been partly sympathetic, and with a less contrived plot, this could have been a strong tale of hope, disillusion and betrayal. What's left is a film that thinks its sexy and smart, but is actually just distasteful and dull. Incidentally, the film also reminds one quite how ghastly early 1980s ideas of style actually were.",Body Heat
28,gbill-74877,Steamy noir,9,5 August 2019,"Top shelf noir circa 1981, this is a real throwback, but holds its own with the best of the films from the heyday of the genre. The black and white, shadowy visuals of those old films is replaced with color and the sweltering heat of a Florida summer, and while it's certainly a different feel, it's more than a little atmospheric. The cast is excellent, including the two principals (William Hurt and Kathleen Turner), as well as actors in supporting roles (Ted Danson, J.A. Preston, and Mickey Rourke in particular). There are moments when the dialog seems almost comically stilted especially early on, but in those moments the characters are self-aware, and in general the script has a freshness and honesty to it despite telling what amounts to a classic story, with a few little spins. Director Lawrence Kasdan does a great job with pace and tension, and I also liked how he kept the erotic moments in perfect balance - enough to be seriously steamy and to realistically portray a big part of this passionate relationship, but not overboard in what's actually shown. This along with the ending really makes me wish that some of those old noirs could have been without the Production Code constraint; can you even imagine?",Body Heat
29,secondtake,"Don't even mention Double Indemnity--this falls far short of classic. Not terrible, but...",6,23 March 2010,"Body Heat (1981)I can see where this might have been a popular thriller in its time. It mixes murder, sex, intrigue, and a lush locale in a contemporary and probably slightly edgy way. And it's still watchable, not half bad--but it looks dated. And if William Hurt holds up his end of the acting very well, Kathleen Turner looks increasingly stiff and decorative.Director Lawrence Kasdan likes to make impressive films, on the heels of Stars Wars and Indiana Jones movies (one of each). Body Heat has a couple explosions in it (and a skinny Mickey Rourke associated with them) but it tries to be interior, too, mainly in the mind of Ned Racine (Hurt). The plot has one main thread, and it takes several dramatic twists, and you realize before Racine what is going to happen, and then it happens. We follow Racine with interest but not totally with compassion, since he's made out to be a selfish lady killer, so to speak, and we don't really care if he gets bumped off or not.The scenario alternates between isolated upper crust Florida mansion (a reasonable location but unexceptional) and small town cops and lawyers in offices and diners (none of which is very convincing, between lame acting and derivative writing that sounds like warmed over film noir). The filming (under Richard Kline) is solid and effective but not notable. And so on. In other words, this movie has a reputation that outlasts actually watching it again. If you're traveling alone and it's on the motel t.v. I think it would be perfect--mindless, slightly creepy, slightly cheesy, rather distracting. It could be worse.",Body Heat

It is an impressive directorial debut for Kasdan, who also wrote the script. Turner sizzles in her film debut as a conniving femme fatale.

32,filipemanuelneto,Exudes sensuality through all pores.,7,6 August 2020,"In this film everything revolves around sensuality and the influence of noir is truly clear. Set in a hot Florida summer, the film tells how an unscrupulous and womanizing lawyer gets involved in a torrid case with a blonde beauty on her husband's back. It turns out that the husband is very rich, thanks to speculative and dubious business, and the idea of killing him comes almost naturally. From there ... it's better to see the film.The film is not perfect but it works well. Directed and written by Lawrence Kasdan, who is better known for his work as a screenwriter than for his directorial streak, the film has a very engaging story, built upon an environment of latent sensuality. Heat is an omnipresent element, being almost naturally transmitted from the summer environment to the characters' passionate relationship. As a consequence, the film has several sexually clear scenes and dialogues and some female nudes, which should be taken into account by those who have children at home.Being a film very influenced by noir, the last thing we should expect is one-dimensional characters. In fact, the characters in this film are not what they seem, and this required additional work from the actors that was very well done. This was Kathleen Turner's film debut and she showed that, in addition to being beautiful and sexy, she is a talented actress. William Hurt was also a novice and he work perfectly as a cynical, womanizing and unscrupulous lawyer. The two actors created excellent chemistry. More discreet but decent, the supporting cast has talented names like Richard Crenna, Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke.Technically, it is a regular film, but has an excellent cinematography, which articulates very well night and medium light scenes, loaded with sensuality and malice, with day scenes where heat is almost palpable in its intense light and strong colours. Sets and costumes are excellent, the choice of cars for the two main characters also suggests a lot of their personality (especially Ned Racine's car, perfect for an inveterate womanizer). Inescapable, the initial credits exude sensuality in the way they were conceived and serve very well to introduce us to the film environment, something that would be much more difficult otherwise or without the indispensable help of the impeccable soundtrack, signed by John Barry.",Body Heat

34,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Classic Noir 'Double Indemnity' gets a steamy, non-noir, updated and little dumber Adaption",6,6 June 2020,"Body Heat (1981) Review :-Classic Double Indemnity gets a steamy, non-noir, updated and little dumber Adaption. I wasn't much interested in watching this film as i have been busy watching some full proofed Classics but then I read on Wikipedia that this film is an adaption of Genius Billy Wilder's First Ever Classic 'Double Indemnity' (1944) which is one of my favourite film of 40s decade. Most of the people have liked the film, there hasn't been much negative talk about it and i am also not going to call it a bad film. It is just that when you are adapting a Memorable Classic Noir you must deliver a Classic film and if you doesn't then think before doing so because you could have easily made just another Good film without adapting a Classic. Now here's what you have missed in Body Heat and why it is overrated.We all know the plot of Double Indemnity, a woman plans to kill her rich husband with the help of her boyfriend to get all money. Here we have little changes so let's go through them to find mistakes. A lawyer Ned Recine having an intimate affair with sexy Matty Walker kills her husband Mr. Edmund so that half of his property will be given to Matty. Firstly, the character of Ned here is shown as a playboy having a different woman every night in his bed but plot couldn't justify why he has decided to kill Edmund and how a playboy got so seriously involved with a married woman, to whom he clearly said that, he just wanted to have it for one night. Secondly, he doesn't seem like taking this murder plan seriously because he just doesn't plan a single thing in this murder and doesn't even think about possibilities of getting caught whereas in Double Indemnity if you remember, the guy decides to kill the husband only after making sure that the crime is safe to commit. Third mistake is probably the most dumbest thing as Ned himself being a lawyer doesn't even understand that he has been taken for a fall guy by the woman. Even after consistent warnings from his friends and even after discovering several playgames himself he still goes to the place where Matty asked him to go and that too without any plan or precautions. And in spite of having a open chance to punish her he just lets her go. Wasn't he little extra dumb to be called a Lawyer. Even a small kid from audience could have predicted that the woman is gonna fly away at this moment and then there were no thrills left after that. It just got little predictable for the smart viewers (for that matter to me too). Maybe he was a dumb guy and the writer wanted him to be a dumb guy so that the woman can be proved smarter and that was the the real motive of change in the climax from Double Indemnity. But believe me guys the faceoff has to be between a smart and an oversmart then only it makes some mind-blowing stuff otherwise there is no fun watching a face off between a dumb and a smart. In Double Indemnity you know the dame was smart but the guy was smart enough too and therefore he finds out the truth to punish her to make a perfect Noir. Here, in Body Heat there is nothing that can be called Film Noir. Ned should have shot her after discovering everything and should have gone to jail himself as he was going to get jail anyways. He knew that Matty has done all this still he just let her go. Now this is something really silly which bothers me that a lawyer who should have known much about murders and all doesn't know anything at all. He doesn't plan anything at all. And after all this dumb show he's the smart one who discovers the truth of Marty's original identity just by sitting in jail whereas he didn't act smart for a moment throughout the film when he was free.Now talking about some potholes concerning the woman in the film. At the end you realise that she has planned this all much before, but in the plot there were several important incidents which happen accidentally. Come on man if you are showing us a smart game set by a smart woman you can't expect us to believe accidental things to be a part of a the plan. One of the weakest move in the film is, that woman has stolen the identity of another woman and still she gets all the money legally as if it was so easy to get the money legally without any checking and it was so easy to leave country with duplicate identity and lots of money. Well, most of our films in the past have shown us how difficult it is to get money and fly away, and most of our Heroic characters have been killed too but here she just disappears easily. Another major loophole in the film is the pre-climax scene when Matty asks Ned to visit Boathouse where she has planted explosives to kill Ned. Ned arrives and finds out the explosive but still let her go and she disappears. Then the explosives blast. How? It was supposed to blast after somebody opens the door as it was wired and set like that and if Matty didn't open it (as she has flown away) then who opened it? Here, Matty's character also fails to deliver a perfect plan (as Ned calls it so perfect) because she never asked Ned to kill her husband, Ned himself decided to kill him and Ned's decisions cannot be part of her smart plan, right? Also, in the blast scene she arrives the place late supposing Ned would be dead by then but when she arrives she couldn't see any fire to realise that he's not dead but still she walks in unaware. Then she comes to know that Ned has almost got her and he could have easily shot her but like I said he was so dumb to let her go despite knowing that she is the one who planted explosives and she would never blast it to kill herself, but as said in the film she didn't have any plan for this move by Ned. It just happens accidentally that Ned lets her go. At the end we were asked to believe these accidental things as part of her smart plan, wasn't it a big joke? Another noticeable loophole is Edmund's will. When Matty makes a fake will which was meant to be disapproved and so it waa disapproved but what makes the real Will become useless? If the fake will is disapproved then the first will which was legally correct should have been applied but here both the Wills are disapproved and Matty gets all money. The first will had no issues to be terminated, that didn't make any sense to me.Now coming to some other logical points. The film breaks 2 boundaries, one is that it is Sexually explicit (I'm sure you will enjoy it) and two is it breaks the basic code of Evil doers must be punished in the end. Somehow it does keep the code of you think over it again. Ned goes to jail, not because he was so dumb and silly, well, being dumb is not that big crime, but because he has killed the man so he deserved the punishment. On the other side, Matty goes free because she hasn't actually committed any crime, neither she asked Ned to kill her husband nor she killed Edmund and Ned. She had sex with Ned and Husband multiple times, she had fun of course, and now she got that money, what else a woman want? But she killed the real Matty, for what she deserves to be punished but she hasn't been punished at all. Even her so called perfect plan was full of loopholes. She didn't ask Ned to Kill her husband, he himself had made his mind and she cannot plan a thing on Ned's mind, instead she should have asked him to kill her husband at least once to make it look like a plan. Let's just accept she got it because Ned was dumb and if it wasn't Ned, she would have seduced someone else to do but would that someone else be so dumb? What if he comes out smart. Matty couldn't even have a perfect plan for a dumb guy then how would have she survived against the smart fella? So many loophole cannot be overlooked in a thriller genre, i am sure those who rated this film like 8/10, 9/10, 10/10 wouldn't hesitate to reduce their rating now. My final rating would be as good as and as bad as it deserves and it will surely be less than what people gave it to make overated.Body Heat could have made more thrilling and twisty ending if the writer wouldn't have limited thoughts. Now just suppose if i were a writer i would have made the real Matty to go away with all this. Just imagine, the real Matty has planned it all. She did ask her friend Mary to appear as Matty and do all this stuff but at the end instead of real Matty, real Mary is Killed and Ned goes to jail. The Matty flies off with all the money because she is the real Matty so legally it was easier for her than Mary.There is lot to enjoy in the film if you've had enough of mistakes. William Hurt and Kathleen Turner will surely keep you engaged with thier hot chemistry and intimate sex scenes. As an actors they could have done better but they does well in pornography. Lawrence Kasdan could have made this film much pacy because this film looks quite slower compared to Double Indemnity despite having almost similar runtime. Like I said this is a steamy version but actually that sexual explicitly wasn't helping the narrative at all nor it was doing any good to the screenplay to look advanced. Body Heat still makes a good film but if you have seen Double Indemnity you will surely point out the mistakes easily and feel reluctant. And even after that it is still an enjoyable and watchable film for some steamy romance but if you have to watch Just one film on this topic them Double Indemnity is preferable by a margin. It's easy to copy a theme from a Classic but it's not easy to match the Geniusness who made the film Classic, after all Billy Wilder was a real genius. Body Heat is at 7.4/10 (mostly because many people haven't seen the original from 40s and post 80s genaration are more internet and sex friendly) and Double Indemnity is at 8.3/10 on IMDb despite the gap of 37 years, i guess i have made my point crystal clear.RATING - 6/10*",Body Heat
35,Anonymous_Maxine,"Absolutely engrossing, in a sweaty kind of way",10,20 December 2002,"Body Heat is a resurrection of the film noir genre, which has been on some kind of back burner since the 1940s or so. This is one of the more distinct film genres, even more so than such genres as comedy or action or horror, which all have a tendency to blend into one another to some extent. Films noir are extremely characteristic pieces of filmmaking with a very rigid set of distinguishing elements, but it is a genre that has largely been left behind in the era of gangster movies before they were made into a joke by later spoofs like Dick Tracy, which is why it is sort of surprising to see the genre brought back to life so effectively by a movie like Body Heat. It's good to know that even genres that have seemingly been left behind still have some life left in them for great films. Body Heat is widely compared to one of the original, and still one of the best, films noir ever made, Double Indemnity. As is often the case in films noir, Body Heat tells the story of a very effectively portrayed romance gone horribly wrong. William Hurt and Kathleen Turner work amazingly well onscreen, and the cloyingly hot and muggy atmosphere takes a welcome turn from the typical wet streets of classic noir films and makes it work spectacularly well in enhancing the tension of the film.
I've noticed that some other reviewers recommend watching Double Indemnity before viewing Body Heat, but I don't think the order matters as long as you see both at some point. Body Heat is a tremendously effective film made by the capable Lawrence Kasdan, and it borrows heavily from its 1944 counterpart. Both films are more than capable of standing on their own, but they have a complementary relationship that enhances both films without belittling one or the other. Mickey Rourke delivers an early performance as the surprisingly effective arsonist, but the real surprise in this film is Ted Danson, whose performance as Peter Lowenstein just about steals the whole movie. He is a perfect, if rather ham-handed, example of a three-dimensional character, in that he has this interest in dancing that is not linked to anything that happens in the film except to make him a more interesting character, and his performance, I will admit, far surpasses anything of which I had previously thought Mr. Danson capable. Bravo.",Body Heat
36,st-shot,Heat spikes before going cold.,6,20 July 2021,"This Double Indemnity knock off heats up fast but eventually wilts under Lawrence Kasdan's fustian eroticism and languid pace with a far fetched outcome.Sybaritic Florida lawyer Ned Racine (William Hurt) meets Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner) at an open air concert one sultry summer evening. The priapic Racine comes on strong and in no time the two are going hot and heavy with each other. The intensity between the two reaches fever pitch and they are soon discussing ways to off her wealthy husband (Richard Crenna).With a heat wave for backdrop Hurt and Turner rev the passion up hot and heavy early with such intensity it makes murder plausible. Hurt's unctuous sleaze lawyer and the enigmatic Matty make a nice amoral pairing but Kasdan's dialogue becomes winded and Matty's deception obvious before a deus ex machina takes the film in another direction, the outcome even more implausible. A decent effort at a classic that withers at crunch time.",Body Heat
37,MBunge,One of the best noir films since 1960,7,1 September 2010,"Body Heat is a rarity in film. It's both a loving and faithful homage and an outstanding story in its own right.The movie is the story of Ned Racine (William Hurt), a small-time lawyer in a Florida small town who's coasting through life providing mediocre representation to his bottom-of-the-barrel clients. Ned's the sort of guy who'll bed any available woman but lights up a cigarette after he's finished jogging. Then, one night down on the beach front, Ned notices the stunning and sultry Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner) and runs after her like a starving dog chasing a cat covered in steak sauce. They fall in lust and after some tremendous nude scenes, decide that the best thing for them is to do away with Matty's older, wealthy and legally shady husband Edmund (Richard Crenna). But like most ""boy-meets-girl, boy-kills-girl's husband"" stories, things don't work out all that well for the boy in the end.Body Heat is clearly Lawrence Kasdan's attempt at making a modern (for the 1980s) film noir. But he's not trying to reimagine or reinterpret the genre. He's not trying to put some new twist on the classic noir story or use it as a forum for postmodern meta-commentary on something or other. You could call it formulaic, but that's only a bad thing if you don't happen to like the original formula.What Kasdan does do is take noir and successfully bring it from the black-and-white era of its origins into the less restricted movie world of the 1980s. Body Heat has all the elements and tone of the classic noirs, but doesn't have the same limitations on what it can say or show on screen. Ned and Matty's first meetings at the beach and in a bar are dominated by the same clever, back-and-forth, sexually charged banter, but it's slower and more realistic than the contrived, rat-a-tat-tat verbal jousting of classic noir. And the language they use, while smart and funny, is cruder and more raw than the Sunday School vocabulary all movies used to be hemmed in by. The sex that had to simmer and seethe beneath the surface in the 1940s is boldly splashed and sloshed all through Body Heat.William Hurt gives a great performance as a somewhat charming loser who finds himself drawing on reserves of strength and smarts he's never been motivated enough to use. And while Kathleen Turner's role as the femme fatale is a bit more limited, as those roles tend to be, she makes the audience seen what Ned sees in Matty – a tough and beautiful front covering up the weak and desperate for love woman inside. Ned sees Matty as his chance, not to be a hero, but to be the main character and not a bit player in the story of his life. Ted Danson also does a nice job as Ned's friend Lowenstein, the assistant county attorney who figures out what Ned and Matty have done but doesn't really care.Though it debuted in 1981, Body Heat only looks and feels marginally dated. Camera work has gotten a bit more sophisticated since the early 80s and there are a couple of times when it looks more like a TV movie than a big screen experience and it was made in the era before everything in a film had to be hyper-pretty or hyper ugly. William Hurt doesn't have a phenomenal physique and the characters all wear the sort of clothes normal people would wear, not the overly stylized outfits of today's films that either look a lot better or a lot worse than what people really wear. And Kasdan manages to weave a lot of clever foreshadowing through the story, where a scene becomes more meaningful as you recall it later in the film.About the only real weakness of Body Heat is that to get the ending they wanted, Ned has to give a little speech and made a bunch of rather extreme assumptions in order to set it up. But if you can only make a minor complaint about the last 3 minutes of a movie, you've just watched something really good.",Body Heat
38,smatysia,"Good film, Kathleen Turner was eye candy",8,7 February 2005,"A darn good movie. The plot and direction are first-rate. William Hurt was at his best back then. Mckey Rourke, even only in two scenes, was at HIS best, then, too, playing his part with low-key intensity that seemed totally natural. It's a real shame that his career utterly exploded in the 90's. Kathleen Turner was very beautiful, and was cast well for this part. I understand that this was her first feature role, however and it showed a few times. There was a little bit of wooden line reading in a few scenes, not by any means most. And for all I know that was direction, meant to give the audience a clue about her feelings for Hurt's character. Her celebrated nude scenes were well done, and I was a bit surprised by the petiteness of her bust. Don't get me wrong, I thought she was gorgeous, it's just that nowadays most actresses would get major silicone work before doing a scene like this. I miss the days when that wasn't an option, nor considered necessary, or even desirable. Some of the plot twists one can definitely see coming, but they are entertaining to watch play out nonetheless. This film is worth the price of a DVD. Grade: A",Body Heat
39,fertilecelluloid,Brilliant humidity-tinged thriller!,9,31 December 2004,"Lawrence Kasden's first and best film is a reworking of Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY and is brilliant stuff. THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is combed for tone and detail also.William Hurt, in his least ""affected"" role, is a horny sap who becomes the pawn of master manipulator and steaming hot slot Kathleen Turner (in her screen debut).Perfectly measured performances aside, three other elements contribute to the dazzling success of this coloured, humidity-tinged ""noir"" -- Kasden's stylish, fluid direction, John Barry's luscious, striking musical score and Richard Kline's vibrant, atmospheric cinematography. This isnot to undervalue other tech and aesthetic contributions; it's just that the above three are forefronted in every scene and are so seamlessly married into the whole.The erotic sequences are hot as well, especially the first scene between Hurt and Turner where Hurt removes Turner's panties and gazes down on her before forging his way into her delectable body.Ted Danson makes a strong appearance as Hurt's friend and adviser, and Richard Crenna, playing Turner's filthy rich husband, is totally convincing in his pivotal role.Unfortunately, though it was issued many years ago as a limited edition CD, the film's original score is not available; the one you can buy is one of those frustrating re-orchestrated jobs.Riveting from beginning to end.",Body Heat
40,onepotato2,Humid weather we're having,4,11 April 2009,"The first half an hour of Body Heat is beautifully written, shot and set up. The photography, the lush John Barry score and the central idea are all fine. It's so good that it makes the mere dabbling in noir style that follows a disappointment. While it occasionally matches some good paleo-noir moments in the early part, it never tops them... which seems to be the appeal of a really great neo-noir. And it lacks those key moments where a twist, a camera movement and the score all come together to create chilling, indelible, filmic anchors. Unfortunately it just runs too long, and is insufficiently complex.Its second hour just lays there like a corpse once you know the twists (There are four: the will revised, the child witness, the boathouse, the yearbook). By the one hour-twenty minute mark, the tedium has become palpable, and it should start moving speedily towards a whammo ending that is still 40 minutes in the offing. In the eighties, if you knew nothing about noir, the later developments would be surprising and suffice, but at this point there's no place else the plot is going except a straight shot to Hurt's gallows, and it's not a very thrilling ride. The final twist is nice but it doesn't excuse the slack pacing of the second hour.This is a worthy attempt to revive and invigorate noir. As far as Kasdan goes, this is accomplished. He moved on to one mediocre hit movie that will never receive a critical reappraisal (The Big Chill - it doesn't deserve one) and countless duds, none worse than ""Grand Canyon,"" the dreaded unsubtle 'serious film' every crappy director can't wait to make. And it's a shame-filled, wilting trajectory from here to Lost in Space (!) for William Hurt. This is the height of Kasdan, Turner and Hurt's careers. None of them could recapture half the buzz of this movie. And Body Heat must represent some sort of high point for shirtless scenes involving a male lead. Kasdan must have had quite a man-crush on Hurt at the time.",Body Heat
41,raulfaust,One of the best thrillers,9,24 November 2012,"Many people complain that nowadays movies are full of pornography and nude scenes, as if it wasn't showed in the past. ""Body Heat"" proves that you can have sensual scenes in a serious thriller, and it does not spoil it's atmosphere. The main story used in this picture was quite original back when released, since nowadays people from all over the world do that, just to get some money-- as if money is more important than people themselves. All the cast is completely professional, there isn't a single scene that I could say they were acting. Maybe acting in the eighties was much better and I just noticed. Don't expect this movie to be scary-- the only freak scene is when William Hurt puts on a mask in front of the beach and looks like Freddy Krueger. Be prepared to see a movie full of twists and mysterious moments. Also, while watching this you will imagine how hard it is to deny something you know you did when everyone is questioning you-- I surely wouldn't take it, I would confess from the get go haha.

42,PredragReviews,Kathleen Turner is hot!,8,26 May 2016,"This is a sexy thriller not to be missed. If you like a plot with twists and turns and an unexpected ending, you'll love ""Body Heat"". It's literate, suspenseful, well-acted, beautiful photographed, reasonably believable, and very, very sexy. The script is superb, the performance of William Hurt, Kathleen Turner and Mickey Rourke (it was Turner's and Rourke's debut) are exceptional, and the plot is just a dream come true. This movie is an excellent example of film noir; however, since it was released thirty years after that genre's heyday, some critics originally dismissed it as a ""Double Indemnity"" knockoff. Indeed, it does closely resemble that Billy Wilder classic, and, as Roger Ebert noted, it's hard to make a modern film noir.Body Heat is amazing in that it manages to keep the beloved elements of the genre and make them seem fresh and new, while adding a different visual style and of course putting the passion between the leads front and center in a way never before possible. The writing is amazing for both structure and dialogue. Turner and Hurt are in their early thirties and at the height of their considerable good looks. Ted Danson brings both lightness and a somber sadness to his role as the best friend and all of the supporting cast are amazing. The sexuality was definitely groundbreaking for the time. If you haven't yet seen this movie, do yourself a favor and buy it or stream it as soon as possible. It really does belong on those lists of top movies for its brilliance and is entertaining besides.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Body Heat
43,eric262003,Shows Performers Before They Were Famous,7,13 August 2019,"For those familiar with William Hurt, he's one of those performers who you either liked him or you didn't like him. The complexity of understanding Hurt could stem from either liking him when you are in the mood, either that or people just hate him for the bad decisions he's made over the years by allowing himself to star in stinkers without much thought into knowing until it is too late.The type of formula that you see in a William Hurt film is he could play off as a handsome man with an equally portioned out intelligent man with a touch of being befuddled which fit in well with a lot of movies back in the 1980's. Plus he can let his confused ways get the better of him while staying intelligent. But his best roles come when he's playing the smart guy who isn't as smart after all.The pseudo-intellectual is the kind of role that that Hurt is at his best and that is why ""Body Heat"" stands out well for me even 38 years later. Hurt isn't the only main contributor that stands out here. There's that brilliant script that's written by Lawrence Kasdan who also directed the movie which a lot of it's pull comes from the success of ""Double Indemnity"" but has dialogue upgraded to 1980's logo. But it's Hurt's performance that has me coming back to watch overtime.Hurt stars as Ned Racine, a Florida lawyer that can't get a lucky break, except when he's having intercourse with many women as possible particularly those in uniform. Then he meet a young lady named Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner) who's married to a rich man. They eventually get seductive to each other which eventually leads to an affair and all goes well until they meet Matty's husband Edmund (Richard Crenna) which they decide to kill the man and take his fortunes.Just like the movie 'Double Indemnity"" things just go downhill from there. It might have a predictable outcome, but the performances truly stand out here especially from William Hurt as he's upgraded by the performances by his allies including persecuting attorney Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson before his ""Cheers"" days) and Detective Oscar Grace (J. A. Preston), But Ned realizes that he's not ahead of things but actually behind it.The staging is what truly stands out and though Danson stands out on the small screen like ""Cheers"", ""Becker"" and ""CSI"", the big screen not so much. But in this movie he never looked better. It was great to see Mickey Rourke shine on the screen in a small role, but here we knew that this kid had potential and not just a pretty face. But they're pale in comparison to Hurt's performance, even his jog under the Florida sun while insecurely lighting a cigarette.The only bland performance comes from Kathleen Turner's role. Sure she has nice body, her acting was very one-dimensional. And sure she was paying homage to Joan Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck in an airy, seductive mannerism, but it feels out of place with the contemporary presence with theother performers. Sad in a way because the ending had potential to be a lot better. For a noir film it's not very memorable, but it's far from the worst, it still does its job by telling a good story with well invested characters.",Body Heat
44,philip_vanderveken,A sizzling debut,7,2 August 2005,"I must say that the idea stated by this movie - that people tend to get more violent and don't seem to care about the law anymore once it gets hot - is quite interesting. I don't know if someone has ever done some research about the link between crime and hot weather, but I wouldn't be surprised if there is one. The fact that it is used in this movie proves nothing of course, but it's an idea that Lawrence Kasdan, the writer as well director of this movie, has used and developed very well in this film.Ned Racine is a dubious lawyer in a small town in Florida who suffers from the heat wave that has covered the entire state. On one evening he meets the married Matty Walker and it doesn't take long before the two start a steaming affair. But there is only one thing that stands between them and eternal happiness. Matty's rich husband Edmund is a problem that needs to be taken care of. They start planning his death, but the question if they will get away with it remains. One thing is for sure, they should never get too greedy by wanting all his money...With William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke I must say that Lawrence Kasdan certainly had a nose for young talent. None of them was famous yet, but they all have worked on a nice career since. The only veteran actor that he casted for this movie was Richard Crenna, so in a way I must say that this was a great gamble. But it worked and that's all that really matters. But I'm sure that it wouldn't all have been that nice if it hadn't been for the interesting story. I don't know if Kasdan is a fan of the film noire, but this entire movie sure feels like one.I guess it's thanks to the many talents of Lawrence Kasdan that this movie has become such a nice debut for him. He worked with some nice actors, but gave them an interesting script to work with in the first place. Add to this some good, perhaps a bit classic, directing and you get a movie like this one. I liked it and that's why I give it a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10.",Body Heat
45,DeeNine-2,I'm sweating,8,19 September 2002,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This is a very cleverly contrived sexploitation thriller, penned and directed by the talented Lawrence Kasdan. It stars Academy-Award winner (Kiss of the Spider Woman, 1985) William Hurt with a mustache and a dangling cigarette as Ned Racine, a not overly bright Florida lawyer smitten by Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner in her steamy film debut) a rich housewife with a husband she hates, and a yearning to breathe free. Shades of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity, both triangle murder tales made into film noirs.Kasdan is cribbing, but I forgive him since in some ways his film is an improvement on both the novels and the films they inspired, plus his is a kind of satire on those films with numerous witticisms. I especially liked it when Matty describes her husband, Edmund, a hard-nosed and successful financier played repulsively by Richard Crenna: ""I can't stand the thought of him. He's small and mean and weak."" Ned gives this some serious thought and then kisses her on the head like she's a good little girl.Not too much later, after the first mention of the murder, immediately in the very next scene, Kasdan does a little foreshadowing with lawyer Ned visiting the jail. The steel door clangs shut behind him, startling him and causing him to jump in fright. I also liked the fog on the night of the murder, and I especially liked it when Ned, after putting the body in the trunk, closes the lid to reveal Matty standing there directly in our line of sight, a kind of visual witticism. I also liked the scene in which the lawyers are sitting around the varnished wood with Matty and the woman she has shrewdly cheated, and the lead lawyer asks if anyone would like to smoke. Everybody (except Ted Danson) eagerly and immediately lights up. Ted says he'll just breathe the air. This is a little in-joke satire by Kasdan on the fact that Hollywood movies of the day were financially encouraged by the tobacco companies to show the players happily puffing away as often as possible. William Hurt really is excellent, almost as good as he was in Kiss of the Spider Woman, and that was very good indeed. Turner is completely believable as a voracious and greedy femme fatale with a wondrous criminal mind. The dialogue is sharp and clever throughout; especially interesting are the dueling ""pick-up"" rejoinders by Ned and Matty when they first meet. Noteworthy is the performance of Ted Danson of TV's ""Cheers"" fame as a prosecutor in black-rimmed specs. He has some spiffy lines of his own and he does a great job, as does Mickey Rourke as Teddy Lewis, Ned's fire-bombing buddy. The plot twists are in some sense anticipated, but the exact nature of their unfolding is fascinating to watch. Indeed, Kasdan's snappy direction of his diabolically wicked tale is practically seamless. This is not to say that it was perfect. I have to point out that the scene in which Matty is in the tub with Ned and he dumps more ice cubes in to cool her off is a little on the contrived side since they surely had air conditioning. She claims to a natural body temperature of 100, reminding me of the classic rock lyric, ""I'm hot-blooded, check it and see/I've got a temperature of a hundred and three."" Also Matty's seduction of Ned was a little too fortuitous. I don't think she would have left so much to chance. But I liked the beginning anyway because it led us to believe that this would be a tale of sexual obsession (which in part it is) and not just an adulterous murder thriller. I also could not, even though I rewound the video, catch what was said in the final scene. (Probably that's just my ears going the way of the waist line.)Be advised that the sex is indeed steamy. If explicit sex offends you, you will be offended. Of course I was not. Indeed I found it somewhat refreshing to see a movie in which there is only sexual appetite without any pretense of love or redemption, just lust and its accompanying disillusionment.This is film noir for 1981 just before the rise of AIDS and the sexual self-censorship that Hollywood embraced (as it switched to more explicit violence).

Kathleen Turner bears more than a passing resemblance to Lauren Bacall and is definitely the star turn only matched by Richard Crenna who plays her husband. William Hurt is the flaw in the whole movie. He is seriously miscast. Not for one minute do you believe that Maddie is a weak woman in need of the help that Ned offers her. The lust is believable and Kathleen Turner's performance is right up there with the best. However, the plot fizzles quite badly at the end with the boathouse scene, it is overwritten and totally unnecessary for her to say she really loved him and also her scene on a beach with a new man - I would rather not know how or where she is living today, thank you very much.

Anyway Ned chats her up, and after a little chasing they start what others might call a ""torrid affair"", I might say that he starts nailing her frequently.Kathleen tells him that she is married to a local wealthy businessman, who she describes as a corrupt w**ker, and over the following weeks their idle chat regarding him turns more ominous, as they discuss how much better they would have it if he was dead.When the husband returns home for the weekend, he brings with him his niece, who springs Ned and Kathy mid session and runs off. Ned then consults a kid that he saved from prison as to how best to kill the husband so it appears accidental. The kid is played by a young Mickey Rourke, who sounds very much like he is 12, a far cry from the broken down man that feels up chicks in public nowadays.To save time, the husband does indeed buy the farm, though not altogether as planned, and the ensuing days see Ned as a suspect, not surprisingly he gets a little paranoid, as two of the guys unknowingly trying to nail him are a fellow lawyer and a police investigator, both of whom were his friends.The evidence builds until a coincidental meeting changes Ned's worldview somewhat, and it all becomes clear shortly after - to him and us.There is a big difference between ancient caveman rock paintings and say Michelangelo, just as no-one would bother pitting an abacus against a supercomputer. I feel the same way about early horror movies like Halloween, it is still effective in its own way but I would hardly call it an amazing piece of cinema if it were made today, given the number of movies released since.I think of Body Heat in the same way, it may have been effective when released but I have seen so many twist movies in the last several years that in this one I saw the ending coming from the first 25 minutes, so when it arrived I was more disappointed that I was right than impressed.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. I've seen worse, but now that I have seen this movie I can think of no reason that would make me wanna see it again.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com",Body Heat
48,PimpinAinttEasy,Sleazy yet classy .....,8,5 August 2014,"BODY HEAT is the kind of film that I like. I knew 10 minutes into this movie that it was my kind of movie. The kind of movie that a sleazy and horny guy like me would enjoy. I almost felt like getting a drink while watching this. The jazz bars, the sweaty evenings, the beer cans, the cigarettes, the blondes - all of this is foregrounded to create a very sleazy yet classy aura.This was made in the time when pussies like WILLIAM HURT and TED DANSON were making their mark as Hollywood leading men. But HURT does a good job here. And KATHLEEN TURNER is very very sensual. The two of them have great chemistry. TED DANSON was a bit of an eye and ear sore. But that could be forgiven. MICKEY ROURKE who later said in an interview that he didn't think HURT was much of star, appears in a bit role.The heat of Florida was probably exaggerated a bit, especially in the sex scenes. But the opulent lifestyle of the rich in Florida is nice to look at. I wonder if this is one of the best films based in Florida. JOHN BARRY's score is used to great effect. This really is a great film noir.(8/10)",Body Heat
49,seymourblack-1,"""When It Gets Hot, People Try To Kill Each Other""",8,27 May 2010,"This superior thriller is an unequivocal homage to classic film noir and ""Double Indemnity"" in particular. It's often been credited with having triggered a whole new interest in the noir style and of being an early example of what is now recognised as ""neo-noir"". As ever with these types of classifications, there is a great deal of divergence of thought on the issue. What is harder to dispute, however, is that ""Body Heat"" is a marvellously entertaining updated noir which contains the same types of themes which were evident in classic noirs and also many examples of the same visual motifs. The elements which are newer and reflect the period in which the movie was made are the colour, nudity, bad language, fashions and 1980s attitudes. Lawrence Kasdan's directorial debut is very impressive but better still is his screenplay which is smart, sharp and at times, hilariously funny.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is an inept lawyer who gets involved with an unhappily married woman called Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner) and very soon the couple embark on a torrid affair. Matty is married to Edmund (Richard Crenna), a shady businessman who is only at home at weekends. He's considerably older than her and although she likes his money, she's very unhappy with their relationship. Predictably, Ned decides to murder Edmund and tells Matty ""the man is going to die for no reason, but we want him dead"".After Edmund is murdered things get progressively more complicated, especially when a Will appears which Ned is supposed to have prepared. Unfortunately, he isn't in a position to declare that he knew nothing about the document because that would be too suspicious. His friends, prosecuting attorney Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and police detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston) are then assigned to the case and gradually, Ned realises that he's been set up. Things then become even more uncomfortable for Ned when his alibi starts to unravel.Some things in ""Body Heat"" are not what they seem to be and these include Matty and the random way in which the couple meet. In common with some other neo-noirs, the action takes place in extreme heat, a heat wave in fact. Perspiration is regularly visible, warm colours are frequently in evidence and the sweltering surroundings seem perfectly appropriate for the passionate storyline and its sultry seductress (a woman who allegedly has a body temperature which runs a couple of degrees high at about a hundred!!!). Additionally a number of large fires are featured.At one point Oscar Grace says ""when it gets hot, people try to kill each other"". This remark is very pertinent because in this movie, the heat certainly seems to ramp up the passion which in turn warps the judgement and leads to murder.William Hurt is very assured in one of his early roles as an incompetent small time lawyer who's also an inveterate womaniser. He's driven by lust and greed and his gullibility makes him easy fodder for the manipulative Matty. Kathleen Turner in her first starring role is brilliant as the devious femme fatale. Her supreme confidence is evident right from the start when she says to Ned ""you're not very smart, are you? I like that in a man"". Importantly, the quality of the contributions made by the supporting cast (including a young Mickey Rourke) is also consistently excellent.What emerges most powerfully from watching this type of updated film noir is just how enduring the appeal of the style remains, how it seems to transcend passing trends and also how strongly audiences continue to respond to the wonderful plots and their devilish twists and turns.",Body Heat
50,mossgrymk,body heat,8,30 July 2021,"This homage to ""Double Indemnity"" forgot the crucial, third leg of the triad, namely Eddie G's doggedly moralistic insurance investigator boss and friend of Fred MaccMurray's corruptible killer. And the tag team of Ted Dancin and J. A. Preston do not offer a compelling, comparable alternative. Without this guy (or gal) all vestiges of humanity disappear and the film becomes a rather cold, repellent, although expertly done, exercise in neo noir. Which is what we have here. So, although the cinematography is fantastic (you can literally feel the warm, humid Florida summer nights even though the movie was shot during winter) and Kathleen Turner is in the Femme Fatale Hall Of Fame, not too far from Liz Scott, Jane Greer and Babs, this is a film where we care not one jot or tittle about what happens to anyone in it. Give it a B plus.",Body Heat
51,bmacv,"A sultry, sweaty update of Double Indemnity",8,11 December 2004,"The coastal Florida town in Lawrence Kasdan's Body Heat brings to mind remote colonial outposts in movies like The Letter (nearby Miami, here, seems as far away as London). A sweltering spell of weather settles down for a long roost, and the distant glow of an old hotel  a relic of the peninsula's past as an exotic getaway for northerners with money  lights the opening scene; it's been torched for the insurance, an occurrence so common as to warrant little comment. It's a town where William Hurt, a lawyer who's neither very bright nor very scrupulous, ekes out a modest existence that seems to suit him; he can dine at the best restaurant in town once a month so long as he doesn't order an appetizer. The rest of his time he spends lazily with bourbon or beer or in bed with whoever obliges him. Then he meets up with Kathleen Turner, who hangs around cocktail lounges when her wheeler-dealer husband (Richard Crenna) is out of town, which is a lot. After the ritual game of cat-and-mouse, Turner and Hurt kindle a torrid romance, despite the enervating heat that keeps everything else limp as dishrags. Soon, the pillow talk works around to murder....Of course, Body Heat is a latter-day version of the story for which Double Indemnity serves as archetype: Duplicitous woman seduces lust-addled stud into killing rich older husband, then leaves him to twist slowly, slowly in the wind. There's not even enough wind to stir the chimes that festoon the porch off Turner's bedroom -- can't the rich old cuckold spring for air conditioning? Hurt and Turner are reduced to emptying the refrigerator's ice tray into the post-coital bath they share -- but Hurt's left twisting nonetheless, in one of the better updates of this ageless tale. In her movie debut, Turner makes her deepest impression with her best asset, that dimple-Haig voice of hers, all silk and smoke (but neither she nor Kasdan, who also wrote the script, quite justify her character's long and intricate back-story of ruthless scheming). With his long, lithe college-boy's build and wife-swapper's mustache left over from the '70s, Hurt embodies the self-satisfied patsy whose zipper leads him through life. Crenna (who played this Walter Neff role in the 1973 TV remake of Double Indemnity) now takes on the role of the disposable husband, the victim (or rather, the first victim).But it's two smaller parts that give the movie a special shine. Mickey Rourke, as the local arsonist whom Hurt once helped out of a jam, ups the voltage in his two scenes, warning the heedless Hurt, then warning him again when it's all but too late. And, as Hurt's amiable adversary in the town's tiny legal circle, Ted Danson proves surprisingly spry and intuitive an actor (and he contributes a lovely little idyll, doing a soft-shoe routine under a street lamp on a pier). There's a twist or two too many in Body Heat -- it's a bit gimmicky -- but, after watching it, you feel as though you, too, should be stripping off your clothes, if only to wring them out.",Body Heat
52,hall895,Overheated,4,7 November 2011,"I've seen this movie before. Except the first time I saw the movie it was called Double Indemnity. And it was a lot better. Writer/director Lawrence Kasdan makes no attempt to hide the fact that he's basically just doing Double Indemnity all over again. He took that movie, sexed it up a bit, added a few twists and ended up with a movie not nearly as good as the one that inspired him. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but Body Heat flatters to deceive. It's an imitation alright but a rather pale one.If you've seen Double Indemnity you already know the plot of Body Heat. There's a woman who wants to kill her husband for his money and there's the poor sap who falls under the woman's seductive spell and finds himself up to his neck in a murder plot. Whereas Double Indemnity made it very clear that it was the woman who hatched the murderous plot Body Heat is a little more vague. Maybe this time it's the woman's new lover who first gets the idea for murder and she's just willing to go along for the ride. This opens up some different possibilities, allowing the movie to retain an air of mystery and to set up some twists and turns at the end. But by the time all is finally revealed it's too late to save this movie. With it having been such a plodding, monotonous journey, and the main characters having so little personality, by the end you probably won't care how it ends. You'll just be glad that it's finally ending.Kathleen Turner plays our mysterious seductress, Matty Walker, and she certainly brings plenty of heat to the role, steaming up the screen in a way her Double Indemnity counterpart Barbara Stanwyck never would have been allowed to back in 1944. But steaminess aside Turner otherwise pales in comparison to Stanwyck. For whatever mystery there may be around her Matty Walker the character has very little life to her. Turner is dry and bland, delivering her lines in snooze-inducing monotone. Her co-star William Hurt comes across no better with his portrayal of sleazy lawyer Ned Racine, Matty's new lover and would-be murder accomplice. Hurt has about as much charisma as a doorknob and the movie never even attempts to justify why Ned is willing to murder for this woman he just met. She can't be THAT good in bed. The plot meanders about with the sense that the movie's just killing time until it finally gets around to killing the husband. Another problem is the movie's score which is loud, obtrusive and obnoxious. Never a quiet moment to let the movie breathe. Then again if your ears weren't constantly being assaulted by the music you might notice that nothing is going on and the director wouldn't want that. In the end there are some rather contrived twists as the movie tries to piece its plot together. There's also Ted Danson, playing a prosecutor, doing a little tap-dance before he tells his friend he suspects him of murder. At that point it becomes rather impossible to take the movie seriously. Kasdan took a classic movie and tried to heat it up. But he overcooked it.",Body Heat
53,johno-21,Not quite a fever but hotter than 98.6º,8,8 March 2006,"I saw this during it's initial release in the theaters and only a couple times since then on TV and it's now been a long time since I've seen this last but a very good movie. Lawrence Kasden's directorial debut, Kathleen Turner's film debut and Mickey Rourke's film debut all in the same film. Kasden wrote this as well in his homage to 1940's film noir features. The dialog both pays tribute to those 40's films in script and spirit and playfully spoofs them as well. Body Heat is a little slow and kind of simple but it has style and a great cast. William Hurt and Katleen Turner complement and play off each other well and Ted Danson turns in a fine performance as does Mickey Rourke and any time Richard Crenna show up in a film you can expect a great performance out of him. Cinematographer Richard Kline's career stalled after this film. He had done such films as Camelot, The Andromeda Strain, Soylent Green, King Kong and Star Trek the Mothion Picture among many others before Body Heat but never would match the success he had with those or with this film again. It's a well done crime thriller and I would give it an 8.0 out of a possible 10.",Body Heat
54,KnightsofNi11,A bit of a letdown,6,30 July 2011,"Body Heat is a film with no fear, making no attempts to shy away from sensuality. William Hurt and Kathleen Turner appear as one of the most seductive on screen couples in cinema history as Ned Racine and Matty Walker. Ned meets Matty one night and after putting forth some effort the two begin having an affair. Ned and Matty eventually fall so madly in love that they conspire to murder Matty's rich husband, Edmund. The murder and the events that follow it spark a chain of events that grow more and more suspenseful as the whole plan caves in around the two lovers. It's a film that prides itself on being a glorious homage to film noir, even if the results aren't completely satisfying.There are moments in Body Heat that I really loved. The suspense is played up excellently and the sensuality combined with the film noir atmosphere was excellent. This is a very moody, very atmospheric, film in general and it never forgets what kind of film it is, but the idea gets old after a while. When the awe towards the zesty and striking mood of the film wears off we are left trying to scramble together the plot which has been developing slowly and twistedly. The plot of Body Heat is a little convoluted as things never really seem to come together. Questions will be raised and the plot will grow thicker and thicker, never solving much of anything and always introducing and reintroducing characters whose motives and purpose we were never quite sure of from the beginning.The whole plot arc of the film isn't bad in theory, but its execution comes through a little hazy, not to mention that there is actually a literal haze over the film which gets a little distracting. Perhaps my problems with this film are all my own fault. I didn't keep up with the story as well as I probably should have and I got lost here and there. Thus I was a little bored at times, wishing the film would pick up and the plot would get somewhere. I'm not positive who is at fault. Me or the film? Either way, my final opinions on Body Heat are less than satisfactory, despite there being some obvious potential in the film.I probably need to rewatch Body Heat and this time keep up with everything that happens in the film and listen closely to every line of dialogue so that I can get the full affect of this film. All I got out of it on my first watch was an engaging atmosphere and some fantastic performances from William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. Other than that the film sort of lost me as I really hoped for more. But I commend it for its efforts and its keen ability to capture an atmosphere that really does work for this type of film, just not as much for me.",Body Heat
55,juliankennedy23,The heat is on.,9,5 November 2006,Body Heat: 9 out of 10: Many successful movies lose their ability to shock over the years. After hundreds of copy cats Alien isn't as effective as when it first came out. Kramer vs. Kramer certainly isn't the shocking eye opener it once was.Body Heat should suffer the same fate. It doesn't. Despite a hundred direct to video takes on the same story (six of them with the exact same title) the movie still works. In fact it works very well indeed.Writer Lawrence Kasdan had just penned Raiders of the Lost Ark and Empire Strikes Back so it is a surprise he chooses noir for his first directing outing. (His next film was The Big Chill so this is one guy hard to pigeonhole) He both updates and in many ways upgrades the noir of the past.By setting the movie in a Podunk Florida town he invokes John D Macdonald the way no Macdonald movie treatment has successfully done. His then unknown actors William Hurt and Kathleen Turner are pitch perfect.This is a movie that really brings some new things to the table as it does some old things very well indeed. Like the best noir you are too involved to even begin to try to guess the next twist and turn.Like Scorsese in Goodfellas or Huston in the Maltese Falcon Kasdan's directing is obviously very good yet his tricks remain hidden from view. Not a wasted shot and your television will sweat from all the heat generated.Highly recommended to all fans of noir or simply fans of movies.,Body Heat
56,itamarscomix,"Entertaining, sexy film noir",7,13 December 2011,"Body Heat doesn't have enough to distinguish itself to be called a classic, but it aged well enough to still be enjoyable and entertaining, which is an achievement that many of the fellow semi-erotic thrillers of the period can't boast. While it was released in 1981, it would be misleading to call it neo-noir; Body Heat is 100% classic film noir, and rather than deconstructing and referencing the genre, it adheres to each of its rules to a tee. In fact, it could have easily been made in the 50's - with the one exception of the nudity and steamy sex scenes, that place it firmly in 80's Hollywood. Naturally, nude scenes of Kathleen Turner do no harm to the film's entertainment value.Body Heat is classy and elegant; the cinematography and especially the acting are good enough that even the sex doesn't feel forced and exploitative. Turner is fantastic, and William Hurt delivers too; Mickey Rourke and Ted Danson are both surprisingly good in smaller but memorable parts. It's hard to avoid a feeling of missed potential, though. The film takes itself much too seriously; a couple of moments almost feel like jab at the staples of film noir (like Danson's ""No, I don't need my own. I'll just breathe the air"" when everybody in the room lights up"") but it's hard to tell if that's ever intentional. My biggest disappointment was with the under-use of the heat motif, which was built up as a driving force of the story in the beginning but wasn't developed in any meaningful way later on. Compare and contrast Do The Right Thing, also set during a heat wave to powerful and intense results. Like everything about Body Heat, it feels right and adds to the atmosphere, but refuses to go all the way.",Body Heat

I pretty much expected a non-stop smut-fest. Well, there was hardly any of that, actually. This is not your explicit sex-drama like Last Tango in Paris; there's a lot of sweating, hot breath, horniness, but enough of a thriller element to keep all that from getting too awkward.Speaking of awkward, I kept getting swept up by Body Heat, when suddenly William Hurt's moustache would creep up and spoil it. Bill just didn't do it for me, and I never really got why he would do it for Kathleen, but I just ignored that personal reaction and found an enjoyable thriller, of the hot-breathed variety.",Body Heat
58,tonypeacock-1,Excellent thriller with a TVM feel,8,5 February 2017,"Surprisingly entertaining early eighties thriller that has more plot twists than an episode of Murder, She Wrote which at times I thought I was watching. It has that made for television feel. Maybe it is because the film is nearly forty years old? It has a stellar cast including William Hurt (not the late John Hurt) as lawyer Ned Racine, Kathleen Turner (Matty Walker - apparently!) in her film debut and Ted Danson with a pre-Three Men and a Baby hairstyle. The plot is very reminiscent of film noir genre. Matty is a female vamp who entraps Ned in a murder/inheritance case with copious amounts of naked shenanigans to make up the screenplay! As well as the copulation a Florida heatwave is behind the film's title. On reading the production team credits I noticed that the music was scored by legendary James Bond composer John Barry. I noticed some strings from the Moonraker score in there. At the time of the film's release in 1981 it was some thirty or forty years since the height of film noir releases. The sex scenes are tame in today's social media driven society but I can imagine they were considered quite 'steamy' at the time. Turner who I have only feint eighties recollections in Romancing The Stone makes a splendid screen debut. A film that is worthy of its quite high ratings.",Body Heat
59,RonellSowes,Adequate But Not That Slick,5,19 July 2021,"I think every neo-noir would be better off if it stopped trying to capture the style of the 40's so much and instead mixed elements from that time with a current style. Body Heat really tries hard to feel like a Double Indemnity(with which it shares some similarities)or any other noir from the 40's and while that style may have worked then, it was also more organic. And in 1981 it just comes across like a little too put on.The film isn't even two hours long yet it feels like it has a lot of uneccasry or redundant scenes. Its flaw isn't that it has two much, but that it does do a quite a good enough job at arranging it. It takes about half an hour to set up its first act when it only really need a fraction of the scenes and time. But once the film does get going it doesn't stall and leaves its initial problems in the dust.With a cast made up of multiple future stars and some decent intelligence, Body Heat is one of the better attempts at a neo-noir; though it still doesn't quite have the slickness of the classics.",Body Heat
60,barryrd,Film Noir in Hot Colour,7,3 April 2007,"This movie is a clever throwback to the film noir classics of the 1940's. I picked up the DVD for $6.99. It was well worth it. The cinematography captures the heat and humidity of a Florida heat wave. (Not all of it from the bodies of the two main characters - Matty and Ned.) The dialogue cleverly works the metaphor of the heat into the steamy affair that Matty (Kathleen Turner) is having with the small-town lawyer (William Hurt). This is one of the earliest films for both Turner and Hurt.Not surprisingly, the plot involves a murder and the contrived entanglements along the way. Not in the same league as Chinatown as a latter-day film noir, it nevertheless holds the viewer's attention through the expected and not-so expected twists and turns. Ted Danson gives a great supporting performance as Ned's drinking buddy. It is hard to shake the image of Sam Malone behind the bar in Cheers but he comes close in this role. Mickey Rourke, one of the brat pack actors from the 80's, also pops up in the film. The film is largely forgotten more than 25 years on (were the eighties that long ago?)but it is still well worthwhile.

They start screwing their heads off and decide that the next logical step would be to re-write her absentee husband's lucrative will and bump 'em off. ""From Here To Eternity"" this is not.Hurt, a thoroughly unbelievable and sleepy lady's man, hawks his unrestrained come ons to Turner's sultry stranger, and hits the jackpot. Despite their near-zero chemistry in the film, writer/director Kasdan nearly makes up for it with setting and atmosphere. A sticky Floridian backdrop adds to their trysts, but that can only carry you so far, as the Idiot Plot kicks in at the second half. Hurt's actions are so carelessly stupid that any of the tricks and surprises of the story are dismissed as plot fodder. Not to mention the redundant and schmaltzy score by the usually reliable John Barry. His opening theme is spot-on, after that it's melodrama-city.Kasdan is obviously a great fan of the noir films he grew up on, and the heightened sex in the film may have been brow-raising in 1981, but even if I had seen it then, it still would've been pure hokum.

However, the entire main cast (J. A. Preston, William Hurt, Kim Zimmer, Richard Crenna, Mickey Rourke and Ted Danson) are just as good.The plot is a remake of the old ""Double Indemnity"" plot from 1944 with a few added twists. Matty Walker meets incompetent Florida attorney Ned Racine (Hurt) and convinces him to kill her wealthy, ruthless husband Edmund (Richard Crenna). Arsonist Teddy Lewis (Rourke) provides an incendiary device to Racine in order to destroy evidence after the murder. Assistant District Attorney Peter Lowenstein (Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (Preston) investigate Edmund Walker's murder and find that an unidentified party (Matty Walker) is providing evidence to implicate Racine in the killing. In the final part of the movie, Matty Walker appears to have been killed in an explosion, but Racine eventually discovers that she has switched identities with and killed old friend Mary Ann Simpson (Zimmer) and has disappeared with the Walker estate money to an unidentified tropic island. Yes, it was really Simpson's body left behind, and Walker gets away with it! Yes, Turner was luminous and breathtaking in her first theatrical movie. Her sensuous manner with underlying evil undertones really makes this film click. The other actors do fine jobs, too. Hurt could have overplayed his dumb attorney role, but is just perfect; Crenna plays a really unlikeable shady businessman; Preston is an idealistic police detective; Rourke is enjoyably slimy as a professional criminal; and Danson provides spark as a public attorney who is friends with Racine and tries to help him, even when the evidence begins to mount.This film has a wonderfully ""natural"" feel, in which everyone is sweating and miserable during a steamy Florida heat wave. The characters talk like normal people do, wear normal clothes, and have the weaknesses that we all have. The music score, especially during the closing credits, is top-notch.

68,fimimix,"..a hot ""10"" if there ever were one...",10,10 June 2007,"...actually, should be 20.......another intelligent movie simply told, relying solely on its attributes.I saw Kathleen Turner (""Mattie Walker"") in ""War of the Roses"" before I saw ""Body Heat""; I picked-up immediately there was a combination of all the ""femme fatales"" in one package. I had forgotten I saw ""Body Heat"" a long time ago: like mostly everyone else, my opinion is this is a film which has not aged one iota.I do not agree Kasden (writer, director) wrote another de riguer version of earlier black-and-white movies using a similar plot; he lucked-up the ""codes"" were no longer enforced. He wrote an up-to-date, ORIGINAL thriller misplaying a talent far greater than all that stuff in ""Star Wars"", etc. (I saw a docu on TCM the about the making of those action-films the same night I saw this movie.......brilliant for their time, showing the difficulty it took to get them made and released.) However ""Body Heat"" has A STORY, told perfectly with a genius we all can relate-to and understand, with a superb cast.....all of them becoming major stars. As it unfolded, I experienced deja' vu, but wasn't really sure.The ""heat"" between Turner and William Hurt (""Ned"") was palpable; with lines like ""maybe you need a tune-up"" (Hurt) and ""she saw oral work on about 7-or-8 inches"" (as told to the DA by the young daughter); Hurt's manly-sexy body; Turner's gorgeous, sensuous body; the subtle-but steamingly realistic sex-scenes; ""Lady, do you want to f--k"" and ""she's trying to f--k me to death"" (both by Hurt). Those lines may be a trifle racy to some folk, but that's the way we speak. The revelation that Tuner and Hurt met the entire crew naked is a shocker. Have you ever known of such daring in ANY other film? Ted Danson (""Lowenstein"") was clever and totally convincing in his role, even with his soft-shoe. Oscar Grace (""J.A.Peterson"") was the savvy detective with affection for the man he knew was guilty; somehow, I missed the planning of the murder, I thought ""Ned"" jealously wanted ""Mattie"" for himself. Mickey Rourke was very believable as the arsonist.....the sets and costumes, cinematography and moodiness, the great acting by everyone in this film certainly makes it one to see over and over.I finally realized I HAD seen ""Body Heat"" before when ""Mattie"" walked toward the boat-house, and intuitively knew she never got there, as ""Ned"" did in jail. We suppose ""Ned"" went to prison, but we knew ""Mattie"" got her wish to be rich, but didn't find happiness even though she got her hubby's money (Richard Krenner) and had another stud on an exotic beach.As ""ribarproductions"" asserts, this movie deserves a sequel, but who would play the roles as well? I don't know of any other actress who can project total sexiness, just by speaking her lines, as Turner did. I'm content to leave at it is and certainly recommend all adults to watch it - as one user wrote, ""with your mistress""........",Body Heat

70,JoshtheGiant,Good Thriller,10,5 February 2006,"Body Heat is more than slightly predictable up until the last ten minutes where it makes many surprising twists and turns and just plain shocks you. The plot is very original for the time Body Heat was made. Now of course it is old standby because so many films copy Body Heat but it was very good and original at the time. The screenplay is similar. It started almost a new genre of films. The dialogue is amazing and has also been copied many times. The performances are all very fine. William Hurt is just plain wonderful in the roll that mad him famous. It may not be his best performance but he is one of the best actors alive and has had better, but it is none the less wonderful. Kathlee Turner is also very good, but she is not quite Hurt. She gives the performance that made her a star and it is easily her best. I had up until now though she was completely lacking in talent and must now say that she is just mostly lacking in talent. The supporting performances are also very good, but not quite that of the leads. The direction is very, very good at times but faltures at times too. Making it I guess decent.

It not only presents a dark tale of greed, duplicity and murder, it goes one better - it does it in full color and with a modern sensibility (1940s femmes fatales never had to take off their clothes). Brilliant script and direction by Lawrence Kasdan, stellar performances by the lead actors, sensuous surroundings, and a hypnotic score by John Barry. In 1981, when this film was released, Baby Boomers were coming into their own and could relate to this updated take on films from previous eras. It's unlikely this film would be made the same way today - younger generations have a frame of reference far removed from this more cerebral approach to entertainment.",Body Heat

Hot Florida, hot swing band in the ampitheatre, lots of smoking, hot Kathleen Turner.  Hot, hot, hot!  Was the movie hot?  For most of it, I was totally engrossed.  There were lots of twists and turns, and the acting seemed first-rate for the direction I thought the plot might travel.  On looking back, I see that I was faked out by many dead ends in the script. Whether that was the intention or not, I don't know, but the finale was anti-climactic.  Giving the supporting players quirks made for some red herrings (like Danson dancin'-- was that intended as well?), but it didn't feel full, just bloated.  Mickey Rourke puts in a great little performance and the normally-annoying Ted Danson drew me some sympathy.  There were many endings that I myself can imagine would have been better.  I still give it 8 out of 10 for a fine noir atmosphere, groovy score, and terrific acting.",Body Heat

The plot is essentially the same as that in ""Double Indemnity"" but this picture moves off in its own direction and builds tension with every scene until the surprise endgame that packs quite a wallop in the best Hollywood tradition. The picture has its own sexy, throbbing pulse and a deceptively leisurely pace that suddenly accelerates at its mid point. Turner and Hurt are so good that they are able to pull off the incredible premise in the manner of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray decades earlier. Ted Danson, J.A. Preston and Mickey Rourke are very good and add to the film's credibility. The movie itself seems to drip with the heat and humidity of south Florida and John Barry's sultry, suggestive music score is a great accompaniment to an excellent film.",Body Heat

The twist was surprising.If you want a suspense thriller where you think you know what is going on, but don't know as much as you thought, this is it.I had seen it before a couple times, but I hadn't seen it in years. Rarely does a movie interest me as much the second or third time around, but this one did. I started thinking about how the writer was leading us along with little bits of information and how the characters were seeing the same. I know Kasden got the the idea from Double Indemnity, but he did a great job with it. The writing was excellent and I don't compliment the writing very often.The pacing was precisely what you would expect from a 1940's style movie as this was. The dim lighting, the lack of cool air in the summer, the sound track - especially the sax - all just right.I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie unless it was just too hot!",Body Heat
75,Benjamin_Cox,"A slick, sexy homage to classic noir movies - 87%",9,20 December 2011,"Noir is the new black. Since the end of the Fifties, Hollywood has never really recaptured that style of film-making where the guys are packing heat, the dames are just as deadly and the cigarette smoke hangs heavily in the air of rain-sodden streets and dimly lit alleys. Noir films offer an appealing mix of sex, glamour and danger and few films since the Fifties have got it right but thankfully, this is an exception. It may be a knowing homage bordering on parody at times but this remains a real gem of a movie, illuminated by a truly brilliant performance from a then-debuting actress.Sleazy small-town lawyer Ned Racine (William Hurt) struggles to cope during a Florida heatwave along with his partner Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson). But Ned is helpless when he spots the sultry Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner) who, despite being married, doesn't exactly put up much of a fight when they begin a torrid affair. As Ned and Matty spend their nights together, they hatch a plot to get rid of Matty's husband Edmund (Richard Crenna) but will they go through with it, especially as Peter's suspicions begin to grow? I can think of few films that convince as well as ""Body Heat"". Everything from the acting to the setting is absolutely top-notch, led by the frankly superb Hurt and Turner. Turner instantly places herself in the Hall of Fame of femme fatales as Matty, as beguiling and bewitching as any of the classics. But our star-crossed lovers are ably supported by the rest of the cast like Danson and a young Mickey Rourke who pops up in a couple of critical scenes. Crenna, who is hardly in the film at all, still manages to provide a memorable performance despite being saddled with fairly dodgy dialogue. The film does feel like its trying too hard to be a Raymond Chandler novel, filled as it is with lines that you'd never hear in real life. It's unashamedly theatrical but it still works. Think of it as Tarantinoesque - it ticks all the genre clichés but isn't weakened because of it. It's reminiscent of other films and somehow, by basking in their glory, it makes ""Body Heat"" even better.What makes ""Body Heat"" really work is that even without trying to be a classic noir film, it remains a thoroughly enjoyable thriller that laid the template for the likes of ""Basic Instinct"", ""Body Of Evidence"" and others. For me, this bridges the gap between the likes of ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Big Sleep"" and more modern films like those I've mentioned. This is a sexy, sultry, steamy thriller that revels in its influences while offering a classic morality tale about the dangers of getting what you want. It's just a shame Turner's career never really matched the magnificence of her debut although if you ever wondered where Jessica Rabbit started out, this is your first port of call...",Body Heat
76,Shostakovich343,Body Heat,5,1 August 2021,"One of the great appeals of traditional film noir is that its perversities remain under the surface -- a side-effect of the Hays Code censure. Lawrence Kasdan's ""Body Heat"" was made under freer circumstances than the classics, and throws the baby out with the bathwater. It takes the sultry undercurrents of its story and puts them into the limelight, only to see them shrivel in the heat of the lamps.""Body Heat"" is an adaptation of ""Double Indemnity"", the James M. Cain novel which Billy Wilder previously made into one of the great American films. The premise remains roughly the same: A lawyer (William Hurt) falls in love with a dangerous woman (Kathleen Turner), whom he promises to help murder her husband (Richard Crenna). The difference lies in the approach. ""Double Indemnity"" has Fred Macmurray and Barbara Stanwyck lure each other with sizzling dialogue (penned by none other than Raymond Chandler), whereas Hurt and Turner bond through lots of sex. ('Hey lady, wanna f---' is one of the film's standout lines.)This carnal approach to storytelling leaves no room for suggestion or interpretation, key elements of a successful ""Double Indemnity"" adaptation. In the original, you can't even say for sure whether the leads had sex. It is part of the stories' boldness how immediately prepared its protagonist is to commit a murder. Stanwyck only drops a hint and Macmurray is already hatching a plan. I like to think he plays a slumbering sociopath, drawn in by the thrill of the kill more than he is by Stanwyck's charms.There is no question what drives William Hurt's lawyer. Kasdan drags us from one sweaty sex scene to the next, and has his characters relay the plot to us in between. The plain vulgarity and casually explained intrigue prevent ""Body Heat"" from becoming anything above a banal thriller. It's certainly no noir.",Body Heat
77,jmillerdp,Luke Warm Steamy Thriller,5,6 August 2013,"The problem with this neo-noir is that, since it so exactly follows the femme fatale formula of classic film noir, you know exactly what's going to happen from beginning to end. How William Hurt's character can't is mind bending! You really want to just yell at the screen at him! Sheesh.Since the plot is a lost cause, what else to consider is the filmmaking. Lawrence Kasdan stymies himself by writing the aforementioned script as he did. So, his direction is only going to be able to do so much, and it isn't enough. John Barry's film score is the clear highlight! It is excellent and atmospheric. But, everything else is very routine.***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)",Body Heat
78,refinedsugar,Ultra Cool,8,2 August 2001,"Usually I find movies date really badly. For instance, John Carpenter's Halloween from 1978 is my favorite horror movie and although I like it a lot, I must admit it's dated badly over the years. No doubt due to the literally graphic changes in horror movies. I was thinking the same thing of Body Heat before I stepped into it. I was aware of such blessings it had been given, but kept in mind it was a product of the early 80's. Surely I thought this must be dated by today's standard of erotic dramas & thrillers. This was not the case.This movie has somehow managed to bypass the aging mechanism that movies succumb to. Twenty years after it's debut it still packs it's erotic punch and twisted bag of lies and William Hurt and Kathleen Turner are still the premiere duo of 'hot legs and ultra cool sleaze bags'. I won't bother giving even a morsel of the story to you - this is one you should walk into completely blind to better you viewing experience. If you need more, check out the plot summary or read the back of the movie box.What I will talk about is the sex scenes. Erotica at it's cinematic best without being crude or pornographic. In today's age of softcore flicks on the video shelves and hardcore pornography conquering new territory every day it's a refreshing change of pace to look back to a movie made in the early 80's and witness such steaminess and tasteful erotica. Not to misdirect your thoughts. This movie isn't solely about sex, but it's a big part in a story of manipulation, money and deceit. The story, the direction and the cast are fit for a picture frame with Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke standing out amongst the supporting cast. A highly recommended view.",Body Heat

Tropical heat plays such a big part in the development of this story that I think it would be a real impairment to enjoyment to see it in a chilly theater. I was hardly familiar with the term ""Film Noir"" in 1981, but this film made clear to me what it meant. The darkness of the story, both psychologically and physically, adds to the suspense and sexual tension of the story, and good direction of great performances finishes the job. Seeing the young, smoldering Kathleen Turner naked is also nice. What can I say? I'm a man. I imagine that women aren't exactly repelled by the youthful William Hurt.I get a huge kick out of the then-unknown Ted Danson in this film, and, of course, Richard Crenna is wonderfully slimy.

80,cashbacher,Hot weather and hotter passion,10,27 November 2019,"The weather is hot and steamy in this story taking place in Florida, but that is topped by the action between attorney Ned Racine (William Hurt) and the irresistible woman Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner). Racine is a single man in a sole proprietorship law firm, doing adequate but hardly spectacular legal work. Walker is married to a very wealthy man that is gone on business most of the time and she is looking for a way out of the marriage. Specifically, one that allows her to keep all of her husband's assets.
Totally infatuated with Walker, Racine decides that her husband must be killed so that the two of them can be together. However, once the deed is done, Racine quickly realizes that he has been manipulated by a master. Given how hot Turner is on the screen, it is easy to see why Racine was thinking with body parts other than his head.
This is a great movie, all aspects of the plot are put into place slowly and effectively before the ending, where things move rapidly. In this role, Turner set the permanent standard for the femme fatale in entertainment. She is a knockout with a ruthless nature, Walker is an incredible combination of beauty and brains.",Body Heat

82,blazesnakes9,One of the best erotic thrillers ever made,10,31 December 2013,"Now, I have to admit something. I do enjoy watching movies that consists on film-noir style. I really do. Like anyone else, I do have my own favorite batch of genres that I like to watch on my own. My favorite genres are action, crime/gangster, science-fiction and western. But, film-noir or neo-noir pictures are essentially one of my personal and favorite one of all. Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote both Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back, written and directed a movie of his own. The name of it? Body Heat. The movie takes place in Florida during an endless, steamy heat wave. Ned Racine (William Hurt), is a seedy lawyer, who can't seem to get his hands off of his female clients. He's the kind of guy that someone would call a sleazeball, yet you know, Ned is a sleazy man, who can't seem to stop doing what he does best. One night, he runs across an beautiful brunette, Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner, in her first movie role) during a outdoor concert. At first, Walker doesn't buy Ned's womanizing tactics and even after her refusal, Ned continues to see her, even though her husband is away. Soon enough, Ned and Matty began to start a steamy and somewhat erotic affair between the both of them. Then, Matty tells Ned that she is planning to kill her rich husband so that she can collect all of the money. Walker's husband, Edmund, (Richard Crenna) soon comes home and doesn't seem to notice the ongoing relationship between Matty and Ned. But, the movie does get interesting when Ned finds himself getting in way over his head about falling in love with Matty. The plot leads to a series of corruption, betrayal and even suspicion when a private investigator suspects that someone kills Edmund. The surprising interest that ignites this movie is the relationship between Ned and Matty, between William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. Their sex scenes are truly well-shot and also very erotic in its own right. Another criticism that I have about the movie is Kathleen Turner. She definitely stole the movie away from all of the other supporting actors. During the whole time when I was watching Body Heat, I was reminded of other femme-fatales that were erected straight out from other 1940's film-noir classics like Double Indemnity, The Asphalt Jungle and Out of the Past. Turner does resembled a lot like a modern femme-fatale of the 80's. The one thing that all femme-fatales have in common that I certainly did see in Kathleen Turner is the lips. Her lips have a red-hot flare to them. Every time a light shimmers over her lips, I was reminded of those 1940's femme-fatales. In fact, Double Indemnity and Out of the Past, the two movies that I mentioned above, were the two movies that were inspired to make Body Heat. But, getting back on Kathleen Turner's performance. She's beautiful to look at and she is also smart in the way that her character can easily manipulate Ned by convincing him to go along with her murder plot. As for the eroticism of this movie, I have to say that it really is convincing and it is sexy. One of the high points in this movie is when Ned looks through the window at Matty and he can't control his lust about her. So, he takes a chair and throws it through the glass window and walks up to her and start kissing her. That is just about as sexy as a movie can go. If you think about it, it isn't played for dirtiness. It isn't trash. It's a neo-noir picture of the 80's. For its time, Body Heat was shocking when it first came out and even today, it is ranked as being one of the best erotic thrillers ever made. In fact, I think that Body Heat helped inspired other neo-noir films of its kind like Blood Simple or The Last Seduction, which was film-noir for the 90's. Furthermore, Kasdan himself feared that he would never make another picture in his career. Lucky for him, his career did expanded with other pictures like The Big Chill and the western Sliverado. His screenplay crackles with high-voltage energy and with star-making performances by Turner and Hurt. Hurt himself is also very convincing as the seedy lawyer who doesn't know what he is getting himself into. Kasdan's direction is also great. He knows how a scene works by letting the characters and the actors talk and communicate through dialogue that literally breaks through like glass. Body Heat proves to be, once again one of the best erotic thrillers ever made. It is well-paced, well-directed with excellent performances by Hurt and Turner and it is one of the films of 1981. Suspenseful and sexy. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Body Heat

It is the ending that let me down somewhat. I just could not figure it out, but that in no way detracts from this films brilliance.

William Hurt has never looked better with or without his shirt on (his best scenes, however, were unfortunately only when his bare chest was in prime display). Being the good actor that he's always been, his part wasn't as meaty as his other parts are (ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, BIG CHILL, JANE EYRE and BROADCAST NEWS immediately come to mind). He's believable as the handsome attorney with one hell of a great body but writer/director Lawrence Kasdan needed just a little more improvement on his character's believabilty.Kathleen Turner (who received the only major award nomination the film received: Best actress (drama) at the golden globes) is the real scene stealer here. Her presence on screen made you feel that all she wanted was to get rid of her weak husband (played rather well in this film by typically less-than-average actor Richard Crenna) and have Hurt's character, Ned, with her and to wake up evey morning with his body lying next to hers. For a while she played it really safe but then by the end of the film you knew he was just a helpless pawn in her clutches who couldn't resist a beautiful woman. Once again, just like in so many other film noir-type movies, the woman takes the man for a sap and gets him by the b***s and then leaves him to suffer the  really, really tough consequences while she gets off scott-free with buttloads of money and no worries.

But a couple of factors give this film a life of its own. The casting is top notch, with a spot on Ted Danson threatening to steal the show as the messenger of foreshadowing, and a small role with Mickey Rourke as an accomplice to arson. And of course, there's Kathleen Turner and William Hurt in what could be considered their finest performances they ever committed to celluloid.In fact, foreshadowing is the name of the game here, as seedy Florida lawyer Ned Racine gradually realizes his fated connection to femme fatale Matty Walker. Shot and structured like an art film, scenes were either carefully rendered with attention to detail, or just the subtle tinkling of piano keys ring ominously throughout that creates a fatalistic atmosphere.The sex and violence is present, but the latter is kept to the bare minimum, and the former is portrayed almost tastefully in its eroticism. The carnal lust that the characters share for one another fits with the film's salacious and 'heated' tone, where morality is blurred and greed overtakes common sense.I figured I could predict how the story would even play out, but I was taken by surprise with a well written twist that plays on the expectations of the viewer, and makes a passionate commentary on the human condition.So after the film was finished, I wasn't left thinking ""So What?"" anymore, so much as ""Man, I wish I could have directed that film.""

Even in 1981, murdering your husband for the inheritance wasn't an original storyline and even more so now with all the American trash that is produced. Whoever thought it would be different by sticking Kathleen Turner's shapely figure into the equation was wrong. The acting, as with all soap operas, is poor. William Hurt's capabilities were shown up at the end, as he just couldn't handle the final moments of the film. His only motivation for this project seemed to be the constant clinches with Turner(but who can blame him).Overall, this is just another episode of Diagnosis Murder with a bit more flesh. Grossly overrated at 7.4/10. I give it a 6 - 5 for Kasdan's direction, 1 for Turner.",Body Heat
95,roger-pettit1,A very enjoyable film noir that keeps one guessing right until the end,9,14 February 2012,"Body Heat is one of the most entertaining films that I have seen in a long time. It is film noir for the modern era. It has something about it that brings to mind another film of much the same vintage - Jagged Edge (with a performance by William Hurt to match that of Jeff Bridges). Body Heat is also reminiscent of that classic film noir of the 1940s - Double Indemnity.Ned Racine (Hurt) is a somewhat inept and dishonest lawyer in a small town in Florida. He has a history of making careless errors and not always representing his clients' interests to great effect. He meets and becomes infatuated by bored housewife Matty Walker (played by Kathleen Turner), who lives in an opulent detached house and whose wealthy husband is away at work during the week. Ned and Matty begin an affair. Very soon, their thoughts turn to getting rid of Matty's husband - so they plan what they think is the perfect murder. But, of course, things do not go according to plan and, anyway, are not always quite what they seem. Body Heat is a very stylish, atmospheric film. It boasts dark lighting and sultry locations, with a jazz soundtrack to match. All the principal characters smoke heavily. And there are some steamy sex scenes involving Hurt and Turner. The plot is complex. It starts slowly but gathers pace perfectly before reaching an unexpected conclusion via a number of twists and turns. The acting, direction and screenplay are spot on. Given the quality of the performances by its two leads, it would be easy to overlook the sterling support provided by the likes of Ted Danson, JA Preston and a young - and almost unrecognisable - Mickey Rourke (in what must have been one of his first films). Body Heat is splendid entertainment. 9/10.",Body Heat

Wonderfully directed by Lawrence Kasdan, you can feel yourself sweat as he spreads out his story amid the sultry Florida summer. Purposely convoluted and full of plot lines that will keep you on edge. Famous for its scene of Hurt watching Turner through her glass doorway like a lion stalking its prey. His breaking through that door is just what Turner wants, and just what the viewer needs to find themselves entranced by this script. Ted Danson is good as the sympathetic friend, and Richard Crenna, always fun to watch, is his old pro self.

The supporting actors, Mickey Rourke in particular, do outstanding jobs. The main draw to the film, though, is the writing. This movie actually has a PLOT! (would-be screenwriters take note). The final few scenes of the movie do an excellent job of tying up all the loose ends of the story, though it's such an intricate tale, you may be forced to rewind and see some scenes over again to fully appreciate what really happened.

105,pderocco,Score!,10,5 June 2003,"This is a wonderful movie, if you like noirish mysteries. Other comments have already detailed the twists of the plot, and recognized the debt the movie owes to the noir genre in general, and to ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" in particular. But this movie, standing on those shoulders, really does reach new heights.Here's one telling example. In ""Double Indemnity,"" there's a nerve-wracking scene in which Fred MacMurray is forced to confront the one witness who may expose him as the killer; this situation is inadvertently arranged by Edward G. Robinson, playing the insurance investigator, who doesn't suspect his friend MacMurray in the least. Body Heat has an analogous scene, but here the confrontation, which threatens to expose William Hurt, is orchestrated by his friends, the prosecutor and the cop, who we know already suspect him. They even offer to let him leave by the back exit, but he knows he's being tested. The tension in this scene is twice what it is in ""Double Indemnity,"" and it's an example of the first-rate acting and direction that we see in a tight shot of Hurt's face the merest flicker of terror as he realizes the gauntlet he is about to walk.This was Kathleen Turner's first movie role. I've never been that impressed by her acting ability, but here her limitations map perfectly onto the role of an insincere woman who pretends to be in love merely to entrap William Hurt into her scheme. I never was that fond of Lana Turner, either, but in the same way, her inability to be an utterly convincing actress was actually an advantage in conveying the phoniness and fraudulence of the conniving wife in ""Postman.""But the best thing about Body Heat is the ending. Five minutes before the credits, we're sure the story is over and we're into the wrapup--after all, we've seen movies like this before--but then, in one final killer twist, everything is upended, and we see that the there is much more to this plot than we had realized. The clues had been there, but in the end, we discover that we've been as gullible as William Hurt's character, and we're bowled over by the truth that's finally revealed. This movie will leave you thinking for a long time.",Body Heat

107,charishankar,Noir.. Period.,5,12 September 2012,"Paeans have been sung about Kathleen Turner's seductive debut in this 1981 thriller, as the quintessential femme fatale. Many superlatives have been heaped on her. Quite frankly, I found her to be the greatest weakness in a film which could, with a more ""fragile"" heroine, have worked much much better.For, the moment you set your eyes on her in her very first scene in the film, you know nothing good can come of associating with Matty Walker, whom she portrays. She spells trouble with a capital T in every scene, and that, unfortunately, is where the film falters. You can never like her at any point, and that makes her entire part eminently predictable - I could figure out nearly every scene of the film before it actually took place on the screen.William Hurt, too, is adequate, but seems, at points, to overplay his part as the confused, indeterminate lover, with whom you are never quite able to empathize, principally because he is, to put it bluntly, such a wimp. He lands himself in deep trouble, and, unfortunately, you are left with the uncomfortable feeling that he entirely deserved it.The principal failing of this film, therefore, is essentially that the main characters are all black or white, with no hint of grey showing anywhere. No harm in that; provided it's not so glaringly apparent, and the roles are more subtly drawn out, which is what a great thriller fundamentally needs. This aspect of subtlety, unfortunately, is completely absent here.And yet, it's not a complete wash-out - the plot is reasonably engaging, and Ten Danson, in a bit part as Hurt's prosecuting attorney friend, puts up a wonderfully nuanced performance. It would not be too much to say that at least 3 out of the 5 points which I am reluctantly giving this movie deserve to be credited to him.It's noir; ergo, it's watchable. Period.",Body Heat

109,ShempMyMcMalley,It's getting hot in here...,9,20 June 2008,"(Possible Spoilers) 'Body Heat' is a complete success as an archetypal neo-noir, with all the classic elements. It is a virtual remake of 'Double Indemnity' of 1944, and in many cases, is just as good. It is said early in the movie that the stuffy and hot temperature can make people do crazy things, and this imagery serves the erotically charged indiscretion between Turner and Hurt very well (this film is what 'Basic Instinct' tried to be). Turner is sultry and seductive as the quintessential femme fatale and a good yin to Hurt's yang, a naive lawyer willing to do whatever it takes to get the girl. Also, possible more importantly, her husband's fortune. But as we know, the scheming noir protagonist's dream seldom takes hold and there are dire consequences. For when Hurt arrives at Turner's house early on, the camera focuses on her many wind chimes shuffling in the wind, as if to suggest that the bells have tolled for him. This film succeeds on all levels: story, acting, direction, dialogue ('Why don't you lick it off?') and the imagery is impeccable. Morever, this is a film that claims to be erotic, and actually pulls it off wonderfully, a rarity when mixed with brains too.",Body Heat

The sex scenes were defiantly steamy, especially for the time the movie came out. Hurt and Turner were both quite hot and sexy. About half way through the movie the story really picks up and makes this a movie worthy of viewing. However, I did feel like there were some holes in the story.

113,danielefanin-17409,A Searing and Sweating Movie,8,6 June 2020,"Body Heat was the launchpad for both director Lawrence Kasdan and the lead characters, Kathleen Turner, that with her debut film became overnight the prototype of the sensually perfect dark lady, and William Hurt, who after the good reviews for Ken Russell's Altered States the year before, rose to a sex-symbol and stardom status that propelled him to the well-deserved Oscar for Kiss of the Spider Woman four years later.Graced with excellent supporting roles by Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke and a sensually evocative soundtrack by John Barry, Lawrence Kasdan's first direction, after a solid screenwriting apprenticeship, is an open and devout tribute to the noir movies of the '40s and '50s, most of all Double Indemnity, of which it follows the structure as well as the use of a legal twist, though it cannot be plainly considered a remake.
Bearing in mind the almost forty years elapsed between the two movies, Body Heat contains some aspects that are even more interesting than its source, in particular for the different connotation of the two main characters: Kathleen Turner, both for her physicality and her sulky voice, later memorably lent to Jessica Rabbit, looks more convincing and irresistible than Barbara Stanwick and William Hurt is definitely less self-assured than Fred MacMurry but at the same time more defenseless and exposed, unable to come to terms with the end of his distorted dream even when faced by an unmistakable reality. Moreover, the immoral ending, where evil boldly triumphs, gives the film a deep bitterness that Double Indemnity in the '40s most likely could not have because of the times ,but that makes Lawrence Kasdan's movie even more real and resounding.But what stands out in Body Heat is the physical presence of the weather in which the story unfolds; Body Heat is not only a movie to watch and listen, is also, in a very rare way, a film to ""sweat"", for the constant, intrusive and pervasive presence of the Florida's searing heat that becomes a further, and dominant, character in the movie's developments, unavoidably carrying the protagonists to their pre-written destiny.
Maybe only Bogart's films like The African Queen or Key Largo were able to reach such interpenetrating mix, and this is to be seen as an additional merit of Lawrence Kasdan, who was one of the most interesting directors of the '80s (The Big Chill, Accidental Tourist) before getting somehow lost in the '90s, till almost disappearing after unassuming films like The Dreamcatcher and Darling Companion.",Body Heat

Things aren't spoon fed. You're not treated like an idiot, you're left to glean from context the subtleties of character interactions. Some moral complexity, protagonists who do the wrong thing, a villain(ess) who is so convincing even you the viewer, knowing she's the bad guy, are half convinced by her lies.

A lesser director would have packed this film with one nude scene after another, and included endless sex scenes with Ms. Turner outfitted in garter belts, diaphanous nightgowns, and anything else to insure that the audience understood Ned's sexual obsession with Maddy. As it was, she wore a floor-length terrycloth bathrobe, and her street clothes were discreet, even modest -- no skin-tight blouses cut down to her navel, or pants that looked like she was poured into them. I liked the friendships Ned had with the prosecutor, played by Ted Danson, and the police detective, played by J.A. Preston. They seemed like real people who knew and liked each other, and their conversation in the diner was realistic and amusing. Richard Crenna, one of my favorites, also did a great job with his portrayal of the venal, self-satisfied Edmund Walker who thinks he has Maddy in his hip pocket. I like the scene where Maddy bumps into Ned unexpectedly in the restaurant and quickly introduces him to Edmund as ""Mr. Racine"", then says, ""I'm sorry, I don't know your first name"".

117,dane-31,A great Film!!,9,10 January 2007,"Laurence Kasdan's amazing Neo-Noir film is, in my opinion, a wonderfully-crafted psychological Thriller. Although the film has some witty elements, it is also a deeply somber film of the consequences from ignoring Intuition and Conscience, as well as the insufferable damages of a relentlessly greedy woman. The ending of the film is brilliant, leaving a feeling of dread, and an atmosphere of stark psychological anxiety, while still maintaining it's smooth trademark style and photographic beauty. I found myself very disappointed in many of the viewer's comments on the film; people only seeming to remember the Sexual scenes and the scenes of witty dialog. Yes, I understand that a film like this may resemble many of the qualities of the classic Noirs, but in no way is it meant to be a spoof or a remake, it simply pays Homage to them, not mimic them. Yes, many of the elements of the film are similar to the classic Noir's of the 1950's we all may know, but it was obviously not the intention of the director to imitate those films, he was simply using the necessary conventions of the genre to give the film perspective/genre. In other words, all of the obviously desensitized and cynical reviewers can get your feet out of your mouth, and stop depreciating a truly good film as a fascicle. In looking at the film in and of itself, it stands for it's own, carrying it's own weight with grace and true style. How about appreciating the film as a whole!!

That's probably exactly what Lawrence Kasdan (writer/director) wants you to feel.I especially liked the characters of Ned's friends, Oscar and Lowenstein, played very well by their respective actors. They care about him, yet act as a sort of Cassandra, telling him of imminent danger, which he of course ignores.Oscar's line of ""because of the heat, people go crazy- they think that the ordinary rules don't apply"" is very prescient.

He had a string of well played roles in the '80s (Kiss of the Spider Woman, Children of a lesser god, Gorky Park) but his movie career lost momentum after that. Perhaps it's difficult for a cerebral actor like him to find challenging parts. Turner is super sexy, proving that a voluptuous figure or great facial features are not essentials to be a turn on. I hear that Body Heat was her first film. She plays her role with understated confidence.The underrated theme music too is very good. Supporting cast is effective. Really no faults with this movie. Kasdan did an accomplished job. One can't help but be disappointed that he did not make many more good movies.Some leading critics complain that the ending was over elaborate. I disagree. I think the ending touch works well with the atmosphere and momentum of the movie towards the end. This being a genre film noir movie, the plot is typical and familiar to almost anyone, but it still has great power and the movie irresistibly sucks the viewer in.

Originally described as a modernization of the 1944 film noir classic, ""Double Indemnity,"" it now stands on its own as a 'must see' film. Driven by the moody soundtrack of John Barry, there is little to fault in this tale of lust, deception and murder. On first take, it appears that Kathleen Turner takes William Hurt to the cleaners and sends him to prison as the killer of her rich husband. She has planned out the scam to perfection, leaving Hurt in a world of hurt as he rots in prison and she escapes with a fortune to an exotic island far, far away. However, I believe the end of the movie reveals Turner is actually in love with Hurt, the victim of her deceptions, and thus, she is doomed to misery.

The reason why she is so unhappily married is because her husband only gets to be with her on the weekends. And she wants to get his wealth the quickest as possible. Since a divorce is long and painstaking, she would result in a extreme matter: MURDER!Racine's fellow lawyer(Ted Danson) checks out Matty and tries to warn him about getting involved with her.With such a cast, it's worth the effort. Ted Danson has given his all after his 1979 debut on ""The Onion Field"" playing Officer Ian Campbell. In ""Body Heat"" he has more pep in his step when he does his little dance on the pier.Five years later, there is another Southern erotica film called ""Blue Velvet"". Put that in your collection.Getting involved in something heavy is murder, and this movie is not made for people who can't take the heat.A classic!4.5 out of 5 stars!",Body Heat
128,Ivarq,The heat is on.,6,2 January 2006,"There are all the elements of a good mystery-thriller but there is romance also. When the film begins the two characters meet but it seems it's going nowhere. It only seems so until the Matty Walker/Mary Ann Russell (Turner) finally seduces the overheated Ned Racine (Hurt) Certainly there is chemistry between Hurt and Turner. Some of the scenes between them were so intense it can be felt. The co-actors are fine too, there is Mickey Rourke for example. And it is totally 80-s. The clothing (Costume design is by Renie Conley, whom we know from Kleopatra and The three faces of Eve) and cars. But it doesn't mean it is dated, instead it feels stylish. Not to mention the smooth score of J.Barry.",Body Heat
129,pdmh48,Matty the betrayer,9,15 June 2005,"SpoilersI saw this when it first came out, on a cold day in February (it didn't seem quite so cold leaving the theater, as it did going in. Nice touch releasing it in the throes of an icy winter!) I remember an audience member shouted out ""Wow!"" as the credits rolled. I am always impressed by this film.Just as Ned was in the movie,I am fascinated by the relentless Matty.The enormity of her lies, even the smaller ones, such as ""He is small and weak."" when referring to her husband (who is not small or weak at all, and sizes Ned up right away when they meet in the restaurant. Was he expecting Ned to appear sooner or later? He had a gun that Matty wasn't aware of. Just a thought.)and all that sexual manipulation of Ned is intriguing. Matty proved that she knew the ""bottom line."" She fulfilled her dream as stated in her high school yearbook-""To be rich and live in an exotic land."" (Notice her nickname, too-""The Vamp."")While it was a terrible thing to do to the men in her life, the film noir genre had prepared us for that. I was shocked that she betrayed her ""lifelong"" best friend. Maybe it's because I've been blessed with wonderful girl friends in my life, but that was cold! This put a different twist on the genre.Matty got away with it, all right, but her expression in the last scene is so great. What is she thinking?",Body Heat

Ted Danson before Cheers. Screen sex at its non-porn but highly charged best. Excellent cinematography, excellent characters. Not a single unneeded scene. And a surprise ending. You can't ask for more from a film. A film noir style, but using color, and set contemporary (post WWII and before the Iraq debacle.

The camera-work was great. Check out an early scene in the film when the camera starts behind the bar and slides around to follow William Hurt outside where he lights up and strikes a perfect pose leaning against the doorway like Bogart or someone from one of those forties films. Wonder how many takes that took. Hurt puts in a great performance. The fact that his character is called Ned Racine gives him a head start but it's a very challenging role to portray a guy who is at the same time dynamic, lazy, naive, charming and likable. All the performances are top drawer. Kathleen Turner does a great job as the femme fatale. Mickey Rourke is in just two scenes but grabs your attention in both. Ted Danson and JA Preston are good as Ned's friends. Richard Crenna plays the kind of assertive character he played in Rambo,which fits in here as he delivers a pivotal line which sums up the story.('You've got to know the bottom line')",Body Heat

He may just qualify as being a human being, but if he has ever shown an emotion, please point it out. This tedious film bored me rigid. HURT bored me rigid. Why was this piece of crap made? If anyone can offer a solution then please proffer it up with your Hurt-emotion suggestion. Then there was all that sweating! Is that why i hated it? No, no. The sweating was ghastly, but i hated this film because it was a very, very, bad film.Sleep-inducing rot.",Body Heat
134,kennethwright45,Evil under the Florida sun,6,22 September 2003,"Body Heat is a watchable but inferior neo-noir homage to the ""darling, let's kill your husband"" adultery classics Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice - mainly Double Indemnity. Although the premise is the same in all three films, the plot details are too diverse for Body Heat to be called a remake of either of the older features; however, almost every significant character in Double Indemnity has his or her parallel in Body Heat, which one can't say of The Postman Always Rings Twice. The 1981 film's biggest problem is a structural one: the first act, setting up the motive of sexual obsession, goes on far too long. The reason it goes on so long is its second problem: too much explicit sex. This isn't a prudish complaint, but a dramatic one. Explicit sex is dramatically null because it practically never advances the story and it seldom even illuminates character; usually it just stops a film dead, and the longer it goes on, the deader it stops it. (It also alienates those viewers, such as myself, who don't care to be invited to be voyeurs.)Consequently, Body Heat - a densely plotted film even by noir standards - is left with an awful lot of plot to pack into its second act, and the second half's dialogue and structure suffer from the need to make every line and scene contribute to the explication. A complicated story isn't a bad thing in itself. If it's clearly told - as in David Mamet's labyrinthine House of Games - we can follow it first time around. To say that the plot of Body Heat needs several viewings to be understood, as some reviewers on this site have quite rightly said, is not really a compliment.  To look on the positive side, which involves overlooking the blandness of William Hurt and Kathleen Turner's performances (compare them with the guilt-fired sexual derangement of Lana Turner, Fred MacMurray and John Garfield in the older films), there are good things about Body Heat. Ted Danson plays the film's most amiable role, that of Hurt's best friend, almost as touchingly as Edward G Robinson in the corresponding part in Double Indemnity. Mickey Rourke reminds us poignantly of the years when he was a very good actor. The Florida-summer setting is effectively employed as a perverse, ironic reversal of the traditional noir backdrop of darkness and rain. And it has aged gracefully: nothing about it screams 1980s! at you.
The film as a whole is a professional, intelligently manufactured piece of work that sets out to entertain a grown-up audience. That it looks like a classic to so many film fans today, however, is mainly a comment on how limited and juvenile are the ambitions of mainstream Hollywood cinema less than one generation later.",Body Heat
135,Schmoozette,"Good Neo-Noir, but a Couple of Things Bugged Me",8,23 July 2021,"OK, so at 25:38 Ned does the macho man thing and smashes in a door of the fancy-schmancy house to get to Matty. And nothing's done about the repair? Could it have been done in time before the husband returned? Wouldn't he have noticed the damage? Or repair? It just bugged me for the rest of the movie.Also, how would Lowenstein know that Ned would be running at night so that he could ""meet"" him on the dock? I mean, the Fred Astaire touch was nice, but the timing made no sense to me.One interesting plot point: In this movie, Ned told Matty not to be greedy and settle for half (of course, she didn't want to). But in ""Double Indemnity"" (which I adore), it was Walter Neff who convinced Phyllis to go for a plot that would trigger the double indemnity clause.Finally, Matty was walking toward the boat house and managed to trigger the explosion that killed not-her. How? And how did she manage to walk away uninjured? She didn't have any detonation on her, and we know that she asked to be shown how to ""rig it to the door, with a little delay"" (so when Ned walked in, according to her scheme, ka-boom). But the delay doesn't make sense if she thought she was killing Ned. Could she have opened the door and run fast and far away enough to not be caught by the explosion? Inquiring minds want to know.Those are my observations in what otherwise is a fairly nifty neo-noir. And Mickey Rourke was nothing less than fabulous in that small, but key, role.",Body Heat

I can immediately tell why people consider it a remake of Double Indemnity but unlike Gus Van Sant who remade Psycho shot by shot and casts Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates in a massive piece of miscalculation, or Jonathan Demme who remade Charade as The Trouble With Charlie and casts Mark Whalberg in the Cary Grant role, Mark Whalberg! In ""Body Heat"" Lawrence Kasdan casts William Hurt in the Fred Mac Murray part of the insurance salesman falling into the trap, body and soul. William Hurt's phenomenal performance reinventing the character makes ""Body Heat"" unique and without precedent. The power of Kathleen Turner - bursting into the film scene with a bang! - it's a masterpiece of characterization. She's way ahead of William Hurt. ""You're not very intelligent, are you?

That's why I called this a period peace, not in the sense of an ""historical drama"", but as what Harold Bloom called period pieces: works that were hyped in their time but are or will be forgotten thereafter. It's clearly what Body Heat is: a clearly so-so movie that due to the trend of neo-noirs and the sex became hyped.
And the acting when it's not awful is just average. It's been a long time since I saw another Kathleen Turner movie so I don't remember if she improved, but her acting is so awful that's on par with Ariane from The Year of the Dragon. Most of the time while I was watching this movie I was thinking if I should stop or keep on going.

Taking as starting point the leit motif of The Postman always rings twice, Kasdan sets alive a fascinating history incredibly well performed, and Kathleen gets into the stardom pantheon forever, displaying not only a talent hardly equallable, but also a kind of elegant sensuality and sexuality which Sharon Stone would have a lot of learn from eleven years after. William Hurt is great too, as the victim of a plot that entangles everyone who sees the film twenty one years after with a freshness hardly found today.

While I was watching Body heat, I couldn't keep myself from doing other things, because it was a bit boring at times. It is set in Florida under a heat wave, and the movie is hot at times.

Looking back, it's a little amazing that so many major stars engaged in full nudity, back of the body nudity, or simulated sex back then. As I've matured I'm glad to see less emphasis on sex and more on romance - things were spinning out of control by the time Basic Instinct hit the screens.Anyhow, having seen Body Heat on video recently, I'm pretty sure they snipped out the heaviest nudity from the original film. Too much risk the kids will walk in the room, I guess! But it has altered the shock value and character of the film. Kathleen Turner was a real turn-on back then and unfortunately modern audiences will not realize that. Am I remembering it wrong, or do other people agree with my assessment?",Body Heat
150,johnnyaction80,When it gets so hot all you can think about is sex and murder...,9,5 July 2004,"Spoiler.... Has film noir ever been this film noir. Elements of film noir. Dark? Check. Heat? Yep. Sex? Uh Huh. No character is happy in the end? Yeah. Chain Smoking, drinking, murder, sweaty bodies on top of each other? Body Heat has an abundance of all of this. Plus it launches the careers of Kathleen Turner, William Hurt, and Lawrence Kasdan. Body Heat is one of those films that puts a new spin on a genre that has been around for a long time. It takes these elements of film noir and uses them in a fashion that lets the characters poke fun at it. For example Hurt's character Ned Racine lights up immediately after jogging, while he is still heavily breathing. When everyone lights up in a meeting discussing Turner's characters, Matty Walker, husband's will, Ted Danson declines disclaiming he'll just breath the air. Racine's friend, the detective, says when it gets so hot people think the rules don't apply to them, that if they break the rules nobody will notice. Well that's where they are wrong because this detective is on the case. You do the crime your gonna do the time buddy. Unless your an extremely sexy widow. Matty Walker gets away with murder, all her husbands money, and putting a semi-innocent man behind bars. But is she happy; hell no. She is sitting on a tropical island paradise stuck in misery. Why? Because the one that can give her the good lovin' is rotting behind bars. Just think how moopy she would be if her original plan had worked and she had killed him. When we are talking about classic film noir. The genre was created (for us Americans) during the production code era of Hollywood. This meant there was no crime unpunished. If you murdered someone then you were going to die or go to jail, those were your two options. Now of course there are no rules, just a rating system. The audience has been following Ned Racine the whole film. Even though Racine is a shady character, sex with random women, constant drinking, handling guilty clients, adultery, jogging and chain smoking, and of course murder, we still like him. Racine is our host to this film and we don't want to see him do jail time. To bad that's what happens, but the antagonist loves him. If the protagonist loses in the end it's still satisfying if the antagonist loses as well and especially interesting if what she loses is the protagonist. It's really satisfying at the end to have the surprising relief that Matty didn't get everything she wanted.Minus the sex and nudity, this film would have arguably fit perfectly in the production code era because everyone that does something immoral gets their's in the end. The main characters are both trapped, imprisoned, only one prison is in a tropical paradise that serves fruity drinks.",Body Heat

I think you could get William Hurt and Kathleen Turner to reprise their roles. I'm not sure either one is overly busy at this point. I don't as a rule like sequels, but the movie always left me with the thought, ""Now what?"" Mattie probably is off on some South Pacific island.

159,Dave-423,It's beautifully sensual and tragically haunting.,10,14 February 1999,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  The setting, storyline and characters are brilliantly interwoven with steamy passion, intrigue and suspense. Matty is the ultimate femme fatale. Her coolness and beauty are so compelling that we completely understand Ned's infatuation.  Their torrid lovemaking scene is famous for its lust and passion.  However, what's often overlooked is the warmth, tenderness and affection that they later display toward each other.  Her vulnerability is so sweet and touching that it's gut wrenching when Ned (and we) slowly come to the realization that her love, innocence, and promises are only an illusion, and that he's being lured into a hopeless trap. Even when the truth begins to unfold, her spell over him is so powerful that he continues hanging on to the belief in her sincerity. He's in denial until the very end, and he admits, ""She was relentless.""   As each event unfolds, the theme music haunts us with an eerie foreboding.  On one hand, its dark sensuality sooths and seduces us; on the other hand, it warns us of something dangerous, something forbidden. I find it is the perfect background for this beautiful-dream-turned-into-a- nightmare-hell for Ned, who brings this tragedy onto himself due to his fatal flaw:  lack of integrity.  Seeing Matty on a tropical beach at the end haunts me, for I am mesmorized by her seductive beauty, awed by her genius and chilled by her deadly willingness ""to do whatever it takes"".",Body Heat

It was later determined that before and during the trial she was having an affair with the prosecuting attorney. Her picture ran in the Palm Beach Post and she was no Kathleen Turner but John Sweet who, I believe, was convicted, and the D. A. must have thought differently.

162,brissie,"A film for adults, not teenagers",8,22 August 2008,"Do you need a spoiler alert in 2008? Watch the film first, eh.Body Heat is an odd little gem found, in my case, with no preamble on late-night TV. What's this, I thought? William Hurt in a 1940s-era film, complete with long sleeves/tie/hat in a sweltering heatwave? But the cars looked vintage 1970s, as did the phones. So where was the aircon? Obviously a contrived plot device to emphasise the oppressive nature of the heat, climatic and climactic, and one that irked me throughout. Clearly the director wanted a film noire atmosphere and it generally worked. Except for the lack of aircon!Anyway, I loved the initial verbal tango between Hurt and Turner. When Hurt tries to strike up a conversation with Turner, she tells him she's not looking for company. He asks what that means. I'm a married woman, she says. Then you should have said 'happily married' he replies. That's my business, says she. What is, he wants to know. How happy I am, is the reply.How could you not love a film like this?Admittedly, the similarity with the famous film noire titles (Double Indemnity; The Postman Always Rings Twice) made me feel as if I'd seen the film before. But Body Heat was sufficiently engrossing--and Hurt was sufficiently compelling, despite being the ostensible bad guy--to keep me watching to the end. Really felt for the Hurt character as he began to realise that the infatuation in his life--the woman for whom he became a murderer--had cold-heartedly framed him.Then, later, when he found that telltale wire on the door, he learned that she had set a bomb to murder him. He knew all this when she returned to the house and, recovering quickly from not finding the shed burning and emergency crews out the front, professed to love him and promised that they would now have everything they wanted. Broke my heart to see the look on his face as he witnessed her treacherous performance while still, deep down, being in love with her. Wonderful performance, and all the more powerful because he didn't resort to the stereotypical rage/swearing/violence so often expected of male characters showing great emotion.Anyway, I love William Hurt in virtually everything, although I was never a Kathleen Turner fan. Know her mainly from Romancing the Stone, and confuse her with Cybill Shepherd. Except, as I've now learned from Body Heat, Turner is the one with the tiny breasts. So now I can tell the two apart :-) If you've noticed an absence of detail about the Turner femme-fatale role it's because, until the last scene, the story is told from Hurt's perspective and all we know of her is what he knows. So she's pretty much a mystery to us too. I honestly think any cool blonde could have played this role adequately, although Turner does have that seductively deep voice. Plus, I'm a Hurt fan and so possibly a little biased.The supporting cast is a treat too. We were well into the film before I began wondering why the Ted Danson character looked familiar. Wow, he was so young and lithe then. (There's an understated but touching moment when he warns Hurt that he's under suspicion. Rather than feeling anger at being deceived by Hurt, he projects disappointment and sadness, as if he's lost a good friend.) And who was that ex-convict and expert on arson? Mickey Rourke. I'd heard he'd been good-looking in his youth and this film confirms it. (What happened to you, Mickey?) Only two scenes and yet every line he utters sounds utterly compelling.The film is dated in the most wonderful sense: it gives you a taste and feel of what modern film noire could have been like if Hollywood hadn't discarded real storytelling for graphic violence and special effects. In other words, a film for adults at heart, not 50-year-old teenagers.",Body Heat
163,beherenow10,It's OK. Not terrible but not great.,5,2 November 2010,"I saw this in the early 1980s when I was in my early 20s and liked it much better then than I do now after watching it again recently. Not sure why I like it so much when I was younger. It's full of clichés, tries too hard to be stylish or stylized, and I think they tried too hard to make it like the 1940s movies, although it was set in the 1980s. Another thing. About the Florida heatwave they are experiencing in the movie. Throughout the movie they are sweating and suffering from the heat of the heatwave. In every location where they were, windows are wide open and ceiling fans blowing. They take ice-water baths to escape the heat. This was very unrealistic. I lived in Florida in the 1980s and pretty much the entire summer is a heatwave, and very humid. But guess what? WE HAD AIR CONDITIONING! Air conditioning was a staple of every day life in Florida in the summer in the 1970s and 1980s. None of them have air conditioning in the movie, not even the rich lady in the mansion. And all the times they complain about the heat while they are sweating indoors, air conditioning is never even mentioned. These people on ""Body Heat"" are apparently living in a Parallel universe 1980s Florida that does not have air conditioning.",Body Heat
164,jsheevc17,One of the greats that has stood the test of time....,10,8 October 2005,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The atmosphere is terrific. A small town in Florida during a summer heat wave. William Hurt has never been better than in this role as a very likable guy that does something very bad. Almost no matter what wrongs you have done in your life this movie will make you feel a little better. Body Heat also has the benefit of having one of the great soundtracks by John Barry in my opinion. The title song is transcendental if you like smoky Jazz. The sex element isn't that important to me here because as great as Kathleen Turner is in the movie she just isn't that much of a siren to me. Beautiful in that cheerleader way though...yes. Ted Danson is terrific and funny in his supporting role. After watching this movie several(dozen) times I've found what I think are several semi-hidden clues to indicate the direction things are going in Body Heat. Some of them are more obvious like a shot of a spider web. Others are a lot more subtle. I found these to be a lot of fun. Ultimately the fact that William Hurt gets caught up in something so horrible and still remains likable is one of the greatest things about the movie. I think the movie shows us that a lot of us could end up like Ned Racine if our lives unfolded in a certain way.,Body Heat
165,user-597-207773,Misc.,9,1 February 2013,"johnnyaction80, I don't agree that Matty was necessarily pining for Ned at the end. She didn't seem very happy, but it was never clear that she wasn't just acting when she was with him. If the movie was trying to show her as regretting her choice for money over him, I think it should have been more explicit. Maybe it could have shown her as treating her new man differently.If Lawrence Kasdan accounted for the difference between ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" I like him.Nimbo, I read either on this site or Wikipedia that he said ""it's very hot"" in Portuguese, suggesting they were in Brazil.",Body Heat

167,splaticus,The soundtrack/ scoring steals the show?,9,8 April 2005,"I stumbled across 'Body Heat' recently during a late night channel surf, and I would have to say that I was also pleasantly surprised at the high quality of this movie.Though the acting and direction are top notch, I felt the music really pushed the movie over the top. The hauntingly melancholic string work serves not only as ambiance, but also acts as narrative. The sweet yet cautionary score mirrors the plot theme of 'moth to the flame'- obvious danger yet unavoidably seductive beauty. To this day, it sends chills down my spine!p.s. Ted Danson's 'happy go lucky, dancing fool' role is sublime. Reminds me of his 'Creepshow' role around this same time period, which is also great.",Body Heat
168,inprosys,"Excellent acting, script, and camera work -- just an excellent movie",10,26 July 2009,"--- Absolutely explicit spoiler information follows --- --- Do NOT proceed if you haven't seen this movie ---OK. Everyone has worked this excellent movie over with comments so there's no need to add much more -- except one question that I can't find answered anywhere: What was the ""exotic land"" that Matty was in at the end? One clue was the language that her companion used when he said ""It is hot."" Anyone pick up on what language that is?The chemistry between William Hurt and Kathleen Turner was wonderful -- even if you know in the end that she was faking it! Ted Danson, Mickey Rourke and Richard Crenna were each perfectly cast and did a wonderful job.When you look at this film today (2009), it is hard to believe that that was the same ""Mickey Rourke"" that appeared in the recent ""The Wrestler"" -- but, you could tell that he was going to be something special.",Body Heat
169,cynaj,Love this movie!,10,29 March 2018,"Watched this movie for the first time when it first came out on video. 35 years later, every time I hear a wind chime, especially on a hot, humid night, I get so turned on! If you've seen it, you'll understand.(A young Mickey Rourke, if you can picture it, was super sexy in his small role.)",Body Heat
