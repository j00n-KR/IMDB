0,TheLittleSongbird,Jigsaw is back!,7,30 November 2017,"Prior to watching 'Jigsaw', as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible during a much needed quiet period after five years of intensive, richly rewarding but at times stressful music college studying, the previous seven 'Saw' films were watched to know what to expect and having heard so much about the franchise.The franchise is somewhat variable in quality, the problematic but very well done first film being the best and the best sequels being the second and sixth. The third film didn't do much for me, the fourth film left me on the fence while the fifth and 'Saw 3D: The Final Chapter' were severe let downs. Will go out on a limb, and am not sure how controversial an opinion it is, saying that after seeing 'Jigsaw' that it is generally one of the series' best and perhaps the best since the first.'Jigsaw' is not perfect certainly and the problems here are apparent in the previous films too. The editing is sloppy. The characters are one-dimensional with incomplete character arcs. The story does have logic and credulity issues (like the rest of the 'Saw' films did, including the original), with a few strands not particularly well rounded off. The script, sometimes tight and intriguing while half-baked and cheesy in others, and the acting, with a chilling Tobin Bell and an assured Laura Vandervoort coming off very well and others being bland, are uneven.However, 'Jigsaw', editing aside, doesn't look too bad at all, to me it's one of the better-looking 'Saw' films and a far cry from the shoddiness of 'Saw 3D: The Final Chapter's' production values. It's claustrophobic, elaborate and very atmospheric, with a creepy production design and some of the series' most polished direction helping a lot. The music is suitably eerie.Despite its ridiculousness, the story is also edge-of-your-seat and highly atmospheric. There is genuine dread, some truly imaginative traps and kills and much of it throughout is disturbing and creepy. It's gruesome but not gratuitously or over-reliantly so. While structurally it's pretty much more of the same, there is enough freshness to stop 'Jigsaw' from feeling tired and like the series had run out of juice, a vibe that a few of the previous sequels gave off. The turns the film takes are clever if not exactly bold, and the spectacularly chilling ending is one of the series' best and most memorable, saying a lot seeing as most of the films do not have good endings (with the exceptions of the first, 'Saw VI' and this). Jigsaw himself still fascinates with enough of what sets him apart as a character.Overall, Jigsaw is back in one of the series' better outings. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Jigsaw
1,Leofwine_draca,Unnecessary but acceptable sequel,6,2 November 2017,"I agree that JIGSAW is an unnecessary sequel in the SAW franchise, but if I'm honest the whole series has been unnecessary, aside from the first movie. This one's a densely-plotted lukewarm rehash of previous sequels and ideas, with five characters engaging in more against-the-clock deadly traps while the detectives on the outside attempt to figure out whether the killer Jigsaw really is back and on the prowl again.As with the sequels, this is pretty confusing stuff although it all makes sense towards the end, although I wasn't all that convinced by some of the twists. An aged Tobin Bell returns to his role (thanks to one of the aforementioned twists) and is a welcome presence, and the traps are gruesome and nasty, although not the most inventive of the franchise. All together, this is acceptable fare, although not a film you'll want to bother revisiting.",Jigsaw
2,SnoopyStyle,only for the fanatics,5,22 February 2018,"Detective Halloran pursues criminal Edgar who is killed by the police. Police tech Logan Nelson connects with Eleanor, a fan of the Jigsaw contraptions. There are five people chained by the neck with buckets covering their heads forced to play Jigsaw's game. As each one is killed, the police finds a body matching the dead.The Jigsaw game is repetitive but it's still fun sometimes. Who doesn't cringe when somebody sticks their hand into danger? That's the joy of this franchise. The rest is unnecessary. The police investigation is completely flat and the connection boring. Anybody who has seen a Saw movie knows that first kill is suspicious. Aside from the flawed police section of the movie, the Jigsaw game has plenty of questionable actions. It's all questionable but it has some fun B-horror aspects for the midnight scream crowd.",Jigsaw
3,claudio_carvalho,Incredibly Bad Movie,3,12 January 2018,"The ""Jigsaw"" franchise had a reasonable beginning in 2004 and along the years, the downfall was easily predicable with terrible, incredible and worse and worse screenplays. In 2010, the franchise reached its bottom with the awful ""Saw 3D"". The franchise was resting in peace, but seven years later, the directors Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig decide to revive the infamous franchise with the writers Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg. The result is a shameful bad movie with the most absurd and incredibly twists and overrated in IMDb. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Jogos Mortais: Jigsaw"" (""Mortal Games: Jigsaw"")",Jigsaw
4,nogodnomasters,The Game. It's Started.,7,6 November 2017,"This is a continuation or rebirth of the ""SAW"" series. I had started watching a ""SAW"" marathon and turned it off in the middle of the third film. The continuity was gone and it had gotten repetitive and boring. In this film as bodies turn up, it is believed John Kramer is back from the dead killing people, but how? The film runs between the police investigation, and the puzzle scenes.The film has a nice little twist and the gore,torture, and blood was well spaced. The film had some good characters that needed better development.Guide: F-word. Brief corpse nudity. Severed body parts. Cool head split.",Jigsaw
5,kosmasp,Riddle me this,5,14 July 2018,"So a fresh start, with a throwback and still one major player from the whole franchise. But how you may ask? Are they mad? And wasn't it definitive what happend to Jigsaw in Part 3? And while this may be the one Saw that does not depend too much on you having seen (m)any of the previous entries into the franchise.And as was usual with the movies, you know the movie tries to trick you to believe in certain things, just to pull the rug from under you. Now that twist does not work for me and I think there are more holes in the story than in a swiss cheese. But there are also the usual traps and deaths and the suspense you go through with all the characters involved. So while it's not the best entry (imho), I reckon you can watch it - there are still stories to be told, the question is if there is still that much of an audience if you don't radically change certain things ...",Jigsaw
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"Style and substance, plenty of both.",8,22 August 2018,"The Saw/Jigsaw franchise has certainly lasted longer then many anticipated, it had seemed to have run its course, but of course money talks, and while people watch them, they'll continue to make them. With that in mind, my expectations were low to say the least, I expected very little, but isn't it always the way, you expect lots and get disappointed, and on occasion, you expect little, and get a cracking movie. Jigsaw is a wonderfully stylish film, which boasts a great story, clever and complex, and some unexpected moments of horror. This time round they've toned down the gore to some extent, and focused more on the complexities of the story, so this film boasts some definite substance, but also looks super stylish, it's a beautifully made film. The twist, was I expecting it, No, was it good, yes, reminiscent of previous movies I grant you, but enjoyable nonetheless.Will there be a follow up to this? You can bet your bottom dollar, let's just hope it's the standard of this one. 8/10",Jigsaw
7,jboothmillard,Jigsaw,7,7 November 2017,"Everyone assumed Saw: The Final Chapter was the last we'd seen of the ""torture porn"" / ""gorno"" franchise, featuring Billy the Puppet and the torture traps, but Halloween came along, and this eighth entry, directed by the Spierig Brothers (Daybreakers). Basically criminal Edgar Munsen (Josiah Black) is chased by police to a rooftop, despite warning he activates a triggering mechanism, he is shot and severely injured by police Detective Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie) and his fellow officers. Elsewhere, five people are being held captive in a run-down barn, each with mechanical helmets, and a metal noose around their neck leading to a wall of buzz saws. A tape recording of John Kramer, aka the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell), explains that to escape they must sacrifice blood, and confess their sins, the chains pull, four manage to survive, cutting themselves, but one man still unconscious is left behind and apparently dies. The next test reveals that captive Carly (Brittany Allen) accidentally caused the death of an asthmatic woman, following a handbag robbery. There are three syringes, one an antidote for the poison in her body, one a saline solution, one a potent acid, she must inject herself with one to save the others from being hanged, volatile group-member Ryan (Paul Braunstein) stabs with all three syringes, Carly's face melts and she dies. During the games, Halloran and his partner Detective Keith Hunt (Clé Bennett) investigate the deaths when the bodies are discovered, Halloran is suspicious of forensic pathologists Logan Nelson (Matt Passmore) and Eleanor Bonneville (Hannah Emily Anderson), Logan is a military veteran and former doctor, his wife was killed two years ago. Munsen is kidnapped from the hospital by an unseen assailant, the police rule out John Kramer as the killer, he has been dead for ten years, the police captain orders his body to be exhumed to be sure, Munsen's body is found in the coffin. In another room, Ryan tries to cheat and escape through a door marked ""No Exit"", his leg is trapped by razor wires beneath the floor, fellow group members Anna (Laura Vandervoort) and Mitch (Mandela Van Peebles, Mario's son) get trapped inside a grain silo. A taped message explains they will be buried in grain, and killed by falling debris, if Ryan does not pull a lever to free them, Ryan eventually agrees, pulling the lever severs his leg, Anna and Mitch are released. Mitch is tested next, a taped message reveals he sold a motorcycle with faulty brakes to a young man, revealed as John Kramer's nephew, resulting in his death, Anna tries to help, but Mitch is lowered into a spiral-shaped blade, and is shredded to death. Logan and Eleanor talk in a bar, then she takes him to her ""studio"", revealing herself as an obsessive fangirl of the Jigsaw Killer, with replicas of many of his previous traps, she worries this could incriminate her. Detective Hunt has followed them and informs Halloran, Logan convinces his old friend Hunt to not arrest them, mentioning Halloran's past dealings with Edgar Munsen, Eleanor deduces the location of the barn game, Halloran pursues her and Logan. Anna tries to cheat and escape, she is captured by someone in a pig mask, she awakens with a gravely wounded Ryan, both are chained in a room, the hooded figure is revealed to be John Kramer. He reveals he was Anna's neighbour, and that she suffocated her baby in a fit of rage, but blamed her husband, planting the body next to his, making it appear he accidentally smothered the child, her husband committed suicide because of this. John explains that Anna and Ryan have not yet earned their survival, he places a loaded gun inbetween them, saying it is their ""key"" to their survival, Anna misinterprets this and tries to shoot Ryan, but the gun is rigged, it backfires and kills her, Ryan sobs, realising the key was in the gun chamber, it is now destroyed. Logan and Eleanor investigate the barn, Halloran ambushes them, Eleanor escapes, Halloran pursues her, but is drugged and taken by an unseen assailant, he and Logan wake up chained, wearing collars rigged with laser cutters. The two are told that they must confess all of their sins or else they will die, Halloran forces Logan to go first, Logan confesses he made the mistake of mixing John Kramer's x-rays, causing his cancer to be diagnosed when it was too late, despite confessing, the lasers appear to kill Logan. Halloran confesses and admits allowing many criminals and murderers to walk free for personal gain, the lasers deactivate, then suddenly Logan stands up, he faked his death to make Halloran confess. Logan reveals that the barn game took place ten years ago, he was the man unconscious, John Kramer saved him, feeling he should not die out of error, John subsequently made Logan his apprentice. The bodies found were actually criminals that Halloran allowed to walk free, and were placed in the same tests he was supposed face ten years prior, Logan also reveals that Munsen, one of the criminals allowed free, murdered his wife. But Halloran did not confess all of his sins, and broke the rules, he will die and be framed as the new Jigsaw Killer, the lasers are reactivated, Logan slams the door as Halloran's head is sliced apart. Also starring Edward Ruttle as Matt Michael Boisvert as Lee James, Sam Koules as Melissa, Troy Feldman as Officer Palermo and Shaquan Lewis as Officer Solomon. When I read Tobin Bell was in the cast, I questioned if he was back from the dead, this thought continued all the way through the film, you do have to concentrate a little harder, but the formula has not changed too much, the traps are just as vicious, the amount of blood spill and over the top deaths are nasty, and the story just about comes together for the twist conclusion, a welcome return and a worthwhile horror. Very good!",Jigsaw

9,BA_Harrison,Let the games begin. Again.,6,23 August 2018,"In Jigsaw, a group of victims in a remote warehouse find themselves subjected to a series of deadly games involving rotary saw blades, a giant mincer, lethal syringes, cheese wire, and numerous falling objects with lots of sharp pointy bits. It seems as though John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is up to his old tricks again, but how can that be when the ingenious killer has been dead and buried for over ten years? Detective Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie) is on the case, but even he isn't above suspicion.I think I am in the minority saying this, but I found chapters 5 through 7 to be the most enjoyable of the Saw sequels thanks to their outrageously complex (and unlikely) contraptions of torture and death, so this return to basics, with its simpler traps, was bound to be a bit of a disappointment. There's quite a bit of gore, with severed limbs and revoltingly realistic mutilated corpses, and a neat twist at the end in which all of the pieces of the puzzle finally fall into place, but the film does very little new with the concept - it's merely a serviceable reboot intended to milk more money from the Saw cash cow.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Jigsaw
10,BandSAboutMovies,Ugh,2,5 September 2020,"The Spierig Brothers directed Winchester, a movie I really didn't enjoy and now here they are to make the eighth film in a series that I really don't enjoy. Man, I apologize for sounding so negative right off the bat. I've just watched every Saw movie in 24 hours amidst a global pandemic and the growing fascism of the country I love, so you'll have to excuse me.This movie takes place ten years after the death of John Kramer. It was written by Josh Stolberg (Piranha 3D, Sorority Row) and Peter Goldfinger, who had been trying to get their new version of Saw made for years.This made $103 million on a $10 million investment, so obviously there was a desire for fans to get to see a new installment. It will lead to another sequel, Spiral, which will have Chris Rock and Samuel Jackson in it, which is way more star power than these movies have had for some time. A tenth film in the series is also on the way.I do have to say for as much as I don't really enjoy these movies, I do love that they do a blood drive with the release of each film. That's a pretty cool thing and they've made some nice keepsakes for fans of this series, like posters with Tobin Bell's blood.I did it! I made it through every Saw film - for now - and I still have all my limbs and my head is still attached! Wait! What's that puppet doing? Who are these pig people? OH NO! THEY'RE MAKING ME WATCH THEM AGAIN!",Jigsaw
11,Coventry,"Saw it, already",4,20 March 2020,"With the exception of James Wan's 2003 original, I didn't really like any of the ""Saw"" movies, but almost as a matter of course, I faithfully watched all the sequels when they got released. ""Saw"" is pretty much like the ""Police Academy"" series... You know from beforehand they are hardly worth your time, but watch them anyways. Clever Hollywood marketeers must have noticed this behavioral trend among many horror fanatics, and thus a revival of the franchise was bound to happen sooner or later; - even seven years after the release of the supposedly final instalment and the irreversible death of protagonist John Kramer.Despite all the fuzz and the recruitment of an acclaimed directors' duo (Michael & Peter Spierig of ""Undead"" and ""Daybreakers""), the renewed ""Jigsaw"" is an astoundingly mundane and unsurprising effort. The old formula always remained tremendously successful, so they simply decided not to change anything. It's still a standard ""Torture Porn"" effort with ingenious but incredibly far-fetched and often absurd death traps, insufferable self-centered and obnoxious characters (you actually can't wait for them to die) and the occasional creepy (but derivative) moments provided by the nasty clown doll on its tricycle. There's plenty of gore to enjoy, caused by eerie tools like rotary saws and industrial mincers, and I have to give the writers at least some credit for their creativity regarding the end-twist. On the other hand, it's been three days since I watched ""Jigsaw"", and I'm already having a hard time remembering most of it.",Jigsaw
12,michaelRokeefe,How can it be? Must be a copycat killer,5,16 September 2018,"How often has a very popular series of movies left and made it back with any success? Let's trot out, what the eight installment of SAW? Bodies are being scattered around with no immediate hint of origin. Investigators not wanting to look foolish actually think clues may point straight to John Kramer, the man once called Jigsaw. The problem is that he has been deceased for more than a decade. Fans get what they want; grotesque mutilation of bodies without a doubt in horrible ways. Not the absolute best, nor the worst either. But it is sad to have to spend time at the end of a movie to explain the motivation. Appearing briefly is Tobin Bell as Jigsaw/John Kramer and rounding out the cast: Matt Passmore, Hannah Emily Anderson, Josiah Black, Laura Vandervoort, Callum Keith Rennie, Brittany Allen and Mandela Van Peebles.",Jigsaw
13,neil-476,Not vastly surprising,7,8 May 2018,"10 years after Jigsaw killer John Kramer died, a series of killings seems to indicate that he's back. But how can he be? I saw him die! I saw him buried! I saw... hmm, saw....The Saw franchise of horror movies gave us Jigsaw's twisted modus operandi - kidnap a number of people who have wronged others and got away with it, then put them into a series of ""games"" wherein they are given a choice between bloodily maiming, and thereby redeeming, themselves, or facing an inventive but gory demise. Needless to say, multiple deaths ensue.Jigsaw, 7 years after the last Saw film but, chronologically, 10 years after the events in it, delivers more of the same, and features Tobin Bell returning as the dead - or so we thought - Jigsaw/John Cramer. This gives you what you expect from a Saw film - complicated and bloody slaughter, but it is also well-plotted with explanatory reveals which are satisfying but which don't cheat you if you have watched the series so far.This is very much of its sort and, by that criterion, it's quite good.",Jigsaw
14,trashgang,nice follow up in the franchise,7,9 November 2017,"I thought, well, jigsaw is death what are they going to do with him and with the franchise. Is it going to be another entry or a sequel. After seeing it I had a good feeling about it, simply because it's a mixture of then and now and there's not that much of a story going on, it's all about the traps.If you are into the franchise then it's a must see that deliver on all sides. I mean, you will come across jigsaw, you will have your torture porn but you will surely have your gory moments. Question I had a lot was, I didn't saw the earlier entries will I be able to follow the story. No probs. Throughout the flick everything is explained about him so don't worry, newcomers can pick it up too.You won't go to see it for a the acting because it's not all that Oscar winning style but you go to those kind of movies pure for the horror. On that fact, effects are really well done and they don't hide the gore. The theater was half full when I saw it and the first gory moment some were laughing but most off them were offended by the scene, so gore-hounds, it's out there for you.The twist at the end, that I didn't see coming, makes it of course open to make part 9, will it?

Direct to video movie quality: Campy script in a bad way. Plot holes, poor character hooks, bad character arches, awful movie gimmicks. Started out as a detective movie but deteriorate in many silly sub plots, and plot twists. The character's where flat aka: the evil cop, the predictable side kick cop, and the usual plot twist characters at the end.

16,Hellmant,For me the film is pretty disappointing.,6,3 November 2017,"'JIGSAW': Three Stars (Out of Five)The eighth installment in the popular slasher flick franchise, which is released seven years after the seventh chapter (which was said to be the last installment). It takes place ten years after the death of the Jigsaw killer, when a new series of brutal murders appear to be the work of the same deceased madman. It was directed by Michael and Peter Spierig (who also helmed the horror movies 'DAYBREAKERS' and 'UNDEAD'), and it was written by Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger (the duo also co-wrote the slasher flicks 'PIRANHA 3D' and 'SORORITY ROW'). The film stars Matt Passmore, Callum Keith Rennie, Cle Bennett, Hannah Emily Anderson and Tobin Bell reprising the title role. I was a big fan of the first three movies in the franchise, but I was less impressed with the later sequels, and I'm even less impressed with this new one. When new victims of a twisted game begin showing up dead, it appears that the deceased serial killer John Kramer, also known as Jigsaw (Bell), is responsible. Detectives Halloran (Rennie) and Hunt (Bennett) must find out who's really responsible, but all of the evidence keeps pointing to Jigsaw though. A doctor, named Logan Nelson (Passmore), becomes Halloran's prime suspect, but he maintains he's being framed. The whole time new captives desperately try to survive Jigsaw's psychotic game.The movie is full of brutal violence, and complicated plot twists (like the other 'SAW' films), but none of it seems fresh or clever anymore. The whole movie just seems like something we've already seen many times before, and I really wanted to see a lot more of Jigsaw in it too. For me the film is pretty disappointing, because I was a big fan of the first three movies and I was really hoping this new installment could recapture some of that same feel. It actually turns out to be one of the weaker horror films released this year (which has been a great year for horror actually), and I really wish I didn't have to say that too. Fans of the series will probably be disappointed, if they're anything like me that is, at least.",Jigsaw
17,thesar-2,Saw It All Before,2,27 October 2017,"Wait. Was this PG-13? It sure felt like it was and Expendable.The most positive thing I could say about Part Eight of the Saw franchise is that the crew knew what made the latter part of the series' memorable: flashbacks, twists, bad acting and terrible dialogue.Maybe it was a hindrance that I decided to spend the entire 7 days prior to Jigsaw's release watching one Saw movie a day. Maybe I was sawed out.In a series that I originally thought got progressively worse, I found a little comfort in how closely tied the first seven were. It did feel like one long (approx.) 11-hour miniseries and, yeah, that did make the series feel complete. And when it was over, it needed to be over. I was glad it was over.Speaking of over, this is absolute overkill, only less on the killing. It was so mild, so held-back, my original positive turns into a negative whereas the creators forgot how much blood there should be.Basically, it's 10 years later and immediately as the movie opens, the game begins again. As in Saw-lore, the movie shifts from the cop side to a Jigsaw game. Will there be twists? Sure, but you predict them from the start. Will there be red herrings? Of course, but like the twists, you'll know who's behind this. Will there be redemption? Well, not for the series.The games played were enormously lame, the tired setups seem ancient and the gore factor was so dialed back, I thought I was watching the most gruesome scenes from the ""vampire"" movie, Twilight. Extremely minor things were updated (new technology – sort of – from the last outings,) but barely anything was new or brought in to refresh the series. Well, except laughs.Some of the traps were so hilariously bad, I seriously couldn't figure out if that was intentional or not. Perhaps they were meant as jokes to poke fun at their own series as the characters did constantly mock the designs as well. (If this was the case, then I will give them credit for that.)This movie did have potential, but it felt like it was written as quickly as the previously 1-per-year scripts. Only, this time they had 7 years to come up with something! They just blew it with a rehash of one of the worst in the original seven.I wouldn't recommend seeing Saw: Legacy, er, I mean, Saw VIII, um, Jigsaw!***Final thoughts: After my Sawathon, here's how they rank:1. Saw (★★★★/5 Stars.)2. Saw II (★★★★/5 Stars.)3. Saw III (★★★½/5 Stars.)4. Saw VI (★★★/5 Stars.)5. Saw IV (★★★/5 Stars.)6. Saw V (★★½/5 Stars.)7. Saw 3D (★★/5 Stars.)8. Jigsaw (★½/5 Stars.)",Jigsaw
18,FeastMode,big step down,5,24 July 2019,"Meh. It was ok. At least it wasn't garbage. But the other movies are significantly awesomer. Fairly predictable and the traps were underwhelmingi had a pretty good time on second viewing with lowered expectations. I thought about changing it to a 6 but there are too many stupid parts and things that don't make sense. That being said, i'd be curious to see a continuation of this story and will probably watch this again when i revisit the series. (2 viewings, 5/13/2021)",Jigsaw
19,CuriosityKilledShawn,Put it together in your own time,6,4 November 2017,"Saw has had many ups and downs as a series. The ""final chapter"" in 2010 was about as limp as soggy bread, giving us nothing shocking and a long-expected twist.Jigsaw begins anew (don't expect Hoffman or Dr. Gordon to return) and features new characters and a new set of games. But...how can this be if John Kramer died over ten years ago? Is he really dead? He has to be. Right?There are definite improvements here. The cinematography and production design is light years beyond the previous movies. I used to refer to Saw having ""faketography"" with some of the rudest, ugliest, and cheapest filters and color corrections ever to dirty the big screen. Jigsaw, being the first to be shot in 2.35:1, actually looks cinematic and it's the film's best feature. The games and traps themselves are gruesome but not overplayed, which took the focus away from torture porn and gave it a bit more of the psychological edge we got in the first movie.Sadly, it fails elsewhere. The story gives us YET MORE cops, YET MORE coroners, and YET MORE doctors (all of them forgettable) filling up the side story. Sorry, but after a seven-year hiatus this should have been more unique and subversive. I gotta admit though, that twist ending had me kicking myself, and Charlie Clouser's score is as intense as ever.Not a bad film, but not the huge comeback it should have been.

21,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,22 January 2018,"JigsawThe worst thing about taking hostages is that Stockholm syndrome obligates you to send them all Christmas cards.Even the killer in this horror movie has empathized with his victims over the years.The deceased Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back in action, welcoming new captors (Laura Vandervoort, Brittany Allen, Mandela Van Peebles) to his complex torture tests designed to draw confessions of past sins from each.As the hostages struggle for survival in captivity, dead bodies begin appearing around the city leading detective Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie) to suspect that a copycat killer is responsible.Borrowing heavily from previous installments for its two major plot twists, this eighth chapter of the floundering franchise is predictable to anyone with a passing familiarity with the series. While Jigsaw's traps are inventive, the largely Canadian cast is hammy. And remember the ransom for a Canadian hostage is half due to the exchange rate. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Jigsaw

Honestly, I had no big expectations and I had no intentions to see it on big screen, but I did it only because my FB movie group chose it for our first real life gathering. And it was exactly what I expected it to be. Decent addition to cult franchise without bigger flaws, but nothing more than decent. It has nice pace and atmosphere, good acting and satisfying story. Twists did not shock me, but I didn't predict them either. But this time traps were the weakest link. Some being completely unoriginal, just variations of traps already used in previous movies, some new but totally unimaginative.

23,Platypuschow,Jigsaw: An improvement but still highly meh!,6,4 May 2018,"Despite the last SAW movie being called ""The Final Chapter"" 2017 brought us yet another addition to the franchise and it's a real mixed bag.I think the SAW series started off very well, they showed real promise were clever well constructed movies but alas alike so many other horror franchises it got milked into mediocrity.The movies gradually got worse and worse and they felt desperate, blatant cash ins and it was such a shame that such a franchise had become tarnished. These things need to know when to call it a day and SAW didn't.So here we have another game, another spate of killings in gruesome fashion but this time it looks like Jigsaw is really back from the grave! Sprinkled with good ideas Jigsaw is certainly an improvement on other recent efforts and delivers a few twists along the way. It doesn't however come close to the dizzying heights of the first few films.I'd advise fans of the franchise give this a go but truly believe that this should be the last. Let SAW die before it becomes another franchise whose credibility is gone because it's creators didn't know when to stop.The Good:Passable twistTobin BellThe Bad:Still not coming close to its originsEssentially more of the sameThings I Learnt From This Movie:I still love Jigsaws style and struggle to see him as an antagonist",Jigsaw

25,cruise01,Jigsaw is back. Interesting twist and turns but less gory than the others which is shocking.,6,29 October 2017,"Jigsaw is back for an eighth film after several years from the conclusion of a terrible supposedly final chapter saw movie. Jigsaw is an okay film, its not terrible neither good. With directors The Spierig Brothers direction and a new set of writers trying to bring back the Jigsaw killer. There was a way of continuing on with the franchise either with a new twists that tries to bring back the torture porn of death traps and either a new killer or perhaps Jigsaw's legacy was not over. I enjoyed the first few Saw films from the bloody gory death traps, the connection on how every victim has with each other, and the twists that is played with Charlie Clouser's music theme in the final minute of the movies. As every film goes on, it just feels like they straying away from the plots connection and having new victims that has no connections and more bloody traps. Jigsaw film however, does not feel like a Saw movie. The plot feels more like a police procedural drama, were Det. Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie) is following up a case were bodies are discovered. And same with the video tapes of Jigsaw's voice (Tobin Bell). Is the Jigsaw really dead? Or is there a new Jigsaw copycat that is taking over his games? Halloran is trying to follow a lead that has several people playing the game in a hidden barn. Were they are fighting for their lives of going through several death traps, as they are suppose to solve the clues to why they are there. With the help from forensic pathologist Logan and Eleanor (Matt Passmore and Hannah Emily Anderson). They are trying to solve their own mystery when traces of evidence is leading back to Jigsaw being alive and the connections every victim has with each other. The plot played like a TV police procedural drama which took away from the Saw movies feel. It was fun to see Halloran trying to solve the mystery with the victims and Jigsaw. And than the movie flashes back to the victims in the barn, who are forced to play a game that will end bloody. The death traps and the bloody sequences are quick and less gory than the previous seven films. And the traps are also quite forgettable this time. Sure, for the audience that can not handle blood and gore will still find this disturbing. There are also a couple of unpredictable twists that works with the film and is what leaves you talking about it. Definitely not as great as the first film. The cast was also decent. Matt Passmore is a fun new addition. Callum Keith Rennie was okay. And the cast of victims that were forced in death traps are not easily memorable. Like all horror films, the first couple are usually the best and the rest are just repeats with less of a plot. And this film does not add or bring anything new to the direction of the franchise. Overall, Jigsaw is a fair horror film. The twists works well. The thrills is decent with the victims being forced to injure themselves to survive. The plot does not feel like the Saw movies. And the death traps are forgettable.I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars. I ll recommend it if you want to watch a bloody torture porn film or if your into that. Otherwise, I ll suggest it as a rental.",Jigsaw
26,leonblackwood,"Watchable, but nothing amazing!",3,5 March 2018,"Review:
After watching the first few Saw movies, the franchise become a bit ""same ol' same ol"", so I decided to give the rest of the movies a miss. I think everyone was shocked to see another movie about John Kramer (Tobin Bell), who died 10 years before, so I was curious to see what direction the plot was going to take. Right from the beginning, it just felt like another Saw movie, with the gruesome and mind bending games, which test the minds of the victims who have to make difficult choices. With the bodies turning up around the city, Detective Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie) and Detective Keith Hunt (Cle Bennett) work closely with the forensic team, Logan Nelson (Matt Passmore) and Eleanor Bonneville (Hannah Emily Anderson), to try and find the culprit who is murdering people, in the most gruesome ways. All of the clues lead to John Kramer, whose supposed to be dead for 10 years, and the trust between the cops and the forensic team starts to run thin. With time against them, and more cryptic messages from the murderer, the investigators split up to try and save the surviving victims but can they get to them on time! Some of the horrific scenes did go a bit far, like the laser scene towards the end but apart from that, it just seemed like a typical Saw movie to me. The acting wasn't that great, and the plot has been done to death but I'm sure the true fans of this genre, which I'm not, will enjoy it. Average!Round-Up:
Although I wasn't a big fan of this movie, this franchise has got a big following, hence the profit at the box office, so I think that a lot of people was happy to see the Tobin Bell legacy back on the big screen. The movie was directed by Michael & Peter Spierig, who also brought you Daybreakers and Predestination, which both had Ethan Hawke in the leading role. They done a decent job, in terms of staying true to the original Saw movies but they didn't bring anything fresh to the table. The intensity throughout the movie was quite good, and the various clues do make you think ""whodunnit"" but once the culprit is revealed, it ended quite abruptly. Anyway, it's worth a watch but it isn't anything amazing.Budget: $10million

27,TheMovieDiorama,Jigsaw tries to justify rebooting the thoroughly milked Saw franchise.,3,26 February 2018,"Guess what? It's boring. This feels like 'Saw 27', I'm so fed up of horror franchises being constantly milked to death for money. At the time of this review, I've only seen the first and fourth chapters. Liked the first, disliked the fourth. Yet, here we are again. Another five seemingly random strangers must undergo a variety of tricky traps set by a copycat Jigsaw killer. Simultaneously, detectives try to find out who the copycat is or if the real John Kramer is still alive. Who even cares? Like seriously this was a waste of my time. I left the cinema having pretty much forgotten everything besides the plot twist and one trap. The plot twist, that everyone has been raving about, admittedly is meticulously thought out and well executed. Perhaps too much explanation during the reveal but it did wake me up. So that's a bonus. There was one trap that was extremely creative that involves a machine with a sharp spinning spiral. The other traps were far too tame and unfortunately boring to watch. The story is so formulaic and structured that this doesn't feel like a continuation or a reboot, it's just depressingly dull. The characters were, once again, uninteresting. Repent, confess, admit...flip, I don't care. Just die and be done with it already. They tried to incorporate back stories for each victim but with less personality than a washed up flailing fish...I literally couldn't care. For any of them. Pretty much two narratives here. We have 'Saw 27' with traps galore and then we have an episode of CSI or Hawaii Five-O where our detectives try to crack the case. The plot twist then blends the two together. That's great and all, but when both narratives are lifeless and use two opposing paces it just leaves a bitter aftertaste of inconsistency. Safe to say, I didn't like this. It's just the same old usual stuff for the hundredth time. It's not clever. It's a crime. Can we just kill this franchise now please? Pretty please?",Jigsaw

It looked like they are trying to turn Jigsaw into something a little different than the Saw series. While all the elements seemed in play out well, it feels like they slightly changed the genre to lean more towards suspense than horror. Thought it was a good idea. Overall, their attempts are not as cool as the first round of films.

30,jtindahouse,They've still got it!,9,4 November 2017,"Even though people rarely admit it, the 'Saw' series has been one of the highest quality horror series ever made. 'Jigsaw' is the eighth entry in the series and there is still yet to be a bad film made amongst them. Some are undoubtedly better than others, but I defy you to point me out one that is inherently bad. I also defy you to show me another horror series (even any type of series at all is rare) that has maintained quality across that many films. That's why I was so happy that 'Jigsaw' was a brilliant movie, because if they had come back seven years later only to put forward a bad film for the sake of making money it would have ruined everything. Luckily that was not the case though.While this one does follow the formula used in all the past films, it also feels quite unique in a number of ways. The original seven films were all set within a very tight time-frame. This one of course is pushing ten years into the future. This adds layers of intrigue to the proceedings, because how could 'Jigsaw' be committing these crimes when he died all those years back? And you just know they're going to have a brilliant answer to that question.As far as the traps go in this one, I'm not too sure how I feel. None of them were bad, however none of them really blew me away either. My favourite one (without giving away any spoilers) was actually the most simple one in the film involving a gun. The psychology behind that one is what I loved. I love when these films aren't afraid to be intelligent.The twist in this one also caught me completely off-guard. I've heard people say they weren't entirely convinced by it and felt that the film cheated, however I disagree. Nothing is off limits coming in a 'Saw' movie. You have to know that going in. Altogether I absolutely loved this film and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is in anyway interested in the genre.",Jigsaw
31,Stevieboy666,Mixed feelings,5,25 July 2018,"Saw was inventive,original and gory, great movie. Part 2 was a fine follow up. But then the series steadily went down hill, with ever increasingly stupid, unbelievable plots to keep the franchise rolling. And so 10 years after the death of John Kramer (always played well by Tobin Bell) the Jigsaw murders begin again. 
I enjoyed this film visually, it's pretty slick and it's running time never drags. There's the usual inventive torture/death scenes and some good gore (in particular the corpses at the morgue), though it's not as nasty as some of the previous episodes. Acting and production values are all fine.
But what I don't like about this - and the previous 3 or 4 sequels - is the silly, unbelievable plot that that justifies keeping this franchise running. Obviously it's all about making money at the end of the day, but the saying ""flogging a dead horse"" springs to mind.

This is the 8th movie in the 'Saw' franchise and yes, I know, the last one back in 2010 was called the final chapter but he's back-you just can't keep a good man down. This is the first Saw movie that has the character's name, Jigsaw, in the title. What is remarkable to me is that Jigsaw/Tobin was killed off in the third Saw movie but the producers keep coming up with ways for him to make an appearance-and yes, they have an explanation here, too. This one starts with bodies turning up dead and all the evidence points to one man as being responsible, Tobin. Callum is the lucky policeman that gets to try and match wits with Tobin. Matt plays the medical examiner that gets to autopsy all the dead bodies showing up-and some of them are in pretty bad shape. Laura is one of the lucky contestants that gets to play Tobin's games, and yes, they are just as gruesome as always.

Saw & Saw 2 are great films, the first Saw is definitely a Horror Classic by now but after the really awesome part 2 i saw bits of the other films but didn't like the way over the top quality of them & turned them off when i tried watching a couple (4 & 5 i think?) on Netflix but the flicks was just over the top gross with annoying characters & just bad films to be honest but then i read some reviews on the simple titled JIGSAW & gave it try & was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.
First off ""Jigsaw"" is a revenge/Serial killer Thriller more than a Slasher Horror, the stuff that happens to the characters here all deserve it really & the Jigsaw killer that has now become a legend & Icon is really a smart vigilante dishing out true Justice!!!
I loved all the sick traps & evil stuff these villains go through, it's very smart & well thought out & very creative. The look of the film has a slick look with it's cop station/autopsy sequences & a gritty look for the other areas the film takes place. Each character has committed evil crimes & each will suffer. I loved the Vigilante style story & i loved the Cop Thriller approach to it all.
Jigsaw has more in common with films like, The Punisher, this is a revenge/vigilante Thriller & i wish this would really happen to all the evil sick pieces of sh#t out there that get away with everything because of the corrupted system!!! All pedos & evil scum should be hunted down & captured & put through these JIGSAW GAMES!!!

39,kluseba,Weakest entry in the franchise so far,5,5 July 2020,"Jigsaw is the reboot and eight entry in the franchise after a seven-year break. While the grisly atmosphere is still present and some of the traps are intriguing, this is easily the worst movie of the franchise due to a poor story and weak characters. This film is only recommended to die-hard fans of the franchise. The story revolves around five strangers facing a series of traps in an abandoned farm while the local police tries to figure out who might be behind those events since the murderous mastermind behind similar crimes died ten years earlier.On the positive side, the dynamic opening sequence grabs the viewers right from the start. The location of an abandoned farm offers some fresh new ideas. The trap in the silo is the highlight of the film.On the negative side, the characters are particularly shallow. None of the victims has any charisma and they are all absolutely exchangeable. The investigating detective who is randomly blaming people around him to collaborate with the Jigsaw killer is ridiculously stereotypical and perhaps the worst character ever involved in the franchise. The lazy twist at the end of the movie is weak and will leave audiences emotionless.If you are a fan of the franchise and find this movie for a few bucks, you can purchase it to complete your collection. However, this film is neither worth to be watched at your local cinema nor to be bought at full price. This average psychological thriller is by far the weakest entry in the franchise and the next movie Spiral needs to do a lot better to redeem it.

Detective Halloran has the job of tracking down the killer with the aid of two pathologists. One of these doctors has a rather outré hobby which causes her to be suspected of being the unsub.While the search for the killer ensues, five victims are trapped in a building and subjected to a series of tests/games by Jigsaw. Cut up by saws, hanged from a ceiling, injected with acid, so many ways to due. Or even to lose a limb when your leg is trapped by piano wires. This film is not for the squeamish or fainthearted, you even get a head cut into segments and a body shredded by spiral saws.There are enough surprises, shocks and red herrings to maintain the tension in this eighth installment of the Saw franchise but there are also clues which may help you to work out what's really going on. 7/10.",Jigsaw
41,aidanratesmovies,"Well, I Liked It",7,30 April 2021,"Although its potential shines brighter than what it became, and it certainly has its clunkier moments, Jigsaw manages to shine among the Saw sequels with its ambitious approach and purely entertaining storyline. I know this film certainly has a lot of haters, and I can understand their dislike for the film to a certain level. Its ambitious, and at times feels like if just a little more effort was made, it could have been great, which is certainly disappointing. However, I appreciate Jigsaw immensely for its cleverness and well crafted storyline. It's a very entertaining film, unlike 4-6 you won't feel moments of boredom throughout. Some traps can be a bit basic, but others are incredibly well done, perhaps some of the best in the franchise in general. It's full of so many twists and turns and works on so many levels it's hard to believe that they pulled it off at least somewhat at all. The cinematography is excellent, very different from the grotesque look and atmosphere of the other films, providing a much needed and refreshing point of view. Tobin Bell's performance is excellent, with Matt Passmore and Hannah Emily Anderson providing some excellent leading performances as well.

Lies that you have told yourselves, lies that have brutalized others.
Confess.
The truth will set you free.""When watching a YouTube video where a baseball hits someone with a dizzying speed right in the spot that's used to take care of having an offspring, I sometimes unwittingly make an ouch-sound and wince. That's what I had when watching the first ""Saw"" films. Not with this new episode from the ""Saw"" saga. The original film is phenomenal and without a doubt the best thing to see in the field of torture films. Both physically and psychologically. Perhaps the fact that this pioneering horror was directed by star director James Wan helped a bit. A nervous and exciting storyline with extreme forms of physical violence. Each time, the victims are driven to set their pain bar a bit higher, so they can regain their freedom.To be honest, I only saw the first three movies of this sinister serie. Not because my stomach couldn't stand it anymore, but because it was repetitive and something was missing. The cleverly made story was gradually pushed to the background and replaced by gore-looking killings. The more disgusting and sadistic, the better. Regardless whether the story makes sense or not. I really didn't feel like watching a modern ""De Sade"" story. To my surprise, I found out they've made already seven episodes from ""Saw"". About time to see, after so many years, if this comeback is worth a watch or not.The first thing I noticed was the softness of the film. Okay, you'll see some bloody fragments (a half sawn off head for instance), but eventually it all looks pretty civilized. In the first ""Saw"" films, the torture practices of not so innocent victims, were portrayed fairly explicitly and sometimes very distasteful (just think of the fragment with the ""Pig vat"" trap). In ""JigSaw"" the shock effect isn't the most important aspect. Here it's the created myth about the person John Kramer. Whether he's dead or not.Actually, I didn't care whether the legendary John Kramer resurrected from the grave or not. But despite the feeling that it was yet another way of exploiting a successful franchise and simply a recycling of the same groundbreaking concept without pushing any boundaries, it wasn't so bad afterall. ""Saw"" was inventive on a creative level. But on the other hand, if you've seen one, you've seen them all. The only thing you are looking forward to while watching this movie, are the ultra-violent and bloody murders tht are preceded by a terrible dilemma for the victims. Torment themselves or face a terrible death. ""Jigsaw"" is worth a watch. But I think I'll skip any future sequel. At a certain moment, it'll just become more boring and more uninspiring.",Jigsaw

When I watched the trailer for Jigsaw I was kind of excited for the return of our resident engineering maniac John Kramer but because it's has been seven years since the last Saw movie I had forgotten my thoughts at the end of the last film and that was why make more ? Having seen this, those are still my thoughts.This is the 8th film of the Saw franchise and sadistic serial killer Jigsaw is back to his old tricks, despite his apparent death a decade earlier. As his new victims fight to survive his twisted games, the police must solve Jigsaw's strange clues and deal with the improbability of his return . There have been eight Harry Potter movies and there are eight Saw movies and I've seen none of the former and all of the latter. That says more about me than anything else. 
This is not the worst of the Saw films but that's damning it with faint praise. There is absolutely nothing new to see here which might please ardent fans but I struggled with it at times. It's only ninety minutes long yet it still felt too long.

44,rgkarim,"""Let's Play A Game"" Again! Jigsaw Pieces Story Instead Of Gore",8,26 October 2017,"""Let's Play A Game"", those simple words haunted the theaters for years, signaling the start of yet another slasher movie in the Saw series. What started out as a unique twist to the serial killer saga was only the start to a face cringing, spine tingling, sometimes nauseating saga that hooked people in until around the sixth-seventh iteration when it finally ended. That was until this year, where the saga was to be reanimated in hopes of bringing more bucks to the theaters. Will this eighth installment have the ability to defy death like it's protagonist antihero, or is it dead like the poor victims of his games. Only one way to find out and that is read my friends, so let's get started!LIKES:Fast-Pace: With all the slow movies I have been seeing, I give props to the Saw series maintaining their consistent pace. From start to finish, the tale keeps moving, sparing no second for unnecessary details or attempts at prolonged character development. The mystery of figuring out the identity of the game master, mixed with the spread-out trials that promise a messy end are well-balanced to keep things going. Decent Characters: A horror movie often has many brain-dead characters begging to be chainsaw fodder. Fortunately, Saw movies continue to choose players who have a little more complexity and skills than many of the Spring Break teens favored. The tradition lives on, as each player has a little more buried within, still having a few obviously destined corpses, but others who have a shot at making it out. And for those not in the game, but trying to solve the mystery, they too have some layers to them that may or may not be pertinent to the story. It's those engaging elements that are crafted in the story, making them more engaging to follow. The Presentation: Another component I still like is the presentation of the movie. Many go for the kills, but the better component for me is how they separate the story into two settings. One is still the players trying to escape the closes thing to hell's torture chamber, while the other are the outside characters hunting down the ""maniac"" that continues to weave his traps. The ability to entangle these two components, balancing their timing to provide clues and hints to the story all while keeping you invested in the game. Such a dynamic presentation provides those checks and balances necessary for a slasher movie, and keeping things as fresh as possible. Twist: As many of you know, Saw movies are all about the ability to throw that last wrench into the gears to blow your mind. Despite my experience with predicting endings, this one got me. The questions I asked were on the right path, but they were able to drop enough interfering factors to throw me off the trail. Jigsaw once again impresses me with their storytelling, and their mastery of presentation. I can't say much more, but ask the right questions and you might get the answers. DISLIKES:Lazy Deaths: Those first few movies were convoluted in their traps. They had designed devices that were an impressive display of imagination, horror, and engineering that gave everyone a kick in terms of design. While Jigsaw still has the impressive connections and storytelling, it unfortunately fails in the terms of the traps themselves. They are surprisingly simple for the most part, and a little more reserved than I expected in this modern era. Yes, there is still plenty of blood in this battle for moral consequences, but they didn't involve quite as much skin crawling madness. Acting a little cheesy: Despite the engaging characters, there are times when there are a few inconsistencies in the character's intelligence, or often the case their acting. While decent for the most part, the writers hit some blocks in terms of dialogue or direction they wanted the characters to go. There are those moments the ""tension"" overwhelms them into hysterical messes that are cheesy rather than believable. In addition, the dialogue sometimes gets lazy, just going into expletives than conducive dialog. A weak dislike yes, but I'm drawing on straws. The potential for a series: Like the original series, I had hoped for an ending, but then this movie showed up. While I did enjoy it, I am worried that the way this movie ends sets up the potential for a new series to start. Sure, this means more Saw goodness, but it also means the potential to dilute this movie into another run of the mill series that will become a product of lazy producing. Hopefully that won't happen, but these days series are the prize most companies seek. The VERDICT:Jigsaw is the piece of the puzzle that brings quality back to the lovely massacre series. Going back to the roots, the writers were able to bring back a brilliant presentation and characters you can follow. All the nostalgic qualities rush in with the deadly traps, bringing that fast-pace, twisting tale that captivated us all those years ago. While still not the first movie, especially in terms of death design and potential to revive the series, it was a welcome addition to the series. So, if you are looking for the horror movie of the month, Jigsaw is your answer for the theater my friends. My scores: Crime/Horror/Mystery: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",Jigsaw
45,vengeance20,Bloody Amazing!,10,27 October 2017,"Since watching (then all 7 of the Saw Films) back in 2012, I was eagerly anticipating this one on it's release & was constantly checking on Google for a Saw 8 being release with fake trailers, to built up articles on the subject! Highs & Lows & hopes being lifted & dropped on this film ever being made until....it was then on Feb 2016, Jigsaw was on its way to being made! At first I took it with a pinch of salt, but then it grew & it was then known as Saw: Legacy! Casting started, Filming, then the official name, then the trailer! And finally the film!!!Having got back from a showing I must say this was awesome! The traps were epic! The twist was amazing & the whole story was simply a great tribute to the previous instalments! The 7 year wait was bloody worth it & any Saw Fan or Horror Fan alone should go & see this!Screw the haters (especially the Saw ones) who are too pussy to go & watch this, it's an awesome piece of film making that should be appreciated! I won't spoil too much as you should go & see this for yourself! I hope for a 9th entry in this amazing franchise!Overall, 10/10! Simply ace!",Jigsaw
46,lewiskendell,Another bloody puzzle to put together.,6,14 October 2018,"I'm surprised to find myself revisiting the Saw franchise. I'm a little fuzzy on which of the earlier entries I've seen, they all blend together in a haze of severed limbs, endless plot twists, and lots of screaming. It's no surprise, then, that Jigsaw primarily features severed limbs, endless plot twists, and lots of screaming. But a hiatus has done the series well. It feels less repetitive than it deserves, simply because I haven't seen a movie like this in quite some time. The plot essentially boils down to bad people being trapped in a deadly game that's designed to bring them to terms (usually via bloody maiming) with how badly they've treated others. There's a secondary plot that follows a group of detectives and medical examiners that are trying to puzzle out whether the title character has returned, after being believed to be dead for a decade.I enjoyed Jigsaw, but eventually a feeling of deja vu gradually began to creep in. There's really nothing new here, but fans of the previous movies in the series will probably find this to be an acceptable entry.",Jigsaw
47,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Jigsaw""- The infamous 'Saw' franchise returns with a solid and entertaining revival that should please longtime series fans",7,26 October 2017,"For seven years, the famous and rather infamous horror franchise ""Saw"" terrified audiences the world over with its brutal games of life and death and an enigmatic boogeyman for the ages in the form of series villain John Kramer also known by the moniker 'The Jigsaw Killer.' The brainchild of Australian filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the original 2004 film became a revolutionary title whose influence is still felt to this very day, and it later spawned six sequels, two video games, a prequel comic book and all sorts of other media spin- offs and merchandise. It became a legend in the world of horror, with millions of fans clamoring for more.So it should come as no surprise that after an extended absence, the franchise has returned with the belated continuation ""Jigsaw""- a sort-of semi-sequel and light reboot that follows the continuity of the original series while also taking the stories and characters in a new direction. And as someone who will shamelessly admit to being a die-hard fan of this franchise, I was quite fascinated but also very cautious during production. After all, too often these attempts at bringing new life to old properties fall flat and fail to recapture that wonderful ""lightning in a bottle"" that made the original such a resounding success.But thankfully, I am able to say with some confidence that fans of the series can rest easy. While it does suffer some of the clunky issues that plagued prior chapters, ""Jigsaw"" is nonetheless a fun, appropriately revolting and generally entertaining return to that devious world of mayhem and death. Boasting strong and stylish visual direction courtesy the remarkable Sperig brother and benefiting from an oft-clever script that piles on the twists, turns and guts like there's no tomorrow, it emerges as one of the better of the later sequels in now thirteen-year-old franchise. It might not win over new audiences... but longtime series fans will surely find a lot to love about ""Jigsaw.""Ten years have passed since the infamous ""Jigsaw Killer"" John Kramer (Tobin Bell) died in his final test, and the public has returned to peace. However, a startling series of events begins to unfold and it soon becomes clear a new ""game"" is afoot, sending the press, public and police detective Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie) into a state of panic. Could the Jigsaw Killer be back from the grave? Or has a copycat taken up where he left off? At the same time, five new test subjects awaken and are informed that they will face horrifying choices between life and death in order to survive... and that the key to their survival will involve confessing their past sins, no matter how dark or treacherous they may be...When it's at its best, ""Jigsaw"" manages to capture the frenzied and manic energy of previous follow-ups, while also injecting just enough of a delightful ""Whodunnit?"" mystery to keep the audience invested. I'd very favorably compare it to the earlier installments in the series in terms of entertainment value and creativity, though it has enough of an identity to be able to stand on its own. It is very much a ""Saw"" film through and through... It's got all the traps and twists you'd come to expect and features plenty of callbacks and references. But it's gotten just enough of a spit-and- polish to make it feel fresh even all these years later. The visual direction is very sharp, slick and modern. It trades in the down-and-dirty hand-held camera-work of previous installments for something a lot more sleek and up-to-date. The incredibly talented Sperig Brothers serve as directors this time around, and they do one heck of a job showcasing the guts, gore and general carnage. ""Saw"" has never looked this good. This is helped out tremendously by a fairly clever and well-paced script and some genuinely solid acting from all involved. Especially series regular Tobin Bell, who appears mainly in voice-over here. The film benefits greatly from his small but significant presence, and it helps tie the story together with what came before. I was also quite impressed with Matt Passmore and Hannah Emily Anderson, whom portray a couple of spunky pathologists who serve as major supporting characters. They have a great chemistry and do a very good job.However, the film is not without some major issues. The most noticeable being that it replicates one of the major faults that plagued the previous few installments- pacing and structure. The film is just too darned manic and tightly wound for its own good, and it does rob a lot of the atmosphere while also making the characters feel under- developed and one-dimensional. There's a great sequel somewhere in here... but it's brought down a few pegs due to its over-eagerness and hyperactive flow. I also felt that the film really didn't do enough plot-wise to justify such a long gap. It's essentially just a slightly ramped-up version of what we've seen before. It would have been nice if it took a few more risks.But still, as a massive fan of this franchise, I left the theater satisfied. I've been waiting seven long years to see ""Saw"" on the big screen again, and ""Jigsaw"" has only left me hungry for more. And I hope it won't be another seven years before we get a ninth entry! I give ""Jigsaw"" a pretty good 7 out of 10. It may not win over new audiences, but if you liked the previous films, get to the theater as quick as you can! Let the game begin anew!",Jigsaw

49,Abdulxoxo,Just another saw movie,6,11 February 2021,"If you're familiar with the 'Saw' franchise then the chances you already know the plot are astronomical. The best thing about these films is the 'games'. I know it's sick, but I love seeing all the inventive ways they physically and mentally destroy people.Yet again, in Jigsaw these are the best parts and although overall they weren't as good as in some of the other films, I still enjoyed them. It was however a massive disappointment whenever we moved away from that to follow the detectives try to figure out how to find where they were. In comparison to the maniacal Jigsaw's games, these parts of the movie were straight up dull; and it's the main problem I had with the other movies too. For the sake of the whole storyline I guess they are necessary, but I'd prefer if maybe 80% of the film remained with Jigsaw's victims. The actors were decent. If you know the franchise then you'll know to expect twists; and so I half worked out some of the twists long before they were revealed. Some I was surprised by though, which was good.If you're a fan of the franchise then you'll probably like Jigsaw fine enough; although the structure is very similar to what's come before it.",Jigsaw
50,Pumpkin_Man,Jigsaw Returns With a Vengeance!!!,10,29 October 2017,"I really enjoyed this new Saw movie. A good sequel and welcome addition to the series. It did feel very different than the rest of the series, though. The music, the traps, the nods and Tobin Bell helped it feel more like a Saw movie. Other than that, it felt like a horror version of Law & Order. It was better than most of the sequels in the series. The gore has been toned down a lot in this one, but that didn't bother me too much. There was one scene that I was so 'flabbergasted' that I felt like the last 11 years of my life were a lie. I was literally shivering with excitement during the last 5 minutes when they reveal the big twist, which was pretty cool. Ten years after the death of John Kramer/Jigsaw, a new game starts up, baffling Detectives Halloran and Hunt. Their only suspect has been shot and put into a coma. Meanwhile, five people wake up in a barn in a new trap. Jigsaw wants them to confess their sins, using all sorts of new deadly traps. Forensic pathologists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonnville help the Detectives with their case and try to figure out where the new game is being played. If you've been a Saw fan from the very beginning, you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend JIGSAW!!!",Jigsaw
51,lambiepie-2,Okay..it got me.,7,12 August 2018,"I went in with a preconceived notion of this film based on the trailers which I admit is something I need to stop doing. I am a fan of the original Saw - as it was an excellent concept for a horror film. Then came Saws upon Saws and I lost interest as it kept going through the Studio System ""Money Grab"" ploy. But then, this one came out, and while it had the same 'sorta' predictable elements - I waited until its cable debut to watch. And I grew interested as the story unfolded. For me, this is not a bad installment, or a jump start into a new idea based on an old one. What was better for me was seeing Tobin Bell reprise the iconic role and not rely on the ""Jigsaw"" tag, but what started out as a good concept to begin with. No need to call him..Jigsaw. But please feel free to call imitators that if need be. And that is the point.As I watched this I started thinking that the filmmakers were playing the audience for fools - a real big suspension of disbelief - to think that what inevitably happened to John, didn't. But I scored this high for the way the Speirig Brothers...actually didn't. So it got me there.To be realistic, it comes down to what you are watching this franchise for...is it 'the games'? The equation of morals? The paybacks? Trying to figure out is this good or bad or somewhere in between? I find it's a bit of all of it and it comes together, even if it can be slightly predictable at this point. But this one had an ending that I didn't quite see coming in the way it did, and it made me checking this one out, more worthwhile than I would have thought.",Jigsaw
52,Stephen_A_Abell,Not As Good As The Better SAW Films.,5,5 February 2018,"Friday Night Is Fright Night so I was happy to see that two of the better fright films have new Chapters to their stories. Therefore, I was looking forward to watching both this movie and the new Horror chapter to Jeepers Creepers... How wrong I was.Since they ended the SAW series on a high there was expectations for this movie to be good. The trailer was brilliant and atmospheric. I wanted to see this film, as I've always loved the concept I just thought most of the stories needed handling better, both story and film-wise. Though, as most cases prove nowadays, the trailer was much better than the movie.I know it's a SAW film by a different name so there's gonna be gore... which there was but nowhere near that of the other movies. The things which let the film and story down was the direction and the writing. There were plot holes big enough to pilot an armada of cruise liners through. The main one being the detective work... there wasn't any. For some unfathomable reason, both cops on the case decided that the coroner, Logan (Passmore) and his assistant, Eleanor (Anderson), were the main suspects. I could understand Eleanor, a little, as she posted to a website based on John Kramer (Bell) and his killings. However, they totally ignored everybody else on the site. Ludacris. As for the cops themselves, it wasn't a case of good cop and bad cop but rather a bad cop and poser cop. At least Cle Bennett (Detective Keith Hunt) looked good in this movie - not for his acting skills, but for his dress sense - and boy can he pose like a supermodel!Then there's the whole timeline thing. SAW has tried this scenario before and made a complete hash of it... and has once again. Though it's not as confusing as it's predecessor, there are still many oversights.All this is a shame as they finally had the chance to make a decent movie from a good premise. At least they had a good cast. On the whole, the acting is above par and all the actors give the best performances they can - I can't fault them at all. It would have been nice to have more emotion, which the writers chose not to pursue even though they had a great character to do it with and a good actress to pull it off. I'm talking about Anna (Vandervoort). On the surface, her backstory is that of a woman who has lost her child to an accident. This opens up a myriad of possible emotional scenes. Then when the twist in her story is revealed it gives a chance for a different depiction. This would make the character relatable to the viewers; bringing them into the story a tad more. The same can be said for most of the characters, though you only need to expand on the main ones.As for the gruesome special effects, they've been toned down for this film, which isn't a bad thing as they were starting to get too graphic (never thought I'd say that... but when you see a face get ripped off by a car tyre... well). However, there could, and should, have been more of the human claret flowing, especially in the leg scene.This really could and should have been a better film. A statement that can nearly be said for the all the films in the series... so this suffers as the majority of the SAW films did. Therefore, I'd only recommend this to followers of the series. As for newbies, then I'd recommend watching the originals over this, at least, for a while, there's a feeling of freshness about them.",Jigsaw

The bloody trap and the out of nowhere plot twist, in the end, is still there but none of it make me sick to my stomach or make my eyes roll for how ridiculous it is.

56,juliankennedy23,Circular saw would have been a more accurate title.. just saying.,7,14 October 2018,"Jigsaw: 7 out of 10: Hey it is a Saw movie. Questions abound in the eighth film in the series such as is ""The Jigsaw Killer"", John Kramer still alive? Is there a copycat killer? What is up with the corrupt detective or the war veteran coroner who looks just like Dexter. Needless to say, victims and traps abound as there is murdering and revenge afoot. The Good: There are some very nice traps in this one. The this shotgun shell is the key to your escape is probably being one of the best of the series. The film itself is well directed with a very good pace. There are plenty of characters (trap fodder) and the movie wastes no time getting to the reason people watch Saw films. Special effects are also top-notch and though the filmmakers are quoted as saying they wanted to concentrate less on the gore I would say that gore fans will not walk away disappointed.The Bad: The first Saw was a masterclass in horror filmmaking. Okay, maybe not a masterclass (Had it just stayed in the room with Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell it would have been a masterclass but a revisit to the film after fifteen years will reveal there is actually a lot of outside plot and Danny Glover of all people.) Here we are seven sequels out and well some lessons have not exactly been learned. There is enough plot here for two movies at least. Being the eighth film there is an unfortunate desire to wrap all the logic into a nice bow leaving an exposition at the end that would do Hercule Poirot proud. To whom this lengthy explanation of who, how and why dunnit is for outside of the forth wall audience is a headscratcher, however.There is also some many niggling little things that add up. How does the killer even know of some the sins of the victims? You will feel like a senator at a Supreme Court Justice nomination as revenge is taken upon adults for drunken teenage sins that took place in the eighties and had no witnesses. Did the killer find an old calendar with drunk driving escapade circled?The Ugly: Hannah Emily Anderson plays the coroners assistant Emily with a secret fascination into the Jigsaw killers. She is great, she is wonderful, she is missing from the second half of the movie. I mean I understand she is a red-headed herring but seriously she is the best thing in your movie by far. Certainly a better protagonist than Dexter lite Matt Passmore.In Conclusion: A solid, if overplotted, horror movie with decent scares, good effects, and some memorable scenes. Worth it certainly for fans of the Saw series though non-fans will be understandably confused by the various jumps between all the characters.",Jigsaw
57,fernandoschiavi,"Jigsaw is a thriller with good moments and twists that work (others not), but unfortunately, it doesn't have enough force to resurrect an already worn narrative line",6,14 June 2021,"Starting with a police chase scene that seems to bring a desired freshness to the franchise - as all the other films start directly in one of the death traps -, soon the plot decays and appeals to all the clichés used extensively in the previous ones. After the appearance of a body that has all the usual characteristics referring to the ""murders"" of serial killer Jigsaw, two police officers and a couple of forensic doctors set out to search for the culprit in the crime, who can be unbelievably credited to John Kramer (Tobin Bell, of ""12 Feet Deep""), who died and was buried ten years ago. All this in parallel, of course, with the endless fatal ambushes for half a dozen victims in a kind of barn.Directed by brothers Michael and Peter Spierig, Jigsaw came to add another chapter to the franchise, but it's not a sequel to the seventh film, meaning we're not going to see what happened after we found out that doctor Dr. Gordon is who was behind the previous games. For those who don't remember, this character was one of the first Jigsaw victims in the first movie. However, the eighth film brings nostalgic and nostalgic elements from the previous films. Anyone who watched the franchise will better understand some scenes, capture the references, identify certain arsenals used in the games and, of course, kill the longing for Jigsaw. Anyone who hasn't seen the other features may not understand certain plot points, but that doesn't mean you'll be lost in the story. You can watch it, but I suggest you watch the others.The script written by the duo Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg, responsible for Piranha 3D and Piranha 2, even tries to create some suspense with the investigation of who may be imitating Jigsaw, but the main highlight for those nostalgic for the franchise is following the group of victims suffering in the super traps. Highlight for a kind of deadly cylinder operated by a motorcycle.... Gone are the days of small and efficient saws or devices stuck in the jaws of victims.... Since the second film, a real apparatus of traps has been built and the new chapter is not far behind.The story doesn't bring a thorough investigation, but the development of this arc is balanced and merges with the game, which, by the way, is less bloody, especially if we compare the seventh chapter that sought to maximize the potential of 3D. If in previous films we see heads exploding, jaws ripped out, pools of syringes and bodies crushed and split in half, in Jigsaw the audience is faced with more practical, faster and less ingenious pitfalls in their execution and a little less exploration in the despair of each victim. The reason will be understood later, but suffice it to say that they were devices created early on, when John Kramer decided to become Jigsaw. But the move is the same, that is, one always ends up dying after the phase is completed. This time, the biggest highlight is the burial with seeds and a laser mask.Since the subject is a script, what about Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg (""Piranha 3D""), who copy almost all the proposals and solutions from the previous features. An even greater feat falls on the shoulders of the duo of director brothers Michael and Peter Spierig (from the interesting ""Predestination"") as they manage to destroy the last breath of originality in the entire franchise, which is the invention and creativity of traps and absurd deaths. The search for the new serial killer is intriguing as it is led by equally suspicious people: The Jigsaw fan, the person with a personal trauma, the corrupt investigator, etc. Everyone passes away from the hero model, and this creates distrust in the viewer, where anyone can be involved or hiding secrets.At some point, the plot splits into two narrative lines. One reasonably interesting, one downright boring. The first involves those prisoners who need to atone for their guilt. This format is very reminiscent of the first chapters of the series, and manages to lend a renewed freshness to old fans. With each new challenge, Jigsaw invariably offers its victims a chance to escape unscathed. Confronting your own truths, however, often ends up costing too much, and not everyone is ready to pay the price, even if it means a leg or deep scars. There's a cat-and-mouse feeling, combined with an almost detective mystery: how to solve the next puzzle? At the same time, however, we are constantly faced with the procedures of police officers and medical examiners, the discovery of new suspects and various false paths that lead to clues that are mostly irrelevant. It reaches the point of questioning what is the real relationship between one plot and another. And when, finally, one plot meets the other, the expectation has already been deflated and the solution indicated falls far short of any bet contemplated on it.The character development, acting and dialogue are not brilliant - often not even average - but they held his attention and suspicion for a while. When the mystery begins to abuse its good will, the plot introduces a twist that goes a little beyond just pointing out the person responsible, in one of the worst plot twists of today and certainly the worst in the franchise. The revelation this time is not so plausible and unconvincing. Instead of running a story that served as a reboot, the script fails to continue the plot of previous films, which already showed fatigue. On one side is the group of victims who are Anna (Laura Vandervoot), Carly (Brittany Allen), Mitch (Mandela Van Peebles), Ryan (Paul Braunstein) and a fifth person who dies instantly. On the other side, you have the group behind the investigation, like detectives Halloran (Callun Keith Rennie) and Keith Hunt (Clé Bennett) and coroners Logan Nelson (Matt Passmore) and Eleanor Bonneville (Hannah Emily Anderson). Audiences are made aware of the acts that bring each victim into the game (one of my favorite parts of all the movies), but they also discover the true intentions of investigators. One of the biggest doubts of the audience was to find out how the producers, screenwriters and director would bring back the main character, since he has been dead for years. That's where the film's surprise lies, as the great turn of the story explains not only the intentions of each character, but also the presence of John Kramer.In addition to not creating anything new in terms of concept or aesthetics, when they fail to create a reason for people to continue walking through the rat mazes programmed by Jigsaw, the traps and their results lose all ability to frighten and provoke the famous "" anxiety mixed with disgust"" in the audience. The way Saw compensated for its weak center arc in the past was with graphic violence and well-crafted traps created on top of every troublesome character who would become the victim. The brutal stomach-churning scenes have become the series' trademarks, largely responsible for popularizing the term ""torture porn"" to describe a subgenre of films with a great deal of gore appeal. In Jigsaw, it's not like that. What worked so well was the fact that the killings were not gratuitous within the context of the work. The killer had a purpose: to punish the victim for despising his own life, with his addiction or crime directly reflected in the challenge. The traps were puzzles to be solved - the most memorable, at least.Jigsaw still uses this principle. The game that Anna, Mitch and the other hostages participate in makes you bite your nails from time to time, and are even based on the mistakes of each participant, but the traps themselves are not very inventive. Without the complexity of finding a way out to heighten the tension, the film appeals to stupid characters who just take their time to make decisions in the hope that it will be enough to take their breath away. There is a sense of cowardice, because even though there are some points of violence between one stretch of the film and another, we feel that the traps are still deadly, but without the terrifying virtuosity of its predecessors. It's also possible that we've seen so much in the franchise that any physical destruction of characters on the scene doesn't impact as before.Again indeed, directors Michael and Peter Spierig bring a different twist to the mise-en-scène, taking away the green and dark palette of previous films in the franchise and creating spooky daylight scenes, something innovative and quite interesting. The brothers did well playing with different timelines in the futuristic thriller The Predestined (2014). However, they can't let go of that hit and disproportionately insist on repeating the effect in Jigsaw. Schematic - from a certain point onwards, the solutions start to repeat themselves, making the experience in front of the film monotonous and predictable - and redundant - the need to explain every detail, through unnecessary flashbacks, becomes irritating - it cannot do justice to the best moments of the series, although it doesn't turn out to be a complete disaster either. Jigsaw is a thriller with good moments and twists that work, but unfortunately, it doesn't have enough force to resurrect an already worn narrative line.",Jigsaw

It is the eighth installment in the Saw franchise, picking up over a decade after the death of the eponymous Jigsaw killer, during the police investigation of a new succession of murders that fit his modus operandi.Tobin Bell reprises his role as as John Kramer a.k.a. Jigsaw. The rest of the cast is mostly new to me. The background music score and sound-effects are decent as well as the photography and special-effects which are the staple of a Spierig brother's film. The acting is also decent but doesn't leave a lasting impression in your memory. There is ample gore and violence in the film to satisfy horror film fans however this film is more or less in the ""forgettable"" range and does little to enhance the franchise. For me the best movie was the first one Saw (2004), directed by James Wan and written by both him and Leigh Whannel. Darren Lynn Bousman directed 
the sequel Saw I (2005) and later subseqent two movies Saw 3(2006) and Saw 4(2007). For me the departure of Wan from the post of director marked the slow death of the franchise, even though Bousman made a brave effort at reviving the franchise in the fourth film. I",Jigsaw

Jigsaw sets itself apart from the previous franchise picking up a story ten years after the death of John Kramer (Tobin Bell). The story does utilize multiple timelines as it has done in other films to confuse the viewer but since this has happened several times before the shock has worn off. Detective Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie) is called to a chase when a perp Edgar Munsen (Josiah Black) demand he speak with him. Edgar claims that if he presses the button on a transmitter then the game will begin and right as he does, five people wake up with buckets on their head and chains around their necks.Halloran and his partner Detective Keith Hunt (Clé Bennett) shoot Edgar in the hand but one bullet hits him in the chest. He's put into a coma so they can't get any answers. Bodies do start showing up around the city. Medical examiner Logan Nelson (Matt Passmore) is called in to look at the victims finding a microchip in the puzzle piece wound on the decapitated man's neck. His colleague Eleanor Bonneville (Hannah Emily Anderson) has a strange fascination with Jigsaw and his murders making Halloran suspect there might be something more there.

One or two plot holes which of course I will not give away. My biggest problem with the film is why?

64,kjproulx,Better Than Most Of The Sequels,6,1 November 2017,"The Saw franchise went downhill since the original back in 2004. Though it was assumed to have ended in 2010, another sequel has arrived seven years later. My main concern with this was the fact that it was probably going to end up being another film that's made for fans of violence and gore, who enjoy this series just for the traps and who makes it out alive. While Jigsaw is exactly that, there are many more layers to this film than I was expecting, making for a somewhat enjoyable viewing experience. I won't be recommending this movie to anyone who has never seen a previous installment, nor will I recommend it to those who have and have disliked it from the beginning. Jigsaw isn't going to win any new fans over, but in terms of popcorn horror entertainment, I think you can still do much worse than Jigsaw. It tries very hard to please hardcore fans, and I truly believe that it does so. This really isn't all that great of a movie, but let's dive into why it's better than it deserves to be.Like always, you follow the police as they try to solve the mystery of the ongoing puzzle so that they can try and save as many lives as possible. These films exist for their traps nowadays, but I have to give credit where credit is due and offer some applause to the neat little twists this movie pulls off throughout its final act. Like most of these sequels, the twists are too little and too late, but you can tell that the writers care about trying to give the audience a little more than just killing people in inventive ways.The characters throughout this film receive some backstory, but that's also the biggest issue I had with this movie as a whole. Looking back on it, I appreciate the fact that each of the characters throughout the core game was fleshed out more than I was expecting them to be, but they honestly make you hate every one of the players, which was a huge distraction from me, having absolutely nobody to root for. Yes, the majority of these movies are like that, but there was always someone to latch onto, hoping they would make it out alive. Instead, we receive a slew of characters that have all made terrible decisions in the past, forcing you to slightly be okay with what the killer is doing to them.Although I didn't care about any of the characters, Jigsaw found a way to win me over in the end, with a few very clever reveals, making the characters themselves seem less relevant anyway. You don't go into a Saw movie to see fleshed out characters, but when a movie can ground itself and invest you even in the slightest, points can be given for that. The character of John Kramer is the character who's fleshed out the most here, giving a small, but detailed level to the franchise itself, which was quite the surprise for me.The deaths themselves are pretty impressive in terms of being memorable because everything from Saw IV to Saw VII is a complete blur to me. I'll be remembering some of the set pieces when looking back on Jigsaw and that's easily more than I was able to say about most of the sequels that this franchise has offered through the years. There are nods to previous deaths throughout some of the games and there's definitely a reason behind that, which makes it worth waiting until the end.Overall, like I said, Jigsaw won't win over any new viewers, but fans of the franchise will be able to appreciate the cleverness that it has to offer when it ties itself into the timeline of the series. The dialogue is very generic, the story itself isn't anything you haven't already seen, and the characters are extremely forgettable. That being said, the traps are fun, the conclusion is satisfying for those who have followed the series from the beginning, and the spirit of the original is still present enough to warrant a recommendation for hardcore fans. Jigsaw works for what it sets out to achieve, but it's still the same old schtick. I had a fun time with this movie because I've seen every other film in the franchise and I still found this one of the best. It's really not that bad in retrospect.",Jigsaw
65,kuarinofu,"Good watch, but will probably disappoint hardcore fans",7,1 December 2018,"I've seen the original 7 films some time ago so my memories of the idea of SAW aren't fresh. I think this helped me to cope with this movie. I didn't find it insulting as many fans did though.
I knew who the game master was almost instantly, since movie gives you a lot of clues. But they still had a second twist, which, however, was so full of holes it can be easily destroyed with facts. Still not that bad IMO.
The traps were just meh and I wish they had more real gore (not CGI). It doesn't give you too much tension cause most of the characters (and the things they've done) are not particularly interesting and you don't feel for them or wish they would get a second chance.
The movie as a whole was made competently, well paced, short and tight. It had almost no pointless or slow scenes. I think if the original SAW movies never existed and this was a standalone movie it would've been an instant cult classic. But when you connect them and compare, it just comes as passable.
And I have to admit that a big part of the 7 stars I gave this movie is Hannah Emily Anderson and her character. Jesus Christ, her looks and performance in this...uncovered some of the dark secrets in me as a man I didn't even knew I've had. She is a woman I will not forget any time soon.",Jigsaw
66,DarthVoorhees,Runs on fumes to give old 'Saw' fans a mild jolt of nostalgia.,5,28 November 2017,"I won't lie I was a huge fan of the 'Saw' series during it's heyday in the 00's. It became a Halloween tradition to revisit them and pick apart their secrets. The DVD's were will worn especially the first one. And so seeing 'Jigsaw' was kind of a nostalgic trip... and really it was like revisiting an old friend you've kind of outgrown. That isn't to say I didn't like it because it is essentially the same thing as the previous entries. This is really just for the people who were hardcore fans of 'Saw' nobody else is going to get anything from it mainly because it takes absolutely no risks at all. I know having a lack of ingenuity is not a new criticism for horror films but 'Saw' kept me a little more interested because of Tobin Bell and the depths of his character. That being said it should be no surprise that 'Jigsaw's lack of Tobin Bell results in it being a sub par 'Saw' film. The thing that kept me coming back to 'Saw' year after year was Tobin Bell. The problem was they eventually killed him (and truth be told 'Saw III' was a perfect ending). In 'Saw IV' they realized you could revisit his character in flashbacks, the effect was that the series time line and chronologically became extremely convoluted. I have to give 'Saw' a little credit as they tried their damnedest to juggle these story threads and try to make some sense of the whole thing as new killers and accomplices were added to Jigsaw's master plans. It sort of worked but in keeping with having this slim sense of semi-credible storytelling Bell's John Kramer was reduced to less and less screen time as the series fizzled out to it's finish. 'Jigsaw's greatest challenge and storytelling conceit is to how they bring back Bell. Leave it to them they do it and it sort of works in a cool way with the 'Saw' tradition of playing with chronological storytelling. Honestly though it probably would have been easier to remake or reboot 'Saw'. I don't see how 'Jigsaw' can bring back the series because an already complicated narrative will become impossible to follow by the seeds planted here.That's really all there is to say. No other character is going to be as interesting as Bell's John Kramer. The movie can be a chore when he is not on screen(and really his presence is nothing but an extended cameo). Fans of 'Saw's gore and macabre traps and settings are going to be very disappointed in 'Jigsaw'. It is far too clean and sterile looking a movie. Also although not a criticism 'Jigsaw' is very mild, Bryan Fuller's 'Hannibal' had far more explicit gore on network television. It doesn't really work well but I must admit I did get a wave of horror nostalgia when John Kramer came back. It's a totally unnecessary film but it was worth a cheap Halloween matinée.",Jigsaw

70,Rickting,A return to form... sort of anyway,6,26 October 2017,"Saw is back and Jigsaw has returned to reclaim Halloween. But, you'll immediately find yourself confused. After all, Jigsaw has been dead for many years. As soon as you start watching a lot of things just don't make even a hint of sense. Everything seems jumbled up... until the film's many twists and turns become clear and, with yet another rising crescendo of the iconic theme tune, a series of flashbacks, big reveals and gory images, a Saw film once more concludes seemingly laughing at its audience and said audience will once more leave feeling sick to the stomach and very confused. Yep, Saw is back... for better or for worse? In this case, for better. Kind of. After the horrendous last installment, the only good part of Jigsaw's legacy was the roller coaster at Thorpe Park. Now... maybe things could be back on track. It hasn't redeemed the franchise; the usual bad acting, logic gaps and lack of genuine scares still applies. But at the same time, this installment prioritizes thought provoking moral themes and tension over gore and flashbacks and it is an intense, unsettling experience. With memorable death scenes, a reasonable amount of tension and a relatively solid plot, this should be satisfying enough to most. It doesn't entirely feel like Saw since virtually no-one, not even those still alive, returns from the previous films and the grimy, unclean atmosphere of the old films is replaced by a cleaner, more high-tech vibe, but many will like the various nods to the past movies. 6/10",Jigsaw

Somehow I ended up in the theater watching this one. (Oh yeah, I get paid to watch movies.) It's basically what I expected: a gory, torture movie. Yuck. Presented by Twisted Pictures, this is just a twisted, sick movie. Saw fans will probably enjoy it, since it has been many years since the last movie.which was actually supposed to be the last movie in the series.

Is it me or has Halloween become more freaky, creepy and sick lately? I hear that the first 7 films in the Saw franchise had odd color and sound effects, but this one looks more professionally made. It takes those popular ""Room Escape"" concepts to a new level. Have you ever been to any of those? I've been to a few in several different cities and got a kick out of them. Twist. I love twists in movies.Things I didn't like: The plot doesn't make sense. It's just demented.Tips for parents: This is a messed up movie.

75,PyroSikTh,Cliché Twist. Dull Traps. Filled with Nonsense.,4,18 February 2020,"Jigsaw is the movie that was never meant to be made. Saw VII was billed the final chapter, but I can't say it gave a particularly satisfactory ending to seven non-stop years of storytelling. The big draw was Dr. Gordon coming back and he was barely in it, only there to bring the franchise full circle in a closing sequence that marked the best of that entire movie. So in a sequel that takes place 7-10 years later (the time lapse of the franchise isn't exactly clear), Dr. Gordon would feature prominently right? Wrong. He's not even mentioned. The identity of his two goons are never touched upon either. No mention of Hoffman either, making his fate just as implied as the end of VII. The only dangling threads from the 'final chapter' remain dangling.No, this is a whole new story with a copycat leaving bodies in public places all over the city. We follow two detectives who suspect the morticians for some unmentioned reason, and the two morticians trying to clear their names and prove it wasn't them while also saving the day themselves. There's some interesting ideas and concepts here, such as a Jigsaw fansite on the dark web (which can't be traced, and even if it could, anyone using it would be using a VPN anyway, but I digress), and one of the morticians owning a collection of trap replicas, implying some kind of underground cult following, but this angle is never explored (maybe the subtitle of Spiral hints at this?). Instead the story ultimately leans back on a tired cliché of the franchise; a new apprentice who was there from the beginning! Except at this point it makes no sense whatsoever, occurs due to the most contrived and lazy reasoning that cheapens Kramer's philosophy, and ends up just coming across like a Hoffman rip-off. Been there, done that, can we get something new next time?But let's be honest, the last few Saw films haven't exactly had great storylines either. V was dull and uneventful, VI's success lay more in its multi-trap and Kramer-flashbacks, and VII's only good story moments happened at the very end. At this point in the franchise, most people (not me) are going into it for the traps, torture, and gore. Jigsaw will disappoint those fans too, unfortunately. For starters the big multi-trap relies on too many coincidences and things going exactly as planned. If the purse-thief died in the opening room, all five of them would have been screwed immediately. If the motorbike seller died at any point in the previous three rooms, then his trap would have completely gone to waste. What if the arrogant man wasn't the impatient one ignoring the signs and someone else got their leg trapped? What if no-one got their leg trapped? Kramer makes a big point in the second movie about planning for every eventuality, but this is clearly not that. But this wouldn't have mattered half as much if the traps were actually good. The first room is just a variation of the first room in the multi-trap of Saw V, the leg trap felt like a hollow homage to Dr. Gordon in the first movie, the antidote trap was nice and intimate, but she figures it out with plenty of time and then just screams at everyone rather than getting on with it, the silo was just lazy; throwing blades at people stuck neck-deep in grain. I'll admit though, the shotgun trap at the end was very clever and really felt like the only one in the same vein as the traps in earlier movies. Talking of traps in earlier movies, at least they all pertained to the participants' sin. The PR woman in VII had her throat punctured because she was the mouthpiece of the fraud, the insurance guy in VI constantly had to weigh up which lives were worth saving the same way his company did, the drug dealer in II was meant to wade through used needles, Officer Rigg was put to the task of understanding and sympathising with Jigsaw by making the same judgment calls, etc etc. Here they're just random traps randomly assigned to random participants for random reasons. The only one that actually related was the antidote having the cash amount that was stolen written on it, but even then having to choose between antidote and acid had nothing to do with stealing purses. And lastly the setting was nice and different, but a wooden barn just wouldn't work. Why did no-one think about using the farming tools to break through the wooden walls? There's a reason why the grime and claustrophobia of industrial complexes worked so well in all seven movies.The absolute worst part of this movie's multi-trap is the return of Kramer himself and the twist that entails. Okay so I'll lay this out first, Tobin Bell coming back as Kramer in the flesh was amazing and easily the best part of the entire movie, and the twist that this actually takes place in 2003 certainly surprised me despite the timey wimey twists of Saw II and IV already setting that precedent. However it doesn't make any sense that the multi-twist takes place in 2003. For starters, the technology is all wrong. Billy has light-up glowing red eyes and looks all clean and pristine, and when he appears on TV screens, it's in HD on a flat screen. This wouldn't have been impossible in 2003 of course, but this was brand new technology at that time. I remember being a pre-teen wowed at the prospect of in-home widescreen, let alone HD and flat screen. The TVs used are absolutely modern ones. Unless Jigsaw travelled to the future, grabbed a bunch of HDTVs, and used his time there to foresee how the trap was going to go, this doesn't make sense. Furthermore, this multi-trap feels like those used in V, VI, and VII, after Kramer had died. Those were Hoffman traps, not Jigsaw ones. Otherwise he, what, made an elaborate, clairvoyant multi-trap, figured it was a bad idea despite its apparent success, and went back to reverse bear traps, locking two guys in a bathroom, and suspending someone from the roof with a corset trap? Don't buy it.All right, all right, this is all starting to sound very nitpicky. And it is. I love the first four movies of this franchise and I yearn to return to that level of quality. Even V and VI have their moments despite their glaring narrative flaws. But here's my biggest nitpick of the whole thing; it doesn't even look like a Saw movie. I don't think I ever really took notice of it before, but this latest rewatch made me realise that the entire franchise has a unique visual quality to it. It's one of the things that made VII feel so off, but even that looks more like a Saw movie than Jigsaw does. Jigsaw just looks like a modern-day TV movie. The colouring is bland, everything is clean and crisp, there's way too much daylight, sequences of panic are filmed straight and so just come off as people yelling at each other, and don't get me started on that last bit of CGI gore ripped straight out of a Resident Evil movie. While it might look a little dated today, there are certain elements that made a Saw film look like a Saw film. It was always dark with high contrast making the shadows even deeper, largely covering up for how cheap all the sets looked, but it worked, the sets themselves were always grimy and dirty, giving off a bit of a Se7en vibe (in fact I always thought of the original Saw movie as a horror homage to Se7en), there was always a sickly green glow coming from somewhere, and more crucially traps were almost always unveiled with frantic camerawork shaking, rotating, and cutting to show the panic and disorientation of the subject. All of that is missing from Jigsaw. All of it.Did I like anything about Jigsaw? Yes. I liked Tobin Bell coming back. He is the franchise and the movie wouldn't have been the same without him. It made me question where the movie was going and had me guessing all the way, so that's a big plus, but his presence just dominates everything, and I can't believe he hasn't struck it bigger in the last ten years. I also liked the character of Eleanor, and not just because I have a thing for hot redheads covered in tattoos. Her character promised something new and fresh for this franchise, a way to continue things on without having to constantly be tying back to Kramer every movie. The fansite, the makeshift trap museum, it could all lead to something bigger than Kramer could ever be. I also kind of like Halloran's character as well. I've been keeping my eye out for Callum Keith Rennie ever since his sinister turn in Harper's Island, but much like Tobin Bell has never managed to strike it big. Halloran was shaping up to be a bit like a Hoffman character but on the other side of the law; reckless and brutish with little regard for human life. I'm just gutted he didn't make it to the end to return in a follow-up.Jigsaw is a cleaner, modern take on the franchise, much to its detriment. It's lazy and uninspiring, both in story and traps, which is crushingly disappointing coming from the Spierig brothers, who nailed twists and unpredictable narratives in Predestination, and both gore and unique visual qualities in Daybreakers. It has its moments, like every movie in the franchise does, but to be honest I liked it a lot more last night than I do now that I've thought about it. I give it a bad 4/10, tied in last place with Saw VII. If I do another rewatch, and providing Spiral doesn't build off moments set in motion here (like the fansite and hint of underground cults), I probably won't even bother with this. Instead of adding to the original movies, it sort of ruins them by not fitting in at all and screwing with it all too much. I'd much rather ignore this movie's existence entirely.

77,baileycrawly,One Step Too Far,2,28 December 2019,"Have you ever heard of a movie or TV show that decided to go out on a high note, when they were well loved by the majority and the public was actually asking for more? It's a rare occurrence because money speaks louder than public opinion, but it does happen from time to time.This is not one of those times. With Saw 3D, the series ended on an absolute high note. It had its high points and its low points but, at the end of the day, it ended with a bang that was truly satisfying to watch. It wrapped everything up nicely.The decision to go forward with this movie is akin to the decision Fox made all those years ago to continue The Simpsons into Season 11 and beyond; it took something that could've been legendary and truly special and turned it into just another hollow, soulless shell of its former self. Had the franchise ended with Saw 3D, it would've been known as a flawed yet charming slasher franchise with a jumbled timeline that requires multiple viewings to fully understand. Yet this entry cements the franchise as almost laughable.There's ultimately no purpose for this film's existence. I can't figure out what demographic they're trying to reach and I have no idea who's been asking for this. There comes a time when you need to learn to let go and move on.That being said, there's one notable occasion where a series was ""ended"" and brought back successfully, which would be with ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare"" and Wes Craven's ""New Nightmare."" But this isn't New Nightmare. The reason New Nightmare worked so well was because the original creator of the franchise had something to say and he had an interesting and engaging way to say it. He used the seventh entry in the series - ultimately being a revival of sorts, albeit rather short-lived - to do something fresh and truly original.This is a steaming pile of more of the same that we've seen throughout the Saw franchise. The gore doesn't satisfy, the games are bland and uninspired, the actual plot devoid of substance. It's an insult to the series and everything that made it enjoyable in the first place.And apparently they're doing another one in 2020. Just goes to drive the point even deeper: money speaks louder than quality or integrity. The Jigsaw Killer's games will continue whether we want them or not, and the only thing he's hurting by continuing is his own legacy.

It's a story fraught with logical problems, but it's entertaining enough to please fans of the franchise (of whom I am one). Based on my own enjoyment of the movie, I'd rate it an 8 out of 10.Yes, some of it doesn't makes sense. And the twists and coincidences seem pretty forced. There was another problem for me, as well — at this point, the writers seem to have run out of ideas for the film series' trademark moralizing booby traps. (The one involving a grain silo is particularly uninspired, and seems like something out a Bugs Bunny cartoon.)But what the hell. I'd be lying if I said that this was a movie that didn't distract and scare me. I think what attracts me to the ""Saw"" films is not the blood and gore. (Gory horror movies are a dime a dozen.) It's the character concept behind their brilliant, merciless killer — he's like a combination of James Moriarty, Rube Goldberg and one of the Inquisitors of old.Besides, I still like the twists. They may be forced, but they always take me by surprise despite my best efforts to predict them.And I think every movie is made better by the addition of Callum Keith Rennie. (He's a shady, grizzled police detective here, though he's far better than so clichéd a role.)

The traps are quite forgettable this time but the twists and turns were very good as I didn't see that coming in the end.An attempt being made by the directors to make it comparable with the first two installments.

Seen it using my unlimited card...if not I would have demanded my money back...instead I need my 90 minutes back. where on earth did it get a 7.8 from with just 1 review..I think this needs to be investigated...and this will be rush released to cash in for Christmas.As things go it doesn't get worse than this.

85,CountJonnie,"Unnecessary, unoriginal, unprovoking",5,5 March 2019,"Saw was an amazing series. And even while it was going down as it progressed, it was still entertaining for various twists, while staying mildly connected to the original. Untill it was done, the game was over, and Jigsaw was dead. Or is he?That is the question that will haunt the viewer, and the new victims. Is Jigsaw dead? Who is who, and who did what? Who is guilty and how will they be punished, in a new but familiar cat and mouse game.If you have read the above, everything might indeed seem familiar, because you've seen it all before. The movie is still worth a 5, for some decent acting, a creepy atmosphere, some entertaining gadgets and a little gore. Other than that, the movie is useless and an insult for adding a new yet seen before twist as a lame excuse to keep a series going on, after it should've been dead and buried.

87,Jerique,An interesting addition to the series but falls flat.,6,8 November 2017,"After a long wait for the inevitable sequel, hardcore Saw fans will find themselves disappointed with this one.Tobin Bell and his cast all do a great job in their respective roles. I was very excited for a new film in the series and was hoping to not only get answers to the questions raised in the final minutes of Saw 3D, but was hoping to see some familiar faces.All hope was dashed. Jigsaw follows a linear plot of who-done-it? mixed with a trap that feels present day. However, in the final minutes of the film, all of what we've seen involving the farm test has taken place ten years previously and Logan has been on a mission to seek vengeance on Detective Hollaran. Although at first glance this film seems to be connected to the previously iterations, it really isn't. Logan has a connection to John Kramer after ten years previously mis-naming Kramer on an x-ray causing his cancer to go undiagnosed. The so-called plot twist has a hint of reveal showing Logan's scarred back earlier in the film, and when Hollaran is near-death the twist is revealed completely along with Logan's mission. It doesn't feel like a Saw film. It comes off as more of spin-off. I think I would've preferred Jigsaw faking his death and actually being alive in this film. I would've preferred if Dr. Gordon or Hoffman made an appearance. If Costas or Cary were unavailable, the writers should have waited and included their stories in this film. If this is the last Saw film (box office worldwide has already claimed five times the production budget, so maybe not) then fans can feel cheated. Having to wait half-a-dozen years for a one-off story barely connected to the saga of Jigsaw doesn't really seem worth it. It was stated by the directors that this one isn't as vicious and it certainly does play to that. The trap(s) are more of what was seen in Saw V and the gore is toned down till the bitter end where the real Saw-esque stuff shows up briefly. One positive I can say about the film, it's immensely better than Saw V, and the structure is much more polished than previous iterations in the series. Taking the time to put crucial details into the script paid off in one sense, but all the other issues with the film completely overlook the great effort on the screenplay. My hope is that if Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures bring a ninth film on, I hope it ties back to Saw 3D stories and bring back the characters that have been left unfinished (Hoffman, Gordon, etc.).",Jigsaw

Jigsaw (2017) stains it.Seven years after the last Saw film, Saw 3D (2010), Jigsaw (2017) tries to revive the franchise by giving it a fresher tone. In this film, 10 years have passed since the Jigsaw killings.The main topic of this film is very straightforward: when more corpses start to appear, the idea of a Jigsaw copycat becomes alive. But the film experiments with something else: is John Kramer behind the murders? The idea of John being alive makes no sense after the events of the previous films, but yes, this is the main topic explored in this film.The storyline is clever, but the overall plot falls flat with some dumb additions to the old story. These additions make no sense compared to what we watched in the previous films. They raise so many questions in your mind you just want to pretend this movie is about something else. Well, shame on you, it is not.The last nail in the coffin for me about this film is the acid humor. Unnecessary.In the end, this film just feels like it is just trying to milk the franchise's money-cow one more time. The games are mediocre.

The traps was rubbish and not Rememberable by any chance. I ranked jigsaw worst than saw 7 & saw 5. The characters was stupid and annoying. It didn't feel like a saw film tbh. Tobin Bell was good as john Kramer as always. But I felt it wasn't necessary to have his character init. Because this was meant to be a fresh start for the saw franchise. Most of the plot is about the cops thinks that John can be alive still lol it's so stupid. They even dig up his coffin to make sure his really dead. So dumb. I think the saw franchise is dead with jigsaw now. Don't waste your money going to see jigsaw in cinemas. The ending was so flat. I really wanted to like jigsaw sadly I didn't.

The storied score of the infamous Jigsaw, (John Kramer), seems to keep finding ways to resurrect the man. Granted, I like Tobin Bell and he brings a sense of empathy towards the character. In each and every film there seems to be a relative or tie that binds the games to him.The traps in this film were not gore fested, not even ingenious. The characters were plausible and only a couple had ties to the origin. NOW, with all that being said these films do lend a twist and turn in each case, however, I was able to see the outcome of this one 20 minutes into it.

This suggests to me that these reviewers must be members of the cast or crew, or have friends or relatives who are. Such a shame. 
The honest reviewers quite rightfully slam the movie, e.g.the person who awarded this ""motion picture"" 1/10 and titled his review ""Astronomically terrible - an insult to the franchise!"". Yes, I agree 100%.

No one really stood out that much except for the legendary Tobin Bell who plays Jigsaw (which you see in flashbacks). The direction was fine, and the entire set up was fine. Another thing we will say is that the entire pace of the film moved along very nicely, never a dull moment. There are loads of killings in the movie and each kill is done in a very stylized way so needless to say the body count is very high! To be honest The Saw Movies have just got old and it's time to stop making them. It's just getting way too much. There's nothing wrong with this movie really, it's all good fun and it's decent stuff, but it's just time to stop with these Jigsaw Movies.

107,marc5477,Written by infants,1,17 January 2018,"Even though I enjoy watching evildoers die, the action needs to make sense. With the exception to the 1st, the rest of the series is juvenile and very cheaply imagined. They replace plausibility with action scenes and gore. This one is no different the other sequels and is just as bad. For example, we have this incredibly engineered trap which could have been defeated easily in many ways, but all of the captured victims simply didnt behave like humans and so they they didnt beat the traps. For example, if you are chained and you see an electric saw, whats the 1st thing you try to do? Cut the chain right? No one even tried. Instead they tugged on the thick chain hoping to break it with their bare hands.If you are being hung and you have your hands free, whats the 1st thing you do? Obviously, you pull yourself up to relieve the stress on your neck. Not a single one of the people did this. Instead, they all tugged on their thick metal collar trying to tear it open with their hands. They could have easily pulled themselves up if they wanted (no overweight folks in this one).If you see a lever that you are supposed to pull, which is surrounded by cutting wire, and you have a chain to play with, do you A) stick your hand in the dangerous area like a retard to pull the lever or B) use the chain (or anything else like clothing) to try and latch onto and pull the lever?

108,danielharden,The Unwanted Phoenix,5,29 October 2017,"In 2004, Australian filmmaking duo, James Wan and Leigh Whannell, made their debut with Saw. The original Saw is a psychological thriller about two men, chained to opposite ends of a room and who have to discover why the infamous serial killer known as Jigsaw, put them there. The film made waves, spawning the most successful horror franchise of all time and bringing the torture porn horror sub genre to the mainstream. After having released a Saw film every Halloween for 7 years straight, the series finally ended in 2010 with Saw the Final Chapter Apparently, that film wasn't final enough, because 7 years later comes the release of Saw 8, better known as Jigsaw. Lionsgate is back to try and claim the Halloween slot once again and revitalise the torture porn sub genre. But the question is, does torture porn need reviving? The answer is no. It absolutely does not.Jigsaw was everything I've come to expect from a Saw sequel; The plot and story are ridiculously complex and self-righteous, but ultimately comes off as nihilistic and dumb due to the vast number of plot holes. The characters are one dimensional, archetypal assholes who lack logical reasoning. The traps are parodies of themselves and there are flashbacks galore. There isn't much ground to cover in the regard of flaws, that hasn't yet been covered in a previous film, and so Jigsaw just comes off as utterly pointless But we knew that anyway. They still can't seem to pay Cary Elwes' acting fee, so this film doesn't pick up where Final Chapter ended. A wise choice, but one that disconnects Jigsaw from the ongoing narrative of the Saw series, making Jigsaw stand out as nothing more than a business decision. It is clear as day that Jigsaw is nothing more than businessmen trying to shoehorn another Saw film in, so they can line their pockets.This all being said, I do have to give the film some credit. Jigsaw is the best looking Saw movie by far. You can really tell that Lionsgate invested some serious money into this film, as the visuals look incredibly professional, away from the B movie feel of the rest of the franchise, and gone too is the jarring editing that littered this franchise. Also, Jigsaw is more restraint than most Saw sequels, sure it's a gory film, but it does refrain from showing some moments in explicit detail. Some could say this is the films nostalgic nod to the original film similar to the films closing shot, but nonetheless, I appreciate that there is a level of restraint on display. As well as this, the director's attempt to create a sense of tension and high pressure, and to be honest, they did a decent job in certain moments. There are a number of almost Hitchcockian references in Jigsaw, that being when characters have to reach for something just out of their grasp. I found this to be rather effective and as a whole, this film is directed very well. Director's Michael and Peter Spierig really want to make the best movie possible in this contractual agreement film they find themselves in and stylistically they did a commendable job. Long story short, Jigsaw is as pointless as you'd think, however, there is an attempt being made by the directors to make lemonade out of lemons, and I have to respect that. The film is as muddled and philosophically pretentious as ever, but every flaw in Jigsaw has been around since the beginning and thus has become expected. There isn't much to really say about Jigsaw other than this time, I hope John Kramer and the Saw franchise remain dead for good.",Jigsaw
109,rabbitmoon,Absolute trash,1,10 January 2018,"There are so many points during Jigsaw where your mind wanders. You start thinking of better traps. Of why Hollywood can't generate enough original ideas lately. How a prequel to Saw would have been a better idea than a poor excuse for 'Saw 8' after already having 'the final chapter'. Of when and where morticians were able to source flesh/bone/metal cutting lasers that cut instantly at 4 or so meters. How some assistant is able to get 16 of these things, as well as afford all the other traps. The rampant coincidences, contrivances. How the character motives make so sense, and how more efficiently their goals could have been met. How the characters decisions and personalities resemble no one you've ever met in your life. How it all takes place in some weird parallel universe where its all surreal and sparse, huge buildings of traps go unnoticed, traps always work out exactly as intended regardless of how elaborate they are, requiring people to pull on dictaphones and do everything at the right time. Its just absolutely, insanely, trash. That this was directed by the guys who made Predestination and Daybreakers is alarming.",Jigsaw
110,BeanieCore,Dull & pointless.,5,6 May 2021,"It was inevitable that a franchise as profitable as ""Saw"" would eventually resurface again. Whether that be through a sequel, a reboot or a remake, we all knew it was bound to happen eventually. 7 years after ""Saw 3D"" was supposed to end the series, we were given ""Jigsaw"". And while the marketing kept folks guessing as to whether or not it would be a reboot or remake, it quickly becomes clear that this is simply yet another sequel, in fact, almost a prequel, to the original films. Sadly, after 7 years, I can't say it was worth the wait. This might not be the worst film in the franchise, but it's certainly one of the weakest, and just a downright strange film to begin with.I had hopes, mostly thanks to the direction of The Spierig Brothers. The Australian duo have an unconventional style that has spawned inventive and underrated genre cult-classics such as ""Daybreakers"" and ""Predestination"", so I was hoping that they could inject new life into an exhausted franchise. Instead, this turns out to be a rather routine Saw flick when all is said and done. The problem is, it tries it's hardest to convince you it won't be. The film has a much more polished, big-budget look than it's indie predecessors. And while the cinematography is handsome, the lack of the series' signature look leaves it feeling like it's just not a ""Saw"" film. Furthermore, the narrative is incredibly predictable and frankly, quite boring. The film's ""game"" is incredibly simplistic, and though there's a reason for this, that reason just doesn't sit right. Half of the film functions as a present-day sequel, while the twist is, that the ""game"" takes place before the first ""Saw"" film itself. This truly adds nothing to the plot, especially because the present-day storyline never interacts with or affects the past one in any meaningful way. It all feels so pointless.The traps are mostly un-inventive and rudimentary, and the characters themselves are either unappealing or simply boring. The detective characters are even more faceless, and one has trouble even keeping their names or relations to each other straight. At many intervals, the film just seems to drag along. There are a couple of slightly memorable moments, such as the ""cyclone"" and ""laser collar"" traps, but everything else is squarely mediocre. The most glaring fault is how inconsequential the entire film is. It adds nothing to the mythos nor does it do anything to advance the series. It's completely insignificant.",Jigsaw
111,edwardrevans,It's good to see it's back,6,29 October 2017,Now I enjoyed this new SAW outing but it does have problems in the plot and continuity problems. My issue her is that we have fresh bodies turning up years after they initially perished or did i get this wrong ?Kramer is back in the final act and seems to contradict the whole idea of what made him Jigsaw in the first place. Now I love the SAW movies so I am very willing to overlook these problems and on the whole enjoyed JIGSAW.,Jigsaw

The stories keep getting worse with each new addition, and resemble a telenovela instead of a horror movie.The kills are boring but still gory, but one can get that in the news too, for free. The real horror is that people keep feeding this franchise money, which will then go on indefinitely.I hope they just end it after this and invest all that planned cash in better ideas by younger and more innovative writers, because the directing and acting is decent, but the stories are too dumb and I don't care. 1-3 was exciting, and this is just bland.

113,punisherversion1,Jigsaw has returned well sort of.,6,13 January 2018,"Jigsaw: Directed by The Spierig Brothers and written by Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg.Here we are back to this well again. The eighth film in the series after what was sure to be the final film. I am a fan of the character of Jigsaw. I find the idea of this cult growing around this man who tortures people into finding a better version of themselves. The idealogy is sadly one of the things not really focused much on in this series. The gore and the insane traps are the focus most of the time. It became too much and too over the top. It had gotten to the point where you could not top yourself anymore without going into a territory that you can never come back from. This movie seems like a bit of reset so to speak. It is shot way different than before. It has a clean, crisp look to it bringing it out of the grungy bathroom that it had resided in before. I'm not sure it's better but I applaud them for wanting this film to at least look different from the previous installments. They take it out of the Disneyland sized warehouse kingdom from the original series and move it into a farmhouse. Once you learn what is happening in the end, you'll understand why. The editing was smooth and The Spierig brothers brought a completely different yet familiar feel to the series. I loved their previous movie before this one Predestination so I was genuinely curious to see how they would bring this one to life. This does hit on a check list for Saw movies. It features the traps and the cutting back and forth between a game and the detectives trying to stop everything. It has the requisite twist ending much like the original did. It feels more in tune spiritually with the original film. It works well within the framework. I know a lot of people were hoping they expanded on what they left open at the end of The Final Chapter myself included. They don't which is why it feels like a reset. It's a middle of the road movie. It's fine in what it attempts to do. It is bound to disappoint if you're expecting more of the same. The twist is not surprising. It's fine. I can't say I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't already a diehard Jigsaw fan and even then I'm not sure. I give this film a C.",Jigsaw

If I am not mistaken, Jigsaw is the 8th Saw movies, since the 1st when I was still in high school. The center of this story is just the same, the old man, even I forgot the name, but his face is really amazing as a real psycho: no expression, no smile, and clear sentences. Well, for Jigsaw the plot is not so surprise because it is connected with previous Saws, but the ending is really sadistic, that makes me remember about Squid. Okay, that's enough. If not, I will be a spoiler. Enjoy Jigsaw with your friends!!",Jigsaw
120,Amthermandes,"A SOLID throwback to its roots, which made the series popular in the first place",9,9 September 2021,"At the time I'm writing this review, the average IMDB rating of this film is 5.8. Which has me wondering if this film is yet one of the many cinematic victims targeted by malicious haters with multiple fake accounts, or if I'm one of the few honest fans who truly LOVED this movie. The 5.8 rating is skewed, full of negative bias, and extremely misleading.Going back to its original roots, the film pulls the audience in by two main story arcs, as is the common theme shared by all previous installments: One from the viewpoint of the victims trapped in a gauntlet of puzzles and vicious traps, and the other from the perspective of those on the outside of Jigsaw's games, attempting the arduous and frustrating process to solve the mystery ahead of them. Like the riddles that lie before the latter, gory thrills and surprises lie before the viewers of this much anticipated sequel to the popular Saw series. Unlike the previous 6 or 7 installments, this film doesn't use gore and shock value as its primary selling point, despite the fact that is should satisfy the cravings of the gore fanatic. It can be considered the 2nd least gory installment of the series (save possibly the latest installment, ""Spiral,"" as I haven't yet seen it at this point). It focuses more on backstory and character development, which is a refreshing break from the usual ""torture porn"" grind.One of the reasons I can attest that it's good, is that my wife, who is not a fan of horror movies of the more brutal, gory, and shocking nature, actually sat down 20 minutes into the film and not only powered through it, but was genuinely INTERESTED, which resulted in a budding interest in the series as a whole that I never thought I would EVER witness. Trust me folks, if she liked it, ANYBODY who is a fan of horror in the slightest could enjoy it as well. And it's almost a guarantee that anybody who considers themselves a fan of the series will enjoy it as well. And if they claim they don't, I challenge them to watch it again in a different mindset, because they obviously missed out on something great.",Jigsaw

The first one was great, and so was the one that preceded this very movie. In a perfect world they would've just ended it there. The greatest movies that I've seen end just like a well-written book; with unanswered questions (so that they'll stay in our mind, long after we've consumed/watched them). That's where this movie went wrong. Instead of concluding the franchise with a little bit of mystery they'll turn this into a quick cash-grab. I can already foresee a seemingly endless deluge of sequels. I mean, they've already gone this far. It's not like they'll just come to their senses all the sudden.",Jigsaw

He doesn't even look or act like an autopsy worker. Anyways. How about the new aspect ratio? Did we even need a new aspect ratio? I mean, why? If we have a new SAW movie, it should be full screen just like the previous ones. That new aspect ratio almost completely took me out of the movie. I couldn't get used to it in a SAW movie, sorry.. And I have to say that JIGSAW is the least movie that carries the roots of this franchise and on the top of that, we have the most untalented and forgettable characters here. I wonder how they got the job/role. Will I ever remember them? Nah. Did I ever feel sorry for them dying? Struggling? Hell! NO!

Nothing special about the acting, but it's a step up from what the franchise usually gives. Great plot, lots of suspense and a crazy twist. Just as suprising and the ending to the first film if not more so. Not that the other films were bad, but they were good for one thing, gore.

Just because a film is outlandish doesn't mean it has to be stupid but 'Jigsaw' never shows any intelligence whatsoever. The boxes people expect from this movie series are ticked: People die, there are puzzles and at the end there is ridiculously convoluted twist. But nothing is ever done with any real flair.One thing that stuck with me was when at one point a character mentions another character had fought the Taliban in Iraq despite them being from another country and another war. I can imagine how one person, the writer, could be ignorant enough not to know this was wrong but I can't fathom how no-one in the cast and crew who heard it delivered, no-one in post-production and no-one who saw the finished cut before release thought to mention this needed fixing/editing out.

There's nothing to get you excited, nothing that leaves you wanting more, it's just a highly predictable, seen it all before, Saw film under a different name, well I say different, just stick Jig before Saw and there you have it, pretty lazy and unoriginal. The characters are unconvincing and annoying, when they're in the traditional life and death situation, you're actually hoping for their death, make things more spicy and interesting.Nothing more than a limp B-movie (like most of the Saw films were), leave your expectations low so they don't get shattered going into the film.",Jigsaw

128,johnplocar,Picks up right where the series left off...in how ridiculous it is.,4,31 October 2017,"Do not expect a remake, reboot, or re-imagining of any sort. ""Jigsaw"" is exactly what the rest of the series after the third installment has been; complete and utter ridiculousness for 90 minutes. For better or worse, this does not change much of anything in terms of the ""Saw"" spirit. This includes all of the over-the-top acting and gore shows, the intricate contraptions and puzzles that take account the one in a million precise placement of all its victims, Tobin Bell with his creepy voice, and a story that makes no sense with an absurd twist right at the end. And I personally had a blast with this sufficiently stupid movie.The premise is more or less the same as all of the others in the series; one plot line follows a select few detectives investigating what schemes the Jigsaw killer is up to while the other revolves around a small group of characters being terrorized by a maze full of deadly puzzles and traps set up by Jigsaw. Simple enough in premise as always, but the story line is never simply a straight line with the ""Saw"" movies. Constantly being thrown curve ball after curve ball whether it makes sense or not, yet somehow that is all part of the fun, even when it may become frustrating.From frame one it is very apparent that the film knows what it is and couldn't be happier to bring back the franchise. In the film's writing throughout there was always just something about it that felt delighted for the return of ""Saw"". Truth be told I haven't been the biggest fan of the series, but I will say that there is an odd charm to it and for one reason or another I remained interested to see where it went next; even though they progressively got worse in my opinion. Comparing this to the rest of the previous installments is certainly difficult for myself because objectively speaking ""Jigsaw"" is probably worse than the majority of the ""Saw"" movies, but subjectively speaking I probably had the most fun watching this totally ludicrous sequel.The characters are nothing more than chunks of meat waiting to die in one gruesome fashion or another of course, at this point with these films I wouldn't expect anything else. The cinematography and editing is actually different from the other ones. Aesthetically speaking with the camera work, this honestly doesn't resemble anything before it. I'm not entirely sure if that's a good or a bad thing. I've never really liked the look of the ""Saw"" movies with the quick cuts, bright flashes or that fast-forward vision while all taking place with 'dungeon' lighting. Although this movie looks borderline television quality, not necessarily bad looking but not exactly theater worthy either. Do I recommend ""Jigsaw""? Sure. If you've seen all seven of the others then why stop now. If you think this one should be taken seriously though, you're out of your mind or you will be immediately after seeing this because this is total nonsense. Be warned now, you start trying to use your brain on this one I promise you that it will be mush by the time the credits hit...the opening credits. So I suggest to those who plan on seeing ""Jigsaw"" should just sit back and let the movie happen, you may have a good time with it that way. At least that's how I did. So take that for what it's worth. Is it good? God no. Is it stupidly entertaining? Hell yes. But that's kind of ""Saw"" in a nutshell.",Jigsaw
129,Ingrouille181,"Not really the sequel we wanted, but, we've got one at least, I guess.",5,18 November 2017,"I've wanted to see where the next Saw movie would take us, would it take place soon after the seventh film, or would it take the route this movie did; this one.Alright what's the story. Ten years after the death of Jigsaw, the world is shocked when several people show up dead, all apparently the victims of a new killing spree led by Jigsaw. It's up to detectives and so and so (didn't really care) to find out if Jigsaw is in deed alive and stop these games before it's too late, I guess.OK, so, the best thing about the film is the twist, cause if you have a saw film you've gotta have a twist. Ready?It turns out that the bodies the detectives find are actually recreations of people who died in a jigsaw game OVER TEN YEARS AGO, before the first Saw movie. John Cramer is still dead, there's just another killer on the loose, or at least I believe he's gonna continue the Jigsaw legacy from now on through the next dozen sequels. He's the leading 'forensic pathologist' (mouthfull) who's helping the detectives solve the case, but ends up being behind the deaths. All the while all of the traps we see in the film are simply a collective flashback, and all of the bodies found in the present were people killed in the same way as the previous victims. And get this, the original victims of these traps, before the events of the first Saw, we're never even found in the first place.Thank you Adam of YMS for making this point loud and clear, but this is so dumb. The entire ending to this film is that Logan the forensic pathologist was baiting the lead detective into the trap at the end out of revenge for releasing his wife's killer, as well as framing him for the murders that happen in the present day events.But if none of the original bodies were found to begin and are still rotting in the barn they died in, which turns out to be a barn owned by Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's x-wife, why did Logan decide to recreate the murders for a crime that hasn't been discovered for 10 years now then? The YMS review of this explains it much better and in much better detail than I ever could, but that point alone makes this movie incredibly ridiculous. We have a repeat of Saw 5 as we get 5 people put into one of Jigsaw's traps, one steals a purse that contained a woman's medication, leading her to die. One sold a bike to Jigsaw's nephew that had faulty breaks, causing him to get run over, one smothered her own baby and framed her husband for the murder, and one got his friend killed in car crash and lied to authorities about it. The first one to supposedly die we don't even see his face, only for it to turn out it was Logan. My question is, like YMS points out, why did he even kill someone to act as the body of himself when he didn't even die to begin with. The Saw movies try to stay somewhat realistic despite all the ridiculous odds Jigsaw plays and the contradictions with the time line, but things like this are just used to trick the audience; can this new Jigsaw break the 4th wall or something?And if Logan's trying to frame a guy for murder, why kill him through the use of a jigsaw trap; be pretty weird for a guy who supposedly committed jigsaw style murders to die through the use of one. And if authorities end up finding his body they'll also end up finding the victims of jigsaw's first full fledged trap ten years ago. they'd probably piece it together that he was framed.The Saw movies are convoluted as they are, but this movie is even more ridiculous. And I would have rather had doctor Gordon, or maybe some other victim of Jigsaw's trap, pick up the mantle, not Logan.Anyway, I saw it, it was fine. Traps were nothing new, the acting, directing were both OK, and the ending was cheap. But, if Saw's 9, 10, 11 etc come out, I'll definitely go see them.6 out of 10",Jigsaw

After seeing Jigsaw, it was enough solid and interesting, but I just had some feeling that they made a needless story because it wasn't so important for fans of Saw franchise. Everything about this was just really solid, and the twist was good one. The games/traps are not as strong/brutal as from previous Saw movies, but still made me interesting what will happen next.

The movie has 2 plots, one showing 5 victims needing to survive to the dangerous games of Jigsaw and other telling us the story about a police department investigating some stranger homicides.The plot about the surviving group is nice, there are some creative traps, however there's less violence and bloody scenes than in the previous entries and also has some plot holes, for example Jigsaw seems to know who would survive since the beginning. During the middle of the movie I was wondering ""how's possible Jigsaw recorded a tape with the name of that character? How he knows that character is alive? He could die during the beginning of the game"". Meanwhile, the plot about the polices gives us some great twists and I'm sure you won't see them coming.Jigsaw is a sequel with some reboot elements, doesn't change the horror genre, but is funny and I suggest it for who wants to turn off the brain for 90 minutes and just enjoy a nice movie.

137,jerralagbayani,A Twist With No Jig and a well(not good)comeback to the series.,6,28 October 2017,"There will be spoilers in the last paragraph.When I saw the first trailer I was stoked on seeing it first. Now that I've seen it,it brought some pretty disappointing moments where I wanted the series to be changed.First off I wanted to see more unanswered plot holes from Saw The Final Chapter like why some people were involved and stuff. Second, I thought they would be adding more modern technology in the mix. Third, I expected a whole new feeling to the film that was different from the others. Finally fourth, I wanted Waaaay more mystery and drama.Although this film didn't meet my expectations it's still ranking 3 out of all the saw movies. There was nothing new and if they are to make a sequel they better add something new to the series. I gave it a 6/10 for it's come back to the series, it's new traps, and it's twist I SAW coming. We need a new Jig from the series c'mon!!SPOILER! I easily saw 2/3rds of the plot coming when they first mentioned the spiral trap and the rumor he used it before every other one of his victims. Also I knew it was that dude who faked him dying by the lasers because we've seen it before in Saw 1, also because they found skin sampled in his freezer. Ultimately the twist was pretty easy to see.

The showrunner claims to sit above vengeance, yet some of his targets have a curious proximity to him.Admirers of this engineer's work eagerly await his resurrection.

This crusade of truth has a slim chance of reaching justification. In fact, this installment throws all hints of honorable killing away in exchange for a truly hilarious and nonsensical reveal.When a series has self-mutilated itself for as long as the Saw franchise has, one must wonder if a meta-narrative is hiding there.

139,k-dhesi,They missed the mark with this one,3,24 November 2019,"Now I haven't done a review since I was a teen. But I just finished watching 'JIGSAW' and I felt overly compelled to share my two cents - speaking of which, 2 cents may have been the budget for this film - moreover, 2 cents is what the writers, director and producers deserve for grinding the already over saturated Saw series into complete dust.In my opinion, the John Kramer aka Jigsaw story should have ended at Saw III - which was awesome despite what most fans of the series say.Saw IV - Saw VIII (3D) were not quite up to par as the first three films, but they held up well by continuing on right where the previous film left off and giving the audience great insight to John Kramer's life - why he became the jigsaw killer, and how he accomplished most of his 'traps' in the first three films.Now, there is a hundred and one plots the writers could've chose revitalizing the series with this installment after a seven year gap. Why they went with the story they did is beyond me. I'm honestly shocked it got the green light, this film borderline tarnishes the reputation of the Jigsaw character that the original Saw films created.I won't spoil it for anyone but if you're expecting to find out more about John Kramer's life - this film does not do that. To be honest, I'm not sure what it was trying to do. The ending leaves you really dissatisfied and instead of filling the holes for questions the previous films may have raised, this film just raises a thousand more.I too did not want another saw film carrying on from the final events in Saw III, after all, we had four films after that jumping back n forth from Saw I to whichever sequel you were watching - all in a continuous timeline ( I think). But I sure as hell would prefer a sloppy attempt by the old cast seven years later over this half hearted attempt.Why not go with whole copycat plot? Why not have one of Jigsaw's survivors take over his legacy without being a former 'apprentice'. Why not have one of the Jigsaw's victims family member as the new Jigsaw taking vengeance on Kramer's family and associates. So many ideas, so many way this 'reboot' could've been amazing but nooooooooooo.The 'game' being played had hardly any context to it, or at least not enough to make you invested in the victims. The victims (I guess the main characters in the film) were extremely one dimensional and you learnt nothing about them. In fact, they barely even played a game. And this was the A plot of the film! There was no thought out traps, a lot of occurrences relied on luck and not careful planning. The game sort of ended extremely quickly and took a sudden u turn - it seemed like they left out half of 'the game' to keep true to the 90 minute run-time, so they suddenly just did the 'let's just have a pig mask stab them and have them wake up somewhere else.' And the twist completely made this entire game pointless and their victims even more pointless.The B plot pacing was horrible, it was hard to keep up with what's going on with most scenes being shot in a coroners lab. The 'detectives' too were extremely futile.The writers of this film again closed the film off by connecting the previous films - a very stupid idea because it failed miserably doing so. And instead of going 'ohhh dammnnnn' like the original saw films had you saying after the twist reveal, you went 'what the... wait that makes no sense'.The one salvation this unique horror franchise has that no other film can compete with is it's 'trap -game torture' scenes. There are many people who watch Saw just to see victims gets torn apart in unimaginable ways.This film does not even deliver there, in fact the traps are so bad I'm not even sure they could be called 'traps', most of them were games involving more then two people and they lacked all the creativity - there is no gut bursting, spline rippling traps at all. The gore is heavily toned down for this film. There is no suspense if the victims will survive the traps. There is no quick shots of epileptic madness. There is no sixty second time limit to complete the test. There is no 'protagonist' going through trials and tribulations in one of Jigsaw's twisted games. There is no 'live or die, make your choice'. 'There is no game over'.
There's certainly not one memorable trap from the movie.I'm never critical on actors - but by god the performances were terrible, although they had a horrible script to work with so they can't take all blame.There is a not a single character that makes any mark on the series, aside from the character Eleanor Bonneville, her story seemed interesting and looked as if it was going somewhere but alas it did not - instead the film scratches at the surface of her interesting personal life which doesn't lead anywhere in the end.'Jigsaw' feels like a small studio trying to replicate the Saw series without trying to get sued for copying the originals. Though, there's nothing original about it - still they failed to capture the dark essence of one of the most epic horror villains of all time - Jigsaw.The movie never felt like it was Jigsaw game being played. It felt like it was a psychopathic junkie copycat who's trying to replicate what his idol did ten years ago.If you thought the opening trap in SAW 3D (2010) didn't make any sense, just wait until you see how ridiculously far they take the series seven years later. They missed the mark heavy with this one.My personal Saw ranking: SAW 1, SAW 3, SAW 2, SAW 5, SAW 6, SAW 4, SAW 7 (3D), JIGSAW",Jigsaw

This newest entry is given a new spark by the Spierig brothers, whose awesome last film predestination probably should have gotten them a better project than this. They still deliver a tonne of style and energy (and better looking production value) then the last few movies and still leave their mark on a franchise that could have easily have stayed as dead as Jigsaw's victims. The story itself was relatively intriguing and the trap scenes are technically superb, and disgusting. You won't be quoting lines of dialogue after seeing it but the visceral imagery is nonetheless impressive and effective. A movie that didn't need to exist but is better than it deserves to be, and I'll take that.",Jigsaw

145,neobateman,"saw this, saw that, saw everything",3,17 November 2017,"I was never a huge fan of the Saw series. I enjoyed the first one which I thought personally was a pretty excellent horror movie. However after the first film, which did have a nice theme about life, the Saw films became more and more gore over substance. In the sequels the only major factor for these films to exist were the violent traps. We had the alleged Final Chapter in 2010, but when there is a chance for the franchise to make money again, I guess it wasn't. This installment I will say is the best Saw sequel we have had up to this point (which really doesn't say much). Years after the events of the previous chapter, the Jigsaw killer has returned. However is it John Kramer or not? This is the question that the main characters of the film try to answer. However the plot is so uninteresting but also confusing, especially when keeping in mind the other chapters. I will say though continuity has never been a strength of the Saw films. The characterizations were also unimaginative, and had nothing to say. They weren't even interesting. So we have a murder mystery without a compelling story, uninteresting characters and no interesting ideas. The film doesn't even have the luxury of offering any scares. Yea sure there were the easy jump scares, but I was never shivering when seeing this. The traps are also not that gruesome, so even in that category it fails. The only thing I will say about this film is that everyone is trying. The direction is somewhat competent, all the actors are trying (some work, some don't) and they try to take Saw back to the roots of the original.",Jigsaw

As for the movie itself, if you liked the previous seven entries, I guess there's no reason you won't like this one (seriously, what's wrong with you??). The death traps are creative and gory as ever, the characters as one dimensional as any character post Saw 3 and the twists...well actually I called them in advance to the poor girl I dragged with me, proving that once you've figured out the Saw formula, it really becomes harder to be surprised by them. All and all, the last Saw movie that was legitimately decent was Saw 5 and after that, the quality rapidly declined with both Saws 6 and 7, I guess the hope was that with a seven-year break to think about this one that they might turn things around, but no, this is the worse the series has yet had to offer.

It has all those elements of madness and violence that a psycho movie has. But still whatever may be the genre it is undoubtedly an excellent movie to watch. One of the best in 2017. When i first saw it in the upcoming movie list it attracted me with the name. Then i have waited for it to release and finally after a long waiting i have the opportunity to see the film. And truly after so many expectation the movie is quite capable of fulfil those. Always expected movies are not good and sometimes they really fail to hold the audience , their expectation. But this one is exceptional.The movie is about a man named Jigsaw who has been dead for ten years. But soon he comes to the light as a murderer as many bodies are found all over the town. The mystery around the death of jigsaw and also the causes of mass death is the main attraction of the movie. It leads the movie to a breath taking climax full of action and surprise. You can not predict the ending and this is the beauty of watching it.Apart from all of its excellent aspect the movie has some limitations also. It is full of some violent and bloody killing scene...Many audience specially female may find it intolerable and nasty. The director has tried to give it a horror flavour but failed to elicite it. This movie has no need to be a horror movie . ..It is a thriller movie..so they should have avoided this horror try.From all these discussion we can come to a decision that Jigsaw is another success of 2017...",Jigsaw

It's the person you wanted to see die the most, yet he walks out A-OKAY. These Saw movies have a knack for doing that! The gore in this movie is INCREDIBLE and features downright the BEST gore moment of the entire Saw franchise, where a guy's head is split down the middle like an apple slicer. It had me cheering, because it is not only the best gore moment in the entire Saw franchise but one of the best gory moments I've ever seen in theaters!

When the trailer came out, i was disappointed that they had done away the gritty look of the previous SAW films and are bringing a new cleaner visual style that felt a little less scary but after watching the film, i have to say, the visual style is a breathe of fresh air and a nice change upAnother good thing is that the film focuses less on the torture porn aspect and instead it focuses more on solving the puzzle aspect of the traps. They have toned down the violence, but i'm okay with that because they did focus on making the traps more of a challenge instead of a torture. But if we talk about the traps, yes there were a very few maybe one or two original and innovative traps but the rest were very uninspired and a less gore-y versions of some traps from previous SAW films The film does have a cool and unexpected turn of events. There's an interesting mystery going on and an intriguing ""whodunnit"" story line that keeps you guessingLet's get down to negativesI know that the directors of this film, Spierig brothers are good at their jobs and they know how to make a film and i really liked their previous film that was Predestination but here, even though they showed that they understood the basis and core aspects of SAW franchise, they could not manage to deliver anything too impressive or anything we haven't seen before except the overall change of tone and visual styleThe writing is mediocre, but like i said it does have some cool twists that you may not see coming, it still is very clichéd and mediocre. Like always, there is excessive use of flashbacks to tell many parts of the story, which may not be a negative but excessive use is excessive and can be considered lazy at timesI've seen critics mentioning the cringe-y acting and i agree that in many scenes, some acting is very over the top and a bit cringe-y Wrapping up the review, i would say, Jigsaw is not as good as it could have been but its not the worst of the franchise. In fact, it may be like the 4th or 5th best film in the SAW series if i had to rank them in terms of quality I do appreciate that Jigsaw combines some of the best ideas of some SAW films and delivers some good moments but it barely does anything to justify its existence beyond making more money for the franchiseIf you like most of the SAW films, you may enjoy this one too. Even if you only like the first few SAW films, i would say give this a chance if you want to, you may end up liking it.

Loved the detective/crime story as usual and FOR ONCE I wasn't subjected to just gory nonsense. It's a bit gruesome and grisly due to the morgue photos and dead bodies - oh yes there was blood - but they saved the big gore till the end as a payoff. Loved it up until the end where it all falls apart. The ending itself was stupid. I would have laughed at the killers final line (it's so PATHETIC compared to saw 1's 'game over') but I was sitting there with jaw on the floor from how BAD the ending was. Ruined everything. I even forgave the lapses in logic cuz it's saw and when saw is good - it's fun. I thought the traps were well done and the silo trap was the best since maybe the shotgun tilt a whirl of 6. Too many things unanswered, some missing characters...SPOILERSI thought the main chick was gonna be Jeff's daughter - and she wasn't so I was really upset about that lol When the killer is revealed I was dumbfounded... I liked the cast a lot and thought it was well written on the whole but just all comes apart at the reveal. Tobin's scene was great - the highlight of the movie. I guessed that the game had already happened - seemed obvious right?What happened to Ella(?) and what happened to one leg guy? I thought tobin was dr. gordon at first - then I remembered it already happened - but where is he? Where's Hoffman? I loved the cancer diagnosis angle - that was great but I was really hoping we'd find out her last name was Denlan. I ended my fan edit of all films in one long ass movie with the ""don't trust the one who saves you' part... I really thought that was where they were gonna go - with Jeff's daughter...oh well.END OF SPOILERSIn the end they got a lot right but the wrong ruined what was the best one (maybe 3rd best) after the original. Really disappointed and I have no idea how to include it my fan edit cuz it almost seems insulting to put it in cuz it has nothing to do with series almost. A real WASTE of a good ride.I think the blade on this saw has finally dulled - this new direction just seems like it will ruin the original series. That's what's SO maddening about this movie - I loved it until the end. It was MORE than making up for the unwatchable POS that was 7. So can I say watch it? Yeah but it will disappoint you but the ride is worthy enough if we still had videos stores. ""Watch when it comes on TV"" is vague and it sounds stupid. Wait for it on video was always an easy good review lolI'd rank the films from best to last - Saw (4 stars - a classic in it's own way) Saw VI (4 stars - great sequel) SaW IV (3 1/2 stars. Best twist in the series. best misdirection) Saw III (3 1/2 stars - it's just SO bloody and mean and nasty. A real mean spirited movie) Saw II (3 stars - good sequel. still fun)Saw V (**1/2) I like it but only works as a piece and not it's own movie) Jigsaw (** stars) Almost best since original - terrible ending) Saw VII - utter trash.

167,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,"For better or worse, this is the 'Jurassic World' of the Saw franchise",6,27 October 2017,"From 2004 to 2010, we were greeted with a Saw film once every Halloween. Each film built on the foundation of the previous film, literally deeming them as iterations of one another. Now that time has past between films and new films and ideas have come out since then in the torture porn genre (I hate using that phrase, especially to describe the first film), new ground had to be broken. There are die- hard Saw fans like myself who know most every little intricacy of the first seven films, but nobody cares about the old formula anymore. It tired itself out. Instead of reiterating, it was now time to innovate. Enter co-writers Josh Stolberg & Pete Goldfinger and co-directors Michael & Peter Spierig, and in Halloween of 2017 you get Jigsaw.All of this follows an eerily similar path to the Jurassic Park franchise. JP had sequels that, while in-name they hold their own, after a while started turn away some moviegoers and even got close to jumping the shark if it continued down the beaten path. So they created some space between themselves for some years, and came back with a re-branding. Both films (Jigsaw and Jurassic World) serve as standalone films if you so want to treat them as such or jump into them anew, play off their respective first films in terms of content and paying proper homage, modernize themselves and play more to a general casual audience (Jigsaw domestically, JW globally), can and probably will churn out its own set of sequels, and let veterans of the franchises appreciate the small bits that played off any one of the previous installments. Jurassic World lives in a PG-13 setting though and caved in to more Hollywood tropes (including CGI), plus is a much higher budget film, but Jigsaw still breaks a lot of new ground that will not play familiarly to the Saw films of old.When Darren Lynn Bousman jumped on board to direct Saw II, he noted in the commentary track what some of the 'staples' were for the franchise, including quick-cuts. While I don't agree with that assessment, this continued for his next two films in the franchise, and directors David Hackl and Kevin Greutert followed up with a similar format. The films also found themselves in flashback haven, remained almost exclusively within interior settings, and centralized a set of characters to connect within a small universe. Jigsaw opens up to the feeling that this is taking place in a larger city and environment, letting characters in and out of the games explore more and be realer people (in that they do not just serve the purpose of the film alone, like they have lives outside of what we see). The framing of the film has changed, the color palette has widened, Charlie Clouser's score is not as in-your-face, and the production simply doesn't feel as cheap. Right steps were made in making this film much more accessible, and I see this continuing in the future.While Jurassic World actually seems to remove the sequels from canon (we will see if that's true with Jeff Goldblum's appearance in Fallen Kingdom), Jigsaw plays strongly in the sense that if you go without seeing, recalling, or keeping in mind Saw 4-7, you will be okay. Hoffman is completely out of the picture in Jigsaw, never once mentioned or concerned about. The only traits to be aware of in those films was that John lost a child, was once in a relationship with Jill Tuck, and there was an autopsy performed on his body. In fact, you could just as easily disregard specifics about Saw II and Saw III, and you will probably be okay. Knowing that John Kramer was killed in the third film just might be enough.This one really mostly plays off the first film to be most effective, though. Aside from the elaborateness of the traps and games being made (which could transition more smoothly seeing the other seven films first), we can leave the first film understanding that a cancer- stricken individual puts victims in life-or-death scenarios because of moral sins they have committed, and if killed get a puzzle piece cut out of their bodies. Seasoned individuals will also find some of the twists in the new film somewhat predictable simply because they know how Jigsaw thinks (or really, how the writers think). There were over a half-dozen twists, and I probably guessed or suspected the majority of them. Didn't make the film any inferior because I'm sitting and thinking about the casual moviegoer experiencing this film, and I think the best thing you can do for yourself now is at least see the first film and heck even at most know the outcome of the original trilogy. Saw IV, V, VI and The Final Chapter now all end up being fan-service flicks, unless any Jigsaw sequels end up coming back to them more than they have now. I liked this movie. It could've been a complete garbage escapade like the seventh film was, and it wasn't. This reignites the franchise after it had stalled out and breathes fresh air. Maybe we will get a couple more within the next few Halloweens, because there is something to explore but I don't know how they'll want to do it. It is up to their creative bones now, and I like that facet of it because they can make good films if they try their darnedest in doing so.If this film interests you enough that you want to give the first film a chance and haven't yet, go to Netflix right now to check it out, consider completing the original trilogy if you loved it enough to see what happens next, and check out this film when you're able to. I've reached my 1000-word limit, so now I'll just leave you here with my franchise ranking:1, 3, 6, 2, J, 5, 4, 7",Jigsaw

I think I made it to the 4th movie in the franchise and that was garbage. I skipped the next couple of movies because of it but I heard good things about this latest one. Not true, just as bad if not worse. To put it quite simply this is just the laziest writing ever for a horror movie (or any movie!). Its a major yawn fest and you just end up looking at the time throughout the movie waiting for it to be over. The story line is very simplistic. The characters are just awful (and the acting also). Lots of things don't really make sense. It's not so much that there are plot holes but more that there is no plot basically. You just scratch your head throughout the movie. Apart from the fact that there isn't a story, the worse thing is just the annoying characters making stupid decisions or not making them- over and over again. In the end you just want everyone to die. The true puzzle is how this movie ended up being made with that script!",Jigsaw

Not only they rehashed many ideas from the previous movies, but the final reveal was also done SEVERAL times in the previous saws.I won't go into details because of spoilers, but every time some plot twist happened in the movie I was like ""Wait, they already did that in Saw X"". In fact, I since I saw all the Saws (pun intended) I was able to correctly guess what the final reveal will be because like I said, they already done it before.And most of the traps were just plain dumb, some of them giving a lot of room for cheating, which broke the immersion for me, because the ""gamers"" were acting like idiots who for some reason switched their brains off and walked into them like sheep. Other traps required pretty much clairvoyance from the Jigsaw, because to set up them the way they went, he would have to see the fricking future. Early Saws used to be great, but this movie, and several previous ones, are just plain bad and the franchise needs to be put to rest at this point. And if the decide to make another one, just don't rehash the same stuff over and over and over again.",Jigsaw

How and why a website of your caliber, size and name and even supposedly value your website app doesn't support writing reviews directly through it yet!!!! They tell you on your support page that it's in the road map (to China!) of what to come!!!!!!!! Really!!!!!! Your app forces itself on any Android/Apple operated systems whenever the name Imdb is ever written immediately your app forces itself popup without question or option and once you reach the audacity of thinking to write a movie review easily and simply on your mobile device you are forced to face the ugly reality that would ultimately force you to uninstall the entire Free app to open Imdb from your mobile devices Internet brother and be very sure to have it on Desktop mode not mobile mode because even then the Web page won't have an option to write a review!!!!!!!! Honestly guys this seriously way beyond inconvenient this is plain stupid unfortunately!!!!! Anyways back to the movie on hand I consider myself one of the very best movie critics on the planet right now as I am a very strong opinionated human being who enjoys watching movies on daily basis I watch the very latest in the Cinema or online the moment it comes out and I have done my history check with flying colours from Gone with the Wind upto Jigsaw!! This movie has simply missed the mark due to unoriginality in the first place and the idea of a smart killer killing the very lamest of people in absolute gore and they are usually non heroic type characters and hence stars with no one ever being able to stop the Jigsaw and everyone falling exactly into the path he has drawn one part after the other is quite lame really and you need to know that people are smart enough out there to know and feel the weakness in the total repeatetivness this saga has become and supposedly ended in recent years so I was expecting much much more from the Jigsaw rather than the usual gore junk that doesn't twist heads anymore and if not done very smartly it will surely fall into oblivion and die which is what I see here extremely vividly!",Jigsaw

I have seen all the ""Saw"" movies but this was my first time seeing one during its first run, on the big screen. What surprised me most is that it was such unimpressive viewing. It's actually fairly dull. Even during the action sequences the film grinds along at one quite leisurely pace through a fairly unexceptional series of ""games"", alternating - often jarringly - with some clunky and embarrassing dialogue from the stereotypical ""investigators"" that would be unworthy of most TV movies. I have to say that there is some clever plotting designed to mislead us and one major reveal that had me applauding the writers. But they are a long time coming when you are watching a bunch of quite bland characters meet their fates with a distinct lack of tension about it. Finally, here as in all the other ""Saw"" movies either the on-set lighting or some post-production makes everything seem under-lit. I assume that is so the effects are harder to spot but it did get rather wearing to watch every scene through a grey mist. I don't think I shall be rushing back to the cinema for the next one, but no doubt I shall be tempted back at some point, if only to see what happens next!

NOTHING else deserves any praise whatsoever. It's tough to find something out of ""Hollywood"" as bad as this.

It's like each time they make a Saw movie, they torture the original series, 1-2-3. If
Leigh Whannell and/or James Wan won't return for the series, just don't make anymore sequels/reboots, please!

This one was spot on with the same cruel intentions that portrays no bad deeds shall ever go unpunished in the same ways.

We SAW it all. Background of every character, every trap and reasons behind it. Some of us were somehow attached to all those people (John, Jill, detective Hoffman, Amanda...even Lawrence Gordon). Hell, I was even attached to Adam! Anyhow, you give us a new movie, and you put into it an entirely new cast. We can only see John in couple of scenes, but that's it. 
I must say - when I saw John taking off his mask, I went nuts. My thoughts were: ""Oh come on! Seriously?! How the hell are you even alive? What kind of sorcery is this? Jeff slit your throat, they literally pulled out your brain in the morgue, and you are just standing here alive and well?! And why these two people are not surprised to see you?"" 
They showed us in the end that game being played took it's part 10 years ago, when John was alive. By one part I was relived, because they haven't brought Jigsaw back to life, and by other part I was disappointed, because they introduced us to yet another apprentice. This guy have NEVER been mentioned before. It wasn't mentioned, in all 7 movies, even the ""thing"" he did (mixing up x-rays).
I wasn't happy when I heard another movie is coming out (because, as I said before, we reached full circle with 7 movies), and I'm not happy after watching it. Whoever made it, just know this - you might just ruined an entire Saw franchise with this one. It was clearly a ""moneygrab"" movie.

If you are in this group of people.. you will probably not be too crazy about Jigsaw, though there is still some value here. The one thing that Jigsaw brings to the table is an overall ""what is going on?"" mystery that we haven't truly gotten since the original. I found the majority of this film to be tense and full of intrigue. The traps are interesting, the characters are more likable that we have seen in Saw 5-7 (stupid... but likable.)

When we learn that Hoffman is also an apprentice, THAT MAKES SENSE because there is manpower required to move and hang victims that a bed ridden Jigsaw and 80 pound Amanda couldn't have.This movie, introducing ANOTHER apprentice and giving ZERO reason why he's never mentioned in the SEVEN other movies is absolutely insane.

That is worth it in itself. Marvellous tune that.

On top of that they're all CGI, and not a good one. (Yes people, we are talking worst than the CG deaths from Saw 7). Also, they use futuristic gimmics and gadgets, let me put you in perspective: In this universe there are some whimsical flashy blue lasers that can cut flesh and bone in less than a second.

Otherwise I recommend watching it to Saw fans.

213,jullebull,Exciting thriller with some cool traps,5,5 May 2018,"Well to be the eitgth installement in a long runnin project this is kinda good! The way they build up a new world with new characters 10 years after Kramer's death, I like it. An I really like how they diceded to have a film based more on a good story, the outiside world and the investigation. It's not very much blood and gore as the latest films. The torture porn just crossed the limit, it wasn't even interesting - so thank you for not making this movie freaked out. 
I like the characters, the acting is okay, the story is good. A murder mystery where you can try to guess who the killer might be. It's a mystery and a thrilling movie. 
The traps are awsome. Big, brutal and high technical. But that also messes upp the timeline and a barn seems like the worst place ever to have a trial. 
But it's interesting to follow these characters. The ones in the trap and the ones in the procedural side. Of course the movie wasn't necessary, I didn't want another Saw-movie, it had some bad acting and editing. It messed up the timeline and left many questions unanswered. But I still like it. I like the characters, the story. 
The atmosphear and shooting style and even color palett is diifferent, that can be positive or negative. 
The film may not be the best but it got my attention and is worth a watch if you're a Saw fan. It was cool to see the aswome twists and the Spiereg Brothers as directors. Shame the writers turned it into a comedy though,but it's still entertainment and it deserves 6/10 :)
And I really hope this is the last one.",Jigsaw
214,CINEFILMSS,A new chapter? after the final chapter?,8,1 October 2020,"Although the last Saw film was titled 'the final chapter' we were given another saw film, this one titled slightly different 'Jigsaw'.The film had a lot of interesting details and scenes which would keep the audience hooked and wanting to find out more. Such as the start, i, for one wanted to know how the guy found out another game was starting and how his storyline would play out. It was interesting to find out how they played off the 'good guy' playing the bad guy (obviously for spoiler reasons i won't mention who).The planning and work gone into each scene and trap, not just designing and building but actually making each one look realistic and matching wounds to the trap would've been a lot of work and i praise them for that however, like some other people have mentioned, the acid was incorrectly detailed and to some, who know about Acid, this would stand out and ruin the film.During the film there is tons of easter eggs and foreshadowing of various traps to come and possibly some scenes for a later film maybe?The film keeps up with the 'saw franchise marketing' that being plenty of gore and a creepy as hell Puppet, reintroduced with new features. Alongside this puppet there is plenty of subtle hints at the actual killer, known as the copycat killer.So yeah, i would say this film is overly good and worth watching, especially if you enjoy the original saw films and a fan of the franchise.",Jigsaw

To start with the good, the production quality is a HUGE step up compared to the rest of the series. The final twist COULD have been good, if the main antagonist hadn't botched the famous ""Game Over"" line. And that's pretty much about it. The traps are bad, the characters are bad, Tobin Bell is underused, the plot is bad, the acting is even worse. Would not recommend this film at all.",Jigsaw

It is better than its siblings (Apart from the golden kid, The First Saw movie) but still lacking in many way.

220,jonathanbrown12,Like all the others,3,12 October 2018,"I was a big fan of the originals: the first one was ground breaking in the thriller/horror genre. The second one was a psychological wet dream: race against the clock, puzzle solving, plus plenty of horrifying traps and plenty of gore. And from there, they seemed to dip just ever so slightly each sequal made. Still, was a big fan...Then this lack luster of a horror film is produced; and, sad to say, it only disappointed. The victims were forgettable to the point that I honestly don't remember names or reasons they were even in the ""game"". The traps were less than scary (the most thrilling one was the silo where the blades start to fall). Then the ending was just too predictable. It felt rehashed over the first seven films: the death of the main guy (again don't even remember his name) only to find out it's faked in an attempt to cause admission of guilt from the other guy, then to watch him be killed in a gruesome, bloody manner. There just seemed to be nothing new about it.I can honestly say that this was just bad, I cannot see them making another, and I pray to everything holy, that they stop now. Please, let it be ""Game over"".",Jigsaw
221,SleepyMaya,By far less good than the other movies,10,3 December 2017,"I gave the movie 10 because I'm a huge Saw fan and I can't help by giving it the best score just for being a new Saw movie. :P Though I think the movie is by far less good than the original series, and it is VERY clear that it was not made by the same people. It feels like a nice script made by Saw fans rather than a real Saw movie by the original creators.Can't say it's a bad movie because it isn't and I did enjoy, but I couldn't help but being disappointed that the movie completely ignores the story line of the original series. The 7th Saw movie's ending had SO much potential, and I think it should have been obvious that the new Jigsaw movie will have to pick up where the last movie ended, but instead, 99% of the original story is not even mentioned. None of the original characters is being mentioned at all except for Jigsaw himself, and you literally don't need to know or remember anything from the original movies, except for who is Jigsaw and that fact that he died.I mean, where is the REAL person who continued Jigsaw's work at the end of the last movie? What happened to him? How could you completely ignore him?The traps and mini stories are also BY FAR less smart than the ones in the original series. Some of the traps and tests are even predictable! The one thing that the original movies weren't is predictable.The twist is... OK, not very impressive but at least it's nice.Gore is lacking, and even though I always thought the gore wasn't that important on the original series, now that it's lacking I finally understand how much it affected the experience when it was there.The good parts: It's a new Saw movie! With Tobin Bell and Billy The Puppet! That's enough to make me wanna watch 10 more movies on that series.",Jigsaw
222,mrsmiley-03590,"Feels more like a reboot to me, a terrible one.",3,29 October 2017,"I should mention that my review doesn't really have any spoilers, but when I go into the logic of the situation where people are at the barn might be considered as such, so I put spoiler tag just in case.OK, I went to the theaters and saw Jigsaw. It was a pre-screening, so I thought it might be useful to write a review about this movie since it will be about a month before Jigsaw will be officially released in my area (Finland). A huge thanks to my friend who suggested this pre-screening (despite my dislike for the movie after seeing it).I have seen the first two Saw movies and watched reviews of rest of them, so I do have a general idea what Saw franchise is about. I might not remember important details, but bare with me. I really liked the first movie, because it was intense without blood spilling every time. It was more like a crime-thriller than ""horror"" splatter/gore that rest of the Saw movies were. Some say they are torture porn, since Jigsaw and traps are the main reason why people watch it. I'll admit, most of the traps are pretty creative, but also really stupid. If not taken seriously, you might enjoy Saw movies more.So, 8th Saw movie is now a thing, so how does it compare to previous movies? Not that much. We now have a competent directors, editor, cinematography and decent acting. These don't sound bad, but I just have a huge problem that probably is isn't a problem for you, but let me explain what I mean. Jigsaw lacks it's own identity in some ways. There is no quick editing or camera work that made you feel like you were inside the building with the characters. As much as I think that Saw's style isn't that great, but at least it feel like it had it's own thing for the most part. Too many movies feel like they are made by same people, despite having different people. Maybe it's studios fault? Best words I can use to describe all of this are: standardized and tamed.In my country, Saw movies were rated 18, but Jigsaw is rated 16, so this is already a warning sign. While Jigsaw had some gore, it was more tame compared to rest of the Saw movies. Maybe I'm just desensitized, but if you seriously are going to make a Saw sequel, don't you think that you should go all in with the gore, since Saw movies usually have poor writing anyway (except for the first Saw). Jigsaw seem to be more focused on CGI than before. Say what ever you about the Saw films, but you have to admit that it had very good practical effects. CGI that it had were alright, but one of the shots were really bad in my opinion. Too many movies nowadays relies on computer effects, which can look so noticeable even if it's not bad.Speaking of the writing, plot was just as convoluted and silly as the previous movies, but unfortunately not in a good (funny) way. Usually you would laugh at ridiculousness of Saw's plots, but since Jigsaw is more standardized than any other Saw movie, it doesn't create the same effect. This is disappointing, because I honestly wanted to have a laugh. This movie is much more Hollywood than Saw.I think I shouldn't waste my time with the plot, since this is a spoiler-free review and I'm reviewing a Saw movie, but I should mention a few things. I'm not going to spoil anything, just talking about the idea and you know Jigsaw takes place in a barn. If you are trapped in a barn and you are not running out of time at all, don't you think that trying the break the wall (that is made of planks, WOOD!) could be a smart idea? I mean, it's a big building, so the odds of traps are small (not to mention, that on the outside, there simply couldn't be any complex traps), since Jigsaw simply cannot predict where the victims can escape. The movie shows that there are many tools around the barn. No timer = no hurry. So, why not spend some time trying break the wall? Saw movies usually have situations where victims should explore the area, but previous movies at least had strong walls and blocked doors. Also, if the building is full of traps, it's a stupid idea to check the places with someone, since both of them can be trapped if they trigger something. Scout the place before everyone else goes or use any tools you could have.OK, I might unfair to this movie, but I honestly didn't enjoy it. I was most of the time bored. Sure, acting was decent, but the characters didn't have anything special or unique about them. Maybe the one character (not Jigsaw) was sort of interesting, but was still a lackluster character. Direction wasn't bad, but again it was too Hollywood like. Plot points were predictable and gore aspects were disappointing.Bad movies can be enjoyable, but Jigsaw was just ""bad"" and boring. Competent movie makers can either make a really good movie or just boring ones (yes, there are exceptions too). Incompetent movie makers can make the movie hilarious in unintentional ways.There simply isn't much to say about Jigsaw other than what I already said. The movie is forgettable. Enjoyment level were 2/10 but giving a 3/10 rating is more fitting, since the movie was ""competent"" but really boring. I don't recommend Jigsaw. Go watch something else. Anything else that is released in theaters is probably at least slightly better than Jigsaw.",Jigsaw

The first is a Classic and may have one of the best twists of all time, and that's what makes it such a great film. It wasn't about the horror.This one, although entertaining, same awkward acting by many characters, same grizzly traps, and most of all a twist, which I believe everyone expects, however I feel there's some major plot holes that leaves me feeling dissatisfied. Of course I won't ruin for anyone, but this film reaches far, way too far, in my humble opinion.Very reminiscent of the original, but fails in the end. Maybe they'll do better next time because a new Saw film is always welcome to take a swing.Note: the red headed coroner was super hot, even before she let her hair down and took her glasses off. Way too hot to be a coroner. (not being sexist, just keeping it real)",Jigsaw
230,adamcarter-63372,Solid Sequel Even If It Misses What Saw Truly Is,7,28 October 2017,"Jigsaw is a movie I've been waiting a long time for. After Saw 7 or Saw: ""The Final Chapter"" I was seriously let down. It did a terrible job bringing the series to a close and so obviously I was unsatisfied. JIgsaw doesn't necessarily cure this because we don't get to see Dr. Gordon even though he was established as an apprentice. Outside of a view small references and JIgsaw himself, of course, this new installment is made up of completely new characters.However, I highly enjoyed this film even if it misses what Saw truly is. The filmmakers were clearly trying to go more psychological with this one but they missed the point. The plot of Saw is intertwined with its traps and psychological elements. The best example in this is with the Saw 6 health care plot. The traps were symbolic of what William was doing and what he had to go through directly correlates with the physiological elements. Most of the traps in this film were mild and didn't correlate with the psychological elements. The majority of the Saw films have great plot lines but critics and audiences alike are too grossed out to think about anything else than the gore or what the gore means. The new Saw film just simply doesn't understand that.This film also doesn't have the look of previous Saw films. It's higher definition and while some may like that I think it makes it lose its personality and just look like any other movie. All the fast-paced editing and spinning camera has been ripped from the movie which also bothered me. If you're going to rip away all this style, replace it with something different, which they didn't.So why am I giving this an 7 out of 10. It's still an enjoyable Saw film. I love the mystery that surrounds the film with the question if Jigsaw has somehow come back from the dead. The idea of having to confess was also genius. All of the characters did something awful and they weren't able to admit to the fact that they did it. Laura Vandervoort character is the best example of it. She did something awful and then convinced herself it was her husband's fault.The twist, while being a bit redundant of Saw 2, was well done. Also, the key being in the bullet was cleaver. She could have saved them both but instead, wasted the bullet in fear. The same fear when she suffocated her baby. John Kramer had clearly stated to balance the situation. Two wrongs don't make a right.I am a bit worried about the new apprentice taking over. He just doesn't seem like he's going to be that interesting. Costas Mandylor's Mark Hoffman may not have been the most fleshed out character but he had presence. This new guy doesn't seem to have that. Only time will tell if he is good or not but I can't help but feel worried.I hope in the next installment they bring back the original look and style. Mentioning previous films would be great as well. What happened to Dr. Gordon. Why did he become an apprentice? What happened to his family? What about Hoffman? Did he escape or is he dead? I don't think ignoring the previous films is the right direction to go on. They should use them to continue to build the story.Overall, I highly enjoyed this film even it misses what Saw truly is. It's not as good as Saw 1,2,3 or 6 but I'd say it's definitely better than the others. As a Saw fan, I am quite pleased with this film and I hope this film does well l so there will be more Saw films to come.",Jigsaw

So 10 years later, bodys start appearing around the area. Obviously people point fingers at the jigsaw killer aka john Kramer or a copycat. As the boring dull police investigation drags, we see 5 victims stranded in a barn with tests yet to complete.
Now, I was excited for this. After walking out of the theater, I wasn't just overwhelmed.. But I also thought to myself "".... I know the director of saw 2 didn't put any effort in part 4, but damn...""
The traps were uninspired and less creative to the extreme. There was dread/fear in the previous saw movies especially the first 3 but in this one they take all of that away and rely on heavy CGI and easy tame ideas to get filming done quicker... 
cough cough GRAIN SILO.. cough... SILO WIRES...Borrowing all things from the first 7 and toning everything down is a big mistake especially for a hardcore saw fanatic. Everything felt unfinished and unsatisfying, but I still had high hopes for the ""great ending"" that the directors were hyping up about.
spoilers but.. not just the horrible cgi at the end, but that twist really wasn't a twist to me. It just added something to the timeline that made everything even more complicated... not in a good way either. John CLEARLY said in 7 that Dr Gordon was his very first associate/apprentice. So I just dont see how the barn game/new apprentice thing was all before 1.. just makes it frustrating.

250,antonkid,Holy smokes is this movie horrible,1,3 March 2018,"Even given how the Saw series isn't meant to be some highly intellectual or complicated or deep piece of work, this movie still somehow manages to do a disservice to it.
In typical horror movie fashion, the characters in the movie make all the stupidest choices. In a universe where the Jigsaw killer exists, and the characters are shown to be fully aware of who he is, why would they make decisions in the game that would very clearly lead to someone dying?
The ""puzzles"": the magic to the puzzles that were constructed in previous movies was that they did not require an observer to trigger them. A pint of blood filling a jar to its limit, a severed limb to account for the needed weight to release the players, that kind of thing. The first two puzzles in this movie already defy that and completely ruin immersion. 
Jigsaw: in what very well may be the worst besmirching of a character that I can recall, the Jigsaw killer is completely stripped of his character. We are expected to believe that John Kramer, whose focal point regarding his puzzles was that people intentionally did something bad and had to atone for it, put the orderly who misplaced his (Jigsaw's) name tag when tagging the x-ray that showed his tumor into one of his puzzles. They then try to casually explain that ""but John had a change of heart and couldn't sentence a man for what was an honest mistake"". Bullshit, that's a cop out and the director should be ashamed. 1/10, a piece of shit movie, don't waste your time. You won't even get to see any gore, as if they deliberately made this pile of garbage PG.",Jigsaw
251,aazzam,worth seeing some nice surprises though the ploy may seem familiar,6,2 November 2017,"i went to see jigsaw last night and it was worth the effort, tobin bell was excellent, the leg trap was really uncomfortable and the way the bicycle trap went wrong was very nice, i also liked the final laser trap and its outcome. the woman who appeared with the weird obsession was a nice bizarre touch, i am trying to describe some of the things which happened without giving away their outcomes. several scenes made me cringe, aside from the leg scene i felt that maybe some of the horror had been toned down to create more of a thriller than a pure horror film. i think jigsaw was very entertaining but could have been even more horrific than it was. the plot twists worked very well, the final revelation made sense and was a real surprise. the characters had some nice development, their crimes were certainly worth challenging making the film morally ambiguous. one female character did something really bad which turned out to be a really disturbing moment, she meets an appropriate fate. i thought i had figured out who it was, the final minutes proved i was wrong on one very important score there. the practical effects were very good, one cgi moment near the end stood out as being obvious cgi though it was a nasty idea. i was glad to be able to watch an adult horror movie for a change, it is also very good and worth catching, as is the ritual. in some ways these two are better as they are less used, saw has now run to eight films and is running out of original ideas, some of jigsaw seemed a bit samey even though it was well made it seemed like some old and familiar ideas. i would be prepared to watch more sequels, though saying that they will all follow similar structures, which is really a given with this series.",Jigsaw

254,iNathanJagger,Easy way to bring it back,7,28 October 2017,"Before I began, I would just I would just like to say, I am a big fan of the Saw franchise - I loved it from when I was 13 and watched every single one to (hopefully) know the entire story. And I went to this one with really high hopes, with no expectation of being annoyed! While watching this I didn't find it hard to keep on the storyline, it was quite easy to understand 'the game' until the end, you'll have to go over it in your head a few times and tell someone so you understand yourself. When the detectives are on the case they kind of take a massive shot in the dark which is like why point the finger that them when they are supposed to know this kind of thing, it's very much like they want to blame almost anyone for 'the game'. The only thing in my eyes which they lacked on was the media coverage: they showed multiple press people but never the actual media coverage and the uproar from the public. It was very much like a play on a stage with a few scenes to swap from each other, wherein the 'Saw' movies there was a full scene but it felt more open and not like they had space and used the limits of it. Towards the ending you think 'case closed' but its Jigsaw, its never case closed without a few flashbacks: which yeah that doesn't change, which I loved. But the ending: this brought it down for me, granted its a lot of things, probably less than the other movies - but it's not the best of them at all! The big plot twist is who is the so- called 'New' Jigsaw, well with no spoiler: when you find out who it is, you're like why? then there's an even bigger plot twist that makes it all fall into place. So the 'the game' is made for someone you wouldn't expect at all, there's is so-called 'archive' footage but you wouldn't have seen it in the first saga of movies, at the ending everything does fall into place. This movie isn't the best one at all in the whole sagas as it has revenge as well as a new saga starting in one. It does a good ritual for the old movies kind of showing its a new set of movies based 10 years after the first events. And when I say saga, I do think this is like a series 2 set of movies for Jigsaw with much more to come. But they will let a lot of fans down with this one!",Jigsaw

This is a great movie as there are so many of these found footage crap films, my experience of these are they are not scary, they just leave you with a bad migraine. A good example of this is the Blair Witch project, this must be the worst movie I have ever seen, it was not scary and how anyone classified it as a horror film I do not know. Onto Saw, the main thing that pleased me is that it was a new chapter to the franchise and not a remake of the original ( I would never say reboot, reboot is what you do to a computer). The film starts with four people in a room being told they had to perform tasks in order to free themselves, this is how the film carries on leading to the detectives believing that Jigsaw may not actually be dead and instead of a copycat killer, it could be jigsaw himself. The only bad thing about these movies is at the end kind of like Miss Marple, I can never figure how they come to the conclusion. I did not think it was very scary, but there were plenty of stomach churning moments in the film, I just hope if they make another it is a new film and not a remake.",Jigsaw

I think that is why a lot of my friends find this movie good. They haven't seen the other saw movies so on that basis I can say that this is an alright (but not more than that) horror movie on its own. But even though it is ""a new beginning"" of the saw franchise it is still a part of it which it highly doesn't live up to. It just cannot be compared to the other movies at all. 1. The traps are boring and not memorable or unique at all. 2. Jigsaw is the only person mentioned from the earlier movies that means no flashback or anything. 3. It is way too polished and good looking and ""clean"" to be a saw movie. If the other saw movies were good stable rusty Toyotas this new saw movie is a shiny new Mercedes. They don't fit together like a Jigsaw at all. I do have one good thing about it though and that is the big surprise element in the end that is one of the things I love the most in saw movies.

But I am sure that no one expected that this picture would be so mediocre and empty. Actors are mannequins, the plot is a pit, twists are not twists at all, traps and trials cause a grin and sadness. ""Saw"" was, first of all, a good thriller, and secondly, a good inventive horror. Here we observe the absolute tragedy of directorial work. For the whole film, it was only nice to see Tobin Bell, and his 5 minutes on the screen. Unfortunately, he does not rescue this picture in any way.

So, at last the big ""two timelines"" reveal, and all I could think was was the same word that I've since seen in several (dozen) other reviews: Lame.The game wasn't much of a game at all.

This movie had its scary moments and its funny moments, I give it a 9/10 because i have been waiting for a long time, I actually got to learn what happened after all these years but disappointing because Gordon and Hoffman weren't revealed. We still don't know what happened to them :(",Jigsaw
270,ABCloverLane,"Slick and stylish, but ultimately disappointing",4,26 October 2017,"Since the Saw franchise is one of my biggest guilty pleasures when it comes to horror, I've been hoping for a new installment ever since The Final Chapter was supposed to end the franchise back in 2010. Even though the movies got progressively worse, there is something about this franchise that always draws me back and makes me want to re-watch it.I had high expectations for Jigsaw because of two reasons: one, the producers stated in an interview that they were offered more than a hundred scripts for a new movie from different writers, but had never been pleased with any of them until they discovered a script so good, which ultimately got picked to be adapted; second, the Spierig brothers, Jigsaw's directors, had previously directed Predestination, such a smart and enticing sci-fi time- travel movie that I liked quite a lot.After seeing Jigsaw, I left the theater disappointed. I'll start with what I enjoyed:The score by Charlie Clouser is just as fabulous as it has always been and manages to go in line perfectly with each scene.The performances didn't bother me at all, although none of the actors really gets to shine. Laura Vandervoort and Paul Braunstein stood out here, with the latter generating some funny moments worthy of admiration.The direction was very polished and the movie was competently filmed, but the Spierig brothers weren't given much to show their creativity on. This leads me to the negatives.The CGI is very good. There is, however, one scene in which I was feeling as if I was watching one of the most recent Resident Evil movies and that didn't really work for me.What I didn't like:The ideas in this movie and its overall plot are somewhat underdeveloped. I know that this is supposed to be a new ""beginning"" for these movies, but as a franchise starter, I wanted more to be explored. The plot falls flat because the movie cuts from scene to scene so swiftly and tries to cram multiple narratives into 85 minutes, that ultimately none of them makes an impact.Saw is known for its visceral traps and torture devices, so I was looking forward to seeing more of that. However, the game presented in this movie has next to no memorable traps. That is because they are a lot tamer than what we've seen before and they simply can't hold a candle to all the ingenious traps from the past movies.The character development is another issue in this movie. The characters are so uni-dimensional, with some of them being there only to fill the screen. And I'm referring to some of the main casting here. Also, character arcs are left unfinished and the movie felt like it ended when the most important part of the story was about to happen.The editing undermines what could've been some very suspenseful scenes because of its sloppiness, by cutting from one narrative (the game) to the other (the investigation) at random moments.Now, it all comes down to the twist. Was it good and unexpected? Well, no, not really. It's not necessarily because you can predict it from miles away (for which the movie offers hints throughout the run-time) due to its small set of characters, but because it had no resonance for me. It didn't blow me away and you could've predicted it from the marketing of the movie alone. Just like with the traps, it just doesn't have the same visceral feel as the past movies and it doesn't really make you crave for the release of the next chapter.Overall, Jigsaw sets itself apart from the previous movies in the series with the help of the two directors who manage to make the movie look stylish and slick, but ultimately, it doesn't succeed in creating the sense of urgency that some of the old movies had and, sadly, disappoints on almost every other level. And yes, there are fan-service moments, but as a fan of this franchise, I felt very little excitement when they happened.Hopefully, if the movie does well in terms of box office, the sequel will improve upon this franchise ""reinvention"".",Jigsaw
271,samdumorris,The Legend Is Back,9,3 November 2017,If you love horror/thriller type of movies you must have seen at least one of Saw movies. It's been 7 years since the last Saw movie and with this one Jigsaw makes a great comeback. Like all Saw movies this one is also tied with the other ones and also gives you a new perspective about the previous ones. The plot looks simple at first. Looking like a classic John Kramer game where he wants justice and trying to teach a lesson to his chosen players. But as the movie continues it gets more complicated and it keeps you on the edge of your seat which is great. And as we get to climax part of the movie the legendary Saw music starts playing and all of the things that you are confused about is explained and you're just left with an open mouth. Because the plot twist is really good and a clever one. So i think this is a really must see!!,Jigsaw
272,krismoren,Lacking and a little disappointing.,4,2 November 2017,"It would be untruthful to say that Jigsaw, the eighth installment in the now iconic Saw series, was not disappointing- even for a hardcore, loyal fan such as myself. As a recent fan of the series (I began watching in about April/May), I found myself suddenly immersed in the complex, twist-filled Saw universe, intrigued not only by the creative traps, but by what insane plot twist they could come up with next. Watching the series is always fun, never short of gore or convoluted plot lines and many timelines (often occurring at once). However, I'm not sure the same could be said about Jigsaw. What is most noticeable about the eighth installment right off the bat is that it seems to have lost a lot of the low-budget charm that made the first movie (and those that followed and imitated the style of the first) unique. While the cinematography can be commended at some parts, it seems that the film has been scrubbed clean of the grime and grit, the sickly greens and cold blues, and the insane camera-work that gave the first films personality. This sequel is much cleaner, and doesn't really have the same look or atmosphere of the other films. It is clear that a lot of the creativity is gone. For a Saw movie, it's not necessarily bad- it's just not what a Saw movie should be. A lot of what Saw is about is tension; biting your nails or hiding behind your hands as you wait for the trap to spring into action, for the viewer to fail. It's the anticipation, the suspense the film builds throughout its run time before pulling the rug out from under the viewer. In a lot of ways, that's absent from this sequel. The traps, while sometimes gory, never pack quite the same punch as some of the first. There's some gross stuff, but never anything that hits you as hard as watching someone saw off their own foot or fall into a pit of needles. Other than the final one, none of the traps feel like anything that we haven't seen before. Not only that; the traps never hold the same weight that they do in the first few films. It's not that the characters don't want to live; it's that we're not sure if we care to see them live OR even care to see them fail. You're never afraid to see a character fail a trap simply because we're not afraid to see what happens when they do. There's nothing an average moviegoer can't handle. But, not everyone shows up for the gore- so what about the plot? Well, without spoiling, the plot -and twist- are a little underwhelming. It's not like you can see it coming from a mile away, but you CAN sense when the writers are tossing in a red herring or can feel when they want you to believe a character is an apprentice. I had quite a few assumptions about the plot that were proved right, and that, in a lot of ways, was extremely disappointing to me. And the ending doesn't really make you gasp or has you feeling too shocked. You simply sit there, watching the flashback montage, and go, ""oh. Okay."" In a lot of ways, this movie is for and not for the fans. It's quite confusing. It's clear that the use of some tropes and aspects present in the original films (what very, very few there were) were there as a sort of fan-servicing- but in a way, some aspects feel as if they're isolating the fans from their beloved horror series. It's hard to determine whether this film was for old time fans, or to rope in a new, larger audience. Or, you know, for money. If you are a fan, I'd recommend showing up with very little in mind and shutting your brain off. If you're expecting to have an amazing time, you won't- but it's an okay watch. I don't feel as if I'll need to see this movie again, but I don't feel completely satisfied. It's quite odd. Arrive with no expectations. And, if you're feeling incredibly skeptical, just wait for Redbox.",Jigsaw

The acting is terrible, the direction is terrible, the script is terrible, the pacing is terrible and the ""twist"" and traps are all...you guessed it...terrible. The original 7 SAW movies built a rich story of a man seeking a higher purpose for the relatively short time he had left on the planet. This story was woven with layer after layer of twists and turns that actually piggy-backed off of each other to leave the viewer with really good WOW moments...for instance:When we find out that the victim with the key under his eye in SAW 2 was operated on by Dr Gordon, THAT MAKES SENSE...because Gordon WAS a surgeon. When we learn that Hoffman is also an apprentice, THAT MAKES SENSE because there is manpower required to move and hang victims that a bed ridden Jigsaw and 80 pound Amanda couldn't have. This movie, introducing ANOTHER apprentice and giving ZERO reason why he's never mentioned in the SEVEN other movies is absolutely insane. I'm sure someone will point out ""But, he was the guy who mixed up the X-rays!""...uh...OK...except, mixed up X-rays are never talked about in any of the SEVEN other movies...even in the later movies where we get the bulk of Kramer's story, we are told that he knew he had cancer and the reason he wasn't operated on is because his insurance denied him for ""pre-existing conditions"". Another thing that drove me NUTS about this movie is this: when the people make it past the part where the chains are initially released from around their necks, they go right for the LOCKED DOOR...when the barn they're in is rickety as HECK and you can clearly see that the boards holding it together are quite far apart, old and could, most likely, be broken through with ANY of the farm tools that are just lying around. I mean, COME ON. They try and show, later, that old PigFace is stalking them, making sure that they finish the game but, at this point, there are THREE players still left, in relatively good shape and, if all of them grabbed an axe, Pick, shovel and broke through the side of the dang barn, they could take on whoever came at them together. Also, the ""new Jigsaw""...Jesus Christ. Please, PLEASE don't let this guy come back to the series...he's an awful actor, has a crap backstory and absolutely ZERO charisma. If he's supposed to be the guy to lead the series forward...wow. Just...wow. Lastly...the traps are the reason that people watch these movies and the ""traps"" in this movie are utter trash.

289,kdeyo-962-212101,Interesting comeback with some originality,7,2 November 2017,"After 7 years since Saw 3D, I was curious to see how much the story would be related to the ending of that film. To my surprise, they did not do anything with that arc at all. In my opinion, this was a very good option since I believe that arc was going on for too long and became very confusing. With this film, it felt fresh with new characters to watch. However, it seemed to use clichéd moments which became predictable after seeing twists at the end of the first 7 movies. The time change became evident after a while when viewing, but the editing was clever to be convincing that Jigsaw was alive for most of the movie. The film also felt as if it were trying to set up another series of films towards the end, but also trying to stay independent. This method can work, but I felt like it was a little off. The production quality is much better than the films 5-7, and matches the idea from the first films. If there is enough for a Saw 9, and they fix some of the issues with being independent, I believe the series will be good again",Jigsaw
290,tbymcm1,"Great comeback, but doesn't live up to the originals",7,27 January 2018,"I was late watching the original Saw movies. Very late. I didn't watch them until 7 months before Jigsaw came to theatres. That said, I watched them all and was impressed with the intricate plot and creativity of James Wan and Leigh Whannell some 14+ years ago.Before I talk about this release, I think some context is important. The Saw franchise has 4 distinct directors. Each movie pays respect to the previous films, yet develops an exciting twist for the next movie. Jigsaw accomplished this, just like Saw I-VII. That said, Jigsaw is a very different movie and we as an audience have changed since the last movie was released in 2010. The 2017 adaptation, for me, was well written and directed but it does not meet the expectations of many Saw fans. The Spierig Brothers chose to create a more gorey and in-your-face approach to the games. Production was much better quality (for better or worse). 
Overall, the movie lacked the iconic ""gotcha"" twists which were in the early original films. For me, I rated this a 7 due to the movie's ability to overlap with the originals yet be distinct in the timing of the story. I believe this movie was a good ending to the franchise we have come to know and love. As always, watch the series again before seeing Jigsaw. You'll be glad you did!",Jigsaw

That gave me the reason, why I thought, that the plot and the instigator of the ''games'' will be very clear. Uhu, no no, it wasn't. Jigsaw got me again. How can I be so stupid? Haha. Secretly, I love it. Me as ignorant viewer, not knowing anything. But it remains a horror movie, so the narrative and act of telling was not that strong/powerful. The special effects, bloody scenes and splitting body's looked very real. They made that pretty real, my compliments. One thing I didn't like in this movie was the irritating man, Paul Braunstein.

This is filled with twists and turns, making everyone wonder what just happened. If you have followed the franchise so far, you know what has happened to jigsaw and his following, but this film has some great twists. The thing I loved about this film is that it feels like you are trying to find out who the killer is as well when they end up throwing a random plot twist in it. Everyone around me had their jaws drop with some of the reveals and twists. If you like the original films, this did not disappoint and is one of my favorite in the Franchise. The traps are more unsettling and the intensity is still high. They answer some of the questions that were previously left, while also leaving it open for other films to be made in the future, while also being able to end the film to satisfy if they decide to end the franchise.

301,ofakindgaming,Rebirth of the Saw movies by going back to it's roots.,8,25 January 2018,"I wrote this immediately after watching the movie, I didn't proof read or go over anything I said so sorry if it is a jumbled mess. I strictly went based off my love for the Saw movies. There is also a message to the directors and writers at the end.I think many people writing reviews here never saw (ha) the original 7 movies. I see many people talking about how they felt how John Kramer's reason to be jigsaw is what made the movies good. Only issue with that statement is that only follows for the first 3 maybe 4 movies. Yes in those movies John's story is fascinating and makes you can't help but watch despite the horrible scenarios being shown to you. If you did follow the story you would know he intended for there to be multiple people to continue and pass down his ""mission"". He had multiple students (which we now know was at least 4). Amanda, Hoffman, Gordon, and now Nelson. The first two failed Johns' intentions but Dr. Gordon and Dr. Nelson succeeded. The point being if you followed the story line this was going to happen no matter what. John was going to eventually be replaced. Saw isn't about ""John's struggle through life trying to make people see life through his eyes by making them struggle too"". It's about John's ideals on how ones opinion of their life can vastly change in a near death experience, and how for those who have done great wrong must also go through an equally horrible experience in order to fully understand just how to live their life. With that being said I'll now talk about what made this movie in my opinion (as someone who has deeply followed the story and has seen all the movies multiple times) one of, if not the best in the series.Anyone who has watched the original 7 movies would probably agree the best were 1-3 (maybe 4), but after that the quality of the movies drastically dropped. The story was still there but only barely. It was obvious with the success of the movies they lost sight of what made them so popular to begin with. It wasn't about the ""traps"". Yes the traps were the true horror aspect of the movies and were interesting to see play out, but it wasn't what made the movies good. The sad part is that's what Hollywood believed made the movies so popular. Leaving us with the last 3 movies mostly being about the traps and not about the people. What's even worse is the acting and visual quality of the movies got to the point it was practically a joke. In prep for Jigsaw's release my cousin and I re-watched the original 7. In movie 6 on the playground roundabout scene you can easily tell as the people die they are blatantly replaced with mannequins in the next scenes. I felt insulted as if the movies that lured me in eventually just stopped caring.With Jigsaw however, it seems like they realized this and threw that out the window. The traps were still majority of the movie but that's to be expected after coming back from a hiatus of 7 years. They needed something to ""wow"" the audience and draw them in again. However unlike the previous 3 movies, Jigsaw went back to it's roots. The traps weren't about the shock factor, they were about the people in the traps again. Once again it made you want to know more about the people and why they were in the traps and fulfilled that curiosity. In the previous 3 movies many of the people in the traps you barely knew why they were in the traps. It didn't make you care enough to see through John's eyes on why they should be there. With Jigsaw though, they kept you interested on why the people were in the traps and gave reasons that actually make sense in the story. In the previous 3 many people in the traps were there for almost no reason and once that reason was told it was played off like it was no big deal which would make no sense for the people to be in the traps in the first place (I realize this was part of the story for Hoffman. He was supposed to be John's failed prodigy who killed just to kill and not because he truly saw things like John.).For the story of the saw films this movie brought it back to being equal priority to the shock factor of the movies. I've already mentioned how Jigsaw brought back your curiosity for the story of the people in the traps, but what it also succeeded in was raising your curiosity in the story of those who lay the traps. In the original 7, the movies made you wonder how John's apprentices would continue his legacy and want to know more about what drove them to want to follow him. They however failed to follow through with that by focusing more on the shock factor of the traps with the final few movies. Where Jigsaw brought this back was by seemingly creating a new John Kramer with Nelson. They brought back what intrigued us about John. Nelson is the first apprentice to truly follow in John's footsteps. John became jigsaw through his brush with death in a car accident (many reviews I'm seeing say how it was his cancer, which if you actually follow the story isn't true. John didn't see value in life until he was in a car accident that temporarily got rid of his cancer.), similarly Nelson became jigsaw with his brush with death in one of John's traps (like all of John's apprentices). What makes Nelson different than any other victim or apprentice in the story is he was John's only mistake that was also a success. Despite putting Nelson in a trap that he later felt he didn't deserve Nelson still learned John's lesson and saw things the way John did after surviving his trap. Nelson is John's one true success. Dr. Gordon was a success as well but he wasn't to the level that Nelson is, it doesn't help how badly the original movies butchered his story. There are many things that could have been done to save the original movies that weren't done in time. Jigsaw can fix that issue by creating a new one with a new John Kramer, a new Jigsaw killer. Honestly I believe this movie could revive the series and start a new story that I hope they will do justice to this time around. I can already see the similarities to John Kramer within Nelson. Just like in Saw 1 he put himself in his trap, and it also seems Nelson is also starting to take in apprentices (Eleanor, seeing how she wasn't in his trap, drugged, or shown any time after entering the barn) that are already far more interesting than John's other 3 apprentices just because of how this movie was handled. I would love if they somehow gave us closure to Dr. Gordon's story as well. I can't wait to see how they handle the following movies and believe this movie deserves far more credit than it received. I feel like it was unjustly hated by people who didn't actually care for the story of the original movies and by people who didn't even watch all the movies.To the directors and writers of this movie. Thank you for seeing the movies for what they were meant to be and for bringing the spirit of the first 3 movies back. I don't blame the writers or directors of the last 4 for their failure, I just think it was handled poorly. You however were able to revive the love for these movies and I thank you for it. You make an amazing team and I truly hope all of you continue to work well with each other and on these movies. Thank you; Michael Spierig, Peter Spierig, Pete Goldfinger, and Josh Stolberg.",Jigsaw

Did the grass magically grow in back in 2 seconds, or did the police ignore the fact that there is a fresh heap of sand on the grave, thereby already indicating that something is going on???The traps were also very underwelming and confusing to be honest. I suppose an excuse for this could be that this is technically the first time jigsaw has attempted this, and his craft wasn't fully fleshed out. Nonetheless, for a movie this anticipated, it would have been wise to incorporate better traps.The flashback aspect of it, does provide confusion and surprise, so at least that's something, but all in all, it's a movie that was unnecessary to make.",Jigsaw

Hell, I'm aware that 3D was bad, but at least I respected that it wrapped up the franchise well, and was only produced in less than a year.Lionsgate has had 7 years. 7 YEARS to come up with a good plot; a good reason to bring back the franchise. Yet, somehow they managed to come up with the most convoluted, contrived nonsense ever. Boring, nonsensical traps. Poor characters and acting. Cringy effects. Zero suspense. Everything that made Saw unique is gone - the editing style, the gritty aesthetic and tone. It just feels like fan fiction - a straight to DVD Saw spin off.Jigsaw himself being in a flashback again? Borrring. As great as Tobin Bell is, it's just getting stale and forced now. Just set a new era without him. They've already showed that a person can manipulate and edit all of his old tapes to record new ones (Seriously, that's a thing) so why not drop his character entirely. Bring Tobin Bell back to record those tapes for the films though, of course.And that twist. Really? Did they really just give us yet another apprentice, one that somehow was involved with Jigsaw 10 years ago. How. creative. and. original. And... how did he create those traps and orchestrate everything just by himself? Who knows? suspension of disbelief, who needs it!?Everything about the ending, from the editing direction, writing, acting was all poorly executed and awkward. It just didn't flow well, nor create that epic feeling of sudden realization we had in the Saw franchise. It was an insult for the Saw theme to be used over such a pathetic 'reveal'.My last thoughts are this: Why didn't they just use the idea that it's a cult? A massive following - it shows that jigsaw's ideology pierced the minds of many, and that his legacy is truly living on through a new generation of psychopaths. That would have be sweet, and it would have give reason and logic behind there being extremely ridiculous traps. yet, no, we have yet another accomplice.For the first time in my life I'm embarrassed to be a Saw fan.

313,kaiju120,Mid-range entry treads water,6,29 November 2017,"Like many devotees of this particular horror series, I spent the better part of a decade dutifully reporting to my nearest cinema the weekend before Halloween, checking in on ole John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer and his ever-growing class of proteges. Each installment was like a new season in an ever-complicated horror TV serial with a complex continuity, oodles of flashbacks, an ensemble cast of (mostly Canadian) actors of widely varied talent, and of course, those gruesome Rube Goldberg style traps.When the series finally bottomed out in 2010 with Kevin Greutert's oddly self-loathing SAW 3D, there seemed to be little chance of another entry, but here we are once again.For better or worse, the Spierig Brothers' JIGSAW ignores the events of parts 4-7 and takes a stab at getting back to basics, stripping away the convoluted backstory and flashbacks that weighed down previous entries in a tactic that is the film's greatest strength and weakness.The production value has never been higher and there's some modest innovation here (filming outdoors, an online Jigsaw fan club, the farm setting), but there's an unwillingness to stray too far from formula, resulting in a decidedly middle of the road entry that never hits the high highs (1, 2, 6) or low lows (3, 5, 3D) of the series while freely recycling traps and twists from past installments. I guess I'm saying this is on par with SAW IV? Once again, a gang of small-time criminals goes through a gauntlet of traps, starting off with a chained neck game lifted from SAW V. And once again, a new group of TV cops is on the case, setting up an inevitable collision between the law and the saw. Despite hinting for the umpteenth time that Jigsaw somehow survived getting his throat slit back in SAW III, the guy is still dead. Eleven years later, the series is still unwilling to jump the shark and introduce a twin brother or just reanimate his ass with lightning, JASON LIVES style. Instead, the great Tobin Bell makes a welcome appearance thanks to a cross-cutting timeline shift used to similar effect in Darren Lynn Bousman's SAW II. We get some intriguing new disciples, while previous sidekicks Shawnee Smith and Costas Mandylor are neither seen nor mentioned. (Sorry Hoffman fans, I think we're to assume he's super dead and rotting in that gross bathroom.) If you're a fan of the series, particularly the first three films, you'll likely be satisfied with this installment, if only for it being a massive improvement over SAW 3D. If you never developed a taste for the reverse bear traps and infinite exposition loops that were the specialty of SAW, then maybe stay home and read a good book or something.**Evil puppet laugh**",Jigsaw

Yeah, in it's core, it's a saw film, but only because of the general theme, music, and Tobin Bell.Now the film is somewhat entertaining, but it doesn't hold a candle to any of the old saw films, even the lesser ones.The old saw films usually had a twist that didn't need explaining. They'd show you through flashbacks, visuals, and reactions. While this film has an interesting twist, Logan just... Explains his whole plan...?He literally just tells a guy he's about to kill what the whole plan was all along. That alone doesn't make alot of sense, but it also feels very Scooby-Doo-ish.This example shows what bugs me about this film. It wants to be saw, but this showed that in terms of writing it just can't get it quite right.

322,jktop101,It takes a lot of creativity to bring back a franchise that was supposed to end.,8,6 February 2018,I'm a die hard fan of the saw franchise. And before watching the movie I wanted to check on the ratings on IMDB. Reading through the reviews I was impressed by how negative the reviews were for the movie. I have just watched the movie and I have to say that I enjoyed the movie like a 7 out of 10. There was definitely some things that could have been better and from an strictly objective point of view I understand why people gives it a low rating.But you have to understand that it is very hard to bring back a franchise that was supposed to end after the 8th installment. A lot of the plot holes has been filled during the 8 movie run but Im glad that they finally came up with a script from which that they can develop from it. Keep in mind that producers cant deliver much of a wow effect from that single script from which they are able to develop again. Its like expecting a baby to speak like a grown man when it barely figures out how to be able to walk. But this time its like the baby just learned how to breath and walk in another planet other than earth where it has been wowing us this whole timeWhat you will enjoy a lot from this movie is how the story is able to continue from where every single plot hole was seriously determined to end.I did enjoy this movie a lot but there is just one thing that I didnt like at all.I dont like the new substitute for Jigsaw at all. Yes the movie did a great job of hiding him till the very end but he feels like a very generic antagonist for a franchise as great as saw. He is not unique at all. I didnt like the way he suddenly changed out of nowhere to reveal the truth. It just didnt suit his character. Its like the producers decided to hide the truth from the actor till the very end of the film and the actor just didnt know how to portray the sudden role given to him.

326,torafuliar,Without having seen any of the others...,6,29 October 2017,"I am in a unique position because I would not have chosen to go and see this movie. I was invited to it for a friends birthday, I can give you my honest opinion with no prior experience\expectations with the franchise.Not once did I feel I was missing out having not knowing the series, As a stand alone movie it did well misdirecting suspicion in some parts. However in a lot of movie I found myself telegraphing what was going to happen and knowing what was there for a second viewing which I like to be in the dark for until the second time round. I can forgive this cause there won't be a next time. The people I was with all said the same thing... ""The first was the best, and the movies went downhill until this one."" The acting was good the effects were better. However, the twist at the end was a masterpiece I will give it that. No one could have seen that coming.",Jigsaw

I was hoping for a new story hear but, it's just like Saw 2. Seriously? the mega twist is that we are following two different time lines? In Saw 2 everything that happened in the house was just prerecorded, and in Jigsaw everything that happens with Kramer was 10 years ago. In the end this all comes to light and it's supposed to be some big reveal, and it just felt disappointing and lame.Why didn't they use Dr.Gordon in some cool way? Why bring in some new apprentice? Every movie has a new apprentice that comes out of nowhereso weak.Anyways, go see this for free but, don't pay for it.",Jigsaw

333,hr-31390,"Major spoilers, but necessary for my review",6,26 October 2017,"As a saw geek, i thought the film was a good film for an average movie goer, but for a fan of the franchise i found it underwhelming. the ""he had another apprentice all along"" was lazy in my opinion. The idea Elanor was really Cortbett from saw 3 carrying on jigsaws work (she was around 11 yrs old in saw 3, so the age ties in 7 years on) - this would have been a far more inventive and plausible option than some random character that we are told was on the scene long before Hoffman and Amanda is too weak in my opinion. I also think, making you believe Jigsaw is alive again, only to find out it is scenes from 10 years ago is like giving a kid a Christmas present and taking it away again. However clever, leaves you disappointed. Frustrating. I understand the series needed re-inventing for the new audience, but to forget its old fan base and not have any mention at all of Hoffman, Amanda or Dr Gordon is like ordering Chocolate cake and getting trifle. whilst trifle is nice, its not what you wanted. There are certain rules in a saw film that jigsaw sticks too, well so should the producers.. even if those characters aren't appearing, they should have included someone, even if in name only, especially Dr Gordon as he was alive and well only 7yrs ago and would have known about Logan surely. All in all, a decent film. For a saw fan though its a little disappointing",Jigsaw

337,maccers-01256,True SAW fans beware!,2,26 October 2017,"As a massive and avid SAW fan since its inception in 2004, I thought the film overall was pretty poor, which seriously pains me to say in a review. The film is lifeless and had no SAW-like qualities from the previous seven films in it. I totally understand Lionsgate reasoning rebooting the franchise and bringing SAW to the modern world with new characters, new colour palette, direction etc; however as an avid fan I felt robbed of all the hype I had in my own mind and expectation since the film was announced last year.Take nothing away from Charlie Clouser and his soundtrack, once again it is spot on! A very unusual take of the film to begin with, unlike previous instalments, it felt like a TV crime drama was just copied and pasted from a CBS show onto the editing software Kevin Greutert uses; at the time i'm there thinking what the hell is this i'm watching here!100% not scary, jump scares weak. Hardly any gore or that SAW-style visceral piece of storytelling that made the franchise what it is.I understand the reasoning and story behind the traps they produced, but it felt like the writers made them all up in the space of 2 minutes without actually thinking about how to add that violent tension which makes the trap scenes unsettling to watch. To be fair, for me it does have one of the best twists in the franchise... but the ending was very cheap and stingy from a fans point of view. You come to expect that decent climax and the ""wtf"" moment like the previous seven films, but all I saw was nothing but garbage which was truly unsatisfying. The film clearly does not push itself further.I even shook my head slightly when it ended. I dunno, maybe i'm too hung up on the previous story/characters, and maybe I'm gonna have to watch it again to try and reap some benefits. But for me it is one, maybe the worse film in the franchise. Even after the film I kept thinking that I could have done a better job. The Spierig Brothers did an okay job with a very tacky script with only scene that stands out the most.",Jigsaw

Throughout the movie, many plot holes are presented, can be considered a major issue for some horror fans, mostly those who are larger fans of the semi-bloodless, physcological movies of earlier this year. If a viewer allows themselves to look past these, and simply enjoy the premise, they will find it as a solid sequel. Jigsaw is most likely to be enjoyed in the theater by hardcore fans of the saw franchise. Causal fans or general horror aficionados are more likely to benefit from waiting for the movie to be on video, or streaming it in a few months.

The plot twist at the end is cool (not the best) and I did not see it coming. I was kind of disappointed though when I went home. Once in bed I started puzzling all pieces together end I found out the plot was actually pretty good! I liked the movie and it was fun to watch.

An intimidating yet calm voice rings over the intercom explaining why everyone is here and what is expected of you all if you wish to make it out alive. ""I want to play a game"" Is the last thing said by the voice before the unexpected and gruesome first event begins. For avid spectators of the last seven SAW movies, there was a lot of anticipation for this movie. Would they stick to the same formula used for last series, or create something completely new and unique? For those whom have never watched the last seven movies, they may generalize the genre as your standard cheesy horror– gore, gore, and more gore. But when it comes to the last seven SAW movies they are all ingeniously connected with a great level of complexity. The films are packed full of unique story-telling techniques: foreshadow, irony, twists, and turns, constricting time frames, a question of right and wrong and sometimes asking the viewer to challenge their own morality. I was satisfied to see that JIGSAW very much so followed the attributes of the old movies, and to those whom have never seen the last seven movies, rest assured you can still be a viewer and enjoy the complexity this film has to offer along with an understanding of the ""why?""

347,michaeltf,They ran out of ideas and made a disappointing ending,1,15 November 2017,"As a huge fan of the saw movies I felt severely let down by this movie. As Jigsaw is so highly advertised, you expect him to be the mastermind and back completely but expect disappointment. The other movies had trapped characters who had actual personalities that make you want them to live, plot twists they hadn't used before, returning characters from previous movies that you didn't expect and a continuing plot. This movie reused the plot from two previous Saw movies... Jigsaw's apprentice being the mastermind the whole time (Saw IV, Saw VI and Saw VII) and also what was shown to us and everyone had already happened (Saw II).. This was the movie to wrap everything up but had the worst twist out of them all, which hit harder due to the hype I felt believing Jigsaw would be back. One of the main issues I had with this movie is that it was advertised and presented to us to have Jigsaw be the one behind the recent crimes but it wasn't even a returning character like Saw II and Saw VII had.. It was someone who meant nothing to us loyal fans and feels like a slap in the face as the actor of Jigsaw/John Kramer (Tobin Bell) was actually there in the movie so it's not like they couldn't bring him back. Now obviously we saw him die so it would have been difficult to explain him still being alive but they teased us so many times with his return and as this is the supposed official finale advertised with Jigsaw we'd expect an amazing reason, an amazing twist to explain this. We see Jigsaw alive with dialog from another character indicating confusion as to why he is but later on we just get a twist that this part of the movie was set in the past.. I'd have rather been given a movie set at a point where he was alive rather than someone new with no charisma.The actual ""game"" itself.. felt so uncared for with characters so boring and similar. Yes, there are characters we are supposed to hate but not 4/5 of them and the only likable one dies in the middle of the movie. This is supposed to be the main thing in the Saw movies and to have it as as not only end up as a side-plot, but to feel so unenjoyable is very disappointing. One scene in particular that didn't make sense either is that a girl needed to take only 1 of 3 injections with 1 being an antidote to poison inside her another being harmless and another being acid but she refused so another ""player"" injects her with all 3.. ensuring her instant death which didn't make sense because he just needed to use 1 and she would had a possibility of surviving or just not being harmed at that moment. She also knew the answer of which needle it was the antidote the whole time.",Jigsaw

And then this movie came out, and I was excited to see how it would be, despite the previous movie. Until I actually watched this movie. Don't waste your time. This movie throws around the idea that a certain trap in here was created/used before the first movie came out. All Saw fans know this is a ridiculous premise. In the 6th movies (I think) it is revealed that the doctor is assisting Jigsaw. Not a doctor in site here. The movie also doesn't explain how Jigsaw is magically alive after getting his throat cut and the autopsy done on him. Refer back to my comment about a specific trap.. The previous Saw movies would have seamlessly tied all of this together. Not this one. It has nowhere near the amount of crazy genius the previous ones did. Jigsaws traps were not modern.
