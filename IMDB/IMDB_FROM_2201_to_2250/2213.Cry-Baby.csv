0,MartinHafer,"It's a lot of fun, but also perhaps a disappointment for those looking for the John Waters of old",8,26 May 2008,"The late 80s and 90s were an odd time for fans of John Waters films. The oddball director had become mainstream and while the films during this ""normal"" time period were very watchable and fun, compared to the rough and raunchy older films he had made you'd almost think that this was made by a different man. Now I am not complaining--HAIRSPRAY, CRY-BABY and the rest are really good films. It's just that Waters' style changed so much that the films are tough to recognize as his since they lack the offensiveness that many have come to love!! Last night I saw CRY-BABY for the second time. The first time I saw it I was disappointed because I was hoping for a film more like his classics FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER--and at that time I still hadn't seen any of his other mainstream films. However, in seeing it again I realize that although CRY-BABY lacks Divine (he'd died after making HAIRSPRAY) and the crudeness of the earlier Waters films, it is still a heck of a good film. There is a certain energy and silliness about the film that make it better than most other musicals. That's because although this truly is a musical, it's also a parody--being very much over the top and kooky---and I loved this kookiness because it was so much fun.Instead of the 1950s of most films, CRY-BABY is warped. While Johnny Depp seemed almost right out of films like THE WILD ONE, his friends and family were more like guests from THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW than what you'd expect from the era. You know it's a whacked out group when one of the most normal among them is played by Traci Lords (an ex-porn star). I also loved the touches such as the whole disgusting look of Hatchet-Face and one set of parents who are played by David Nelson (from OZZIE AND HARRIET fame) and Patty Hearst (a perennial Waters performer and former SLA member). It's like the 50s on acid and is MUCH more wacky and weird than HAIRSPRAY.If it were all just weirdness, then the film would have very quickly lost my attention. However, the film has exceptional 50s style music that you can't help enjoy and many of the musical numbers are hilarious parodies of other musicals (such as JAILHOUSE ROCK). There is also a certain silly charm about the film that you can't help but love. While it's not quite as good a film as HAIRSPRAY (1988), due in part to some plot holes (why did Polly Bergen change so quickly?) the film is still a fun and entertaining ride.",Cry-Baby
1,bkoganbing,Riding For His Teenage Queen,7,21 January 2009,"After three years of 21 Jump Street, Johnny Depp jumped his contract and got out of the series that made him a name. He knew what he could do and he knew that staying there he probably would continue to be like so many teen idols, forgotten the second their television show completed its run. Ironically though in Cry-Baby written, produced, and directed by John Waters, what was Depp doing, but spoofing the kind of part that brought him TV stardom.He looks like he's having a good old time playing a James Dean type rebel with what he considers a good cause, the love of teen dream Amy Locane. Amy's from the right side of the tracks, raised by her grandmother Polly Bergen whereas Depp as Wade 'Cry-Baby' Walker lives a Tortilla Flat like existence Cry-Baby is yet another one of John Waters's salutes to his childhood memories of the Fifties in Baltimore. If Cry-Baby looks a lot like Grease, well I would say that Waters is homaging outrageously. Though Johnny Depp is dubbed while singing, he manages to create and keep the illusion very well. A nice score both written and interpolated for the film helps bring the Fifties back again.Throughout the cast you'll see a lot of familiar names looking like they're having a real good time in their roles. Former Teen idols like Joey Heatherton, Troy Donahue, and David Nelson really do get into the spirit of Cry-Baby.The inevitable chicken run is the highlight of the film. But the run does have a twist. See Cry-Baby and find out just what that is.",Cry-Baby
2,Leofwine_draca,Perfectly dull,4,5 September 2020,"There's nothing I found particularly interesting in this John Waters film, which is basically a generic and old-fashioned musical in the GREASE mould except without the snazzy, toe-tapping songs that GREASE is famous for. I much preferred Waters' next movie, SERIAL MOM, which is a pitch perfect suburban blacker-than-black comedy. This one is perhaps his most mainstream production, and perhaps that's the problem: it's a kind of bland, play-it-safe kind of movie which is perfectly inoffensive and perfectly dull.",Cry-Baby
3,SnoopyStyle,ridiculous camp but not necessarily funny,6,22 August 2015,"It's the class of '54 in a Baltimore high school. Wade 'Cry-Baby' Walker (Johnny Depp) leads a group of leather wearing outcasts called the drapes. There's his pregnant sister Pepper (Ricki Lake), Mona 'Hatchet Face' Malnorowski, Hatchet Face's boyfriend Milton Hackett, and Wanda Woodward (Traci Lords) who is embarrassed by her nice parents. Allison Vernon-Williams (Amy Locane) is tired of being good and falls in love with Cry-Baby. Her grandmother (Polly Bergen) disapproves. Cry-Baby takes Allison to the drapes' hangout Turkey Point. Both find commonality in being orphans from unusual circumstances. Cry-Baby was raised by his grandparents (Susan Tyrrell, Iggy Pop). Lenora Frigid is obsessed with Cry-Baby and jealous of Allison.John Waters has some fun with this campy take on the 50s teenage rebellion movie. It's kinda cool and Depp is the perfect guy to have all the girls falling for him. Everything is played for camp but it's not actually funny. It's perfect for cult status. Some may laugh at its ridiculousness. I really only laughed at Wanda and her parents. They have a funny kind of dysfunction.",Cry-Baby
4,gavin6942,"A John Waters ""Grease"" Parody?",6,4 February 2014,"In 1950s Baltimore, a bad-boy with a heart of gold (Johnny Depp) wins the love of a good-girl (Amy Locane), whose grandmother (Polly Bergen) smells like moth balls and turkey grease.I like the quirkiness of John Waters and he really has assembled an impressive cast here (catching Depp before he became even bigger). But I just did not get all that attached to the film, primarily because of the singing. I am sure the music that turned me off is the same reason many people love the film, but I just could not get into it.I still think it is worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of Waters, Depp or Ricki Lake. Seeing Amy Locane in a prominent role was cool, and it is a shame she never quite made it to A-list star level (though she made it further than Jill Schoelen).",Cry-Baby
5,lee_eisenberg,John Waters forever!,10,22 March 2006,"No doubt you well know that John Waters does everything possible to trash the rules in his movies. And he sure does here! ""Cry-Baby"" has a familiar plot - a good girl attracted to a hoodlum boy - but everything about the movie is a hoot. Johnny Depp once again shows himself to be possibly the greatest actor of his generation as Wade ""Cry-Baby"" Walker, a ""drape"" who falls for ""square"" Allison Vernon-Williams (Amy Locane). Naturally, her conservative family and acquaintances don't approve of this one bit, so trouble ensues.Probably the funniest scenes in the movie are as follows: an air-head mother (Patty Hearst) tells her daughter to stop and look both ways before crossing the street - this to a girl who prefers to hang out with the ""drapes""; at a ""square"" party, some boys sing the most mind-numbing, idiotic song imaginable (it just goes to show what dorks they are); and the scene in jail, where a cop (Willem Dafoe) makes everyone repeat ""God bless Dwight Eisenhower! God bless Roy Cohn! God bless Richard Nixon!"" - in case anyone had any doubts as to which side the police were on.All in all, this is a movie that's impossible not to like. The truth is, I've never seen a John Waters movie that I didn't like. Just great.",Cry-Baby
6,BA_Harrison,A far cry from Waters' early films.,7,25 November 2017,"Trouble brews in a small Baltimore town when pretty 'square' Alison (Amy Locane) falls for bad-boy 'drape' Cry-Baby (Johnny Depp), so called because of the single tear he sheds every time he does something rotten.Following the success of Hairspray (1988), cult director John Waters continues to flirt with mainstream movie-making with this trailer-trash musical, a gloriously campy effort inspired by '50s rock 'n' roll movies that boasts an extremely colourful cast, including rocker Iggy Pop, ex-porn-star Traci Lords, Waters regular Mink Stole, notorious kidnap victim Patricia Hearst, Warhol acolyte Joe Dallesandro, future chat-show host Ricki Lake, and '50s heart-throb Troy Donahue, plus a small but memorable role for Willem Dafoe.It kinda goes without saying that the film is just as kooky as its collection of off-beat performers suggests, with lots of crazy comedy, a touching love story, and plenty of well-executed musical numbers (Depp and Locane lip-synch—probably not a bad thing—but the songs are great). It's good natured, family friendly fun, that at the same time somehow remains unmistakably 'Waters' (don't worry, though no-one tucks into a freshly laid dog turd in this film).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for the laughing rat and the scared cow.",Cry-Baby
7,moonspinner55,It offers sporadic moments of witty satire and fun nostalgia...,4,7 April 2008,"Cult director John Waters continued his assault on the mainstream with this 1950s tale of a teen rebel with a sensitive side romancing a good girl from the wealthy suburban sect. Think of it as the anti-""Grease"", a trailer-trash variation on an old plot from the Late Late Show. Yet, without engaging characters at its center, the movie isn't as enjoyable as it promises to be (nor is it as loose as Waters' ""Hairspray"" was). Well-cast Johnny Depp does fine in the lead, but his performance is all externals, and Waters showcases him the same way those bland hunks from '50s cinema were used: as a stock pretty boy. On the other hand, Waters' marvelously twisted sense of humor comes through winningly in several spots--the movie practically has to put its thin plot on hold to squeeze in these eccentric bits--and the supporting cast is mostly used very well. Overall, it just misses; the failure to ignite, I would imagine, rests on the director's own screenplay, which needed more punch. ** from ****",Cry-Baby
8,BandSAboutMovies,"If you don't like this movie, rest assured, I hate you",10,25 September 2020,"Somehow, John Waters made the career switch of being infamous to being famous without losing any of his devoted cult audience. And while this movie wasn't the hit that Hairspray was, to me, it's closer to the spirit of what I love from his films.Wade ""Cry-Baby"" Walker (Johnny Depp) leads a gang that includes his sister Pepper (Ricki Lake), Mona ""Hatchet Face"" Malnororwski (Kim McGuire), her man Milton (Darren E. Burrows) and Wanda Woodward (Traci Lords, a vision as always). Cry-Baby is able to cry one single tear while he sings, which drives the girls insane. He's fallen for one of the squares, Allison (Amy Locane) and he's ready to take on the world to prove his love.Cry-Baby and Allison are both orphans. Her parents took separate flights all the time just in case something happened. Well, it did. Both their plans crashed. Cry-Baby's dad was the Alphabet Bomber and even thought our hero's mother tried to stop him, they both went to the chair.Polly Bergin (who my mother-in-law sold turtle oil for, a story which I really need to hear more about) plays Allison's grandmother, while Cry-Baby's guardians are played by Susan Tyrrell and Iggy Pop, which sounds like the perfect parental units.This rockabilly Romeo and Juliet romance is enlivened by the casting that only Waters can get away with, finding roles for Troy Donahue, Mink Stole, Joe Dallesandro, Joey Heatherton, David Nelson and Patty Hearst.While this was being filmed, Traci Lords was being investigated by the FBI. The cast and crew hid her and when she'd get upset, tell them all about the times they'd be in trouble with the law. That warms my heart.",Cry-Baby
9,Coventry,"""Grease"" goes kinky!",7,6 October 2005,"John Waters' movies are perhaps acquired taste (read: first class TRASH!), but ""Cry-Baby"" is a fairly accessible and comical romp, complete with great music, very likable performances and a moody 50's atmosphere. Obviously mocking ""Grease"", the story is set in a Baltimore high school where teen idol Johnny Depp leads the ""Drapes"" thug gang versus the chic and fancy ""Squares"". The hormones work at maximum power and Depp's character inevitably falls for the most popular square-girl in school. Arguments like these can only be settled with rough fights anddance contests! Johnny Depp and Amy Locane are both great in their lead roles, but it's the supportive cast that impresses the most. More particularly ex-porn star Traci Lords, Kim McGuire as Hatchet-Face (you can't but stare at her grimaces), Iggy Pop and Ricky Lake (as Depp's wild sister in a constant state of pregnancy). The gags are more tasteful than usual but all John Waters' trademarks are still present. ""Cry-Baby"" is a strangely sexy film that'll definitely bring a smile on your face. Recommended!",Cry-Baby
10,preppy-3,Lots of good moments but never pulls together,7,30 August 2012,"In 1954 Baltimore bad boy Cry Baby (Johnny Depp) falls for sweet and innocent Allison Vernon-Williams (Amy Locane). She also falls for him to the horror of her mother (Polly Bergen perfectly cast) and her boyfriend who will do anything to get her back.This movie was obviously made to recreate the success of John Waters' earlier film ""Hairspray"" which was a huge hit. It didn't even come close and it's easy to see why. It's not a bad movie at all. It has a great soundtrack and the song and dance numbers are incredible (especially the ones in the prison). The cast is all good. Depp is fun in his first movie; Locane is very sexy; Ricki Lake is having a great time; Traci Lords wisely kids her porn star image. The problem is the script. It's very scattershot and rambles all over the place. It moves around so much I was lost at a few points. The movie never pulls itself together. There are tons of great moment's but it never works as a whole. So--it's worth seeing just for the music numbers alone but it's no ""Hairspray"".",Cry-Baby
11,lastliberal,Our bazooms are our weapons.,9,19 April 2008,"This has to be the funniest send up of those teen musicals that could only come from the imagination of writer/director John Waters (Hairspray, Pecker).Starring Johnny Depp and Amy Locane (Blue Sky, Going All the Way) with a supporting cast that is familiar and fun: Polly Bergen (""Desperate Housewives""), Iggy Pop, Ricki Lake (both Hairsprays), porn queen Traci Lords, Troy Donahue, Willem Dafoe, and many more' with fantastic singing by James Intveld and Rachel Sweet (I have to get this soundtrack!).If you like John Waters and the music of the 50s, then this is a movie that you will not want to miss. Depp and Locane are to die for! Yes, it has some Waters wildness peppered in and that makes it a must-see.",Cry-Baby
12,StevePulaski,I wouldn't call him a cry-baby if I were you,8,11 January 2012,"When I see a film like John Waters' Cry-Baby it almost whispers to me that there should be no such thing as a ""parody movie."" There should only be homages to clichés, genres, and eras. Cry-Baby is an homage to the era of the fifties where greasy hair, tight jeans, leather jackets, and rock 'n' roll was the norm. While not being alive in the fifties but knowing a lot about the lifestyle, culture, and politics of the era, I can say that from my own knowledge it seems like it knows what it's doing.John Waters is a provocative film director, which makes him the perfect, yet unexpected director for a film of this magnitude. It's an odd, yet delightful film that would be misunderstood by a mainstream audience, but a scrumptious bowl of delight to his cult following. For that reason is why it most likely didn't do well at the box office. Like all of Waters' films, it developed a cult following years later, but has always been unfairly compared to his more successful musical Hairspray.Cry-Baby and Hairspray are two different films. Hairspray follows a chubby teenage girl who wants to become a dancer in a town divided by racial segregation. It wasn't trying to pay homage to anything, but was trying to be a fun and energetic musical with a message. Cry-Baby is the exact opposite. It's a film that follows the rebellious rocker Wade ""Cry-Baby"" Walker, played fantastically by Johnny Depp, who occupies a strange ability to cry one single tear from his left eye.This ability woos all the girls, including Alison Vernon-Williams (Locane), a good girl who finally wants to cut loose and shy away from her cutesy image. She wants to join Cry-Baby and his gang of Drapes (a pun on the name ""greaser)."" She herself is a square, taken in by her grandparents after her parents' death. The problem is that she can't totally rely on Cry-Baby because his rebellious lifestyle tends to get him in a lot of trouble.Like a lot of good campy films, there is no real plot. Just very interesting characters. What Cry-Baby is too is a delightful social commentary on new generation trends and the old ones' response on them. Every decade comes with trends; the sixties for their peace, the seventies for their rebellion, the eighties for their wackiness, and the nineties for their laid back style. Each trend receives shocked looks from adults and natural ones from the teens involved in them. Cry-Baby shows how different lifestyles are taken by each generation and then bashed by people who went through that same rebellious state when they were younger. It's hypocritical, sure, but it's natural. After all, we all want the best for our youngins. So we want them to stay away from the rebellious lifestyles. But we also want them to be unique. What a paradox.I'm making the film sound too serious, when in fact, it's subtle in its commentary. It's a high-energy film all around. The musical numbers are catchy and addicting, and the actors do a great job with the material that has been handed to them. Especially Depp who basically tells us ""whatever I act in you'll have to accept."" Cry-Baby floats in a sea of innocence and isn't at all cocky with its material like some films are in the same genre. It simply wants to show us the paradox of generations, a well done character study on multiple different people, a mixture of Elvis films, Grease, and others of the leather jacket-generation, and just a fun musical as well. Its campy style will be disliked by some, questioned by many, but loved by the true cult-cravers.Starring: Johnny Depp, Amy Locane, Susan Tyrrell, Polly Bergen, Iggy Pop, Ricki Lake, Traci Lords, Kim McGuire, Darren E. Burrows, Stephen Mailer, Troy Donahue, Patricia Hearst, and Joey Heatherton. Directed by: John Waters.",Cry-Baby
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,You got it raw!,8,21 May 2010,"John Waters, this guy is one of the quirkiest directors. Almost like a Ed Wood of today, he doesn't care how cheap his movies are, he wants them made. With little films like Pink Flamingos and bigger successes like Hairspray, Waters always delivers in the cult classics. Cry-Baby is no acceptation. With a young Johnny Depp, this movie should have been bigger, but unfortunately got swept under the rug. But it has become a classic to many and I can totally see why as I was charmed by it. I have to admit, from the moment I watched it I absolutely fell in love with this movie. It's so over the top and was meant to be that way, but I love how it doesn't apologize for it. It's a fun satire of the 50's, the greasers, the preppies, the poodle skirts, the bikes, everything. There are songs that are very catchy and a story that is so soap opera-esquire that you can't help but love Cry-Baby as well.In 1954 Baltimore, ""Cry-Baby"" Wade Walker is the leader of a gang of Drapes. His ability to shed a tear drives all the girls wild. One day after school, he is approached by Allison, a pretty girl tired of being a Square, and the two fall in love. Despite Allison's grandmother being skeptical, Allison stays and sings with the Drapes. Allison's jealous square boyfriend Baldwin starts a riot at the local Drape hangout, Turkey Point. Cry-Baby is blamed for the fight and sent to a penitentiary, outraging all his friends and even Allison's grandmother, who is impressed by Cry-Baby's posture, manners and musical talent. As Lenora, a girl with a crush on Cry-Baby but constantly rejected by him, claims to be pregnant with his child, Allison feels betrayed and returns to Baldwin and the Squares. Eventually, Allison is persuaded by the newly-established alliance between the drapes and her grandmother to stand by Cry-Baby and join the campaign for his release.One of the things that I loved about this film is that it seemed like the cast genuinely had a great time making it. Everyone clicked so well, kept the story short and sweet and made it so much fun to watch. There is a scene where Cry-Baby and Allison realize they love each other and start kissing, but as they discover they're both orphans and that's part of their connection, I couldn't help but stop laughing as Cry-Baby continues kissing Allison while she's telling her heart breaking story of how she lost her parents. But then there is a strong storm as lightening strikes a tree branch down and Cry-Baby dramatically screams how his parents were put on the electric chair, was so funny but in some weird way I think this was a strong performance by Depp. At the time he was still only really known for ""21 Jump Street"", trying to break through a teen heart throb image, you can see how he was meant for the strange roles. Waters put his love into this film and it's definitely worth the look, it's a new guilty pleasure of mine. While it's not going to please everyone, depends on your out look on films, I think this was a lot of fun to watch and can't wait to see it again.8/10",Cry-Baby
14,=G=,"Hey Daddy-O, this sucked!",5,24 February 2002,"""Cry-Baby"" is a camp comedy and outrageous parody of everything 50's. With Depp in the title role as a wannabee rock singer from the wrong side of the tracks who falls for a square girl from the right side of the tracks, ""Cry-Baby"" is an intentionally wacky flood of nonsense and caricatures which just doesn't work and that's from someone who can remember Mono, Iron Lungs, the Bunny Hop, Ike, Doo-wop, rumbles, pedal pushers, crew cuts, etc. The film's roster includes some appearances by real 50's heart throbs such as David Nelson and Troy Donahue, bits by Willem Defoe, Polly Bergen, etc., and Traci Lords...did you ever see a good film with Traci Lords?? Passable, forgettable nonsense.",Cry-Baby
15,lasttimeisaw,Cult wizard John Waters' first major studio film,6,26 July 2016,"Cult wizard John Waters' first major studio film at the heels of the moderate success of HAIRSPRAY (1988), CRY-BABY is Johnny Depp's springboard from small screen to silver screen in his salad days.It is 1954 in Baltimore, Wade Walker, aka, Cry-Baby (Depp) is the leader of the ""drapes"" gang, a group of delinquents including the core five, Cry-Baby, his litter sister Pepper (Lake), a chubby teenage mother of two and expecting a third, ""bad girl"" Wanda (the pornography actress Lords), the facially disfigured Gothic-looking Hatchet Face (McGuire) and her boyfriend Milton (Burrows). They form a band and Cry-Baby is the leader singer, aping Elvis Presley with the uproarious rockabilly panache.Pigeonholed in the rebel teen sub-genre, it is a standard bad-boy-good-girl-meet-cute fairy-tale, Cry-Baby brazenly asks out a ""square"" girl, Allison Vernon-Williams (Locane) from the Doo-wop pervaded, orthodox talent show presided by Allison's prudish grandmother (Bergen), and brings her to the Turkish Point, the venue of Drapes' gatherings, run by Cry-Baby's grandmother Ramona (a no-holds-barred Tyrrell, ravishes in French-kissing Iggy Pop and her outré garment, scantly 18- year senior to Depp, at the age of 45, it is plain ageism to place her in the grotesque grandma role).Cry-Baby's provocative action enrages Allison's current square boyfriend Baldwin (Mailer), who marshals a clutch of squares raid the Turkish Point, and a scuffle ensues, which leads to Cry- Baby's imprisonment. After a procession of dashing musical numbers (even the dance-shy Depp shows off his not-so-dazzling routines in the penitentiary) and knockabout adventures, Cry-Baby and Baldwin settles a score in a puerile chicken-race. But the penetrating playfulness retains without sagging until Cry-Baby's trademark single teardrop singularly materialises in the countenances of all and sundry in the finale.In all fairness, CRY-BABY is engaging in the characterisation of the eccentric group's rebellious spirit and the contrast between their unconventional looks and wholesome communal affinities, as a musical, the set pieces can still manage to bring down the house for nostalgic spectators. But it is also undeniable that the acting is camp to the hilt (but the late Tyrrell and Bergen are getting my sympathy votes), a feebly tangible, largely implausible narrative doesn't go anywhere other than off-hand caricature and shallow braggadocio, only Depp holds out by imprinting his personal charisma onto his green but heart-throbbing teen idol image, at the age of 27, he was paving his way to be the most maverick and audacious A-list actor in the 90s on USA soil before eventually bowing to the recruitment from Disney, and being tiresomely tapped as Jack Sparrow, a one-trick- pony who has spawned a lucrative but ebbing franchise.",Cry-Baby
16,Rainey-Dawn,Strange But Cute Musical Comedy,6,8 December 2017,This is one of the oddest high school musical comedy films you'll ever see - even stranger than the Grease movies.Johnny Depp is Cry-baby. Cry-baby claims to be an orphan who's parents where electrocuted and he sheds a single tear for them - and that's all anyone will ever see from him. He's fallen in-love with a 'square' chick who's just as crazy over him. Her (ex)-boyfriend does not like the idea and seeks revenge on Cry-baby.Quite a bit of comedy - some sexy scenes - lots of musical numbers keep this film as a fan favorite.6/10,Cry-Baby
17,Irishchatter,Best movie ever!,9,2 November 2015,"You gotta admit it, you were either shaking around dancing or just sway your head around for the music you hear on this movie. Although you might be aware, Johnny Depp and Amy Locane aren't singing in this which is a total shame because it would've made it more natural! This would definitely remind you of Grease and Hairspray, it is such an inspiring love story that will make you feel like you're in a different universe. Man, it would be better that way any day! You will also laugh at this too. I have to say, my favorite scene was definitely where the rat giggled when he showed Crybaby the wrong way to escape the prison, it was hilarious! There are other scene's as well that were so slapstick!If you loved Grease or Hairspray, you gotta watch this!",Cry-Baby
18,Bored_Dragon,There's nothing the matter with my face. I got character!,10,21 December 2018,"I wanted to see this movie because of Johnny Depp, but when I realized it was made by the author of the unwatchable ""Pink Flamingos"" I almost gave up. Fortunately, these two movies have nothing else in common. ""Cry-Baby"" is comedy musical that parodies movies about juvenile delinquency and teens in the fifties, like ""Grease"" or ""Rebel Without a Cause"". It has an entertaining story, great music, and choreography, and well-developed characters, played by charismatic actors, among which are Johnny Depp, Iggy Pop, Tracy Lords, and Willem Dafoe. A film that will never get old.10/10",Cry-Baby
19,Rodrigo_Amaro,I Was Crying With Both Eyes.,2,18 April 2010,"Yes, I really meant that. I was really crying with both eyes, something very different that occurs with Johnny Depp's character is this movie: he can only cry with one eye. And I really must say this: This movie ruined what was a happy Sunday. It's bad.In ""Cry-Baby"" Depp plays the title character, an charming juvenile delinquent that wants to date the girl of his dreams, Allison (Amy Locane) a rich girl. But this is the 1950's and they are part of different social groups. He's a poor rebel and she's a pretty good girl that only walks along with rich boys. She likes Cry-Baby and follows him into several adventures. In the middle of that we have oldies Goldie's music and annoying characters such as Hatchet-Face (Kim McGuire, she scared me the whole movie), the pregnant Cry-Baby's sister (Ricki Lake) and many others.I expected to see something similar to ""Grease"" or ""American Graffitti"" but it has nothing to do with both movies. It may be the same period, it may have the same clothes and that stuff in the hair but it's something really boring, unfunny, unpleasant, pointless and no sense of direction. And the songs played here plays all the time making this movie very sickening. No one is safe here. Johnny Depp, OK he's good looking here but he doesn't have a good performance here, and he's dubbing the songs. Same thing happened with Amy Locane. Most absurd than that is the fact that Iggy Pop (he's good actor here) doesn't sing in the movie and Willem Dafoe was diminished in a cameo. What was John Waters thinking when he made this movie? Other thing that bothers me is people saying that this is one of the best movies of all time, claiming that this is a masterpiece. My friends and enemies I'll say this: If you think that ""Cry-Baby"" is a cinema masterpiece then you don't know what movies are and not even had the chance to see a great movie with a substantial plot. But you always have the chance to learn. Don't watch it no matter how beautiful is the boys and girls in this wreck. Most of all don't waste time and money, I waste my time so that other people don't waste theirs. Thumbs Down for this!",Cry-Baby
20,Dr_Coulardeau,There is something joyfully perverse in this film,10,26 April 2014,"A small and funny film shot in the late 1980s (1989-1990), at the end of Reagan's era and in the middle of George Bush Senior's regency, has no pretension except to debunk everything and everyone and make fun of a system that is as crooked as it is full of bigotry. A remake of the Mods and the Rockers, of the Jets and the Sharks, the Montague and the Capulet, American sauce on top and whip cream to top it off and kick it up. But this multiple remake is so overloaded with clichés and prejudices that it becomes hilarious and the objective is to make us laugh at those biases and other preconceived ideas about the other group, since the whole world is nothing but A versus B.At the same time the film debunks fake education based on square ideas being the best in the world, on some clean type of dressing being the only decent, godlike and non-obscene way of dressing, all the rest, jeans and everything else, being nothing but homosexual showing off especially for girls who are supposed to wear decent dresses.You add a love story in that viper nest and you have a real Romeo and a genuine Juliet. But the world must have changed because the judge is falling in love with Juliet's grandmother and he becomes sentimental and releases Romeo, alias Cry Baby. I must admit that the prison break is definitely as good as all those we were able to examine and/or supervise in the eponymous TV series. And do not forget that the best way to get out of trouble is to follow the rat. Rats are best to get out of the way, out of trouble and back to home security, I do not mean the security of your home.The film is fabulous as for the music of the late 1950s, actually dated thanks to the evening prayer in the very special school for boys where the ""boys"" are supposed to thank Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. That's cool indeed. Be it only for the music the film is worth its eighty-two minutes, but the ""dancing"" and the performance of the actors, particularly the very young Johnny Depp is refreshing in this world where everything is nothing but special effect and make believe.An excellent piece of dialogue alluding to the famous Unabomber who was definitely literate and had been active in the bombing business since 1978 at the time when the film was made.Cry-Baby: That's right, Allison. My father was the ""Alphabet Bomber."" He may have been crazy, but he was my pop. Only one I ever had. Allison: God. I heard about the Alphabet Bomber. Bombs exploding in the... in the airport and barber shop... Cry-Baby: That's right. All in alphabetical order. Car wash... drug store... I used to lay in my crib and hear him scream in his sleep...""A,B,C,D,E,F,G... BOOM! BOOM!"" Allison: But your mom... Cry-Baby: My mother tried to stop him.

21,southdavid,Penal Reform,7,30 July 2020,"An idle browsing session on Netflix had us land on ""Cry-baby"", a film that'd I'd heard of but didn't really know much about. Though I could see the flaws with the film, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.in 1950's Baltimore, tensions are rising between the squares (affluent preppie types) and the drapes (poor rockabilly delinquent types). Crossing the divide Romeo and Juliet style are Allison Vernon-Williams (Amy Locane) and Cry-baby (Johnny Depp), whose love is blooming despite their differences and the scepticism or loathing of both sets of friends and families. The test in their relationship comes when Cry-baby is thrown in juvenile prison, following a gang fight.""Cry-baby"" is a musical comedy, parodying the Elvis films of the 60's, although to today's audience I'm sure it feels more like ""Grease""s campy weirder brother. Performances are much more over the top and brassy, despite a cast including Depp in his first starring role, Ricki Lake, Iggy Pop and Willem Defoe in a small role. The film really belongs to two other actresses though. Traci Lords, who's hard faced practical Wanda is great whenever she appears - and the fearless Kim McGuire, whose Hatchet-Face is the most memorable thing about the whole film.You do have to know what you're getting yourself in to. It's a John Waters' film after all and you're required to just go with it quite a few times and to get in tune with his sensibilities and sense of humour. It comes at the expense of both subtlety, but also in this case plot, which can charitably be described as muddled. You can see why the massive performances, and tunes lend themselves to turning the film into a theatre musical though (which must be due for a revival when theatres are allowed to open again. )It's a fun time, provided you get it.",Cry-Baby

25,strong-122-478885,Goo-Goo! Ga-Ga!.... It's Time For Cry-Baby!,1,23 July 2014,"At this point in time (1990), after John Waters has now been a film director for 20 years, I still find his overall approach to film-making to be that of a childish amateur.Cry-Baby's story was so annoyingly erratic, frenzied and hyper-active throughout, that I swear it was directed by someone who didn't have a helluva clue as to what they were doing.With its story set in Waters' own hometown of Baltimore (in 1954) - Here Waters seemed to gleefully portray all of this town's citizens as being thoroughly unlikable (be they from the wrong side of the tracks, or not). And, with that, I'm quite convinced that he must totally loathe Baltimore (where he grew up) with a venomous passion.Waters' obvious distaste for women was also quite apparent in this film, as well. I got the clear impression (through Waters' depictions of women) that the only female worth anything was your standardized, boy-toy slut.Even ""good girl"" Allison was inevitably reduced to this slutty level, before long.Far from being a fond, nostalgic look back at the early 1950s, Cry-Baby's mean-minded story was chock full of malice, spite and vicious mockery (all in the name of amusement, of course).From what I gathered by the very limited personality-types who prevailed in the story, Waters was making it crystal-clear to me that he thought the only real ""cool"" people were stark-raving arseholes (like himself, I guess).With its completely unfunny, white-trash mentality, its non-stop over-acting, and its uninspired & badly-staged musical numbers, I was quite pleased to read that upon its initial, 1990 release, Cry-Baby flopped at the box-office, big-time. (Hooray for that!) And, finally - When it came down to Depp's tiresome, pretty-boy role as this film's title character (yawn!), in my opinion, it was a blah sort of performance that wasn't even worth any special notice.",Cry-Baby
26,estebangonzalez10,Energetic and fun spoof of 50's jailbreak Elvis films,7,21 September 2015,"""No, she's a scrape - part square, part drape. I think she's pretty.""Johnny Depp was on his way to becoming typecast as a teen idol when in 1990 he was given the opportunity to play two odd roles. One was his first collaboration with Tim Burton in Edward Scissorhands which remains one of his most iconic characters to date, and the other an often forgotten and overlooked musical comedy directed by the eccentric John Waters. This was my introduction to his particular brand of filmmaking and I had a fun time with it. Clocking in at under 75 minutes the film knows when the humor is running out of steam and manages to end before the novelty begins to wear down. The movie is a parody of 50's teen rebel films and it spoofs musicals like Grease. The only thing I knew about Waters before going into this film was the remake I had seen of his original musical, Hairspray. I now can see why he has a cult following since his style isn't conventional and the experience is a unique one. It's Johnny Depp who carries the film with his charm and good looks making fun of our conception of the cool rebel character, which in a way is the way audiences conceive the actor in real life. The characters in this film seem to be having so much fun that the ridiculous and over the top parody is simply contagious. It's so energetic and playful that it's hard not to watch it with a smile on your face. Johnny Depp plays the titular character, Cry-Baby, who is called that because of his capability of shedding a single tear from his left eye that drives the girls crazy. He's a bad boy who loves fast paced cars and hangs around the cool group known as the Drapes. The sweet girl in his school who falls for him is Allison Vernon (Amy Locane). She's a square because she belongs to the traditional side of town who are very much against the drape lifestyle and culture. Allison is tired of being the good girl and she eventually wins Cry-Baby's heart who introduces her to his circle of friends: Wanda (Traci Lords), Pepper (Ricki Lake) who already has two children and is pregnant with the third, Hatchet-Face (Kim McGuire) and her boyfriend Milton (Darren E. Burrows). Even though Cry-Baby is part of the drape culture he is more polite than the rest of his gang and eventually they all accept Allison as one of their own. Her boyfriend, Baldwin (Stephen Mailer), however isn't too happy that Allison is hanging out with these bad boys and decides to give them a lesson. Meanwhile, one of Cry-Baby's many admirers is Lenora (Kim Webb), who isn't happy Allison is hanging around the man she loves, and she too will do what it takes to keep them apart even if it means making up a story that she's pregnant with his baby. The musical is very energetic and a lot of fun. There are several memorable scenes including a jailbreak attempt that is hilarious. Locane and Depp have irresistible charm together and they seem to have had a fun time working together with this offbeat comedy written by Waters himself. There are also some catchy songs with decent choreography including Doin' Time For Bein' Young, Please, Mr. Jailer, and Teardrops Are Falling. The 50's soundtrack is just so much fun and enhances the musical's energy even more. John Waters also included a hilarious orphanage scene where the children were displayed like animals in a zoo. The character of Hatchet Face probably evoked the most laughs with her crazy look and there's a hilarious scene in which she pops out of a movie screen while the prisoners were watching a 3D horror movie and they all jumped out of their seats horrified by her look. There is also a cameo from Willem Dafoe as a prison guard that evoked some chuckles as well. The predictable premise of the film could've turned this into a familiar bore, but Waters knows how to come up with innovative and fresh ideas with his unique brand of humor. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Cry-Baby
27,dwpollar,Corny Waters-like comedy musical...,4,8 May 2009,"1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience. John Waters directed this music-filled spoof of the fifties scene with Johnny Depp playing the title role. This movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled ""Hairspray"" but this one is not as effective. Some of the tunes are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky Waters-like way, and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone. The storyline is similar to the movie ""Grease"", where there is a good group and a bad group. The guy from the bad group, Cry Baby, wow's a girl from the good group. The good girl then joins the bad group but once Cry Baby hurts her -- she falls back to the good group. This just sets up the ending where Cry Baby tries to win her back. Now, one difference that is expected in Water's movies is that the bad group doesn't appear all that bad all the time and the good group acts like they have a pole up their you-know-what. I definitely saw this in Hairspray, as well. The wacky and goofiness isn't really all that much fun in this movie, though and it just leaves us with a feeling like the movie could have been much better. The prime appeal of the Johnny Depp character is that he's able to make one tear roll down his cheek(thus his namesake) at various times and makes the women fall all over the place for him. This is overused and the basic bottom line is that the movie is OK, but not that great.",Cry-Baby
28,Cristi_Ciopron,Join the mayhem,5,8 April 2009,"As usually in these teenage comedies, the conventionally nicer girls are not the ones favored by the script. Here, Depp is surrounded by a couple of women (you want to know who they are—well, I thought abound the spicy blonde in the gang and about Depp's stalker) nicer than the one picked by him—yet it is of rule of the melodramas that the conventionally less appealing girl is the one chosen by the bum.Hughes made this vastly silly and enjoyable, wholly pointless parody, mayhem, romp; indeed it is more of a parody than a pastiche. It's funny, silly, harmless, and reminds one of Depp's very low and humble beginnings in the cinema—unfortunately, he had to begin by this silly way, with Freddy Krueger and the drapes and GILBERT GRAPE and the like—man, the mere things he was reduced to—and suddenly there he was, rescued by Burton and let us mention Kusturica as well, and Brando and hanging out with Rourke . Yea, Depp put aside all dignity and got these less than honorable first jobs. Depp went a long way from Crybaby to Ed Wood and then to Abberline. Hughes' comic means are of course cheap and crass, and this seems the entire point of the pointlessness—to delight in the silly rubbish.Apart from any conceivable reasons, Hughes made this comedy in order to kick some ass. It's a mindless graffiti of gross humor and silly ironies, a mayhem of vulgarity and offensiveness; the bland parents of the cute blonde, before the judge, are very cute—when the mother asks about the meaning of a four—lettered word, etc..

The casting is perfect, right down to the extras, some so handsome it is clear there was some handpicked friends of this sharp eyed gay director who got a gig.

33,nycritic,"The 50s, Re-visited and Parodied.",8,9 May 2005,"Following the mainstream success of 1988's HAIRSPRAY -- now a Broadway and nation-wide smash hit -- John Waters returned to give us CRY BABY, a movie which spoofs movies such as REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and JAILHOUSE ROCK with his trademark quirks and a great cast. In this story, set in 1954 Baltimore right at the cusp of rock 'n roll, the squares, preppy college types, are set against the drapes, who are more aggressive edgy, a threat to good mores and values. In a typical Romeo and Juliet setting, do-good Allison (Amy Locane) feels attracted to bad boy Wade ""Cry-Baby"" Walker who carries a perpetual tear sliding down his face due to the execution of his parents. This of course infuriates her stern grandmother, Mrs. Vernon-Williams, who would rather she marry equally do-gooder Baldwin (Stephen Mailer), who is so milquetoast he might as well be invisible to Allison, but who isn't above a few tricks of his own to prove the drapes wrong. At the same time, there is another girl, Lenora Frigid, who is also in love with Cry-Baby and will go to lurid lengths to make him his.Lovingly nostalgic with splashes of cartoonish satire, Waters in his usual fashion explores the values of the misfits and the casual hypocrisies of those considered elite and creates a energetic musical film in a time when musicals were all but dead. That he also manages to accommodate enough screen time for his wide cast which includes figures such as Susan Tyrell, Polly Bergen, Iggy Pop, Traci Lords, Rikki Lake, Willem Dafoe, among others, is quite a feat considering its rather short length shows he knows his material and knows how much he has to give his characters so his story can maintain its frenzied pace. It's one of his best which recreates a time when values were still a lot less complicated than they are now, but which mirror us today and our own views on who's in and out in our own society and how little has really changed then and now.",Cry-Baby

Suitably outrageous performances complement Waters' kitschy, cartoonish sensibilities, but as is also typical of the director's work, the film lacks story momentum and throws in poorly-developed (and quickly forgotten) appendage episodes, resulting in a humorously rollicking but uneven experience.59/100",Cry-Baby

This Kind Of Genius Could Only Happen Here.,10,21 July 2010,"to quote Sinclair Lewis, ""it couldn't happen here"". probably to the horror and chagrin of the ultra-conservatives of the past, this is what American entertainment has metamorphosed into. this is a unique kind of entertainment that, lets face it, like or not, could only happen in America.a lot of people probably think a film like this, from the legendary king of shock, schlock and filth, John Waters, is evidence of the decline in values and standards and represents a disturbing trend. maybe, maybe not. i think it's America getting funny about itself. not to mention a pretty good representation of 1950's American history ( i know because i own a lot of educational and defense films from that period on DVD).this movie proceeds to put absolutely everything about America, people, existence even, under intense scrutiny. it's approach is completely satirical, scathing and merciless. through all this tearing down of not just America, but pretty much life in general, comes a strange and funny(Hilarious) sort of enlightenment. i don't know if Mr. Waters intended it or not, but this film helps any viewer with an open mind to transcend existence. you must learn to laugh at yourself and others,your ups and downs. in other words you need to ""get over yourself"". even with all the bad things that can happen you can't always take life too seriously. 'Crybaby' can help you do this. it really can.i could go into all the reasons why 'Crybaby' is great cinema. it's flawless color and photography, it's attention to details, it's inspired performances, tight editing(great all around technically really), but i think what is most interesting that it is total, absolute, Americana. the situations of the time period, events, are all things that pretty much were indicative of this country. it's a film that only could have come from America(i mean hello.Baltimore,Md), and it's insights and perspectives could only have come from one of our own. and even though this movie is deeply and uniquely American, it rivals any artsy, intellectual, foreign film, any day in terms of sophistication and controversy.i don't always like John Waters' movies. John Waters is the evil spider monkey who gave us cinema atrocities like 'Pink Flamingos', 'Female Trouble',the horrifying and disturbing 'Desperate Living'. i do not endorse or recommend those films to any half-way sane person. after viewing those films most people wouldn't be too out of line if they called their local police department or wrote a complaint to their congressman. those films are wAAAy too shocking and filthy for my taste. i mean they are total works of filthy perversion(omigod can you say 'Sade'). people who watch those movies and approve of them, more than likely have a criminal record or are up to something bad.'Crybaby', and it's sibling film 'Hairspray', are not like those films at all. it's almost like they were made by a different person. sure 'Crybaby' and 'Hairspray' can be a little shocking at times, but they are satire, so they are no more intense than a 'Mad' magazine or a 'Saturday Night Live' comedy sketch. in fact, minor shock value aside, 'Crybaby' and 'Hairspray' are pretty much G-rated entertainments. it's all good, clean, innocent, fun. not something you would expect from a trouble-maker like Waters.look. i like old Disney movies and Shirley Temple and stuff. if a cream-puff like myself can lighten up and laugh at stuff like this, ANYBODY CAN. so, LIGHTEN UP America! there's a lot bad, but there's a lot good and a lot of life can be funny.

Watch for Rock Icon Iggy Pop and 50's torch singer Polly Bergen in small (but delicious) roles.This big budget effort still has ""Pink Flamingos"" and ""Female Trouble"" written all over it.

It's always great to see Iggy Pop, Traci Lords, and Depp, but after the first third of the film it trails into lala-land.A 5 out of 10. Best performance = the chick who played hatchet-face.

There are the rich people like club and the poorer people who just love the dance and hang out with each other. For most of the movie the mother for the rich club people doesn't like who her daughter likes but by the end she might have changed her mind. The character, characters development, plot, storyline and music were all really good in this movie. The two main characters had great chemistry and there romance was great too. This story it the whole opposite attracted and they can love each other, it also was just becuse we are from two differnce social groups doesn't mean we can't be together. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",Cry-Baby
48,samhill5215,One giant grin...,8,24 November 2010,"John Waters has outdone himself with this one. I knew going in I'd like it having seen others of his works and besides I pretty much like most of the talent. Johnny Depp is among my top favorites and as far as I'm concerned he elevates any film with his talent. But what surprised me was how much fun 'Cry-baby' was. Like I said - one giant grin from beginning to end. The music is fantastic, the singing is fantastic, the acting, the scenery, the dialog, all of it -- fantastic! Who knew? Johnny Depp can sing, Iggy Pop can dance, and as for Amy Locane, what a surprise! Not only can she dance and sing but she can act too. Another standout is Traci Lords who must certainly silence her critics with her performance.The movie does go dark midway and I guess Waters couldn't help inject some social commentary when after the drapes and the squares rumble in the park the former go to jail while the latter go free. That dampens the initial jubilant and care-free mood considerably but I guess this conflict was necessary in order to make the resolution more fulfilling. Or I guess that's how Waters saw it. In any case the singing and dancing just goes on and it's all just fantastic!",Cry-Baby

50,onnanob2,Snazzy and fun musical-comedy with John Waters' style.,9,1 August 2005,"Don't expect to watch a movie in the style of ""Grease"" when you watch ""Cry-Baby."" This is a John Waters musical-comedy, and it's full of his style and humor. John Waters has his own style of directing, and his own style for writing dialogue. The dialogue and acting are usually out of the mainstream norm, and viewers who are not familiar with John Waters may not enjoy his films unless they open their minds to possibilities of silly, ridiculous, vulgar, and campy humor. ""Cry-Baby"" is set in the 1950's, and it's mainly about two groups of people who don't accept each other: The drapes and the squares. The drapes don't have a lot of money, are more accepting to different types of people, and listen to the hep sounds of rhythm and blues and rockabilly. Some of them get involved with crime, and are juvenile delinquents. The squares are very conservative, have more money, more attitude, and listen to ""your hit parade"" music. The drapes will hang out with anyone as long as there's a good time to be had, and the squares only socialize with other squares. There is friction and disgust whenever the two types meet. Within this is a love story concerning Cry-Baby and Allison. Cry-Baby is a drape, and Allison is a square tired of being so conservative. Cry-Baby and Allison are attracted to each other, and Allison decides to associate with the drapes. Conflicts emerge, and drapes and squares clash. That sounds clichéd, but the movie has a lot of humor and atmosphere. It's also full of color, spirit, and fun music. The locations and sets create a 1950's atmosphere of small town and rural America. The cars, clothing, and hairstyles are also effective. Sometimes clothes, hairstyles, props, and sets are exaggerated and outrageous, but these are trademarks of John Waters' style and sense of humor. ""Cry-Baby"" has its charm, and is effective as both a comedy and a musical. The musical numbers are fun and lively, and a lot of care went into making the songs sound authentic to the period. They are also well choreographed. Some of the musical numbers were written for the movie, and a few songs were originally 1950's hits newly recorded for ""Cry-Baby"" (such as the song that opens the movie, Allison singing ""Teenage Prayer,"" etc.) There are also original vintage recordings throughout the movie (my favorite is ""Jungle Drums,"" by Earl Bostic, which really gives a summer feeling to the Turkey Point location.) The background score is also well done, and professionally orchestrated. This is a John Waters film, and you have to expect unusual characters, and unusual acting and dialogue delivery. The casting of the movie is an interesting mix of performers (another Waters' trademark), and very much a delight. The cast is terrific! Johnny Depp and Amy Locane are wonderful as the teenagers who are attracted to each other, but live in different worlds. Their pairing brings out a believable chemistry, and a sense of fun. Polly Bergen's performance is excellent as the extremely conservative matriarch who finally learns how to have a good time with people who are different. Susan Tyrrell is as offbeat as she can be (see her in the bizarre musical-comedy ""Forbidden Zone""), and Iggy Pop is interesting in his role. Ricki Lake returns in her second John Waters movie as Cry-Baby's pregnant sister. Kim McGuire, Darren E. Burrows, and Traci Lords create fun characters who are in Cry-Baby's gang and music group. Kim McGuire has a knack for creating a character who's kookie and bold, and yet deserves sympathy at times. Traci Lords is very good at comedy, and it would be nice to see her in more comedies. She does a great job with her mostly-cranky, tough-girl character. Stephen Mailer does a fine job of creating a character you really learn to loathe. ""Cry-Baby"" also features small parts played by noted stars such as Troy Donahue, Joe Dallesandro, Joey Heatherton, David Nelson, Willem Dafoe, and John Waters regular Mink Stole. Patricia Hearst Makes her feature film debut, and is very amusing as the naive mother of a drape daughter. ""Cry-Baby"" was a lot of fun to watch on the big screen, and I'm again enjoying it since it's been released on DVD (with added scenes that were cut for its theatrical release.) ""Cry-Baby"" is a snazzy and fun musical-comedy that seems to be pleasing people who are not regular John Waters fans! By the way, I was a scrape (part square, part drape) in high school, but that's a different story from a different era.",Cry-Baby
51,CaressofSteel75,John Waters Goes Commercial,7,5 February 2017,"It's the classic American social confrontation (borrowed from Animal house and others). Here it's the drapes versus the squares- rock & race music versus the conservative letterman sweater crowd. Cry Baby is a good introduction to John Waters who had to tone down his usual visual mayhem for a big time commercial release. If you're new to John Waters, try this one before you go on to something like Pink flamingos (although I will say that some people should probably never see Pink Flamingos.) It's a decent musical. Jim Intveld did all of Depp's vocals, and he's pretty well known in the hepcat rockabilly circles because of this. In fact, I do believe that this movie helped bring about the rockabilly resurgence that started in the '90s. A lot of good rockabilly & psychobilly bands started to appear after this movie came out.",Cry-Baby

I wish they had produced the Cry-Baby' movie as it really was in the fifties. The best part was the group imitating the Crew Cuts doing 'Sh-Boom.' They should have included Johnnie Ray because he was the original 'Cry' baby.The movie also had its' obligatory negroid, ala 'Little Richard.' This film is set in Baltimore when I was a teen living in suburban Milwaukee. We didn't have blacks in our grade or high schools. There were no middle schools; they were called 'junior highs.' There was as much or more promiscuity as there is today. Kids usually met by telling another, passing notes like 'I want to meet him/her.' This was networking in the fifties. After junior high my parents transferred me to a Lutheran high school and the girls kept their legs crossed. There were more virgins than in a large convent.'American Graffiti' was more typical of teen life in the fifties but that was set in California. The TV show 'Happy Days' was set in Milwaukee and was the truest to form as the 'Moments I Remember' (Four Lads).",Cry-Baby

Joe plays Milton's Father, Milton is one of the gang members from the Drapes. Joe Is only in two scenes, and only a few speaking lines. One of them being in the court room when His son Milton is being charged, Dressed as a preacher, holding a cross and bible he yells out to the Judge that he's been praying so much they've been having headaches, when his wife starts to shake ""You see that your Honor? She's speaking in tongues. God's in her gullet!"". Before that there is a scene outside of the Drapes clubhouse with Joe yelling thorough a megaphone, preaching to his son and his friends as they walk by, saying ""Imagine our shame: our only child and he carries illegal weapons, drives fast cars, and wears clothes obviously designed by homosexuals!"".

57,ipswich-2,Fun to watch!,6,15 May 2000,Slightly funny and musically entertaining movie that has Johnny Depp (not that well known then) as a delinquent who falls in love with a girl who wants to be bad.

Great cameo appearances by a host of stars makes this movie a joy to watch!,Cry-Baby
58,sublime501,Painful.,3,17 July 2004,"CRY-BABY is the story of a hoodlum named... Cry-Baby (Johnny Depp) who is your typical stereotype of bad news. He hangs out with his group of friends, whom are called the ""Drapes,"" and has clashes with the other, rich group, called the ""Squares."" One day, he sees a Square named Allison (Amy Locane) and decides to pursue her. Of course, this causes a big controversy, as two people so different should not be together. Will the love that surfaces between them in their first (and only) night hold them together?Oy... I really don't know what to say about CRY-BABY, other than that it is a painful movie to watch. I guess I'll get the flaws out of the way first, since there are more of them. The story is incredibly overdone and has been done much, much better. It's full of stereotypes and almost forces you to root for Johnny Depp's character--even though, by the end, I wasn't rooting for anybody. The ""jokes"" (aka, the things that are supposed to be funny, if this movie confused that meaning for you) are hardly ever chuckle-worthy, and most of the humor is crude and even disgusting. Case in point: the French-kissing scene. It starts out kind of funny at how ludicrous it is, but quickly becomes disgusting and unnecessary. The screenplay is so ridiculous and full of cliches that it's hard not to cringe or roll your eyes at every other line. And, to top it off--the acting is terrible. It was so bad that it almost seemed like it was being done intentionally; and if it was, that should have been made clearer. If this movie was a parody on bad old movies--fine. I'd like it a lot more. But I don't think it is. It's just trying to be one of them.The good? Well, Johnny Depp has his moments and shows some hints of the greatness to come, but even he is awful in this movie. (He looks absolutely gorgeous though! Wow! I would watch the movie again on mute just to see him, but unfortunately the tracking on the tape I rented is so bad that I can't.) It's fun to see Johnny so young and so long ago, and it's kind of amusing to see Ricki Lake pregnant as Cry-Baby's sister Pepper. And I do have to say that the musical scenes were very good and very well-done, even if it wasn't really them singing. But, on that note--when the hell did this become a musical?Ultimately, CRY-BABY would never be thought of today if Johnny Depp hadn't starred in it. It has great musical scenes, but God-awful everything else. It was literally painful to watch and I couldn't wait for it to end. It's almost worth it to see Johnny lip-synching, dancing, and impersonating Elvis though... almost. 3/10.",Cry-Baby
59,sixtwentysix,A delinquent musical Joy-Ride with 50's teen angst films...,9,23 April 2004,"This is a film that John Waters created as a loving send up of 1950's teen and juvenile delinquent films. It tells the story of Cry-Baby (Depp) a teenage orphan with the ability to make women swoon by shedding a single tear. It's a good natured, never mean musical based in a world where a song can make jail prisoners dance and riot or make someone fall in love with you despite being from different worlds. A cast that includes Iggy Pop, Traci Lords, Waters regular Rikki Lake and a few other pleasant treats and cameos. The actors appear to be having as much fun with the subject matter as the film is. Borrowing for value from films such as Grease, Jail-house Rock, High School Hellcats, Rebel without a cause and a zillion others from the genre this film is a self-aware campy comedy that is very well crafted.Clean and ridiculous warmhearted fun with more than a hint of trash. As of the date I re-watched this film (April 2004 10 years later) this film is still out of print. The reason for that is inexplicable to me as it's one of Johnny Depp's funniest performances and one of the better musicals that comes to mind. Oh yeah, don't blink or you'll miss Willem Defoe as the prison guard. ""God bless Dwight D. Eisenhower, God bless Roy Cohn...""Come for the comedy, stay for the great songs.",Cry-Baby
60,Diego_rjc,What were they thinking!??,3,24 January 2010,"Johnny Deep took the part in 'Cry-Baby' after finishing the TV series '21 Jump Street'. He decided to do it to get away from the reputation of a teenage idol and to be recognized as a real actor. We all know today that he is, indeed, a great and real actor, but back in 1990 it seems like he did the wrong choice. The basic premise of this movie is to spoof those teenage musicals there are set in the 1950's. That's why the plot looks a lot like 'Grease' - rebel teenager falls in love with a 'square' girl. Using this extremely, possibly because they wanted, cliché plot this movie tries really hard to make funny jokes, but it just can't. I only laughed because how bad it was, because it isn't really funny. The whole movie I was with my hand in my face due to my indignation. One particular really weird thing is that in the middle of the movie, they decided to turn into a musical - and were able to provide the audience with the worst musical numbers I've ever seen. The acting here is, literally a joke. I know it was on purpose, but they try too much to seem forced, and it gets more ridiculous than spoof funny. John Waters also does a horrible job directing. The rest is all ridiculous, in every single aspect.But it's not all bad. There are a few really funny moments, like the scene of the orphanage and the court scene, but these moments are rare. In most part, this movie doesn't accomplished what they tried to - be a funny spoof. And I also can't believe that Jim Abrahams is involved with this. I already putted a reminder on my desk - Never to watch a John Waters' picture again.2,5/10, but I round up to a 3 because I'm (really) nice.",Cry-Baby
61,donlhumphries,Enjoyable musical comedy,8,24 May 2002,"If you like plenty of good songs in a movie, then this is for you.  It's a film by John Waters about teenagers: ""squares"" and ""delinquents"", though who are really (or always) goodies or baddies is not so obvious.  As with a typical John Waters' movie, it has a satirical edge and somewhat exaggerated characters, but is all good fun.  The ever-versatile Johnny Depp is Wade 'Cry Baby' Walker, who has the ability to shed a single tear, which sends the girls wild.  He is no sook, but is leader of the delinquents, and falls for rich 'square' Allison (Amy Locane), and she for him.  This complicates his life somewhat.... People seem to either love or hate this film; but don't get too serious about it; just sit back and watch.  If you like the satirical nature of this movie, then try also another John Waters' classic: ""Serial Mom"".",Cry-Baby
62,the-jerk,John Waters' best movie,10,1 November 2005,"""Cry-Baby"" has most of the subversive charm of Waters's early movies with very few of the gag-worthy scenes (like, for example, drag queen Divine eating dogpoo, and that's only the tip of the iceberg). Don't get me wrong, I enjoy watching his early movies, largely because of the audacity with which he tried to gross you out. But since he joined the studio system I do think his movies got better, as they should have because he could afford a much larger budget and better actors. Johnny Depp, of course, didn't become a marquee name until some time after this came out -- he was previously best known for his role on the TV show ""21 Jump Street"" and had also played Nancy's boyfriend in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" -- but afterwards he exploded, and I wonder if it's partly because of his role in this movie. On the other hand, John Waters is so far from mainstream, that's hard to imagine, but you have to give Depp credit for his performance in this; he's always taken quirky, far-from-mainstream parts, and this is where it all began. He's so successful here I wish he'd do a reunion movie with Waters as the two go together so well.""Cry-Baby"" takes place in Baltimore during the 50s and concerns itself with two opposing segments of society: the squares, who are the clean-cut types, and the drapes, who are juvenile delinquent types. Wade ""Cry-Baby"" Walker (Depp) is the latter, and Allison, played by Amy Locane is a square, but she's kind of a square peg in her community; she's smitten on sight with Cry-Baby, and is tired of being good (she's a ""scrape"", as a character later says). And so we have the set-up for the story -- Allison runs off from the squares to join Cry-Baby at a music show he's putting on, which ignites a war between the squares and the drapes. One of the clever things about this set-up is that we rarely see Cry-Baby and his gang doing anything illegal -- at one point, he bumps into Mrs. Vernon-Williams' car (she's Allison's grandmother and a leader of the square community, played by Polly Bergen), and there's a definite air of obnoxiousness about them, but that's really about it. The squares, by contrast, seem like the bad kids; Allison's boyfriend punches Cry-Baby unprovoked when he goes to pick her up, they destroy property when they get to Cry-Baby's show to teach him a lesson, etc. It's one of those ""Who's really the bad guy?"" situations. All of this leads to a great courtroom scene that helps set up the central conflict of the third act, with Allison not sure which path she wants to go down, and Cry-Baby locked up in reform school.The cast is hilarious. You have Johnny Depp and Amy Locane in the lead roles, and they're both great. And you also have Ricki Lake who is very entertaining as Pepper, Cry-Baby's pregnant sister; she has one of the funniest lines in ""The first thing a Cry-Baby girl learns is, our bazooms are our weapons."" Then there's former under-age porn star Traci Lords, who plays Wanda. She puts in a genuinely funny performance here that belies her less-than-stellar past, and has many of the best scenes (she was also good in Waters's ""Serial Mom""). Rounding out the Cry-Baby gang are Kim Maguire as Hatchet-Face, who's aptly named (every facial expression she puts on is worth a laugh, and she manages to be both hard-edged and sympathetic), and Darren Burrows (who would later star in ""Northern Exposure"") as Milton. Susan Tyrrell and Iggy Pop play Cry-Baby's aunt and uncle. Also watch out for Patricia Hearst and David Nelson (Ozzie's son) as Wanda's straight-laced, square-like parents (the courtroom scene involving Wanda and her parents is the funniest scene in the movie), Troy Donahue and Mink Stole(who, like Hearst, is a Waters regular) as Hatchet-Face's parents, Joey Heatherton and Joe Dallesandro as Milton's bible-thumping parents, and Willem Dafoe as a guard at the reform school.What will happen to Cry-Baby and his gang? Will Allison go back to her square ways, or become a permanent member of Cry-Baby's gang? I can only recommend you watch the movie if you haven't yet to find out. All in all, ""Cry-Baby"" is good, only slightly dirty fun, obviously inspired by both 50s teenage delinquent movies like ""Rebel Without a Cause"" as well as any number of 50s rock and roll musical movies, with a lot of slapstick and a lot of funny dialogue and a lot of good music. And despite its less subversive leanings, it is a John Waters movie through and through. This is one of my favorite movies, and I've really only scratched the surface of why.",Cry-Baby
63,JWBly,What a waste of Johnny Depp's talent.,2,23 March 2008,"Swing and a miss for John Waters. This follow-up to his mildly successful effort ""Hairspray"" falls flat on it's face. What a waste of a young Johnny Depp's talent! Water's forces his cast to overact to a ridiculous degree for comic camp value, but the effect is more painful than funny. Depp's strength is his natural ability to flow into each character he plays, so the forced camp in this film is all the more tragic. Only in his first two dance numbers does his natural talent shine through, albeit briefly. Although he does not actually sing the songs during the performances, his dancing and movement are as close to natural for him as you will see in this film. No 50's stereotype is overlooked here. This film feels far more like a bad theme-park version of the 1950's, complete with one-dimensional characters and a hackneyed plot. The catchy soundtrack at least makes the film tolerable for a time. Former SLA terrorist Patty Hearst is good for a couple of chuckles in her cameo, as is porn star Traci Lords as her daughter. Ricki Lake, at the zenith of her weight problem, is wasted in a throwaway role. Actually, except for seeing Depp in his pre-megastar days, the entire movie should be thrown away. Thank God it was only an hour and 15 minutes long. It seemed much longer.",Cry-Baby
64,Idolprincess,Don't expect Grease.,8,16 June 2004,"If you're a fan of the rockabilly fashion of the 50's and of John Waters, you will like this movie. Personally, I was a big fan of it. It's one of my favorite movies.This movie involves two groups: the ""squares"" and the ""greasers"". While most teen movies set in the 50's involve typical preppy high school students, this one was on the side of the greasers. This is what I found fun and interesting. The world in which the greasers live is fun and colorful. The characters are all social outcasts or ""delinquents"" as they call them in the movie. This is what is so particular. Maybe this isn't what life in the 50's was really about, but it gives the illusions that you're seeing an aspect of life during that time that you normally don't see. It was a pleasant and fun to watch movie. It was also very cartoony, which is something I like in a movie very much. The imagery is very pleasant. However, it's not a movie for everyone. It can easily be seen as cheesy. And if you're expecting a typical 50's musical like Grease, there's a good chance you won't like this one, since it makes you root so much for the social outcasts. This movie doesn't show the typical ""clean"" 50's that people enjoy so much. This movie also makes fun of the typical ""bad boy"" image of the 50's. But doesn't it also poke fun at the image that Johnny Depp had at the time? In several interviews done after the release of this movie, Depp mentioned that he enjoyed playing that role because it was a satire of the image he had and that he also disliked very much. I think this is the type of movie that can easily become someone's favorite but that can be hated by a lot of viewers. Maybe the dancing and the singing isn't as good as in Grease. But you have to remember that this is a light and fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously. It can also be seen as a satire of typical musicals. I would definitely recommend it.",Cry-Baby

68,dolly_the_ye-ye_bird,"""You've made me the happiest juvenile delinquent in Baltimore...""",9,12 September 2011,"First and foremost, this is a spot on parody of 1950's juvenile delinquent films. If you've never seen any of the old movies it's making fun of...or if you just don't get satire...then you may not like Cry Baby. But if you're fan of Rebel Without a Cause, The Wild One, The Deliquents, etc...well, then you simply shouldn't miss this film.Wade 'Cry Baby' Walker is the bad boy who is, in reality, not so bad. He has a soft side and is in love with the squeaky clean good girl, Allison. Their affair causes a rift between the two social factions of Baltimore, the rich kid 'Squares' and the cool kid 'Drapes'. The characters are way over the top, the dialog is oh so clichéd....and that's what makes it fantastic! The soundtrack doesn't hurt either! Just like Waters' Hairspray, the soundtrack is almost a lead character itself. Even the choreographed, production numbers (which is something I'd normally hate) are extremely enjoyable because they're such obvious jabs at Elvis movie song sequences.The cast of this film is just amazing. Johnny Depp is supremo hot and Amy Locane is great considering she was only 19 and just starting her career. Iggy Pop is PERFECT and absolutely adorable as Uncle Belvedere. Ricky Lake, Traci Lords and the rest of the 'gang' are a hoot! And of course there's Patty Hearst, Willem Defoe, and the legendary Polly Bergen and lovely Joey Heatherton (you'll find her unrecognizable as Milton's sourpuss, bible thumping mother!) The best thing about the cast though, was the inclusion of some of the actual old teen stars from the '50s in cameos: David Nelson, Troy Donahue. Fun script, fun cast...just FUN all around! 9/10",Cry-Baby

I read all the reviews a few weeks ago and seem to remember a few mentions of the homo-erotic content of the film. I may be wrong but this has mysteriously disappeared from the site. The fact remains, however, that the homo-erotic content is unmistakable. What about the eminently desirable slim hipped male players. Johnny Depp has a universal appeal. All the world seems to be in love with him, male or female. Only a handful of actors seem to have this attribute. To my mind the females were a bit of the fleshy type and strangely devoid of sex appeal. Grimaced or very pregnant. I have no intention of seeming nasty but in my opinion this film would be nothing without the adorable Mr. Depp. Sorry folks.",Cry-Baby

I smiled almost every minute of the movie, because everything was so funny, very lovely and hot! Actors and actresses were acting perfectly. I don't have any rebukes. Soundtracks were very musical, vivacious and hilarious. Plot was very easy to watch, very soft, but also very intense at the same time. 10 points for soundtracks. 10 points for actors and actresses. 10 points for director, who created this amazing film. I love these ages, times which are shown in ""Cry-baby"". I couldn't take my eyes from the computer. To be honest, the plot was a little bit banal, but never mind. It's normal, it's a comedy. It's a musical! Hard to believe that acting is very hard and not easy job, because actors and actresses played fantastic and very easy. They weren't who they are, they were characters, they lived like characters. I want to say that they are very strong and they worth to be in Hollywood. One of the best films I have ever watched.",Cry-Baby
75,larisse,rock it!,8,2 March 2005,"I read somewhere that John Waters hates rock'n'roll, but of course this film gives just opposite thoughts. Exaggeration and idealism, and total madness. Of course the characters are far from beauty standards and thus remind real people, of course some of them can be found unbearably irritating, of course everything going on is grotesque but nevertheless the film is really charming. The songs are just great, the plot is silly, with an obvious happy end, everybody are happy, and i want to get to the fifties immediately because i was born too late and have a very vague idea about this time - based mainly on films like this one... Why do they film all this?:))",Cry-Baby
76,FrangipaniMozzie,Good cult classic which falls short of its goal,6,23 June 2012,"'Cry-Baby' is good film, up there with 'Grease', 'American Graffiti' and other films which depict teenage high-school life, cliques and the pop culture, fashions and music of the 1950s. 'Cry-Baby' is a good attempt to parody the romance of good girls and greasers as seen in 'Grease' and films with a similar focus. However, I do use the word 'attempt' strongly here. The film suffers from a lack of well developed satirical jokes and parody of 50s high school movies and if more time and thought had been put into it, it could have so much better. The other main failing of the film in my opinion is that the plot is too awkward and rushed: I don't think Alison's grandmother could have let her hang out with greasers so easily and the sequence of the prison sentences and the conclusion goes way to quickly to make the film satisfying. The characters are also somewhat one dimensional and more scenes to let us get acquainted with them and show the tensions i.e. Alison and her grandmother and Alison and her square singer boyfriend would have made the film so much more enjoyable and believable. If more scenes had been filmed to cover these elements and the final release was about 2 hours, the whole movie would have been so much better. However, aside from that, I do re-watch this frequently and it is still very entertaining.",Cry-Baby
77,richardv-johnson,"Greetin's, Granny-o",10,23 November 2005,"Ricki Lake has the best lines in this best of all John Waters films (Serial Mom is a close second). Without the yuck-factor of Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, and Desperate Living (no Divine, no Edie) and also without the schmaltz of Hairspray (uncool enough to become a Broadway Musical), Cry-Baby is a brilliant and delicious tribute to early rock-n-roll. Johnny Depp's musical performance, part Elvis, part Buddy Holly, part Jerry Lee Lewis, is amazing. Amy Locane's makeover from square to drape far outdoes Olivia Newton-John's parallel transformation in Grease. Costumes and cinematography are splendid. Plenty of laugh-out-loud lines and sight gags (the epidemic of French-kissing at Turkey Creek, for example). How wonderful that Mona AKA Hatchet-Face plays raunchy saxophone in Cry-Baby's band! I may never wear that gray-and-white-striped seersucker jacket again, Alison's square boyfriend Baldwin is such a complete jerk. Warhol superstar Joe Dallesandro as an evangelist, Polly Bergen as the outraged square grandmother greeted above, Iggy Pop as Cry-Baby's step-grandfather, plus Patty Hearst, Mink Stole, Troy Donahue. Best writing of any Waters film, by far.",Cry-Baby
78,chocolatewtch7,What can you say about a movie like cry-baby?,9,2 September 2008,"First, the bad: This was kind of a stupid movie. The only good parts were the parts with Johnny Depp. It was sad that he didn't do his own singing. (He was in a band for crying out loud!) Now, The good: While the movie was stupid, the plot made sense. I only saw the last 40 minutes and I knew exactly what was going on. Another (really) good part was this: Johnny Depp's pants rip off. Who doesn't want to see that? ;-) All things considered though, I would have to say that, this isn't one of Johnny Depp's better movies. It was good. It's just not up there with Findin Neverland or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or something like that. Keep in mind though, I haven't seen many Johnny Depp movies. OK. That's enough for this review.",Cry-Baby
79,Crystal-Allyn,Good movie - but not for everyone,7,6 April 2005,"This movie shows a ridiculously inaccurate view of the fifties, it is cheesy, every line is completely over-acted, and at times it is simply idiotic - all of the quirks I mentioned are what makes this film unique and hilarious. The TV was created for entertainment - if a person were to watch Cry Baby with an over analytical mind set they would be sadly disappointed, but if you enjoy the greaser-square feuds or people bursting into song - then this the perfect movie to watch. Cry Baby isn't nearly as eloquent as Grease, if you're looking for something similar you won't find it here - but frankly, I enjoy Cry Baby much more.",Cry-Baby

After i saw this movie i said i love Johnny Depp and now i know everything about him . I like how this movie kind of takes place on a Grease setting because i love Grease. I love the part in this movie were he is at turkey point and he sings King Cry-Baby. But i love all the songs because they are all really cool. When i first saw the movie i had to take three looks before i realized that cry-baby walker was Johnny Depp the first two words out of my mouth were HE'S HOT.

81,lvgoold,Cheesy but nonetheless still BRILLIANT!,8,14 May 2007,"I had never heard of ""Cry Baby"" until I watched ""The 100 Greatest Musicals"" and it raced in at no. 90. The clip shown was Allison, standing on the car bonnet belting out ""Please, Mr Jailer"" - for me now, still one of many memorable moments. Is it the fifties costumes, the rockabilly soundtrack even the tongue-in-cheek choreography, I'm not sure, but it all contributes well to the film's 'musical genre' appeal and still manages to set itself apart from the others, such as Grease.In terms of visual appeal, I really like the use of vibrant colours of the drapes; red lipstick, black leather jackets and trousers and the outlandish hair styles! Catchy tunes abound, too. Days after viewing they just wouldn't leave me alone; chorus lines endlessly repeating in my head. Having since purchased the film and the soundtrack I can now get properly acquainted with the verses.I would definitely recommend ""Cry Baby"" to those who enjoy lively musicals, particularly, the 50's, and a young-ish Johnny Depp - in a likable role but (disappointingly) he's lip-syncing the songs over the music.",Cry-Baby

Not before or since have I seen such a terrible piece of filmic waste spewed upon the screen. There is nothing positive I can say about this film. Acting--awful; plot--ridiculous; music--atrocious. Following the movie, my friends and I demanded our money back from the manager of the theater.

It's a total goof-ball, over-the-top comedy about the 50's, with great rock 'n' roll song and dance sequences. Johnny Depp is amazing in any role he plays, but this has to be one of my favorites. Depp, the bad ass rebel greaser from the wrong side of the tracks finds he has a soft side for the goody-goody square, Amy Locane. Locane is sick of being uptight and wants to be bad for once in her life.This movie gives you gangs fights like in West Side Story, the good-girl wants bad-boy like in Grease, great songs and dancing like in both movies, but with it's own great cheesy twist. You've got teen delinquents vs. goody-goodys, gang rumbles, jail time, lies, heartbreak and then of course, a happy ending. All of the people that commented about how Cry-Baby was trying, but failed to be like Grease or Elvis' movies, blah, blah, blah, need to see this movie again.

I thought it was hilarious and we laughed through the whole thing. We both thought it was basically a much better version of Grease. We were a little concerned, though, because we were not quite sure if it was supposed to be funny or serious. The story sounds kind of depressing. A poor, low-class boy who cries all the time and whose parents were executed falls in love with a rich, high-class girl whose parents died in a plane crash. It was, however, hilarious, and the scariest, most dramatic part of the movie was when they were going to cut Cry-baby's hair, which I thought was thoroughly terrifying.

Mmm mmm...17 years later I still get chills watching that scene because of how freakin' fine he is. I finally got the soundtrack yesterday off of Amazon.com and it is truly a great soundtrack.

94,ARRGH!,Gotta love any film that pairs Iggy Pop with Susan Tyrell,8,27 October 1998,"This is probably John Waters' most underrated movie. It's the 1950's and good girl Alison Vernon-Williams (Amy Locane)is ""tired of being good"". She wants to hang with the Drapes (Baltimore slang for greasers) and be a bad girl. Only problem is, she's living in the world of the Squares. She has a Square boyfriend (Baldwin, played by Stephen Mailer), an upper middle-class square life, and her grandmother (Polly Bergen) is the head of the moral upper class (their motto is the 4 ""B""s, ""Beauty, Brains, Breeding, Bounty""; an actual real life phrase from Waters' grandmother). What's a young Debutante to do but fall for the town's most notorious juvenile deliquent, ""Cry Baby"" Walker (Johnny Depp).While not nearly as disgusting or offensive as his other films (Hell, it even makes Hairspray seem subversive), this film struck a chord with me more than any other of his films. It's an authentic throwback to the Jukebox Musicals of the 1950's and early 1960's. Everyone in the cast is in on the joke and the performances are jubilant. There are tons of authentic 1950's songs to be found, both originals and lip-synched by the principals (Vocals done by Rachel Sweet, James Intveld and Timothy B. Schmitt).Johnny Depp finds his footing quickly in the role of a teen-age idol deliquent that all of the girls want and all of the guys hate. He's actually spoofing his then ""21 Jump Street"" Tiger Beat pin up image. I must say that up until this movie, I didn't like Johnny Depp. His sense of humor and self effacing performance changed me forever and I've been a fan ever since.The rest of the cast includes Ricky Lake (Before she lost the weight and any shred of credibility due to her sleazy talk show), Traci Lords, Susan Tyrell, Iggy Pop, Patty Hearst, David Nelson, Troy Donahue, Joe Dellasandro, Joey Heatherton... in fact Waters comes real close to realising his dream of having an entire cast of stars, both as leads and secondary actors.The theatrical version runs 86 minutes and is tampered with by the studio with cuts and re-shoots. Sometimes, though, USA network runs the uncut version with cut scenes, alternate scenes , and and extra song, ""Chicken"", originally done by Burt Convy(!). This is a much funnier and coherent version and should be looked for by fans of this film.Scenes to watch out for include the Turkey Point make-out sequence, the aborted Jailbreak by Hatchet Face (wonderfully played in true Dreamland style by Kim McGuire) and Milton (Darren E. Burrows), and ALL of the musical performances (it's impossible to choose just one).If you dig Jukebox Rock-n-Roll movies (and if you don't.. you're a SQUARE!!!!), you need to see this one.",Cry-Baby
95,Stryder-6,THIS IS THE FILM TO SEE FOR THE HOPELESS ROMANTIC WHO BELIEVES LOVE WILL CONQUER ALL.,10,19 July 1999,"THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE AND EXCELLENT FILM.I found the plot to be extremely believable. That a poor individual can inspire true love in a debutante or higher on the social scale's. I am also positive that the debutante could fall totally in love with the Cry Baby. She was right not to pick the geek guy. But unlike the movies, real live often has it where the female must make the ultimate gesture of communication and action to bring the Cry Baby fully into her life. For the reason he is a Cry Baby is because he truly loves her, and therefore finds that to love so deeply, he must do things that might even cause his own downfall so as to protect and defend and try to guarantee her current and future happiness, even to the point of never having her.  Which is more unbearable than ones sanity can handle; so eventually, every female is the one the Cry Baby loves.  And so he cry's because all he knows is he truly loves and he is always alone. Luckily the writing on this film was excellent and emotionally well portrayed. The actors and actress's in the film made the story totally believable and thoroughly enjoyable to the point of rooting for the happy ending. NOT JUST WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN.!I found the short cameo appearances of  Patricia Hearst to be some of the most enjoyable if  not some of the shortest segments.  Her ability to express emotion and character thoughts and feelings on screen, along  with a growing ability for fine craftsmanship and performance in the acting profession; should stand as a inspiration to all women to aspire for quality.LOVE THE ORIGINAL CRY BABY,  BLUE CARD OF INTRODUCTION AND BLACK PENMANSHIP; C..J.G.

Anyway, the next best of John Waters' stuff, down the line, are Serial Mom, Desperate Living, and Female Trouble. Forget Pink Flamingos and Pecker (although they are good too).

As a lover of old musicals from the 50s and 60s, it's just amusing to watch a spoof of them, especially one done so well as this. My fav scene (don't worry..no spoilers..) is one where Crybaby (JD) performs a song in a comedic Elvis Presley fashion, which shows how dynamic JD is as an actor. what else makes this movie great? The music. There's not one boring song where you feel like it'll never end, because you don't want it to end. (yes, i own the soundtrack..i'm pathetic, i know).

Yes, there are a few laughs, but it is so not-worth-it! It is interesting to note how many talented actors are in this; thus making it sadder still -- such a waste of talent. The idea behind the movie is funny, but the screen-play could have used a few more re-writes and the director ought to have paid closer attention to the fact that the audience would be made to suffer through the boredom of watching the same grotesquely over-used facial expression and hearing the same flat delivery for a variety of stupid lines. I know this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously, but it goes far beyond being just good farcical fun and ends up being a dreadful waste of film. Anyone who tells you this is a great movie is not to be trusted; their taste is obviously highly questionable.",Cry-Baby
108,rayzerramon,Laugh 'til you cry,6,7 December 2005,"My wife and I were recently in Holland and relaxing in our hotel room prior to flying out the following day.We were ""surfing"" through the channels and happened to come upon this movie just as it was starting. We sat mesmerized and were able to watch it in English (with Dutch sub-titles).It was so off the wall. I was drawn in by its'""cartoony"" absurd take-off on the old ""surf and drag"" flicks from the 50's and 60's.The character ""Hatchet-Face"" reminded me of a female version of ""Eric von Zipper"" from the Frankie/Annette movies.Once you take it for what it was intended to be, it's a lot funnier to watch.My favorite part was when ""Hatchet"" bursts through the movie screen while the in-mates are watching a 3D version of ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"". I fell off the bed from laughing so hard.This definitely launched Johnnie Depp on his ""quirky"" movie roles.Funny stuff!",Cry-Baby
109,drama-queen-3119,Great movie!!!,10,14 June 2007,"This is such an amazing movie!!! To be honest, the reason I decided to watch it was because Johnny Depp is in it...and it only made me love him more!!! It's funny, different, and strange the way only Johnny Depp could make a movie. He and Amy Locane have such great chemistry throughout it, and the rest of the cast does a wonderful job. I expected it to be just as weird as it turned out to be (as all of Johnny Depp's movies tend to be, which is why I love them!), and I enjoyed it immensely. I'd definitely recommend it if you like 50s movies...and want to watch something that I found to be like a very, very weird version of Grease.",Cry-Baby
110,the head,the second greatest movie of all time,10,14 August 1999,"considering that this is a john waters movie it shows considerable restraint in dealing with the 'teen angst' theme. it does , of course, draw on the great 50's teen movies and can be seen as a continuation of the 'blackboard jungle' riff. however it is the funniest musical comedy ever made. and is so with full cognisance. this goes some way to redeeming genre affiliation. some of the musical episodes, i am thinking of 'life could be a dream' in particular, are so well crafted that one wonders why waters hasnt made many more first rate movies.",Cry-Baby
111,Collectonian,Awesome Movie Finally Gets the DVD Release It Deserves!,9,22 July 2005,"This is one of my favorite movies and its arrival on DVD has had me excited for months! The DVD version is awesome with 6 minutes of extra footage and some nice features including commentary and a ""Making of"" featurette. The video quality is good and the audio is great, with the scenes with music obviously having some updating because the singing sounds more powerful than in the video version. The extra footage is great too. I just love this movie and have probably watched it 30 times or more. I can almost quote it line for line, yet it still never fails to make me laugh like crazy and sing along with the music. About the only thing I wish is that there was a scene with Allison kicking Lenora's psycho butt. LOL.I highly recommend getting the DVD version now that its available. In addition to having scenes added to the movie, it also has deleted scenes available in the extras (including some rather disturbing ones with Toe Joe and Wanda; and most of which were better off out of the movie). If you already have the VHS version, give it to a friend and convert them to the Cry-Baby fandum. :-D And don't forget the soundtrack so you can sing along in the car!",Cry-Baby

When I first saw it- I was worried- it seemed a little to tacky for me but then I really got into this movie and started yellig at screen when something happened I didn't like and I cheered at the good bits and now I even sing to the songs and cry at the emotional bits. With its regular humour and catchy tunes this movie is incredibly gripping- you will find yourself wanting to watch it over and over again IF you are open minded enough to enjoy it and not pick up on its rare bad parts. Johnny Depp is immense in this and is totally as sweet as sugar. You will his single lonely tear drop almost as much as his Elvis style dancing! Watch this film- it's great really!",Cry-Baby
114,tessiwilson,The most fantastic movie ever made!!! Don't take it seriously guys!,10,11 July 2006,"This is an exceptional movie but you have to have a sense of humor to enjoy it. John Waters is a genius and you have to understand this genius it is first class trash at its best!. The rockabilly soundtrack and greaser costumes are brilliant. It is Johnny Depp at his finest and Traci Lords is brilliant as Wanda. The characters are so brilliantly cast that it will be hard to forget them as any other. An absolute must see for any Johnny fan as this is hi best role out of many fine performances. Check out William Dufroe cameo as the jail warden. Ricki Lake is fabulous as Pepper and Iggy Pop is hilarious as Uncle Bellvedere. If you enjoyed Hairspray of A Dirty Shame I can guarantee you will enjoy this movie. This movie is going to be a classic an should not be missed, Campy, Trashy and ""John Waters"" brilliant.",Cry-Baby

So anyone who hasn't seen this movie I recommend you go to a video store, rent it, and watch it!!!! my favorite part is when cry-baby takes Allison to meet all of his friends, and then Hatchet face, Wanda, and Pepper change her into some HOTT clothes, put her hair down , and smother it with hairspray, put some fire engine red lipstick on her, and send her out on the stage with cry-baby , and they sing together.... the only thing I don't like is that it is not me up there with him., I get so jealous. But like I said it is a great movie and you all have got to see it!!!!",Cry-Baby

OK well since i already asked my question here's a poem by Charles Bukowski! ""There is enough treachery, hatred, violence, absurdity in the average human being to supply any given army on any give day. and the best at murder are those who preach against it. and the best at hate are those who preach love and the best at war-finally-are those who preach peace. those who preach god need god those who preach peace do not have peace. those who have love do not have love beware the preachers beware the knowers..""

118,filmloverrd,trailer is more fun than movie,5,16 June 2021,"Firstly I watched it because Johnny Depp was in it. He's performance was stunning it was so fun watching him as Cry Baby. Also I liked the character. He's punk, crazy, wild and unflinching. But I am thankful to god he didn't let this character get stuck on him because he is handsome and attractive.Although the movie made some laughs, overall it was painful to watch because of there was a lot of foolishness. I know it's not a movie to be taken seriously. But that was too sloopy I think. The costumes and make-ups of the side characters made my eyes bled. Maybe it was enough for 90's but I watched it in 2021 and it's like 'why am I watching this?'.. I gave up halfway through the movie. Then I came here and read the user reviews and I decided to give it a chance. I watched it till the end it's not too long tho. I liked the dance scenes and musicals was good too. But I can not understand what is that the people who gave 10 see but I didn't. I think it does not deserve more than 5 points.",Cry-Baby
119,MoonSafari,Just plain bad,1,25 July 2003,"This movie was terrible.  The acting was lame, but it's hard to tell if someone was acting well since the writing was so bad.

Anyway about the movie it is a great story about love and the life or a teenage boy named Wade or Cry-Baby Walker. I don't want to tell you the ending. But it does have some laughs and maybe even a tear or two. Anyway If you haven't seen this movie get up go to Blockbuster and rent it now!!!! I promise you will love it!!!!

122,kirbienstien,Movie failed to establish what it was.,3,3 January 2011,"I watched this movie not knowing it was a comedy, I found some of the actions and mannerism very awkward because the movie wasn't establishing itself as a comedy in the first scenes and if it did, I didn't find it funny. The sound effects for the movie are hit an miss and finally show you that the movie is a comedy/satire of old 50s musicals. The movie really turns around 1/3 of the way through and I just didn't like it. A lot of people think this movie shows how diverse Johnny Depp is but I think it shows how reliant he is on costumes and makeup effects to be a different character his performance was nothing to write home about.",Cry-Baby

124,SavvySparrow,Light hearted fun,8,8 August 2003,"I saw this movie when it first came out and I absolutely loved it! I was fortunate enough to have some pay channels at the time and I must have watched it 20 times or more and it never got old. I don't do that often. Only a hand full of movies have made the 'repeated viewing' list with me. Those being, Grease, Cry Baby, Tombstone, Two Towers, Sleepy Hollow, Fear and Loathing and now Pirates of the Caribbean. So yes I definately say it's a keeper! Of course Johnny Depp is beautiful eye candy and I never tire of looking at him but, he's so much more than that. I recognized that immediately when I saw him in this movie. I said then, that he would go far with his acting ability and be more than just a pretty face and He has never disappointed me. This movie is not supposed to have deep meaning to it, it's a spoof. So if your looking for a movie that ultimately leaves you with some deep hidden meaning or message, your not gonna find it here. It's just meant to be silly and fun, while 'making fun' of the time it was set in. It holds up just fine. The acting is very well done and the scenes that were meant to be sexy, were very sexy. Anyone who has seen this and said it sucked just doesn't know how to let go and have fun and need to lighten up a little. We have enough serious crap in life to deal with. It's nice to let it all go once in awhile and be 'stupid silly'. I just went out and bought it yesterday and I'm so glad I did. I've watched it twice already and I think I love it even more now because it made me feel young and alive again and because as I watch him now I can say, see? I knew he was special, even then and now look at what he's become! Johnny Depp is truly amazing and anything he does he gives his all to. This is no exception. So to all you nay sayers, non believers and critics who gave him such a hard time... A big ol' raspberry right back atcha!!!",Cry-Baby
125,yayformeh419,Johnny Depp comedy,10,27 February 2004,"I thought this movie was very unique and comical. I loved seeing Johnny Depp in one of his early roles. I have seen all of Depp's movies and this is by far one of the most fun. This film both made me laugh and swoon(of course) over Johnny's interpretation of a troubled teen-idol.This movie was full of so much enthusaism and great acting that I have been trying to find it on DVD. I even though the songs, though rather cheesy, were a lot of fun. With interesting dual performances byIggy-Pop and Ricki Lake as the hilarious Pepper, This movie got a ""10"" from me.If you are looking for a more light-hearted and clever film starring Johnny Depp, rent Cry-baby today!",Cry-Baby
126,erin_eggleton,What an awesome thing!!,10,10 August 2004,"OMG!!! I thought Cry-Baby was such a dumb movie, the plot anyway, but the singing and Johnny Depp and the comedy was great!! It was like a cheaper form of Greece and with hotter people!! Wow! This movie is for comedy lovers and people who can use an hour and a half to have a little fun. But I would recommend that you see it with a group of friends or family...it's that kind of movie!Cry-Baby has a lot of familiar people like Ricki Lake (has her own show) Johnny Depp (obvious) Iggy Pop (band member) and Traci Lords (porn star). All these people together produced a very happy and interesting, although could be categorized as over-dramatic film. Wait to go!!",Cry-Baby
127,kisstwiggy,This is my favorite movie ever!,10,22 May 2004,"This is my favorite of all time. I am such a huge fan of John Waters. He is so awesome and out there. This movie made me fall in love with Johnny Depp. I love Amy Locane also. I like to watch them together. They have good chemistry. This movie is so funny and weird in a good way. I would totally recommend it to anyone who likes films about 1950s culture completely exaggerated. It is great though. My favorite part is when Allison sings ""Please Mr. Jailer"", it is a good song and a funny part. Traci Lords is great in the movie also, Patty Hearst plays her mother. She is hilarious. They all are great actors and I think this movie really shows it. It may be a comedy, but it is a love story and you will fall in love with Wade ""Cry-baby"" Walker and Allison Vernon-Williams. It is a great movie!",Cry-Baby
128,michellica91,Cry Baby is sooooo sweet!,9,25 June 2004,"I loved cry baby when i saw. I love Johnny Depp and he plays a fantastic part. The musical scenes are awesome especially when cry baby himself sings ""king Cry Baby"" and alison sings ""Please Mr Jailman"". It's a wonderful film with johnny depp looking HOTTER than ever! Fantastic for a laugh too!!!!!! My rating for this film was 10/10 because i thought it had a good plot, good actors (especially Johnny) and different to the now movies that are around. It's sweet and romantic and the singing involved makes a MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I insisted everyone see it, i'm sure you'll love it too!!!!! And also i just can't stop singing Please Mr Jailman won't you let my man go free.........!",Cry-Baby

130,sabbie202005,Great movie,10,26 January 2005,"This movie is one of the best movies that Johnny Depp starred in besides Edward Scissorhands and Pirates Of The Caribbean. He's such a great actor and has so much potential. He gets right in depth with his roles. I love him!!!! He still looks great for being 41! I love it in this movie when he's in jail and his ""girl"" starts singing ""Please Mr. Jailer"" That's one of my favorite songs. I also love seeing him ride that motorcycle. He's one of the best actors out there in this world today and he deserves to get so many awards for his acting career don't you think? So, what is everyone's favorite song and part in the movie? My favorite song is ""Please Mr Jailer"" and my favorite part is when him and his girl finally hook up in the end.",Cry-Baby
131,trentsagod2me,JD is hot of course!,10,14 February 2005,"I love this movie filled with hot people, hot comedy and hot music.It's a feel positive movie involving struggle for love good dancing and directing.One of my fav. older films.It made me laugh cry smile and feel good. All around a nice Grease like film. I do like it better tho,more my style.I like when the baby pops out of Ricky Lake all clean in the back of the car during the street race of chicken,then the squares crash into a barn of chickens.That's really laughable! I also enjoyed the singin jailbirds scene.Most of I enjoy all of Depps films, he has great choice is style as well.Tracy Lords also I enjoyed she reminds me of all the wannabes nowadays trying so hard to look like her and be retro and the Betty Page wannabes.",Cry-Baby
132,admiller-2,Great Movie,9,16 April 2005,"I have watched this movie, hundreds of times, and it never gets boring. The toe tapping music and plot is extremely comical, which makes it easy for the viewer to enjoy it. With many diverse characters and locations, it always keeps the audience on their toes. Johnny Depp, is a very lovable character, yet still is able to retain his ""bad boy"" image. The costumes and visuals make the viewer pay attention to the actors and places when necessary, and yet hides them when it is not of great importance. The notion that Crybaby can cry one tear and have girls falling all over him, is a new and inventive way to show emotions, yet make the character still seem real.",Cry-Baby
133,ambernapesis,about my choice,10,25 August 2005,"well what to say other than the fact that i really love this movie it is a great well put together movie. I've seen this movie over 250 times and i will watch it 250 more because its a movie that I won't get tired of, and of course the characters help to so i would suggest to at least check it out. It may be a little corny but that is what i think that i like about this movie I use to wake up three hours early for school just to watch it before i left and i still own the movie. its a good children's movie too my children love to watch it mainly because of the music i think but that is OK because the music is good to. so in a couple of words i think that this movie rocks.",Cry-Baby
134,bedhead75,I love this movie!,8,9 June 2005,"I had mixed feelings about this movie at first. I didn't hate it, but it didn't rank real high on my list of favorites, either. But apparently, it had an effect, because I spent the next three weeks rocking out to ""Please, Mr. Jailer"". I still can't escape that song. I love Johnny Depp because he adds these little tripped out touches to his roles, that just sell the idea. It can be anything from a facial expression, a motion, or an ab - libbed line, but it can make or break the role. This movie is a classic. This is one movie that I really want to buy, but I haven't seen it available to purchase. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't realize that this was Johnny Depp's first starring role. He seemed like an old pro, and I was impressed.",Cry-Baby
135,madisonjt,Camp,9,8 January 2007,"If you don't like camp then stay away! John Waters is known for camp and although I personally am not a fan of his other movies he won me over with Cry Baby. I was eight years old the first time I saw Cry Baby. I made my mom rent it every weekend after that until she finally just bought it for me. Here I am fifteen years later and it is still my favorite movie. The actors and characters are great. There is a fine line between camp and bad acting and these actors pulled it off. The music is alive with 1950's rock and roll that will make you want to get up and dance, or at least tap your foot. Ultimately the movie is about being your self regardless of how you are viewed by society. We should all take pride in our inner beauty and stop hating people just because they are different from ourselves.",Cry-Baby
136,polaroo,Cry-Baby is awesome,10,31 July 2005,"Cry-Baby was one of the best movies ever. Johnny Depp did a terrific job and worked very well With Amy Locane. Great music,entertainment, and comedy was provided throughout the move. Cry-baby is one of my favorite movies of all time. Every time i see one of Johny Depp's movies it still amazes me on how he can be different. And he hardly ever looks the same. Pepper was one of my favorite characters. Tough, mean, and pregnant. Hatchet face on the other hand was kind of scary. Her teeth was partly what freaked me out the most. And her make-up kind of wrapped it all together. My favorite song that were on there were Teardrops are Falling and Jailman. At least i think that's what there called.",Cry-Baby
137,Cassi_Hayward,Troubled Love,10,28 September 2005,"The movie ""Cry Baby"" is about a young boy and girl from opposite sides of the track falling in love. Wade ""Cry baby"" Walker (Johnny Depp) is considered a drape and a juvenile delinquent, and Alison (Amy Locane) is considered a square and a perfect angel. In their time Drapes and Squares were not seen together. Cry Baby fights with all his heart going up against an ex-boyfriend, a concerned grandmother, and even jail to keep his love with Alison.Baldwin (Stephen Mailer), Alison's ex-boyfriend, does everything in his power to keep Alison to himself and away from Cry Baby. He picks fights and gets his gang together to vandalize the drapes property.Alison's grandma (Polly Bergen) is like the leader of the squares and in the beginning worries that Cry Baby will be the downfall of her grandchild. Since she is left with Alison's care, she is over protective; but she wants Alison happy more than anything. In the end she comes around and tells Alison to choose the man her heart loves.I believe director John Waters made a new twist to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and this provides a happy ending. Through his movie, Waters tells us that love happens when it happens and that no matter what background we come from, we should fight for love with all our hearts.I love this movie. The first time I saw this movie as a four year old girl, I said I was going to marry Cry Baby. I recommend this movie to everyone. It has action for men and romance for women. I think that it transports us back in time and helps us see the conferences of the two social classes and feeds our belief that love really can conquer it all. I have probably watched this movie a thousand times and will probably watch it a thousand more. It definitely is worth the eighty-five minutes it takes to watch.",Cry-Baby
138,broadwaywill,Review On Cry-Baby,10,15 July 2018,I thought that this movie was stupendous. The art the scenery the acting the singing the dancing everything was so good and impressed me a lot. Some examples that I liked about the movie were when Johnny Depp and his gang get out of their car and just get rough and tough with the squares. Another that I liked was the riot scene it had so much combat movements in it. And the final thing that I thought was impressive was the music overall it was so upbeat and head banging music.,Cry-Baby
139,kimsreply,Loved the film,9,22 January 2006,"I loved the comedy... funniest film I have seen in such a long time. Greatest send-up of so many things... comedy, love stories, middle America, Elvis, rock and roll, barbershop, musicals.. It was so tongue in cheek. Really good acting from the whole cast.. I am a Johnny Depp fan and this film shows off his sense of fun.. Choice of music scores ... superb. I felt at first it was going to be a poor second to John Travolta's Grease. It couldn't be further from the truth. John Walters has captured the period superbly and sent it up deliciously. The Cry Baby girls' line ""our besoms are our weapons"" was so funny.. And the french kiss scene with the storm brewing - hilarious.",Cry-Baby
140,s-east-1,Pretty good film if you're into rock and roll and rockabilly.,7,7 February 2006,"I've just watched this film for the first time ever - can't think where I've been! OK, I have to admit I've never heard of it before I saw it on DVD, and snapped it up because A: it was a film about the 50's, and B: it had Johnny Depp in it. How could I go wrong?! And I was right. It's pretty great.The music is fantastic, especially if you're into rock and roll and rockabilly anyway. What's extra-special is that most of the songs are original to the movie. There are some cool moves going down in this film - and even if Johnny doesn't feel comfortable with dancing (by his own admission); some of the other jumpers and jivers are wicked.There's an impressive list of 'beautiful people' in the cast (Johnny Depp obviously, who looks like a wonderful amalgamation of James Dean, Eddie Cochran, and sometimes even a young Elvis); but there's also Traci Lords (girls: her outfits are just to DIE for!); and co-star Amy Locane (who looks breath-taking as a Square but not so convincing a Drape as Traci Lords, I have to say).There's also just as impressive a list of acclaimed and highly talented actors and actresses - (all the above included) - but also the brilliant Iggy Pop; the effervescent Susan Tyrrell, who was just born to play Ramona Rickettes; a surprisingly brilliant Ricki Lake pops up as Johnny's sister Pepper; Kim McGuire does an awe-inspiring job of portraying Hatchet-Face aka Mona Malrovawski; Patricia Hearst is hilarious as Wanda Woodward's Mother; and lastly Polly Bergen, completely convincing as Allison's Grandmother.Something that HAS to be mentioned is the appearance of legendary Troy Donahue - made immortal in the song 'Sandra Dee', as sung by Rizzo in Grease... He plays Hatchet's father. However, his role is unfortunately all too minor: I would have liked to have seen more. One of the few scenes in which he does appear is surely the funniest in the movie, taking place in the courtroom after the riot between the Drapes and the Squares.Need I say more? All you Rockers/Greasers/would-be-Drapes and even those Squares out there - put it on your list for the next movie-night-in! Best line of the movie? Well one of them, for me anyway, has gotta be 'I wouldn't be seen DEAD in a full skirt - !' (Wanda Woodward/Traci Lords).",Cry-Baby
141,FluffsStuffs,Cry Baby My Surreal 50s fantasy,9,2 March 2006,I first saw cry baby when I was about 14.Up until this point I was fairly satisfied to watch john Hughes teen movies. Watching cry baby is watch so much better very kitsch cool clothes bizarre but strangely familiar people.All my friends wanted to be Alison and be with Johnny depp.he has never looked so pleasing! Guy from the wrong side of the tracks girl from the right side of the tracks fall in love cliché with so much more every color seems enhanced. The humor is silly and off the wall. The soundtrack has rally great 1950s songs .The Johnny Depp faux singing does get a bit grating at some points. the scene that springs to minds is when he is in a prison he breaks in the a song while in bed its very shrill. Probably the one audio bit of the film I could do without. but visually Johnny Depp is at his best.The costume are wondfully 50s.Great smaller parts for Traci lords and Iggy Pop. I cant really find a bad thing to say about it one of the best. http://www.cafepress.com/urbanpopart/1246577,Cry-Baby

If you are really into your films with music, i would also strongly recommend the rocky horror picture show! i love the songs on the film, i know them all! once you've watched it once you will want to watch it again and again, and possibly drive everyone around you insane because you keep singing the songs and repeating lines from the film!
