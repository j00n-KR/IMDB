0,SAMTHEBESTEST,Mimi is exactly a decade late to be called a Path-breaking film but surely provides a new start to Mainstream Bollywood Entertainers as a Worthy Adaptation.,6,27 July 2021,"Mimi (2021) :
Movie Review -Marathi Movie 'Mala Aai Vhaychay' (2011) was made exactly a decade ago when Indian Cinema had not experienced any such stories on a taboo subject like Surrogacy. Samruddhi Porey's conviction and non-filmy vision made that film a Path-breaking Classic. However, the range of Marathi Cinema was not that wide accross the Nation and therefore such a great film remained unknown and less watched. With Mimi, Laxman Utekar, himself a marathi man, has provided a larger platform to the same story with enough filmy style additional changes. Mimi may not be that realistic and hard-hitting because of additional changes made in the main character of the film and also because it was a decade late but for someone who has not seen Mala Aai Vhaychay, this one is nothing less than a terrific emotional entertainer.Mimi is a story of Mimi (Kriti Sanon), a beautiful girl and a dancer who dreams to become a bollywood actress. A foreign couple is introduced to her by a Driver (Pankaj Tripathi) who ask her to be a surrogate mother of their child for which she will be awarded Rs. 20 Lacs. Not aware of the importance of motherhood, Mimi agrees for the sake of money and gets pregnant but only to follow unexpected consequences of motherhood. Mimi sees a lot of changes from the original marathi flick as it creates more family friendly atmosphere around the main character. In the original one, we see the Mother literally fighting all alone and she looks realistic as her character is shown in completely rural, uneducated fashion. Here, Mimi looks modern, smart and more confident than her. Rest of the storyline remains same, literally copy paste and may be that's why there is a reason to call it a 'Late Attempt'. The same story 7-8 years ago would have been a sensation.Kriti Sanon who hasn't got out of glamourous roles till date has finally managed to came out of it. Without any doubt, Mimi is her best performance till date. Pankaj Tripathi runs absolute riot. He will make you laugh like never before. His screen space was quite lower in the films he has done before but Mimi finally gives him enough space to showcase his hilarious dialogue delivery throughout the film. Sai Tamhankar is the 3rd best performer in the film whereas rest of the supporting cast is fine with their roles. Music is highly engaging and supportive to the narrative as not a single song looks out of the context or boring. Every song has particular situation and importance of its own. Mimi is 10 minutes longer than expected but otherwise the screenplay is very gripping. Technical aspects are nice with just one or two dull moments with the child but that's okay, it's just a child afterall.Laxman Utekar seemed more matured from his previous film 'Luka Chuppi'. That film wasn't anything fantastic and lacked quality writing too, so it wasn't his fault actually. With Mimi he got a strong script in hands and he has written it too so he knew exactly where the execution can take it. Most importantly he kept that pan-India humour alive. Mala Aai Vhayvhay was a pretty serious film on sensitive issue whereas Mimi is far more funny and hilarious. It hurts the basics of the sensitive story but not that much. Utekar has already made a terrific emotional drama like 'Tapaal' in Marathi so all he needed was a great piece of writing. Luka Chuppi lacked it but not Mimi. He uses all his skills to make this story family friendly and also adds enough commercial values. Overall, a worthy adaptation to a Path-breaking Classic and yet another new ray of hope for mainstream bollywood entertainers who lack socially important subjects.RATING - 6.5/10*",Mimi
1,ketgup83,Kriti Sanon Gives Career's Best Performance In This Beautiful Tale Of Motherhood,7,28 July 2021,"Surrogacy is a process where infertile couple and woman (the surrogate) will carry a baby through pregnancy on behalf of a couple and then return the baby to the intended parent(s) once it is born. While only few Bollywood films like Filhaal (2002) and Chori Chori Chupke Chupke (2001) have explored the complex theme, Mimi takes a step ahead with right message and in right direction.Set in the town of Rajasthan, Mimi tells the story of a dancer (Kriti Sanon) who wants to rule the Bollywood one day. Her aspiration takes a different direction when a local cabbie, Bhanu Pratap Panday (Pankaj Tripathi) contacts her to become the surrogate mother to an American couple (Evelyn Edwards and Aidan Whytock) who are desperate to have a baby. Lured by huge sum of money, Mimi readily accepts the offer only to find that her to-be-born child is suffering from down syndrome.Directed by Laxman Utekar (Luka Chuppi), Mimi is based on acclaimed Marathi film 'Mala Aai Vhhaychy!' by Samruoddhi Porey. Mimi opens on a pleasant note with Pankaj Tripathi's typical comic act where he gives his best to convince Mimi to be the surrogate mother for the American couple. Introduction song of Kriti Sanon followed by her interaction with Pankaj Tripathi is sparkling. The movie becomes more interesting when Mimi agrees to carry the baby for the couple followed by a surprise event which shatters her life. The second half is filled with emotional drama followed by a happy ending. The best part of watching Mimi is that it keeps the serious topics of surrogacy entertaining with subtle humor without loosing its sheen. The movie is 133 minutes long but does not give away any chance of losing the focus as the writing helps to keep the right balance between the drama and comedy.While editing takes a back seat, songs composed by maestro A R Rahman are just passable except for Rihaayi De which is beautifully composed. Cinematography is pretty good with natural ambience of Rajasthan which renders vibrant flavor that goes well with Rajasthani tradition. Mimi belongs to Kriti Sanon who has probably given her career's best performance. The gorgeous actress fits it right to the central character and plays it like a boss, expressing with right emotions. Pankaj Triptahi is electrifying as usual. The brilliant actor just gets better with his one-liners and comic acts which brings down the house. I also liked Evelyn Edwards as Summer who plays the role of a desperate mother while Manoj Pahwa, Supriya Pathak and Sai Tamhankar are fine in their respective role.Overall, Mimi has wonderful and offbeat storyline layered with superb performances. Mimi is currently streaming on Netflix and is produced by Maddock Films and Jio Studios.",Mimi
2,MuviFan73,Just one tip... wait for it!,9,29 July 2021,"Story: A foreign couple tries to have a baby through surrogacy in India. The fun ride goes in selecting women for surrogacy. Conceiving happens, the fun ride to see choose baby grow in womb occurs. Sorrowfully some tests determine the baby has downs syndrome. The foreign couple leave, leaving no option but abortion. The surrogate's character however keeps the baby. It comes into the world without defects. Now what will happen?Cinematography: Justified. The mohalla & its houses, the palace, the clinic, the transport, the hospital everything is chosen well.Direction: A great job in direction as well. The director has timed and filmed the consequences really well. Along the journey you will enjoy, laugh hard, & in the end it's sure to make you weep.Acting (& music): Acting comes from cast and the casting here is done really well. Whatever your budget you can get some decent actors. Music in second half is above average and goes well along with the movie.Final Verdict: Well I have quite a few things in mind.If it's a surrogate, will Dr. Give an example of Shilpa Shetty?Isn't the surrogate made aware of terms where she should abort?How can one just give up to absorbing pain after so long?This is our country that's one issue & how the contract acted legally that's second.Finally arrives the message at the end of the movie which is something. Please make a note of it!",Mimi
3,nadkarnisumeet,A rare gem on OTT!!,7,2 August 2021,"Mimi review :Ladies and gentleman, we finally have something to cheer about!! After the onslaught of underwhelming OTT releases starting with Sadak 2 (2020) right till Toofaan last month, Mimi comes as a welcome break - a film you can sit and enjoy with your entire family. This is a film which would've worked in theatres as well through strong word of mouth though the makers decided to take the OTT route.Adapted from the Marathi film Mala Aai Vhaychay (2011), Mimi revolves around the titular character (Kriti Sanon) who is a Rajasthani dancer with a Bollywood dream. A local driver (Pankaj Tripathi) approaches her to be a surrogate to a foreign couple (Evelyn- Aidan) for a fat amount.Next, Mimi conceives and is in her last stage of pregnancy when the couple run away due to a misunderstanding. The strong willed Mimi keeps the child, raises him as her own son till one day, the couple resurface to claim him.Writer - director Laxman Utekar deserves applause for mixing humour and emotions effectively as well as extracting superlative performances from his entire cast. Kriti Sanon delivers her best performance till date. Pankaj Tripathi is first rate. Sai Tamhankar excels in a non glamorous role. Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak lend solid support. Evelyn Edwards leaves a mighty impression as the firang lady who cannot conceive. Rohan Shankar's zingy dialogues deserve a special mention.The film has a positive feel to it right from Mimi's ""never give up"" attitude to the Hindu Muslim unity shown between her and Sai Tamhankar's character. In present scenario, such a feel good movie is always welcome. Recommended watch on Netflix/ Jio Cinema!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Mimi
4,Sir_AmirSyarif,"A moving take on surrogacy, parenthood, and mankind",7,8 August 2021,"Laxman Utekar's 'Mimi' is a light-hearted yet inspiring look at surrogacy, parenthood, and mankind. Instead of giving a solid ending, unfortunately, the final act stumbles a bit over sentiment and traditional third-act issues. Kriti Sanon is strong and able to carry the film through its tough moments, while Pankaj Tripathi delivers an outstanding performance.",Mimi
5,katyayan-12892,Delightful,9,24 October 2021,"Review By Kamal KJohn and Summer are a couple from the US who are looking for the right Indian woman for surrogacy. Bhanu (Pankaj Tripathi), a taxi driver tries to help the couple in the process.Mimi (Kriti Sanon) is a vivacious young wannabe actress. She dances locally to show her talent. In one such event, the foreign couple takes a liking to her. Bhanu Pratap convinces her to bear a child as it would help her fulfil the Bollywood dream. What happens when the couple leaves Mimi midway? How Mimi deals with the repercussions of surrogacy pregnancy is the basic plot of the movie.Kriti Sanon is perfect for the part of Mimi. It sits perfectly with the image she is building through her choices.The beginning is business as usual for Kriti Sanon playing small-town girl, but things change around the pre-interval mark. The character takes a dramatic turn, and she does well in those portions. The role offers her to explore something different, and she makes the best use of it. Within her short career, Mimi is a game-changer for considering the scope it offers and the way she carries it.The entire first hour of the movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay is smooth and blends the entertainment neatly into it. The casting of Pankaj Tripathi is a masterstroke here. He is in terrific form and carries the movie on his shoulder like a lead.Overall on Such a Topic , This Film Is Well Crafted And Efforts do Testament In The Final Results.",Mimi
6,djurrepower,not really for an western audience,4,17 August 2021,"Its very camp in its drama. With really awful audio editing, and not so great acting. The story is over the top drama, with many eyerolling moments. Many jokes are really not relatable for a western audience, and most setups just dont really make sense. All in all, the high imdb rating is mostly from eastern viewers since I don't see the average joe enjoying this movie, unless you're into the camp bollybood style. But even then, if you're into that stuff there are far better absurd bollywood movies out there.4/10: nah.",Mimi
7,SoumikBanerjee25,"Not groundbreaking per se, But It's a Heartwarming presentation nonetheless!",7,30 July 2021,"I knew people would be divisive over its portraiture of such delicate topics of social importance. However, just to be clear; I would like to refrain from all these arguments. The reason being, I don't consider myself enough qualified to enunciate anyone's moral compass in regards to what kind of message this film wants to put forward. I can give you my subjective viewpoints, but then again; does it even matter, or should it actually matter anyway?Moving on...This is an insouciant and laid-back presentation targeted at (should not that be hard to guess) everyone; in a literal sense. The makers intended to get the keynotes of this entire execution delivered to as many people as they possibly could. That's naive, coming from them. But, as far as I'm concerned; this could have been so much better if only their pursuance was a little bit more consequential and grounded.Now, don't get me wrong; I was still able to enjoy it for what it's worth.I laughed, I sobbed, got sentimental, and at certain points was enraged too; this was such an emotional roller coaster ride. And for that, the majority of the credits must go to its Writing and particularly to the Dialogues. Yet, I can't help but criticize the frequent tonal shifts. This happened all too often for my taste and I honestly found it to be irksome. In addition to its conflicting innuendos, I do also bear a grudge against its pacing or the lethargic Screenplay, to be precise. Which again I felt sluggish and unduly prolonged.However, the impressive Performances and the enchanting Score (by A. R. Rahman) were the definitive highlights for me. This is undoubtedly Kriti Sanon's career-best personation. Through total commitment and sheer dedication (Kriti gained 15 kg for her role here), She was able to gracefully convey all forms of subtleties in her character arc. On the other hand, Pankaj Tripathi is a natural. He single-handedly carried pretty much all the comedic elements and heightened up their effectuality as well. What a guy!On a finishing note, whilst inextricably linked to the subjects of Adoption, Abortion, Surrogacy; ""Mimi"" exemplifies a soul-stirring narrative that tugs right at your heartstrings. Helped by an optimistic outlook on numerous aspects that are relevant to our society today. Whether it be Religious Harmony, the Value of Kith & Kin, or the most sacred bond one could ever contemplate i.e. Between a mother and her child.""A mother is she who can take the place of all others but whose place no one else can take.""",Mimi

9,ridi-arahan,"Life is a process , not a verdict that transcends the flow of a living system",9,29 July 2021,"What worked:
So what makes Mimi a great watch is an almost balanced perspective regarding the dilemma that appears at the last act of the movie. Of course it's an tearjerker at times with the execution but keeping the hopes alive, decoding them, and giving just reasonings for the perspective makes it an alive, scholar and beautiful watch. Rehman keeps the movie much alive with the score and music, an equally great work by the director. It would have felt flat had the performances were less powerful and dull. Kriti gave the best performances so far. Manoj, Pankaj and Supriya excelled very well in their parts making the overall movie a fine watch. I was pleasantly surprised by the screenplay of the movie especially its scope, layers and overall a balanced character portrayal
What did not work:
There were some rooms for improvements of course but all the melodramas and tearjerkers were equally valid. After-all it's a local movie in the local context. The movie could still have been valid even without some scenes with sentimental values to cut down the runtime.Final verdict: highly recommended.",Mimi
10,TheNonSmoker,Very stereotypical,1,17 August 2021,"These types of movies are trying to create a one-sided stereotypical narrative by showing Hindu society intolerant, conservative, etc, I think Bollywood should the upcoming woke Hindu generation and take neutral ground.",Mimi
11,user-651-726996,An out & out Kriti Sanon Film,7,16 August 2021,"Major part of the film's story is understandable from the trailer itself. So no surprises there. With a very good cast and some really good acting by everyone and at just above 2 hours, the film is more of a tearful story than a fun ride.The lead character Mimi, played by Kriti, doesn't have a strong pre-pregnancy story accept for one goal which makes me not so empathetic towards her character. Yes, I do understand her problems later on but the past isn't strong enough.. But everything that happens later, from a story POV, is wonderful except for a hurried climax.I am hooked with the first few lines of the song 'Parama Sundari' yet the song doesn't feel like anything new to my ears. The music is average & is definitely not one of A. R. Rahman's finest. Another thing to note is the song 'Hututu' being so similar to 'Tu bin bataye' from Rang De basanti. It is so similar in it's music that I just can't digest 'Hututu' as a different song and that is really sad. Even some of the BGM is straight from 'Tu bin bataye'. I didn't expect this from A. R. Rahman. There are other music directors who repeat/ remix their (or others') songs but Rahman? I personally haven't found A. R. Rahman creating a masterpiece that even equals his Roja. Roja was his raw talent, his aura his peak. Nothing has come close to it.As for the film in it's entirety, with some good humor here and there, this film is a family film and is definitely worthy of your time.",Mimi
12,cseabhi,Decent but gets boring somewhere,5,29 July 2021,"Laxman Utekar is back with another social issue topic - surrogacy. The movie starts off as a light hearted comedy but ends up being an emotional one.Mimi deals with the subject of surrogacy and how the society sees it and all the pros and cons related to this subject. Definately touching this subject is a brave act. But when you are making a film revolving around this topic, there is certain responsibility and that seems missing here.The story looks fresh and important one but its the exeuction that has let the film down. The charcter of Mimi is very underwritten and the way the subject of surrogacy has been dealt with and explained in the film seems hurried.Character of Mimi was very undercooked. Imagine a woman who agrees to become a surrogate mother in lieu of a heavy ammount of money, this is not an easy decision to make and it's not very easy and a cakewalk as shown in the movie. It's all very hurried one, as if director was in hurry to complete the first half of the story.Even the emotional scenes in the later stage of the movie seems hurried one and not pretty convincing.Kirti Sanon as Mimi though does a brilliant job, Pankaj Tripathi as Bhanu is brilliant as usual.Laxman Utekar this time fails to make a convincing story and even the editing was not good as the movie was bit lengthy.Mimi is not a bad film, its decent one actually but gets boring in between and not that convincing.Music by AR Rahman is decent, not like his best work but definately better than other recent songs and music.",Mimi
13,SumanShakya,Witty and compelling drama with few contrivances....,6,16 October 2021,"""Mimi"" deals with the surrogacy a foreign couple opts for from a working class rural girl in India and later abandons the surrogacy when it's learnt the baby to be born suffers from Down's Syndrome. Subject wise it explores a relevant issue, surrogacy and the underlying complexities. A little known drama ""Life Express"" (2009) too dealt this subject.""Mimi"" is refreshing, entertaining, witty and at times makes a compelling watch on an emotional level. Kriti Sanon and Pankaj Tripathi (seen together in ""Luka Chuppi"") give tremendous performances. The drama has twists and last minute alterations, for which the audiences get gripped throughout. However, the film isn't free of flaws. At times the humor feels a bit forced, there are some obvious contrivances, music is average, and the film goes for an overlength. The emotions in the climax fall a bit inadequate and go for a relaxed end. Overall, it makes a decent watch and will probably give it a repeated viewing.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4.",Mimi
14,vjnambu,Feel good and heart touching,10,11 September 2021,"When i saw first mimi's trailer, i felt it will be an entertaining movie. An American couple, summer and john arrive in India for a surrogate mother and their driver bhanu finds mimi, a local dancer who dreams of becoming a Bollywood heroine. When bhanu first approaches her, she shuns him away but when he tells her that she will get money for her to go to Bollywood, she agrees. Mimi gets pregnant and that time hides in her friend shama's home. When the doctor tells john and summer that the child inside mimi has down syndrome, they leave disappointingly. A devastated mimi returns to her home pregnant and when her parents ask about the child, she lies them that bhanu is the father. Mimi delivers a boy who is very healthy and Fair. His white tone skin becomes the talk of the town. Bhanu's wife and mother find him and mimi reveals the truth. The boy is named raj and his happily living with mimi and her family. But 4 years later, john and summer return to take raj back. Will mimi give raj back to them is the rest of the film.Kriti sanon gives her career best performance as Mimi. Her body transformation is commendable. Pankaj tripathi is likable as bhanu. Rest of the cast also performed well. The child raj was very sweet. Comedy and emotions are balanced very well. Second half turns emotional and ends with a feel good note.On the whole, Mimi is a very well made film which is feel good and heartwarming.",Mimi

Every actor even some with his one or two look will win your heart. Pankaj Tripathi has already mastered in these types of characters and he did it again. Now, Kriti Sanon has given her career best (till now) performance here. She will definitely make you cry in some scenes.BGM and songs by Rahman have played a very important role here. We have already loved 'Param Sundari' & 'Rihaayi De'. In the film the Visuals of 'Choti Si Chiraiya' will make you emotional.Throughout the film it has given a beautiful message and in the climax we get another strong message which I think the movie actually wanted to say. And with this I can say Mimi is A Must Watch.Available on JioCinema & Netflix.© MandalBros.",Mimi

21,nidhunmoviebuff,Dramedy at its best!,7,27 July 2021,"An emotional, compelling drama from Bollywood after long, Mimi is a superb film about surrogacy and its aftereffects.A remake of the National Award winning Marathi film Mala Aai Vhhaychy! (2011), Mimi stars Kriti Sanon as a village performer who is forced to act as a surrogate for a foreign couple to raise funds for her dreams of making it to Bollywood.The complications that arise amongst the conservative society around her and its aftereffects forms the rest of this story, that leaves you with a lump in your throat by the end.Kriti Sanon delivers her career-best role as the titular Mimi playing the full range from naive village lass to caring mother with elan. She is ably supported by a fantastic supporting cast that includes Manoj Pahwa, Supriya Pathak and Sai Tamhankar.But it is the ever-dependable Pankaj Tripathi who steals every scene that he is in, delivering comedy and emotional sequences with equal aplomb. What a national treasure he is!An emotionally draining experience. Recommended!",Mimi
22,rahul000994,A Movie Taking On Motherhood With Emotions !!!,9,27 July 2021,"Based on acclaimed Marathi film 'Mala Aai Vhhaychy!' by Samruoddhi Porey, Mimi is skilfully adapted by Laxman Utekar. He along with screenwriter Rohan Shankar ensure the Hindi film has its own character and identity while retaining the essence of the original. The infusion of situational comedy may oversimplify surrogacy in the opening portions to extend its reach to the masses.The 25-year-old girl hopes to fulfil her ambition of becoming an actress in Mumbai, by using the enormous money (Rs. 20 Lakhs), promised to her for bearing the child. Things progress as per the ambitious plan of our rebellious protagonist, albeit to a certain point. Life isn't all sunshine and rainbows, after all. A potential health hazard to the unborn child leaves everyone shaken up. Dreams are shattered, until they are not.Mimi offers a light-hearted, yet moving take on surrogacy and its repercussions. It even cleverly steers people to adoption. There's a catch here though. The film is well-intentioned but the adoption segment gets an idyllic approach and not realistic to ensure closure and that can be misleading. There is already a lot of misinformation on the adoption process in our country, and a certain part of the story adds to the cesspool of inaccurate facts. That, being passed off as cinematic liberty is hard to digest.Kriti Sanon marks her arrival as a solid actor who can carry a film on her own. Her eyes speak anger and anguish with a certain calm - a mark of a mature performer. Another actor who co-shoulders the film along with Kriti is the brilliant Pankaj Tripathi. He is as much the hero of the film as Kriti. From referring to potential surrogates as 'MAAL' to relentlessly fighting for Mimi's well-being, Pankaj Tripathi renders yet another outstanding performance. His comic timing and expression of the visible rift between privilege and poverty is compelling. Manoj Pahwa, Supriya Pathak and Sai Tamhankar are effective in their significant roles. Actors playing the American couple- Evelyn Edwards and Aidan Whytock are decent as well. Their characters aren't one dimensional, which is refreshing.A complete family entertainer after long - Mimi picks a relevant topic and turns it into an engaging, empowering and compassionate tale on humanity and motherhood.",Mimi

Can't reveal much (don't watch the trailer), but fam, amazing acting, really good screenplay and dialogues, very well shot! AR Rahman's music will move you like it hasn't in the recent past.While there is nothing mind-blowing about the movie, it is one of the examples for why you don't tons of money, a star-studded cast of 10, fancy locations, over-the-top action to make a really good movie as long as you have a good story first, backed up by some solid actors next.I know I am nitpicking, but the only negative IMO was the inconsistent accent, but you won't care for it enough to bother you.

28,madanmarwah,A story on surrogacy done well,7,28 July 2021,"This is one movie which keeps you interested throughout its run and hence can be called a well made film. The subject of surrogacy is tackled in a authentic way with bits of humour on the way. Kriti Sanon is Mimi and acts remarkablely well as the young Bollywood obsessed girl who is thrown into motherhood and has to give up her dreams of becoming a film star when she is presented as a surrogate mother by Pankaj Tripathi in exchange for money to a tourist American couple ( Evelyn Edwards and Aidan Whytok ). The arrangement doesn't work out as planned due to some developments leaving Mimi pregnant and in dire straits.Kriti Sanon has acted superbly in this complex role. She has some emotional scenes in which she scores. Hers is probably her best performance till date. Pankaj Tripathi is excellent as usual in the role of helpful taxi driver who initially is a middleman but later becomes emotionally attached with Mimi and her family. His one liners are delightful and enliven many a scene. Mention must be made of Evelyn Edwards who impresses as the American lady desperately seeking a child.Director Laxman Utekar has made an endearing movie from a good screenplay which connects with the audience. The characters are real and how they go about managing their problems makes for interesting viewing. The film has a fluid linear narrative and the dialogue keeps it going. Manor Pahwa and Supriya Pathak are likeable in supporting roles as Mimi's parents, despite their melodramatic acting.",Mimi

31,WorldMovie99,An optimistic movie of Feminism.,7,21 August 2021,"It's a women movie. Good story, good script, good performance. The male characters are weak though. The background score is unnecessarily used sometimes, but good in some. The camera cut are short and depth is ignored. The comedy parts are not funny, means comedy surrounding polygamy issues and surrogates doesn't seem funny. It's better to represent it with seriousness. The serious parts are impressive with its sentiments and emotions. Summing up, it's an optimistic comedy drama of feminism.The movie revolves around Mimi, who acts as a surrogate mother for a foreign couple. She undergoes a series of several social and emotional traumas prior the climax. It's ultimately like a mother influencing another women towards motherhood. The statement reminds- "" In order to be a parent, you don't need to have your child."" It's an example of Mimi's vibe motivating the foreign women.",Mimi
32,mynameritesh,Beautiful Movie,9,29 July 2021,"Mimi is heartwarming tale of surrogacy which is filled with quirky humor, soul stirring emotions and impeccable performances by a brilliant cast. With a simple plot this film is filled with a lot of heart and drives through with bona fide emotions. Without no arguments, this is probably the best performance of Kriti yet. Pankaj Tripathi with his brilliant antiques make this film easily one of the finest bollywood films this year which melts your heart with a beautiful climax.Thoughts
The film is based on a very important underlying theme of Surrogacy. Director Laxman Utekar whom we have seen direct Luka Chuppi in another social commentary of generalising Live In eelationships has again delivered another them with more emotions and heart. Beautiful direction and outstanding casting drives this film. Kriti , Sai and Pankaj Tripathi are just terrific. Though the second half slows down a bit but the poignant climax makes it truly moving and easily puts this film ahead of other bollywood movies this year . Outstanding music by AR Rahman elevates the emotional moments to new highs throughout. A powerful film with a great message.",Mimi

36,anikb-87099,Kriti proves she can act!,9,27 July 2021,"This film finally proves that Kriti can act and that she is not made only for those commercial over the top films that she has done in the past.Over the past few weeks we had dissappointing films from Bollywood and finally with MIMI, that streak comes to an end. The comedy and emotions (the emotions especially) work out really well in this film thanks to great writing and great performances by Kriti, Pankaj, Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak. In fact, this could well be the best remake made so far in recent times in Bollywood.The climax is the USP of this film. For a very long time I haven't experienced such an emotional climax that used to be a trend in the early 2010's. Imagine if that child had really parted, OMG tears would be flowing through everyone's eye but sadly they didnt choose that path (not revealing anything else) which kind of made me a little disappointed so I reduced 1 star.The music is only suitable in the film and it works really well. None except that item number would make it to your playlist but they work so well in the film.Overall, this is the first Bollywood film in recent times that I would recommend to everyone be it young or old families or singles. Had it released in theatres, it would have had a slow start but eventually it would have made some 70-80 Cr. Business which for a low budget film like this would have been extraordinary.",Mimi
37,soumyalal2,Brave Attempt,7,28 July 2021,"I have never seen a movie on surrogacy correct me if i am wrong but i guess this is 1st Bollywood movie on surrogacy. Kriti Sanon has fabulous acting so perfect dialogue delivery she has improved a lot. Pankaj tripathi sir is backbone of the movie. Though at parts it get boring but overall a nice movie. Sai Tamhankar,Supriya Patahk, Manoj Pahwa are also done great work specially comedy timing of Manoj Pahwa are awesome. Nice weekend watch.",Mimi
38,grarunkumar1994,Beautiful.!!,9,26 July 2021,"'Mimi' is a well written, well made film which carries a heart.Story revolves around the surrogate mother whose biological parents abandon the surrogacy and the struggle she goes through.Kriti Sanon may have a ton of films under her wings that shows off her glamour but this definitely proves she's more than just the pretty face. Perhaps the first time she's going to be loved as an actress, instead of a model.Pankaj Tripathi , as usual is at his best as a character that drives the story initially and later adds humour and fun when the plot gets tense.Evelyn and Aiden, instead of being a usual 'english couple in Indian film' did invest emotionally as the chatacters who wants a kid. Evelyn did an amazing job especially in the latter half of the film.Manoj ,Supriya and Sai were impressive even as side characters.A. R. Rahman's music score was good but the background score was flawless, both of which flows beautifully throughout the film, adding an extra cherry on top.Overall it is a beautiful film that deserves a watch.",Mimi
39,nitsvirusboyz,Recommended 👍🏼 by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,7,24 August 2021,"Mimi is a well executed and wonderfully made film with a perfect blend of humour and emotions. Laxman Utekar and Roshan Shankar's story is inspired from a Marathi film Mala Aai Vhhaychy! (2011) written by Samruddhi Porey. Mimi is skillfully adapted by Laxman Utekar and direction is impressive. The execution and his direction becomes more matured in comparison to his last outing Luka Chuppi (2019).The heartwarming story, gripping screenplay and the effective dialogues makes this movie a perfect watch. The writers did the good job in keeping the audience thoroughly entertained. The last 15-20 minutes is quite emotional which will leave the viewers with teary eyes.Kriti Sanon delivered her finest performances to date. She played her titular role with a perfection. And her scenes with child actor are delight to watch. Pankaj Tripathi never disappoints with his screen presence and his hilarious dialogue delivery. Once again he delivered an entertaining performance. Despite limited screen space, Sai Tamhankar, Manoj Pahwa, and Supriya Pathak are effective in their supporting roles. The American couple Evelyn Edwards and Aidan Whytock also gave a decent performance.A. R. Rahman's music is average and background score was good which goes well with the film. Param Sundari is a chartbuster. Rahman's Rihaayi De and Kailash Kher's Choti Si Chiraiya is touching while others songs are just passable. The editing could have been done better in the second half, the movie can be easily trimmed by 10-15 minutes.Mimi Movie Rating:

42,itsallaboutflicks,"You don't always need to be a MAMA to nurture and love your kid, sometimes you could just be a MIMI.",7,11 August 2021,"Charming Kriti Sanon's Mimi delivers a glaring message on surrogacy with a few amusing touches on the inherent Indian bias towards a baby boy and a fair skin tone, driven by a measured, sparkling Pankaj Tripathi in top form, amply supported by A R Rahman's mojo and some delightful performances. The message though gets slightly tedious towards the end, perhaps due to its length or execution.Funny, emotional ride with Pankaj Tripathi at the wheels! (spoilers alert)The flick is all about the wonderful message that it puts forward. It has been able to tackle the issue of surrogacy pretty well and the simple, light presentation could easily be comprehended by viewers from all walks of life. I liked how they brought up the inherent Indian bias towards caste, baby boy and a fair skin-tone with snide references here and there, depicting how silly these notions really are. It also makes a glaring cause for a large number of unfortunate orphans out there, and raises the question why couples do not resort to adopting an orphan and instead go frantically searching for a suitable surrogate mother.The flick is literally driven by Pankaj Tripathi with flawlessly timed humour and impeccably measured emotions. Kriti Sanon is at her charming best and the others too have filled their shoes really well, especially Supriya Pathak. A R Rahman's songs bring in a special mood, that enhances the flick's emotions.The flick though, loses it charm towards the end, probably because of its length or the execution. The boy's dubbing did not help either. Nevertheless, it should be watched for it's simplicity, impactful message and an incredible Pankaj Tripathi!",Mimi
43,benighted2005,Tear Fest.,9,2 August 2021,"Oh my word, this film had me bawling. I'm a father so as someone who understands that bit, it really hit home. Kriti is actually a good actress. But the film has a gravitating storyline and a great execution. I can't believe the ups, downs, lows, highs and you know? After several years it seems A R Rahman has risen from his own ashes and delivered a good soundtrack. His voice on one song is unbelievable. Loved this film.",Mimi

46,tarekali-19909,truly emotional and unforgettable film,9,23 September 2021,"Mimi is a truly emotional and unforgettable film that delves into a hitherto unexplored dark corner of society - the massive surrogacy industry. The movie delivers critical messages on the great emotional cost of surrogacy, both for the host mother and the hopeful couple. There are no villains in this movie, only people desperately seeking happiness. The true beauty of this film is the sacrifices that people are willing to make for the happiness of children, and the immense pain that comes from not having or losing children.Pankaj carries the movie with great depth and maturity, an everyman with a heart of gold. I would watch anything from him and Nawazuddin, light years ahead of the garbage that bodybuilding Khans churn out nowadays.But the real gem of this outing is Kriti Sanon. She captured and commanded every scene, and showed an incredible depth of emotion and range, demonstrating a true hero's journey and evolution, transitioning from shallow materialism to noble sacrifice. I truly think she deserves an award for her performance, and of all the new female actors of Bollywood, Kriti stands miles apart and above the rest.I was very happily surprised to learn that the sweet and sweeping soundtrack came from guru A. R. Rahman. Very apt for the maestro to lend his gifts to deserving films like this.The ending of the movie is a 3 point landing, a ball out of the park, a perfect dive. I did not see that twist which brought all the threads together, and which ended by delivering to us yet another devastating reality check on the suffering of children worldwide. Bravo to everyone who made this film.",Mimi
47,puranjanbasak,Mimi!!,10,27 July 2021,"Mimi is inspired from the 2010 marathi film 'mala aai vhhaychy' which in itself is a national award winner. Here are the positives and negatives.Acting:kriti sanon has given her best performance till date. I was at loss of words talking about her performance. Her dialogue delivery,expressions everything is top notch. She is a potential star. The supporting cast has done a tremendous job. Sai tamhankar, manoj pahwa, supriya pathak hv ably supported the film.The 'pankaj tripathi' factor:i think appreciating him is an under appreciation itself. This man is a legend in true sense. His dialogue delivery, comic timing, expressions, body language, everything is so inch perfect. He is a masterclass of acting.Climax: the climax is so so good. It left me with a smile and happy tears. After a long time the climax of a movie has impressed me. The film will make u weep at several places. U just cannot take ur eyes off the screen.Music: the music by AR Rahman is brilliant. Every song is so soulful and melodious. Be it param sundari or hututu or any song. But the song 'rihaai 'and its placement will make u weep. Its so beautiful.Bgm:okay so this my only little criticism. The bgm in the emotional scenes is brilliant. But in the comedy scenes it was used excessively at several places. The director should hv trusted the situation and writing(which is brilliant) a bit more.The message:so who is a mother?the one who gives birth or the one who looks after the child or both? A question which would require centuries to answer. And an urge for adoption as well.I cannot talk less about this film and the impact it has had on me. So go and watch the film. Its so heartwarming and emotional. I rate it 10 out of 10.",Mimi
48,Perspicuity1,A simple lighthearted comedy film that is bound to make you emotional.,7,12 September 2021,"I was looking forward to watch Mimi mainly for its humour, but the first half didn't turn out to be the way I had hoped. One of the reasons for a not so impressive first half would be the trailer, which revealed way too much, and secondly the screenplay and direction were quite shaky. The film picks up however in the second half, after Mimi (Kriti Sanon) is left alone to take care of the baby. Although I went in to enjoy some comedy in this film, but it was its emotional moments that affected me the most.Kriti Sanon hasn't really done any film as such that could really put her acting skills to test, her best performance so far has been Bareilly Ki Barfi (2017), but I don't think anyone remembers her role because everything got overshadowed in that film by the outstanding performance of Rajkummar Rao. 'Mimi' gives her the opportunity and the space to perform and she has delivered like never before. Be it the scene where she develops motherly affection for the child, or the scene involving her emotional outburst against Summer and John, Kriti shines in each one of them.The supporting cast of the film is equally strong with Manoj Pahwa playing Mimi's father and Supriya Pathak playing Mimi's mother. Popular Marathi actress Sai Tamhankar playing Mimi's friend, Shama, lends solid support to Kriti. Hopefully this will open the doors for her to do more Hindi films. A child actor named Sheikh Ishaque Mohammad, playing the role of Aatif, deserves special mention because he was just hilarious. Foreign actors in Indian films are normally just foreigners who end up acting in movies just because of their availability. Producers don't go out of their way to find white actors, simple because why would you pay in dollars or euros for actors that the audience won't even care about. But for a change, this film does have American actors who don't live in India, and are actually quite good. Kudos to Evelyn Edwards, playing the role of Summer, who actually learnt Hindi for the film and managed to speak very fluently. Evelyn has given a beautiful performance in the film.Pankaj Tripathi plays the role of Bhanu, the man who brings forth the proposal of surrogacy to Mimi. There are certain actors in the world who perhaps don't know how to do bad acting, the respect they have for their craft just doesn't allow them to put even one foot wrong. Pankaj Tripathi, is one such actor. A dedicated actor who conveys every emotion with complete conviction. As a viewer, you end up believing every single thing that he says. Pankaj Tripathi's performance in Mimi is outstanding to say the least.I was quite surprised to know that A. R. Rahman is associated with this project. Although, Rahman is known to do all kinds of projects in Tamil and Telugu, one rarely sees him do Hindi films, unless they are big projects or are movies being made by his friends. I think Jio Studios, the producers of this film, might have brought him on board considering they were also the distributor of A. R. Rahman's dream project 99 Songs (2019), a movie that was stuck without release for a very long time. The songs of Mimi stand out for being unique and unusual, you may not like them the first time you hear them. Three songs will definitely stay with you, ""Rock a Bye Baby"", ""Chhoti Si Chiraiyya"" and of course ""Rihaayi De"", which is hands down the best song composed by A. R. Rahman in a long time.By no means is Mimi a perfect film, it has its fair share of flaws, the trailer had more humour than the actual film, but it does have a new story, one that is bound to make you emotional. Mimi is prominently a lighthearted comedy film with a few dramatic moments' at certain points. Don't go in with anymore expectations because that's all what's there to it.",Mimi
49,sanjeevanwar,Good movie with slightly outdated subject,6,30 July 2021,"Anwar Says: An adaptation of National Award Winning Marathi Movie of 2011 MALA AAI VHHAYCHY, a decade late to talk about the subject of surrogacy in society but well said by the director Laxman Utekar. Overall I would rate it high on performance and content which has been able to build contact with viewers.It took about half an hour to build the pace but after that it took off, due to the solid screen impact of Kirti Sanon and an actor who never fails - Pankaj Tripathi . Kirti, after this movie, joins the category of Tapsee Pannu and Aalia Bhatt . Her acting has an edge over her role of Bitti Mishra in Bareilly ki Burfi . Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak as parents are as simple and flow with the characters.The American Couple looking for surrogate mother also have an impact, to the extent that sometimes you empathise with them and curse them in another frame. One more character Sai Tamhankar, Mimi's childhood friend, played her role admirably well. Comic timing of the disciple of Manoj Pahwa is also noticed and we would see more of him. Music and songs by AR Rahman flow with the script.Not an extra ordinary movie but watch it for Kirti Sanon , she has put on 15 kgs.

59,surajpnair,'Mimi' - A dramatic rollercoaster,7,27 July 2021,"Never judge a film by its trailer, and that's what Mimi states vociferously. The trailer almost revealed what to expect from this film, showing all the key plot beats, and I was kind of disappointed, though I was glad to notice AR Rahman doing this film.I was very curious to know how the makers will keep the mundane narrative alive for more than 2 hours. Then after the movie runtime, I was very satisfied for the film to see how it evolved out of its own mediocrity like an underdog, and making me realize yet again how unpredictable and magical this medium is, it was indeed marvelous!The magic recipe lies in the characters- simple, relatable, lovable, gullible people. The key protagonist Mimi has a predictable graph (thanks to the trailer) still Mimi looks so credible on-screen through her mannerisms - the practical no-nonsense girl, the dare to dream big, and the courage to take control of her life no matter what, adding to that the Rajasthani slang (so organic) is how the soul of this film is presented, and no surprises, I'm hooked to the plot.The other aspect that works for the film is the setup where this story is placed, it looked fresh and believable. Mimi the movie is a dramatic rollercoaster, it has all emotional shades injected at every other interval to keep the viewers glued to the narrative, and that's one of the strengths of this film. There are many scenes that looked so simple, so trivial but they have managed to remain with me even after the movie. Kudos to the filmmaker Laxman Utekar, and the writers to pull this off so seamlessly.The film also carries a good ensemble cast that helps the plot not lose its grip and stays on track on the emotional meter. Mimi played by Kriti delivers a cracking performance, and is well supported by Pankaj Tripathi and Sai Tamhankar.Lastly, the music works wonders for this film, it is after a long time, I've really experienced the BGM gel so well with the narrative in Hindi Cinema, it really enhances the storytelling experience. It is good to see AR Rahman offered such films, and the filmmaker did a fab job in regularizing the musical element aptly into the narrative!On the flip side, the climax gets carried away on the dramatic level wherein I felt the side characters stranded like wooden dolls overdoing their emotional acts pointlessly. Finally, the character played by Pankaj Tripathi deserved more detailing, as I felt there was a tremendous scope in the second half to carve this character and bring out various possibilities to make this character even more likable, but no regrets.Mimi - A fascinating film, not to be missed!",Mimi

In my mind there are probably categories where I implicitly place the various actors and after this performance, Kriti Sanon has definitely made the leap to join actors who hold their own and give commanding performances as lead characters.

AR Rahman Music is so soothing to ears 😍 Only praises for this movie 🙌,Mimi
68,kooldddon,A film that leaves a lot to be desired!,6,27 July 2021,"Mimi written and directed by Laxman Utekar is based on the Marathi film 'Mala Aai vhhaychy!' The film follows the concept of foreign couples having child through surrogacy in India. Mimi played by Kriti is an aspiring actress living in a small town of Rajasthan where she does dance shows to one day fullfill her dreams of becoming an actress in Bollywood. Meanwhile a foreign couple is looking for a surrogate mother to bear their child and they meet Mimi through their driver Bhanu played by Pankaj. And hence the story progresses and writing anymore on it might prove to be a spoiler.I had high hopes from the film as it is a Maddock production. They always bring us some brilliant stories and films set in small towns and cities deeply grounded to reality and yet entertaining. The film's trailer and poster promised 'Nothing like what you are expecting'. But minutes into the film it becomes predictable of sorts. There are some deep issues regarding the entire concept of Surrogacy and the taboo associated with it which is never explored in the film. The film never quite tackles the big issues but relies entirely on emotions to do the trick. The film therefore felt a bit hollow and empty on that front for me. Probably a better writer and director would have worked wonders with this story, which is amazing.Coming to the good parts of the film, it blends comedy with emotions finely with the average screenplay at hand. The music by AR Rahman is amazing and goes well with the mood of the film. On the acting front Sanon gives her best performance till date. Pankaj as usual is funny and brilliant. Sai was grossly underused as Mimi's friend and so where Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak as Mimi's parents. The film does invoke genuine laughter with the dialogues and situations involved. But it leaves a lot to be desired. A film which could have been brilliant ends up being an average affair. But it still is a good and enjoyable watch if you lower your hopes. I had high expectations which has led to my disappointment with the film which might not be the case for you.",Mimi

71,sushant0406,Fairly average movie receiving praise due to the Hindi film industry's overall incompetence,3,3 August 2021,"Frankly, I went into this movie hoping to witness something special, but was disappointed. Compared to the Hindi movies being churned out today, Mimi was a good movie. But, compared to other regional cinema in India, it was bad and a difficult movie to bear when compared to movies of the same genre made outside India.The only highlight of this extremely boring, unrealistic and predictable movie was the ever-dependable Pankaj Tripathi. The man shone above the rest in both the dramatic scenes and the comedic sequences (impeccable timing).Kriti Sanon, definitely gave her career-best performance, but, that's not saying a lot in her case considering the low benchmark she had set with her performances in previous films.Manoj Pahwa, too was good in the role of Mimi's father. Seemed genuine.Rest of the cast members were forgettable, which is a pity. The direction was sporadically good. Editing seemed to be on point, but the excessive use of BGM to convey sentiments became overbearing.So, for those who have been exposed to a wide range of cinema, this movie is easily passable. A highly overrated movie in my opinion.",Mimi
72,sourya-mukherjee,A Kriti Sanon show 👌🏼,6,27 July 2021,"Without a shred of doubt, this certainly is the best work of Kriti Sanon till date. What expressions! She's funny in the first half and makes you laugh but the real punch is in the second half when even while sitting on the other side of the screen, you are able to feel her pain, her anger, her despire. In certain scenes she'll blow your mind off. The movie just shows, how the Indian film industry has matured and it's time for the ladies to take over the industry. The time for surnames are over. No more Khans & Kapoors. It's time to perform or perish. Pankaj Tripathi is brilliant as well and plays an excellent supporting role. The music in the movie is original & really soothing. That's like a breath of fresh air. If there's one weakness in the film, it's the storyline. While it builds up very well, I think it loses direction in the middle and lacks that knockout punch. Overall, it's a movie that definitely deserves a watch.",Mimi
73,SaanyaChopraDua,Mimi is NahiNahi (NoNo),1,27 July 2021,"Firstly, why isn't the Rating option for this Film available on the App itself? What games are these?Second, the movie is absolute junk. Bollywood created Stereotypes are used to the fullest.Stop promoting junk agendas in the name of Cinema.",Mimi
74,coolhunk55,Best acting of Kriti.,7,14 August 2021,Kriti has portrayed the role of an unmarried mother nicely. Her dialogues come clean and feel authentic. The movie has its share of funny and emotional scenes. Pankaj Tripathi as usual has done his role perfectly. Good fun and message.,Mimi
75,sonila-16235,Beautiful story,9,28 July 2021,I gave 1 star extra for making a movie on such an important topic. Surrogacy is becoming very common among the affluent of the society and yet we have little awareness of what kind of complications can arise out of it. I know this is a remake but I feel this kind of movie must be made in many languages so it reaches every corner of our country so any young woman who wants to be a surrogate mother can truly understand what she is getting into and take an informed decision. Movies as a medium are extremely powerful when communicating such ideas through effective storytelling.The movie excels in acting and music. Everyone has done their job perfectly. Beautiful ending.Couldn't really find any faults. Must watch!,Mimi
76,Avinava89,Weird AF storyline,5,1 August 2021,The story has plotholes than will engulf all your expectations.The cast did an amazing job as per acting is concerned.It is high on emotion but zero with logic.And the movie is unnecessarily long.,Mimi
77,ekta-srivastav,Overacting and no real substance,5,19 August 2021,The over the top positive reviews here are a bit confusing.... The premise is great and it's a lost opportunity ... All the actors suffer from poor direction as the acting is over the top and unnecessarily heavy on the drama ... The director has basically taken some amazing actors and made them look their worst possible .... Yawn fest ... AVOID.,Mimi
78,zahidbin-19256,I can't belive Bollywood finally did it..,10,27 July 2021,After so many years finally I can say bollywood was able to pulled of a great movie. The movie was flawless. The comedy and emotions were real not forced off. Every actor gave their 200% even the American actors were not just for show they did a great job in their respective part.So overall Mimi was a great product bollywood keep it up.,Mimi
79,badaamit,Plot,8,27 July 2021,Once again Pankaj Tripathi & Kriti Sanon has proved that movie doesn't need any Hero(superstar) if your story is hero......,Mimi
80,akellashashank,A heartwarming take on surrogacy,8,28 July 2021,"Laxman Utekar's depiction of surrogacy by blending humor and emotion is highly effective , which indeed brought the roof down ( in a good way) and the way he shifted the tone of the movie from comedy to emotional(vice versa) in a blink of an eye is what makes this one standout. Humor gonna surely tickle your funny bones, as it has plethora of laugh out loud moments to enjoy and at the same time, it even makes you emotional. ARR soothing music elevated the movie feel.Coming to performances , I would first like to talk about my favorite Kriti Sanon, she lived, owned the role Mimi like a queen and it is her finest and accomplished performance till date. She gonna receive accolades from all the corners, such is the act. I'm so happy for her and glad that she accepted this role, she knocked it out of the park and Pankaj Tripathi ji, give him any role, he just takes it to a notch higher with his grounded and earnest performance. As Bhanu, he gave his best as always and did supported Kriti in every possible way along with Sai Tamhankar who is another asset to the movie, she is too good as Shama. Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak , they're proved actors and did a wonderful job yet again. Special mention to Evelyn Edwards and Aidan Whytock, as every time we get foreign actors but performances tends to be normal but these two people are pretty impressive. Entire cast makes you invest your time and brings a smile on your face.Its been quite a sometime since I had a gala time throughout, what a ride. Giving this one an eight for Kriti and Pankaj, they deserve it.",Mimi

85,uqbaankhan,Ummmm an okay film with Great Performances!,6,16 September 2021,"I honestly had much much expectations with ""Mimi"" but I believe, it's somehow overrated.The Storyline is not much tough or maybe it's dragged.It's should be rated something between 7.0-7.3).Visually, it's okay. Not bad. Shots are good but not greater than Stree.Positives:
1-Acting of Pankaj Tripathi is just phenomenal as usual.2-Acting of rest of the cast is good. Kriti was fab.3-Last 15-20 mins are good and quite emotional and lovingly good.",Mimi
86,mystiquebhusri,Pankaj Tripathi nails it!,7,27 July 2021,Pankaj Tripathi delivers a fantastic performance yet again but that's the only thing that's sane about the film!Kriti sanon tries too hard but misses at most of the points.Still this film deserves the praise for how the story is shown and in future we need to have more female centric films.A good try by Bollywood but could've pushed way harder!,Mimi

89,docpal,The concept of surrogacy was intense but the portrayal isn't entirely true,1,1 August 2021,"The concept of surrogacy was intense, but portraying such a concept based on American couples hunting a surrogate mother is only biased for Indian audience, the possibilities equivalents to finding a needle in a haystack. Then comes the melodrama regarding losing the child which is utter non sense. As of a large number of surrogate mothers not only in India but around the globe knows the consequences before accepting the job. A job is a job and this where the truth lies. Probably a good definition of Indian melodrama but not realistic enough. This is where this film degrades itself.",Mimi

The movie did not stand out. The songs resembled just about any other lame Bollywood movie. Bhanu, Mimi, Shama we're all strong characters but the writers had to ruin it. Why? Why did the movie suddenly skip to four years later? One second we are watching a comical exchange between Bhanu and his (real) wife, the very next scene shows a grown up little boy getting bullied for being too white?What's worse is that the story had potential. The movie had a great plot. It is sad to see Bollywood makers trade good writing/story telling for a few bucks. Stop taking great stories and turning them into feel good movies!

109,illumiinati,It's a Kriti Sanon show!!,10,27 July 2021,"A good and entertaining hindi movie, in a while.Story is about a girl(Kriti Sanon), an aspiring actress from small indian town, who agrees to be a surrogate mother for an American couple. And what happens when that couple decide to abandon her due to some unforeeen circumstances. How she deals with it, forms the rest of the story.The execution of the plot is very engaging. The movie keeps you glued to the screen for its entire runtime. Screenplay and dialogues are crisp and applaud worthy.Performances by each and every cast member is terrific. Sai Tamhanakar leaves a mark. Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak are adorable as Mim's parents. Pankaj Tripathi is excellent and almost steals the thunder in every scene he is.But it's Kriti Sanon who just wins you over with her range of emotions. She shines and shines bright in every scene she is in. She brings Mimi to life. Watch her acting during the child birth scene and you would be in awe. The fact that she stands out in midst of some of India's finest actors, says a lot about her.The American actors are good too.Blemishes? Very minor. The characterization of John and Summer could have been better developed. Some of their motivations don't make sense. Length could have been shortened by 10-15 mins. The culmination is very predictable and convenient. Makers could have been a little more creative. But that aside this is great cinema.Recommended!",Mimi
110,rrdeo22,Very good.,8,30 July 2021,"Good - great acting performances, beautiful music, engaging and our favourite- Pankaj Tripathi.Bad - Few plot holes, Pahwa and Pathak were little under-utilised.Special mention - KRITI SENON !!!!",Mimi

112,dannair,Could have been a little better,7,27 July 2021,The actors carry this film on their shoulders. The direction and editing however leaves a lot to be desired. There are comedic scenes that seem to over stay their welcome (esp the scene where Bhanu's wife comes to confront him) and there are several scenes where the camera zoom into the faces of supporting actors for dramatic effects (at one point its almost comical that the camera keeps pointing at Manoj Phawa and Pathak's face for no reason). Despite the flaws its still watchable and it does makes an emotional impact.,Mimi

But I was wrong, Kriti Sanon pulled off the character so well, but that dialect could have been better.A tale of surrogacy, which starts with humour drama and becomes really emotional. This emotional that I was literally going to cry.Laxman Utekar has done a very good job of showing beautiful locations in the films, beauty of Rajasthan.This dialogue by Pankaj Tripathi is like the perfect dialogue to sum up lot of things which the movie was all about""Kabhi kabhi asaan hota hai mar jana

130,sharengon,8.5???!!,3,13 August 2021,"This movie does not deserve more than a 3. This movie is extremely insensitive and show many negative messages to society.First of all, it is inaccurate. Looks like the director completely forgot about doing research. Foreigners being surrogate are not allowed since 2015. Also unmarried girl is not allowed to be a surrogate. Some people said oh but this takes place before 2015, but then why does the director not tell the audience that this is not the case now. He is spreading misinformation. Second of all, legally it was a mess too. First, contract is required and couple cannot abandon the baby like that. So at the end, when the couple is saying about legal action I was like they must be very foolish because commercialized surogacy is a crime so they will go to jail for that, also they abandoned their child which is a punishment of 10 years. I think in the end, they decided to adopt because they did not want to end up in jail for their CRIME.Here are some great lessons I learned from watching this movie (sarcastic)1. First, when the male foreigner is on the phone with a surrogate agency in UP (illegal agency), the women are referred to as ""stock"". Great! So much respect they are receiving.2. The baby is white. Everyone says, wow wow this baby is so beautiful because he is fair. So, the villagers are trying to figure out how to produce a fair child. From this we can learn that only fair people are beautiful and dark people are ugly.3. Parents don't want daughter to marry Muslism man. Wow, this is called Unity in Diversity.4. Main lead is glorified for abandoning her dreams in the name of sacrifice for her child. From this we can learn that a woman cannot be both a mother and complete her dreams. Yes, this film is definitely a woman empowerment film.5. In the movie, the woman says ""If killing your child after birth is a crime, and killing your child isn't a crime??"" Great, blame the pregnant woman who wants to abort without understanding her situation.Good things:
Engaging plot
Great acting by Kriti Sanon, when she gives birth it felt almost real

Kriti did good as well.For the movie, I am not sure in a country like India, if its allowed to have surrogacy with an unmarried woman, but then as shown in this movie that they hide it from family and friends cuz big money is involved.There were few other loopholes in the movie but that really does cover up with other entertainment parts.Overall a good movie to watch with your family.",Mimi

138,sonjitmukherjee,Balanced and compact story telling with a deep message.,9,27 July 2021,"A well written and nicely executed movie with fantastic casting. Perfectly balanced story telling. Pankaj Tripathi as usual has been at his best, and did complete justice to his role. And, this has to be the best performance of Kriti sanon in her career following Bareilly ki barfi. And yes, you just cannot complain anything about music when A. R Rahman is the music director.",Mimi
139,princesabraham,Unmet expectations,5,28 July 2021,"The movie showed promise with it's trailer and the names attached to it. Unfortunately the movie fails to live up to the expectations.The movie starts and moves very fast without a proper character establishment which would otherwise had helped in the latter part of the movie. As the connection with the main lead fails to be established, the emotional portions latter falls flat. This causes the 2nd half to feel dragged and with no direction. The emotion we should otherwise have had for the main lead is just not there. The comedy works in bits and pieces. The story had a good base but unfortunately the proceedings don't do justice to the thought that the makers had set out to tell. Despite all these flaws, the climax does make your eyes teary but wish it had come sooner.Kriti shines in the movie and Pankaj is good as usual. Unfortunately all other talents are wasted.Music and the BGM stands out.Watchable once.",Mimi

Pankaj Tripathi along with other co-stars have also done a great job. But the film is slow, the trailer was more funny.

157,shubhampohekar,A Tale of mother's unconditional love,10,27 July 2021,"This is the best film I seen in recent years from Bollywood. This will literally make u cry. The film tells us about human emotions and how our Indian culture values morals over money. Mimi keeps the child even when it's biological parents ask to abort it. Mimi's parents also supports her , that's the most beautiful thing. The showed us that just giving birth don't make u a mother but how u raise makes u one. The film showed different shades of human nature , their are no villian or heroes, they showed the shades of humans.. all charecters are written beautifully that u connect with everyone. The performance are awesome, especially Kriti sanon gave her career best performance. The child is really cute. Pankaj tripathi makes u laugh whenever he comes.. overall this is a must watch.. especially in today's age of propoganda movies .. it's rare to see such a cute human story made with love and innocence.",Mimi

162,ambivert_idiot,A perfect family pack,8,2 August 2021,"Mimi is a good comedy-drama movie full of entertainment, positivity, and emotions as well. It starts with showing a foreign couple who visit India to find a cheap surrogate. Mimi (Kriti Sanon) accepts the offer for a certain amount of money in order to make her career in acting by going to Mumbai. Later, the couple decides they don't want the child and abandon Mimi when she's pregnant. And then, this story takes too many turns in Mimi's life. The story is full of comedy as well as emotions. Pankaj Tripathi did a brilliant job in this movie. Kriti Sanon also worked hard and showed her talent.The movie shows a middle-class girl's dreams and her will to fulfill them at any cost. Bhanu (aka Pankaj Tripathi), a cab driver, always be with Mimi even during her worst situation, and even his small glimpses impact the movie. The role of Mimi's mother was also too much impressive. She showed the norms of the society by her acting, and also, the emotions for her daughter were quite sensible. Overall, the movie makes sense in all aspects.Cast is greatSongs are greatStory is greatDialogues are greatActing skills of all actors are greatSocial Message is presentComedy of humour is presentFamily movie: YesNow, what do you waiting for?

172,charmedones-14307,Great and Emotional!,10,27 September 2021,"I probably should have written this review when I watched it, but had been going through something.That said, Mimi was an excellent movie that I wish more people saw globally, emotional, fanastic cast set up and story. It ended differently then I thought it would, and I am glad. The main actress Kriti acted these scenes out. Pankaj was an good casting choice as well, I loved how he wasn't the love interest but he was the understanding friend and became family, including his wife who eventually came to an understanding. All of the actors honestly deserve a good rating, I am not sure there was a bad one among them. I love the family aspect, that once everyone understood what happened, they all accepted their roles.There was some humor, and some emotional scenes. The two white characters John and Summer were also good casting choices, usually when I see white characters in Indian movies, they don't really have much lines or if they do, it sounds dubbed and very hard to understand them. However the two actors who played them did it well, you like them first, then hate the characters but eventually happy with the way they realised their mistakes. I still laugh at Summer speaking in Hindi when the two main leads didn't think she could understand them, because you wouldn't normally expect a white person to learn Hindi enough to understand them.I really thought they were going to tear the kid away and end up ruining it for Kriti's character, but at the end they came through and adopted another child. Sadly, it isn't unheard of western countries also wanting to leave their child due to a disability.Definitely would watch again knowing what happens now, and I love the message at the end about adopting children. And again, I hope this becomes a global movie everyone enjoys, watch it with subtitles, because Pankaj, Kriti.and Sai in specific deserve to be seen.",Mimi

180,nivesingh,"refreshing movie after a long, long time",2,5 August 2021,"This is a simple story, well acted by entire cast. The casting director has chosen the cast well, all including the little boy Raj and the American couple, suit their roles perfectly. Mimi's parents play their parts well, Pankaj Tripathi is also good but he doesn't stand out. Story as some unrealistic things as all typical bollywood movies, for example, how can an aspiring actress agree to be a surrogate mother- she had a divorcee best friend who was perfect for that but no, she agreed to be the surrogate! The songs were dull and unnecessary and I fast forwarded through all the songs. Rehman has lost his Roja magic. As of all typical bolywood potboilers, script has forcefully added parts to make the m'slim community look good, though the narrative does not require it. This movie is surprisingly good compared to all the recent bollywood movies which have been disappointing. The ending is very good, it makes it worth watching for the duration of 2 hrs 12 mins. Though thereis nothing spectacular in this movie, the timing of release, after a spate of over the top flops, will ensure that this movie becomes a hit.",Mimi

I think I haven't seen better performance of Pankaj Tripathi as compared to his performance in this movie. The movie of Greed, Surrogacy, two Mothers, and a child who is loved by everyone. I think the best performance in this movie was neither by Kriti ma'am nor by Pankaj sir but by the child who played the role of Raj, Kriti's son. I request bollywood to not make any sequel of this movie as this would lead to decrease in love for this one as we know most of the sequels are worse than the original one.

It's an second film after Good newz that giving message.Next, casting: in my view, all the actors has casted aptly. Kriti Shannon top - notch performance has stolen the show accompanied by Pankaj Tripathi.

The director Laxman Utekar, needs a huge credit to put all of this together.It's not easy to not get overwhelmed by AR's music, and not let it affect the narrative.And he has attained that, the music beautifully blended with the movie, and took the narrative to another level.The climax scene, the one where Mimi gives birth and holds the baby for the first time, were accenuated by Rahman Sir's music.A complete movie, with a mix of clean unforced comedy, and simple and believable emotions.A perfect balance was stuck in all ground.Kriti Sanon also has lived the role of Mimi. There was a lot of publicity for her 15kg or so weight gain and all. But her performance was much much beyond that.A superlative performance, very effectivey supported by Pankaj Tripathi, Sai Tamhankar, Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak.This movie certainly needs another watch :) Weekend plans done :D.",Mimi

The story was overall okay and well implemented on screen. As for acting it was quite good and music soothing. Further, more films should be produced focusing on children in orphanages which could be documentaries or associated with real-life events or anything else thus bringing the situation of thiers to Indian masses and urging them for adoption as a better option although media is equally responsible but nowadays they only run government propaganda.",Mimi

238,shadikabir,A cute kid and an endearing cast carry Utekar's brain'child',8,26 July 2021,"A highly endearing tale of a young girl who starts to feel the repercussions and challenges of surrogacy. There was a lot of hype around this film when the promotions and trailer released, and rightly so. There is definitely a case which can be made for people not enjoying the film as much as it should, since there was a couple of quirky comedic moments in the trailer, and not much more here. As we progress further into the second half the emotional quotient holds even stronger. Here, I argue where the film is stronger. The shocking questions asked of the characters and their mental battles of morality and good futures are played off amazingly, if not slightly under the magic of A. R Rahman's compositions. The music may be understated for a film of this scale, but the beautiful accompaniments show the direction in which the director wishes to further his filmmaking essence, compared to his previous fully commercial-oriented venture. This is definitely a worthy follow up to Luka Chuppi, not in the comedic space, but the messaging and true filmmaking. Don't get me wrong, the comedic moments that the supporting cast provide are nothing short of hilarious, albeit few. However, the day is still to come where Bollywood strays away from the repetitive Hindu-Muslim confusions for humorous moments - think to Aparshakti Khurrana's role in Luka Chuppi, and even Pati Patni Aur Woh. This type of humour needs a major facelift, and fast. It doesn't detract from the experience though. I can wholeheartedly say this is one of Kriti Sanon's most accomplished performances, and for that alone it needs to be watched. If not for that, then at least for Pankaj Tripathi - the old and reliable!",Mimi
239,shariqkarim,Excellent everything,10,22 August 2021,"Kriti senon is one rising star....

The movie is filled with emotions , wheather it's sadness or happiness this film is packed with all emotions. From tears dropping from my eyes to a big fat smile , all was present with me while watching this movie. Though it has been a remake of a movie but it has not missed to give the viewers the pleasure they needed after watching a movie. Not a doubt the acting skills of sir pankaj tripathi was great as always but even kriti sanon impressed me in this film. Even the songs of this film got the same standards as the fantastic storyline, The best song to me was ""RIHAYI DE"" sung by none other then the great musician A. R . Rahman which was just mesmerising for the ears. On top of it all this movie is not going to disappoint anyone but infact This movie will make your day!!!",Mimi

270,drhemantsant,Acceptance gives you a joy,7,15 September 2021,"Film Review: Mimi 2021
Dr Hemant A Sant Vadodara
Entertainment means amusement, Pleasure, leisure, relaxation, Refreshment Or a distraction. A Film must do all or any of the above. Film Mimi does that for a message. It may not reveal whole science or truth. This is a story telling by its team of creators. Script direction acting camera location reveals unique individuals and their lives.Acceptance is its first message. See the twisted convoluted plot reveal that the moment we accept and open our hearts and minds to the new changes and its obvious solutions life offers all will be well. Till a new day shines!If along with unique story telling a person or event sparks a debate within us it becomes more meaningful. Straight forward way is to deliver direct message. 'This is better than That' .Debate this film should surely provoke. Surrogacy is the topic.The childless couples have many alternatives which todays science offers. One of it is using other women's womb body to grow couples lab made test tube embryo. That has many facets-sentimental ,social and ethical issues. More Money is needed.The dreams of a Girl from typical Indian home change as event unfolds. Mimi and her family accepts the changes and challenges to find bliss grace . 'The Others' too accept the change at the very end and show us a beacon of hope for a joy that can be yours if you shed bias of limited identity of self.What are the twisted lanes of Surrogacy and its easier alternative needed some more science or sentiment than this film manages to reveal. Script could have easily revealed facets of science behind the twist the story has been given.Those screening Tests are undergone by all pregnant Women today before a red timeline is crossed. The women of today have choices offered by science .Hiding behind a false positive test has been back bone of many a Indian film scripts which this film creators too succumb to. They need not have. Repeat the Test. Take second opinion. But let us give creative freedom to its makers -Laxman Utekar and Rohan Shankar. Original Story by Samruddhi Porey(Mala Aai Vhay chayy-I want to be a Mother) in Marathi.The will of the Girl Mimi Rathore of Rajasthani Shekhavati village who is left to fend for herself is well enacted by Kriti Sanon. Her 'charioteer' is Bhanu Pandey -well enacted by Pankaj Tripathi .He is a Delhi Tourist Driver looking for easy money to survive. The way he too metamorphosizes into a different person is side spice of the story.Supriya Pathak and Manoj Pahwa as parents are epitome of the virtue of acceptance. Glam Girl Sai Tamhankar excels as Shama -a muslim maulvi's talaq victim and best friend of Mimi.Bhanu and Shama virtually hold 'pregnant for Money' - Mimis hand as life reveals a roller coaster testing times for her.Evelyn Edwards as Summer and Aidan Whytock as John are given adequate screen to reveal the vaccilitating moods and anguish of a couple who see no other choice than surrogacy.In the end they find there is an easier option that can give them joy. That it also gives a new life to child already born but has no one to care is the main message from this film. Millions of children are waiting to be adopted. Remove all bias of skin and race as you accept adoption. The child which arrives in the house converts it into a true Home. Its presence electrifies a whole bunch of People with different hues in one common positive Colour of Joy!That joy stays with you after the film ends for a time enough to wash out biases we all have been growing with.What Mimi got or what happens next is left to our imagination to accept complexities of life where one plus one may not be a two. Leave Me-Me and accept MIMI or We-We!Story is what stays back in your store .",Mimi
271,birjubhatt,Emotional and refreshing....makes you laugh and cry and laugh again,8,27 July 2021,"A rare movie which you can watch with your entire family and enjoy.Unique subject of surrogacy blend with individual aspiration and dreams of various people of different age and background. Story begins in very light mode and slowly you get attached to characters. It takes you on roller coaster ride of laugh and cry, joyful and sadness, makes you anxious and force to think too.No gaali or guns or kiss and yet it can entertain.And yes, Kriti Sanon can act.

But maybe we don't praise him too much because nowadays we're used to pankaj tripathi amazing performances. We know he is the best.Only reason I didn't give 10 because I'm not fully satisfied with the look and performance of the little boy. He was good.

Great casting and very apt representation of all the leads and actors. Watch it for light hearted and hilarious comic sequences by Pankaj Tripathi - he is at his best AND Kriti has acted very well; have done a great justice to her part - doesn't seem out of cast for even a single frame.

This movie explored the true acting skills of Kriti other those rubbish ones she did earlier. No words about the performance of Pankaj sir, words are less for that legend. All others also performed very good and they did play a significant part in the movie. In short terms, this was the best bollywood movie of this year. Must watch.",Mimi
333,debasishpadhy-12521,A family drama,9,28 July 2021,"A family drama filled with happy moments, sad moments and lots of funny moments. It is a must watch movie.Well to start with the movie it has great scope to be one of the best in terms of story (fresh), writing (laugh in every 2min), music (related to story) and acting ( by everyone).An over used thought in hindi cinema, where a small town girl wanna be HEROIN and make it big on the silver screen. This is the sad part, almost all of us end up doing something totally opposite in life. Life does take this kind of turns to test your guts. Situations force us to go through the test so so that you can pursue the dream but in that test some get success, some fail like Mimi in the movie.It is a different story and Laxman Utekar has given his best.Kriti Sanon has definitely making her mark and promising that she is going to be here for long time. The graph of her character went uphill from the begining and there is never a scene where she failed to impress. Such a bold step to commit to such a unique story and make it look even better on screen. What a performance.Pankaj Tripathi is now a new charm in the movies. The realistic reaction every time he come on the screen makes him very likable. He is among those actors who do not need chiseled body to make the character look strong. He has reached new height and totally justified the role.The supporting star cast has done excellent job to make the movie look complete.I loved the movie and would definitely recomond to watch it.",Mimi

Kriti Seno has done a good job and specially her look of Banarasi girl is very well done.But the show stealer is once again Pankaj Tripathi by his simple, effortless but yet elegant and superb acting.The best part was that some advancement shown in the movie where the family and society accepts the unmarried girl with a baby bump which is really needed.And the humanity of Pankaj Tripathi also was well drafted.It should had been a 6* but 1extra for acting of Pankaj Tripathi.",Mimi
387,sharbeen,The performance of the two Americans and the kid was annoying,8,27 July 2021,I enjoyed this movie. But few things bothered me. The kids voice was dubbed and wasn't arranged well and that bothered me. The acting of the two Americans wasn't great either especially when Summer speaks in Hindi she is just blank from expression and looked really awful and fake.Some of the drama was way too much and unnecessary killing the flow of the movieBesides that everyone else acted absolutely brilliant and it was entertaining.

2. Dialogues by mimis muslim friend like ""mere abbu maulavi he. Masjid de baahar aate nahi aur me masjid ja nahi sakti "" & ""mere pati me mujhe 3 talak keh ke chhod diya "" which shows regressive and patriarchy of pieceful society.3. Mimi sticks to the culture values and doesn't go for abortion

I had zero expectations from it . The main reason was its trailer , as it revealed everything . So I was in a dilemma that whether to watch it or not but since it had Pankaj Triphati in it , I decided to give it a shot and let me tell you I was surprised !! Mimi is beautiful and rarely feels boring . It is perfect in every sense. The comical scenes are just hilarious !! And by comedy I don't mean those double meaning jokes . It's actually good ( the comedy) as it feels natural. The dialogues are just superb !! Especially that one from Pankaj Tripathi, ""I'm a driver Mimi ji . We have some principles ......"" and there is one more dialogue said by an supporting actress ( I don't know her name actually) which is ,"" Life is not what we think , Life is that what we live .""
The soundtrack by A. R Rahman ...... SOOTHING !!!!!!Especially 'Rihayi de' and 'param sundari' . Also the acting of all the cast members especially PANKAJ TRIPHATI !!!!! Man what an actor ! Just brilliant. He's excellent in comic scenes but brilliant In emotional scenes . Kriti Sanon is definitely the highlight. She's proved that why she deserves to be here .. she's just awsome as the Small town girl who aspires to be an actor . Also special mention for Evelyn Edwards , Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak .On the whole , Mimi is an excellent film and a great tribute to all the mothers out there . Just don't miss it !!!!!",Mimi

Story, screenplay n direction: story n screenplay are adapted, though I don't think we've watched original. But definitely it is known that they've made changes to the screenplay of the movie. Dialogues are really nice, screenplay is not predictable. The story looks realistic and sets add more realistic feel to it. Direction is really good. The movie is crisp and length couldn't have been shortened than this. There's a good balance of comedy, feelings and emotions what director has cleverly managed so the audience never feel bored, even for a second.Acting :- pankaj tripaathi nails his role, adding comedy. Kriti Sanon has also done amazing work, making it her one of the best performances. Manoj Pahwa, Sai Tamhakar, Supriya pathak are a delight to watch proving their worth. The American actors have also acted well.Music n bgm:- A. R Rahman sir, the name is enough. But really, rockabye bye bye, O chidiya re, param sundari, rihaayi de, really add more flavors to the movie. So well composed n produced by Rahman sahab. Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics add more feathers to the music, amitabh ji, being a great lyricist.The technical aspects of the movie are really above good, and it would not be wrong to call the movie technically sound. Yes, I could note some mistakes, but, no movie is without a little mistake.On a whole, Mimi is a complete package to be enjoyed, just not for its story or direction, but also for the acting, music, bgm and technical details. Definitely can be watched with family. It surely deserved a theatrical release so that cinema lovers could enjoy in a cinema Hall.",Mimi

656,aspirantjee,"Best ever Film for both entertainment, and ultimate moral",10,5 October 2021,"To be really honest, I am not a die hard fan of the present Bollywood generation. Came here for Pankaj Tripati, stayed for the end, it was truly unexpectable, the ending brings you goosebumps and the whole film is glorified with the best acting and plot of the story. The primary aim of this film was to showcase that you should never judge your child simply on the basis of his physical and external charecter or appearance, it is your duty to look after him/her and nurture it. Dislikers are those kids who just come for masala sort of entertainment and feel bored to see Non-Salman or Non-SRK films.I will rate this a 10 because of the Great Pankaj Tripati, the plot of the story, the execution, the ultimate moral and overall production 👍🏻",Mimi

661,nitinkumar-verma,Kriti shines and Pankaj Tripathi is the moon guiding in night,10,30 July 2021,The casting couldn't have been any better than this to live up to expectations. Kriti has proved she alone can drive the story to next level. Pankaj never ceases any opportunity to make you laugh or make you feel intensity of plot. This has been one of the best storytelling I've witnessed. The story strongly proves it's worth as we dive deeper. Mimi does make sure you sit tight the whole runtime.A must watch.Made my eyes moist but with a larger than expectation smile.The compositions complement the plot.Love the direction.Wouldn't be a surprise if they bag many awards.,Mimi

683,prashhaanth,Fine not bad,6,26 July 2021,"Well First things first I didn't have any expectations from this film but it turned out fine, it could have used a little more humor and cut the melodrama down but it's a good entertainer, and finally it's also film where the American characters speak like Americans, in some other Indian films they speak like Russian hippies. If you are planning to watch this film then please don't watch the trailer because the trailer gives all the big reveals and twists away and also don't have a lot of expectations this is just a Bollywood masala film done right in a long time!",Mimi

702,iamhasnain,At par with Badhai ho,9,26 July 2021,"This is my first review of any movie. I think Mimi is kind of a movie which is in the class of Badhai ho, Dum laga le haisha, paglait etc.As expected Pankaj Tripathi delivers effortlessly. Kirti has improved a lot and rest of the cast does their job. What also gets noticed is the performance of the foreign couple. The storyline is simple yet engaging. In the climax you will find it difficult to take a side. Or, at least it was for me😀It's a movie which starts on surrogacy and makes path through bonding and love. The humour is cherry on the cake. These kind of movies are keeping the essence of Indian Cinema alive. A must watch!!!",Mimi

713,amitbala-75215,Definately worth every sec to watch,10,28 July 2021,"Don't believe in any negative reviews, this movie is really worth your watch time. Despite it is a remake of Marathi movie ""Mala Aai Vahhaychy!"", it creates a different flavor than the original. Surely Kriti Sanon's best performance till now. Pankaj Tripathi done best what he is known for and Sai Tamhankar surely making her strong presence in bollywood with this act.",Mimi

719,prithwirajdas-55531,EMOTION OVER COMMEDY,10,26 July 2021,"It is almost a complete attempt with a time worthy social msg and awareness regarding surrogacy... No doubt best ever performance by kriti Sanon so far and perfectly complemented by Pankaj sir... A well written and well executed story will surely make you travel through roller coaster of incidents full of COMMEDY and unforseen incidents and it will end surely making you emotional..
My take 10/10 for a perfect decent movie of recent times
MUST WATCH.",Mimi
720,karniksun,Beautiful movie!!,10,5 August 2021,Enjoyed every minute of the movie. Every actor has delivered their part in perfection. Thank you for making this movie.,Mimi
721,yajnaramdonee,ain't that bad,6,14 August 2021,"Among all the horrible bollywood movies, this one wasn't so bad. A few fixes here and there in the movie would've made it so much better.For example a backstory of the American couple and their struggle to have a baby (and maybe a concrete reason as to why they don't want a child who is mentally challenged especially if it's theirs because as far as I know some would cherish a kid if they want one and can't conceive) . That would make us more sympathetic towards them instead of them being a bank account and some sort of monster in the end. A few minutes of Summer and John going places to places, but being disappointed each time would've definitely helped.At the same time a flashback of bhanu's struggle could've been shown to the audience, adding depth to the already quite decent character.A particular part I'm quite disappointed with is the ending. It was too rushed. Bhanu could've easy asked the couple why they didn't want to adopt at the beginning since (I guess) that was the 'moral' of the story. And mimi could've easily argued that they can get any healthy child that is already born and leave her Raj since he has Down Syndrome.",Mimi
722,ahadkhanpashtoon,best movie,10,8 August 2021,Excellent movie produced by laxman extremly beautifull movie everything was there drama comedy emotion. Pankaj thripati and krithi sanon nailed it out.thanks netflix brilliant movie i cannot explain in a review.,Mimi

724,intodiayug,Amazing Bollywood Movie After A Long Time,9,10 August 2021,It started With Laughter 😂😂 and ended emotionally 😢😢. The combination Of laughter with emotions was the best and perfectly balanced .Whenever the scene became intense and emotional it suddenly changed into a funny situation. And that was the best part of the movie .As always Pankaj Tripathi rocked and Kirti sanon's performance was outstanding. The Foreign also did very well and specially the foreign lady spoke in Hindi and it didn't looked like dubbed or something over it was perfect .At Last Overall The movie Was classic and best movie after a long time in Bollywood .,Mimi

Problem is that people except too much twist and turns and so blame the movie , i want to ask them if putting an alien angle on it would make them feel good...
This movie is too good, watch it for urself and get lost in thier world ..",Mimi
727,theworldoffantasticfour,Needed a better story line,5,27 July 2021,"The concept of the story is good , but I am unhappy with the American Actors for the film. Its not fair for a couple to abandon a surrogate just because the child she is carrying tested positive for downs syndrome , why would parents consider doing that to a human being? The callous attitude of the parents after knowing the consequences of a pregnancy , is utterly ridiculous , not even to forget mentioning the societal consequences of a woman bearing a child out of wedlock. After 4 years they come back to take their son , even though they ran out on him in the first place?! And legal action? Take legal action on a child they abandoned ? Wow! Talk about how selfish they are.Atleast the ending was fine , but this really is awfu.",Mimi

Not only that, they manage to mix in just the right amount of intelligent comedy and emotion.The film itself is very entertaining, with Kriti Sanon delivering perhaps the best performance of her career. I would be very disappointed if she does not win an award or two for her incredible acting skills. Pankaj Tripathi's brilliance only makes the movie so much more lovable.Well done everyone! Brillant movie!P. S. Very annoyed with negative reviews from so-called ""critics"". Please go get a real job and do something useful.

It beautifully potrays the journey of a dancer girl named mimi who has big dreams of making it to bollywood one day and will break through any limitations to achieve her big dream.Its socially viable message brings out the undeniable and unfortunate truth of today's mind set and sweetly tries to break some stigmas associated with child development and child birth. It also successfully represents the emotions and oneness of Indian families that go to any depth to support their family members.It's really funny & quirky and Has a great star cast that brings out a sweet message to the public. I cannot imagine why it took this long for me to watch this movie, but I'm glad I did. It's truly unique and hopefully the start to many more such different stories that one could actually connect with in terms of our current society and lifestyles. It's an example of ingenuity and brilliance. Finally.",Mimi

Made me think about our parents and especially our mothers who go through a lot! From the first half of the movie to the end it was a emotional roller coaster! Fantastic.,Mimi
1087,monajaved,A little over dramatic but enjoyable to watch,6,18 August 2021,Mimi starts off comedically and captures the users interests early on. However the second half feels a bit too stretched out and over dramatic (especially the ending).This is the first time that I have watched Kriti Sanon in a movie and she didn't disappoint. She fully embodies the character of Mimi. I felt her acting was very natural. The supporting cast were all pretty great.Personally I feel the kid going back to his biological parents and Mimi getting back to her career would have been a better move. It just didn't make any sense for Summer to adopt another girl when their child is right there. That would probably have been less dramatic and Mimi could have continued to meet (instead of raise) Raj throughout the years. Also how come the American couple didn't adopt in the last 4 years is beyond my understanding especially since they seemed so open to the idea of it.,Mimi

Really funny and emotional.I am giving 10 out of 10 for this movie. Some of you may think that 6 or 9 is sufficient. But I'd liek to give 10 the acting, story, social concerns and a positive message. A lot of goodness can wash away the bad things. So 10/10.Most of the credit should go to the story, trhe acting by Pankaj and Kriti and all other great actors. Everyone served justice to their roles.I became a fan of Kriti in Bareily ki Barfi and this movie has made me love her even more with respect to her acting skills.Pankaj Tripathi ji's acting by default is excellent as always. He really chose his best character.Bollywood should really support such actors and only then it will revive it's shine and fan base.

The performance of Kriti sanon, Pankaj Tripathi and Sai Tamhankar deserves an applause. Even though the movie is completely focused on the journey of the character Mimi The director had given space for each and every character introduced through out this movie including a not so important character named Atif.Even though I'm not a fan of Bollywood movies I would suggest this movie to everyone who read this review.

Got some time today to watch this film ""Mimi"", of which I've heard so much from the social medias.This has to be one of the best films I've watched over the course of years. The acting was top notch, the best. I didn't know Kriti Sanon that much, as I had seen just one movie of her in the past. I was blown way by her 10/10 acting, she completely nailed the role of a young woman passionate about her career and also as a surrogate mother. I don't have much to say about Pankaj, he had been amazing in the past, and he didn't fail this time as well.The story was quite simple, but the director emphasized on the finest details of life in this film. At times it was hilarious as hell, but not forced at all. I always crave natural puns and humors, and this film had it all.Also, some critics are bombing this movie with undeserving criticisms. To them, get a life! Go ** ***! You guys can never enjoy anything in life. Not a single part of the movie was depicted towards any form of insult or injustice towards anyone.",Mimi

1114,R_2004,Train wreck,1,9 August 2021,"How the hell this movie is rated so high is beyond me. The story had potential but in what world Down syndrome diagnosis is done at full term pregnancy? The scene where doctor communicates to her about Down syndrome, FL seems like she is in her third trimester. The inaccuracy reflects badly on medical profession. Then girl continuously lying to her parents while her parents were so supportive showed how selfish and delusional she was. Overall bad story line full of usual drama with non sensical events.",Mimi

1121,bunnypsy,Perfect movie to watch,8,2 August 2021,"Mimi Story revolves around the surrogate mother whose biological parents abandon the surrogacy and the struggle she goes through.. Kriti Sanon for the first time she's going to be loved as an actress, instead of a model... Pankaj Tripathi , as usual is at his best as a character that drives the story initially and later adds humour and fun.. A. R. Rahman music score was good but the background score was flawless.. . Overall it is a beautiful film that deserves a watch.I recommend this movie to Pradip Karmakar Pijush Das Rony

1123,anshikaraiishu,LOVED IT!,10,30 July 2021,"Mimi is one of most revolutionary practical movie of bollywood till date. ""Parents banne k liye Bachcha janam dena zaruri nahi hota hai, and bachcha bada karne k liye, bachcha apka hona zaruri nahi hota"". This is the most evergreen moment that will stay with me forever... The sociopolitical remarks and the current situation of our society.. where we need to accept every kind of mother.. it really was one of the best moments from the movie. And Pankaj Tripathi's was as usual Excellent at his physical comedy. The thing that I couldn't continue to digest was the movie's stand on abortion. I definitely understand the circumstances but Kriti's remark on abortion felt totally out of context. Another thing was how the movie didn't go into much details about Down Syndrome. If the baby continued to live with the disability and then the parents would come back to take it then that would have made much more impact rather the way they played it out in the beginning made it seem like it was too easy for them to just come back one day and ask for their baby.",Mimi
1124,mehul-84778,A Gem,10,2 August 2021,This is an absolutely epic film that has come up. Kriti Sanon and Pankaj Sir have nailed their performances. I will ask everyone to definitely give it a watch and especially to those who are wasting their time on movies like Hungama 2.,Mimi

Kriti just didn't look like a small town girl who doesn't speak english or is uneducated. Her glossy look and not that great acting, just made a lot of scenes unbelievable.

You are sure to become her fan after this.Pankaj Tripathi, as usual is absolutely phenomenal! Seasoned actors like Supriya Pathak and Manoj Pahwa are delightful as well.

1190,yssa_number10000,"Nice acting, not so nice story",6,22 September 2021,"Very impressed with the acting in this movie. I found them to be believable and was not bothered with instances of overacting or melodrama as mentioned by some other reviewers. I did however have a strong dislike for the storyline with the Americans and in particular the ending. The movie shows how carelessly foreigners 'deal' with Indian wombs for hire and how the problems it can cause for young women when left to their own devices. I thus do not understand why the director chose to have the main actors showed gratitude in the end towards the Americans who left their child for four years because it was 'handicapped' and the woman who raised the child. I think it shows the wrong message to thank them when they suddenly decide to adopt an Indian girl. Children are not items for sale! What also dissapointed me was the revered way that motherhood is spoken of in the movie, the main character abandons all her dreams for raising a child and that is considered the only good choice? Yes motherhood is important and can be beautiful, but it is not the only or the best choice for a person to make. Also, abortion is healthcare, so the pro birth agenda (main character giving a passionate speech about there being no difference between a living, breathing child in the womb and a living breathing child outside the womb) is not only in bad taste but also factually wrong. In the end, a good subject for a movie, great performances, but the story really falls flat on more than one part.",Mimi

Manoj Pahwa has done a great job his character was amazing he played the role of mimi's father. Throughout the movie is emotional and serious but pankaj sir makes you laugh his comic timing is amazing. I am already a big fan of kriti but after this movie i am like the biggest fan of kriti.

1703,kutekakes,"Funny, emotional, packed with great performances.",9,28 July 2021,"Pankaj Tripathi is truly someone I would love to know personally.All his interviews make me appreciate him even more.He seems like a gem of a person and that honesty comes across beautifully on screen in every role he portrays.I think he is my most favourite actor through all the years of watching cinema.No exaggeration.In this movie too he gives a performance that's so endearing, natural and believable.He is so funny without even trying.I was actually cracking up!With Biyu (my 3year old daughter) asleep beside me!Thank God she didn't wake up!Kriti Sanon first surprised me in Bareilly ki Burfi and in this movie she totally out does herself.What an involved actor!Her performance was especially close to my heart because of my own experience of motherhood and all the emotions she portrayed during the birthing and then when she sees the baby and holds and feeds him for the first time - just transported me to my own birthing experience.It's so difficult to portray emotions you've never really experienced yourself in life.Especially having and holding your own baby for the first time.She moved me to tears.The on-screen chemistry between Kriti and Pankaj sir was of father and daughter in Bareilly ki Burfi and in Mimi, it is of strangers who become very important in each others' lives and it is so awesome to watch them transition so beautifully from movie to movie that you forget they once played father and daughter (which I was afraid wouldn't happen when I had watched the trailer)I totally loved the rest of the cast too.Sai Tamhankar, Manoj pahwa and Supriya Pathak are excellent in their roles.Who wouldn't want a friend and parents like them?!The only issue I had.I was dying for more people to speak up during the climax.Music was great and just right. Not overpowering at all. A. R. Rahman, I consider God of music anyway! And he proves why.All and all loved the film
Actual humour without abusive language or insults after so so long in Hindi cinemaLoved it.",Mimi

1937,doncash-10224,Full of lies and unethical foundations,2,30 July 2021,"Mimi, a 25 years old beauty, was from a conservative family who only dreamed to become a film star at Bollywood. She didn't find any other ways except becoming a surrogate mum for money to become a film star! Is it so important? It brings wrong message to the society. She kept telling lies just for her dream. She became ferocious for money when she heard that the American had left. Those Americans didn't even bother to do the second test and they immediately left leaving Mimi alone for all pains in an Indian culture.

1976,nikitakanaya,I wish the ending was REALISTIC.,5,4 August 2021,"Thanks to Mimi, more ignorant people are becoming aware of surrogacy and infertility. Great casting, specifically with the protagonist (Mimi) and her friend, Shama. (Sad that Supriya Pathak's talent was wasted.)The first half of the movie was quite enjoyable, then they just had to go and ruin it right?*Spoiler alert*
IF THE BABY HAS ""PROBLEMS"" like Down's Syndrome, then why not go ahead with delivering a baby with Down's? WHY DOES IT SEEM LIKE A MIRACLE THAT THE BABY WAS NORMAL? Why could the team not be more realistic and depict the actuality of producing a baby with down's? Oh because the grandparents would not be so attached? Oh because the mother would hate the baby or continue to curse herself? Oh because the American couple would not return to collect their child? Such a stupid motive, just to achieve the ""dhamaka"" effect of Bollywood. It was enraging to say the least.",Mimi

1978,prernathakurcgi,Amazing performance but has a few very problematic issues that were glorified,2,5 August 2021,"No doubt this movie is the best performance of Kriti Sanon's career. She has done a brilliant job.Panjak Tripathi as usual did an amazing job.Songs are really soulful.However there are a few issues with it-1. Glorification of colorism- There were quite a few instances where colorism was glorified like people asking tips to have a very fair child, the white color of child being the highlight in the whole district, the whole life of kriti sanon and its decisions being in the hands of the white women.2. The dialogue where she says ""if killing a living child is a crime, killing a child inside womb too is"" - By saying this, she is not only triggering a guilt in women who had to choose to abort their child, but also puts all the efforts that we as a society are putting towards legalising abortion, to nothing. Also, as a disrespect to her fellow surrogates who had no choice but to choose that path. The movie would still had been perfect without his one dialogue, but the makers chose to be insensitive towards such a sensitive subject.3. It glorified the fact that a women had to completely forget about her dreams coz she had a baby. There is a specific dialogue by Pankaj Tripathi to highlight this.If not for these points, the movie would have been a really good one.",Mimi

Her portrayal of an aspiring actress who agrees to be a surrogate mother just for the sake of money is in far contrast to her portrayal as a mother. The wide gamut of emotions expressed by Kriti is breathtaking. She is well supported by fine actors like Pankaj Tripathi and Sai Tamhankar to make this movie a must watch for anyone.",Mimi

I think this one competes head on with horror comedy Ruhi this year 2021.Looks like its a wonderful time for selfmade talent in Bollywood... Kriti Sanon, Tapsee Pannu, Kangana Ranaut, Bhumi Padnekar...Its Kriti's time to shine and boy did she nail the character! Kudos to the Director for bringing out the best in every actor and for a witty narration of a touching story.Pankaj Tripathi, Supriya Pathak, Manoj Pahwa, Sai Tamhankar: They all breathe life and give Kriti a solid platform to excel in this movie. Kriti carries the plot so effortlessly with perfect comic timing, and then transforms into a perfect caring Mother. You'll feel sad for her, when she's helpless and how she turns the plot. Kriti hits the ball out the stadium, many times in this movie and establishes herself as an Actor that you just cannot ignore.Mr Pankaj Tripathi you are so natural, guess you get tired of compliments. We love everything that you do on TV/Movies... hola me when you visit USA.Music!After couple of songs is when I realized it was AR Rahman who might've composed the music. Well what can I say... Genius that he is, but if you are familiar with his discography, there's some deja-vu for you... nothing wrong in getting inspired with your own tunes, right?1) Hututu: brilliant song.... try to find the traces of ""Tu Bin Bataye"" from Rang de basanti...
2) Phuljhadiyon: Yet another hit song! (did anyone catch the flavor of Wat Wat Wat from tamasha in this one?)
3) Rihayi De( and then listen to to On Sona Tere liye from MOM) :-)
4) Param Sundari: ARR tries his luck with masala - item song, Shreya Goshal is my generations' Lata Mangeshkar
5) Yaane Yaane: OK Song
6) Rock A Bye Baby: When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall :-)... well I like this song very much, just listen to the guitar at play... ARR's best lullaby to date is ""Pyara sa gaon"" from Zubeida...What I like about ARR is how he garnishes his songs with exotic instruments, like little jingles; subtle yet leaves a crunch, Genius! His music enhances the richness of this movie!I hope to meet this crew someday.",Mimi

This has to be the best movie of 2021. It is without a doubt the performance of Kriti Sanon and off course Pankaj ji, and the whole team just nailed it..I created this account just to review the movie that is really worth watching.

I enjoyed how motherhood was portrayed through the main protagonist, Mimi ... how she embraces it naturally and prioritizes her son over everything else .. It is definitely a huge high in acting prowess on the part of Kriti Sanon playing Mimi.. I feel she owned the movie and did complete justice to the role .. However, tremendously talented and seasoned actors like Pankaj Tripathi, Ratna Shah Pathak were not utilised fully - I feel their roles could have been meatier. Nevertheless, the plot is predictable with twist and turns but definitely worth a watch! Also, the social message at the end of movie is very encouraging and definitely something we should think and act on!",Mimi

2042,gdaurore,Ending too forgiving? I'm still cursing the couple,8,1 August 2021,"Just watched it and I honestly just couldn't bear the Americans, their character as well as their acting (but that might be due to the plot, dunno)... The end made me more angry than relaxed... *Spoiler alert*
To me, the movie kind of showed the couple ""in a good light"", almost justifying their immoral acts..Especially in the end, where they showed everyone so relieved, happy and forgiving because they ALL OF A SUDDEN decided to adopt MAY GOD BLESS THEM instead of insisting to get the child... Like come on!I can't understand how it can end on such a good note after all the drama they created, and their attitude with Mimi saying she won't be able to assure the kid a good future, pressuring to go to the court and using all means to get what they want. Their bad character is just not pointed out enough or even just questioned!Allow me to remind you they wanted a young girl with big dreams to abort ""their so called dear child"" WITHOUT EVEN FACING HER BEFORE LEAVING and on top of that, for the only reason that he MAY BE or was DISABLEDSERIOUSLY. It's just so wrong to me that the end was just ""oh koi baat nahin, see they are adopting now, we should even thank them, everyone's having a happy ending, that's great hahaha""Let's of course not mention the fact that you can not just decide to suddenly adopt... And come on. They should have done that in the first place (my opinion of course) but these people get offended when Bhanu dares saying ""maal"", but they, themselves, just throw a surrogate mother and ""their own child"" growing in her body to the trash mid-pregnancy without facing any consequence. Also isn't it supposed to be discussed right before doing it ? We never saw the doctor explaining that (and other risks) to Mimi, but they showed her not being shocked hearing the couple ran away... Like aren't there any rules ? If not, why not showing it ? I read some comment saying it was too light and I totally agree. I loved the comedy aspect but in some scenes it really should have been more intense...Anyway that's a plot thing, but to me the director really failed at showing the real difficulties faced in this case and especially the immorality of those rich people who just think they can do anything with their money (like you tried to say abortion is wrong, but taking benefits of poor women and throwing them like they're trash if they don't deliver your ""merch"" in good condition is totally fine?)Anyway. I still enjoyed the movie thanks to the amazing Indian cast and AR Rahman soothing music.",Mimi
2043,shubhamkarpe,Simply Beautiful!!,10,29 July 2021,Where do I start.. Kriti is so amazing.. you laugh with her.. you cry with her.. absolute beauty and the way this movie has dealt with motherhood and sensitive topics of surrogacy along with family acceptance and AR Rehman.. Oh my god.. Heaven for the ears.. Pankaj marvellous as he is.. and Sai Tamhankar does her part too.. One of the finest movies Ive seen in 2021... Really sad about the movie leaking online if possible see it legit.. Coz this ones hell a ride and hits the right cords.. Kudos!,Mimi
2044,supradipbhakta,Challenging roles play,9,5 September 2021,This movie is educative in respect of the Surrogacy systems running in our country.. Here a small town girl dreamt of a future that need lots of money to start. Opportunity comes to her from a US couple who are looking for a perfect surrogate mother. And story takes turn when things not happens how it should be.But there is a huge scope for the director of the movie for focusing the main story of surrogacy system in India in stead of showcasing it as surrogacy is still just another avenue for our movies to romanticise motherhood.,Mimi

2047,miraliqbal,The anti-abortion dialogues were totally unnecessary.,6,4 August 2021,"The scene where Kriti said ""Bacha to pait mai bhe zinda hota hai na"" really made me uncomfortable.

Apart from that, The movie was greatly executed and refreshingly original.",Mimi

2067,savijiths,Musical entertainment,10,27 July 2021,"Watched *Mimi*
A simple, beautiful, soulful and heart touching movie.Loved every bit of it. The director Laxman Utekar, needs a huge credit to put all of this together.It's not easy to not get overwhelmed by AR's music, and not let it affect the narrative.And he has attained that, the music beautifully blended with the movie, and took the narrative to another level.The climax scene, the one where Mimi gives birth and holds the baby for the first time, were accenuated by Rahman Sir's music.A complete movie, with a mix of clean unforced comedy, and simple and believable emotions.A perfect balance was stuck in all ground.Kriti Sanon also has lived the role of Mimi. There was a lot of publicity for her 15kg or so weight gain and all. But her performance was much much beyond that.A superlative performance, very effectivey supported by Pankaj Tripathi, Sai Tamhankar, Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak.This movie certainly needs another watch :)

Kriti has acted brilliantly. I could feel her pain and happiness. It is difficult to make the audience feel. A part of that is also good direction. The support staff was strong.After reading about theovie I found that it is a 'loose remake' of a 2010 Marathi movie 'Mala aai vhaaychay'.
