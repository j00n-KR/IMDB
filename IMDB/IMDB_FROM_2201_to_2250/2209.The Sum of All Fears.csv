0,Leofwine_draca,A snappy and surprising thriller,7,2 January 2017,"Here's a fresh interpretation of a popular Tom Clancy novel, which mixes CIA jargon with presidential anguish into a pleasing, pulse-pounding brew. The impact of the 9/11 disaster is readily apparent in this suspenseful movie which is part disaster-film itself. The old trick of US vs. Russia (but not really) is familiar territory, but through crisp writing and engaging characters the story is given time to develop, strengthening the clichés and making everything very watchable. A strong budget leads to some very effective effects sequences, and cinematography and score are both excellent. The cast is also populated with some strong character actors – Liev Schrieber has never been better than here, as a spy; Morgan Freeman does his 'wise old mentor' role with skill, wit and relish; James Cromwell makes for a very human and believable president; even the usually bland Ben Affleck comes out good, having followed in Harrison Ford's shoes as the heroic Jack Ryan.The opening of the film sets the style well and leads us into some very dark areas. One of the major incidents in the film involves a nuclear weapon exploding in a packed US city, which makes for pretty frightening viewing. Realism seems to be 100% through and through and there are no annoying plot holes or discrepancies. The last half of the film racks up the suspense levels with tons of action and adventure, making this a film to be watched and a darned sight better than most modern fare.",The Sum of All Fears
1,SnoopyStyle,Too much CSPAN homework,6,3 May 2014,"In the 1973 Arab–Israeli War, Israel launches a plane with a nuke but then is shot down over the Golans. In modern times, the nuclear bomb is found by arab scrappers and falls into the hands of arms trader Olson (Colm Feore). Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) works behind a desk as a CIA analyst. He's brought in to advise on the new Russian President Nemerov (Ciarán Hinds). Everybody thinks Nemerov is a hardliner except Ryan. His girlfriend Dr. Cathy Muller (Bridget Moynahan) doesn't know about his work. DCI William Cabot (Morgan Freeman) brings Ryan to Russia to inspect disarming efforts and uncovers that 3 Russian scientists are missing. John Clark (Liev Schreiber) is sent to find the scientists. During the White House correspondence dinner, President Fowler (James Cromwell) and everybody is called in about a Russian chemical attack in Chechnya. Nemerov pretends that it's his operation instead of renegade generals. Clark discovers the 3 Russian scientists working on the nuke under Olson. A worldwide cabal of right wing nationalist parties smuggles the Israeli nuke into Washington and sets it off in a plan to ignite a war between the nuclear superpowers.This Jack Ryan movie takes forever to get going. There is too much explaining and political intrigue. It's a little too much CSPAN. It's not good enough to be a spy movie and Jack Ryan has always been more action than cerebral. The franchise is action thriller with a brain. This feels like a Bond movie without the action sequences. And then a nuke goes off to make up for it. At least it's an exciting turn that injects some much needed energy. The other problem for this movie is the timing.Sometimes world events overtake the movie world. This one suffers from coming out so soon after 9/11. The political intrigue would be passable in years past seems so cartoonish now. It tries so hard to be realistic but it just rings hallow. It's not gritty realistic enough, and neither is it cartoonish enough to be escapist fun. It's the worst of both worlds.There are great actors at work here starting with Morgan Freeman. Ben Affleck is a good young Ryan even though it's a failed reboot. I can understand the criticism at the time. After the ridiculous 'Pearl Habor', he didn't have enough credibility. It's the start of his years of terrible roles and bad acting.",The Sum of All Fears
2,kosmasp,War - what is it good for?,8,20 September 2021,"What is one of the worst things or even the worst that can happen? Nuclear war ... and at the time this is playing, the big players going at each others throats would be USA and Russia. Now the movie will not make a big secret of what is happening to the viewer, but it will be tough to see for the goverments themselves ... which leads us to the question I asked and also the answer - which obviously I won't reveal, because of spoilers and all that.The acting is really good and the suspense is as high as it gets. You may know or think you know how this all will end, but that does not take away anything of the journey you are about to embark. Really good stuff and really well played from everyone involved. Some cliches are even taken head on and the movie spins them a little bit ... just a little bit, but still refreshing.Haven't read any of the novels by the way, so I can not compare this to the source material. Which may be a good thing I reckon ... but I thought I'd mention it, just in case you were wondering how it fares.",The Sum of All Fears
3,classicsoncall,"""...we are now in a de facto state of war with the Russians.""",7,17 July 2021,"This is a taut espionage/political thriller while watching, but some of the scenarios require a suspension of disbelief upon considering real world implications. Although a nuclear weapon can be set off at ground level, it's generally triggered in the air above it's intended target at a precise altitude. That's one, with the aftermath of the blast causing radiation poisoning for miles around the surrounding area, something which wasn't even brought up as a concern, except for a mention of the wind in a northern and westerly direction from the explosion site. You're pretty much not expected to think about things like that while watching, but I just can't help it myself.The global political machinations involving Russia's intervention into Chechnya prefaced by a little more than a decade the unrest in the Ukraine when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, so that was somewhat prophetic. From a present day standpoint it's easy enough to point that out, but I don't know if anyone was thinking about that back in 2002 when this film was released. At that time, everyone was still focused on 9/11.Considering it's a Jack Ryan story, with the hero portrayed by Ben Affleck, you have to allow for some latitude in the amount of freedom allowed the character to access the levels of command he was able to given his civilian position. Especially after his mentor William Cabot (Morgan Freeman) died, but I guess that's why it's called a thriller. With all due respect to novelist Tom Clancy, who wrote the book upon which this film is based, the idea of a rogue outsider attempting to foment war between opposing powers in order to step into the breach after they destroy each other, is not itself entirely new. A similar plot element was used back in 1977 for the James Bond film, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". Same idea, but with British and Russian nuclear subs about to fire upon Moscow and New York City until Bond makes the save.",The Sum of All Fears
4,gavin6942,I Think My Faith in Ben Affleck Might Finally Be Shattered,7,6 August 2006,"I have heard the director of this film did not want his work compared to the work of prior directors working on Jack Ryan films. He also did not want people comparing Ben Affleck to Harrison Ford or Alec Baldwin, because this was to be a whole new incarnation. I am willing to do that, especially since I am unfamiliar with the other Jack Ryan films. But either way, one thing is clear: Ben Affleck can't act his way out of a paper bag.The movie overall was very nice. The content was timely and interesting, and I believe that the situations presented in the film are very plausible. Certain liberties were taken with how a nuclear explosion works, I think, but I'm no expert in that department so I'll just ignore what I find to be a glaringly outrageous premise.But yeah, Affleck really didn't come through for me. Every so often his character would say the same things over and over again (""I know this guy!"") and did not come across as someone the audience should be cheering for. I was on the side of the government, thinking he was a pretentious brat who should shut up and go home. If that was the film's intention I'm even more confused -- that would leave me hating both the government and the main character. How am I supposed to feel good about that? But yes, the plot was interesting and held me very tightly through the film. I'm tempted to make a connection to ""Broken Arrow"" (another film about a stray nuclear warhead), but I think I've already tainted this film enough.",The Sum of All Fears
5,ccthemovieman-1,A Disgrace To Clancy's Book & An Insult To All Of Us,2,28 May 2007,"This film was a far cry from the book by Tom Clancy, who wrote about Al Queda terrorists reading a set off a nuclear bomb in America. The latter must have been sick watching this movie and typically-Left Wing Hollywood changed the script to being one with Nazis as the villains instead.Are you kidding me? How ridiculously politically correct is that? If I had known this beforehand, I would have boycotted this insulting movie, instead of wasting money on it.Also, at least to me, Harrison Ford will always be ""Jack Ryan,"" not some second-rate pretty- boy actor like Ben Affleck. The only redeeming qualities to this film were the nice cinematography and the awesome sound when the big bomb went off. If you have a surround sound, that scene will rock your room. Too bad, they didn't blow up this film before it was released.",The Sum of All Fears
6,rmax304823,The evolution of enmity,6,26 March 2005,"It's easy to make somebody look villainous. You give him a grim dark face, something along the lines of Bela Lugosi, deprive him of any sense of humor, have him speak with an accent, and light his face from below with a hideous green key light. While you're at it, make him a full foot shorter than his American counterpart, played here by John Cromwell who -- and this is a little-known fact -- is the third tallest human being on the planet. All these conventions are adhered to in this movie. The Russian Premier thinks as reasonably as the American president, but it's hard to believe his lines when they come from a mouth with lips that resemble a fresh two-inch incision on somebody's belly.The real problem isn't making someone look like the enemy. It's deciding who should be the enemy in the first place. The Soviets provided us with bad examples for decades but -- well, they are, let's say, no longer available to Hollywood. As the Cold War wound down, even Ian Fleming had trouble. The real SMERSH had to be changed to the fictional SPECTRE because Fleming's conscious was beginning to trouble him.In ""The Sum of All Fears,"" the Nazis are resurrected, a kind of generic villain to whom no one will object. How could things possibly go wrong? Is someone going to write an angry letter to the New York Times and say, ""Hey -- wait a minute! My grandparents were Nazis and I'm offended""? The movie calls them ""terrorists"" and throws in, let me think, Aryan supremacists, and some others into the stew, but they speak German and we all know who they are.The plot? This group of terrorists decides (for reasons I seem to have forgotten) to blow up a nuclear bomb in America, an act which they figure will provoke a response against Russia, who will then respond because they must show their strength, and so forth, until there is a nuclear exchange and the world is basically blown apart. Jack Ryan, or ""Doctor Ryan"" as everyone calls him, figures out the plot and barely prevents the plan's success.I enjoyed watching the movie. Great shots of airplanes. Special effects, some of them a bit obvious, involving the exploding bomb in Baltimore during the Superbowl. (Does Baltimore have a pro football team? The Crab Cakes or the McHenrys or something?) There's a big hole in the middle of the movie though. Ben Affleck has a big chin and looks the part. I'm sure he's a good guy but he is lightweight for the part. Both Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford were able to bring strength and some underlying humor to the same role whereas Affleck hits his marks and speaks. I hated to see Morgan Freeman die half-way through. And John Cromwell is a splendid actor but the part doesn't allow him to do much with his character.The climax is borrowed from ""The Godfather."" Nessun Dorma -- the aria de jour -- swells in the background while we see the president and the premier signing some sort of joint anti-war treaty, and this triumphant scene alternates with bloody assassinations.Tom Clancy is an interesting guy. I've only read ""The Hunt for Red October"" and I can understand why it was all the rage at the military academies. It was really retro. But it was also filled with exciting bits of technology -- how nuclear powered subs work and all that. He evidently used to spend a lot of time shooting at targets with a large caliber pistol. And I saw him perform for his charity, along with three other celebrities, on ""Jeopardy."" The other contestants bungled their buttons and stumbled over their answers and joked about their own inadequacies. Clancy didn't do that. He smiled politely throughout, was thoroughly decorous, and answered every question flawlessly and without iterative comment. He demolished the competition. In interviews he's been candid and friendly. I'd like to have a beer with the guy sometime.",The Sum of All Fears
7,ma-cortes,"Exciting and thrilling installment in which a young analyst , Jack Ryan, must supply advise to US President , then goes into action",7,31 August 2014,"Jack Ryan's entry with lots of noisy action , thrills , chills , tension and amazing thriller . This blockbuster is an acceptable adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to other prior renditions . The title is paraphrased from a Winston Churchill speech; ""Why, you can take the most gallant sailor, the most intrepid airman or the most audacious soldier, put them at a table together - what do you get? The sum of their fears."" It deals with CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) along with a ranking member (Morgan Freeman) of Presidential administration must thwart the plans of a terrorist faction that threatens to induce a catastrophic conflict between the United States and Russia's newly elected president by detonating a nuclear weapon at a football game in Baltimore. As there are 27,000 Nuclear Weapons and One Is Missing . Now Ryan goes back in action for the most vital assignment of his life : to save the President (James Cromwell) and the nation .Stirring outing filled with emotion , suspense , chills , twisted intrigue and extraordinary nail-biting action scenes . This film is a prequel to the others in the Jack Ryan series . The 'Harrison Ford' films are direct follow-ups to The hunt for Red October (1990) despite the recast of Alec Baldwin's role . Nevertheless, in this film we see Jack Ryan meet John Clark, something which also happens in Clear and present danger (1994) . Therefore this film might be best understood as a reboot of the Jack Ryan series . Interesting screenplay plenty of twists and thrills by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne . However , the filmmaker changed the villains from Islamic extremists , in the novel , to Neo-Nazis ; this was done because prior to the 11 September 2001 attacks, he did not believe Arab terrorists could plausibly accomplish all that was necessary for the plot to work on film . Good production design , in fact , the CIA scenes were filmed at the actual CIA headquarters ; this was one of the times the CIA had ever done such a thing . And this was the first American film unit to enter the Kremlin , though Red Heat (1988) was the first American unit to film in Moscow . The spectacular ""Super Bowl"" scene takes place in Baltimore , the two teams playing in the game are portrayed by the Toronto Argonauts and the Montreal Alouettes . Real U. S. Marines along with two Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters were used for the sequence of rescuing Fowler from the wrecked motorcade . The picture has a very good support cast who gives excellent performances such as James Cromwell as President Fowler , Bruce McGill as National Security Adviser , John Beasley as General Lasseter , Philip Baker Hall as Defense Secretary , Joseph Sommer as Senator , Michael Byrne , Liev Schreiber , Alan Bates , Sven-Ole Thorsen , Ron Rifkin , Colm Feore and special mention to Ciaran Hinds as Russia President . Spectacular musical score fitting to action and suspense by maestro veteran Jerry Goldsmith . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by John Lindley . The picture is well directed by Phil Alden Robinson , though Philip Noyce, director of previous entries, was offered to direct but turned it down and Wolfgang Petersen was also offered the chance to direct but declined.This blockbuster is an entertaining adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to ¨The hunt for Red October¨ by John MacTiernan with Alec Balwin and Sean Connery , followed by ¨Patriot games¨ (1992) by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford taking over the role of Ryan from Alec Baldwin and again ¨Clear and present danger¨(1994) by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford and Anne Archer . Then Harrison Ford dropped out of reprising the role of Jack Ryan because he and director Phillip Noyce could not agree on the script and Noyce ended up dropping out of the film as well. And finally , Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014) by Kenneth Brannagh with Chris Pine as Jack Ryan , Keira Knightley and Kevin Costner .",The Sum of All Fears
8,blanche-2,"Exciting, just don't think about it too much",7,3 October 2009,"Ben Affleck has a go at playing Jack Ryan, the Tom Clancy hero, in ""The Sum of All Fears,"" a 2003 film also starring Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Liev Schreiber, Alan Bates, and Bridget Moynihan. I'll admit I'm not familiar with the books, but it does seem that either the screenwriter or Clancy made this an earlier story - by Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, Jack, Harrison Ford in those films, is married to Cathy; here, they're just dating. Also, Affleck is younger than Ford. That's odd, because this film seems to be cashing in on 9/11, so it should really be after the other films...so I'm confused.That's what I mean about this movie - I enjoyed it, but it's one of those things that, if you think about it, makes very little sense. Here, some sort of Nazi splinter group has purchased an old bomb and is making the Russians think that the U.S. has attacked them and vice versa. Amidst the chaos of a huge atomic explosion that wipes out a stadium, it's up to Jack to reach someone in power before they push the red button and each country wipes out the other, leaving the world free for - who, Germany? - to take over. Not that there will be much left.There's a lot of action, and the movie goes fast enough so that you don't notice the holes right away.Affleck is likable, but you'll have a hard time lining him up with the Jack Ryan of Ford. Alec Baldwin has also played Jack; that's maybe a closer comparison. James Cromwell is terrific as a no-nonsense President; Morgan Freeman underplays and is very good.People that have read the book hate this movie, so if you've read the book, I wouldn't bother seeing this.",The Sum of All Fears
9,Quinoa1984,Packs a good punch,6,8 June 2002,"Tom Clancy's The Sum of All Fears is a fascinating and exciting examination of the worst of situations.  When looking last year at Pearl Harbor and seeing Ben Affleck's talent squandered so horribly in a action picture it's good to see him in a movie of this magnitude, that echoes of post 9/11 fright and paranoia of the end of order with other countries. 
Here, he plays Jack Ryan, a young Ryan (despite the mis-order of chronology that Ford and Baldwin were both older than Affleck is now when they played Ryan years before this took place which is one of the films odd flaws), who is entering the CIA via Cabot (Morgan Freeman, funny and interesting here) and investigating three missing Russian scientists.  Then what unravels is something I shouldn't reveal here only to say that it involves the city of Baltimore- and the events that follow bring the film to tight suspense involving the President and his cabinet and Ryan trying to contact the President, and so on.  Some parts drag, and the very ending is way, way too Hollywood for the rest of the picture, but fans of Clancy, and the actors, will be delighted. A-",The Sum of All Fears

12,michaelRokeefe,Tense. Taut. Powerful. Thriller to the end.,9,1 June 2002,"This movie has been nit-picked to death. Forget about the lack of continuity and the variance from Tom Clancy's novel. A war monger(Alan Bates)buys a nuclear bomb on the black market to avenge his father's death.

F/X are super. The story line wiggles around a little, but the viewer is anxious and loving every minute of it. This is a thriller to the end. Everything you would want in a movie. A major problem, grand explosions, destruction, a hero and you get to see that the bad guys get taken care of. I am not an Affleck fan, but he does a very good job with what he was given to work with. For me, Freeman was the pivotal character and when he got killed...the movie too started to die.

13,sunwarrior13,Meet The Young Jack Ryan,9,29 June 2014,"The Sum Of All Fears is an action/political thriller that features Jack Ryan,the famous CIA spy developed by Tom Clancy.This is the fourth film about the character that was based on Clancy's novel with the same title after the likes of The Hunt For Red October,Patriot Games and Clear And Present Danger were made into films. In it,it features a younger Jack Ryan portrayed by Ben Affleck.The cast also includes Morgan Freeman and Bridget Moynahan. Phil Alden Robinson directed it.The President of Russia passed away and he is succeeded by an unknown whom little information is known.This causes panic to many nations especially the United States.To pacify the fears felt by many,the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director Bill Cabot recruits Jack Ryan,a young analyst working from the Russia desk to gather information and provide insight.But many events happen such as the capital of Chechnya is leveled by a nuclear bomb.Then fear intensifies especially when terrorist threats are being made to the U.S.It is now up to Jack Ryan to prevent these threats or another world war could happen anytime soon.This new Jack Ryan film is somewhat unrealistic and lacks plausibility particularly with the events that could happen particularly in the international front and the political motivations behind the countries involved in conflict.The bomb being set at a Superbowl was somewhat cheesy although it did manage to provide suspense to the story.Added to that,we get to see the new character more of a heartthrob rather than an intelligence expert.While many female fans may not disapprove of that especially with Affleck playing the lead role,it is distracting and it somewhat takes away many substances that Tom Clancy's novels want to provide his intended audience.It made a lot of money more than ten years ago.Although it was far from a typical Clancy novel and what intelligence spies are all about,it will definitely provide entertainment and great musical soundtrack.While this may displease many critics and the serious moviegoer,an average fan may not find displeasure in it for it was definitely a fun movie for them especially if they like Mission Impossible and James Bond films.",The Sum of All Fears
14,hitchcockthelegend,"Let's see. Who else has 27,000 nukes for us to worry about?",8,22 September 2012,"The Sum of All Fears is directed by Phil Alden Robinson and adapted to screenplay by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne from the novel of the same name written by Tom Clancy. It stars Ben Affleck, Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Ciaran Hinds, Liev Schreiber, Bridget Moynahan and Michael Byrne. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by John Lindley.Film is the fourth film to feature the character Jack Ryan (Affleck). It is set in present day 2002 but with Ryan younger than in the other films and at the start of his career in the CIA. Plot is Cold War themed and finds America in a sweat when it is found that renegade terrorists have a nuclear weapon in their possession; just as a new supposed radical president takes up office in Russia.Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet, we all breathe the same air, we all cherish our children's futures, and we are all mortal.2002 saw two great thrillers released that starred Ben Affleck, one was Changing Lanes, the other was this Jack Ryan based effort that attempted to reboot the series. Coming a year after the September 11 attacks and featuring a plot involving terrorists using a bomb that America supplied the Israelis in the 70s during the Yom Kippur War, it was material too close to the bone for some critics. Yet the film did well at the box office in the States and including Worldwide takings it garnered well over $100 million in profit. Impressive figures considering it's not an action blockbuster, it relies on brain over brawn and leading man Affleck was on the back of Pearl Harbor and bearing the brunt of critical scorn.Each day we lose a little bit more of our separate, sovereign ability to determine our own futures... and each day the world comes a little bit closer to that terrible moment when the beating of a butterfly's wings unleashes a hurricane God himself cannot stop.Comforted by the superb cast around him, which also includes the likes of Colm Feore, Phillip Baker Hall and Alan Bates in support slots, Affleck proves perfect for the material to hand. Without doubt he's no Harrison Ford, in the same way Moynahan is no Anne Archer, tough boots to fill in the roles of Jack and Cathy Ryan respectively, but in a re-jig of Ryan the character, we now have the arrogance of youth dressed up in slacks and t-shirt, a smart brained youngster beginning his CIA career at a perilous time, a time that thankfully is devoid of jingoistic flag waving, but of adult political sensibilities. Affleck's Ryan as a character is as refreshing as the writers' responsible attitude is.You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki. Do not lecture me on Chechnya!With shades of the Cuban Missile Crisis and a Fail-Safe like finale, The Sum of All Fears rounds out as a nail biter of a thriller. Dig deeper and some implausibilities surface, but we are asked to tune into the paranoia and get in deep with the characters trying to avert global catastrophe, to decry the film's cerebral thriller qualities is churlish. The Jack Ryan parts of the film involving Cathy the girlfriend are the least interesting, but here's the thing, young Jack Ryan is just one of the components making up a far bigger whole. The film isn't solely a Jack Ryan movie. The source novel was a door stopper, so inevitably much as been excised from it, and inevitably fans of the book have been vocal in their displeasure; though we would have needed another hour of film to even get close to Clancy's big block of fiction. So in place is a picture that is uncomplicated in structure and story telling and comes in at under two hours running time. It's credit to director Robinson that The Sum of All Fears engrosses from start to finish.It was hoped that the reboot would herald the start of a run of more Jack Ryan based movies, but in spite of the great box office, this didn't materialise. But that is in no way any marker to the quality of the film, or its standing in the Jack Ryan series. Judge it on its own merits and ideas and the rewards are many, especially on a second viewing. At the time of writing Jack Ryan will return to the big screen in December 2013, titled simply as Jack Ryan, with another young actor, Chris Pine in the role of Ryan. Undoubtedly that will be high on action, such is the way of drawing in the young dollars at the multiplexes these days. But if it has half the tension and brains of Robinson's picture then we will be blessed. If not? Then there's an even bigger reason to treasure Jack Ryan's 2002 version. 7.5/10",The Sum of All Fears
15,jotix100,Fear of WMD,7,27 April 2004,"Having read the Tom Clancy book beforehand, and having heard some comments about this film, kept me away from seeing it when it was first released. Now I know why: my fears about what I thought would come out on the screen were proven correct. It is a messy film, to say the least.First of all, in reading the credits for the film, I realize that Tom Clancy, himself, was involved in the project. How could he have agreed to change the plot?, it is beyond imagination. The whole point of it the novel is done away with in the screen treatment it received.Who knows why Ben Affleck got the role of Ryan. In past installments, this character has been played by Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford. Mr. Affleck pales in comparison with those two, in stature, as well as in screen presence. On top of that, having him acting next to Liev Schreiber, who is an actor's actor, only exacerbates the contrast. The film, directed by Phil Alden Robinson, is a puzzle at times because the tone of it just doesn't make much sense. An international cast with different accents and different acting techniques doesn't improve in the over all result. Thankfully I saw it in DVD format that was borrowed from a friend!",The Sum of All Fears
16,Hey_Sweden,"Not bad, but you know what to expect.",6,11 July 2020,"The enduring character of Jack Ryan, the CIA analyst created by author Tom Clancy, is once again out to prove himself correct on a critically important issue. The scenario has a thoroughly evil, Neo-Nazi fascist played by the great English actor Alan Bates plot to have two major world powers, America and Russia, completely destroy each other. This he will do by smuggling a nuclear bomb into the States and detonating it at a championship football game. Ryan knows the new Russian president, Nemerov (played by Irish actor Ciaran Hinds), is not a hard-liner, and was not responsible for the bombing, so he has to somehow convince all his superiors that this third party is the guilty one.Don't go into this one looking for credibility, despite its attempts to draw on real life and be topical. ""The Sum of All Fears"" is not for viewers who can't tolerate plot holes. Also, what takes some of the impact away is that in the Clancy novel, the villains were Middle Eastern terrorists, and the screenwriters and filmmakers caved in to political correctness by making Bates and his cohorts Nazis (because, of course, Nazis are still almost universally despised individuals). Ryan is here pictured in his early years with the Agency, and as portrayed by Ben Affleck, is closer to the incarnation created by Alec Baldwin in ""The Hunt for Red October"": an office drone with no real field experience. Yet, as the film turns more and more conventional, the character once again becomes something of a superhero, with a beat-the-clock premise staring him in the face.Even with its flaws, the film is still pretty slick and does push audience buttons with some intensity. (The second half, after the bomb has been detonated, has some of the better sequences.) It manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of a truly excellent supporting cast: Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Ken Jenkins, Bruce McGill, John Beasley, Philip Baker Hall, Josef Sommer, Colm Feore, Michael Byrne, Ron Rifkin, etc. Liev Schrieber is amusing playing a younger, greener version of the operative played by Willem Dafoe in the film adaptation of ""Clear and Present Danger"". Affleck, as usual, is nothing special, bringing nothing particularly interesting to the role of Ryan.Fans of Clancy and the novel may want to steer clear of this picture.

Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) knows, but can he convince both the governments?There's more to it but, basically, that's the plot.  As it is, it's pretty good.  It may be a little disturbing, however, to some people after 9/11. If this had been released before then it would have been seen as just another Cold War movie.  It's very well-done but no great shakes...the attack scenes are frightening to watch.Affleck is very good as Ryan.  He's young, good-looking, intelligent and Affleck's low-key acting fits the Ryan role like a glove.  Morgan Freeman shows up (again) as a mentor to Ryan.  Nothing against Freeman, but hasn't he played this role once too often?  Also John Cromwell is excellent as the president (completely covering his British accent).So, an enjoyable drama...unless 9/11 really hit you close to home.  If it did, avoid this.",The Sum of All Fears

19,Boba_Fett1138,Didn't liked it at first...,8,17 May 2003,"...maybe it was because I was expecting another Harrison Ford like Jack Ryan movie. But then I saw the movie again...The story is disturbing realistic which is a very big plus. There's nothing in the movie that couldn't really happen today or tomorrow.I admit that Ben Affleck wouldn't have been my first choice as young Dr. Ryan (not even my second of third) however I must also admit that he actually does a nice job, something I didn't expected. The other actors are also fine, especially James Cromwell (President Fowler) and Ciarán Hinds (President Nemerov)Visually the movie looks great. There's a nice atmosphere throughout the whole movie and some outstanding special effects. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a surprising good soundtrack (especially the beginning is superb!)The first halve of the movie is only average and nothing special with some weak action and a almost predictable story. The second halve however makes up a lot. The second halve of the movie can be described as ""Dr. Strangelove like"" where the 2 biggest world leaders have the faith of the world in their hands. Another big plus is that it shows the story from both the American and Russian side with Jack Ryan in the middle trying to prevent a nuclear war between the both countries. Like I said before it's extremely realistic, a good example of this is the scene in Air Force One right after the nuclear explosion, all the people on board are in panic and talking at the same time just like it would happen in real life.At first my opinion was that the movie lacked a villain, all the villains in the movie are minor characters and everything they do seems to be happening in the background of the movie. Then I realized that the events in the movie are already shocking and disturbing enough and that there aren't any villains needed at all.The movie is recommendable for everybody that want to see a realistic movie with a good quick pace and some nice special effects and dialog.At first I would have rated it 6/10 however I now rate it a:8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Sum of All Fears
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Math does scare a lot of people,7,12 September 2008,"I have not read the novel(I understand that this follows the/his style well, however), and all I know about the series is what I gathered from the three prior films. I suppose a good place to start is admitting that neither I, nor my fiancée whom I watched it with, particularly care for or understand the casting of Ben in action(not that there's necessarily an awful lot of such in this) movies. We don't see how he fits that(and his lack of screen presence and charisma shows). Beyond that, this is actually quite fine, if it should maybe not have been connected to the franchise(restarting it as it were, and do note that they are now, evidently, little more than half a decade after this, rebooting it yet again). Baldwin made a determined, if reluctant hero of Jack, Ford took that over well(obviously, since that sums up most of his career), and this time, Affleck... kind of turns him into a whiny pretty boy(although the writing of the role doesn't deviate that strongly from that of the others... it lies in his performance). Not to mention that Dafoe's Clark'd kick the ass of Schreiber's, which is not to say that the latter does poorly. The characters, in general, aren't bad. The casting is spot-on, save for the two aforementioned exceptions. The acting, as well. This has positive aspects to it, and even if you like the other entries, you could still enjoy this, as my wife-to-be suggested, merely think of those parts, Ryan and John, as not being the same, previously(and better) established ones. The story has well-done elements(possibly rehashed from earlier incarnations of the universe, but not all, and not the fundamental concept), and has realized potential(not the full extent of it, though). It is particularly sound until it all derails near the conclusion, succumbing to the agenda being pushed(no matter the implausibilities that occur along the way... and creative license is taken with the technology to move this along smoothly). The president's advisors in this aren't terribly well defined, in specific government jobs... they are basically just a cacophony of voices telling him what to or not to do. The pacing is reasonable, never losing the audience. Save for the distinctly corny and/or hokey lines(and TMI), the dialog is decent and serves its purpose. There is scattered language(on that, mostly Russian and the other foreign tongues are spoken when they would be so, yet it's not difficult to follow) of varying degrees throughout, seldom too harsh. The tone is fairly light, arguably inappropriate(think of the subject matter... this almost goes entirely in the other direction, and underplays the severity of what takes place), and the youthfulness of this got to be downright silly, as did the excessive modernizing. The former can probably be attributed to the director, and while that worked for Sneakers(we do consider that to be a well-produced effort, mind you), it should perhaps not be found in a serious, political thriller with the intention of being smart. That might have also have affected the feeling of danger, presumably inadvertently, as the first half of this really didn't have us on the edge of our seats. With few exceptions, the way this was shot and edited is rather nice. The gadgets and some of the situation resolutions seem out of place. A fight comes off as tacked on. This doesn't go as far as certain things indicated it would. The Hollywood factor(not eternally present here) of this(above what the preceding pictures had), and the abrupt and oversimplified fix-all ending hurt the credibility and value of this. The special effects are marvelous, albeit a single sequence did inspire my better half to point out how much it looked like a video-game. The DVD contains several well-done and interesting enough featurettes, the theatrical trailer(it does reveal important plot, as does the description on the main page here, new viewers may want to avoid them until after, if they're worried about spoilers) and a commentary track with Robinson and the cinematographer, and a second with Clancy(who picks it apart mercilessly, and adds his dry, biting wit and irony, as well as swearing, expertise and name-dropping) in addition to Phil(both are informational and worth the listen). I recommend this to any fan of Jack Ryan, the people who made this and/or Tom Clancy. Do bring a solid dose of salt, for all the stuff in this that is best taken with a grain of that. 7/10",The Sum of All Fears

As it so happens the war in Chechnya is a current concern of the President of the United States ""President Fowler"" (James Cromwell) and he wants to know everything about President Nemerov that he can. However, when a rogue general resorts to chemical warfare President Fowler rejects Jack Ryan's assertions that President Nemerov did not order it. This causes any further advice by Jack Ryan to be treated with equal disdain when something big happens. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie had plenty of action and suspense but a few scenes lacked realism which caused the movie to seem a little implausible here and there.

Credit the particular genius of Tom Clancy and his memorable creation of the main character in these suspense/espionage thrillers for that, but at the same time much credit is due screenwriters Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne for the tense dialogue and DiRector Phil Alden Robinson for the pacing of this story. As far as the story is concerned, very briefly the essence can be summarized as follows: When the president of Russia suddenly dies, a man whose politics are virtually unknown succeeds him. The change in political leaders sparks paranoia among American CIA officials, so CIA director Bill Cabot recruits a young analyst to supply insight and advice on the situation. Then the unthinkable happens: a nuclear bomb explodes in a U.S. city, and America is quick to blame the Russians.Jack Ryan was a role that seemed to belong to Harrison Ford in the other Clancy films, but here that role is assumed very well indeed by Ben Affleck. He is capably assisted by Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Bruce McGill, Liev Schreiber and Philip Baker Hall along with a large cast of supporting actors.

26,namashi_1,Fairly Interesting...,6,11 August 2010,"Based on a book of the same name by Tom Clancy, 'The Sum Of All Fears' is a fairly interesting film, that begins with a bang, but loses the fizz 60-minutes into the film. The problem? Too many complications, and a weak culmination spoils the fun. Yet in all fairness, it has it's share of moments.Clancy's favorite character Jack Ryan returns as CIA analyst who must thwart the plans of a terrorist faction that threatens to induce a catastrophic conflict between the United States and Russia's newly elected president by detonating a nuclear weapon at a football game in Baltimore.The concept, like any of Clancy's best sellers is absorbing. But reading is a different experience, and watching is a different experience. 'The Sum Of All Fears' beings with a bang, in fact the first 40-45 minutes are hugely gripping. But it loses the fizz in the latter hour. The culmination, is a complete spoilsport. It is not at all convincing.Phil Alden Robinson's direction is just right. The adapted screenplay is flawed. John Lindley's Cinematography is nice. In the acting department, Ben Affleck gets it right this time. Morgan Freeman in a supporting role, is dignified. James Cromwell is a complete letdown this time around. Liev Schreiber is hardly there. Bridget Moynahan does a fine job.On the whole, not a taunt-thriller in any aspect.

27,JamesHitchcock,Memo to Hollywood: The Cold War Is Over,6,7 March 2011,"""The Sum of All Fears"" is the fourth film in the Jack Ryan franchise, but no attempt is made to maintain continuity with the earlier three episodes. No longer is Ryan the middle-aged family man portrayed by Harrison Ford in ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger""; Ben Affleck's character is far younger than Ford's, younger even than Alec Baldwin's in ""The Hunt for Red October"", even though that film was set in 1984 and ""The Sum of All Fears"" in 2002 or 2003. Whereas Ford's character was married, Affleck's is a bachelor, although he has a girlfriend with the same name, Cathy, as Ryan's wife in the earlier films. At a time of rising international tension between America and Russia, the city of Baltimore is destroyed by a nuclear device. The real culprits are neo-Nazi terrorists, but everyone in America assumes that the Russians are responsible, an assumption which is strengthened when a rogue Russian general orders an air attack on a US aircraft carrier. Ryan, a CIA analyst, is one of the few people in America who realises that the bomb which destroyed Baltimore did not come from Russia, and has to try to persuade the trigger-happy American President, J. Robert Fowler, before he can order a revenge attack. This was one of the few films from the early 2000s which did not earn Ben Affleck a Razzie nomination. He has never been my favourite actor, but at least he is better in ""The Sum of All Fears"" than in many of his films- certainly a lot better than in, say, ""Pearl Harbor"" from the previous year. Even so, he never quite brings the authority to the part that Baldwin and Ford did in the three previous Ryan films. The best acting performance comes from the normally reliable Morgan Freeman as Ryan's boss, CIA Director William Cabot. The script makes a few changes from Tom Clancy's novel, but these were largely made for the sake of political correctness rather than plausibility. Clancy's terrorists were Arab nationalists; here they are neo-Nazis who make convenient villains because virtually everyone hates them and they won't alienate any ethnic groups among the target audience. Director Phil Alden Robinson declared that he did not wish to promote negative images of Muslims or Arabs, but he seemed less concerned about promoting negative images of Russians. Early in the film were hear that the Russian Army has launched a massive chemical warfare attack on Chechnya; although it transpires that this was carried out by maverick commanders without the approval of their Government, the Russian President nevertheless decides to take the ""credit"" for it on the grounds that it is better to be seen as a mass-murderer than as an incompetent weakling. It is a general rule in the cinema that political thrillers, if they are to remain thrilling, should be set in the present or the near future. There is a partial exception for films based on real events, like ""K-19 the Widowmaker"" or ""Thirteen Days"" about the Cuban missile crisis, but this does not apply to purely fictional stories. There would have been little point in making ""The Sum of All Fears"" as a Cold War period piece set in the sixties or seventies as everyone knows that nuclear war never broke out between the superpowers during that era. Unfortunately, I was never sure what the point was of making the film at all. As a thriller, the film is fairly exciting, but its main problem is that it is stuck in the past and reflects American/Russian relationships as they were in 1962 or 1982, not as they were in 2002. The second half of the film concentrates too much on political intrigue and not enough on what is happening in the devastated city- we never even learn how many people have died. The plot-line seems more suited to the Cold War era than it does to the early twenty-first century, and indeed was looking a bit rusty even when Clancy published his novel in 1991, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Given that the 9/11 attacks took place shortly after filming was completed, and several months before the film opened in May 2002, Robinson might indeed have looked more prescient had he made a film about Middle Eastern terrorism rather than trying to rehash something like ""Fail-Safe"" for the modern age. 6/10",The Sum of All Fears

The film is very intense and I would recommend it for a watch on a Saturday. But this isn't something I'd really watch again because it lost me in a few places in the story.

30,MovieAddict2016,Read the Book...,7,23 December 2002,"""The Sum of All Fears,"" based on the # 1 New York Times bestselling novel by Tom Clancy, features Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, a historian who somehow or another, by writing a paper on the new Russian leader, is spotted by the CIA Deputy Director (Morgan Freeman).  ""The Sum of All Fears"" is even more powerful in this day and age, but nevertheless, it stands nowhere near as great as the novel, which is usually the case with films taken from books. In the following I will point out some differences that weren't crucial to my opinion on the film, but just interesting. The film is a prequel to the other Jack Ryan films, while the novel was a sequel to the other books. In the book, a lost Israeli nuclear warhead is picked up by Arabs some twenty years after the war it was lost in. In the film, a modern-age Hitler is attempting to begin turmoil between Russia and the U.S. with the nuke -- there are no arabs. Also in the novel, the way the bomb was sneaked into the superbowl was much more interesting than the method they used in the film. Also, in the book, Morgan Freeman's character was a dumb man who hid throughout the novel. In the film he's a hero. There's countless other things that don't really matter, but still made me a bit disappointed in the film. The film was in no way awful, and is the best Tom Clancy movie to date, but it's still not as good as the book.3.5/5 stars --John Ulmer",The Sum of All Fears

This movie is based on one of Tom Clancy's novel. Although I never read any Tom Clancy books so far, this was actually a intelligent and well constructed thriller. And even has quite a bit of suspense to it because of the subject matter. Even if some parts of this movie is just too far-fetched or just not realistic. The story is about a guy named Jack Ryan(Ben Affleck) who works for the CIA in bringing information to the people that makes the decisions. And throughout the movie basically the only one that knows exactly what is going on but also a person almost no one listens to. And he teams up with a CIA Director William Cabot(Morgan Freeman) Freeman is just always great as these team leader or mentor types of roles. But the main enemy rises, which isn't completely Russia this time around but neo-fascists. Who are trying to frame Russia for a major bombing in the US so they could go to war with each other and destroy one another. So the president of both nations are put in a position where they are pushed into a corner and nuke each others nations. With people that work for the leaders of both nations antagonizing them to strike back and others trying to ask for more patience. And it's up to Tom Clancy's trademark character Jack Ryan to bring the right information to the people that makes the decisions before it's too late. I don't know if it's because we are currently in a time period where America and North Korea might go to nuclear war with each other. Which adds to the fear when watching a movie like this but it does add to the suspense. When I saw this movie when it first came out, I was in elementary so couldn't comprehend everything that was going on but still found it a entertaining movie. But now that I am older I can appreciate movies like this. Even if the characters are very one dimensional and doesn't bring out much emotions this is still a well constructed thriller that is entertaining and suspenseful.8.3/10",The Sum of All Fears
33,dromasca,Fears Confirmed!,7,26 September 2002,"Whoever goes to a Clancy Movie knows what to expect. With the right mood in mind this film is quite good. Good pace, a reasonable script, at least until the authors wants to make us believe that really the good American hero can save bare-handed (well, he has a phone) the world. The big and main problem is the casting. None of the two presidents (the Russian and the American) are really what a Russian or American president are supposed to look or act like. Ben Affleck is the bigger mis-cast of all. First, he is too young for the role, then he is so much lacking any personality that I am pretty sure I can cross the stree near him and not recognize despite the fact that I am told I saw him in at least five films.

36,secondtake,"Even worse because it is so full of itself. It has moments, but it's a pastiche and an insult",5,24 February 2011,"The Sum of All Fears (2002)A bit of cold war redux. It's patched together, not quite incoherent (as some reviews on its release claimed) but one thing does not necessarily lead to another. The lead CIA dude in charge is a typically dull Ben Affleck (however hard he tries), and too much depends on him at times to really work. The plot, for 2002, is thick and thicker, dredging up both 1960s Cold War fears and WWII Nazi anger, too. At times you want to throw up your hands and just say, stop!You can't argue against high drama for its own sake, I suppose--love, loyalty, a stadium full of innocents, Israel and the Ukraine and Langley and a pair of firmly reasonable Russian and American leaders. It has the makings of a serious movie, the Tom Clancy basis notwithstanding (he's an airport novelist at best), but it has too many fault lines and strained effects. And it pushes its drama like a hungry pig at the trough. Note the ending, if nothing else, for proof--not the cutesy part about the engagement, but the five minutes before that, a kind of homage to the famous wedding sequence in ""The Godfather"" where two opposite plots and sentiments are aligned in classic parallel editing.This isn't quite a disaster of a film. It has some neat movie-making moments, like the way they recreate the high secrecy of the Defense Department, or the brief atomic bomb sequences. Morgan Freeman seems to be convincing as anything he wants to be in film, and he is a central high point again and again. In fact, the movie takes off when he first appears, and it disintegrates when his role is done. Liev Schrieber can be wonderful and he's strong here, but isn't given enough rope to make his character have distinction. Taking all this further, I think it is at times an insulting movie, making schlock out of the most fearsome and serious of 20th Century issues. You also invariably remember the great Cold War films straight out of the cold war, like ""Fail-Safe"" and ""The Bedford Incident"" among several others, all of which have the horror and terrifying lack of control intact. And of course to bring out the Nazis again (as so many films do, I guess because we have a cultural hatred of them that's still draws water at the well) is just too much. Not that they don't exist, but that they don't contribute here.I wouldn't waste my time in particular, but if you are stick in Baltimore in a motel room and this comes on, you might, possibly, do worse.",The Sum of All Fears

Choosing Ben Affleck to take over for Harrison Ford was not a very popular decision, and I was one of those people. I was so livid I decided to boycott this movie. It turns out I really had no reason to. This movie is not as good as Patriot Games or Clear & Present Danger, but it's far from an embarrassment. It's competently done with some pretty good build-up in the first half. I especially enjoyed the banter between Ben Affleck & Morgan Freeman. I did feel it was a bit too political heavy at times, but that's a minor carp. It's not filled with action, but it does have more than enough tension to keep you on the edge of your seat. Ben Affleck is actually quite alright here. I didn't think he was great by a long shot, but he managed to hold his own for the most part. Considering he's the reason I boycotted this movie, I have to commend the man. He tried hard and did a fairly decent job. He's proved to be a good actor these days with stuff like The Town, Argo, etc. Morgan Freeman adds a touch of class. He's a joy to watch, as he is in almost everything. James Cromwell is OK as the president. I liked his intensity, not much else. Final Thoughts: Not bad. Not bad at all.

38,tabuno,A Declicate Brush Stroke in this Espionage Thriller,9,17 January 2019,"16 March 2013. Of all the Jack Ryan movies, Ben Affleck of now Argo (2012) fame, finds himself again in superior, mental espionage thriller that relies the least on spectacular action thrills as the powerful Deja Vu (2006) or Bourne Identity series and dizzy stunts of any Jack Ryan movie and almost all the contemporary spy movies of the last decade, except for the less than world peace at stake in The Tailor of Panama (2001) or the more recent remake Tinker Tailor Soldier (Spy 2011). Instead The Sum of All Fears perhaps comes closer to The Russia House (1990) and The Three Days of Condor (1975) in a psychological, mental way or the more recent The Good Shepard (2006). However unlike the very personal story and experience of an spy as in The Ipcress Files (1965), The Spy Who Came In From The Cold (1965), the much edgier Spartan (2004), Breach (2007) or the more convoluted avant garde art film of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), The Sum of All Fears is the basic all-American spy movie with a mental bent.But this version of espionage also captivates and titillates with mind with its personal high stakes climax. Interestingly enough Jack Ryan in this movie isn't some super hero with years of military special ops training that it seems is left to Liev Schreiber's character. This rare division of this somewhat ensemble casting makes this movie much more believable. The personal emotive interaction between the various Presidents of the United States and Russia are taut and on par with the classic cold war Fail Safe (1964) and offering the more balanced flavor of Body of Lies (2008).What is remarkable about this movie is the storyline and its underplaying the action in this movie while the connecting the dots and continuing the strong investigative detail that Jack Ryan's movies and Tom Clancy the novelists have excelled at. This movie has the delicate balance of character reveal, relational empathy, and editing that makes this movie very effective all the way through to the more sedate but just as impactful ending.Unlike the James Bond movies, the audience doesn't have to suspend disbelief in the impossibility of the plot and characters and In Sum of All Fears, it allows its audience to retain the plausibility that makes for all the more intimate and riveting as well as captivating lure of this movie as such the sci fi thriller Andromeda Strain (1971).",The Sum of All Fears
39,paulclaassen,Entertaining political thriller.,6,28 November 2020,"Often, political thrillers have the tendency to be tedious. However, director Phil Alden Robinson gave this a different approach. The story is told in a very easy to follow manner, and subtle humor via means of dialogue or character actions was highly effective, allowing for lightheartedness without ruining any of the suspense. Although there is quite a bit of talk during the first half, it really is never boring and the score was also very good.The film features excellent performances by an all-star cast. Ben Affleck leads the cast as CIA Agent Jack Ryan and we follow his perspective on a very serious matter that might start a war. As I said, it takes a while before the action arrives, but when it does, it is fast-paced and nail-biting, thrilling action. 'The Sum of all Fears' is a very stylish political drama thriller and a great production in general.'The Sum of all Fears' earned nearly $194 million on a $68 million budget.",The Sum of All Fears
40,Dr_Coulardeau,Political war science fiction is always propaganda,7,5 December 2007,"This film could have been a good one. It came out after 9/11 but before Iraq, at the time of Afghanistan. It is about the ""final"" confrontation between the USA and Russia. A nuclear terrorist attack is organized in Baltimore so that the USA may believe it comes from the Russians and may start the procedure leading to a full out nuclear war. From the very start the theory that is illustrated here is that terror in the world is organized by the Israeli secret services with the help of some western autonomous adventurers and with the complicity of the hard liners in the Russian and Ukrainian armies. Then the whole story is difficult to believe because of the total lack of real believable hard facts. The American president appears as quite manipulated by his own military personnel and his State and Defense Secretaries, without speaking of the CIA. The Russian president appears just as much manipulated but with maybe a little bit more nerve. The whole plot fails because a small CIA intellectual agent manages to speak to the Russian president directly via the red telephone and make him take the decision to halt his alert, a decision that the US president immediately imitates. How can we believe that. The Weapons of Mass Destruction are quoted in some remote small sentence somewhere unimportant but the propaganda is clear. The various actors of this plot are then eliminated one after the other in the most radical way possible. That's a shame in a way because the film is rather well made and acted but it is obvious war propaganda that supports the theory pretending the world is being manipulated if not controlled by the Israelis, a resurgence of sorts of the old hitlerian anti-semitism of old. I guess some believe that good old hate-theories can always be revived in a way or another, with a little bit of upgrading if necessary.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",The Sum of All Fears
41,Floated2,Dull and confusing,2,8 October 2019,"Having no knowledge of the Tom Clancy novels and haven't seen any of the previous Jack Ryan adaptation films, but being somewhat familiar with its premise. Am basing this film on its own merit. Generally found this film to be quite slow, dull and overall not very entertaining. Much of it was quite confusing and a plot which seemed repetitive. Lack of suspense, lack of thrills and lack of mystery.Being a fan of Ben Affleck, didn't find his performance too great. Morgan Freeman is seemingly playing a character he has played many times before. Also with a two hour run time, this film definitely felt long. Can see as to why this film was a box office flop.",The Sum of All Fears
42,johnnyboyz,Too many flaws and minor frustrations to make this a truly memorable espionage thriller.,6,14 April 2007,"Although not being heavily into espionage films on a personal level, I do enjoy the odd spy thriller every once in a while. The fact I was brought up on James Bond films from the Connery era through to end of Moore's reign is probably the sole ingredient that my liking of an espionage film every once in a while is a matter of fact. The genre has also been given a recent boost thanks to films like Goldeneye and the Bourne series. Even if this was my first expedition into the Clancy/Ryan world, I was overall, a little disappointed.The film is steady, if not unspectacular pretty much from the off. Various characters are introduced and the actual situation is introduced in a steady and very planned manner. I liked the idea of a nuclear warhead out in the open from the very beginning; going against what Goldeneye did by revolving the early part of its plot around the planning and stealing of the device although it probably, in truth, worked better that way. Credit to The Sum of All Fears though; as the way it did it was refreshing.As for the characters, we have the president of the United States played by, as ever, a middle aged aging man that has a miniature army of suits running around him doing most of the work, we have an expert and mentor to the film's hero who is at first above the protagonist in question and then we have the man himself: Jack Ryan. Even though I'm no expert, I know that this isn't Ryan's first adventure and having a young Ben Affleck play the lead did misfire but I don't blame Affleck because the character, by now, is so experienced thanks to his previous expeditions, does he really need all the mentoring and 'kid' small talk thrown in his direction? It would seem the producers used relatively elder actors such as Baldwin and Ford for the first films but then opted for youth for the latter film in the series odd film-making. Thanks to this, I got the feeling this was his very first assignment.What slows the film down is, ultimately, a poor script. We hover around Ryan and his girlfriend too much in the early scenes; something that turned out to be a pointless exercise when we should be spending this time introducing the villain and having him set up his plan as a good spy/espionage film needs a villain of some sorts. As it is, we get about ten seconds in total of a guy I didn't actually catch the name of talk nastily down the phone to some Arabs or something about the bomb that has been found. All that I conjured was that he was a South African. This lack of a villain came back and bit the film later on, as well.Another nag I felt consisted of everything up until the bomb exploding in Baltimore. It felt that everything was really, just building up to this one moment and when it actually came; I distinctly felt the film speed up in an odd way; it stuck with the same subject matter of people bickering and talking to one another but now, everything actually meant something as a terrorist attack had actually occurred. Shortly after this event however, we see Jack Ryan running through the remains of Baltimore or some other place affected by the blast. He manages to use a cell phone or something, gets in contact with a V.I.P and the use of slow motion as he gets out of the situation was all a bit silly.Like I was saying with the lack of a villain, the film suffers in its middle third as there are no real obstacles for Ryan to overcome. There are no fights for him to fight apart from maybe a scrap with a guard in a warehouse from whom he wants information from but Ryan leaves without it; just as his allies arrive and subdue his enemy. In the end, the tension between America and Russia and their nuclear war threats are rather predictably concluded.Although scraping by with what it does, the film never really feels like a roller-coaster ride of suspicion and intrigue as good espionage films should. Ryan gets by on the rare occasions he's tested, mostly thanks to impossible logic, and the only 'bad guy' or thing that does any destruction in the film is actually the nuclear bomb everything revolves around at the beginning. Not good, not great but not a total disaster.",The Sum of All Fears
43,filipemanuelneto,Entertainment with hints of criticism.,5,23 March 2019,"The film begins with the death of a moderate Russian president and his replacement by a radical named Nemerov. To know who they are dealing with, the American Government recruits an academic who has just written an article about it. However, there seems to be a drop in the loyalty of Russian officials and there are personnel willing to provoke a nuclear war between both countries.The film is a regular thriller based on yet another imminent threat of war between the major world powers. The first part of the film prepares the events, while the rest is the unfolding and worsening of the military crisis, already in a climate of war. For me, the plot worked reasonably, taking some questions of logic and plausibility that seem to me very relevant (such as the fact that the military did not go in search of the nuclear bomb that the plane was carrying when it crashed, or the quiet walks that certain characters give the scenario where, hours before, a devastating nuclear bomb exploded).The cast is satisfactory to the level of this film: Morgan Freeman is competent, to see Richard Marner again was a pleasant surprise and James Cromwell did his part well. Ben Affleck, in turn, sounds a lot to himself and to dozens of other characters. There are few differences between this character and the one he offered us in ""Armageddon"".From the technical point of view, I emphasize the excellent cinematography and the good use of colors, but also the effects of contrast and dark light. There may have been, in part of the film, a change of lens for more diffused luminance when necessary. The special effects and sound effects are also very good, except for the scene where the bomb explodes, because it never seemed realistic enough to be believable.Overall, it's a medium movie, which is not terribly good or truly inedible. Nice to see, it's not the kind of movie that makes us think.",The Sum of All Fears

The only moment we can see this reunion is at our national day with our military review (as the old days of soviets). Maybe we think that art can't mess with politics but art is truth and liberty and politics can't mess with that. Thus, watching all this technology and all those acronyms left me speechless.On the other hand, it's also a miracle to have the commentary of an author whose book is adapted. The less I can say is that Clancy isn't indulgent: ""that's crap; that's bullshit; it's wrong"". The most exquisite are his first words: "" I'm the author of the book they choose to ignore"".Those things said, this American Bond was interesting until the bomb exploded. After, with thousand people killed, the movie focus on the President and as the actor has the charisma of a amoeba, it's become dull.

45,Anonymous_Maxine,The latest installment in the brilliant Jack Ryan series from Tom Clancy falls tremendously short of it's predecessors.,6,2 January 2003,"The Sum of All Fears is exactly what it was advertised to be - a fast paced military/political thriller, and it even comes out bearing more weight than originally intended because of the effects on the world of the September 11th attacks, which occurred before the film was released but after it was filmed. Ben Affleck stars as Jack Ryan in this film, but is not able to capture the same power and effectiveness of Harrison Ford' or even Alec Baldwin's Ryan. I've heard a lot of people complain that Jack Ryan is younger in this film than he was in the last ones, and that this is somehow supposed to count against the film. Maybe this is a prequel. Maybe they wanted to give the series a boost with young actors. Maybe it took place earlier in Jack Ryan's career. Who cares? Did you not notice the lowly profession that Ryan was also given in this film? It doesn't matter even a tiny bit that Jack Ryan is younger here than he was in Clear and Present Danger. I would think that if you missed the plethora of ligitimate reasons to pick this movie apart and had to focus instead on Ryan's appearance, you would at least be more concerned about his strange ability to morph into completely different people from film to film. As far as being an involving and tense thriller, The Sum of All Fears delivers spectacularly. It has a brilliant story that involves a right-wing neo-Nazi with the idea that with the use of a nuclear weapon he could create a war between two of the most powerful nations in the world (America and Russia), and the Aryan fascists could take over in the radioactive aftermath. I was particularly impressed that the film has the guts to portray the Americans as the primary aggressors (although also as a country led by a lot of men capable of yelling at each other like high school kids at a time when their focus is more crucial than ever) and the Russians as the ones that are the first to agree to back down. The film starts to trip a little bit when it pits Ryan, now a lowly analyst with little to no say in the proceedings during the government meetings, as the only man capable of preventing World War III because of information that he has about the origin of the bomb that was detonated in Baltimore at the Super Bowl, killing thousands and thousands of people and infecting countless more with radiation (as well as providing the most shocking scene in the entire film). It's such a disappointment to see such a strong film brought down by so much cheesy Hollywood crap, it's almost like a Schwarzenegger movie or a Van Damme  movie or a Steven Seagal movie, where everything is up to one man to come in and save the day. If there is only one thing that The Sum of All Fears has more than it's share of, it is cheesy Hollywood crap. Aside from the hero-of-the-day structure, the film races along at a fever pitch as the tension between Russia and America comes to a head, with each country holding a twitchy finger over the big red button, but it is anchored down by a lumbering romantic subplot that, like just about every Jerry Bruckheimer movie ever made, does nothing but stop the film in its tracks and vainly attempt to attract a female audience. The film is weighed down by things like this, and by it's awkward attention to detail, which is tremendously informative about things like military tactics and national security, but glosses over things like a missing nuclear weapon (I would think that there would have been at least ONE person who casually mentioned at any point after the bomb went missing in 1973, ""Hey, what ever happened to that nuclear weapon that we sent up on that plane that no one ever saw again?""). (spoilers) I'm not even so concerned about the sudden installment of a girlfriend into Jack Ryan's life, but more with the fact that the movie is so reductive about the tragedy that occurred in Baltimore, and this goes on throughout the entire film. When William Cabot dies, for example, the last thing that he says is to ask if Ryan's girlfriend is okay. On the one hand, I can understand that in such an explosion, most people would be most concerned about people they knew who may have been hurt, but in the film, this is done so that when we see them having a cute little picnic on the White House lawn at the end of the film, it means that all ends happily and thousands and thousands of people were not really killed in that explosion we saw earlier. The end of the film is one of the most intensely disappointing endings I have ever seen, by far overshadowing the weighty drab of the romance and the hero plot and the fact that we never find out what that gift was that Ryan's fairy godfather gave him for his and his girlfriend's anniversary, which he mysteriously knew about. I am not saying that The Sum of All Fears is a trashy or bad movie, it is a capable thriller with an excellent story that is able to survive the characteristics that it has in common with the typical  Bruckheimer films, but it's weaknesses are emphasized by the juxtaposition of it's enormous potential and the goofy crap that was thrown in and which had such a massively negative impact on the film as a whole. Like Pearl Harbor, this movie could very easily have been a truly great film with real life meaning, but instead they chose to gloss it over and sugar-coat the painful content, making the audience look the other way at the cute couple at the end of the film and convince themselves that if such an event occurred in real life (an event which has been described as `inevitable'), a picnic on the White House lawn is how it would all end. Sadly, in real life, I think people would be a lot more concerned about the burning radioactive rubble that used to be Baltimore than they would be about that cute couple eating sandwiches in front of the White House.",The Sum of All Fears
46,bsmith5552,Jack Ryan Saves the World!,7,10 November 2002,"""The Sum of All Fears"" is the latest film in the Jack Ryan series as written by Tom Clancy. In the previous films, Ryan was presented as a family man and played by Alex Baldwin and Harrison Ford. This time around we are asked to accept a Ryan who is 25 years younger (Ben Affleck), unmarried and a nerdy, wet behind the ears CIA historian. The age difference would have been more believable had the film been set in 1973, when the story begins, rather than the present. Anyway, the story is about a disgruntled ex-Nazi, Dressler (Alan Bates) who acquires a nuclear device and plans to instigate a war between the USA and Russia and then take over when the super powers destroy each other. The new Russian President, Nemerov (Ciaran Hinds) is set up by Dressler to be blamed for a nuculear attack which wipes out a large part of Baltimore. U.S. President Fowler (James Cromwell) calls in the CIA headed by William Cabot (Morgan Freeman).  Cabot enlists the aide of historian Jack Ryan (Affleck) because Ryan has done a thorough study on Nemerov. Ryan believes the Russian to be innocent even though all around him believe him guilty. As each side prepares to launch their respective missles, Ryan and CIA Operative John Clark (Liev Schrieber) are busily gathering information and Ryan is racing against the clock to convince Fowler of Nemenov's innocence. Affleck tries his best to make us forget Harrison Ford but to no avail. He simply cannot be taken seriously as the man who holds the world's fate in his hands. Freeman is excellent as always and Cromwell and Hinds stand out as the two world leaders. Bates makes a nasty villain and Schrieber is good as the mysterious man with a past, Clark. Bridget Moynahan appears as Affleck's love interest and future wife. The real star of the picture are the special effects. The nuclear explosion is realistic and believable and the attack on the aircraft carrier is equally good. I hope that in the next Jack Ryan movie, he is portrayed by someone who is at least old enough to shave.",The Sum of All Fears
47,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,4 April 2021,"9-11 killed this.Grant you, Affleck sucks and Affleck trying to fill Ford's shoes is even worse.... but the blame is on 9-11 because Ben did a pretty OK job and Freeman....... OK Freeman seems a little too much like everybody's father to be a spy, even a good spy. Morgan Freeman, he's someone EVERYBODY LOVES, someone everybody assumes they will like and trust... and he's playing a spy, who you have to assume you won't like or trust....... but he's playing a spy that is a father like figure to Affleck, so it works in that regard. It sort of works, the mentor role makes you look beyond a character that is otherwise opposed to every emotion you associate with Freeman... so it kind of works, and he is always watchable.But, moving on, Affleck actually does a kind of OK job here which is always shocking. Casey is reliable for a good job, but Ben, no... usually just no. ANd yet here he nails it.So what's the problem? A terrorist attack on US soil and a 2002 release date.It wasn't trading Ford (who is ALWAYS likeable) for Affleck, it wasn't trading. It wasn't trading James Earl Jones (who is ALWAYS Darth Vader) for Freeman (who is just as beloved of a documentary narrator) that killed it. Neither of those things fail, and they both kind of work.It was the terrorist attack on US soil followed by a 2002 release date that made people not like this.Otherwise, it's not a bad film.

Cataclysms, the horrific paycheck that can go with politically disingenuous power blocks, questions about the balance of power and how we can achieve greater global stability in a world that is still not free of nuclear arms. But no, none of this - but it least it lasts long enough to justify a megaton of popcorn.Even using more of the original novel (which had Israeli extremists rather than Neo-Nazis) might have yielded some intellectual component. Some decent characterization and casting might have helped too. But it was entertaining enough, overlooking these flaws, until it totally ran out of steam . . .
'Ben Affleck saves the world' is as about as convincing as 'Hugh Grant plays Othello'. So is the squeaky clean CIA and all-American plot (squeaky clean enough to draw assistance from the CIA and American military of course - check out the credits). Johnny Depp or even (remembering Three Kings) George Clooney might have injected some moral integrity into the roles, but there again - they tend to be fussier about the films they work in.A plot involving terrorists that have real issues with American foreign policy might have been intellectually engaging - whereas the actual villains are more akin to the 'Dr Evil' of Austin Powers movies   in their one-dimensional 'evil-ness' - a suitable match perhaps against the toy-boy appeal of Affleck - though why, on earth, did Morgan Freeman bother??The plot itself has as much sophistication as a boys comic story. The latest 'Star Wars' comes to mind. And Bridget Moynahan (Coyote Ugly) as a doctor? She reminded me Cameron Diaz's 'doctor' character in 'Something about Mary' - aren't doctors supposed to be able to occasionally exhibit more intelligence than token eye candy characters??",The Sum of All Fears

Whilst the story is quite engaging and the screenplay does allow for some jokey humour from time to time (some of which is amusing) The Sum Of All Fears is in no rush to tell its story and get to the meat of the action; personally I found the film a bit too talkative and it only really starts to become a bit more exciting in its final quarter.Naturally given this is a 'conspiracy related- thriller' there is a third wheel involved in the film (in this case a disgruntled neo-Nazi madman). I've not read the novel upon which this film is based on so not sure how things are played out in the book, but for me this aspect of the story was a little underdeveloped and I think a little more insight on this 'madman' may have made the film a tad more involving - it seems to pretty much focus all of its attention on the war brewing between East and West which makes the film feel a bit imbalanced.The performances from all involved are so-so; there are no bad performances. but none that really stand-out either. One positive with this film is that, unlike some other conspiracy related films, The Sum Of All Fears doesn't tie itself in knots and end up becoming over-complicated which was a welcome sight to this viewer.The Sum Of All Fears is not mind-blowingly brilliant and nor is it the most exciting picture ever made, but those that enjoy films within this genre shouldn't be disappointed.",The Sum of All Fears

54,NateWatchesCoolMovies,My preferred Ryan film,7,10 June 2017,"Surprisingly, The Sum Of All Fears is my favourite film version of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels. Alec Baldwin did a bang up job in the superb Hunt For Red October, Harrison Ford held his in two beyond excellent entries, and we won't speak of the Chris Pine/Keira Knightley snooze-palooza from a few years back. Why then do I gravitate towards this Ben Affleck incarnation? Who knows. Battfleck himself makes an adequate, inquisitive Ryan, on the younger end of the rope and under the guidance of CIA Yoda Morgan Freeman. I think it's the early 00's tone of the film itself though, the whip smart editing, Bourne-style escalation of suspense and terrific ensemble cast, a hallmark among Clancy films. Affleck embodies a younger, inexperienced Ryan whose infamous intuition is just breaching the surface of his character, right on time for a deadly plot to set off a nuclear device on American soil. A German radical (Alan Bates, underplaying evil nicely) with vague ties to a Neo Nazi faction is cooking up a false flag attack against Russia, using a long dormant warhead supplied by arch mercenary Colm Feore. Or at least I think that's the crux of it, these cloak and dagger affairs can get pretty dense on you sometimes. There's a sense of global danger though, a level of stress that ratchets up until even the stoic US President (an explosive James Cromwell) begins to lose it. The Russian President (Ciaran Hinds) gravely tries to sort out the misunderstanding, whilst Clancy staple character John Clark (Liev Schreiber gives Willem Dafoe a run for his money) covertly smokes out conspirators. Unease and tension nestle into the narrative, and when that impending disaster is minutes away during a hectic NFL game, you can feel the suspense in the air. The supporting cast is rich with talent including Michael Byrne, Bruce McGill, Philip Baker Hall, Josef Sommer, Ron Rifkin, Lisa Gay Hamilton and gorgeous Bridget Moynahan as Ryan's fiancé. I've got nothing but love for Red October, Patriot Hames and Clear & Present Danger, but something about this one hit a frequency and resonated with me a little better, coming out on top as the most re-watchable, enjoyable entry.",The Sum of All Fears

Jack Ryan magically had no wife or family, suddenly a plebe within the confines of the CIA again, and the producers expect no one to notice! The football team they even used was terrible and stupid looking (why did they play in a dome when there is a football field visible in some of the sweeping helicopter shops). Anyway, all of the really good characters such as Liev Schrieber, Philip Baker Hall, James Cromwell and Morgan Freeman were all subjected to secondary status for the sake of Affleck, who doesn't deserve a role like this. While I liked this film, I will give it a 6/10 for the fact Affleck was his usual, terrible self. His brother Casey must be wondering what he did in a previous lifetime to instill such praise for the clearly inferior actor.",The Sum of All Fears

Don't expect to see a masterpiece or a very realistic movie, although it shows a possible thing to happen.We have a nice story with some surprises and twists, told in a simple way. From the beginning we know more than every character in the movie, but that doesn't matter; it is fun to watch. We have a nice Jack Ryan played by Ben Affleck. We have some nice visual effects.

58,valleyjohn,Good fun allround,8,18 March 2021,"'m going to say something controversial .
I believe that films based on Tom Clancy novels are better than films based on Ian Fleming novels. Yes that's right , Jack Ryan is better than Bond!
The evidence is plain to see.
The Hunt For Red October .
Patriot Games.
Clear and Present Danger
and this film , are all better than most of the 007 films I've seen and I've seen them all .
This is the story of CIA analyst Jack Ryan who must stop the plans of a Neo-Nazi faction that threatens to induce a catastrophic conflict between the United States and Russia's President by detonating a nuclear weapon at a football game in Baltimore, Maryland.What I like about this film is that instead of the threat of a nuclear bomb being used , as we see in most films , there is actually one used on US soil.
Sure , it doesn't dwell on it as much as it should have but there is a potential war with the ruskies to play out and that's what this gripping film concentrated on.It reminded me a lot of the film Crimson Tide but set on land .
There is some great casting .
James Cromwell is the perfect president.
Phillip Baker Hall who plays the defence Secretary is superb as the guy who wants all out retaliation and Ciaran Hinds is totally believable as the Russian President and that's without mentioning Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman who are the two main leads .I really enjoyed this .
At no stage was I bored and for once I was on the American and Russians side !Good fun all round .",The Sum of All Fears
59,Rob_Taylor,Probably the weakest of all the Jack Ryan films to date.,6,5 January 2003,"I have to say I was underwhelmed by this movie. It started off with a lot of promise and then just kind of stumbled along. There were no surprises and nothing to really make you sit up and watch. Just a slow decline to an inevitable end.That said, it's not a bad film. Though I thought more could have been done with the special effects. This had the feel of something that had virtually no budget for effects. SPOILERS. Only the attack on the carrier showed any promise. The retaliation on the Russian base was filled with stock missile-cam footage. Even the nuclear (or nucular, as many news presenters still idiotically insist on pronouncing it) blast was limited to a few shots of a mushroom cloud and a few lame blast effects.It's also worth noting that I had more fun watching the character of John Clark than that of Jack Ryan. It's always a bit of a concern in a movie with one main lead character, that you prefer to watch another, bit-part character, because his character is more interesting than that of the main character.I'm guessing also that this film may have been a prequel of sorts, since the Jack Ryan portrayed here is a bumbling idiot, to put it bluntly, with no clout whatsoever in the CIA. A far cry from the portrayals by Ford and Baldwin in the previous films. But I'm not a fan of Tom Clancy and haven't read the books. So I can't be sure.Probably the weakest of all the Jack Ryan films to date.",The Sum of All Fears
60,philip_vanderveken,Watch this movie for Morgan Freeman's performance,6,22 June 2005,"A nuclear war! Ever since the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in Japan, all people fear it. During the Cold War period (1945-1990), many movies were made in which the Americans had to fight off the USSR. Think for instance of ""Top Gun"", one of the most popular movies about this subject at that time. But even today the fear for nuclear attacks hasn't diminished. Today they fear extremists and terrorists rather than the Russians and that's exactly the idea on which the story of this movie was based.""The Sum of All Fears"" starts with the sudden death of the Russian President. He is quickly succeeded by a man whose politics are virtually unknown to Washington. The CIA is convinced that he is a hardliner and because the United States is very critical of the Russians' treatment of Chechneya, they fear the man. And their fear becomes truth when the Russian President tells them that Chechneya is an internal issue and none of their concern. CIA analyst Jack Ryan, who did research on the man, doesn't think he is a hardliner, but while Ryan and his boss, Bill Cabot, are inspecting disarmament at a Russian nuclear site, 3 Russian scientists have mysteriously disappeared. Although the Russians have explanations for their absence, none of them are true. In the meantime in Austria, a neo-fascist has developed a frightening plan to incite a war between Russia and the U.S. He will use an unexploded Israeli bomb from the deserts of the Middle East. And than the unimaginable happens: a nuclear bomb explodes in U.S. city and America is quick to blame the Russians...What I probably liked most about this movie was the acting by Morgan Freeman. That man really is a class of his own. I don't know many other actors who are able to save a rather mediocre movie like this one from complete oblivion. For the rest I don't see many other reasons why you should watch this movie. The rest of the acting is in a range from 'OK' at best to a 'could be worse' and the story is rather far-fetched, although not necessarily unbelievable. Even though I don't consider it to be very likely that a Neo-Nazi group would be able to start a nuclear war between Russia and the U.S., that doesn't mean that a terrorist attack with a 'dirty' bomb isn't possible.Overall I would say about this movie that Morgan Freeman's performance the best reason to watch it. The rest of the acting isn't very special and the story didn't really do it for me. That's also why I can only give it a 6.5/10.",The Sum of All Fears

The story keeps you guessing all the time what happens next. The mix of adventure, espionage, terrorism and war was well timed with much suspense in this film.Sometimes I was shocked how near we are today from such an event when everywhere in the arab countries terrorists attacks with suicide bombs or just think to the 11th September 2001.It is a real edge-of-your-seat thriller. Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Ben Affleck and the other actors fulfilled a very good job. Congratulations to the director and to all the stuff. The special effects were very real and the picture was very nice. The russian music from Jerry Goldsmith remembered me the one of ""AIR FORCE ONE"" that I highly recommend too.

Warning ***minor spoilers*** Had trouble with Ben Affleck in the role of Ryan, some of it not his fault as he laboured from an unbelievable script and a totally laughable ending where he is negotiating with the Russian Premier against the instructions of the US President. One man saves the world again and knows it all in spite of all the intelligence around him.  Home Alone for grownups. Some of the characters were so thinly drawn as to be tissue paper, the role of the girlfriend for one who was supposedly a doctor. Just arm candy for Ryan as not one intelligent thing comes out of her mouth apart from disbelief at his job. Also would not all these people around Baltimore be suffering from nuclear burns and like - um - cancer??? This was never addressed.  And the terrorists like hung around the stadium after the event?

63,dunmore_ego,Ford Power,4,30 January 2004,"Spoilers.Not since Marky Mark replaced Charlton Heston in Tim Burton's remarkable film about ape-poo, has there been such an inadequate, impotent re-imagining of a well-known filmic character. We went from Alec Baldwin's Runway-Model Jack Ryan (equivalent to Roger Moore's Bond), to Harrison Ford's REAL MAN Jack Ryan, a presence to be reckoned with (definitely the William Shatner of the Ryans), arriving now at the girl-child Ben Affleck, shouldering a character which he has not the imagination, let alone the acting prowess, to flesh out, trying to command respect by keeping his hairstyle trendy.Again, as in Marky Mark's Planet Of The Apes, we have the unpopular guy at school being made classroom monitor and having shoes thrown at him when he asks for quiet. Would anyone feel an inkling of reassurance in the case of a nuclear strike if Affleck's dandelion Ryan was swishing about yapping counterstrike measures in that girl-scout alto squeal?All we needed was Jason Biggs in the role of Liev Schreiber, Eric Roberts in the role of James Cromwell, and Todd (whatchoo talking' bout Willis?) Bridges playing the role of Morgan Freeman and we'd have a quorum on our hands.And didn't Harrison Ford have a full-fledged FAMILY in his Ryan movies? In this movie, with Ryan being such a young-un, did these events take place BEFORE or AFTER the first attack on the Death Star?We see Affleck in some 'steamy' embraces with his plain girlfriend, to disprove the theory that he really is Jennifer Lopez's lesbian love-interest, but there's more heat in the iceberg that rammed the Titanic.There is also some intriguing plot twist involving weapons that Americans sold to Israelis being used against America itself - ooooh, like THAT'S something new!The second half of the film, Affleck composes many exciting Instant Messages while stealing a truck, and shouts into a cellphone a lot, trying desperately to grow into the mantle of action hero which has been thrust upon him. And makes James Cromwell look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the process.An insular world of political 'leaders' all making threats, weaponry, war-gamery for their own agendas, caring nothing, DOING nothing for the rest of us in the trenches, only involving us when things blow up and it's reported by CNN. To make a movie about nuclear threat even remotely interesting these days.. DON'T make it. It's BORING. It's POINTLESS. It's not even ORIGINAL - it's yet another re-telling of Macbeth (do unto your neighbor BEFORE he does unto you).At movie's end, specifically for the Great Unwashed, James Cromwell delivers a wildly original, ineffectual speech about eliminating nuclear weapons, obviously to quell fears that were aroused during the attacks of September 11, 2001 on the American World Trade Center - yet, I seem to remember no nuclear weapons were used in that attack.. (No one quite 'gets it'. As Michael Corleone tells us: 'If history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone.' Which propounds that even the fairytale eventuality of No Nuclear Weapons will not curb Mankind's bloodlust and religious superstition - which means that even if you take away all the drugs and cigarettes and booze and guns and terrorists, people will STILL find excuses to kill each other and ways to do it.)27,000 nuclear weapons.

It would simply make no sense at all if you included this with the first three movies.But setting that aside, it is rather interesting.  Though not as good as Hunt for Red October, it's a bit better than the last two Jack Ryan films. Unfortunately, it's also less believable.  Though it is a scary thought, the idea of someone blowing away Baltimore is unlikely.The small atomic bomb scene was also fake looking.  The neo-nazi connection is bizarre.

65,DunnDeeDaGreat,A different kind of summer blockbuster,6,31 May 2002,The Sum Of All Fears is one of the first summer blockbuster's to come along that has a lack of action but is none the less entertaining. Ben Affleck plays Jack Ryan as a young cat with inexperience and his co star Morgan Freemen radiates the screen as always and Liev Schribber is good in a supporting role.

66,vip_ebriega,To 'Sum' it up... (with DVD details),8,7 July 2008,"My Take: An enjoyable political thriller set amongst turbulent times combines paranoia and cinematic thrills. With THE HUNT FOR RED October, PATRIOT GAMES and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER before it, CIA analyst turned spy hero Jack Ryan returns (and even hits the Fountain of Youth) in this fourth adaptation of another TOM Clancy bestseller, in which certainly the most relevant of the time. With the ominous and unforgettable events of 9/11 behind it, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS has become more than a mere adaptation of Clancy's bestselling novel, and more of a warning of one of the world's greatest fears: international terrorism. And while this thriller doesn't especially crackle until the second half, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS is still a terrific thriller with crisp plotting and crackling tension.However, in comparison with its hit predecessors, SUM doesn't compare to those highly superior previous films (which I really liked). Firstly, the film's approach as a ""prequel"" really leaves much plot-holes and time-lapses as it goes. While it is a prequel to the original films, SUM takes place during modern time. Instead of bringing back Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford to portray the role of CIA analyst Jack Ryan, producers opted for a much younger Ben Affleck who, while offering his best, is quite a disappointment, considering that his predecessors Baldwin and Ford are so much better, and sometimes his pretty-boy attitude gets in the way of the accurate CIA character we since have come to know. In this prequel, Ryan is still courting his future wife Cathy Muller (Bridget Moynahan) and has only just graduated from a CIA historian to analyst.For his first CIA job, Ryan is asked by then-CIA director Bill Cabot (Morgan Freeman) to accompanying him on a meeting with the new president of Russia, who is believed to be a hardliner. At the same time, they are sent to survey a nuclear base, where Ryan discovers that some of the scientists are missing. The people in-charge give a logical explanation, but Ryan knows there's something behind it all. At his quest for the truth may just lead him to the discovery of a nuclear bomb being detonated in a Baltimore Football game, in one of the film's landmark moment. The said moment may be the most show-stopping scene in the entire picture, but the rest of the film is as much a thriller is it should. Director Phil Alden Robinson does a superb job providing the tension that comes with the crackling plot, even if it leaves much to be desired when it comes to romantic moments between a young Jack and Cathy.While comparison rises between this and its predecessors, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS turns out to be the thriller it promises to be. Packed with crisp plotting and smart thrills, this is one of the more satisfying summer thrillers. Switch your brain on and pop this in your DVD.Rating: **** out of 5.The DVD: The film is featured in a 2.35:1 widescreen format guaranteed to fit the screen, and the picture quality seems clear except for some scenes shot in the dark. Special features include Audio Commentaries (with director Robinson, cinematographer John Lindley and one with novelist/executive producer Tom Clancy) as well as a trailer. Includes English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai subtitles as well as English and Thai languages. It's also featured in a crisp Dolby Digital sound, so if your sound systems up for it, the nuclear explosion scene will be a real knockout in this new DVD.

67,jhclues,A Sobering Meditation on the State of Our World Today,8,16 November 2002,"We all want to think that the world in which we live is safe and secure, that bad things only happen to the `other' guy and that evil-doers always get their just deserts.  The reality of it, however, is that we all live in glass houses built on foundations anchored in the shifting sands of happenstance, and a `reality check,' courtesy of the entertainment medium of film is not a thing to be taken lightly, discounted or dismissed out-of-hand.  `The Sum of All Fears,' directed by Phil Alden Robinson, is a cautionary tale that is thought provoking and all too valid, especially in the wake of 9/11.  As a film, it may have some minor flaws and the story is certainly disconcerting, but in light of recent events in America, as well as around the world, it makes us aware of the importance of being ever vigilant, and it's important in that it reminds us of things that must not be forgotten lest they be repeated, just as a film like `Schindler's List' will forever be a kind of safeguard against another Holocaust.  A single film may on it's own be just another brick in the wall, but if filmmakers persist, eventually that wall will perhaps become a kind of fortress that may help prevent a repetition of the blunders and crimes perpetrated throughout the history of the world.  The screenplay was adapted by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne from the novel by Tom Clancy; the story is a proposition of what could happen if a nuclear bomb fell into the wrong hands, how the preeminent governments of the world would respond and what the outcome would mean to the average citizen living in the Ukraine or in Podunk, U.S.A.  It's a hypothetical situation that, quite frankly, a few years ago would've been perceived by most as being as close to reality as `The Martian Chronicles.'  But not anymore.  Looking beyond the drama of the story and the way it's presented, the actual events depicted here are almost too close for comfort and will no doubt evoke a sense of denial in many viewers who still refuse to accept the state of the world as it is today.  The film itself is, of course, a big budget, Hollywood production-- which in not a BAD thing-- but as such the drama is a bit stiff and stilted at times, and the presentation by director Robinson lacks originality and imagination; too often we see exactly what we expect (when a member of the Russian cadre, for example, demurs to the cold reality of their plan and announces his withdrawal, we know that he's signed his own death warrant.  Seeing him garroted by the silent, hulking henchman before he reaches the door is anticlimactic; it would have been entirely more effective had Robinson taken a page from David Lean's Book and left it up to the viewer's imagination). But the performances are to the last actor solid and convincing, and late in the film the story takes a decidedly unexpected turn that allows for a suspenseful climax; after a point you can speculate as to the final outcome, but you cannot know absolutely until the very end.  As Confucius (or was it Yogi?) once said, It ain't over till it's over.The real strength of the film, though, lies in the very honest depiction of the events and the way they play out, from the unimaginable success of the terrorists to the confusion, uncertainty and irresolution of those in power. Initially, the ease with which much of what happens is seemingly effected may evoke a reaction of disbelief and incredulity; but in retrospect, in reality this is more than likely exactly the way such things would happen. But we're conditioned by not only by what we've seen in other movies (James Bond ALWAYS saves the day, doesn't he?), but by what society tells us is so and by what we WANT to believe.  Al-Qaida, however, is real; 9/11 is real. It's just not something we want to acknowledge, just as we do not want to believe that a handful of people control the destiny of the entire world, including a leader like this film's President Fowler (James Cromwell), who excels at waving to fans at a football game, talking tough and telling the people what they want to hear, but just may be clueless, ineffective and governed by personal agenda behind closed doors.  Which is precisely what this film points out in terms that are at once subtle and overt.As Jack Ryan, Ben Affleck gives an acceptable performance, and though he's convincing he lacks the intensity of his predecessor in the role, Harrison Ford, or even that of Alec Baldwin, who first created the character in 1990's `The Hunt for Red October.'  Buy this is a younger Jack Ryan, new to the C.I.A. and not yet married, which may provoke some confusion in fans of this series, as on one hand this story predates `October,' and yet the events seem to reflect more recent incidents, subsequent to all that happened in the first three `Ryan' films.  But taken as a separate entity, this film is contextually intact and stands on it's own; just be prepared to view it as an independent entry in the series with a value that supersedes any sequential necessity.The most notable performances are turned in by Morgan Freeman (Cabot) Liev Schreiber (Clark), Philip Baker Hall (Defense Secretary Becker) and Ron Rifkin (Owens).This is the kind of film that many viewers will subconsciously attempt to distance themselves from emotionally, and will take great delight in concentrating on minor technical flaws as it will enable them to sleep a little easier at night.  But in the final analysis, `The Sum of All Fears' says something about who we are, `where' we are and the state of the world in which we live today; things we would probably rather not contemplate, but nevertheless, must.",The Sum of All Fears

In the ""The Sum of All Fears"", Jack isn't even a field agent, and a far cry from the uber-agent the Harrison Ford character had become.  Very good, and somewhat against the grain for all too many action adventure heroes today. I like my characters believable and wince when they defy the laws of physics.Morgan Freeman is also very good as Jack's CIA mentor as he, Jack, and the agency try to make sense of sudden Russian belligerence and apparent acts of war. But who's really behind it? And who has the missing Israeli nuclear bomb? The first 2/3 of the movie is gripping as unseen hands maneuver Russia and America toward nuclear annihilation. But after the attack on Baltimore, the movie begins to drift into unreality. Hollywood must have felt that the ending had to be upbeat, so Jack, while not quite a superman, surely becomes the luckiest CIA employee ever. He's abetted by heretofore cunning terrorists who suddenly lose their collective IQs. And changing the terrorists from the Arabs of the novel into European neo-fascists is a blatant cop-out to political correctness, is totally unbelievable, and an act of artistic cowardice.""The Sum of All Fears"" is an effective popcorn movie, and moves the Jack Ryan franchise in the right direction.

Argon and Neon would make a better matched couple. This movie just dragged on and on (and on) and could not sustainably build suspense.

Seeing them together looks like they have starred in many other movies together, when really, this was their first teaming.The supporting cast includes James Cromwell as the President, Liev Schreiber, Philip Baker Hall, Ron Rifkin, Alan Bates as a Neo-Nazi terrorist, and Bruce McGill.

Yet, after 1994's Clear and Present Danger, the film series stalled. After eight years, though, Ryan returned to the cinema in a new, younger form, with an adaptation of Clancy's The Sum of All Fears.That new, younger Ryan was Ben Affleck. Following in the footsteps of Baldwin and Ford was a large order and one that Affleck, on the back of a string of successes, should have been able to fill. Instead, Affleck comes across as rather bland in this part, despite the good looks and intelligence he has. It's a performance that traverses between the extremes of being ineffectively wooden and cringeworthingly shouty. The scene in the White House Situation Room about midway through the film perfectly demonstrates the issues with Affleck's Ryan. Where Affleck is more successful in his interactions with Morgan Freeman's CIA director early on, or in his scenes with Bridget Moynahan as Cathy, where he can play either the fish out of water or charming boyfriend. So, while he might have been Clancy's favorite of the initial trio of Ryan actors, Affleck's Ryan comes across the weakest of the screen Ryans to date.In some ways, it might be a case that Affleck had a cast around him that highlighted the problems with his performance. Freeman's CIA director Bill Cabot isn't a flashy role, by any means, but one which he imbues with a sense of presence and authority. James Cromwell's President Fowler offers the character actor a meaty role, one which explores the different facets of decision making both at times of peace and crisis, with Cromwell bringing presence and humanity to his performance. The film also proved the Hollywood breakthrough for Irish actor Ciarán Hinds, playing the Russian leader Nemerov in a role that could have been a walking cliche but, instead, Hinds brings a sense of humanity to as a man trying to avert crisis beyond his control. Bringing to life new versions of Clancy's characters are Bridget Moynahan as Ryan's girlfriend Cathy and Liev Schreiber as agent in the field John Clark, and it remains a shame that this would prove to be their only times in the roles. With the cast being rounded off by character actors including Michael Byrne, Philip Baker Hall, Alan Bates, and Bruce McGill, it's as strong a cast as any of the Ryan outings before it.Beyond the cast, there's certainly plenty to recommend in terms of the actual production. Phil Alden Robinson proved an inspired choice for director, assembling a first-rate crew including cinematographer John Lindley. Between them, and the production design of Jeannine Oppewall, capture the behind the scenes, ""you are there"" feel of Clancy's novels and earlier films. The visual effects work on the film, some subtle in addition to more apparent sequences, come across well and have aged nicely, with the nuclear bomb detonation midway through being the film's set-piece. Finally, Jerry Goldsmith, in one of his last works, delivered a thoughtful and suspenseful score, one which highlighted growing tensions but also the hope potentially lost in the chaos. There's little doubt, then, that Sum of All Fears was well-made.Perhaps the biggest problem the film has lies in its script and, consequently, in its pacing. Taking an 800+ page Clancy novel and turning it into something that runs two hours is not an enviable task, in the slightest. Even more so when one is both updating one published a decade earlier in a very different political climate and placing it far sooner in your lead character's timeline. The result is a functional adaptation of the novel, albeit one that feels like a Cliffnotes version of it, perhaps suggesting what it needed was a miniseries rather than a feature film. In doing so, the screenwriters left the film crammed to the gills with plot. In part, because the first half has to establish, in a somewhat convincing fashion, how tensions between the US and Russia in the post-Cold War era so quickly that they can lead to the brink of nuclear war in the second half. The result is a film that feels oddly slow in its first half in places, but with the back half having too much going on, racing from place to place. Something which left Clancy fans annoyed (and the author himself to obverse on the audio commentary that he was the author of ""the book the director ignored.""), and baffled many viewers unfamiliar with the book, ultimately serving neither audience well.In the end, The Sum of All Fears proved not to be the sum of its parts. For as strong as aspects of it were, overcoming its lead actor or the issues in scripting and pacing. In a way, it's a shame that this proved to be a stillbirth for the revived franchise, which saw another reboot attempt before it moved to the small screen. Then again, given Affleck's lackluster Ryan, maybe we should be grateful that we're left with a film full of moments, but ultimately the sum of unrealized potential.",The Sum of All Fears
79,redkiwi,Just not the same,7,19 August 2002,"Ben Affleck picks up the Harrison Ford role as Jack Ryan in the latest Tom Clancy book to be ported to cinema.

81,LebowskiT1000,Great Jack Ryan Movie,10,4 June 2002,"I'll be honest, I have yet to read any of the Tom Clancy books, but I loved the films ""Hunt For Red October"", ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"".  I will also admit that I was a little skeptical of this film because I'd never heard of director, Phil Alden Robinson before, and that kind of scared me.  I loved directors John McTiernan (HFRO) and Phillip Noyce (PG and CAPD) from the other Jack Ryan films, and I just hoped that Phil Alden Robinson could do as good of a job.  I have to say that I was impressed, I thought the movie was very well done and definitely kept me interested.  This movie is definitely one of those films that I'm going to need to see two or three times before I fully understand it (I don't do so well with the political thrillers).  So, I look forward to seeing it again, and hopefully pick up on some things that I didn't catch in the first round.  All the actors in this film did a great job with their roles.  I don't think there was a single actor in the film that I didn't like.  Ben Affleck did a great job as Jack Ryan and Morgan Freeman did a great job as Bill Cabot.  I also really liked Liev Schreiber as John Clark. The only complaint I have about the film is that I wish they hadn't shown any of the nuclear explosion scenes in the trailers/previews for the film. It would definitely have had more of an impact if they hadn't shown any of those scenes in the trailer.  But, oh well, it still got me in the theater right?  Well, I want to say that if you liked the other Jack Ryan films then you'll probably like this one, but I know that everybody's opinions are different, so I hope you like the film as much as I did.  Happy viewing, and thanks for reading,-Chris",The Sum of All Fears

Morgan Freenman did an excellent job like usual in his performance. The movie was just a good thriller. The ending and at the football game just got me blown away. It ended out good and bad at the same time but still was enjoyable and entertaining. I haven't seen this movie in a long time but I can fully remember what all happened in the movie. I liked this movie, I mean I'm not going to buy it or anything but it still was fun and I like these kind of thrilling movies.

83,johnnymonsarrat,Underrated portrayal of how WWIII might happen,10,9 March 2008,"After 9-11, it's surprising that anyone thinks a nuclear bomb is not a threat to the USA. This film is an original concept in that it explores this angle and leading towards World War III in a highly realistic manner similar to the Tom Clancy books, giving us a peek into the workings of true government. This is not a James Bond style silliness where racing boats and magnetic wristwatches win the day.There's humor, good acting, the dialogue is great... the fascists are a little silly but they don't appear in the film much. Please note, immediately after 9-11 when this film came out, it was seen as divisive and possibly too painful to have Middle Eastern terrorists in a film. That's why they put in fascists instead.In short I think they do a lot with a little, using real drama to move the plot forward and not needing everyone to swing from vines and ski off of cliffs constantly.I also think that, at the time this movie came out, a lot of people were fed up with Ben Affleck and his tabloid persona. Since then, Ben has matured and produced top films such as Gone Baby Gone. I hope we can leave Ben-hatred to the past.Finally, a lot of people who read Tom Clancy's book -- as I have -- seemed to feel that any film that didn't stick perfectly to the plot must be awful. It's a black or white world for them. I disagree. Re-starting the Ryan franchise (like Batman Begins or Casino Royale, which restarted the Batman and James Bond franchises) was a good idea, in my opinion, and the script neatly places the new Ryan in the center of all the action without requiring goofy coincidences.This film is the story of a possible World War III, done perhaps in the most realistic possible way that can be dramatized. Give The Sum of All Fears a shot despite its lower rating. You'll be pleased you did.",The Sum of All Fears

85,FilmFanInTheHouse,Interesting but Confusing,6,25 April 2008,"The Sum of All Fears (2002, Dir. Phil Alden Robinson) When a terrorist faction plans to turn American against Russia by placing a nuclear weapon in a Baltimore, DCI William Cabot (Freeman) calls in CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Affleck) to figure out the plans behind this faction and prevent a total catastrophe occurs.'The Sum of All Fears' is the first movie I saw in the Tom Clancy franchise, and although I found the film fairly interesting, I ended up confused on who the actual villain it. There are no problems with the cast whatsoever. Ben Affleck gives a suitable performance, as does Morgan Freeman and Liev Schreiber. James Cromwell also gives a fantastic performance as the President. His speeches really do come across as powerful. There are some lovely scenes, with an amazing scene of the blast from a bomb in the stadium. Throughout the film, the storyline could be followed just about, but by the time it got to the end credits, I wasn't aware at all of who the actual villain is. Names were said, but apart from Jack Ryan and the President, none of the individual names were memorable enough to remember. It was an OK thriller, but is hard for me to clearly say without viewing the other films in the series.""What are three Russian atomic scientists doing in Ukraine?""  DCI William Cabot (Morgan Freeman)",The Sum of All Fears

87,buiger,This could (should) have been much better...,6,1 October 2009,"I must say I expected much more from this movie than what it actually turned out to be. This is another classic example of film Directors unable to successfully transfer a good book from paper to the big screen. There are literally hundreds of examples of this. Actually, there are very few movies that actually manage to do it well.The premise and general idea of Clancy's book is very promising, chillingly realistic. So we have great hopes for the movie too. But apart from this premise, the screenplay disavows the book, and this is when it all starts going wrong. The movie becomes a classical Hollywood action film, with many situations that are totally unrealistic, impossible, and therefore unbelievable. I never understood why most movie makers always make this mistake. A film can be ever so frightening and tense if it is realistic and believable... I will not go into detail so that I do not spoil the viewing for anyone, but suffice it to say that many situations in which Jack Ryan ends up in order to save the day could never happen in reality.And with this we come to another of the main weaknesses of this motion picture. The casting of Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan... This is definitely not for him. He is totally unbelievable as a top CIA analyst become secret agent, become superhero... Not even Morgan Freeman who is excellent (as usual) as DCI manages to provide any credibility to Affleck in his role. If anything, it makes the differences between the two performances stand out even more. Another miss-cast is Ciaran Hinds as the new Soviet leader. He looks more like a French cook than a member of the Politburo...Otherwise, the film has good cinematography and sound and very good special effects, all of which makes it a decent thriller, but unfortunately nothing more.",The Sum of All Fears

89,chrisbrown6453,Can it get any scarier than when the President of the United States is rushed out of a football stadium while thousands of clueless spectators look on?,9,7 June 2002,"The Sum of All Fears is much scarier than it might have seemed a year ago, that is, before the free world became vulnerable post 9/11. But today, it's stomach-turning. Oh, yes, there is a horrendous blast that takes place that annihilates thousands of innocent people, and is actually more explicit than one might have guessed. Of course, the movie had completed production before 9/11 and probably required some changes in some of the scenes.Is the movie any good? Oh, yes. It's one of those smart espionage thrillers from a Tom Clancy bestseller which brings hero Jack Ryan to the screen for the fourth time. Ryan has been played by Alec Baldwin in The Hunt for Red October and Harrison Ford with the so-so Patriot Games and the mildly engrossing Clear and Present Danger. This time, Jack Ryan's shoes are filled by Ben Affleck, which is like a revisionist way of looking at CIA analyst Ryan during his rookie years. He has a low-level analyst position where he writes reports, but then a key dissertation on the newly inducted Russian president (played by Ciarán Hinds) gets him the attention of CIA director William Cabot (Morgan Freeman). The story has multiple locations that jump all over the map from Western Europe, Russia and the Middle East. It all has to do with a fission bomb that has been missing for nearly thirty years, when it was dropped by an Israeli fighter jet that was shot down. American president James Cromwell holds Russia responsible once a nuclear explosion wipes out a Middle Eastern nation. Ryan's theories are shared with the President, but his shallow reports don't earn him any stars and stripes. Instead, particular details that the Pentagon may have overlooked may lead to World War III.The most suspenseful and terrorizing moments occur when a nuclear bomb is transported through customs into the United States. A trail of clues leads Ryan and CIA undercover operative Liev Schrieber to the terrorist perpetrators. Well, maybe not on time. How late is too late? Ryan is ultimately the hero of the story but he doesn't come out entirely clean after a grave disaster. This is a goosebump, ""lump-in-your-throat"" thriller that leaves one nearly exhausted, if not distraught. Spy fans will relish its complex plotting and multiple story lines. Clancy fans will be engaged by its behind-the-scenes look at government operations and with its world politics. This is yet another role where Freeman is perfectly suited as the world weary mentor and Affleck makes a game effort in playing the intractable Jack Ryan. All principles of filmmaking are excellent in a movie that seems timelier now than ever. There are some difficulties in watching it though.  You see, I can't help but be bothered by the fact that we are watching a Jack Ryan movie that takes place after all the previous, but it seems our hero, Ryan, has gotten younger.  Maybe the fountain of youth is actually inside the CIA building in Langley.  This is the exact reason why I feel that Red Dragon will be most difficult to swallow.  Watching the aged Hopkins as Lector will be difficult in a film which precedes Silence of the Lambs.  In no way should this keep you from seeing the film, it is Jack Ryan's best adventure!",The Sum of All Fears
90,p-jonsson,Totally ruined by some Hollywood dimwit changing the bad guys,1,21 November 2014,"Well, if we start with the good. The story itself is not really too bad and if you forget the title, the mention of Tom Clancy and Jack Ryan, then the movie is decent enough. It is a reasonably well implemented thriller. Not great but worth seeing.However, the book is about Arab terrorists performing terrorist acts by means of thermonuclear devices causing the two superpowers to come to the brink of a nuclear war. The movie has replaced this foe with some nonsense story about emerging neo-Nazis wanting to take over the world. This is just utter rubbish. It is obviously a political decision by some asshole not wanting to upset the Arab community so he picks a ""safe"" bad guy instead. The speech where the head Nazi compares themselves with a virus was just unintelligent writing and painful to watch.Nazis are obvious bad guys and can be put to good use in movies, just as communists and Muslim terrorists and a whole bunch of other groups, but not when the original material uses another, much more logical, foe. The original foes in the book would have some force behind them in the radical Muslim community that made their plans for world takeover after the superpowers had annihilated each other at least somewhat plausible. If you ignore minor details like that there would really not be much to take over after a barrage of nuclear missiles from USA and Russian of course. But a few twisted old Nazis that sits in hiding in dark rooms cooking together this hair-brained scheme? No way! I am sad to say that whoever asshole that decided to rewrite the main adversary of this movie ruined it totally for me. I am really happy that I never watched it when it came out in the theaters but instead watched it, in a sense ""for free"", on my Netflix subscription.",The Sum of All Fears

93,Okonh0wp,An exciting movie,8,16 May 2004,"This film is exciting and suspenseful and that has more than a little bit to do with the talk of terrorism and nuclear threats are so pervasive in the news today. Oliver Cromwell plays the dumb president, Morgan Freeman plays the slightly more intelligent Seceretary of State John Cabot, and Ben Afflect plays our hero, CIA operative Jack Ryan. We've supposedly seen him before in Clear and Present Danger, but it was a different actor from a movie that has long since been forgotten since its release a decade ago, so there's not much of a sequel feel to it. This leads to the only real drawback of the movie: since we're expected to be familiar with these guys, there's virtually no development of the characters. I'm not criticizing the actors, but at the end of the movie I left knowing nothing about the characters other than their names, their job titles, and that they all shared a common goal of preventing the nation from being blown up. However, the story in which CIA analyst Jack Ryan tries to uncover a plot to bring Russia and the United States to the brink of nuclear war, more than makes up for the lack of characterization. It moves at an exciting pace, it is packed with plenty of action, and it has the same draw as TV shows like Alias, 24, The Agency, and West Wing, taking us behind the scenes of an important government agency which we otherwise wouldn't have access to. The difference here is that we know we're seeing something authentic because Tom Clancy does his homework. The story is bold and unpredictable but Affleck's character comes through in an exciting climax, where he has to give a persuasive speech to both his own president and the leader of Russia to avoid an all-out war. If you don't live in the Greater Baltimore Area, it's a happy ending! *** out of ****",The Sum of All Fears

But the film makers decision to reset Jack Ryan to the bumbling beginnings of his career has pretty much guaranteed that we will never see that now. And its a damn shame.

The tension is gradual and bone-chilling, and the climax is too much for words, specially in a time when terrorist attacks are so vivid on our minds. I won't go into details. I'll just say that this one is a winner all the way: Morgan Freeman provides a stable, professional sidekick, Ben Affleck is a perfect Jack Ryan (although I won't care to know how they change from Harrison Ford to a man so much younger), and the direction is accurate and with some interesting details.

Neo-nazi thugs get their hands on a nuclear weapon, and try to start a war between the US and Russia. CIA analyst Jack Ryan is played this time by Ben Affleck, and as I suspected when I first learned that he would take over the role from Harrison Ford, he is the weakest part of the film. I don't think that he is a bad actor, but he doesn't have that charisma to play a character like Jack Ryan, he is good in light dramas and comedies. He seems lost, going through the motions. Alec Baldwin was good, and Ford was a great Ryan, Affleck is not up to the task.

98,rollernerd,Poorly executed,5,29 April 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the political thriller The Sum of All Fears (2002), which is the reboot of Jack Ryan in the Ryanverse where we have Ben Affleck as the main protagonist. So we have a younger Jack Ryan who faces questions around his credibility where everyone keeps saying that he has no experience - a big 2000s 101 problem. This reboot feels like a mix of Red October with Clear and Present Danger and had the elements to surpass both flicks with the casting and story however the direction fails to capitalise on both. This time around we have a new President of Russia, a man whose politics are virtually unknown except to Ryan. This change in political leaders sparks paranoia among American CIA officials, so CIA Director Bill Cabot recruits young analyst Ryan. Cabot feels like two characters mixed with one. He is played by the voice of a higher authority, Morgan Freeman. So we have an amazing cast. The story? Very basic, a disgruntled ex-Nazi, who acquires a nuclear device in the Middle East and plans to instigate a war between the USA and Russia and then take over when the super powers destroy each other.The story sounds alright but the execution feels basic and poor. Why? Lets start with the bomb. The nuclear bomb at an American football game wasn't displayed great on a visual sense. Like did it explode there? What happened to the thousands of spectators? The stadium itself? Who was the poor spectator that accidently tripped the bomb? Were the spectators warned? So many gaps!!Now Affleck tries his best to make us forget Harrison Ford but doesn't live up to the role and to me it feels like the movie is to boost and attract more female quota due to his looks, which adds nothing tangible to the film and only detracts from the continuity that had been built to this point. For example there's a scene where Ryan's love interest is asked how ""cute"" Ryan is on a 1-10 scale, and she says a ""12"". Comonnnnnnn!!!! You include this garbage, yet skip vital character development later in the film? Poor. And the action sequences were poorly arranged and were missing key points such as Ryan getting caught in the nuclear blast yet hardly gets his hair mussed, how cliché!!! The final confrontation with the terrorists was poorly arranged and were very poorly developed character-wise. Even Baldwin had his own grounded version of the character which really pulled off as a smart, witty Navy officer who can hold his own. In this incarnation, you feel Affleck's version cannot be taken seriously.To me the actor who steals the movie and had little screen time is Ciaran Hinds who plays the Russian President. He plays the character with ease by showcasing wit, seriousness whilst someone who can actually lead a nation. Also props to Liev Schrieber as the new incarnation of Clark, a mysterious man with a past however the first scene between him and Ryan could have been built wayyyy better than what we were given.But overall what lets the flick down aren't the actors but the direction made by the filmmaker as a quick sloppy commercial flick rather than a smart intense political thriller. We have Dr Evil like villains, the pacing is bad for example one minute the bomb is still being constructed and a few minutes later its already placed in Baltimore and about to explode. Poor character development. A great pro is you have Seinfeld alum Mr Bookman, Phillip Baker Hall and Scrubs alum Bob Kelso and always a police dude or a political dude Bruce McGill sharing scenes as the advisors to the USA President.However, this brings something that ticked me off in the flick is the lack of female advisors and the stereotyping of how men are the key figures who make vital key decisions on a global scale. This is illustrated where we have a dinner early on the flick where the head of politics are in one massive function room, enjoying their time listening to the President's speech, until their emergency buzzers go off and leave their partners at dinner - which were all females just kicking it back seeing the men off to work. Cliched and stereotypical. Plus the plot holes among plot holes..i can keep going. Overall 5/10.",The Sum of All Fears

101,The_Wood,"Surprisingly, Affleck is perfect -- the film isn't. 7/10",7,31 May 2002,"The Sum of All Fears is your typical Tom Clancy movie: not terrible, but never anything more than average.  This is a fine popcorn film, with a couple of great performances.  Stand-outs include James Cromwell and Liev Schreiber, but the surprise comes from Affleck.  Affleck makes a much more likable and human Jack Ryan then Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin ever could. Action scenes are few and far between, but when they do pop-up, they entertain.  The film feels a tad overlong and the villain is not memorable.Overall I liked this film.  Nothing fantastic, no eye-popping action scenes and it's never as smart as Spy Game, but it delivers in the usual Clancy style.",The Sum of All Fears

There is so much going on (mostly nonsense) that the actors can get away with ""going through the motions"". Ben Affleck looks half asleep and...considering he has to save the world...it is not an inspiring condition to be in. Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Philip Baker Hall are wise old foxes. They know they can do these roles standing on their heads---look convincing----yet forget the name of the movie ! The patriotism shown in this type of American (aren't we great) film is always disgraceful. This review is not really complete. I fell asleep for 5 minutes. I am quite sure I missed nothing.

103,Darkjak007,Average,6,29 April 2021,"The sum of all fears is the prequel to the jack Ryan films that tells the beginnings of a young Jack Ryan's time in CIA as he has to try to prevent global crisis between the United States and Russia after Neo-Nazi steals a nuke in order to try to frame one another so that they can try to. Create a fascist superstate within Europe. Looking over all the Tom Clancy films next to shadow recruit this one tend to be overlooked and when you look at it you could see Why. It's characters or rather basic the protagonist is not the jack Ryan you know with a story is rather generic. The the biggest problem with this movie has to be Jack Ryan. This is a prequel to all the Ryan films Ben Affleck just doesn't capture that portrayal of Jack supposed to be like ahead and tell her to see a CIA agent before he worked his way up the ladder but it doesn't really show him really convey that. They try to go for more of an origin of him being more of a desk and agent in a field agent who started off which makes him less interesting even as he speaks you don't really buy that he actually knows what he's talking about like it kind of feels like he is just reading off a script. Alone it's probably not as bad if you see this is a standalone film. However It is rather hard to see Jack Ryan with Ben Affleck here when your aknowledge that this is supposed to be the same Ryan from The Hunt for red October, patriot games and a clear and present danger. Morgan Freeman gave a decent performance he plays very similar to James Earl Jones character James Greer but it has doesn't feel like he leaves as much as an impact. Liev Schreiber Make a small appearance as John clark but he doesn't have that many scenes. The plot say before it falls Nazis trying to launch and World War III situation between United States and Russia to form a new state to spread their influence across Europe how they really plan on doing that they tried explaining Propaganda has a virus and how it spreads to a much smaller world through technology. It sets the tone of the film doesn't really show anything like that happening. The action is decent specifically the stadium scene actually decent it's rather short. It's the first half of the movie where the movie really suffers we just spent a lot of time trying to set up everybody and build up to the event that it feels rather drawn out well the scenes with Morgan Freeman and Affleck are delivered well They feel rather off. One scene Ryan's on the phone with his girlfriend and he tells her he's in the CIA and then she just had a hangs up and he's like hello. There's quite of A bit of humor like, it doesn't take it so seriously until the possibility of nuclear warfare. This point it starts to feel more like it's called Tom Clancy films or cold war film in general. But at this point it escalated so quickly and feels rushed that it doesn't feel as satisfying.",The Sum of All Fears
104,basrutten,It's amazing to see...,4,30 July 2005,"...how such a great book could be turned into such an utterly mediocre movie. I recently read Tom Clancy's book on which this movie is based, an while the book is a bit unfocused, it still made for a great read. I rented the movie to see if they managed to turn it into a decent adaptation.Alas, it is not. The movie certainly is based on the book, but the story has been simplified and unnecessarily changed so much that what remains is a very, very weak extract of a great book. Whereas the book was very convincing and detailed, the movie version doesn't make an awful lot of sense, and changing the villains from Arab terrorists to Nazis is, while understandable in the wake of 9/11, very bad for the credibility. Tom Clancy says it himself on the DVD commentary: ""I'm the guy whose book you chose to ignore"".Like the book, the film takes a while to get going. The problem is that it never really gets up to speed. Throughout the entire running time, the pace is horribly slow, with endless shots of airplanes, boats, cars and other means of transportation that add absolutely nothing, and endlessly drawn out scenes, many of them consisting of dull melodrama. What could and should have been an exciting political thriller turned out to be more of a one-man show for Ben Affleck, that never gets even moderately suspenseful.There are a couple of action sequences, but they're few and far between, and they don't really add up to much, either: they're generally just some shots of aircraft shooting some missiles, and consequently something blows up. Wow. It's neither spectacular nor suspenseful.The movie's one saving grace is its excellent cast. Morgan Freeman and James Cromwell can obviously do much better than this, but they still deliver good performances. The supporting cast is generally good as well. Ben Affleck, however, is just plain horrible as the lead.""The Sum of all Fears"" turned out to be a huge disappointment for me. It has some good acting, but its slow pace, lack of excitement and terrible lead actor, combined with the fact that the makers mutilated the story it is based on, make it a movie that's mediocre at the very best ** out of *****",The Sum of All Fears

I had never saw this film until now cause I heard it wasn't great and sure enough it wasn't. It seemed like it should be good, but it just wasn't. Failed in so many ways: not enough development of the villains and their plans, not enough time spent searching for the bomb at the game, did not even show how the bomb went off, terrorists just hanging out at the docks, can't text message information, too much time showing non-central actors, etc. Etc.

106,HelloTexas11,"decent, flawed Clancy adaptation",6,17 January 2009,"There is a certain inanity to 'The Sum of All Fears' and it begins to grate after a while. It is Jack Ryan (portrayed here by Ben Affleck) constantly being seen by his government superiors as 'the boy who cried wolf.' Yes, this is a continuing aspect of the character, but it is WAY overdone here, to the point of absurdity. Ryan is belittled, ignored, disbelieved, lectured, and generally made to look like a fool. At one point, he actually has a member of the cabinet on the phone during a crisis in which Ryan has a crucial piece of the puzzle, and the guy hangs up on him! Please tell me our government isn't THAT stupid. The story basically is that a mischievous third party tries to provoke a war between Russia and the United States, and damn near succeeds when they acquire an old Israeli nuke that disappeared back in the 70's. They set it off in Baltimore and the US administration naturally suspects the Russians. The problem is, the film audience learns about the weapon very early on, and so Jack Ryan's uncovering of the truth, in bits and pieces, seems interminable. Between no one else in the government believing him and the agonizing amount of time it takes him to put two and two together, filmgoers may begin tearing their hair out. Ben Affleck resembles Alec Baldwin's Jack Ryan much more than Harrison Ford's. Despite the urgency of much of his dialogue, Affleck comes off a bit shallow, and at times seems more annoyed at things in general than worried about the possibility of a nuclear showdown. Like the whole thing is keeping him from ordering concert tickets or something. Morgan Freeman plays his boss at the CIA and he's good as always, and James Cromwell is quite believable as the US President. 'The Sum of All Fears' doesn't feel a part of the same world really as the other Tom Clancy films, even with the presence of old hands like Cromwell. The Ryan character is diminished too much, and there is no other presence in the film substantial enough to take his place. So we essentially have an ensemble piece about a horrific set of events with a lot of interesting things taking place and a number of characters dealing with them. Taken on those terms, 'The Sum of All Fears' is a decent thriller.",The Sum of All Fears
107,Hancock_the_Superb,"Interesting political thriller, no real flaws . . . but it came at a bad time for the American public **spoilers**",8,19 July 2002,"The main criticism of this film, by critics and mainstream viewers alike, is it's portrayal of terrorism.  Instead of the threat of fundamentalist Islamic groups (which, from what I understand, was true in the novel, though I've never read it), we're given a story about neo-Nazis plotting to start a nuclear war between Russia and the US.  Personally, I don't really mind this relatively minor point, and really, if September 11th hadn't happened just ten months ago, I doubt people would be making a big deal about this.  Perhaps the supposed unfaithfulness to the novel (again, I haven't read it) would draw the only criticism.    I liked this film.  It was suspenseful, and the action scenes (few as they were) were great, though, of course, flaws concerning the nuclear blast-resistant cellphones and such stand out; but I, at least, was too caught up in the exciting goings-on to notice.    The only other Clancy adaption I've seen is ""The Hunt For Red October"", which I liked, though I thought Sean Connery was a bit wooden (and if you think he can't act, look at ""The Untouchables"" or ""The Man Who Would Be King"").  ""The Sum of All Fears"", while hardly perfect, was just what I thought it would be: a taut, suspenseful flick about the threats of terrorism.  And in doing that, the filmmakers succeded.   The cast was, on the whole, pretty good, save Ben Affleck (who was okay but a bit corny) and Morgan Freeman (he didn't have much to work with and thusly didn't come across very well).  James Cromwell, as President Robert Fowler, was the most interesting and perhaps the most human character, and gets more screentime than you'd expect.  Liev Schieber was also good as a fellow CIA agent who saved Affleck's butt more than one time (and vice versa).  Also, Freeman's death scene was a bit stupid, but otherwise, no real complaints.   Eight stars.",The Sum of All Fears
108,Ziya90,The sum of all my fears,2,13 December 2009,"This movie is one of the most forgettable films of all time, at least the most forgettable thriller. In the forums, in almost all the cinema magazines, people say that Ben Affleck's acting is wooden, he is too straight faced and he is always the same in all his movies. I disagree. He is not a great actor yes, but not that much. They exaggerate. Therefore, the problem of the movie is neither Ben Affleck, nor Morgan Freeman, it is the movie itself. By the way, it is too painful that its rating is much more higher than some very good action thriller movies, especially made in 1990s. The movie is an action movie which includes almost no action. This is the first fear. I had started to watch the film by the hope of seeing an exciting, action thriller movie like Mission Impossible movies, for example but all I got was a too slow paced movie. No car chase, no pursuit, no gunfight. There is an explosion scene, but even it is not remarkable at all, because we cannot see the explosion, wee see the events after that. The rest of the movie is conversations, phone conversations and conversations again. Additionally, the movie is not stylish, 'normal'. Another fear. As said, this is not a remarkable movie, no prominent scene! My third fear. The movie is not enjoyable at all, from the first minute till the last, even that off screen explosion scene. You know, there are some movies, not good movies, but real enjoyable. This movie is not one of them. The third fear. The Sum of All The Fears.",The Sum of All Fears

I am a little biased towards giving this movie a vote of ""10"" because ""...October"" is one of my favorite of all time.

111,lotus_chief,This film was disappointing (Spoilers inside!),4,2 June 2002,"Due to my love of political, complex stories, I was naturally drawn to this film. After seeing the preview, I was hooked. But after finally seeing the film last night, numerous things disappointed me:The best parts of the movie were in the preview! Now I know that in order to get the public to see the film, the preview must be appealing. But one would hope that there are more exciting things in the film BESIDES what's shown in the preview. There are none!Morgan Freeman's character dies! To kill off the best actor in the cast was just horrible. Freeman basically held the movie together when half the audience was on the verge of sleeping during the first 1 hour of this film, due to its REALLY slow start. He was the most entertaining aspect of the film while he was in it. His character dying was VERY disappointing...especially seeing that I saw this film for him!Why didn't the nuclear bomb explode when the Israeli plane was shot down? Then to be found 'buried' in the ground as if the plane crashed instead of the exploded was just illogical. Also, why did it take 30 YEARS for it to be found without ANY inquiries from Israel in that long period of time?Was I the only one who thought that Ryan's girlfriend was the one we saw getting basically BLOWN away by the nuclear blast at the Baltimore hospital?Seeing her still alive really confused me, and the whole thing in the end with Ryan and her at a picnic and everything be happy-go-lucky with them was the EPITOME of cheezy!!Ben Affleck is nothing special in this film. Now this really didn't surprise me, as I'm not a fan of Affleck and I basically went to see the film to support Freeman, who's one of my favorite actors. Affleck is in no way convincing in this role. The Sum of All Fears had the potential of being great; with such a good cast (the majority of the actors playing political figures are known to play such roles and don't disappoint) and the subject matter...this could've been a much better film. But with all of the plot holes, illogical action sequences, and a script full of clichés...it ultimately doesn't deliver.",The Sum of All Fears

It's just impossible to accept that this skinny 20-something pretty boy knows more about geopolitics than the president and all his advisors. Al Pacino was miscast in Godfather1 and did a great job, but in general it doesn't work to cast a young pretty face as a tough guy.SPOILER - Best part of the movie was when the nuke went off. The scene was cast in a football stadium so i expected a tactical nuke that would take out the stadium but no--- they blowed up all of baltimore! Worst part of the movie were the worthless love scenes between ben and his girlfriend.Morgan Freeman has a big part as a presidential adviser and as usual, dominates every scene he is in.

The worse atrocity was replacing Muslim Arab terrorists in the novel(who could imagine that?) with a composite phony crew of Russian Nazis(uh huh, why not German Nazis or Russian Communists, the real Nazis had no great love for Slavs). This is a good example of the phonies in Hollywood trying to bury Islamic terrorism by pretending everyone but Muslims are terrorists.Other than that, the film was boring and unreal, Baltimore is leveled, yet a car crash on the local news has more depth. It was the same warmed over stuff that any procedural nuke flick like ""The Fourth Protocol"" or the ""The Peacemaker"" offered up much better. If you can see it for free, go ahead, it's not horrible, but don't spend a nickel or go ten feet out of your way for this one.",The Sum of All Fears
114,fredericksmith1952,"The fourth Tom Clancy novel to make it to the big screen, and the third actor to play Jack Ryan.",7,27 May 2012,"The fourth Tom Clancy novel to make it to the big screen, and the third actor to play Jack Ryan. This film falls short of expectations for several reasons. Since it is shot as a ""prequel""of sorts to the previous films, Sum of all Fears seems somehow out of time with its predecessors. In this film, Jack Ryan is played by Ben Affleck, who is certainly no slouch in front of the camera. His portrayal of the the Clancy hero is good, and even meshes with the performance of Alec Baldwin in the first film of the series, Hunt for Red October. I guess my problem is Red October post dates Sum by a number of years, since in it Catherine and Jack are married with a daughter, yet the Soviets are still around. In Sum, Ryan and Cathy are still dating, only becoming engaged at the end of the film and the Soviet Union is long gone. From that standpoint alone, the timing is off sequence, which can make for a bit of a conflict for those of us who have read Clancy's novels, or seen the previous films. For the uninitiated, the film is terrific, and opens up the possibility of an entire new series (which was never pursued, apparently). Cromwell and Freeman are striking in their roles, as is Ciaran Hinds as the Russian President. The remaining cast, McGill, et. al., are intense when they need to be and absent when not needed. Which is the problem with a film like this, since you have so much action going on it is easy to get lost in it. Rated PG-13 for violence and language, the terrifying scene of a nuclear weapon going off in a crowded city is enough for all of us to consider whether or not to let the kids watch. Definitely not collectible, since the series was never continued and the film is out of sequence with the first three Clancy films. Rent it, don't buy it.",The Sum of All Fears

Ben Affleck is an entirely credible Jack Ryan as a young man and the rest of the cast could hardly have been better. While some suspension of disbelief is, of course, required, after all, this is a thriller, the plot hangs together nicely.

This single sentence could give you the main idea of what the Sum of all Fears is. It's all about what would happen if either Russia or America took a leap of faith and act unconsciously. Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman star in the film that tells the story of this dilemma. It is Ben Affleck's role to prove the American Presidential commit, that Russia isn't guilty, as well as tell Russia the same about the Americans. This fight becomes even stronger by the time when the outcome of the tension finally happens.This outcome I was writing about is one of the most impressive sequences that came to our movie screens lately, it is a truly impressive sequence. It is actually impressive how this movie fulfilled it's obligations; when the chances of being an enormous failure were enormous. When we see the Sum of all Fears we can see some common plot points with the Peacemaker, another great movie: Terrorism. Remarkable are specially the cinematography, Ben Affleck; the always trustable Morgan Freeman and the rest of the top notch cast. Also, notice the irony: in Deep Impact, Morgan Freeman as the president, had James Cromwell working with him under disastrous situations.

120,DanB-4,A Good Film Made Better by Its Timeliness,8,28 July 2002,"Five years ago, you would leave this film saying ""this could happen"". Today, in the post 9/11 world, you leave this film saying ""when will this happen.""The movie follows Jack Ryan, now played by Ben Affleck as a young low level CIA operative on the trail of a missing nuclear weapon. Where is it, who has it, where are they sending it. The clock is ticking, you as a viewer know without a doubt that the bomb will go off, but this skillfully crafted film still packs great suspense and intrigue. The Sum of All Fears points out all to clearly that our free society is vulnerable. Changing the villains from Arab terrorists in the book to right-wing extremists in the film may have been an political correctness move, but it undoubtedly adds to the film. Think about it, is not a threat from a group of American born citizens scarier? We are dealing in this movie with a villain who believes that Hitler was ""not crazy, just stupid.""There is a parade of veteran character actors, all giving great performances as high ranking government officials. There are numerous speaking roles, and a wonderfully assembled timeline without once being crowded or confusing. From the opening sequence, which flashes back 30 years to explain the origins of the bomb, to conclusion, The Sum of All Fears combines action and special effect with the exact dosage or paranoia to make a great film. It plays with our fears of another horrible domestic terrorist attack, but does not exploit them.The relationship between Ryan and his girlfriend could have and should have been cut. The girlfriend wades through the checklist of female companion plot devices from start to finish and adds nothing to the film.Pay close attention to how the film is cut and how the director neatly unfolds the plot lines (the construction of the bomb, its value as a simple commodity on the black market, the American/Russian politics, the search for the terrorists and the plot of the extremists) all to one point - the detonation - and then scrambles everything into chaos.
I did not like the ending of this film - the final scene not the conclusion of the plot. It is a little too sugar coated when you remember that at least 100,000 people were likely killed.It is hard to say how well this movie would play in a different world.

Unfortunately, because of a plot change from the original source material (Middle East conflicts in the book; neo-Nazis in the movie), I believe it muted the story's effectiveness. Adapting books to film has always been and always will be a risk.

122,eastbergholt2002,Well Made Thriller,8,10 March 2007,"Sum of All Fears is an enjoyable thriller and the type of movie the Hollywood studios have always been good at making. It's slick, expensive-looking, well-acted and two hours of far-fetched fun. Ben Affleck plays CIA Agent and superman Jack Ryan PhD. Ryan is a former marine, linguist and all-round polymath who saves the world from impending disaster. Affleck is youthful and convincing as Ryan and makes him seem fallible and likable. Ryan becomes a confidant of the wise and sensible CIA Director Bill Cabot (Morgan Freeman) and acquires a beautiful and successful girlfriend (Bridget Moynahan) who believes he's a historian. The plot is complicated and involves a new Russian leader (Ciaran Hands) who spouts anti-U.S. rhetoric. A Russian chemical attack on Chechnya increases the tension between the two countries. An Israeli atomic bomb is found in the Egyption desert,a relic of the 1973 Arab-Israeli conflict. Neo-Nazi terrorists (led by Alan Bates) want to provoke a nuclear conflict between America and Russia. They acquire the bomb from a South African arms dealer and explode it in Baltimore. The U.S. blames the Russians and the two countries are about to commence all-out nuclear war until Ryan works out what is happening and it all ends happily. The message is that the new Russian leaders are reasonable men signifying that the world has moved on from the Commie bashing flicks of the 1980s.The idea of a terrorist nuclear attack is topical, but unfortunately the Neo-Nazi villains seem very 1970s. The film has good character actors in supporting roles (e.g., Liev Schrieber, James Cromwell). I much prefer Afflek's Ryan to that of the 52 year-old Harrison Ford who by 1994's Clear and Present Danger seemed too old and surly for the role.",The Sum of All Fears

I'm not sure it totally works but it's watchable stuff. But what definitely didn't work for me was Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, he's good-looking, he's likable but he's no Harrison Ford, he hasn't got the charisma to play a role like that, unlike Matt Damon who is excellent as Jason Bourne.

126,chthon2,Not Worth It,5,4 March 2003,"I'm sure most of you here already know the general plot line of this film, so I won't go into re-summarizing it for you and go straight to reviewing.First, we are hit by the continuity mistakes.  Jack Ryan is suddenly younger and doesn't have a family.  Then we have the US and Russia coming to confrontation?  I'm sorry, I like most of Tom Clancy's work, but this is just silly.  What decade does he think this is?  The Cold War is over.  We won.  Get over it and quit living in fear of being nuked.Morgan Freeman was alright, and he was the only one of the good actors in this film that wasn't underused.Affleck is another story.  He's not a bad actor, but he's not good, either. He's one of those 'personalities', a real celebrity; he comes off much better in interviews.  There's a certain quality a person has in their face when expressing emotion, and you can always tell when someone is bull sh*tting you.  Affleck had that 'fake' quality in his performance here.  I didn't really believe it.  I also didn't believe that he could run across town after it was nuked and not be affected by fallout, or that the US government would let a rookie CIA agent mediate between our President and the President of a large, powerful nation we were on the verge of war with.I was a bit disappointed by both the film and the book.  And I noticed, even when they tried to tone down the ethnic stereotypes for the movie that were in the book, the Arabs here are still portrayed as dirty, rural bumpkins.

The plot was, I think, unbelievable, character development was little to non existent, dialogue was thin, other elements seemed cliched or uninspired. However, Morgan Freeman turns in his usual solid performance (though its gett'n a bit stale) and there were a few interesting scenes, like the bomb blast, which drew gasps from all in the audience.

It doesn't fit but who cares. The non-stop action and excitement is more than enough to make you forget all that. The story takes us all around the world, but it starts in Syria where diggers find an old Israeli nuke and sell it unknowingly to a Neo-Nazi who uses it to trigger nuclear warfare between the United States and Russia, who are in the midst of nuclear tensions already. It's up to Jack Ryan to stop the power hungry leaders from sparking World War III and possibly destroying the world itself. Morgan Freeman and the fine as hell Bridget Moynahan also have great performances and Director Phil Alden Robinson does a excellent job.

Anyways, some time back in the 70's a plane went down that was carrying a nuclear bomb, but the bomb never exploded. After so so many years it was found in the rubble in Israel. That bomb was then sold to a secret Nazi militia that wish to put Russia and America to war against each other. In comes in DCI Cabot, who takes Jack Ryan with him to Russia to inspect their nuclear bombs, but get suspicious when a few scientists are missing. As they return the President of USA heads for Baltimore to see a football game, but Ryan discovers a nuclear bomb is going to blow up there at the stadium.Extremely pointless and boring movie, I thought every Nazi plot thing was over and done with. The only person in the movie that seemed to know what he was doing was the undercover agent John Clark (Liev Schreiber) other than that, the movie was bad.

136,Critical Eye UK,Sum of All Nothings,1,17 December 2006,"Deservedly derided on release, The Sum of All Fears continues to hold a heady place in the worst-movies-ever league.It's not only a mess, but a repugnant mess, as ludicrous as it is loathsome in its pandering to that section of the audience which belongs to the moronic tendency, one which only wakes up to death-as-reality rather than death-as-entertainment when confronted by events like 9/11 and which hasn't a clue about politics, history, geography, or much of anything else.Like the execrable Die Hard II, which for narrative purposes dispensed with several hundred lives in the destruction of a 747  Lockerbie, anyone?  Sum of All Fears goes in for mass murder  but then, like Die Hard, fudges it. It's just a fiction, folks. Entertainment, right? We didn't really mean it.And no, of course they didn't. It would be difficult, putting it mildly, to have any serious intent when dramatising anything from Tom Clancy's latter-day output: source material bearing only an accidental approximation to the English language makes life hell for those lumbered with the task of turning it into a screenplay.With Paul Atanassio in the writing credits, however, more, much more, might reasonably have been expected. But neither he nor anyone else involved delivers, well. . . anything.Narratively, it's a string of clichés that aren't even pulled together: neo-Nazis (oh Gawd, spare us, do) with a nuclear bomb (heigh-ho) and somewhere, some rogue Russian general who blows up the most unprepared aircraft carrier in the history of warfare after the Nazis have blown up, er, Baltimore.Not that anyone notices that Baltimore is the new Nagasaki. People merrily wander around Ground Zero without thought or effect of radioactive fall-out. The biggest danger appears to be fire engines driven by Keystone Cops.Tackling the neo-Nazis is an actor who achieves the not inconsiderable feat of registering even less on the radar than a stealth bomber. He, whatever his name is, escapes Baltimore in much the same way that his presence escapes the entire movie.Morgan Freeman is somewhere in there too, but it's a phoned-in performance -- as is that of Alan Bates, who on reflection may afterwards have thought himself fortunate to have worn so much make-up.The US military is there in support as well, thereby proving to the rest of the world how utterly illiterate it truly is -- else how come it signed up to a script which shows it to be so blindingly maladroit? (If there's such a thing as reincarnation, God, please don't bring me back as a midshipman on a US aircraft carrier. . .) James Cromwell turns up too, seemingly in confirmation that either he or his agent can't read, either: the tastelessness of ""The General's Daughter"" ought to have been enough for one career but no, here he is again. Curious, how far the farmer has travelled from the happy days of 'Babe'.But perhaps that's the explanation. Somebody said of ""The Sum of All Fears"" that it's a real pig of a script.So he thought he was in another sequel.Rating: doesn't even register.",The Sum of All Fears
137,JesNollie,Jack Ryan is back,7,2 June 2002,"This movie starts off a little slow, but when it punches, it punches hard and on some nerves still raw from recent real life events.  This may be the reason that although the story is frighteningly plausible, many details are ignored, most notably the aftermath.  Ben Affleck does a respectable job as a young Jack Ryan just getting his feet wet in the CIA, and I look forward to his next film in this role.  The romance seemed out of place and IMO should have been toned down, or eliminated.  Liev Schrieber is wonderful and steals every scene he's in (he would have made an even better young Jack Ryan).",The Sum of All Fears
138,parhat,Weak Plots and Murder Godfather Style,3,8 January 2005,"The story is simple enough, get Russia and U.S. into a raving frenzy and kill each other while the third party watch from behind. The problem about the third party plot which stands enough to benefit from U.S. and Russia killing each other just doesn't add up in the movie, since we do not know how the third party stand to benefit anything.Most wars are actually created to benefit the larger richer nations for some economic benefit, either oil companies, gain of control of land, lots of gold, oil, etc. In this case it is pure hostility plain and simple. Take for instance U.S. takeover of Iraq, with Saddam out of the way, the oil are no longer selling in Eurodollars, that would straighten U.S. dollars. With Taliban out of the way in Afghanistan, the oil pipeline deal was much easily built without paying anything to the Taliban (court case on payment is still pending in Texas). With the E. Timor being an independent nation from Indonesia, oil concessions now belong to the U.S., I can go on and on. But for a Third party to stand to benefit is a weak plot - now you really have to convince me on that. I am not that smart. If the writers are determined to go this direction, then convince me why they are doing what they do. Hitler's dead, so what's the deal for the Neo-Nazis? If Russia, or U.S. have some kind of an economic benefit unbeknownst to the public, the story would be more believable. Even the ending of the movie was somewhat hilarious for me as it really reminded me of Godfather Part II. I would die laughing (thank god they didn't do that) if they shot a gun through the eye while in the massage parlor. But hey, car bomb explosion Godfather style was funny already. I mean a tyrannical crime of this size, I think should be decided by world court or something for the public to see, not Al Pacino style murder.Even the idea of putting bombs in a stadium was truly not a creative act of terrorism - reminds me of Bruce Willis' Boy Scout. Now, most terrorism are quite creative, grant you the anthrax mail or hitting commercial airlines on World Trade Center. These things are totally unexpected, which is how acts of terrorism exists.And looking back at Tsunamis, an act of terrorism in creating tsunami's is in my book would be quite creative. Imagine a line of fault under the water of Marianne Island off the Atlantic Ocean, using a conventional cheap underwater missile or underwater detonation to trigger the most massive Tsunamis in the history of mankind causing 500 foot waves traveling at near speed of sound hitting and destroying the entire eastern Coast of U.S.A. destroying totally Washington D.C, New York, etc. Could it be, in a movie that this act of terrorism is already being done using a conventional bomb under the water in S.E. Asia? Destroying an economy is easy, and the fact that there is a possibility that S.E. Asia has the world's largest oil reserve (at least that's what I've heard) from South of Asia all the way to Brunei, is something a movie can look at, from an a Hollywood point of view. I am not promoting any conspiracy theories here.Sorry to nit pick, perhaps I am not smart as most of the critics who watched this movie and for this I apologize. I rate this movie 3/10. If you want a more believable movie I recommend the classic Dr. Strangelove. It is funny, and the scenarios and the plots are quite solid and I rate that movie 9/10.",The Sum of All Fears
139,RolloTomasi,A good movie anyway,7,7 November 2002,"Desperate to make this film at any cost, they tailored a book published in 1991 about hostilities between the USA and Russia to fit today's political climate. I did not buy into the level of hostility between the two nations in 2002. Watching this film you can sense all the cutting and pasting that's going on. The nuclear blast in Baltimore is reduced in size to a ""low grade nuclear device."" The Cold War is replaced by tensions over Chechnya.What ""Sum"" does do well is illustrate the panic and confusion that follows the explosion. The arguing among the president's advisors rang true. They'd be angry, overly emotional, irrational, and looking for a culprit, someone to strike back at. My question is, why neo-Nazis? Robinson and his writers are smart enough to use real issues like Russia's oppression of Chechnya and yet have to resort to cartoon villains to create the right circumstances. The nazis' desire is to rise up as a world power, to win in days what they failed to win in WWII. They want to take over the world. Well, Dr. Evil wants to take over the world. Those adapting Tom Clancy's book needed to think smaller-keeping the terrorists exclusively Chechen would have made more sense. Russia has been beating them down for more than a century now. I could have taken the film much more seriously if they'd limited the terrorists' ambitions to destroying Russia at any expense of human life. All that being said, ""Sum of All Fears"" does end up being a good film. I was pleased that, in spirit anyway, Robinson and company stayed true to the tone of the other 3 Clancy-adapted films. I'd rank it at number 3 out of the 4, ""October"" being at the top and ""Present Danger"" a close second.

141,MRavenwood,"Watchable, but with Torpid Pacing",5,15 February 2008,"I'm not a Ben Affleck fan, but I don't hate him either. He's just colorless, which is kind of how the Jack Ryan character is written, but that's not my cinematic problem to fix: it's the writer an director's job to make it work.The rest of the cast is an enviable crowd of who's-who in supporting actors and character people of Oscar calibre. So, with an interesting plot concept concerning alleged post-Cold War trickery from Russia, one has to ponder the culprit for such a slow film. I found the editing weak and therefore the director probably takes the blame for how un-thrilling this film is.For those of you not in-the-know, Jack Ryan is a (spy/military ops writer) Tom Clancy character. He is an anti-Bond style character who is, ostensibly, not anxious to meet the bad guy or involve himself in the action. He nevertheless seems to find himself in it. What is rather annoying about this film is that Ryan stumbles conveniently into everything and has more than 9 lives. So why even bother making him an anti-Bond character?There are also laughably unrealistic scenes involving The President and his cabinet shouting at each other in a totally overly dramatized way that rings hollow both culturally and technically in view of the crisis. The lack of grittiness, authenticity, and energy that fuels this kind of film, just causes the whole vehicle to flop right off the rails. Having said that, the visual effects are very good with lots of pyro work and in particular, a sequence involving an aircraft carrier is a deft combination of ""live"" elements and computer generated enhancements. The third act is hard to follow and a culminates in a tedious, preachy little wrap-up that tries to be cute and ends up being about as fresh as a Murder She Wrote plot. But you might fall asleep before that, so don't worry too much about it.",The Sum of All Fears
142,TimBoHannon,A Formula for Failure Becomes a Rousing Success,9,6 December 2008,"When I first heard that Ben Affleck was cast to play Jack Ryan, I shook my head. I have never been a fan of Affleck or his normally lackluster acting, and ""Clear and Present Danger"" is a sorely lacking movie. Using that movie as a template, I went into ""The Sum of All Fears"" expecting an action flick with Ryan author Tom Clancy's usual political subplots. Instead, I saw and heard something much more. ""The Sum of All Fears"" is a thought provoking work of art that is more than worth my money. What I saw was one of those rare films that grab your mind and keeps you thinking long after the credits roll.On the surface, this film could have been a monster failure. It relies less on action than the previous two Ryan films, and involves more politics and emotional drama. Furthermore, incumbent Harrison Ford turned down the offer to reprise his role as the protagonist, so Ben Affleck earned the part. Drama plus Affleck should equal a bad combination, but in this case that equation does not balance.I sometimes wonder if Ben Affleck played hooky in acting class, but, for the first time, I saw him produce a convincing character. No longer is he stone faced and monotonous, but he finally puts some expression into a role. Perhaps it was the script, which was well written and executed by all parties. Maybe it was the director, who brilliantly mixed the ingredients together to bring out a powerful final dish. In any case, we now know that he can be a convincing and likable actor.Morgan Freeman and James Cromwell are my two favorite actors. In fact, my admiration for them is at the same level as Roger Ebert's towards Harry Dean Stanton and M. Emmet Walsh. This movie is their second appearance together, the first being ""Deep Impact,"" a movie which should be ejected into space. Cromwell brings his usual sharpness to the table, literally and otherwise. Freeman shows up with his usual ""Morgan Freeman"" performance, and few compliments are higher.The story begins with the finding of an Israeli nuclear bomb that was lost in 1973. The plutonium is sold on the black market to a European terrorist group bent on sending America and Russia on a collision course for nuclear war. The leaders of both nations are portrayed as peaceful, intelligent individuals agonizing over the decisions they are faced with. Opposite Cromwell is President Nemerov of Russia (Ciarán Hinds). The interplay between the two is always intriguing. Each desires to trust the other but fears making a critical mistake. Neither wants a war, but they need to defend their people. This is where Ryan, armed with priceless information, comes in.There are also some notable differences between the novel and the movie, such as the affiliation of the terrorists. It is also a prequel to the other Ryan films, a decision that was made when the 30 year-old Affleck was cast. Bridget Moynahan plays the future Cathy Ryan, and manages to be convincing. Her character is laid back, but as a doctor and natural leader she needs to remain perfectly calm. Some may find her personality underwhelming, but with knockout looks like hers it is easy to fall in love with Ryan's girlfriend.As my final point, I would like to give my most sincere compliments to director Phil Alden Robinson, who adds a lot to the film with his use of colors and shadows. He also lends visual symbolism to the worldwide impact of the story with many aerial shots. The special effects are astounding and disturbing. This is all augmented by the best soundtrack of eighteen time Oscar nominee Jerry Goldsmith's career. The action scenes are few and spaced apart, but that factor is immaterial. ""The Sum of All Fears"" is thought rousing drama that stands as the best Jack Ryan movie. Kudos to everyone involved in the making of this gem.",The Sum of All Fears
143,jillbeckinheim7,Not as good as the Ford films,5,4 November 2021,"Not as good as the Ford films. This isn't quite a disaster of a film. It has some neat movie-making moments, like the way they recreate the high secrecy of the Defense Department, or the brief atomic bomb sequences. Morgan Freeman seems to be convincing as anything he wants to be in film, and he is a central high point again and again. In fact, the movie takes off when he first appears, and it disintegrates when his role is done. Liev Schrieber can be wonderful and he's strong here, but isn't given enough rope to make his character have distinction.Taking all this further, I think it is at times an insulting movie, making schlock out of the most fearsome and serious of 20th Century issues. You also invariably remember the great Cold War films straight out of the cold war, like ""Fail-Safe"" and ""The Bedford Incident"" among several others, all of which have the horror and terrifying lack of control intact. And of course to bring out the Nazis again (as so many films do, I guess because we have a cultural hatred of them that's still draws water at the well) is just too much. Not that they don't exist, but that they don't contribute here.",The Sum of All Fears

It is based on a novel by Tom Clancy and features the famous character Jack Ryan who was originally played by Harrison Ford in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, and Alec Baldwin in The Hunt for Red October. Now, Ben Affleck takes on the serious role of the famous CIA agent who will stop at nothing until the terrorists are finished off.After discovering a nuclear missle buried in the sand in Israel, a powerful Ukranian terrorist buys it from a village and plans to use its power to create a much more powerful nuclear weapon and use it against the United States in order to make Russia and America enemies with each other. The plot is formed so that the bomb can go off at a football game in Baltimore. When CIA agent Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) discovers the plot and the threat towards Americans, he does everything in his power to hunt down the terrorists before they cause destruction of the United States and Russia.I thought that this movie was really intense but at the same time, very interesting and mesmerizing.

Amongst all the concern about whether Ben Affleck could effectively replace Harrison Ford and renew this tiring franchise, the filmmakers seem to have forgotten that the best pick-me-up would have been a decent script.  This one's awful.  We know from the outset precisely what's going to happen, and when it does - after an interminable hour of preamble - it's virtually a non-event: the nuclear explosion which takes out Baltimore is realized with about as much visual flair as a White House press conference.  Worse, the series of events it initiates rapidly mushrooms into ludicrousness - thanks to ham-fisted, telemovie plotting - and interest is quickly lost.  The direction is patchy, Goldsmith's music is typically dire, and the performances are lukewarm at best.  Sure, Affleck's a nice enough substitute Ryan, but there's no getting around it: bucket-loads of boyish charm are no match for the fatherly, patriotic gravitas of Ford.",The Sum of All Fears

It was tedious, boring and, amazingly, full of bad language, unlike its predecessor movies. In short, it stank.

151,hypersonic8999,Quite good film,8,26 January 2012,"Well, the film wasn't as bad as people say, it was actually entertaining and kept me going for the 2 hours I watched it. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how bad or good an adaptation it was as other people say. I'll say this: Surely a film adapting a book will nearly always be bad because: a) They film has 90-120 minutes to develop plot, characters etc, while the book has all the pages it needs b) We are always expecting much more from a film adapted from a book we read c) The director/screenwriter will take the book on a different take, and that's the point of an adaptation. An adaptation is a different version of the pre-existing story. It takes an idea and develops it in a different way. I am always disappointed when I see film adaptations of books following the books to the letter, because it's just like reading a book for a second time. If you want to read the book a second time then do it. I myself will not pay a ticket or rent a DVD just to see what I have already read once or twice.I liked the fact that the bad guys were actually Neo-Nazis instead of Arab terrorists. Nazis are as much a cliché as Arab Terrorists being the villains, but instead the film reminds us that not all Arabs are evil, and certainly not to forget the legacy that fascism has left the world, and that the movement of neo-Nazis and extremist nationalism is indeed frightening and at the rise. It serves to remind people that evil can come from anywhere if we let it space to grow.The characters admittedly are not built enough in the film, but the situation is actually quite realistic. I liked the fact that the American and Russian presidents' cabinets had both warmongers and peace-lovers. Bureacracy almost got in the way of preventing a nuclear holocaust. There were people willing to sell their countries and the future of mankind for a few dollars more. That some people, although traditionally enemies, were working together to safeguard the world. It both gives faith to governments but also brings the viewer to criticize them.",The Sum of All Fears

The bomb in the book is a multistage thermonuclear bomb, not a fissile weapon. SO WHAT? This is a MOVIE!

This movie has that in spades.  Laughable bad-guys make laughable good-guys do ridiculous things in an attempt to build to a nuclear armageddon climax.  Along the way, every so often somebody mouths some rockheaded thing, presumably the writer, director, actor or producer's political feelings.  Just be aware that the world doesn't actually work like this, most particularly the world's nuclear arsenals.   The only acting  bright spot is Liev Schreiber, solid as always, but even he cannot save this turkey from Ben (Morgan Freeman is fine, of course, but mostly he just stands around looking alarmed.)

Certain scenes in this movie brought back some of those same eerie, tense moments. There was no point where I was wincing at glaringly obvious CG.Although there are a very few bumpy spots, this ride is worth taking.Although Ben Affleck would NOT have been my choice as Jack Ryan, he still puts out a credible performance. Unfortunately, like many current actors, he tends to react more than act, but hey, we're starting to get used to this in today's movies.The story ramps up smoothly enough, accelerating to full speed quickly. We are privy to all three sides of the conflict, and it is paced very well.The theater I saw this in was packed completely full, and yet at the quiet scenes (powerful dramatic silence, actually) there wasn't a word, cough, rustle or movement. It grabs you that hard.This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, it was believable and intense. It makes you think... it could happen, right?

155,wilsr,Another Clancy disappointment,1,19 June 2010,"Others have pointed out - and I am fully aware of the fact - that a movie ""based on.."" need have little in common with the book. This is certainly very much the case in ""The sum of all fears"". In spades.As a great fan of Clancy's books (well, the early ones anyway: the co-authored ones and his later titles could have been written by someone else), I appreciate the interwoven, complex subplots, the technical detail, the characterisations and the scene settings. Difficult to compress into a film but not impossible. Unfortunately, none of the Clancy movies so far has come close to doing justice to its original story.Where to start? Well, the casting is pretty dire. Affleck is just plain wrong as Ryan, and not only because he's not Harrison Ford. He just doesn't *look* right in the part. Neither does Schreiber act or look the part of Clancy's Clark. The US President is adequately depicted by James Cromwell and Freeman is, as always, good. But the rest of the cast, I am afraid, are once again just plain wrong.There are several scenes that are more reminiscent of a James Bond, tongue-in-cheek comedy drama than a story of this kind: again, just downright *wrong*. Nothing to do with misinterpretation of Clancy's subtleties, more to do with poor screenplay development.In fact, poor screen writing is the hallmark of this movie: the plot, as developed, almost relies on the viewers' knowledge of Clancy's novel in order to make head or tail of what's going on even as it abandons any semblance to it. It's an odd feeling, having at the back of one's mind how the plot was originally written while at the same time watching, on screen, something entirely different - and yet superficially the same. Frankly, without having read the original I would be pushed to follow what on earth was happening, the plotting is so haphazard and disjointed. It's almost like watching a series of cameos that bear little relation to one another.I wish I could say something positive about this movie, but I can't. Clancy's fans have been waiting in vain for a film of his novels that would do something like justice to them, and ""Sum"" is probably the biggest disappointment. Red October made a pretty fair hand at the task, Patriot Games too. The common factor - Harrison Ford. Yet even Ford couldn't really rescue ""Clear and present danger"" from an oversimplified interpretation of the book and he couldn't have saved this one either.Come on, Clancy: let's see you get together with a first class scriptwriter and make movies of your books that does something like justice to them.",The Sum of All Fears
156,amraampk,no sum of all failures,8,26 June 2008,"This movie has been given quite a few negative reviews but i don't fit in accordance of such opinions. movie is quite gripping from the start and impressed a lot to me. May choosing ben affleck as jack ryan is not a decision but apart from this the film contained a lot of events regarding war , terrorism, espionage and spy games. The plot deals with on growing threat of strain relationship of governments and emergence of terrorist leaders who just want to take advantage of on going sensitive situations. Morgan freeman at least played good part to his character , he completely did justice with his roll , James Cromwell was good as American president and cairan hinds was impressive as Russian president. Even after the detonation of nuclear bomb ,ben affleck become very emotionally active and charged into the movie, there was now some power in his character. the movie isn't bad any way whatever someone may think, there wasn't any time no any suspense and Adrenalin was found in the story.

157,nealklein,Wasted opportunity,6,19 June 2002,"There was a time when Tom Clancy was synonymous with ""well researched techno-thriller"". The adaptations of his books grew steadily less faithful with each sequel, but we could forgive this because the movies were at least somewhat well made.After September 11, 2001, a techno-thriller centered around nuclear terrorism has the potential to truly frighten an audience. Had the book been even slightly adapted, the resulting story could have been one for the record books without being bloated. But those adapting the screenplay wimped out and identified neo-Nazis as the villains instead of capitalizing on the climate of the world now. For those reading this review who have seen this movie, imagine what the story would have been like if the U.S. was convinced it was Al Qaeda and not a shadow extremist group secretly backed by an unlikely Islamic government who was *really* responsible for the plot. Might such a tale not have served as a warning to contemporary leaders and their populations as to how carefully they need to move in this post 9/11 world? And would the story not have had a more chilling message? As it stands in its current form, TSOAF feels more like a story in an alternate reality. For that reason alone, it loses most of its punch.While some might disagree with my opinion, I think Ben Affleck as well as the rest of the casting was almost inspired. Affleck has got to be one of the more underrated stars in the Hollywood population, and the rest of the cast flesh out the story palatably. (Okay, so he has an ego problem. So what?) Going with a younger Jack Ryan was *not* a mistake any more than going with Liev Schreiber as John Clark. And who wrote their lines? Very funny stuff.The movie looks real enough, but it has glaring and inexcusable plot holes.
SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD!
Clancy was meticulous when he wrote this novel a decade ago. He went into painstaking detail on how to and how *not* to make a nuclear bomb. He even deliberately made a few subtle errors in his writing to avoid discussing classified or even unclassified nuclear weapons information to protect national security. So it is ridiculous for any story based on Clancy's writings to omit the effects of an electro-magnetic pulse or even the consequences to those poor souls caught in a bomb's blast radius. I could not watch the film from that point and take it seriously after those gaffes were made.Do see ""The Sum of All Fears"" but remember, this is not your dad's Tom Clancy.",The Sum of All Fears
158,John K.-2,Anyone want to buy some Tom Clancy novels?,3,5 August 2002,"Oh dear, what a let-down. This movie left me with the feeling that two hours of my life had been stolen. OK, so this is Jack Ryan before Patriot Games (given that he's unmarried ... the movie is unclear on the time when it's set), so he has to be young, but Harrison Ford managed to portray Ryan as a nice guy, insecure but fundamentally smart, and Affleck just can't do it. He tries hard, but is handicapped [ironically] by his good looks and boyish smile. What is even worse is that the script does Affleck no favours. . He makes a crucial phone call to someone who doesn't trust him and fails to put the key information in the first sentence? That's fundamentally stupid. He dashes around the world like a demented chicken rather than staying cool and making a few phone calls? And then there's the plot holes: John Clark can't or won't speak Russian? He doesn't seem to know that most Ukrainians understand Russian? Cathy gets knocked over - inside a hospital - by a nuclear blast, stays there for hours afterwards, and doesn't suffer any radiation after-effects in later books? Come on, this is well beyond belief. [END SPOILER ALERT].Clancy writes well, and deserves credit for coming closer than anyone else to predicting September 11 in ""Debt of Honor"", which I read on a plane coming back from Japan :-( [END SPOILER ALERT], but watching this made me lose belief in Jack Ryan and therefore to lose interest in Clancy's books. I really am tempted to sell or donate all my Clancy novels and just keep ""Every Man a Tiger"" and ""Into the Storm"", where his ability to write military tactics combines with fact.Perhaps, though, ""Sum of all Fears"" is just a blip in Clancy's writing career. The following conversation took place in the men's restroom after the movie:Me: ""That was bad"". Him: ""Yeah, and the air-conditioning was freezing"". Me: ""Wasn't there some woman character in the book who made things really difficult for Ryan? She was totally missing from the movie"" Him: ""Oh, you've read the book?""

159,Big S-2,The Bum Of All Sequels,5,4 August 2002,"Oh Dear, as if it wasn't bad enough casting Mr. Charisma himself Ben Affleck as the hero Jack Ryan (Affleck isn't fit to shine predecessor Harrison Ford's shoes, much less step into them), we also had the novel's bad guys - Islamic fundamentalists - transformed for the movie into politically much ""safer"" white right-wing extremists. Never mind the fact that Muslim extremists today present the most credible potential perpetrators of such an attack. It would never do to say so in these politically correct times, now would it??!! Because that would be racist!!!! So instead let's just make like ostriches and bury our heads in the proverbial sand.The film is also displays a complete lack of continuity with the other Jack Ryan movies (this has already been dealt with extensively by other reviewers so I won't repeat the details). It's well known that movie-makers often treat their audiences like fools - so perhaps they figured that no-one would notice!! This movie would have been a whole lot better (a) with anyone but Ben Affleck (b) with Islamic extremists being portrayed as the (much more credible) bad guys (c) with continuity in line with the other Ryan movies or, failing that (d) creating another lead character to replace Ryan altogether and finally (e) eliminating the tiresome girlfriend character altogether (why is it that Affleck always has to be given some sort of romantic interest, even if it's of no relevance whatsoever to the main plot?).

Neo Nazis were used instead the original Al Queda terrorists. Nuff said.However, one great line was spoken and it was toward the very end of the film.

There is no requirement for the producers, including Tom Clancy, to follow the book to the letter, or even a little bit.I'm not sure if some Americans didn't like this movie because of the devastation that occured.

163,Big O-7,What fear?,5,4 June 2002,"Is there some written rule that all summer movies have to disapppoint?  The only thing this film really has going for it is a morbid curiosity involving a nuclear blast on American soil.  In the wake of September 11, I can certainly appreciate that.  In New York City, I can certainly appreciate that.  But when that morbid curiosity is all the suspense that the film has going for it, then I have to vote thumbs down on the film. Understand, I went to this film really wanting to like it.  But the nuclear blast happens about half way through the film, and after, there is absolutely no suspense.  YOU know that Jack Ryan is ultimately going to save the world.  So, what does this film have? Well, first of all, we have Morgan Freeman turning in yet another faxed in performance, which, by this time, is to be expected (Do I really need to keep paying him to do the same thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over again?  One is hard pressed to remember the days of DRIVING MISS DAISY, GLORY, and LEAN ON ME ... when he actually acted!).  I dare say he has not done one even remotely interesting performance since SEVEN. Next, we have Liev Schreiber - stepping in for Willem DaFoe who originally played the same part in the vastly superior CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.  Mr. Schreiber, however, seems to be playing a character - not a viewpoint like the rest of the cast. Then we have the rest of the cast - a who's who of top notch character actors.  We have Bruce McGill, Ron Rifkin, and James Cromwell.  All they get to do is present various (sometimes utterly inane) viewpoints as the President and his cabinet.  Does anyone really care about them? No, unless you want their scenes cut to shorten your time in the theater. And finally, in a role originated by Alec Baldwin and fleshed out by Harrison Ford, we have Ben Affleck.  Ben is an affable guy.  I usually like him.  But do I really need HIM to tell me how dire a situation a nuclear bomb in downtown Baltimore is?  No, and neither does any member of the audience. Lastly, the plot.  Well, I'm not going to spoil it for you, but the any sentence in this review is longer than a sentence needed to explain this particular plot.  And as said above, once the bomb goes off, there is no suspense, and no reason to stay in the theater.  A three year old can figure out how this plot is going to unflod having seen only the first five minutes of the film.  My advice?  Stay away.

Bruce McGill is in this thing, as are Ciarin Hinds, Philip Baker Hall, and Ron Rifkin, (from ""Alias""). I thought the decision-making of the Soviet and American presidents, as they get ever closer to mutually assured destruction, was depicted quite well. And yes, the special effects were very good. Like the helicopter crashes. How do they do that stuff? Anyway, in real life, we don't need third-party bad guys to lure us into a needless war. We elect people who do that, and THEY bring in guys like Chalabi to help out. And, I don't know.

Such interesting movies are usually hard to come by, especially by accident like borrowing this from a friend. The acting is nice and the director is good too.

Back door intelligence gathering, otherwise known as counter-intelligence? Sven Ole Thorsen can play his role in the Sum of All Fears as the tough guy clamping down on loose ends. While Governor Scharzenegger can refute his fascist right wing past and play by the rules with the United Nations according to the laws of the United States of America. You'll notice that Arnold keeps track of his past like he was human clock ticking with his father's past inscribed on his conscience. Arnold is also always on camera proclaiming the victories of the 6th largest economy in the world within the State of California like a proud parent of something he alone developed, with so much charisma as from his boyhood. Luckily the Sum of All Fears is just a movie and Sven Ole Thorsen only plays the part of Russian intelligence officers in other cinema acting roles.I do not think Sven Ole Thorsen morally would conceal his ability to speak Russian or do business in Russia concerning the military as possible communist sympathizers may have during WWII. I do not know the actual account of deserters from the German military who did conceal their ability to speak Russian during this era. Concerning morals and military ethics with film The Sum of All Fears history has taught some lessons concerning this already, involving the ethics of war and the political economy. German V-2 rockets into London without chemical warheads just as Russian Katsusya rockets landed in Israeli. The golden rule of war-fare seems to be universal, those who have all the gold rule.Sven Ole Thorsen plays a terrific role in the Sum of All Fears film strangling his victims with superior upper body strength like a real terminator.

170,Progressive-Element,Better-than-average thriller,6,26 May 2013,"With Harrison Ford out, it was decided the Jack Ryan series, which had so far proved very profitable at the box office, was to be rebooted, with Ben Affleck taking over. While the film was a financial success, it proved to be far less successful than the previous films, and it's telling that 11 years later, they're attempting another reboot of the series.Affleck is likable, but he doesn't have anything close to the presence Alec and Harrison had. He is far outclassed by costars such as Morgan Freeman, Alan Bates, James Cromwell, and taking over from Willem Dafoe, Liev Schreiber as John Clark. It's interesting to note how Clark is introduced, a lone mysterious figure standing in the rain - it's fair to assume Clark, a regular and very popular character in the Ryan books, was to appear in further movies.To accommodate Ben as Jack, the book has undergone an extensive change, with Jack now a young rookie analyst, yet to be married to Cathy. While the simple premise remains the same - terrorists build nuclear device from Israeli weapon left over from Yom Kippur War and use it to provoke nuclear war between US and Russia, Jack is forced to end the crisis himself by going directly to the Hot Line - one can't help feeling extremely cynical about the change of villains. In the book, the main villains are Palestinians, helped by a former left-wing German terrorist, and an American Indian extremist. In the film we get....neo-Nazis. As good as Alan Bates is as the megalomaniacal fascist Austrian politician, it is difficult to take seriously the scenario.In fact, the film's biggest problem is this - they are trying to present it as a more-realistic-than-usual thriller, yet at the same time, the film has cartoonish villains, and there are a great number of moments that take us out of realism and into pure fantasy.As problem-riddled as the film is, one area it does not fail at is entertaining the viewer. If one distances themselves from the previous films, the books, it is still a pretty good thriller that always keeps your attention glued to the screen. It's pace goes along at a fair clip, and there are some standout sequences. The best sequence is obviously when the nuke goes off. No last minute stopping the bomb here, it does indeed go off, and it marks the point where the film changes direction, presenting us with an intense doomsday scenario that keeps worsening by the minute.Deeply flawed, but satisfying entertainment.",The Sum of All Fears
171,pluto-11,Awful... Just Awful,3,12 February 2004,"Someone noted that it was stupid to compare a movie with the book it is based on. Personally, I think it is natural to do so when the quality of the plot (the aspect both mediums have in common, a plot) is considerably changed between the two, either for the better or the worse. In this case, the movie chooses to change the ""baddies"" from Arab terrorists to Nazi's??? The one thing that makes a Clancy novel so good is its ability to project verisimilitude in its fictional scenarios - one feels like ""this could happen"" while reading, that is what makes it thrilling!
Why, oh why, did the film maker choose Nazi's over Arabs as the villains - the real Nazi's need walkers to get around, they are so old. The new neo Nazi is so laughable as an international threat... Rejects from Jerry Springer launching a complex plan to steal a nuclear warhead!!! Hah! If you listen to the comment track on the DVD, Clancy snorts and laughs when this topic is brought up; it is obvious what he thinks about the plausibility of Nazi terrorism. I got the impression that it was the director's wishy washy smooshy PC politics that motivated this lame change in the plot - if he had problems with the plot he should have passed over the project, not wimpify it as he did. Finally, the choice of Affleck for Ryan! This casting choice bewilders... he seriously lacks the gravitas of either of the previous Ryan choices. They should have used Liev Schreiber who plays John Clark for the Ryan role instead - when they are on the screen together it is so obvious who one follows and takes seriously on screen, Schreiber just blows Affleck away. This lousy choice of leading man ranks up there with casting Lazenby in the Bond series.Lame, lame, lame.

I'm always waiting to hear him say: ""and i'll f*** her in an uncomfortable place..."" (See Mallrats). Anyway, he delivers perfectly.Now the problems (and the spoilers!!). Is it me or is the US navy portrayed as a bunch of idiots? How can russian Migs come within 1 mile of a carrier group undetected??? Also, is russian air control so incompetent that US jets can actually overfly a military base undetected ? The movie also gives a very bad image of russian border guards... Let's say that had we known the russian border was so loosely guarded, we would have invaded the country long ago ;-)As this movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel, I also saw the usual ""oh-so-highly-sophisticated"" character development, typical of Clancy's work.

175,Undead_Master,Enthralling film. LOVED IT,10,30 October 2002,"After reading several negative reviews, I was shocked when I finally saw `The sum of all fears'. I simply LOVED this movie . It was totally thrilling. It had all the ingredients of a great adventure and to top it off it was visually poetic and emotionally stirring. I never read the book this is based on, and I'm  not a Tom Clancy fan. I came into this movie expecting to hate it, because I have hated all the other films in the Jack Ryan series. They were too dry and technical, lacking immediacy or emotion and they felt more like lectures on the way government works and how the military operates than movies. Those films were made for Tom Clancy fans. The sum of all fears was made for a different audience, which is unfortunate since it is based on one of his novels. There is no doubt that it crosses the line into fantasy several times for dramatic effect. Things happen that probably wouldn't happen in real life. People do things that are impossibly heroic and unrealistic. I'm convinced this is why Clancy fans hate this adaptation.  For me, these traits (considered flaws by many people) helped free the movie from the constraints of absolute realism, allowing it to become more poetic and powerful than it ever could be otherwise.Director Phil Alden Robinson deserves most of the praise for this film. He's a new name for me, but looking at his filmography, it was interesting to see that he was the writer and director  for field of dreams, another film that I totally loved.  He was a very odd choice to helm this film, because field of dreams is a bizarre movie where reality and fantasy meet head on. It's an ultra surreal American fairy tale. It's like a happy David Lynch film, or a Luis Buñuel film with a wholesome center. This is not the kind of director you would normally choose to make a movie like the sum of all fears. The clash between the ultra realism of Clancy's material and Robinson's willingness to forgo realism in favor of  dreamy fairy tale lyricism creates a wonderful sense of vibrancy that I would never have anticipated.After seeing the sum of all fears, I am now convinced that Robinson will go on to make a huge name for himself. He is a truly gifted director with an incredible ability to communicate through images. I can't wait to see his next film. If field of dreams is any indication, he is just good a writer as he is as a director, and I am excited to see what other sorts of ideas he might produce.The movie also has tremendous performances by Morgan Freeman, and (surprisingly) Ben Affleck. He's way to young to play Jack Ryan, so he doesn't even try. The Jack Ryan in this movie is a reinvented character. He's basically a young guy, with the mentality of an idealist,  working his way up in the CIA, while trying to juggle a bachelors social life. For me, he works in this film and he plays that kind of character perfectly.
The bottom line is this: If you love Tom Clancy and you've read every one of his books,  you're probably going to hate this movie. If you have never read the book, and have no real interest in Clancy's work, you'll probably at least enjoy it. If your like me, and you don't mind films that let drama interfere with rationality, you'll probably love it.",The Sum of All Fears

177,erikgloor,Unbelievable patchwork of trailer clips. One half star of 4.,2,6 June 2002,"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This movie sucked and here's why.Tom Clancy meant his Jack Ryan character to be America's answer to James Bond: An exceptionally smart spy minus the violence and sleaze. A family man. That's why ""Hunt for Red October"" is the best of the Clancy adaptations. The Ryan character was true to form and Baldwin was perfect for the role. Ford was good, but kind of bumbling and vulnerable. He was purposefully so, but it just betrayed the character I thought. Ryan's a confident overachiever. Not a sad-faced Boomer carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. Affleck plays the role like the clueless Gen-Xer that he is and it just comes off as too unbelievable. When he all-of-a-sudden speaks Ukrainian right when he needed to, I did not believe that this character would have stayed in those nights he'd be required to stay in to learn Ukrainian, but would have, instead, given in, and gone off to the bar with his friends to watch the game. I just didn't buy it. Not for a second. Maybe Russian. But not both Russian and Ukrainian. And naturally, the fabulous babe he's courting is a doctor. I didn't know they let 23-year-old swimsuit models be doctors. This couple is entirely too cute to be that smart and NOT be totally uptight.Next, if our president and his aids were ever as trigger-happy and glib about starting Armageddon as they were portrayed to be in this film, we'd all have been dead a long time ago. It defies reason that if Russia were going to nuke us, they'd ***SPOILER WARNING*** just hit one city. They'd try to wipe us out in one overwhelming strike. Watching the conversations between the president and his advisors in this movie was like watching a Three Stooges short -- complete with pratfalls courtesy of the guy best remembered as the library cop from 'Seinfeld.' Completely boring.Thirdly, in the book,***SPOILER WARNING*** a small nuclear detonation levels a football stadium. Pretty scary. But the movie made it look like the whole of Baltimore went up like Hiroshima. Cars, helicopters, and hospitals presumably miles away from the stadium, certainly out of site of the stadium, are tossed around like something out of ""The Day After."" BUT THEN, the movie tries to be true to the book and say that it was mainly just the stadium that was destroyed. WHAT?!?! When I went to see the film after seeing the trailers, I'd presumed that they ramped up the explosion to satisfy their special effects department and put butts in theater seats. But they try and have it both ways. Preposterous.Fourth,***SPOILER WARNING*** who are these silly fascist bad-guys and how is it they're smart enough to be able to afford fancy office space and gold wrist-watches, but not smart enough to realize that if they get Russia and America to nuke each other, there won't be any world left to rule anyway?In addition to these four tests of your ability to suspend disbelief, the rest of this film was banal Hollywood sludge straight out of a made-for-TV movie. See, it's funny because he's trying ro tell her the truth about what he does for a living and she thinks it's some kind of lame excuse to get out of their dinner date. Fabulous! Bravo! Methinks not. Not since the film ""Armageddon"" have I so suspected that what the makers of this film did was shoot the trailers first and squish the rest of the movie in between them like styrofoam filler.And lastly, I have to believe Morgan Freeman is getting tired of taking roles in which he's the good-hearted, sensible older black guy who inspires the white male lead to do the right thing after being sacrificed on the altar of racist guilt. Just once I'd like to see the white guy get creamed and have Morgan get all p***ed about it.I told you it sucked.This movie review by Erik Gloor",The Sum of All Fears
178,willcrabbe,Underrated political thriller,7,14 June 2021,"This film is definitely one for my 'criminally underrated' list. Not underrated in terms of success, as it brought in three times its budget at the box office, but in terms of critical and general response. I see so many highly negative reviews of this film and I can't quite understand why. Sure, It may be a little slow to build up, but after the major inciting event of the film occurs, the tension and action do not let up. The score from Jerry Goldsmith is magnificent and really helps to elevate the drama and grand-scale of the film.Really, I strongly recommend this film if you're looking for a taut political thriller.

It's about politics all right; it reminded me a lot of Roger Donaldson's ""Thirteen days"": USA and Russia at the brink of World War III. The difference is that ""Thirteen days"" is real history.This movie is about a rookie Jack Ryan who unexpectedly finds himself climbing steps in the CIA in the middle of a potential nuclear war between USA and Russia.Personally, I still don't see why they cast Ben Affleck as the hero type of character. He didn't make it in Pearl Harbor and the doesn't make it in this one. He's better off in supporting roles as in ""Good Will Hunting"".As I expected, Morgan Freeman steals every frame of the movie.

This was then used by the group against the United States for it's (perceived, although arguable) propping up of the 'Isreali Terrorist State'.When it came time for Hollywood to make a film of it however things changed course and it was a radical right-wing group working for Aryan(?) supremacy that became the villain.I have to laugh when a book following the fictional, although believable, course of events when a Muslim group bombs the financial backers of the Jewish state gets engineered into 'euro Nazis' attack the U.S for world domination.The idealogical stranglehold of Hollywood continues and anyone who questions it is usually sanctioned and/or accused of antisemitism.Let's see if this one makes it to the board...",The Sum of All Fears

I like this movie, I think it has a really good story. Ben Affleck isn't as good as some of the other actors to have played Jack Ryan, but I think he does a decent job. I do however think Liev Schrieber is a good John Clark, and I may actually prefer him to Wilem Dafoe's portrayal. The film seems to get hate for deviating from the book, which never bothers me that much, as long as its the same story. I've never read the book, but I do know that it's 900 pages long, so obviously some stuff was going to be cut. The movie has some good humor as well, but it has a dark tone to it, which is handled really well. Also, since this came out a decade after the Cold War ended, we get a non-propaganda portrayal of the Russians. I've heard it's Al-Qaeda who plant the bomb in the book, which could've worked better, but I didn't mind the fascism sub- plot. This still feels like an intelligent movie, as all the Jack Ryan movies do, so I'll give it a pass on a few moments that feel kind of... dumb.

Being a Tom Clancy fan and a follower of the books, you start to get a feel for what could be converted into a movie maintaining the thrilling nail biting story with the the key characters being utilised with the upto date fashion of the world of geo-politics or current affairs and trends e.g Red October(cold war), Patriot Games(irish terrorism) and Clear President Danger(columbian drugs).This movie based on the book fails to maintain the key bad guys in the novel, Arab Terrorists trying to sabotage the Israel-Palestine Peace talks (tip for a movie)!   This film tries to make us believe unconvincingly that there is a both a threat by WWII German neo-nazi's decendants and the poor loser of the cold war, former Soviet Union, now a part of Nato for the past year, duh!This story is so out of touch even the winning combination of Harrison Ford and Philip Noyce the Director of Patriot Games and Clear Present Danger, avoided this script and turned it down like a four day old sandwich and who could blame them!

Intelligence Chief Cabot [Morgan Freeman] has Jack Ryan [Ben Affleck] accompany him on a Russian trip.  Ryan is a CIA egghead historian and expert on the new President Nemerov.  Both the Russians and Americans know three Russian nuclear scientists are missing. Mix this trio with an unexploded bomb from the Golan Heights, vacant nuclear facilities in Ukraine, the Super Bowl and Dressler [Alan Bates] a neo-Nazi with a global network, and you've got a cliffhanger.  Ryan teams up with CIA operative John Clark [Live Schreiber] to cut the fuse on this explosive situation.  Sum of All Fears is a fast moving Tom Clancy cocktail with a nuclear chaser. Like most Clancy stories it's just on the other side of totally believable, allowing you imagination free reign.  The previews tell us that a nuclear weapon explodes, this is not the point.  The story is interesting because, although it's fiction it's not unrealistic, and illustrates how two nuclear powers react and interact when one is attacked.  This offers some degree of comfort, unless you're living in Baltimore MD.  The story plays out on a macro level between US President Fowler [James Cromwell] and his Russian counterpart [Cairian Hinds] and there are some tense moments.  Ryan [Affleck], Chief Cabot [Freeman] and Clark [Schreiber] give the micro view of events.

Ben Affleck drives a pick up truck through nuked out Baltimore without a problem.  Bridget Moynahan's hair should be falling out, but it's not even out of place.While we're at it- Wouldn't the people investigating ground zero have a direct line to the President, telling him, not Ben Affleck, that it wasn't the Russians? If an Israeli jet carrying a nuke was shot down, especially over enemy territory, wouldn't someone try to retrieve it?  Did they just hope no one would notice a nuclear warhead in their backyard?Even popcorn actions films like Broken Arrow and almost any given Bond film get this stuff down.I did like Liev Schreiber's character, as well as the Godfather-esque revenge ending, but the plot makes this a lesser film.",The Sum of All Fears

That tells you how much thought was put into this giant piece of crap.The plot involves neo-Nazi's who obtain an Israeli nuclear bomb (from an Israeli plane that was shot down in the 1973 Yom Kippur war) and use Russian nuclear scientists to refurbish it, and then ship it to Baltimore (just in time for the Super Bowl) to try to blow up the President of the US.The Nazi's goal is to trick the US into thinking the Russians carried out the attack, hopefully starting a nuclear war which then allows the neo-Nazi's to do what exactly? Take over the smoldering remains of the earth? The movie never adequately explains the rationale behind their actions, since their actions are completely self-defeating. A nuclear exchange between the US and Russia would destroy most of the Western World, leaving precious little left for the Nazi's to rule over. In the novel, Islamic terrorists were the bad guys, which makes sense since they don't care if they live or die and because the Middle East would be relatively unaffected by a nuclear war between Russia and the US. Changing the villains to Nazi's sends this movie into fantasy-land.Ben Affleck is wrong as Jack Ryan -- he's just too much of a sarcastic punk. You can't buy him as the CIA analyst turned action hero. The rest of the cast is good, but most of the characters are complete idiots. Its hard to believe that the President of the US and the Premier of Russia wouldn't talk to each other over the telephone during an international crisis, but in this movie they e-mail each other over AOL like a couple of adulterers.According to the trivia, Harrison Ford and Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Air Force One) turned down the opportunity to participate in this fiasco.

191,deltadave669,Ben Affleck saves the world,7,2 June 2002,"I found this to be an enjoyable flick. It is slow getting started, but once it gets up to speed, it really gets moving. This is not a sock-em-up action film, but rather a political chess game-style thriller. And thrill it does. As you go deeper into the film, you watch breathlessly, wondering just how close these people will come to blowing up the world before the one man with the truth (Affleck's Jack Ryan)can overcome obstacles in his way deliver the truth to the people who REALLY need to hear it.Morgan Freeman is easily the top choice for best performance as Mr Cabot, the CIA Director. It's when he finally gets teamed up with Affleck's Ryan that the picture gets moving. As for Ben Affleck, he plays Jack Ryan as if he were Ben Affleck. To put it another way: If someone were to make a movie called ""The Ben Affleck Story"", Ben Affleck would be the ideal actor to play the lead. Whether or not you think he did a good job playing Ryan depends greatly on whether or not you like Ben Affleck. The president and the balance of his cabinet are played by some of the biggest character actors in Hollywood. James Cromwell, Ron Rifkin, Bruce McGill, and the guy who played the game show host in ""Magnolia""; they all put on fine performances. Liev Schreiber offers up quite the cool cat as John Clark (I believe they are preparing a movie for Rainbow Six so they can spin Clark off into his own series).As to the re-vamping of the story to make Ryan a much younger man, I thought it worked well. The problem with keeping Ford as the lead is the man is in his 60s now, and the only way to have kept him believable throughout the book series would have been to make them all consecutively, and that wasn't going to happen.Also, I think that some of the criticisms levelled at this movie are unfounded.

193,MovieCriticDave,The Clancy series is dead.,4,12 February 2006,"It is, at best, disheartening to see a movie franchise so thoroughly spoiled as the Clancy/Jack Ryan once-diamond-in-the-rough series, now turned into fool's gold with bad direction, bad adaptation, and a myopically teenage star. Combine that with a goofy Wargames-like ending that just leaves you shaking your head, and you've written your own summary (or is that obituary?) for ""Sum of All Fears."" ""Fears"" was an obvious and failed attempt to resuscitate the blockbuster franchise started with the Alec Baldwin megahit, ""The Hunt For Red October."" Correctly departing from the misguided effort to bring Harrison Ford into Ryan's role when Baldwin opted out, producers swung too far the opposite direction with Ben Affleck. Affleck's youthful appearance is likely more in keeping with the intended nature of the Ryan character, but Affleck comes off more as a ditzy wannabe rather than a CIA protégé.""Fears"" carries with it not one-tenth the intrigue of its written counterpart, and not even half the credibility of ""Red October."" Its mock intrigue truly is nothing more than a phony Hollywood ending, one that reduces Ryan to Matthew Broderick in doubletalking the computer into self-destructing at the end of Wargames.Worse still is the sellout to political correctness in ""Fears,"" wherein the book tells a story of all-too-relevant political intrigue that is replaced by a plainly fractious substory about Russian racial and ethnic stereotypes. Ahh, the comfort of warm milk before bedtime.This movie well deserves to put an end to the Clancy series, never to reclaim its ""October"" glory.

194,spazierganger,"Has some good qualities, but it's not exciting enough",5,22 July 2002,"I went into ""The Sum of All Fears"" expecting to be disappointed by Ben Affleck. I'm not really a fan of much of his dramatic work (""Changing Lanes"" is an exception). I have not seen the other Jack Ryan movies, but I still didn't really think Affleck would make a credible CIA agent. So I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. It certainly isn't Oscar material, but he is very credible, which was more than I was expecting. The supporting cast is also quite good, especially the always impressive Morgan Freeman as Affleck's mentor and Ciaran Hinds as the Russian president.Speaking of the Russian president, I was impressed by the way the film portrayed him. Usually, foreign leaders in films are very one-dimensional. President Nemerov, however, is very well developed, with clear motivations for his actions. He is not the evil madman Hollywood commonly makes foreigners (especially Russians) out to be. In fact, he is arguably a better person than the film's American president. So I commend the writers for that.However, despite the acting and the good characters I did not really enjoy this film. Why? Because it's supposed to be suspenseful, and it's not. I know that Jack Ryan is trying to avert a major world crisis, but having him run around with a cell phone and type on computers does not generate much suspense. This is what a lot of the film, including the ""climax"" basically comes down to. The film is not deep enough to be a serious drama, so it needs the suspense and the action to deliver. Unfortunately, this does not happen. Although ""The Sum of All Fears"" does have some good qualities, it ultimately fails to deliver the basic needs of the genre, so I can't really recommend it. You could definitely do worse, but you could also do a lot better.Rating: 5/10",The Sum of All Fears
195,cgbarr-73033,Meh,7,15 September 2020,"Overall, this is something I'd recommend if you have absolutely nothing to watch. Just because of the quality production, it's a fairly good movie. However, the plot itself lacks genuine believability and is a bit ridiculous at some points.First of all, this movie subtly paints anyone who leans politically toward the right wing spectrum as fascist by blatantly and obviously associated them with nazis (which is petty and ignorant to say the least). Now since this is perfectly normal from Hollywood, let's get on to the parts that are more universally accepted as degrading factors to the quality of film: the plot itself is sort of ridiculous; it becomes almost entirely apocalyptic at one point. Not only that, but there are some scientifically questionable things happening (or more accurately *not* happening) after a major plot point. The scenes bounce from character to character in a very choppy and noticeable way- you'll be following the story, and then you suddenly have to watch that one spy guy that you forgot about, whose going on some random side quest; the director emphasizes each characters' importance intentionally to excuse their existence; however, I don't think they were important enough or consistently present enough to make their presence in the story flow. The score was good- the theme's melody, in my opinion, was kind of reminiscent to Auld Lang Syne because of the chord progression- the composer was giving me good vibes and using interesting techniques throughout (it wasn't good enough that I would listen to the score in my own free time though). Ben Affleck in any movie is a kind of poor casting choice in my opinion because he isn't the best actor (this movie is a testimony to that), but the rest of the cast is perfectly fine. I prefer this Russian president far more than Branagh's evil villain portrayal in that other Jack Ryan movie (No offense to Branagh but he tends to be overly dramatic when he's his own boss).That's about it though.

The movie was quite good, with some excellent acting from many characters - but I could never buy into Jack Ryan.  After putting Harrison Ford in the last two Jack Ryan movies (Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games) it was hard for me to accept relative newbie Ben.

Technically, it is well made, but the plot seems contrived and the tension wears out as you see the two sides continuously escalating for no real reason - predictably, the protagonist discovers the simple truth and is repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to communicate it. This blocking is obviously just a plot device to heighten tension and anxiety in the audience. But it just becomes tedious.

203,D. Vader-2,Better than Ok,6,1 June 2002,"Sum of all Fears is a movie that is based on a Tom Clancy novel which i never read.  However, I assure you the movel must be better because Tom Clancy novels always are.  This is a prequel to ""Clear and Present Danger"", a great movie to see.  The movie has a nice plot, and at least moves along at a decent pace.  However, the movie lacked substance.  Not to mention my Russian friend informed me that Ben ""Af-wack"" Russian waas pretty bad. There are some flaws throughout that eventually add up and get to be a little annoying. SPOILER ALERT My favorite mistake is how Jack Ryan is somehow able to use the radio after is helicopter is brought down after a nuclear blast.  Let us suppose this happened in real life.  After the blast, ALL the circuitry would have been fried.  Nothing in the helicopter would work.  Even if his magical radio was able to survive the blast, which it did, there would be so much radio wave interference that commuinications would be impossible.The clash between Russia and the US is well done, and very realistic.

The very things that make the books popular (multiple dense story lines) make them impossible for the most part to film.  The Sum Of All Fears is the latest example of this.  They pretty much took the title of the film and a couple of scenes, names of characters, and made a different film.  Setting it in the present doesn't help, changing Arab terrorsts to neo nazi's is completely ridiculous, taking the family aspect out of Jack Ryan's character diminishes his depth. Clancy is somewhere counting the dollars, and I know that previously (Patriot Games) he has refused to let them use his name in advertising, but dang. Affleck's acting is adequate, but he will never be able to get past the fact that he's Ben Affleck.  He has plenty of charisma, but none of the intelligence and depth of a Ford or Alec Baldwin.

The story is just some scary crap that seems to me to be ill-timed shock effect (affect?) riding on American fears of terrorists. The details are barely plausible and the way it is logistically constructed is many times quite ludicrous.

Condensing that into a two hour movie is not only a daunting task, but a near impossible one as evidenced by the sloppy manner in which the plot unfolds.  It feels as though a bunch of crucial scenes were slapped together, with no explanation of how the characters get from point A to point B.  The result is a mess which leaves way too many questions unanswered.Other problems include the lack of character development in the neo-Nazi character, poor casting (Liev Schreiber as John Clark?  Give me a break), and most appallingly, a woefully boring nuclear explosion.  What you see in the TV spots is what you see on screen.  Some cars get blown off the road, a helicopter crashes, and there's one shot of a mushroom cloud.  Up to this point I was wondering how they were going to top the nuclear explosion in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" but sadly they didn't even try.And finally, there's Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan.  He just doesn't inhabit this role.  He's no Harrison Ford, nor is he Alec Baldwin.  As far as I'm concerned, this franchise is dead.Rating: 4/10",The Sum of All Fears

233,InvisibleSwordsman,Interesting reinvention of Jack Ryan,7,13 July 2005,"When it was first announced that Ben Affleck would be assuming the role of Jack Ryan, I was utterly horrified. It's difficult enough for anyone to follow Harrison Ford, much less the star of ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Armageddon."" And, of course, any semblance of continuity would be destroyed - we could buy Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford were the same character, but Baldwin, Ford, then Affleck? So, it was with low expectations that I approached this adaptation of one of my least favorite Tom Clancy novels - and I was pleasantly surprised. Of course Affleck is no Ford (or Baldwin, for that matter), but is surprisingly effective in this re-imagined version of a younger Jack Ryan, which still feels enough like the original character to work. And Morgan Freeman, as a reworked variation of the character previously played by James Earl Jones (though with a different character), steals every scene he's in. Phil Alden Robinson's direction is taut and exciting.While ""The Sum of All Fears"" doesn't equal ""The Hunt for Red October"" or ""Clear and Present Danger"", it stacks up favorably against the uneven ""Patriot Games"", and is a welcome addition to the Jack Ryan film franchise.",The Sum of All Fears

Another patriotism-heavy Yank action thriller, probably going to be quite good fun, but nothing else to speak of, and maybe quite sickeningly stoic in the face of the new adversity blah blah blah blah. In part, I was right, I suppose. Ben Affleck provides very typical American smouldering-but-wooden star fare, in fact he was disappointingly off his best form, not that it would have made much difference since the fella could never have made himself look all that great when paired with Morgan Freeman, who produced the sort of fantastic role that we have come to expect of the film legend. But did the film fall victim to the temptation of a 'Stars and Stripes' flag-waving-fest, a sort of Pearl Harbour amplified by the emotions of the war on terror? Yes and No. Of course, the film leaves you with a very serious concern about nuclear proliferation and global terrorism - probably just what Cheney, Rumsfield and co. would love us to be feeling right now - and the film evokes a very palpable poignancy with lines such as 'there has been a terrorist attack on America' which clearly plays on the 'gulp factor'. However, the film is far from merely a shameless wallowing in national pride in the wake of terrorism. Let us not forget that the villains of the piece are primarily Europeans, not Arabs, and the film breaks fresh ground in acknowledging the US's own culpability for the spread of nuclear weapons outside the superpowers. Above all else, the film - in particular the sound and cinematography, which should both get Oscars - is captivating, and it is a rare thing indeed that I have actually been moved by a film as much as I was two-thirds of the way through this one. The Baltimore episode left me absolutely awestruck - to be honest I just didn't see it coming - and really quite emotionally drained. Such a catharsis is just not something you expect from a self-proclaimed action thriller 'Sum of All Fears'. A few loose ends around the edges demand a slight willing suspension of disbelief, but it is a suspension I for one was more than willing to give after the middle section of the film. As well as the usual top class performance from Freeman, Liev Schreiber was for me a surprise class act, capturing a character few films have focussed on in the 'invisible' secret agent. Indeed, the portrayal of the secret services is one of the highlights of this movie, and the wry post-West Wing humanisation of the political heavyweights in the movie (another more-than-decent performance in James Cromwell's President, for example) only adds to a great all-round spectacle. One to watch if you want something to make you go 'wow'. Trust me, it will.",The Sum of All Fears
241,bigtron,One of the more exciting movie of recent times,8,3 June 2002,"Spoiler Alert In the tradition of Clancy movies, this movie manages to keep a very exciting pace up until the end. Ben Affleck is credible as the young Ryan (although his character has nothing more to do than look and act out of his place, in the move that is). Liev Schreiber's role as John Clack is refreshing and fun while Morgan Freeman has been reduced to the token, wise old black man, acting as a mentor to a younger inexperience character (see High Crimes) and of course he has to die to pave the way for Ryan. Other reviews have said that the two governments acted in a stupid way but people presume too much of their government. (there are enough real-life bungling of international affairs or matters relating to the well-being of the country, for people to presume that they can handle a real end-of-the-country nuclear treat). Plus the russian president just got elected and according to Ryan is only pretending to be a hard liner and therefore it is reasonable to presume that he was being 'push around' by his generals into his actions (plus he has been betrayed by his own army in the Checnia attack) while the American president just survived a nuclear bomb and thousands of his citizens has just been murdered with the potential for millions more. It should not be surprising that they are not acting with a cool head.I am not sure but did they stole the music from Crimson Tide (which is by the way the most exciting war music of recent times) The movie also have some well placed humor(when the president is being led off, the scene looks like better than anything Candid Camera can come up with, where people do not know what to do, run and possibly save their own lives or risk looking like a fool). I am surprise that some of the well-paid football players do not decided to save their own skins.As for complaints of changing from muslim extremist to neo-nazis, they should know that even in real life, Osama has not been found, thus ending the movie with the muslim extremist in hiding and the us special forces looking in caves is not a very satisfying ending. Finding a bunch of old wealthy white guys presents no problems at all.This move goes to show that all action scenes are not necessary to make a successful and very enjoyable movie. 8/10 for the movie but 10/10 for enjoyment and excitement.",The Sum of All Fears

243,mikey1969,"Garbage, total sellout garbage",1,15 June 2003,"To start with, I am a Tom Clancy fan, I have been for years. I have actually met Secret Service agents and confirmed that his info tends to be rather accurate. Jack Ryan is a great character, but this movie was junk.When I heard this movie was coming out, I was excited. I had thoroughly enjoyed the book, and thought they couldn't possibly screw this up at all. Then I read a brief synopsis. Suddenly, in the post-9/11 era, when fanatic muslims would usually be the villain of choice, anyway, somebody decides to jump on the P.C. bandwagon, and changes the bad guys to redneck white supremacists. I was floored. I can understand rewriting certain parts of a storyline, but completely switching the polarity of the bad guys is just silly. I finally decided to see the movie when it came out on DVD, and was even more disappointed. Suddenly Jack Ryan is just starting out at the CIA as an analyst? Wasn't that back around 'Hunt For Red October'? He hasn't even gotten married yet? His wife suspecting him of cheating was a major part of the plot. How can she suspect him of cheating if she hasn't even married him yet? This story takes place AFTER 'Clear and Present Danger', yet we have all these inconsistencies? I just can't understand why this movie got such a high rating in the first place... To me, this was a sellout from the beginning, and I can't believe Clancy gave his blessing on this. If he felt that Harrison Ford was getting too old, there was much more he could have done, and still saved the integrity of the series. Ben Affleck could play a late-twenties/early-thirties hero with no problem, but instead we get an obvious 'money-grab' by hiring the young actor and playing the story to a younger crowd. Who cares that Jack Ryan met 'Mr. Clark' ages ago, and he and Ding Chavez are actually Ryan's bodyguards by this point? And by the way, how come Jack Ryan's 'wireless internet' PDA was working after 1: a nuclear blast that would have most likely caused an EMP blast knocking out such silly things as cell-phone towers?, and 2: How was it connecting to the internet with no wireless plug in card or anything to make an ordinary PDA bluetooth compatible? Personally, I would give this movie a 1.",The Sum of All Fears
244,cionex,The Sum of all Film-Goers' Fears,4,8 June 2002,"An unbelievably trite, watered down, insipid film.  If you saw ""The Player"", you may recall how focus groups and testing twisted a filmmaker's vision into a mindless piece of pap, primarily through a hilarious ending change.If only this film were ONLY that cynical.  There's enough factual errors to fill a warehouse, but that's part of the movies, so no real big deal there. The really horrific swill comes from dialogue so mind-bendingly stupid and poorly delivered that it makes one long for ""Joe Dirt: The Director's Cut.""  Yes, Ben Affleck's an affable lightweight, but the no-talent actress playing his love interest is reminiscent of Pauly Shore doing Shakespeare, or the kid who played the lead in ""Star Wars: Episode I"".If you've read the book, don't see the film.  If you haven't read the book, read the book, then follow the instructions in the previous sentence. This movie assumes you have no brains, no interest in a coherent storyline, no ability to discern interesting visual effects from a few SUVs with lighter fluid on them, and no ability to resist incessant marketing.  It's horrible. Read between the lines on the other, more positive reviews -- this is a lightweight film that ""isn't too bad"" if you ""lower your expectations.""You shouldn't HAVE to lower your expectations.

245,lowth2000,Standard Stuff,6,20 August 2002,"By John LowtherThe plot looks involving, the cast looks strong, and the previous Jack Ryan stories to hit the big screen have been considerably above average.  
The plot was never entirely believable though, it didn't sit well or work somehow.  I know what your thinking, 'yeah right a terrorist attack on America pull the other one!'  It was not the scale of the attack that didn't work.  Nor the idea of a terrorist attack.  It was the conspiracy itself and in truth the characters who simply were not strong enough.After the film I asked my friends for the names of various characters, the only known one was Jack Ryan himself.  None of the characters were strong, not even Morgan Freeman.  There seemed to be absolutely no depth to any of them, they were interchangeable and represented nothing. 
The characters were not fleshed out enough.  There was no depth to them. This is why the film seemed so unbelievable but more importantly it made it dull.  The viewer didn't engage with the film fully because the characters lacked a human side.  Some blame it on Ben Afflec's acting but I favour the explanation that he didn't get a chance to do any acting.  Sure he ran about a bit, but the human relationships and basically the characters in general were not explored.  The film never quite moved out of second gear. 
His girlfriend was a weak character.  In the other Ryan films the family element has been a source of comparison for the viewer - a link to their lives.  A motivating factor that sucks people in and reifies the Ryan character.  This film lacked any grounding for Ryan.  He seemed to be a CIA agent and that was it.  Obviously, the girlfriend sub plot was slapped in to try and ground him - however it failed.  The girlfriend had little screen time, and little relevance.  Ryan was not an interesting character and he seemed quite dislodged from humanity.  The bad guys were just comic.  The poor characterisation of the fascists made the film less believable and retarded the excitement of the audience. That Alan Bates had to be identified as a fascist with a swastika on his watch said a lot about the subtlety on show.  I would rather not have him pigeon holed like that and if he was supposed to be a neo-nazi then there were better ways of showing this.  Generally Neo-Nazi's differ from the line of Hitler to some extent now, there views have changed on a lot of issues but none of this was shown.  They were simply Hitler's boys.  However, they didn't make sense - an international clique of nazis?!? Nazi and internationalist? Sounds as likely as a Communist CEO to me.  They seemed more like lonely old men.  Their motivations were largely confused and unexplored.  The European pan-nationalism thing had some promise but that was mentioned once and put on the backburner.  The idea of South Africa being involved confused things because they are outside of Europe, and if as Bates's Dr. Evil claimed that the point was to get all Aryans working together why plot the destruction of America?  The group also had problems about the destruction of Russia.  The baddies were a confused lot and the audience was left in some doubt over there motivations.  Surely to afford 50 million they would have to be a powerful terrorist group?  They were under developed and Bate's was seemingly in panto mode.  The film was quite dull, the characters underdeveloped.  The plot was also both underdeveloped and laboured.  The plot was not fleshed out with twists, turns and suspense.  Whilst the end was quite suspenseful it was never genuinely a clever film.  This was not brain fodder.  The plot was so very predictable and without much colour.  There was nothing interesting or new about it - though the production was slick enough.  A far better choice would be for all readers of this review to go and watch Dr Strangelove.  -Johnps.  The ending was also very smug.",The Sum of All Fears

Another Jack Ryan-movie. This is certainly not the best of them. Clancy's books are always better than the movies based on them. A lot of details and important parts have been left out. The ending of the movie is rather disappointing, I think. It is not exactly creative, nor does it inspire to discuss any relevant issues related to the subjects dealt with. If you like Jack Ryan simply read Clancy's books. That way you will get many hours of great entertainment. There are lots of well made scenes in this movie. It just lacks some punch, when the time comes to make a statement! The casting is fine. Most of the music has been stolen from Hans Zimmer, but Jerry Goldsmith gets credited for it. That is outrageous. The music in the movie can be found in ""Crimson Tide"" as well. Only a very little part of the music seems to have been made by Goldsmith himself for this specific movie.

249,shadow_empress,Compelling and dramatic.,9,8 November 2002,"I, personally, loved this film, though my Mother found it a tad confusing by the end.Based on a book by Tom Clancy (and executively produced by him, too), The Sum of All Fears is a dramatic, compelling story about CIA agents, and about terrorism.Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) is new to the CIA force.  He has a loving girlfriend, Cathy (Bridget Moynahan, who is a doctor, and whom Jack hopes to marry, he loves his job, and is fairly close to William Cabot (Morgan Freeman).  But how, oh, how, is Jack going to tell his lovely girlfriend that he's with the CIA?One particular funny part is where Freeman and Affleck are on a plane to a mission in Russia, and Affleck tries to tell Moynahan that their plans are spoiled because he's in the CIA, going on a secret mission; obviously, she doesn't believe him, and Freeman gets a kick out of that.Anyway, there is a bomb, and President Fowler, and the majority of the CIA force, seem to think it's the Russians who are the guilty ones.  I shan't spoil the film, so you'll have to see for yourself.The modus operandi of this film is to intrigue you to the plot, as well as make you think ahead to see 'whodunit'.",The Sum of All Fears
250,fugacity2000,Very decent thriller,9,7 July 2003,"The Tom Clancy movie mill had grown fairly stagnant recently, and, fortunately, The Sum of All Fears injects some new life into it.  It works very well as a political suspense flick, with enough action in it to make brain-dead movie fans like it.I was very pleased to see a post-9/11 movie about terrorists not deal with Islamic fundamentalists, but rather the more shifty neo-fascist right-wing groups all over the world.  The plot is mostly believable, and the tension developed between Russia and the U.S. sucks you in throughout.  The nuclear blast was a little disappointing, but given the fact that it was a low-yield weapon, I guess that's to be expected.  I was pleased that none of the performances were over-the-top, as each actor seemed to fit into their role very well.  Ben Affleck avoids overacting, for the most part, and Liev Schreiber was just great as the CIA agent Clark.

Perhaps they don't want the public to see a film where the President is strong, determined, and decisive as well as a war veteran (horror of horrors, a Marine!)and the CIA doing a good job.  The Sum of All Fears reminded me of the excellent film Thirteen Days and the Cuban missile crisis.  The film also reinforces the need for America to be vigilant and to take terrorism seriously.  Perhaps the critics don't like that as well.  They don't seem to think that Americans need to be reminded that something worse than 9-11 could happen if we aren't vigilant. Our enemies would like nothing more than to unleash a nuclear or biological weapon upon one of our cities and I am sure all their minds and efforts are bent on doing so.

They know everything about Ben Affleck (positively wooden in this performance) and his girlfriend, but can't stop a nuclear bomb from coming into the US because it was diverted through another country. They can't tell that Russia is not responsible and refuse to communicate with them about it. Harrison Ford is a charismatic leading man. Ben Affleck is not.

But not much to remember.With the opening credits still being displayed, the first big plot hole raised its ugly face: In 1973, an Israeli jet armed with an atom bomb is shot down by Arabs. And no one ever cares for the wreck in 28 years. Neither Arabs curious to see what they've hit show up, nor Israelis who want to get back their nuclear weapon which didn't explode and might be a serious threat to them if found by the wrong people.A little later, an Austrian speaking imo sensible words about Europe being under the leadership of the U.S. is identfied as a Nazi by a swastika on the back of his watch lying on his desk. Ha Ha. Why doesn't he wear a sign ""I am a Nazi"" round his neck?The film carries on with a cold-war scenario. Huh, this is past! And there's the second plot hole: While the president is still wondering whether the atom bomb that exploded in the U.S. was Russian or not - the CIA already has proven, it was not. But can they get to the President? Can they pass this information to him that will prevent World War III? No!And when Ben Affleck finally has a few seconds to speak to a man who has access to the President - does he tell him the crucial information: ""hey, our CIA labs have proven the plutonium was ours!"" ? No. He blah-blahs until the other man drops the phone or closes the door.No. Weird story, past's enemies, un-interesting effects (including the biggest laugh: a helicopter caught by a nuclear pressure wave, crashing and NOT exploding at all!).

Aside for the nuke making it into Baltimore and actually blowing up (finally, I have been watching movies my whole life, waiting for a nuke to actually hit its target), none of the rest of the plot made sense. Not that the events themselves (old nuclear bomb found, stolen, converted, shipped to the US, detonated - nuclear standoff ensues) could/would never happen, but the way that the story connected all the events was simply preposterous. This should not have been a Jack Ryan story. In order to involve him in the story (i.e. allow him to save the day), they had to twist the plot around far too much. It simply did not work. I could not suspend my disbelief because it did not even make sense how one thing connected to another.The worst thing about this movie, though, was the casting of Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan. He ruined the Jack Ryan character for me. When Harrison Ford played Jack Ryan, he was a MAN - a tough guy who took charge, stood up for his family and his principles, and kicked ass against the bad guys. In this movie, Ben Affleck (possibly the script, too) turns Jack Ryan into an office nerd who does not deserve or command respect, other than for the accuracy of a report he wrote back when he was an [even] younger agent. What kind of a hero is that? I felt like I may as well have been watching his character in Chasing Amy - he seemed that helpless and inconsequential. That is why it made even less sense when the screenwriters made him into the hero. But the best way they could come up with for him to save the world was by typing on text chat to the Russian President? I know it is 2003 and Instant Messenger is everywhere, but come on! How is this exciting? If I choose to see a standard Hollywood ""thriller"" about nukes and terrorism, I want it done right. They could have cast Adam Sandler and had him save the world by getting drunk and suggesting that we launch flaming poo instead of nukes at the Russians, and it would have been more interesting than this movie. 3/10 stars, and it gets 3 instead of 1 only because of Morgan Freeman's solid performance and because they actually had the guts to nuke a city.",The Sum of All Fears

269,Sandro-LN,"Bad, bad, BAD!",5,17 November 2002,"I can think of a few adjectives to describe this movie, clichéed and predictable particularly come to mind.  The movie starts out normally enough, with a decent setup for the climax.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either.  However, as it moved into the heavy action the plot became rather trite.Cliché #1: The young upstart with great potential but no experience (Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan) who is right about everything, but the old guard (James Cromwell as President Fowler and his advisors) refuses to listen to him.  Cliché #2: The car that won't start.  As Jack Ryan is rushing to get to a site where he can get further information, he swerves to avoid a fire truck and crashes.  After a quick message session on his palm pilot, he tries to restart the truck and it fails.  It was this moment that spoiled the movie for me.  ""The car that won't start"" has been used so many times it's sickening.  I expected better.  Cliché #3: The crisis is resolved with less than 30 seconds until total disaster.  I'll avoid detail there so I don't spoil the ending -- not that there's much to spoil -- but we've all seen this scenario plenty of times before.The special effects were good, as was the acting, but I wouldn't expect an Oscar for any of it.  The plot was decent, but I got more and more frustrated as I watched, because it was a constant state of escalation.  It was a movie in which you feel the need to scream at the screen, yelling ""NO, NO, NO!""  This movie is worth watching, however be sure to rent, not buy.5 out of 10",The Sum of All Fears
270,Vaiop,Critics are wrong!,6,1 June 2002,"I saw this movie because of the rave reviews it received from the ""critics"". For a movie based on a book, the script was a joke.  Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan is soooooooo not believable.  The action IS good but not anywhere close to advertised.  Morgan Freeman and L Schriber (sp?) stole the show, by virtue of their characters. The cinematography was very contrived.... Excessive camera movement and untimely close ups provided no contextual/artistic purpose.  I guess it was intended to  distract viewers from the butchered script/storyline.  If you are a Clancy/Affleck fan, you may actually enjoy this flick.",The Sum of All Fears
271,lumkinsc98,The Sum of All Fears = Dramatic Realism!,7,3 June 2002,"First off, allow me to explain what I mean by that. ""Fears"" was filmed early last year, long before 9/11. At that time, it was look at as nothing more than an political/action film, just like many before it. However, once 9/11 came around, the film began to mean much, much more. It went from being ""just another film"", to actually being a possibly blueprint on events which could actually occur in the USA, something that would not have been thought of as a possible reality, before 9/11. So, with all of that in mind... ...now, the film is looked at more so, as a dramatic interpretation of the world that we truly live in today. A world of true ist threat, a world of true lack of security in America, and above all else, a world in which the truly unthought of, can indeed be acted out upon.The Sum of All Fears however when looked at in it's whole form, as a film, leaves a bit to be desired. The buildup is fantastic, the action scenes and the horrific ""nuclear blast"" is truly emotionally unsetting, but after ""the big bang"" takes place, the film begins to dwindle down, as if Tom Clancy didn't know where to truly take it. I can not say much more, in fear of spoiling anything, but you will understand what I mean when you see it for yourself.The acting however, is top notch. The main two players here are Morgan Freeman and Ben Afleck. Freeman, who is almost always flawless, pulls out a convincing role here, and shines as always, but the big story is that of Afleck himself. Look at often as nothing more than a cookie-cutter persona on the big screen, he seems to be coming into his own. In Changing Lanes he began to show what he is truly about, and in ""Fears"" he goes the next step, proving (in my eyes at least), that he is much more than we all have come to expect from him. So yes, Afleck is looking very good, and comfortable, in his role here as Jack Ryan.Now, I'm heard many look at ""Fears"" and say that it was flawed, because of the failure to allow this Jack Ryan, to follow suit more so with the ones that have come before him, but in my view, that should not take away from this film. This film plays more so as a stand alone film, not to be thought of in the same way as the others. This is even more noticeable in the fact that this Jack Ryan is so much younger, and it is in current day. So do not allow this to take away from ""Fears"", because in doing so, you are only taking the petty, and making it much more than it should amount up to.Overall, I give this film a 7.5/10 rating. The fact that after the ""blast"", the film goes off in a direction which I would have preferred it not to, is the only reason I give it such a lower rating. But it is a must see, for everyone who can possibly get the chance... ...if you wish to see what could be reality, acted out before your eyes on the big screen, then this film, is the one for you!",The Sum of All Fears
272,NickSDV,Average Thriller,4,22 July 2002,"Good build up but this thriller is not always thrilling.  There is one good sequence that is tense, but it is hard to care about the characters.  The relationship with the girlfriend was lame.  Overall pretty average.",The Sum of All Fears
273,incrediball,Bears no resemblance to the original story,3,23 February 2020,"Really only about three things happen in the movie that are from the original story on which this movie is supposedly based. The first, the loss of a nuclear weapon during the Yom Kippur War, happens right away. The second, the nuclear explosion at the Super Bowl in the book takes about 800 pages to get to and the third, the rapidly worsening situation between the US and the Soviet Union that Ryan manages to defuse, happens in the following 200 or so pages. Nothing of the 800 pages up to the explosion makes it into the movie which has been entirely reinvented with only the names of characters from the original story remaining (although some, such as the Russian president, inexplicably have different names). What remains is so unlikely and entirely dumbed down that it is hard not to laugh at this movie. I mean, if you ever see a red and black pair of wires twisted together at the bottom of something like a cigarette dispenser then don't bother with saying OMG, just RUN! Just run for your life and get as far away from that thing as you can!!! Instead of the considerable effort and precision work that went into building the nuclear bomb in the original story, we just see three Russian scientists goofing around and cutting the same frightening twisted red and black wires. This dumbing down of the story continues on right to the final painful moment and tragically leaves out the brilliant stuff. There was even a chapter dedicated to describing the first 30 nanoseconds after the bomb's trigger goes off. It is perhaps one of the most brilliant things I have read and would have made an incredible but also utterly frightening montage on screen.There is no mention of the so-called ""Vatican treaty"" which is the background of the events that unfold, there is no mention of a situation involving a Russian attack submarine and a disabled American missile submarine, no mention of the TV satellites that purely by accident become disabled by the nuclear blast and led authorities to falsely believe it was no terrorist attack, no mention of the bomb's yield being overestimated which also falsely ruled out the terrorist attack.At the time of the movie's release it was said in the media that they changed the terrorists from Arabs to Nazis because it was too close to being something that could actually happen in real life. I never understood this explanation because wasn't that the whole point? Changing the story to something implausible is ridiculous. This sort of story only works if it seems like something that could really happen otherwise the bad guys may as well be fairies.For anyone who has seen the movie and has not read the book, I recommend at least reading the Wikipedia article on the book and compare the plot summary with the movie. I really think this story deserves a do-over perhaps in the form of a miniseries to allow more of the original story to be included. Maybe a studio like Netflix or HBO might like to have a go at it.",The Sum of All Fears

For those who have read the book, skip the movie, unless you are prepared for a movie with more differences in characters, nations, and issues, as the book.

And I stress very loosely. Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan is a ludicrous piece of casting.  After all, Ryan is supposed to be a married, middle aged Deputy Director of the CIA.  And while I really like Morgan Freeman, why does he need to be in every third movie to come out of Hollywood?  Is it in his contract?  In addition to bogus casting the, the plot has been contorted beyond recognition.  Bottom line is, read the book and forget the movie.",The Sum of All Fears

278,Shadow007,Too heavy on visuals and lacking plot cohesion,6,31 August 2002,"I have always been skeptical of books made into moves. More often than not they don't follow the book closely enough and are worse off for it. The Sum of All Fears is a prime example of this.Admittedly SOAF is not Clancy's best novel. There were significant problems with the novel I thought which don't warrant going into here. Anyway the movie seems to have magnified these problems. The main one is the character of Clark. In the novel he is fine but in the movie there seems little point to his character. He does a lot of investigating but little reporting to a higher authority or anything of the sort. He just ran around seeming to have little impact on any of the events or the plot in general. This is emphasised when he goes to see the radioactive poisoning victim. If that wasn't the most goddam useless scene I've ever seen in a movie then I don't know what is.Another gripe I have is with the minor details of the movie. Names for one. Why change Marcus Cabot to William Cabot? Why change Narmanov to Nimerov? There seems little point. Also the neo-nazis are a stupid idea. I know that with current sensitivities the use of Islamic terrorists wouldn't have been a good idea but the neo-nazis were a cheap way out and a stupid idea in my opinion.Overall, a very disappointing movie. 6/10",The Sum of All Fears

It was at the same level of Clear and Present Danger, which was itself not as good as Patriot Games, which was not as good as Hunt for Red October.Affleck does a good job and the dialogue is top-notch as one can expect from a Clancy film.  However, for some reason, the film-makers decided to hold back on the special effects of the nucleur bomb (why I can't explain.. I know I'm not giving anything away because it's shown on the TV commercials.)Additionally, I always find it to be cheap-looking when you can't recognize the uniforms of the football teams who are playing during the movie.. why couldn't they just have suited up players in official NFL regalia such as the Baltimore Ravens rather than two teams that look like they play for small colleges passed off as professionals?At times a little tough to follow, but overall I'd recommend a trip to the theater for this one.",The Sum of All Fears
280,genrommel,"Horrible Fourth Installment In The ""Jack Ryan Series""",1,6 June 2002,"This movie was absolutely too hard for me to watch. There was such little believability to the story, terrible casting and even worse acting. (That last aspect falls to Ben Affleck alone by the way) Perhaps if they would have made an effort to make this movie a prequel instead of a sequel it would have made some sense Ryan and Clarke seem to be about 20 years younger. I guess they got some top secret CIA age regression therapy or something. The concept of Nazi's causing some type of World War III had raised an eyebrow with me at first. But by the end I was dumbfounded! Absolutely nothing was explained! Suppose Russia and the United States did end up nuking each other like mad. Ok thats fine, thats what the Nazi's wanted in this movie, but then what? Are the group of 5 Nazi's in the movie somehow supposed to take over the world then or what? That fact makes the entire premise of the movie absurd, the villain masterminds behind everything have a plan that makes little or no sense! On to Affleck's performance. Let me first say I do like him as an actor. That being said he was just terrible! Part of that was not his fault, the role was lousy, his character seems far more interested in having sex with his girlfriend then finding out about the nuclear bomb plot. He goes so far as to be conflicted about answering the phone because it might be the CIA making him go to work and help stop the nuclear plot. God forbid we interrupt CIA agents in the mist of passion to protect us the nuclear attack. I hope its not like this in the real CIA or we are all in big trouble! Let me say one last thing.

That having been said, this movie was more about the relationship and machismo that leads up to war rather than the actual war. Ben was decent, Morgan always satisfies and the guy that plays the Russian leader was deep and awesome.However, my problem with the movie is it's glitches. The stadium that the president is in is located in Baltimore, so why are the two football teams from Florida and Chicago? Also, Ben walks around at Ground Zero Baltimore, so why doesn't he die of poisoning? Despite the flaws, the plot is excellent with more twists and turns than Justin Timberlake's new hair-do!

285,tcordes,"Not perfect, but satisfying for fans and non-fans alike",9,24 June 2002,"First, I will admit I am a fervent Clancy fan, having read all of his books at least once and seen all the movie adaptations so far.  As a Clancy fan, I say to other Clancy fans: GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  But, of course, that goes without saying -- you've already seen it.From a fan's standpoint, the inconsistencies with the book were a bit irksome during the movie, and I found myself thinking back to the book I last read around 10 years ago.  Nazi's?  An unmarried Ryan?  Looks like Hollywood was liberal with the adaptation.  But it's nothing that we fans can't overlook in order to enjoy another big-screen view of the Ryan saga. And it's not like Hollywood has never mangled details like this before.Second, I think non-fans will also enjoy this movie.  I went with my girlfriend who has never shown much interest in Clancy novels, and she may have enjoyed it more than me due to the lack of any preconceived notions. That said, this movie definitely isn't for everyone!  It's more of an intellectual thriller than a fast-paced action flick.  The action/military scenes are sprinkled conservatively throughout and also, just as in Clancy's novels, there are a lot of light-hearted moments that will make everyone smile.Third, I'd like to add that I went into the movie thinking Affleck was a horrible choice for Ryan.  I would have much preferred to see Ford reprise his role: too old or not!  But in all honesty, he wasn't too bad and surprisingly it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film after the first few minutes.  The rest of the cast was strong and believable.  The direction and technical side was also quite good.  There was a definite mood to the sets, locations and cinematography that effectively conveyed the darkness of the themes being explored.Lastly, I'd like to comment on how bang-on Clancy is with his novels predicting actual events.  After reading Debt of Honor I remember thinking that it was so plausible that it had to happen.  Then September 11...  I hope that political leaders take seriously what Clancy plausibly lays out in Rainbow and Sum and work hard to avert even worse disasters in the future.Bottom line: see the movie if you're a Clancy fan, and see it if you're a non-fan who has some patience and can enjoy a slightly unconventional pace.",The Sum of All Fears

This movie, although it may scare some because of the uncanny parallels it now has to modern American society, is thought provoking and offers some hope in today's world.  The movie is yet another one starring ""Jack Ryan,"" the Tom Clancy hero (this time played by Ben Affleck, which I must say definitely delivered an amazing performance) this time against a threat of a fission bomb placed somewhere on the east coast. The acting in this movie is superb and the character of John Clark is truly one of the most amazing ones in the movie because of the true talent with which the role is done (next to Ben Affleck's performance that is). Although there are some points in which the movie ""just doesn't work,"" such as the fact that Ryan and his girlfriend manage to go through a violent helicopter crash and get thrown across a hospital weapon from the blast, respectively, these things do not detract at all from the movie.  The dialogue is superb, the acting is complete and it is scary (although the latter is probably also in part due to the fact that the theater i was in was evacuated in the middle of the movie because of a fire alarm).  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't get exceedingly frightened about the current political situation and likes a good movie that isn't another mindless piece of dribble.

So yes, they may have changed some things, but who says they can't? Besides, it's really hard to adapt a voluminous book to fit it into a few pages of script; don't let escape those details.Ben Affleck delivers a not-so-bad performance, although I think he could have done better (or some other person, perhaps?).

Not only did Mace Neufeld manage to create some great political scenes that would have seemed corny done any other way, but he also managed to intertwine some tense action into the storyline. I also just love the screenplay: 'Hitler was just stupid. You don't fight Russia and America. You get Russia and America to fight each other. And destroy each other.' And the reference to JFK (the only really sane US President) at the end, matched alongside the great Michael Byrne's acting, is a brilliant way to end a movie. The actual Baltimore explosion and the dying Cabot scene are both powerful moments in the movie, and every actor and actress in it did a wonderful job. I can't wait to see Affleck in another Clancy-adapted movie, and he played Jack Ryan the way I pictured him in the books detailing his early life in the CIA.

Since I did not check the ""contains spoilers"" box, I am obligated to not reveal which scene I am referring to. So I will just say that since the sum of all fears is supposed to be the first in the series, this one scene that I am referring to led me to believe that the producers of the film overlooked a major script flaw.

298,Nathan_Fisher,Best movie I've ever seen,10,3 June 2002,"There are those out there who don't get the paradox, and I'll briefly explain. Clancy wanted Affleck to play Ryan, so he re-wrote this to be a prequel of sorts. He used the underlying Premise of SOAF to go back in time, re-develop the character, and create more adventures. He was limited by the Ryan in the novel SOAF because it is unrealistic to have a director of the CIA to be running around everywhere. Imagine that Hunt, Patriot Games, and C&P danger haven't happened yet.I was one of the people who thought Affleck was a horrible choice - until I saw this performance. For once in his career, Affleck gets a meaty character and is multi-dimensional.  I felt the supporting cast was A+ and the confusion ensuing something like this is real. The Jack Clark character is top notch. I love him in this no-nonsense role.As far as the movie goes, it has every quality I look for.  Character development, plot development, good script, and things that make sense. Too many action movies let you see a 3-2-1 countdown and stop it at 1.2 seconds to build fake suspense.  In addition, it had drama, sadness, humor, action, violence, intelligence, special effects - all of which make this terrific.I find this movie to be the solid building blocks of a new franchise. USA today (2 stars out of 4) said that it took too long to develop and criticized that the director of the CIA was ignoring his cell phone during the football game.  I found that the time to develop the characters was WELL worth it.  Too many action films today are shoot-em-up and build fake suspense. This suspense was real and kept me on the edge of my seat. I hate action films (like ""Don't Say a Word"" for instance), where at the end the protagonist has the advantage and doesn't shoot the bad guy because of moral ambiguity. Then, somehow, the bad guy gets a gun and the good guy is ""justified"" to shoot him. In this film, I LOVED that they hunted the bad guys down like dogs and showed no mercy. This is believable. This gives great satisfaction to a viewer who has just seen literally millions of people killed.Another facet about the movie that gave this credibility was the fact it didn't try to get credibility.  It didn't try to convince the viewers that ""millions died"" to get an effect. It didn't rattle off all of Affleck's credentials like so many movies do in the first 10 minutes. He wasn't called ""Dr. Ryan"" until he met the Russian president 50 minutes into it. I loved that he was ambiguous towards commitment with his gf, it shows real fear. However, the blast made him suddenly realize what was important and was a driving factor in his commitment. More movies should try to downplay credentials - you end up giving the character more credit.  As a point of reference, I look at Seagal movies. In the first 15 minutes, he had to be some special forces guru who knew everything. Why couldn't he just be an average guy who overachieves like Bruce Willis in Die Hard?  Seagal's career is weary at best now because he has an ego with his scripts.  Viewers like to relate to over-achievers, and I feel Affleck did a GREAT job playing an average guy who worked hard and is over-achieving and growing in strength as the ante is raised in global war.  The fact his character evolves to a stronger Ryan in the movie is great cinema.",The Sum of All Fears
299,markol0,disappointing,5,12 June 2002,"What a load of crap. It was worked up to be such an interesting movie in the previews, but turned out to be a disappointing pg-13 politically correct loser.Hollywood obviously does not want to pss off the arab countries by making them the vialins, remember we need to keep the oil prices down. Instead lets make the Nazis evil. They are all dead, so no one cares. Of course the nuclear adversary is once again Russia (who else?). Cheesy, overdone, boring, are the only adequate adjectives in this case. Oh and lets not forget to make fun of Yeltsin for his alcoholism while we're at it. The Russian president has to speak English, but not the other way around, because after all, America is number 1 right?There are so many flaws in the movie, besides the overwhelming amount of obscene political correctness. Critical mass of plutonium cannot be handled by nakid hands, besides being heavy enough to prohibit being carried in one hand. Cell phones and PDA working immediately after a nuclear explosion? Give me a break. You would have to shield them with 2 inches of lead for that to happen. Oh and one more thing. After the Israeli military lost a nuclear weapon, you think they would just leave it out in the desert for some idiot to find?The movie is a joke.",The Sum of All Fears
300,mafioso,THE Bomb!,8,2 June 2002,An amazing film not to be missed.  The Sum of All Fears is the story of a realistic scenario of a nuclear bomb detonated on US soil.  Only scary if you let it go to your head.  If you just sit back and watch the movie unfold you will love it.  Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman are both wonderful in their roles.  I could say so many great things about this movie but there's just one thing I really wanted to comment on.  The 30 second or so nuclear bomb explosion that happens in the movie is so spine tingling and hair raising that I believe these 30 seconds alone are worth the admission price of the movie!  I would pay full admission just to watch the explosion over and over and over again.  The special effects made the explosion look so real and the sound absolutely shook the theatre.  I'm looking forward to cranking the volume at home(I'll put the cats and dogs out first!) when this one is released on DVD (but I know it just won't compare to the theatre sound)  I can already see myself skipping straight to the nuclear bomb track on the DVD just for fun from time to time.  WOW is a massive understatement in describing the explosion.  But seriously there's more to this movie than just the explosion.  You will absolutely love the way the movie unfolds.  A great way to spend a couple hours.,The Sum of All Fears

The girlfriend reminded me greatly of the wife in ""Imposter"", however, still strong. My favorite performance was Liev Schrieber (sp?); as a fan of him from the Screams, he pulled off a strong minor performance. ?Semi-spoiler?: One great thing about the movie, was that really, it was two movies in one. I had my friend check his watch, and it was about an hour and 10 minutes in when the nuke exploded, and then there was about an hour of Jack desperately trying to end the brewing war. If you just added filler to both and cut them apart, they'd both be pretty good movies in themselves (although the beginning, far better). One thing that was inexplicably barely mentioned was the radiation. It seemed that as long as you didnt hit your head and kill yourself, you were perfectly normal and fine. The president barely made it out of the stadium, yet he survives perfectly fine, except for the bump on his head. Odd. Still, a fine movie.",The Sum of All Fears

Usually during every movie, even action films, there is a spot in the movie that is boring. During this movie I did not feel bored during a single scene. Many people are complaining about Ben Affleck playing Ryanm, but I can not think of a person that could have played the CIA analyst any better. i would have to agree with others that Harrison Ford is way to old for the role. He's almost sixty!! All I can say now is that everyone has different opinions on the movie, but it was entertaining throughout and I highly reccomend it.",The Sum of All Fears
305,No_Future,"Could have been a 9/10, if only...",7,18 August 2002,"After reading a brief plot-outline, I decided to watch this movie in a theatre. I was expecting an easy and smooth action-flick for two hours, but TSOAF definately exceeded my expectations. The movie raises a very serieus global issue, and the possibly devastating effect the actions of only a few rogues can have. Which is not to say that the movie is flawless though, but explaining this points requires me to use spoilers.<SPOILERS!>From the start, the scene is set for your average action-flick; a lost bomb finds its way to a number of people poised on setting the stage for WW-III. The acting, the scene, the way in which the CIA is deceived etc. are not bad, but not great either; I made me expect the average plot in which the good guys stop the bomb at the stadium from going off 3 second before it would have exploded.The point at which the movie starts to exceed the level of average Hollywood movies is the 5- to 7-second areal still-shot of Baltimore: a powerful yet subtle hint at what's going to happen. It made me wonder: ""Would Hollywood really have the guts to...?"". And they did. Being a physicist, I must say that I was pleased to see a technically rather accurate depiction of a nuclear explosion: it is absolutely silent, until the shockwave arrives (the shockwave travels faster than sound, so indeed things must be silent before it arrives).As I stated in the one-line summary, from this point on the movie could have become a 9/10, if only... That is: if only the story would have proceeded in a realistic way from this point on. The realistic scenario would have been a full-scale global nuclear shoot-out. In this way, the point about how fragile our world really is would have come across in a much stronger way. I do understand Hollywood's (or Clancy's) need to entertain a large audience, since in the end they make their living by doing so. But please, this could have been done in another way than the all-too-American bs in which this One Righteous Man Saves The World All On His Own! The scenario which the people in Air Force One think of: nuking Russia's ICBMs to make them back off, possibly at the expense of a limited number of USA cities, would have done perfectly as an ending: the world would not have been destroyed completely, yet a very strong message would have been conveyed!In addition, I very much agree with many of the other customers, who rightfully scorn Hollywood for not having the guts to follow the book, and depict the arabs as the bad guys: not because all arabs are bad guys, but because given the events of last year, this would have conveyed the point even more strongly. Yes, this would have been shocking! Yes, this would have caused people to walk out on the movie, too shocked to watch more! But it would have been realistic and strong!.If only.... A missed opportunity!",The Sum of All Fears
306,Werrf,"Flawed, but a good effort",8,6 September 2002,"I've been putting off seeing this film, as I was afraid I would be disappointed.  Luckily, I wasn't.Ben Affleck is convincing in the role of the 'accidental hero' Ryan - you never get the feeling that he's setting out to be a hero, just that he's in the right place at the right time to make a difference, and that he's just doing what he can.The first half of the film is interesting - we see enough of the Bomb Plot to know what's going on, without going into the intricate details that so often slow the books down.  It's interesting seeing the little snippets we get here and there from the good guys POV.  There's a real humanity to Ryan (being teased by his boss, looked down on by the bigwigs), as well as a sense of being caught up in events he can't really control.  This is good.The second half of the film is a lot tenser.  The handling of the detonation was good - no grisly, slow-motion shots of people being blown apart, just focusing on the main characters.  The aftermath was perhaps a little overdone (Ryan driving through the flaming city came out of nowhere - it was rather offputting), but luckily it didn't last long, and soon enough we were into a tense potboiler.  The handling of the growing crises was believable - given what we knew about the US and Russian Presidents, each decision was true to character, and it was easy to see each move being misinterpreted on the other side.  Eminently believable.The only major problem I had with the crisis at the end was the Backfire attack on the US Carrier.  In the book, this role was filled by tanks stationed in Berlin, a situation which obviously had to be rectified for the film.  However, the attack was simply unbelievable - the US Navy has practiced this exact scenario too often for them to be taken so completely off-guard, especially after what had just happened in Baltimore.  Still, it looked good.I was very pleased not to see rampant Americanism running through the film. It could so easily have become ""America good, being reasonable, Russia bad, being nasty"", but if anything, Russia was the defender, and America the aggressor.  What could easily have become overbearing became tension-building instead.I can't rate this 10/10, because it wasn't perfect, but I'd say it rates a solid 8.",The Sum of All Fears
307,Tanjaza,the sum of bad explanations,2,29 April 2005,"The Sum of All Fears is nothing but a sum of bad explanations to keep the lame plot going. To be afraid we need something to be afraid of. In the film it is a bomb, but that's not strong enough, so let it be a nuclear bomb. Better. In addition to that we need someone who owns this bomb. But let's face it, one single person is not scary unless he has his hands on your throat, so we better take a group of scary people. This group is planning to attack the United States and, of course, the government is trying everything to prevent this from happening. We are to believe it's the Russians planning an attack, but we know that already. It's always the Russians and it's becoming pretty boring. It was time for something new. Enter Nazis. (They are not really new, are they?) One of the basic questions is how they got that nuclear bomb. (Damn, I knew we forgot something while writing the script!) The film starts with a Israeli jet flying over a desert (I think it was Sinai, right?). The pilot is busy fussing with a picture of his family and is then downed (surprise!). I find this rather unconvincing. No pilot is looking at a picture while flying! Who is to believe that? Then all this ""It's the Russians, no, it's not the Russians!"" is getting on my nerves.There are some funny moments (the T-Shirt saying ""I am a bomb technician, if you see me running, try to catch up!"") and some nice visuals, but the story makes no sense.If you don't want to waste your time, don't watch it.",The Sum of All Fears

He is at his best in the action scenes, but not quite convincing as the analyst Ryan.The quality of the remainder of the cast, however, keeps the movie on track, in spite of some deviations from the written story. Morgan Freeman, Liev Schreiber (who should have been the ""new"" Jack Ryan), James Cromwell and a host of other experienced performers do a great job escalating the tension and making the ""certain"" ending not so certain.",The Sum of All Fears
309,Da Fokka,Another excellent Jack Ryan movie,8,24 August 2002,"Being a huge fan of both the Jack Ryan novels and the Jack Ryan movies, I awaited this movie with great anticipation. I have to say that I was a bit sceptical of Ben Affleck playing the role of Jack Ryan but fortunately he didn't disappoint me. The actually amount of action scenes is fairly limited and even the nuclear explosion, which for many directors would be an excuse to unleash millions of dollars of CG is displayed quite briefly. The action scenes are there for the sake of the story, and not for the sake of action and they help building up the tension really well. Like the other Ryan movies (The hunt for Red October, Patriot Games and Clear and present danger), the story is a simplified version of the novel but the movie tells the story of the escalating conflict of two superpowers spiralling towards a full-scale nuclear war remarkably well. The movie isn't exactly true to the novel but you can't expect a 800-page novel to be reproduced truthfully in 2 hours, and the main theme of the novel is captured way better than in, for instance, Clear and Present Danger. The age of Jack Ryan is inconsistent with both the novels and the previous movies but if you're willing to set this aside you Ryan fans will love this one.

But Ben Affleck is no Harrison Ford. And that is the least of the criticisms this movie deserves. Poor Affleck struggles with a plot that becomes more far-fetched by the minute whereas other Jack Ryan films kept the intensity at a believable level of execution.It is hard to believe the writer and director of Field of Dreams made this movie. These two films are worlds apart. Having Sum of All Fears on your CV is something you'd want to keep quiet.At the beginning there were tell-tale signs of absurdity when a trained fighter pilot carrying a nuclear bomb bends down to pick up a picture of his wife and child that had blown off the dashboard (he was racing over desert terrain at the time), momentarily taking his hand off the steering wheel and his eyes off the landscape. Naturally, the plane crashes and you can almost hear Homer Simpson shout 'Doh!'. If this scene was not lifted off Airplane 2 or somesuch movie then I'm a nuclear scientist.After many such ridiculous twists and turns, by the time it came to the bomb potentially going off, about an hour and ten minutes into the film, you were actually preying for the blast and perhaps a fast exit from the cinema.At the end, when the crazed arms dealer is waving his hands to classical music (actually Nessun Dorma but known in Europe as the World Cup music from Italy 1990 - another badly researched hilarious touch from the Hollywood team) - the scene is lifted from Silence of the Lambs.There is very little originality in the movie except to say that it's almost in a class of its own, an extremely lowly class - the Hollywood blockbuster has sunk to a new level.",The Sum of All Fears

Unfortunately, this story takes the Jack Ryan character from the ranks of American hero to unbelievable.

The Israelis would never have left a nuke lying around in the Golan Heights.  If they sent up a jet with a nuke on board and it got shot down, they would have immediately sent in a recovery team in order to prevent that bomb from falling into the wrong hands.  I don't care if they were at war, that's a risk they can't afford to take.2. Given the events of September 11, 2001 the US will never say anything to Russia about what they do to the Chechneyans.  If the Russians were to nuke them, poison them, etc. We will look the other way, as the Russians fight their war on terror, we will be free to fight ours.3. How the hell did the Russians know where our Stealth Bombers were?  I thought the whole idea of a stealth bomber is that you can't see it on radar, which is what makes it so dangerous.4.

What a Waste.,5,1 June 2002,"For context, I have not read any Clancy books and the only other Clancy movie that I have seen is The Hunt for Red October, which is a great movie.In contrast, The Sum of All Fears is typical Hollywood crap and I gave it a 5 out of 10.  I expected to see a quasi-espionage film with some intrigue but instead they gave us a disjointed, jumpy action flik with poor plot development and little mystery.  It could have been much better.  They could have allowed the main character to piece together a complex, hard-to-decipher puzzle, letting us piece it together with him along the way.  What we got was a silly, contrived action movie with overly stereotyped characters and a dose of political correctness.Does anyone really believe that the perpetrators of such a horrific crime would not be radical Muslim Arabs?  According to other commenters, in the book it was the Arabs, but to keep from offending Muslim audiences the villians were magically transformed into Neo-Nazis instead.  Morgan Freeman got to play the ""rational, wise old black man"" role which is getting old and in his case, cliched.  The cookie-cutter American politicans were portrayed as being somewhat dumb and rather unreasonable.I could have thought of the entire plot and script on my own!  This movie offered nothing--no plot quirks or intrigue--that I cannot or would not imagine without the movie makers' help.  The movie carried the pretense of being quasi-intellectual (political)--I expected some political intrigue and complex plot development--but instead it's just a barely intelligible action film designed to bring in box office dollars from an undiscerning public.I don't believe Ebert gave it 3 1/2 out of 4 stars.

The victims, of course, are burnt to a crisp, writhing, dying, screaming, pleading but she is ""Holly Go Lightly"" barking off orders to other nurses.And that's just one of the many flaws in this ridiculous film.

James Cromwell (the farmer guy Babe the talking pig pictures) badly plays our U.S. President (heads up here: they didn't go for a George Dubya lookalike even though Cromwell's character fits the Dubya personality perfectly) but what is so dumb is that Ben Affleck literally takes over the presidency with only we the viewer seeing him do it. The film's director couldn't really let the world know that Ben was in control of the free world.   And then there's the guy who knows and sees everything at all times and who follows us all the way to the end of the film and even suprises Ben & lover with a wedding gift before they've even set the wedding date.

319,Petah2NC,The Sum of All Fears = Nothing,3,31 May 2002,"It is impossible to review a movie like ""The Sum of All Fears"" without referring to the events of last September.  The images up on the screen will take you back there -- and probably not pleasantly so -- but so may what ISN'T on the screen:  namely, realism.  We, as an audience, now unfortunately have an idea of what really happens after a catastrophic event like the one depicted in this film.  Presidents address nations, military responses are contemplated in matters of days and weeks, not mere minutes, and we feel, for the most part, that we are in capable hands.In other words, thank God our country is not in the hands of the characters portrayed in this mess.For a man whose stories are supposedly ultra-realistic due to his connections within the government and the military, Tom Clancy's ""The Sum of All Fears"" is shockingly inept.  The fact that none of the aforementioned responses to a national tragedy are never touched on in here is not a factor of desiring action over subtle drama, but of shoddy storytelling.  For something that is supposed to be chillingly plausible, ""The Sum of All Fears"" ultimately comes off as a James Bond wanna-be.Witness some of the dialog:  ""This conversation never took place!"" ""If I don't talk to the president now, there may not BE a tomorrow!"" ""I'm not worried about the ones who have 27,000 nuclear warheads, I'm worried about the man who has one!"" and others of that ilk.  Do people in government really talk like this?  They do in spy movies, and this one does a good job of stealing every hoary cliche one can think of, topped of with a hackneyed, predictable plot that has so many holes and non-sensical moments (a key advisor to the president suffers a near heart attack halfway through, only to appear miraculously fine moments later -- yeeeeaaahh) that someone should have packed mothballs with the reel.  It doesn't help, by the way, that whenever Jack Ryan says something, we know that it's gospel, because Ryan is always right.  Bye bye suspense!Ben Affleck does a fairly capable job in the Ryan role, although he still looks more comfortable smoking a doobie in a Kevin Smith movie.  Morgan Freeman is completely wasted as Colby, the man who, for some unknown reason, drags Ryan into the whole mess then seems to want him to shut up the whole time.  Several other talented actors suffer the same wasteful fate, including Bruce McGill and Ron Rifkin (so good on ABC's ""Alias"").  The only ones who truly come out unscathed are James Cromwell as the president and Liev Schreiber as Clancy favorite John Clark, who steals what few scenes he is in.From its ludicrous premise of a bomb surviving a heat-seeking missile attack in Egypt, only to be resurrected years later and sold on the black market, to its Godfather-like conclusion (yes, another rip-off), ""The Sum of All Fears"" adds up to zero.",The Sum of All Fears
320,tomm4004,Sum of All Fears adds up to Nil.,3,1 June 2002,"(this review contains many SPOILERS)There's a scene about half-way through The Sum of All Fears where CIA Director Cabot takes a phone call from Jack Ryan while attending the Superbowl. He'd sent Ryan on an important mission concerning a potentially missing Russian nuke. Ryan is calling to tell him that ""the bomb is in play."" Now, perhaps the words (if he heard them) lead Cabot to believe that one of the QBs was going to toss a long one, because, unable to hear over the rowdy crowd, he hangs up!The logic of the film had been steadily spiraling downward at that point, but that scene made it crash land harder than Ryan's helicopter in a subsequent scene. Why would the CIA director simply hang up? Ryan does call back, and is able to relay his message to Cabot, whose reaction is to look up at the dome ceiling as if the bomb is going to drop through - or perhaps he was watching the winning field goal being kicked.The rest of Sum reminded me squarely of Thirteen Days, but only in content, certainly not in quality. Thirteen Days makes this movie look particularly inept. The story shifts between Ryan's completely implausible exploits - why does he go to a warehouse on the Baltimore docks expecting the bad guys to be hanging around after a nuclear blast, for instance - to the conflict between the President and his freaked-out staff on Air Force One. The idea in the latter was to show the panic and potentially bad decision-making that could result from such a crisis, but it was handled so poorly, with such ridiculous dialogue and unbelievable acting that it made no dramatic impact. At one point, someone has a heart attack (to which someone says he has a heart condition - no kidding) but the consequences of that are never known. In fact, no consequences are ever made known, and too many important details are mentioned but not shown.Ryan's method of talking down the Russian President is comical, and an insult to the audience's intelligence, and is predicated by his having met the President during an odd photo shoot in the Kremlin. The Russian President doesn't trust the American President, but he trusts a junior CIA agent who once wrote a paper on him.

I see what Tom Clancy is trying to say, but as usual he does it with all the subtlety of a brick over the head and it doesn't help that in trying to compress all he has to say, into a less than two hour movie, it all just becomes confused. Frederick Forsyth has the same problem when transferred onto the big screen - although at least Freddy is plausible and has some real experience with what he writes about. The CIA is just a little too slick here - love how those cell phones just keep on working... anywhere! Affleck is no Harrison Ford, no, no, no, or even a Baldwin for that matter. God help us all if we're relying on him (or his acting) to save the world. He's about a three on the cute scale for me - how anyone could give him a twelve is beyond me. Freeman is wonderful as usual. The tension is well portrayed in the situation rooms, but I can't help but think even a George Bush has more backbone than the President in this film. This is a really bad film, which is a pity because they could have done so much better - even with Affleck.",The Sum of All Fears

Hearing about this movie made be think this even before I saw it, but that's just because I knew the chronology of the novels wouldn't be followed as it should.  The movie as a whole was very good, but I've been long awaiting the next Tom Clancy novel adapted to movie.  I was leery of Ben Affleck being cast as Jack Ryan, but it fit pretty well with the movie, and Morgan Freeman was a great addition to the Jack Ryan story.  The problem I have with the movie is that it neither follows the timeline of Clancy's novels nor an adapted-for-movie timeline created by only a few of the novels getting chosen to be movies. The novel is older than the other's made into movies (PATRIOT GAMES & CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER), so it makes sense for Jack Ryan to be younger... but the novel is also about a different time of unrest in world history.  This would have all made sense in the movie if it had indeed been a prequel, but it isn't.  The story tries to combine an early chapter in Ryan's life with a modern story/timeline.   The vagueness of references to the other movies is a way of drawing attention away from this discrepancy, so you can just get into the movie.   It's a good watch, though, and relevant to current world affairs.  It's exciting, suspenseful, well written, and despite the inaccuracies with the timeline, it's pretty accurate in it's technical aspects & fun to watch.",The Sum of All Fears

It has a similar effect to Rocky II (you know he's getting up, but you still worry) or the vastly stronger-across-the-boards 'Thirteen Days' in that the subject matter is well used and complimented by the cast and crew to strike home with most viewers.'Sum' has many strong moments, a few memorable quotes and throw-away jokes, as well as some superb character acting from the supporting cast, but--while intense--it lacks some subtleties that even the previous Jack Ryan adventures contained.

340,clevanator,"Great book, horrible, HORRIBLE adaptation (SPOILERS)",1,8 July 2002,"Let me preface my comments by saying that I loved Clancy's book when I first read it ten years ago.  It was a gripping page-turner, and a marvelously intricate work, building suspense in layers.  I've since re-read it several times.I realistically expected that elements of the massive tome would have to be changed or condensed for the screen version.  But so much is changed, and so many critical elements removed, that it hardly resembles its novel origins. As a result I find it difficult to believe that Tom Clancy had much creative control over this effort, though he's credited as ""Executive Producer"".First, for some inexplicable reason, this movie jumps away from previous Clancy continuity by completely revamping the character of Jack Ryan. Rather than a middle aged CIA administrator, Ryan is now a young handsome PhD with little Washington experience.  Apparently this is to boost the ""chick-flick"" quotient of this outing, as it adds nothing tangible to the film, and only detracts from the continuity that had been built to this point.  There's even a scene where Kathy is asked how ""cute"" Ryan is on a 1-10 scale, and she says a ""12"".  Ugh! They had time to include this garbage, yet skip vital character development later in the film?Yet, even worse, this Ryan is the Uber-Ryan.  Yes, the man is everywhere, and involved in virtually every action sequence in the film.  He finds the bomb lab in Russia (and saves Clark, CLARK, for crying out loud, shouldn't it be the OTHER way around???), races to Baltimore in a helicopter to warn President Fowler(who in yet another huge change is caught in the blast himself) he gets caught in the nuclear blast(and hardly gets his hair mussed, how cliche!), he personally sifts through the rubble of Baltimore for evidence (another inexplicable change, as Denver was the city nuked in the book, then goes on for a cliched confrontation with the terrorists (who are VERY poorly developed character-wise, totally unlike the book) mano y mano in a darkened Baltimore warehouse.   Oh, and I almost forgot, there was the obligatory (and oh so overused) Hollywood ""death"" scene where Ryan (again, Ryan personally) kneels at the bed of Morgan Freeman as he expires in a ""tearful"" sequence.  Yes, it was painful but not in the way intended.I thought Clancy's books sometimes stretched the believablity of Ryan's capabilities to the breaking point, yet this goes way beyond anything Clancy has previously done.   It's Super-Ryan to the rescue, more 007 than distinguished, cerebral CIA analyst, even though he supposedly had little if any experience in espionage, forensics, or any of that.  It is very cliched, and very tiresome to watch, at least for anyone that's actually read the books.One of the best parts of the novel was the realism.  Reading it, you really believed that the plot Clancy put in motion could occur.  Not this movie. Believable Islamic terrorists were replaced with cartoonish middle-aged white european neo-Nazis who make stock Hitler-loving speeches that any avid movie-goer has heard a million times before.  Dr. Evil would love these guys.  They even got to kill one of their own rank, ala Dr. Evil, after he experienced the convenient cinematic ""crisis of concience"".  You could see it coming a mile away!  I guess that's so we can understand these men are serious and mean ""business""Oh and on the subject of business, since the typical european Neo-Nazi is young, skinheaded, devoted, but not terribly affluent these Nazis were conveniently well-to-do businessmen with the financial assets and experience to put their scheme in motion.  Is this Tom Clancy or James Bond?  I guess its not ""politically correct"" to feature the actual type of real world Middle Eastern ""gentlemen"", with the aid of foreign government sponsorship who even now are striving, again in reality, to make weapons of mass destruction to use against us?  I guess its always ""safe"" to once again bash caucasian conservative-appearing men in business suits.  Whatever the reason, its another major plot element from the book down the tubes.On the subject of the bomb;  there was a great deal of detail in the book about the bomb that was completely overlooked in the movie.  For example, in the book, the bomb was originally intended to be a multi-stage, ie, HYDROGEN bomb.  It fizzled.  The original yield was overestimated by twenty fold by military analysts because of reflection of the snow, and other factors. The President's advisors didn't think terrorists could build a multi-stage weapon, thus the suspicion was immediately upon the Russians. It was only after frantic detective work that the true yield of the bomb was discovered, and it put Ryan on the proper track AND gave him leverage to help defuse the situation(no pun intended).  It's a common worry that terrorist groups might get ahold of a low yield fission ""suitcase"" bombs, yet right from the start in the movie no one, including the President, suspects terrorists!Another fond memory I have of the book is that Clancy took us to the very brink of Armageddon where the US and Russia were nearly in a shooting war because of the misinterpreted size of the bomb, and the tank battle that the German terrorists cause to happen in Berlin.  Yet here, the Russians attack and virtually destroy a US nuclear carrier, we bomb a Russian airbase, and we're still standing at that brink.  Somehow, I think if events got that far, there'd be no turning back.  Clancy seemed to know that when he wrote the book;  he seems to have forgotten it here though.These are just a few of the major problems with this film.  The pacing is bad;  one minute the bomb is still being constructed, and a few minutes later its already placed in Baltimore and about to explode, with the cliche of Ryan hot on the trail, trying to warn the President.  In the book, the bomb catches everyone completely off-guard, but not here, ANOTHER irritating change.  There is also very little character development, the President's motivations are poorly understood, the paranoia of Fowler over the new Russian President's motives was poorly developed, etc etc.

341,David V,"It's not the warfare, but the THREAT of warfare...",10,29 September 2002,"This was really a very good movie illustrating the way a tragedy can very nearly lead the super-powers of the world to outright nuclear warfare. The only part that I didn't agree with was in the beginning, where an Israeli fighter jet carrying a nuke gets shot down, and the nuke is never recovered. I would expect the Israelis to know exactly where there plane went down and quickly retrieve their weapon.  That said, the path the weaponry and terrorists follow has been proven to be very accurate.  This is a well thought out story showing how uncomfortably easy it could be to get a weapon into the U.S. and detonate it.  It also shows that Russia is not the threat we Americans really need to be worried about, but smaller bands of extremists.  Clancy used clever twists as usual to make it perfectly logical why things HAD to happen the way they did.  When the bomb detonated under the football stadium in downtown Baltimore, it was this surreal, and rather sickening feeling of ""This isn't real, it has to be a nightmare"" and was all too familiar.  They explain why the blast is able to send out enough force to damage buildings all through the city, without completely leveling it, or even putting off that much radiation, that it was an incredibly small bomb. Even that makes sense, as a terrorist wouldn't smuggle an ICBM into the country.  In the end, this movie has far less to do with the blowing anything up, as the real struggle is to get the two super-powers to stand down before World War Three is started, since their open hostility for each other has made it so easy for them to be puppeted into conflict.  This was a great movie for people who like high-stakes political intrigue movies, like Crimson Tide, and all of the actors involved are stellar.",The Sum of All Fears

What do these people have to gain from trying to start a war, as it isn't a religious belief? The film never explains any character's motivations, except that everyone either wants to save their country and their president, even on their death bed, or they want to blow up america. It was also flatly directed, attempting some form of style (no wonder it's Phil Alden Robinson's first film in ten years), which only managed to irritate, and STILL that American anti-smoking message gets through, because, as this film wants you to believe, only neo-fascists who kill innocent people smoke.

There is no way that Israel (or any other country to which such a thing might have happened) would have not moved heaven and earth to retrieve that bomb.Since that bomb is the Maguffin of the film, one has to suspend disbelief regarding the triggering incident.

I just wasn't prepared to buy Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan. Based on what I have seen of his other work, I didn't think he'd have it in him.I take it back, all of it; he was tremendous!  Affleck is a completely believable CIA analyst/reluctant action hero, and with such a cast as this one he absolutely rose to the occasion.  He even brought to this character the charm and occasionally goofy charisma seen in some of his other roles.I felt this guy really could be the same fellow as Alec Baldwin's or Harrison Ford's Jack Ryans, despite the slightly incongruous timeline with a movie set in present day and he being years younger than the last time we saw him (I can get over it if you can).  Besides, a younger Jack Ryan means we can watch him for years to come without following him right into the old folk's home or having modern spy movies taking place in the sixties.  How much fun would that be if Hollywood couldn't take advantage of modern military technology and current hi-tech communications?  (Apologies, Mr. Ford, of course I am referring to Mr. Ryan's age and not yours personally.)I don't want to give one moment of this movie away, but there was one teeny section that I felt ran a little slow (or maybe I just had had too much caffeine to sit still) but it picked right back up and changed directions once more and I was hooked again!I have not read the book (yet), so I can't speak to how true the movie remains to the original story, but that in itself is not a deterrent to seeing a movie (for me, anyway).  I will tell you that I've heard the terrorists were updated to the faction they were because the original (6-year-old!) book had Muslim religious extremists -- perhaps hitting a little too close to home for an afternoon's entertainment in 2002.

It dawned on me while watching this that we have returned to the nuke scare I grew up with (I'm a baby-boomer)in the 50's, only now, since 9/11, the scare is real.  For viewers who might drool in anticipation to see the effects of a nuclear explosion you will be disappointed. Even ""Atomic Train"" and ""The Day After"" deliver more along that line.  Rather, Sum of All Fears is a thriller along the lines of ""War Games.""  I know the paid critics are going to tear apart Ben Affleck's performance, but I found it one of his best efforts. As a wet-behind-the-ears CIA agent, he is believable. Morgan Freeman, too, is fine.  However, the problem with the rest of the cast--especially those in uniform--is that they are all well-known character actors.

However, it is based upon a book.  The concept of the two are the same, but the movie departs from the book in many details.  The other three movies stay relatively true to the books, and they are generally consistent with one another.  I can find no way to make this movie consistent with any of the books or with the other movies.  I'm curious how Tom Clancy as executive producer felt about this movie.  He should know better than anyone else that this movie is inconsistent with everything that came before it.I enjoyed the movie, but I was constantly bothered by the dissimilarities. I had heard a few things about it, and I had seen trailers for it, so I was actually shocked at the start when it appeared to hold true to the book. It quickly strayed.  Jack Ryan's personal and professional lives are on a VERY different level than in the book.  Jack was powerful (in all books but Patriot Games) and married with children (in all the books).  By the time The Sum of All Fears was written, Jack had acquired high status.  To turn him into a pee-on again and to make him single is like creating a new character.  He becomes much more like Clark/Kelly.  Perhaps it's time to do one of the Clark books...Much of the activity surrounding the bomb itself was off by a bit.  The source for the plutonium was the same, but it was used by two different groups, for different purposes, exploded in different locations, and the explosion was weak for two different reasons.I'm not trying to say that the movie was bad.

If you look at his innocence and his determination, I think that does ""grow into"" a Ford type character, as well as even the Baldwin character.  I am fond of Mr Affleck anyway, but have not thought much of most of his recent material, but this should relaunch him as a great fun star and successor to the Tom Cruise ilk at least.I also remember Harrison Ford's early movies and we thought he would remain a lightweight too.....but look what happened!!Any way, well worth the entertainment dollar, and safe for most kids, but they probably will not understand it until 12 at least.",The Sum of All Fears

It hasn't even been nine months since the most devastating civilian massacre in our nation's history, and Hollywood has the balls to choose four days after Memorial Day to release a stupid popcorn crowd-pleaser about an even more horrific terrorist attack.... It's hard to describe just how dirty and sickened The Sum of All Fears made me feel. Has this sort of tragedy already become fodder for senseless entertainment? Is it really okay to kill off 200,000 innocent people in the middle of a silly action picture and then try to leave us cheering at the end? I understand the film was already in production when the WTC slaughter occurred, but was it really too late to ask for a rewrite?It's downright impossible to watch the chaos and destruction of the film's Super Bowl sequence without terrible memories of last fall flooding back to the surface--all sorts of horrific associations and dark feelings the film has not earned.""Obviously, even an event the magnitude of September 11 wasn't enough to effect any sort of change in Hollywood.

It has the president being injured in a helicopter crash cause by a nuclear bomb, it has the Russians and Americans trying to convince each other that they're not trying to start a war, all the while escalating to the next level of preparation. It even has the last ditch effort to save the day by contacting the Russian premier directly when our own forces will not listen to reason.I highly recommend this movie to anybody who can find a copy of it, it's definitely worth seeing, especially if you felt 'sum of all fears' could have been done so much better.",The Sum of All Fears
360,jeckle,"Almost fair on its own, but...",4,10 June 2002,"To begin with, I did not like this movie.  That being said, I do not think it was a bad film.  Rather, the plot of the film splits off from the previous Jack Ryan movies to the point that I wonder how they are going to bring Clancy's other books to film?  What about Executive Orders where Ryan's the president?  Or Debt Of Honor where Ryan is the National Security Advisor about to become Vice President briefly before becoming President!? Both of which immediately follow Sum Of All Fears.  These three books are more woven in their plots than any of Clancy's previous works and I think messing with the timeline of Ryna's life/career virtually prevents them from making any believable film version of Debt or Execuitive Orders.  What about Bear & The Dragon?  That book was great - how is it going to be put to film believably?  Ben Affleck as the President!!??I see now that Clancy's new book, Red Rabbit covers Ryan's debriefing of Cardinal (from Cardinal of the Kremlin) in which he learns of a plot to kill the Pope.  This new adventure appears to have been written so that it can be portrayed by a younger Jack Ryan as it takes place between Patriot Games and Clear & Present Danger.  This brings up another problem: now that we have established Ryan's relationship with John Clark, will his character be in the next movie?  Considering that later in Ryan's life (in Clear & Present Danger) Ryan will meet Clark again seemingly for the first time, is Ryan just going to keep meeting the character and not remember all those previous times he met/worked with him?  Are they ever going to make a Rainbow Six movie?  If so, how will they explain Ryan's influence in getting the group started considering he's now just some new guy at the CIA who got the director's ear before he died!?Being a big fan of Tom Clancy and the storyline he has created with Jack Ryan, John Clark, Chavez, Pres. Fowler, etc., I was incredibly disappointed with the movie.  Standing on it's own, The Sum Of All Fears is OK at best. When the proverbial stuff hits the fan, it's kind of lack luster and not really gripping at all.  You don't get the power struggle that was evident in the book between Ryan and the National Security Advisor.  The nuclear blast was a real special effects letdown, especially after the CGI spectacle that was Pearl Harbor!  Everyone but Affleck were believable if a little flat in their parts.  I have never warmed up to Affleck as an actor.  His character doesn't change from movie to movie.  When he says, ""A neo-fascist..."", his youth really shows and it's hard to believe him as the former Marine/professor/author/phD.  He comes off as fresh out of college and into an analyst position at the CIA.  He has this aloofness to him that shouldn't be present in Jack Ryan's character.  Ryan was a Marine!  His hero is more unwilling than unwitting.Rather than continuing the Jack Ryan story, Clancy and the film makers decided to produce a run-of-the-mill action/adventure movie that totally ignores the gripping underlying power struggles and international politics of the book in favor of the all-too-common knowledgeable newbie placed in extraordinary situations only to come out on top in a nice tidy fashion.  I guess I'll just stick to the novels - at least until it looks like Clancy's writing screenplays in leau of his normal thrilling masterpieces like Red Storm Rising, Hunt For Red October (in which they should have kept the original ending from the book - way better than the movie), Patriot Games, Rainbow Six, Clear & Present Danger, Without Remorse, etc.",The Sum of All Fears

Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is a bit too young and cocky -- any stint in the Marines, as Ryan is supposed to have, would have knocked that out of him years before he ever saw the inside of the CIA. (The fact that we have a new/young Jack Ryan who hasn't lived/aged consistently with previous film releases didn't bother me at all.) That said, I thought the story was gripping and suspenseful, and I was delighted that the story eschewed the magical James Bond nuclear rescue in favor of portraying the what-if of a genuine nuclear disaster.I though Liev Schrieber was terrific (give this guy a James Bond-type series!!) as was Michael Byrne (I hope I got the right character in mind: the old advisor to the Russian Premier, Grushkov, who turns out to be 'Spinnaker' in the end). Watching him throughout, I was constantly in mind of former NSA head Brent Scowcroft, knowing ""where all the bodies are buried, probably because he buried them there.""",The Sum of All Fears
362,tgumiran,Intricate well made film,7,3 November 2002,"""The Sum Of All Fears"" adds up to a well-made, intellectual, intricate movie. This film is directed by Phil Alden Robinson who also directed Sneakers (Robert Redford) and Field Of Dreams (Kevin Costner). It stars Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman. Ben plays a younger version of Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy's hero), CIA analyst who is thrust into trying to save us from starting a war with Russia. We have had two (2) previous Jack Ryans', Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford. Does Ben do a good job, I'll let you be the judge. Morgan Freeman as usual gives a great performance as Ben's boss and advisor to the President (James Cromwell). I might also add that Lev Schreiber is a good supporting cast member who I felt should have had more screen time because I wanted to know more about the role he played.This movie starts out slow because there are many supporting characters and they all play pivotal scenes important to this film. I admit there were times when I wondered when we would get to the story line. Note: do not miss any dialogue, pause this film or walk out of the room while it is playing because you could miss important story lines/scenes which you will need later.In summary, this is a story of a missing nuclear bomb lost in the 70's and who has it now. Will it be detonated in the United States and who is the cause of it.I gave it a 7 on the Internet Movie Database because it held my interest and also gave us some insight in the workings of the CIA (fact or fiction, it's nice to know that maybe our government agencies really work this way).",The Sum of All Fears

It really sucked.  This premise is great - it was slightly interesting to see the politics and the communications/intentions of both sides in the process of war and in the wake of a strike.  But still it was a yawn fest.  I contemplated walking out but I really thought something great has to be coming - some pay off.  Yes, when the bomb went off at the game and the devastation showed was the most exciting point of the film and the most chilling and haunting.  To see what would happen if (and hopefully god willing not when) this should happen what it would be like - but it lasted like a minute and was over.  Who gives a sh*t about Jack Ryan.  It was a great idea too bad it came from a novel.  They could have tweeked this and made it a really great film.   I was disappointed - wait for HBO to see it - save yourself the 8 bucks.

365,corgi231-1,Typically Bad Clancy Movie Plot (MEGA SPOILER ALERT!!!!),3,31 May 2002,"While the movie would have been entertaining if I were to check my brain at the door, given the hype I found the movie disappointing in the extreme.I found at least six major holes in the plot large enough to drive a space shuttle through. Now, don't misunderstand. I'm perfectly happy to suspend my disbelief at the movie theatre door in the case of obvious fantasies like Harry Potter or Shrek. I'm even willing to accept the notion that James Bond films are essentially cartoons no more related to reality than an episode of the old Batman TV show. However, when a movie purports to have some connection to the reality of current affairs, and it turns out to be no more realistic than the Itchy and Scratchy Show I get annoyed.Let's list the plot holes: 1. The Israeli plane gets shot down and the bomb doesn't explode on impact. That's just nuts. Between the impact and the heat generated by the explosions of the engines, the bomb must detonate. If you deny that, you are denying simple engineering. I'll accept that in an episode of Lost in Space but not in a mega-budget film written by the great guru of espionage flicks.2. The authors think the Israelis won't wonder what happened to their atomic missile? That's just nuts. An Israeli plane crashes into the Golan and the Israelis let the missile hang around for 30 years. Sorry. The Israelis know where their missiles are and they know that their neighbors would be happy to use even a grain of plutonium to harm them. This just defies reality.3. An atomic missile is smuggled out of Haifa Harbor by neo-Nazis? That's just loony. Now, the Mossad isn't as good as its press releases and is certainly riddled with KGB double-agents but it is absolutely inconceivable for any Israeli to be involved with Nazis no matter what the financial reward. There was this event in the 40s called the Holocaust. Perhaps, Mr. Clancy has heard of it. Especially after 9/11, the Israelis are extremely careful about what goes on in their state. Give them credit for being at least a little smarter than a doorknob.4. Ben Affleck gets into the Pentagon with Morgan Freeman's ID? The City of Baltimore has just been destroyed by a nuclear weapon and the Pentagon is easier to get into than the Z Smith Reynolds Airport in Winston-Salem, North Carolina? In the immortal words of Homey the Clown, 'No, I don't think so!'5. A nuclear weapon gets smuggled into the US. That can certainly happen but you really need some sort of serious cover. As Abe Rosenthal, the former editor of the New York Times, has said,'If you want to smuggle a nuclear weapon into the US, put it in a bale of marajuana.' The notion that there is anybody in the Customs Service in a position of authority who would allow a nuclear weapon into the States without a lot of  money changing hands and without leaving himself the opportunity to get far out of harm's way is farcical at best.6. Ben Affleck goes into the middle of a radiation zone without any protection and suffers no ill effects, not even the loss of one strand of hair. 'Nuff said.7. This last criticism is a general criticism of Tom Clancy stories. No rational person who has lived through the last decade or so in the US can possibly believe that the CIA is even minimally competent much less the repository of virtually all wisdom as depicted here or in any other Tom Clancy novel. CIA stands for 'Clueless in America.' Since 1990, we have seen the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the bombing of the World Trade Center, attacks on two embassies in Africa, the emergence of terrorist training bases in Afghanistan, Sudan, the Phillipines and G-d only knows where else, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Aldrich Ames case, the Robert Hansson case, BCCI, the bombing of our troops in the Khobar Towers, the USS Cole attack, and the suicide bombings of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Maxwell Smart and Larabee on a three week bender could do a better job.

However, both Morgan Freeman and Ben Affleck did a pretty good job, although I wouldn't categorize it as the best of their careers. And the special effects, particularly of the nuclear blast were well-done. They did a good job of using the effects to tell the story, rather than getting hung-up on how well they could do special effects, which so many movies do these days.In the end, it was worth the ticket price and then some.

It is definitely in line with the characterization of Jack Ryan but note this is a prequel. Ryan is in his younger days before he officially joins the CIA. The bombings on 911 are definitely the reason for this movies release. If they had not occurred then this movie might not have made it to the screen. Affleck did an admirable job as Ryan, but if you compare his attitude to the one Ryan had in Hunt for Red October, you will find he is more aggressive and is more risky in Sum of All Fears. He also doesn't show the boy-scout attitude present in the other films Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. Morgan Freeman did a great job as we are always accustomed to seeing.

Because we see in the trailors that the bomb does go off (should of left it out 'cause I know European audiences wouldn't have thought American filmmakers had the guts to let this happen), made me more interested in this movie than had it been a James Bond save-the-world-with-007-seconds-to-go film. What happened after was frightening and I do believe, realistic. What bothered me was the unrealism of all the electronic activity after the bombing (cell phone nets still working?) and how the Dr.'s pretty face was not at all wounded although she was standing directly in front of the window when the shock wave destroyed it. How sweet, ugh! So typical of U.S. films. Did Ben Affleck do justice to a young Jack Ryan: you bet. Was Morgen Freeman again superb: oh yes. And I loved the casting of the president's cabinet with old, white men, one who probably has a heart attack on board Air Force One (who cares, gotta' start the countdown).

I am an avid Tom Clancy fan, and Tom Clancy's alter ego Jack Ryan.  I do not understand Hollywood's attraction to Ben Affleck; he is an overrated cheba monkey who was lucky to befriend Matt Damon.  Ben Lopez I mean Affleck's last great work was playing O'Banyon in Dazed and Confused.  Maybe Jack Ryan should paddle people now.Second, I have read Tom Clancy's other books, but have not read Sum of All Fears.  If the movie is supposed to take place before Ryan gets married, why is everything else in present time, yet we are ten-fifteen years earlier in his career?  What happened to the fact he graduated from the naval academy, if this is still the case Ben Lopez portrays Ryan as a whinny overly shy third grader and not someone who shows the discipline of an individual who spent threes years in a military academy and spent the fourth completing his degree in a hospital bed.  Last time I checked most people who overcome great adversity such as a helicopter crash aren't whinny yuppie b*****ds. And did I mention that Jack Ryan's balls shrank, and when did his wife become a model?  Did anyone notice that all the doctors in her hospital were beautiful people?Third, the director should be rolled into a rug beaten and then dropped off at a carnival next to the Chimpanzee pen, because he should be directing the chimp's dancing and not a Tom Clancy piece.  When is Hollywood going to realize every action movie doesn't have to be the matrix with hundreds of slow motion shots, and off color film.  Just tell the damn story, too many special effects is like a salesman who won't shut up, he's just hiding that fact he doesn't have the skill to sell.Fourth, Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan?  He's about as good as Timothy Dalton. The Actor who played Capt. Winters in Band of Brothers would have been a perfect fit for Jack Ryan.I just can't stand the saturation of the Mocha Latte super sized, crap that is coming out of Hollywood.  It upsets me, maybe its just a clear indication that most of my generation just values beautiful people, and bad plots.

I believe going into this film as I did knowing little but enough is the best way because there was no preconceptions because I had seen no trailers or read any reviews. I was however disappointed with the film, the makers seemed to presume that the audience wouldn't understand that it was not the Russians. This was pointed out by Ben Afflecks character a countless number of times. I would think that him saying this once or maybe twice would easily be enough (even though it's obvious enough already).As I read in another review, half way through I found myself thinking how long is it until it ends and also thinking I wish I had gone to see 'The Bourne Identity' (which was on at the same time.) instead of being forced to try and be enthralled by the supposed 'tense' situation.Overall it's a film that should be watched if there is nothing else on and your bored.

Its better for the franchise if Ryan is young and doesn't have the level of authority that hes got in the later movies, so i liked the young Ryan running around trying to save the world stuff. The highlight of the movie was Schreiber as John Clark though, he projected a great balance of toughness and intelligence and was a nice contrast with Ryan on the recce because essentially Ryan has just entered the world that Clark is keen to escape. If they make the rainbow 6 movie without Liev i so wont go to see it because he totally nailed that character in four scenes in TSOAF.",The Sum of All Fears

386,debsdogsncats,Loop holes big enough to sail an aircraft carrier through,1,26 September 2020,"I don't think I can summon enough words to adequately explain how bad this movie is.First, were supposed to believe that Jack Ryan somehow ages backwards. Sure, we can all consider that maybe we've gone back to the start of his career as an analyst, but the times are modern. In fact, they are consistent the technology of current times.Second, we are expected to believe that the entire lot of US intelligence is limited to 5 cranky men surrounding the president and they communicate by pagers and crappy cellphones. That's it. Add to this that we are expected to believe that the President of the United States and the Director of the CIA would attend a Super Bowl seated amongst other fans at the front of section located in the middle-nosebleed territory surrounded by two, maybe three secret service agents instead of being located in a secure VIP area with rapid emergency exits nearby.Third, we are expected to believe that a military rescue unit rescues POTUS and the Director of the CIA via military rescue choppers after their caravan is crippled in a nuclear detonation, only to have the CIA Director somehow get separated from POTUS; his whereabouts unknown, only to find him later in a triage tent near ground zero. Really? Military rescue somehow gets POTUS out and safely onto Air Force One yet somehow manages to place another major government official in an emergency field hospital tent surrounded by other random victims???Then somehow they continue to expect us to believe someone comes away from a nuclear blast with only a scratch on her forehead after being hurled across the room from the blast which blew out the window, walls and desk she was behind. Never mind she was in direct exposure to said blast.There are so many incredibly ridiculous issues with this movie, I don't even know where to start to continue. Loophole after loophole, all big enough to sail an aircraft carrier through. They're all SO bad, SO unrealistic that it's actually laughable and NOT annoying when James Cromwell's bleeding and bandaged head appears to be miraculously healed at one point for a few brief seconds, and that it feels like they must be using Air Force One as a hurricane hunter while those 5 cranky men are deciding the fate of the world.This movie starts out confusing because you're trying to figure out why Jack Ryan's career is just starting even though he's saved Red October, dealt deliberately and concisely with the IRA in the African desert and saved a special ops team from the jungle in Columbia; then it flows worse from there. Much worse. Then it turns just plain ridiculous after that.",The Sum of All Fears

388,silvergrandam01,Hollywood should apologize to all of us Ryan fans,1,19 March 2007,"I have read every Jack Ryan book and loved each one. Unfortunately someone always decides to make a movie out of it. How Clancy hasn't b*tch-slapped someone yet is beyond me. How the movies fare so far.. Patriot Games.. acceptable. Hunt For Red October.. One of my favorites,even if different from the book, it basically got it right. Clear and Present Danger.. that's where things really started to jump the track, and fiction crept its way into an already fictionalized story.But this one... this one is truly a horrible horrible event for literate people the world over. I won't list every detail changed and mutilated from a once great story, but suffice it to say this movie is basically in name only a representation of the book. All other details are conveniently changed or overlooked.I understand that Clancy books are involved and takes some effort/intelligence to keep with the complex plots, but they always come to a great point, and leave me wanting more. This movie does not. If someone took my work and did an end-round with it like they did with this waste of film, I'd be homicidal.Hate isn't a strong enough word. Vile isn't a strong enough word.Then to cast my literary hero with Ben Affleck just pours more salt into a gaping wound in the side of my head. What a crock. Pearl Harbor was a totally ruined movie which inconveniently had a historic battle (which I'm sure the veterans of were extremely interested in seeing done in modern effects! or did we forget that this should have been more of a tribute to THEM) interrupt everyones love lives, but at least the Japanese still attacked for Christ sake. This movie doesn't even go that far.The real fun is how many clueless people say ""wow, what a great movie"" and don't even begin to realize what they're really missing by not PICKING UP A DAMN BOOK EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE!!!Hollywood, continue to play down to the lowest common denominator if you must, but leave the worthwhile stuff in life alone for those of us that can still read.

From the creators' point of view, if you portray this movie as a potentially realistic thriller, then at least give the audience some credit... Opposing presidents use the CIA-version of IRC-chat to talk to each other in the midst of a mini-nuclear war, helicopters and cars survive a nuclear blast at point blank range, characters travel around the globe at light speed, Israeli's lose a nuke and don't even bother searching for it, and everybody in this movie just seems to be brainless (apart from Mr. Freeman's character, which is probably why he has to die in the first place...)...I thought the other Jack Ryan movies were a joy to watch, and at least you didn't have to worry about incredible plot holes or disbelief over some of the patriotism, stupidity and truths in the movie, but THE SUM OF ALL FEARS really rocks off the scale. I figured having Mr. Clancy as executive producer on this movie should have helped, but he presumably kept in touch through his AOL Instant Messenger.My advice: go see this one (but only if you have some money to spare), but use an open mind, and try to think you're smarter than them...By the way, my rating: 3/10 (I must be in a good mood...)",The Sum of All Fears

It should be easy enough to detect due to its radioactivity. 4. Why would anyone be so stupid as to send an unescorted jet with a nuclear weapon ""on patrol"" after so many other jets have been shot down by Syrian AA missiles? As an executive producer, Tom Clancy should have been more careful not to make such gross mistakes. It seems that he is an expert on the US armed forces, but totally ignorant about the Middle East.

I am a big fan of Tom Clancy's books and the films that have been made from them, but this one was poorly adapted.Ben Affleck is a poor choice to play Jack Ryan. I can live with the fact that they made him younger and single, but he just doesn't fit in the role. The main problem with the movie is not the actors though - it is the adaptation of the story itself. If you've read the book, you know how incredibly complex it is. They tried to stuff that entire 500+ page book into a 2 hour movie and it just does not fit. The movie has no flow and no logical progression.Ryan also travels from one end of the city (Baltimore in this case) to another, with seemingly very little difficulty, despite the fact that a NUCLEAR BOMB just exploded at the Super Bowl in the very same city. Hello?!?!?!? In one 4 to 5 hour period, or less, he travels from where his helicopter crashed (out away from the city) to Ground Zero to the docks, to the hospital and then to the White House. Uh huh.His cell phone works too - very annoying when you KNOW that it wouldn't - they rarely worked in NY on 9/11 and that was ""only"" taking down one block of the city. Compare that to the devastation of a nuclear bomb and ask yourself if it's logical.It's one redeeming quality is the ending - very fraught with tension - and the effects are pretty cool.

401,zeebo32,"Half of the story is excellent, half of the story is absent.",6,3 June 2002,"The Sum of All Fears is an excellent book, and it would have been difficult to live up to in movie form.  So it seems as if the powers that be decided they wouldn't even bother trying.  Rather, they decided to make a popcorn film.The biggest problem I had with this film is the villain: an Austrian neo-Nazi billionaire.  WHAT???  That's the stuff of James Bond films.  The villain is not developed at all.  We learn that he was a member of the EU parliament who was kicked out for being too apologetic to the Nazis, that he's a billionaire, that he resents US-Russian domination of Europe during the Cold War, and that he wants to set off a nuke in the US in such a fashion as the make the US think it was Russia, thereby touching off nuclear war.  Why?  Well, I guess because he's an Austrian neo-Nazi billionaire who resents US-Russian domination.  I'm left to assume that's the life-mission of all such people, because no other explanation is really given.  It's not apparent that he's doing this because then Europe will be more powerful, or he'll personally gain power or money, no - he's just doing it.  That's James Bond stuff to me - it works in James Bond movies, it doesn't work here. That aspect of the plot - which is VERY important - needed a lot of development.  The novel, which had the villains as being Arabs seeking to prevent the peace process, etc., worked much better.Here's something else that bugs me.  The next Clancy novel in line to be made into a movie was The Cardinal of the Kremlin, but this was shelved because the suits who run the studios didn't think anyone wanted to see a movie about US-Soviet Union conflict since the Cold War has been over for a decade or what have you.  Ok, fine, so they made Fears instead.  I happen to think that if you make a good movie, people will see it, but whatever.  But what we end up with in The Sum of All Fears is a climactic nuclear showdown between the US and Russia that nearly goes hot.  So what the hell is the difference?  Cardinal would have had war between the US and the USSR, this one had a near-war between the US and Russia.  Ugh.  They could have made Cardinal and then made Fears.  Or made Fears but stuck to the original story (you know, the one that made sense and is realistic).This film frustrated me.  I was hopeful that the decision to make Jack Ryan would seem irrelevant, and I honestly believe it would have if this was a thorough, complete story.  But it isn't, so the Jack Ryan age issue becomes a distraction.  Where do they go next?  Re-work Cardinal so that it involves some other country/group besides the USSR?  Try to find a place in Red Storm Rising for Jack Ryan?  He's way too young now to have anything to do with Debt of Honor or Executive Decision.  I think they may have unnecessarily painted the franchise into a corner with this film.All of that being said, Ben Affleck performed rather well in this film. The characterization of Jack Ryan seemed is dead-on in terms of his personality and such.  We're supposed to imagine that The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and Clear and Present Danger never happened and I suppose never will happen.  If you can get past that, you'll probably enjoy this representation of Jack Ryan.All in all, The Sum of All Fears makes for a good popcorn movie.  It's got a lot of excitement and tension.  It's filled with some pretty good acting. It's just missing a smart, coherent, realistic story which is the cornerstone of pretty much all of Clancy's work.

'The Sum Of All Fears' is Awesome. I've never been a fan of Affleck, always thought he was an over-rated pretty boy. But, the guy's really doing his best and his acting is getting better with each movie. He just needs to stay away from those fluffy romantic nonsense for awhile. He's a pretty good action star.

I wouldn't say that I wouldn't want to watch it again. However, I think that the science surrounding the movie could have been much more accurate. This kind of disappoints me. I think this is largely true of many films in Hollywood, but I would love to see a movie like this where when analyzing the science of the movie, it doesn't all fall apart. Despite this I think that the movie does bring up important questions surrounding nuclear warfare as well as nuclear weapons. Things like how and when should they be used? Do they serve a purpose in todays society? So, while the science surrounding the explosion of the bomb in the football stadium might have some inaccuracies I think that there is much that one can gain from the movie particularly from thinking about these questions.",The Sum of All Fears
405,tedadams,"Good Movie, Not so Good Ben",8,31 May 2002,"The Sum of All Fears is a fine entry in the thriller category, as the U.S. and Russia go eyeball-to-eyeball in a face off that could easily lead to a nuclear engagement.  The plot is not too fantastic and none the characters are asked to do anything that is unbelievable.  If anything, in the light of the events of September 11, the plot feels plausible enough to be quite frightening.As events spiral out of control, both the U.S. and the Russian presidents appear only responsive to the press of urgent events rather than being in control.  They do not try to bend events to their will, being responders, not initiators of action.  The two presidents are captives of their staffs. They make decisions in response to the proposals shouted at them by advisers as events unfold.  All proceed with imperfect knowledge feeling that they must act decisively rather than confirm the information that they are acting upon or appearing weak.  If our real leaders are as bereft of anything resembling real leadership, lord help us all.Ben Affleck does reasonably well as the lead, Jack Ryan.  This role has a nice balance between intrepid adventure stuff and a romantic match-up with Bridget Moynahan and he does both pretty well.  That said, it is difficult... very difficult, to see Affleck as having a PhD in History and speaking Ukrainian and Russian.

This film really makes you think about the possibilties, especially in the Post-9/11 world.  While Russia seems like less of a threat now than the rouge terroists of the al-Qaida network, the message is still clear: once some of us are in, we are all in, and there is no getting out.  While this film has a feel-good ending, it doesn't take away from its power.  It is also very well acted and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

407,Mr_Nobody,Great summer blockbluster that delivers much more...,9,30 May 2002,"The Sum of All Fears, starring Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman, breathes new life into the franchise of movies begun by Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford. The world was introduced to Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan in 1990's The Hunt for Red October and the follow ups Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. The Sum of All Fears examines how Jack Ryan, Ben Affleck, began his journey in the CIA to become one of the most powerful men in the world; in Tom Clancy's universe, of course. Affleck plays the wet-behind-the-ears rookie, Ryan, a young CIA analyst from the Russian desk whose job seems to involve keeping tabs on the diplomacy of ailing Russian President and the rampant sex lives of Russian politicians.  Jack Ryan is thrust into a position of the informant to the President once the pyramid of power in Russia has toppled, allowing the ascension Alexander Nemerov.  Ryan is brought in as the authority on the new and seemingly volatile Russia President, played by Ciarán Hinds, as long as those in power listen to what he has to say..Affleck does not act alone here; he has an incredible troupe of supporting actors, if they can be called just that. The young analyst is taken almost immediately under protective wing by CIA Director, Bill Cabot played Morgan Freeman. Not atypically, Freeman picks up the mentor role for which he has become famous for yet manages to inject a different kind of flare. Freeman isn't grasping at straws here; he's confident in the knowledge that he has and in his established role as the President's adviser. It's Ryan that has the come to grips with what he knows and the inability of the leaders of America to use what he knows to their benefit. Yet, thankfully, The Sum of All Fears doesn't degenerate into a simple film about a CIA guru rising above everything to save the day. Well, it is that, but its also so much more.This film is obviously about the depths to which terrorists will go to see the mighty powers of the world destroy each other and the attempt, by seemingly one man, the clear the cloud of deception. But The Sum of All Fears resounds in its ability to combine the chaos of diplomacy and the real men who could order the end of the world, as we know it. The incomparable James Cromwell as President Fowler is, as always, fantastic. He brings such evocative emotion and reality to the greatest fears of not only Americans, but also all people. Aboard Air Force One, after the nuclear explosion that rocks most of Baltimore, Fowler argues with Defense Secretary Becker (Phillip Baker Hall), National Security Advisor Revel (Bruce McGill), and Secretary of State Owens (Ron Rifkin) in gut-wrenchingly honest and intense display of emotions.The only glaring errors in The Sum of All Fears are the inconsistencies when comparing the film to the previous films based on Jack Ryan; such as taking place in the present instead of following a more realistic timeline considering and comparing Ryan's age. But this is nit picking, and there's no need for it. Fans and non-fans alike (of Clancy's books or movies) are given a world in which they can explore on any level. However, Clancy-readers will rejoice to find John Clark played perfectly by Liev Schreiber. The occasional glimpse that the audience is given of the most intense character Clancy ever created is exciting.As for the villains of the film, Alan Bates as Richard Dressler is perfectly chilling, once labeling Germany as unable to handle the power that Nazism gave to it and Hitler simply stupid, not insane. That Neo-nazi Fascists have replaced the intended Arabian terrorists from Clancy's original work comes across as fresh and conceivable, not like some pathetic attempt to try and gloss over Sept. 11and the nationalities of those true terrorists. And of course, the nuclear explosion is haunting and breathtaking at once. The implications of its impact that director Phil Robinson gives us only hints of, is perfectly terrifying, never taking the cliché route of overexposing the audience to the horror of the fission bomb.To be honest, it's the relationships that make The Sum of All Fears work so well. The exploration of the strained relationship between Ryan and Cathy Muller (Bridget Moynahan) is effective in its simplicity and subtly. The development feels natural and the strain on the relationship because of Ryan's increased responsibilities, unbeknownst to Muller, fits perfectly. But this love affair thankfully takes up a comfortable position on the back seat as the major players come towell, play. Hinds' Nemerov is electrifying and played to perfection as a ruler whose power is used in the attempt to destroy him. Both the power and vulnerability of this character is tangible, which can be said of Fowler as well. And Ryan (Affleck) is the perfect foil to them both. If only he can get them to listen.The Sum of All Fears is, by far, one of the better movies that has come out this year. By no means are we to forget its supposed to be a blockbuster, but thankfully it's a little more than that. A little more intelligent, funny, and a hell of a lot better acted than most. And damnits Ben Affleckand he's good!",The Sum of All Fears

The pacing is good in this film, the script and direction terse and right on key.  The supporting cast starting with Morgan Freeman is first rate. It's been a long time since I've seen an action film that is as rewarding as this one.  The only negative comment I would make is that casting Ben Affleck as an unmarried Jack Ryan would naturally make you assume that this film is a prequel to the Harrison Ford pair.  However, it is set in current day which is necessary given the climate between Russia and the US the film establishes, but nonetheless jarring.  Although I remained conscious of this throughout the film, it did not really detract from the satisfying feeling this film affords.",The Sum of All Fears

418,onyxw,The second half rebounds,6,6 June 2002,"Contains Spoilers! I'm a big fan of the Clancy books and a bigger fan than most of the Jack Ryan movies, unfortunately this one falls a bit flat and only a couple of the subplots redeem things.I knew going into the theater about the revamping of the Ryan character so as to de-age him, and that had me greatly worried about how things would play out in regards to sticking with the book. My fears, I think, were mostly realized. The movie severs ties with most of the heart and soul of the book. Sure there's the bombing of the superbowl, but it lacks the same portrayal of Jack. Sum of All Fears, the novel, had him pinned against a corner, he's being ousted from his job by Liz Elliot and President Fowler, he's having troubles in bed, his marriage is in near shambles with his wife thinking he might be cheating on him, and it takes faith from his wife and a little help from his friends to get through it. That's gone. While the new love blossoming is a nice approach, it's been done...this one was about a man hitting rock bottom by being hit from all sides and yet still able to recover, and it's not there. And I realize it's impossible to condense a 900 page book into a 2 1/2 hour movie without losing things. I'm not complaining of that, if I were I'd be whining about them changing the tank battle in the middle of Germany to the launching of planes instead. But aside from a few key plot elements kept, the movie lost a good deal of the essence of the book.The backstory is rushed along so as to get us to the bomb detonation in a fairly quick manner, and yet at the same time, I felt my rear falling asleep as it somehow managed to drag nonetheless. Now I understand the need to get to the bombing and the tense standoff, as that did take up the focus of the movie, but the first 45 mins or so felt lacking of purpose, spinning its wheels at times.Now there is definite redemption. Everything that happens after the initial showing of the Superbowl stadium was enjoyable. (The Florida Gators in the superbowl was a nice touch)...well let me take that back, having Talbot die in the airplane seemed a bit silly and out of place. It was a nice attempt at keeping certain aspects of the book in...but it just came off as them trying to shove more ties to the book because they felt they were lacking than it did to serve any purpose to progressing the movie.The individual characters did an excellent job, Ben Affleck makes a good young Jack Ryan, and I look forward to more by him. While this is one of the lesser of the Jack Ryan films, it's not due to the cast. I enjoyed Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, more than Alec Baldwin. The supporting characters did extremely well with their characters, especially some of the smaller ones.Morgan Freeman was top notch, that's all there is to say on that, he's nothing less than his amazingly talented career would lead you to believe. He provided the majority of the humor of the movie, much to Jack Ryan's chagrin.As for what else was good? The minor story arcs with Clark and the end with Spinnaker. The only other thing I enjoyed was the use of overhead photography to show the different locations for the movie. I thought that was a nice touch.6 out of 10. Wait for it on home video, you're not missing much. A good deal of individual excellence that just doesn't quite seem to meld properly to make a good movie.",The Sum of All Fears

If you've watched the previews, then the plot is already rotten--for they tell you all there is to know about what happens.Here we go:A group of fascists buy a nuclear bomb on the black market so they can use it to provoke the United States to attack Russia in some weird hope that a major war between two nuclear superpowers will lead the masses of people to become goose-stepping Hitler lovers. So they decide to set off the nuclear bomb in Baltimore during a football game that the president is attending.The president gets word of this and leaves the stadium just in time. Even though he is still in the city and his limo was knocked over by a thermonuclear blast, he miraculously escapes unharmed. Morgan Freeman, who was in the same limo however, dies for some reason. (as an aside, the arms trader who found the bomb dies of radiation poisoning, but the guy who buys it doesn't---this is a really strange weapon)Ben Affleck, also in Baltimore and equally unharmed by the giant radioactive explosion, tries to tell the president that the Russians are not to blame--it's the Neo-Nazis.30 seconds before the US launches warheads at Russia, the president calls it off.The Russian and American president become friends and sign a treaty banning nukes forever.

420,Roxie1285,This movie was TERRIBLE!!!!,1,3 June 2002,"I read the book ""The Sum of All Fears"" by Tom Clncy and it was amazing!! It was definitely one of my favorite books. Tom Clancy is an amazing author and I love to read his work. So I was obviously appalled by the fact that Tom Clancy would allow this terrible movie to carry the same title as his amazing novel. The movie did not go by the book at all. I mean, Jack Ryan was married with two children and the Deputy Director of the CIA in the book and Morgan Freemans characters name was Marcus. They couldn't even keep simple facts like that in the movie. John Clark was Jack Ryans driver and close friend, not some man Ryan went to Russia to assist. President Fowler did not have a wife and was actually having an affair with his National Security Advisor Liz Elliott in the book. There was no mention of the Vatican Treay or of the trade problems with Japan. Details suc as this defined his excellent novel and Hollywood took it and destroyed it. Even if I had not read the book, I still would have thought it was a terrible movie. It was hard to follow and just overall the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a HUGE fan of Ben Afflect, but even he could not save the movie. I also do not think that he was the best choice to replace Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan. I enjoy reading Tom Clancy novels and I hope that next time a movie is made based on a Tom Clancy book that it is based more closely to the book. Tom Clancy is very creative and while I would NOT RECOMMEND any one see the movie, I would recommend the read the book. But then again, they always say the the book is always a million times better than the book.",The Sum of All Fears

424,ra-15,Successful rape of the great book on behalf of James Bond's fans,4,13 June 2002,"1. SO inconsistent with the ""Jack Ryan"" books.2. SO inconsistent with the ""Jack Ryan"" movies.3. Somewhat inconsistent with the reality. :)I am not going to list first two kind of bugs. Lots of people have pointed them. Let's concentrate on the ""reality"" splits.*** THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW ***As I am Russian, I would point out some things many people just not able to notice:1. there is a scene where Clark (who perfectly speak Russian and was able to fool old woman, mother of nuclear scientist) and Ryan are involved in the standoff with two Ukrainian soldiers. Clark does not understand them but Ryan speaking in Ukrainian is able to convince them to surrender.Well, someone here has said it is impossible that (Ben Afflek's) Ryan would study both Russian and Ukrainian languages instead of playing football for his college team. Frankly, truth is more ugly. Both Russian and Ukrainian languages have the same roots and very similar. While guards were really speaking in Ukrainian, Clark with his perfect Russian would not have any problems understanding them (as I did not have such problems). Moreover, Ryan was addressing those soldiers (who do not appear Ukrainian soldiers to me, as Ukraine's army consists of young draftees, 18-22 years old) in RUSSIAN.2. In summary, Russian dialogues in the film are lame. And they sound like Yoda sometimes. I can't believe it's not possible to hire somebody more professional for this purpose.And all primary ""russian"" cast in the film is being played by non-russians, which shows another big flaw - russian dialogues were read just terribly. Russian president can't speak both Russian AND English - this is SO funny.It is not big deal, and I would not concentrate my attention on it if the secondary ""russian"" cast was not played by real russian actors. I have spotted Alexander Belyavsky (who is pretty good russian actor) in several scenes. But he does not speak a word! Why he has been choosen for this role? Because of his russian face? :))3. From military point of view scenes with the aircraft carrier are plain stupid. I believe (and Mr.Clancy has perfectly shown this in his book ""Red Storm Rising"") that you need more then three TU-22M Backfire bombers to breach carrier's defense, which consists of AWACS, F14s on the patrol/scramble and escort ships. I believe that bombers should be detected by radars several dozens kilometers away and not just before entering visual range. Anyway, bombers do not need to enter visual range to attack carrier with their missiles, as those missiles are able to hit target far from the RADAR detection range.Same for retaliation scene with the F-16s. Well, to my best knowledge, F-16s are not used on carriers. They use f-14/fa-18 there and for that specific purpose of hitting ground target there is A-6 Intruder attack plane. As well as cruise missiles. And I doubt that this attack/retaliation scheme fits into timeline. And I doubt more seriously, that those F-16s would be able to penetrate russian air defense so easily, that it was not even worth to mention. :)
And Mr. Clancy, please, get Moscow's yellow pages somewhere. Because names you are using in your books, they are either not russian or very rare or VERY famous. Just imagine pizza deliverer George Washington (who's boss's name is Jack Nicholson) meets his old buddy Tom Sawyer on the way to the client named Mojo-Jojo. Well, you get the picture. Which makes you laugh on otherwise great books. :)",The Sum of All Fears
425,mjtol,"Entertaining film, but ruined by too many changes and errors",4,18 June 2002,"***SPOILERS throughout, but not much more than you could figure out from the previews.***As a U.S. Navy pilot (over 14 years' total experience studying many of the topics covered in the movie), with specific expertise in strategic (nuclear) command and control, and as a reader of Clancy novels, I was very interested in this movie.General: As a stand-alone movie, and for entertainment value alone, I'd give it about a 9 (but I'm very easily entertained--I'd give high entertainment-value marks to lots of bad movies).  But for reality, consistency, and faithfulness to the book (and other Clancy movies), it deserves no higher than a 2 or 3.  I'm willing to give movies a lot of leeway for reality and consistency when they don't take themselves too seriously (e.g. Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Batman, even Charlie's Angels), but SOAF clearly tries to sell itself as a true-to-reality flick.  Plus, the mistakes I've pointed out were easily correctable.  My overall rating was a generous 4.Faithfulness: The movie is supposed to appeal to Clancy fans, but it absolutely butchers the book.  I know you have to accept some screen adaptation, but this was way beyond that.  It's not even consistent with the other Ryan movies.  I won't go on as this has been covered well by other reviewers.  Tom Clancy should be ashamed of himself for putting his name on this movie.On balance, IMDb reviewers have done a good job, so from now on I'll concentrate on items they got wrong or missed entirely.F-16 strike on Russian airbases: (1) In a high level of alert, Russian air defenses over their Backfire bases would have been saturated with radars, SAMs, and fighters.  Nearly impossible for F-16s to cruise in untouched. (2) Much more likely conventional strike would have been done with B-2's based in the continental U.S. or sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles. Almost impossible for F-16's to get there unless based nearby (Norway?) and/or with heavy tanker support.  Many other more realistic options.  (3) This was particularly amusing, and no one caught it: In the dead of winter, in or near the Arctic Circle, the sun was shining brightly overhead and it was partly cloudy--unlikely!  Even in the middle of the day, it would have been dusky at best, with the sun low on the horizon, and the weather would likely have been much worse.  (4) Weak visual effects/choice of footage.Strike on U.S. carrier: (1) I really enjoyed the visual effects, but that's about it.  (2) In a time of high tension, a U.S. carrier in the North Atlantic would have had at least its normal early warning and combat air patrol aircraft airborne.  These assets and escorting ships would have detected the Russian bombers hundreds of miles out.  (3) The Backfire bombers (which are NOT MiGs, as one reviewer said) would have launched from 100-300 miles out (NOT visual range), and probably not at sea level, depending on type of missile used.Nuclear effects: (1) It was made clear that this was a small nuclear device (one-tenth of Hiroshima).  So, the explosion's direct effects would not have been as far-reaching as depicted.  Some reviewers erroneously thought that the effects should have been more severe.  (2) The EMP and radiation effects may not have been very severe (the movie got this correct).  Both of these are highly dependent on the type of device and location.  A ground burst would result in more radiation, but then again many nukes are manufactured so as not to produce high levels of radiation, and again, this was a very small bomb.  And the EMP effects would have been minimized by the size of the weapon and location of the explosion.  It is very possible that mobile phones, etc. would still be working.B-2's: (1) It is extremely unlikely that B-2's would be based outside of the U.S., except possibly in remote locations (NOT Aviano, Italy), even in wartime.  (2) The Russians would definitely NOT take the B-2's' launching to be a sign of anything--it would be absolutely normal to have bombers airborne during higher DEFCONs.  (3) Even if the Russians could track the stealthy B-2's, how could they do so when the bombers were over central Europe?  Satellites can't track fast-moving aircraft and the Russians haven't had their armed forces based in eastern Europe for about a decade. (4) The Russians wouldn't automatically assume that the bombers were nuclear-armed.  To this point in history, they have been used very effectively as conventional bombers (e.g. Kosovo, Afghanistan).  See above comments.Characters/misc: (1) Most reviewers got this right: A young, cute Ben Affleck doesn't seem believable as Jack Ryan at any point in Ryan's career. (2) As for Mr. Clark, I'm surprised that most reviewers liked Liev Schreiber.  Schreiber was too young, goofy, and easily unsettled/annoyed. Willem Dafoe wasn't perfect but he was more stable, serious, mysterious, and professional (and slightly disturbed), as the Mr. Clark from the novels appears to be.  (3) The reckless use of God's name did not add to the emotional content, tension, storyline, reality, etc.--nor did Jack's sleeping with Cathy on the third date.",The Sum of All Fears

It definitely isn't worthy of being in the same family of movies as the other works.  The reasons his other films worked so well was because people who were simply looking for an action movie could enjoy it for the action, while people who were more knowledgeable about politics and the military could enjoy it on another level ... but this film caters to people who know nothing more than what they see on CNN, while including mediocre action.",The Sum of All Fears

Many other movies break up and solves the ""problems"" just in time to save the world from the nuclear bomb, but SOAF actually tells the story of how impossible it is to track down the bomb in time.A few things with the movie could surely have been done better, but hey, if the movie is fascinating, I'm fascinated, and the flaws easily disappear in the story. Things like Ryan surviving both this and that, the more or less not so impressive deaths of certain characters which I will not name to ruin the film for you and the fact that the Israeli can completely forget a nuclear bomb in the middle of the desert does not affect the completeness of the movie for me.This is definelity a good 8 or a minor 9.

438,mike-269-217521,What a weak waste of an incredible story,2,18 January 2012,"The entire Jack Ryan franchise has been so royally screwed up, it just makes no sense. The sequence of Patriot Games, Hunt for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin (book only), Clear and Present Danger, and the Sum of All Fears all build upon each other (not to mention the books Debt of Honor, Executive Decisions, and The Bear and the Dragon, which follow). If you have seen the movies, my guess is you have no personal interest in Jack Ryan's character whatsoever, and don't really see how any of them are related. With no interest in the main character, I see little that would interest me in the plot – and therefore the film - let alone the franchise. This isn't just a ""the book was so much better than the movie"" rant. This movie sucks. The original book wraps such incredible tension into the characters as they all -- unknowingly -- approach the inevitable moment. There is no preconceived knowledge of what is about to happen. This movie reduces that tension (on the stereotypical ""can you hear me now?"" poor cell phone connection) to meaningless drivel with Affleck's moronic ""the bomb is in playI repeatthe bomb  is  IN  PLAY!!!"". There was more plot in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" – and that's saying something.The real story is meant to revolve around how the characters react to what happens (according to each's preconceptions and personal shortcomings), and the larger ramifications those reactions have to the government, the country, the world. The heroism results from the actions taken by a desperate, broken man who acts with complete personal disregard ... to save the very system that has deliberately broken him. The psychological effect of the key moment in this story, and the desperation that ensues in its aftermath are non-existent in this movie.Do yourself a favor – read the books, in order. Then realize that they were written before 9/11, before biological attack scares, stock market/cyber-attacks, before Iraq, before the current tension with Iran, before what doesn't seem to be too far off into the horizon with China. Starting with Clear and Present Danger, it will seriously freak you out to see that, some 20 years ago, Clancy predicted many of the traumatic major world events that have occurred in the past decade (and may yet be unfolding in the near future). Not that I walk around wearing a tin foil hat, but seriously, it's freaky.OK, I guess this is a ""the book is so much better than the movie"" rant after all.",The Sum of All Fears
439,ussstargazerj,The Sum of All Fears,8,29 June 2012,"There may be some spoiler-ige here, please forgive me.There are two ways to look at this film. As a stand alone film, I found it rather enjoyable. A great cast and equally fantastic effects in a fast-paced techno-thriller, with the added bonus of a good script, which could be funny at times, but was serious when it needed to be. While certain flaws may stand out a lot (they did for me, but I look for them), it's still the kind of film to share with your friends.However, it IS a reboot of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan film series, meant to modernize it the way the new 'Star Trek' did for Roddenberry's franchise. Unlike 'Trek,' it didn't work. Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) stumbles around haphazardly looking for clues like a good little CIA agent - do you want a treat? That's a good boy! - while everyone around him runs around without a head because no-one has all the info.Oh, except Jack.All the time we're thinking, ""This can't be the guy who steals a Russian submarine BY HIMSELF?!?!""To recap: Good: script, actors, effects, story Bad: reboot, screw-ups (they can pop out rather bad), and villain (I mean, like, Neo-Nazis?

And as the executive producer of this project, he can modify the story as he sees fit to make an entertaining film. Michael Crichton, Jo Rowling and many others have done the same thing many times.I agree with the point that ""the movie is not as good as the book."" That is usually the case, and exactly why, if given the opportunity, I will see a movie before reading the book. The definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. If you know that books are almost always better than the movie version of the same story, why go to the movie after reading the book? Especially if you somehow expect it to be better this time? Next, regarding the age and marital status of Jack Ryan, please remind yourself of my earlier comment. This is Tom Clancy's story and Jack Ryan is Mr. Clancy's character. Is there a rule somewhere that I missed stating that a novelist's recurring character has to follow any kind of timeline? Take it for what you will, but I suggest that when viewing the movie version of a novel you enjoyed, do your best to disassociate the two. See the novel as one piece of art and the movie as another. When reading, we tend to decide for ourselves what the character looks like, sounds like, acts like, etc. If the movie is similar to its book version, wonderful! If (especially under the supervision of the author) the story has been changed from the book, look at it as a different story.I think it is safe to say that you will be happier spending your entertainment dollar if you don't waste time trying to find fault when watching a movie, attending a play, listening to a concert, whatever. Take it for what it is and judge it accordingly.",The Sum of All Fears
441,Homjunk,Ben is not a action drama star,5,1 February 2005,"The movie is not bad itself. Bring in Ben and it goes to poop. As I liked him in Good Will Hunting, he has spoiled every movie with action drama to include Pearl Harbor. Watch the movie if you don't agree with me. Afterwards, you will. During dramatic scenes, it seems as if his character is not really in the movie, but rather a separate entity superimposed into the script. It's like a baby crying during an underwater exploration. It reminds you that your watching a movie, not experiencing it. Also, for a movie to capitalize on peoples' fears about terrorism is morally wrong in my opinion. It should have been kept as a book, and not made into a movie.",The Sum of All Fears
442,jiml-3,The film does not give the full horror of what might happen.,8,3 March 2005,"Having lived through the 2nd world war and cold war eras I can say with absolute confidence that the under thirty generation is clueless concerning the horrors of the plot of this movie or the 'Dr Strangelove' movie. They have not gone to bed during the 'Cuban Missle Crisis' hoping they would wake up the next morning. At that time I was in my early twenties and fully aware of the impending confrontation in the waters near Cuba. The world had already come to a condition called 'M.A.D.' (Mutual Assured Destruction) and bomb shelters were being built all over the U.S.A. and other countries. The knowledgeable people understood that their continued existence hinged on certain buttons not being pushed. Fortunately the Russian premier had the common sense not to go any further. (just like the movie) and we still exist. The condition called 'M.A.D.' still exists, and I for one hope that no country attempts to start a war between any two nuclear powers as that will be the beginning of the end. You younger people need to find a way out of the situation my generation got us into. or else oblivion will be the rule. As an accurate rendition of the book, the movie fails miserably. as for being believable, the characters are weak and ineffectual. The entertainment value is limited. But the potential for teaching is nearly insurmountable. This movie and certain others like the aforementioned 'Dr Stranglove' along with 'Fail Safe' should be taught as a required course in High Schools and College to the inheritors of this ball of constantly increasing pollution called Earth. If taught in the correct way, these self-absorbed progeny of this generation might just have the cojones to make the needed changes so that their hoped for offspring will come to exist here also.",The Sum of All Fears
443,jasongreen-37269,Unfair overall rating,9,9 December 2020,"Long time user first time reviewer on imdb.
I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Okay there were a few holes and factual errors but I could pick holes in any film from A few good men to Zulu but I don't think any of that detracts from what I consider an entertaining couple of hours.
Give this film a chance and I think you'll agree.",The Sum of All Fears
