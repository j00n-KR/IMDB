0,Leofwine_draca,Nicolas Cage hunts a serial killer in the icy north,4,29 May 2017,"THE FROZEN GROUND is an Alaska-set Hollywood serial killer thriller, based on a true story from the 1980s. It stars Nicolas Cage as a cop on the trail of serial killer John Cusack, and much of the narrative revolves around a former victim and the only person to escape the killer's clutches, played by Vanessa Hudgens. The icy locales always make for a decent cinematic backdrop, but I'm afraid I found the rest of the production largely uninteresting.The problem with this film is its familiarity. The subject matter is predictable and dragged out and you never feel the urgency or momentum of the situation, as you do in the true classics of the genre like ZODIAC or SEVEN. Cage downplays it for the most part, as does Cusack, but this means that by contrast Hudgens gives something of a histrionic turn that I found irritating. The story takes place in the usual grungy strip clubs and the like and is frequently dark and nihilistic, but this time around that didn't amount to a very enjoyable viewing experience for me.",The Frozen Ground
1,SnoopyStyle,thriller falls flat,5,29 September 2015,"It's 1983 Anchorage. The cops find prostitute Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens) handcuffed and beaten. She tells them that she was being kidnapped by respected citizen Robert Hansen (John Cusack) but they don't believe her. One cop who believes Cindy's story sends Hansen's case to State cop Jack Holcombe (Nicolas Cage). Jack is investigating a dead body. He believes it's a serial killer and forced to take the case despite plans to quit. While Jack tries to help Cindy, Robert has a new victim in Debbie Peters. Clate Johnson (50 Cent) is Cindy's former pimp.Most of this movie is flat. As a crime mystery thriller, the movie has few thrills until the end. There is no mystery because everything is laid out. The movie is devoid of tension except for the climax. There isn't anything wrong with the acting. This is functional but it's too bland for too long.",The Frozen Ground
2,claudio_carvalho,Great and Effective Old-Fashioned Thriller,7,16 November 2013,"In 1993, in Anchorage, Alaska, the young prostitute Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens) is found cuffed in her apartment and she claims that she has been rapped and threatened by Robert ""Bob"" Hansen (John Cusack), a citizen married with children. The police officers do not believe on her words and Cindy returns to the streets and Bob is not accused.Meanwhile Sergeant Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage) is assigned to investigate the murder of seven young women and the detective that found Cindy secretly sends her case to him. Jack believes that Bob is the serial-killer but he has no evidences to arrest him. Jack tries to earn Cindy's trust to send Bob to the court but she is afraid and tries to leave Alaska. ""The Frozen Ground' is a great and effective old-fashioned thriller that is supported in performances and not in explosions, car chases or special effects. Based on true events, the plot succeeds in keeping the attention of the viewer, despite the killer's identity be disclosed in the beginning. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sangue no Gelo"" (""Blood on the Ice"")",The Frozen Ground
3,kosmasp,Proving Ground,6,25 December 2013,"Not so much for Nicolas Cage (or John Cusack for that matter), but for the one and only Vanessa Hudgens. While she also did Spring Breakers (another movie she tried to get rid of the Teenager/romantic image everyone is associating her with), she wasn't done there. This is another role to prove she can be more.Of course if you go in pre-occupied, she won't convince you. And while she's not the best actress out there, she really puts herself out there. The story itself is pretty standard and a thriller that pushes all the right buttons. Cage does his thing (though not over the top, if you're expecting something like that) and Cusack goes an extra mile. It's not great, but a nice little movie",The Frozen Ground
4,Sleepin_Dragon,It's a pretty watchable film.,6,7 September 2020,"The Frozen Ground tells the chilling story of a aerial killer in Alaska, who targeted young women, but let one slip.It's an incredibly dark, sombre film, with an intensely bleak tone from start to finish. It's pretty good, it lacks some of the subtleties that you may have hoped would be here, however it's there to tell a story, and it gets the job done.Not often can I stick with a film starring Nicholas Cage, I'm not really a fan of his, or the roles that be tends to take, but credit where it's due, he's pretty good here, it's a subtle performance, he's better than most of the other cast.Very gritty, it needed a few lighter moments to have made it work better.A decent watch, 6/10.",The Frozen Ground
5,classicsoncall,"""I should have killed you when I had the chance!""",7,2 November 2021,"The impact of this movie doesn't really hit until it ends and you get to see photos of the real women tortured and killed by the film's villain, portrayed by John Cusack. I say this because while you're watching, even if you learned it's based on a true story, you simply follow along like any other crime thriller until the bad guy is brought to justice. You have your usual breaks in the case, along with the frustrating judicial roadblocks thrown in the way of State Police Investigator Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage). The victims mentioned don't register as any more than another number in the killer's portfolio, largely in part due to the seedy nature of the environment most of them came out of - grungy back alleys and dingy saloons where hookers ply their trade in a backwater Alaskan town. The only significant face put on the victims is that of Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens), a teenage prostitute who warily casts her fate with Halcombe in order to track down the meticulous rapist and murderer, Robert Hansen (Cusack). As a consequence of his evil nature, the real life Hansen was sentenced to four hundred sixty one years PLUS life for the murders of seventeen victims whose graves were found. Additional casualties connected to his case remain unsolved but seem likely, elevating Hansen's status to that of the most reprehensible serial killers of all time.",The Frozen Ground
6,gavin6942,Cusack and Cage Reunited,6,2 June 2014,"An Alaska State Trooper (Nicolas Cage) partners with a young woman who escaped the clutches of serial killer Robert Hansen (John Cusack) to bring the murderer to justice. Based on actual events.Interestingly, the film starts out with a detective saying he has only two weeks left and will not have time to track down a serial killer. This, to me, was very reminiscent of Morgan Freeman's character in ""Seven"". Whether intentional or not, it was a nice reference point.This is not the best cop-and-killer film, nor is it the worst. Cusack gives a decent performance (though not his best, and not particularly memorable). Cage has been said by others to be better than he has been in a while here. That may be so, though very little is asked of him.",The Frozen Ground
7,lee_eisenberg,I'd like to be able to more extensively learn about the story elsewhere,5,11 July 2018,"I had never heard about Bob Hansen* before seeing ""The Frozen Ground"". The movie will be interesting if you want to learn about the story, but is mostly a popcorn movie. Plenty of fascinating information about what a sick man Hansen was - and lots of great shots of Alaska - but not worth seeing more than once.*Not to be confused with Robert Hanssen, the FBI agent who sold secrets to the Soviet Union.",The Frozen Ground
8,rmax304823,Hunting Allowed.,6,3 July 2015,"Nicholas Cage is an Alaskan State Trooper about to retire to milder climes, with the eager approval of his wife, Radha Mitchell. A case comes to him though. An Anchorage hooker, Vanessa Hudgens, is weeping at the police station, claiming she was kidnapped, bound, and about to be killed in the woods by a maniac. It was a miracle she escaped. A light bulb goes on in Cage's mind. This reminds him of a dozen unsolved cases involving disappearing hookers. His colleagues are not amused.Of course her story is real, and Cage's intuition is in proper working order. Those cases -- and many more -- are all linked because they were committed by the same lunatic serial killer, John Cusack.The police balk, Cage's State Troopers balk, the justice system balks, and there is too little evidence to pick up Cusack, who is, after all, a mild-mannered Anchorage baker. He's given to hunting trips in the far woods but what man in Alaska isn't? And everyone but Cage believes that Cusack's hunting territory and the burial grounds of some of the hookers is just a coincidence.So far, so good. Interesting fact-based story, professionally competent performers, and a sizable budget allowing for magnificent aerial shots of the gray, craggy, snowy mountains. The script and the director manage to turn it into something resembling an inexpensive, Canadian-made, feature on Lifetime Movie Network.I'll give just a few brief illustrations. Hudgens has escaped from Cusack's clutches but she has seen him and can identify him. Cusack knows this so he is prowling the streets of the bars and whorehouses where she hangs out, hoping somehow to kill her. Hudgens knows this, and so does Cage. So Cage takes her to the only place she'll be safe -- his own home. Then, in compliance with the usual formula, Cage's wife begins shouting at him. She wants to move, they've already sent out the required papers, she cares nothing about threatened whores, only about her own family. Why save a life when it interferes with your plans to move? But Radha Mitchell's protestations don't count for much because Hudgens gathers her stuff together, escapes from Cage's house, and returns to her old haunts in the red light district, although of course she knows Cusack is hunting her there. When she's hospitalized from a slight overdose of crack, an officer is assigned to protect her, but she escapes yet again from a place of safety. She becomes a pole dancer. She does everything but wear a neon bulls eye on her frame.The direction is okay except that once in a while, for no evident reason, the camera is made to wobble and focus on an unimportant image, or a pointless close up, as if this were a TV commercial for a brokerage firm.What keeps the movie going -- aside from its constant asking of the persistent question, ""How stupid can I get?"" -- are the performances. Some of the supporting cast are shaky, but Vanessa Hudgens as the young woman in jeopardy is not. Her turn is sterling. Nicholas Cage is surprisingly subdued. He's one of those actors who generally brings something extra to each role, but not here. He plays one note on his instrument, worried and a little angry. John Cusack is very good, once the script gives him a chance to unwind from his stereotypical part. His delivery in the interrogation room is smooth, passionate, and clumsy. (""You bring up this past-based stuff."") It's not a bad film, gloomy though it is. It's just that it could have been so much better with a bit of care.",The Frozen Ground
9,paul_haakonsen,The thaw is the killers worst enemy...,6,27 June 2016,"Now, I can't really claim to be much of a fan of Nicolas Cage, especially since his movies have an overwhelming tendency to be overly generic and come a dime a dozen. However, it was because of the synopsis and because of John Cusack that I decided to purchase this movie with the intend to watch it.And now having had the chance to sit down and watch it, I must say that I am actually genuinely surprised with the outcome of the movie. Not so much on John Cusack's deliverance, but because Nicolas Cage was actually fair in this movie, and he proved his worth opposite John Cusack. But to be blunt, then it was John Cusack who carried the movie and stood out in ""The Frozen Ground"".The story, which is based on real events, takes place in Alaska, where young women fall target and victim to a heinous abductor and serial killer.Nicolas Cage did a good enough job with his role as an officer of the law. But especially John Cusack was shining in this movie, in the role of the serial killer. There was just something deviant and cruel about his performance and portrayal of the Robert Hansen character. Vanessa Hudgens also did a good job with her acting and really did bring something to the movie.""The Frozen Ground"" turned out to be an enjoyable movie which, albeit following a straight forward script, did offer some good moments. And the characters in the movie seemed to be well-detailed and equally well brought to life on the screen by the acting talents.I am rating ""The Frozen Ground"" a solid six out of ten stars, and it is a movie that is well worth watching if you need some fair entertainment for a single viewing. The movie, however, doesn't really sustain more than a single viewing; you watch it once, then bag and tag it.",The Frozen Ground
10,Coventry,Daddy's gone a-hunting for lewd girls,7,31 March 2014,"There's only one type of movies that I personally appreciate even more than dark & disturbing horror films, and those are factual thrillers based on real-life serial killers. The reasons for this are simple; the disturbed minds of actual maniacs are often far more engrossing than anything scriptwriters could come up with and these films are almost automatically suspenseful & dramatic because you know it involved the suffering of real victims and their families. Some of the most harrowing and unpleasant films ever made are inspired by real serial killers, including ""Henry: Portrait of a serial killer"", ""The Honeymoon Killers"", ""10 Rillington Place"" and ""The Tenderness of Wolves"". Ever since I found out of its existence I wanted to see ""The Frozen Ground"" because this is also based on one of the most depraved killers in American history. Robert C. Hansen raped and murdered approximately 30 women in Alaska from the seventies until the early eighties. One of Hansen's peculiar trademarks included that he often took the girls to remote forestry locations, where he set them free and hunted them down like game. Debuting writer/director Scott Walker chose to stick very close to the facts, and wisely so. The events as they occurred are terrifying enough already and don't need any sensational twists or additional sub plots. ""The Frozen Ground"" begins with the discovery of a handcuffed and severely traumatized young girl named Cindy Paulson. Her escape and testimonies eventually led to Hansen's conviction, but the film specifically depicts that it took a frustratingly long time before the Alaska State Troopers could arrest him. In spite of several run-ins with the law before, Robert Hansen was considered a respectable citizen of Anchorage, with a lovely wife and two sons, while his victims were merely lewd girls.""The Frozen Ground"" isn't a very spectacular film, but it thrives on genuine tension and superior acting performances. The tension primarily comes from the facts, but also from the uniquely desolate Alaskan filming locations and weather conditions. I visited Alaska some years ago, including Anchorage and Seward, and – depending on the circumstances – it is either the most beautiful or the most sinister place on earth. In this case, it's sinister of course. For a debuting and inexperienced director like Scott Walker it also must have been amazing to be able to work with Nicolas Cage and John Cusack. Regardless of what anyone says, I still rank Cage among the greatest actors currently active, and his performance here is very subtle and professional. Even more impressive is Vanessa Hudgens' performance as the escaped victim Cindy Paulson. I never heard about Hudgens before, but apparently she's a former Disney Club starlet, so good for her that she demonstrates a wider range of talent. Perhaps the absolute most praiseworthy role comes from John Cusack. It's never easy to depict a serial killer but Cusack does it exactly right, as his performance of Robert Hansen effectively balances between intimidating and pitiable. The end credit bring a respectable tribute to the victims, that they may not be forgotten.",The Frozen Ground
11,michaelRokeefe,"An intense, formulaic sex crime drama.",8,16 October 2014,"Everyone knows that Nicolas Cage has had his share of bad and ho-hum movies. FROZEN GROUND lets him be himself, albeit obstinate and moody. This fact-base thriller has Cage playing an Alaska state trooper, Jack Holcombe. He temporarily puts off his retirement as he gets involved with the case of a 17-year-old-prostitute, Cyndy Paulson(Vanessa Hudgens), who escapes the heavy handed clutches of an infamous serial killer. Robert Hansen(John Cusack)abducts young women, in order to torture and sexually abuse them, before he kills them. Cyndy is the first to escape Hansen's lurid activities. Holcombe doesn't have enough evidence for a search warrant for Hansen's home, car and plane. He will need Cyndy's help, although her reputation of selling herself, being a junkie and haunted with trust issues, seems highly unreliable. Jack is dead serious about stopping the predator's stalking and killing.Cage is damn close to being at his best. But Ms. Hudgens, I think, really steals the show. She is surprisingly convincing in her role. Cusack is stellar. This movie is rated R for the violent content along with sexual themes and nudity. Filmed in Alaska, FROZEN GROUND has a supporting cast of: Dean Norris, Robert Forgit, Rahda Mitchell, Gia Mantegna and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe.",The Frozen Ground
12,sunwarrior13,A Tribute To Hansen's Victims,8,14 April 2014,"The Frozen Ground is a thriller based on the real-life hunt for serial killer Robert Hansen at Alaska during the 1980's.It was reported that the said serial killer has stalked and murdered between seventeen to twenty- one young women.Apparently,he would kidnap them and take them out to the wilderness where he shot and buried them.It stars Nicolas Cage as Sgt. Jack Halcombe,which was based on the character of Alaskan detective that captured the killer,Glenn Flothe; and John Cusack as Hansen himself.Vanessa Hudgens, Katherine LaNasa, Radha Mitchell and 50 Cent co- stars. This is a well-paced and engaging film feature.Despite the fact that the movie is something that we have already seen before in other thrillers and that it is far from being refreshing and original,we get to see great performances from both Cage and Cusack.It is also worth mentioning that it is a solid film and it will definitely provide a lot of thrills and entertainment to the viewer especially during Halcombe's investigation of the murders.But inspite of it,it falls short as there were a lot of plot holes like a character analysis of Hansen on his motive of committing those crimes as well as the other victims apart from Paulson.Too bad that it could have been better since this is obviously made as a lasting tribute to the victims of Hansen.",The Frozen Ground
13,Hey_Sweden,Cage and Cusack are worthy adversaries.,7,28 June 2017,"Inspired by the real life exploits of Alaska based serial killer Robert Hansen (played here by John Cusack), this is an okay thriller that pits the creepy Hansen against a dedicated State Trooper, Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage). Halcombe gets his big break when one young woman is able to escape Hansens' clutches. She is Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens), an underage prostitute.Much time is dedicated to the police procedural aspect to the story, as Halcombe and his many associates (played by Kevin Dunn, Dean Norris, Michael McGrady, Matt Gerald, and others) try to work within the law, and establish an airtight case. Hansen will prove to be a tough nut to crack, despite having a shady past, and it doesn't help that he's got this outward appearance of devoted family man and upstanding community member.Cage is effectively understated, with no trace of eccentricities. He's dead serious as this unsmiling cop protagonist. Cusack is likewise a model of subtlety in his performance. The supporting cast (Radha Mitchell, Kurt Fuller, Gia Mantegna, Brad William Henke, 50 Cent) is solid right down the line, although Mitchell gets little to do as Halcombes' wife. Hudgens does a respectable job as the haunted girl who's built up defense mechanisms to deal with a sad family history.The film gets most of its value from the Alaska setting (it was actually shot on location), which is simply full of atmosphere, beauty, and menace. It may also have some appeal for people who are interested in seeing the seedier environments of Anchorage.""The Frozen Ground"" is grim and pervasive, and will be hard for some viewers to take. But overall it's a well made and well acted film, that only begins to give one an idea of just how much carnage Hansen may have left in his wake.Seven out of 10.",The Frozen Ground
14,LeonLouisRicci,Noble-Semi-Failure,6,26 January 2014,"A Knee-Jerk Reaction might be to give Director Scott Walker Points for being so Sensitive and Empathetic to the Victims in this Real Life Serial Killer Story. But on Reflection it is this Tendency to not Exploit the Murders and the Rapes and the Kidnappings and the Torture and all the other Grisly Stuff that Really Happened, that make this a Noble Semi-Failure.The Movie is so Underplayed and Deliberately Unfocused on the Killer and the most Attention, by Design, is on the Bonding of a Cop and the only Victim who Managed to Escape, that it Never really gets the Adrenaline Flowing and the True Nature of the Evil being Presented is Lost in the Wilderness of its Restraint.With the Familiarity, although Insatiable, Appetites for these Lurid Events in the Culture and the Prolific Extent of its TV and Movie Incarnations, the Movie Mistakes and Missteps by taking the Palatable Path and that leaves the Impact of the Crimes Perhaps Less Affecting and Disipates the Horror it Deserves.Not a Bad Movie and it is Certainly Watchable, it will most Likely Appeal to those that find Appalling, Gory, Bloody, Murders and Gut-Wrenching Torture of Helpless Victims. But isn't that what Really Happened in Real Life. It is a rather Weak Argument that this is the Best way to go to Portray such Inhuman Behavior. It Borders on Sanitizing the Slaughter for Easily Digested, Popular Consumption. Do We really want to make this kind of Stuff Tasteful?",The Frozen Ground
15,zardoz-13,An Unsavory But Sizzling Serial Killer Saga With Cage and Cusack,8,10 November 2013,"Freshman New Zealand writer & director Scott Walker made a memorable motion picture debut with the serial killer thriller ""The Frozen Ground"" about the true life case of Alaskan murder Robert Hansen. When the authorities finally arrested the elusive Hansen, he confessed not only to killing as many as 17 women but also abducting and raping an additional 30 women. Ultimately, according to the film, Hansen received a 461 year sentence with no chance of parole. Nicolas Cage delivers a restrained, solemn performance as Jack Halcombe who doggedly led the investigation against Hansen. Halcombe was on the cusp of retirement from the Alaskan State Troopers when he cracked the case. He received a promotion to Commander of the Criminal Investigation Bureau and eventually retired. As the sadistic killer, John Cusack is just as solemn. He wears glasses and trolls for oral sex from prostitutes because he had too much respect for his wife to ask her to perform such an act. The Alaskan State Troopers obtained a search warrant for Hansen's residence, turned the place upside-down, and found a stash of weapons that matched the shell casings found at the frozen burial sites in the wilderness. The lynch pin of the investigation was a young, runaway prostitute, Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens of ""Spring Breakers""), who confronted him during Hansen's interrogation at police headquarters. After enduring hours of interrogation and denying everything that Halcombe and his investigators accused him of doing, Hansen blew his cool at the sight of Cindy and said that he should have killed her. This gripping but grisly yarn doesn't submerge us in the gritty details of Hansen's method of operation. Basically, ""The Frozen Ground"" is a cat and mouse game of wits that shuns sensationalism. Walker's film marked the second time that Cage and Cusack costarred in a film. Previously, Cusack played a U.S. Marshall, while Cage was cast as a convict awarded parole in ""Con Air"" (1997). Ironically, they reversed their roles here. Unless you like period crime thrillers, the suspense-laden ""Frozen Ground"" may not appeal to you. Although nobody gives a bad performance, actors and actresses like Radha Mitchell, who portrays Halcombe's long-suffering wife, and Curtis '50 Cents' Jackson, cast as Cindy's pimp, are confined to secondary supporting roles that rarely allow them to shine. Walker recreates successfully the 1980s when the crimes occurred. Lensed on location around Anchorage, Alaska, ""The Frozen Ground"" will send quiet chills down your spine.",The Frozen Ground
16,Calicodreamin,Could have been better,5,31 August 2020,"With a chilling true crime storyline and all star cast, this felt as if it should have been better.

Hansen, a successful businessman, is well connected and has escaped serious investigation for years despite being clearly in the frame.This is a relatively straightforward police procedural suspense thriller based on true events, with Nicolas Cage (cop) and John Cusack (killer) both cast in the roles one would normally expect to have been filled by the other. Cage is OK, Cusack is rather good. Vanessa Hudgens as teenage hooker Cindy is better than both of them: the girl can act. She can also swear a lot, but I already knew that from Spring Breakers.The sense of time and place is well evoked, and the film holds your attention for its full 105 minutes. The end credits start with a sobering and worthy runthrough of Hansen's real-life victims, and it is pleasing to note that Cindy escaped the life she had been leading.This is a decent film if, perhaps, not one which will stay in the memory for a long time.",The Frozen Ground

Based on real events.I wouldn't say there's anything that sets this film apart from others of its kind and it lacks intensity. It's good to see Nicolas Cage in a real role, he's more convincing than Cusack, but no performance really stood out. Radha Mitchell's given such a minor role for a quality actress, more of her and less of Hudgen's would of helped, I didn't much care for her.

19,phd_travel,"Good cast and interesting subject, bad directing and screenplay",5,12 September 2013,"As far as real life serial killer movies go, this one about Alaskan killer Robert Hansen has a good cast and a fascinating story. Unfortunately this one wasn't that well directed or written. Camera work wasn't good. Too much was in the dark or night with jerky closeup shots of people. Better when there were panoramic shots of Alaska. Too much time was spent on victim who got away Cindy Paulson's (Hudgens) angst. Having her run away from safety so many times got annoying. Seemed fake and contrived for dramatic effect and spoiled the believability of the movie. Her escape from Hansen was fragmented and muddled. The story should have been told in a more sequential manner for full impact. The flashbacks weren't differentiated well from the present so it felt confusing in an unnecessary way.Despite the weakness in screenplay and directing, the story of the killer is fascinating because it is so bizarre especially the hunting of his victims. Hudgens acts well in a torrid dramatic role - something none of her high school musical castmates have achieved to date. But making her run away so often makes her irritating and her character does not evoke sympathy. John Cusack is cast against type as killer Hansen. Somehow he doesn't seem that sinister - too clean cut. Could have looked a bit more evil. Nicholas Cage acts well as the dedicated person who catches Hansen. There are other movies about other famous serial killers that are made in a more straightforward and therefore effective manner. ""To Catch a Killer"" with Brian Dennehy about John Gacy was much scarier. Even the cheaper TV movies about Bundy have more impact.A bit of a waste but still worth a watch for the subject matter.",The Frozen Ground
20,Wuchakk,Cage tracks down real-life Alaskan serial killer,7,27 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 2013 and written & directed by Scott Walker, ""The Frozen Ground"" is a crime thriller based on the true story of Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen, who raped, tortured and killed numerous young women from 1971-1983. Vanessa Hudgens plays a 17 year-old prostitute who successfully escaped from Hansen (John Cusack). Nicolas Cage plays the trooper who establishes a relationship with her as he zeroes-in on Hansen. This has elements like ""Kiss the Girls"" (1997), ""The Flock"" (2007) and ""Hardcore"" (1979). If you like those crime thrillers, you'll appreciate this one. The Anchorage locations are perpetually overcast, but breathtaking and foreboding. Cusack is notable as the average-looking killer and Cage is stalwart as usual. The events take place in 1983 when anchorage was booming due to the pipeline and the ensuing sex industry. The scenes depicting the sleazy underbelly of the city (at that time) are well done and convincing. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 45 minutes and was shot entirely in Alaska. GRADE: B",The Frozen Ground
21,mm-39,not bad!,7,14 September 2014,"Surprisingly okay! The movie left the theatre so fast I thought Frozen Ground was another Cage bust. What worked! Cusack created an excellent portrayal of a serial killer. The mannerism of Cusack was terrifying. Cage has another strong performance as a caring cop. He is type casted with this role. The story was riveting and unravelled in well timed layers. What did not work: The many serial killer/cop movies have become redundant. The cop genre needs to reinvent itself. Not the best movie, but okay. Six or seven out of ten. I wonder if Cage will try a different role for a change? Cage needs to try a different role! Cage's role in this movie was almost like his private detective role in 8 mm. Time to get out of the box Cage.",The Frozen Ground
22,SimonJack,Based on the true story of the Alaska serial killer convicted in 1983,6,21 September 2020,"""The Frozen Ground"" is based on a true story about the 1983 apprehension and conviction of Robert Hansen, an Alasaka serial killer. Hansen confessed to raping and killing 17 young women over a 12-year period. He was a baker in Anchorage who was married and had two children with his second wife. He was adept at hunting, with archery as well as rifles. He also flew light aircraft and had a plane. After his arrest and conviction Hansen became known in the press as the ""butcher baker."" He was convicted of four murders along with other charges, and spent the rest of his life, from 1983 to his death in 2014, in prison.As a crime and suspense ""thriller,"" this is a gruesome film. It doesn't have the gore, blood and guts that so many films in the horror genre have, but a disquieting pale haunts this film. It shows one incident of Hansen's modus operandi. He would lure young women by promising them photo shoots. After raping his victims, he would force them into his plane and then fly them into the bush country. He would release them, and as they fled he would hunt them down and shoot them with a rifle.Since most of Hansen's victims were prostitutes, their disappearances were seldom reported or even seemed unusual. The film shows how a State Trooper, Sgt. Jack Halcombe, eventually uncovered the connection between bodies of murdered women that had been found over a few years.The cast are good, but as noted, a heavy pale seems to hang over this film. Nicolas Cage plays Sgt. Halcombe and John Cusak plays Hansen. The movie was filmed in Alaska over a 26-day period. But, what is strange was the film's theater release. It was first released on Feb. 1, 2013, in Brazil. Then it opened in European countries in July. Its release in Canada was on Aug. 22, and in the U.S. on Aug. 23.The film had a staggering budget of more than $19 million, but its worldwide gross at the box office was only $5.6 million. I first saw the film in the theater, and watched it again recently. I wondered at the apparent low public interest in a crime thriller of a serial killer, especially since some very gory horror films have huge box office sales. By comparison, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" of 1974 had a worldwide box office of $107 million. And, the 2005 fictional horror film, ""Saw II,"" had a worldwide box office of $148 - from a budget of just $4 million.This isn't a film that audiences might find enjoyable or entertaining It would be of interest to those who work in the crime and police fields, and related professions. Others of us like to see how notorious crimes are solved. Those in one of these fields should find the film interesting.",The Frozen Ground
23,siderite,Decent obsessive detective story,8,23 February 2014,"If you want someone to play a detective obsessed with catching a serial killer, it is hard to get someone more suitable than Nicolas Cage. In this film he is somewhere in Alaska, two weeks from leaving his job at the nagging of his wife, interpreted by Radha Mitchell, who plays a tiny role. He is assigned to a case that involves a creepy serial rapist and sadistic killer. John Cusack is a good match for that, too.The movie manages to keep the viewer interested by always putting the life of a young surviving victim in jeopardy. It's usually her fault and Cage has to stop whatever he is doing to help her out. Also the film is good at making the viewer feel the frustration of the police officers who are shackled by procedure and rules that allow the killer to just continue to murder with impunity.And therein lies the beauty and fault of the film, which is based on real events. In a way it was a classically made film, a naive one, but realistic. The policeman is a normal guy. The prostitute is a normal girl. The wife is as normal as they get. The killer is not only methodical, sadistic and creepy, but also arrogant and stupid. The real enemy, the thing that stops the hero to get his killer is not the brilliance of the bad guy, but the slow and imperfect system that ties the detective's hands even when he knows who the murderer is.It is not difficult to understand the insanity that is ascribed to policemen after being on the job for a while. They go mad with frustration, especially if they are the kind of people who want to do their duty to serve and protect.Bottom line: it's not a fantastic film, it has nothing new, but I liked it and I respect it and its makers. It wasn't a sensation film, not an edge of the seat thing, but rather a realistic depiction of the normal ugliness of the world around. Worth a watch.",The Frozen Ground

26,Hellmant,Cage definitely shines once again.,7,7 October 2013,"'THE FROZEN GROUND': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Routine serial killer thriller (based on actual events) that's highlighted by effective directing and topnotch performances. The film was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Scott Walker and based on the real life 1980's manhunt for serial killer Robert Hansen. It's set in Alaska and revolves around the detective pursuing Hansen and his latest victim; who escaped his clutches and is now helping the detective (reluctantly) with his case. The film stars Nicolas Cage as the detective, John Cusack as the serial killer and Vanessa Hudgens as the young witness. Rapper 50 Cent also makes an appearance in the film, as a pimp, and was one of the movie's producers.Cage plays Sgt. Jack Halcombe in the film (who is based on detective Glenn Flothe). He's assigned to track down an Alaskan serial killer who has been kidnapping and killing women (in the Alaskan wilderness) for 13 years. Cindy Paulson (Hudgens) is a 17-year-old stripper/hooker who was kidnapped by the killer but managed to escape. The police don't believe her story though; when she comes to them and identifies Robert Hansen (Cusack) as her abductor. When Halcombe figures out Cindy matches the pattern of the other killer's victims he tracks her down and begs for her assistance in bringing Hansen to justice. An odd relationship develops as Cindy finally finds someone she can trust, in Halcombe.The film is pretty by the numbers but like I said the performances are great and Walker makes an impressive directorial debut. Cage is a good actor that makes a lot of bad films but here he definitely shines once again. This is the second time Cusack has played a crazy killer in as many years (after last year's 'THE PAPERBOY') and it's a nice change of pace for him (he makes a great creepy maniac). Hudgens is especially impressive here because I've never thought of her as much of an actress but she blends into this part pretty well. There's nothing new or original that this film has to offer but it's still an entertaining and involving film, due to the overall quality of it's production.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQkUJbRVsoM",The Frozen Ground
27,Robert_duder,Not my week for films,4,30 September 2013,"Ho hum. I actually heard some positive things about The Frozen Ground and I was excited to see it because I enjoy both Nicholas Cage and John Cusack and both have actually had some luck with solid straight to DVD entries in the last little while. I mean, The Frozen Ground wasn't terrible but it is far from good too. It feels like its in a perpetual spiral and doesn't know what it wants to be or where it wants to go. The pacing is completely off and it feels like the editor of the film bailed before finishing. There are many, many scenes completely unnecessary to the movie that you keep wondering where they are going with this. This presents itself like a cat and mouse game of cop vs serial killer and based on a true story. They force the additional story about the Prostitute turned stripper into your face and it just gets confusing and honestly downright silly at times. Yes, I understand her involvement but do we need to see HER life spiralling when this is about capturing a serial killer. Sometimes I thought the film was trying too hard and then I discovered it was more likely that the film maker wasn't trying hard enough. It was a rush job with wasted talent and concept forced out to make a quick buck. There are several scenes where Cage is ""debriefed"" with facts about the case and they are shotgunned out one after another sounding cold and quite frankly boring. This is a fairly easy genre to capture I think. With a good cast and even the faintest hint of a decent script you can create an intense crime thriller, but poor direction and pacing drags this down.Love him or hate him Nicholas Cage is usually a huge draw at the movies. I certainly don't hate him, he's done some first rate movies and I usually enjoy his work. The first half of this movie he seems to sense that its not very good. He seems almost bored with the dialogue and complete lack of decent story. He does absolutely hit a better stride in the latter half of the film when he actually shows the type of charisma on screen that we know him for. John Cusack has always been high up my list of favourites. He is decent in his role as deranged kidnapper and rapist Bob Hansen. He is sort of quiet and subtle and I think I wanted more of a two faced performance from him because I think he could have really knocked this out of the part but his role feels a little blasé and that's unfortunate. I think the chemistry between Cage and Cusack should have been terrific (Remember Con-Air?) but it ends up being just okay at best and that hurts the film even further. Dean Norris (really becoming a fan of this guy) is sadly underused in the film and is reduced to being a sidekick that doesn't say much and has no depth whatsoever. As many reviewers are saying the surprise performance of this film is absolutely Vanessa Hudgens. She is very nearly brilliant in a role that is unfortunately overused and gives her character more than what is necessary. But she makes her role very believable and gives a terrific performance. Still doesn't redeem her for making Spring Breakers. I suppose I should mention Brad Henke as well as he gets a fairly significant character development near the end but he does virtually nothing with it and its another pointless character.And my rule of thumb wins out yet again. 99% of writers and directors should NOT write or direct their own stuff. Scott Walker has absolutely no prior experience and it shows. I don't know how these people get potentially good scripts and decent casts when they have no experience directing or writing in this case. Set in Alaska this should have had a distinctively cold and gritty feel to it. Emotions should have ran high and it should have been a solid thriller but it wasn't hardly any of that. I will say that the latter half of the film is a lot better and the pacing finds its footing but that's also when they throw the accomplice angle at you which I thought was unnecessary and dumb. And then to run down the known victims and dedicate the film to all the victims seemed really morbid and unnecessary being it was so poorly put together. There are simply much better films out there in the genre. I watched this very shortly after having seen a superbly crafted crime thriller like Prisoners so this to me is completely forgettable and not worth the time at all. 4/10",The Frozen Ground
28,Lejink,Outrage in Anchorage,6,13 July 2014,"Based on the true-life crimes of serial-killer Robert Hansen, this was a serviceable if occasionally clichéd thriller pitting Nicholas Cage's State Trooper cop against John Cusack's pillar-of-the-community with a dark secret.I didn't think the film quite got the mix right between respecting the unspeakable horror of Hansen's crimes with the conventions of a blockbuster Hollywood crime movie, although at least some effort was made, none more so than the solemn gallery of the images of Hansen's real victims as the last scene ends. Elsewhere though there were apparent fictional set-ups of climactic near-misses (as when Hansen follows his 17 year-old near- victim and now key witness into a strip joint) and contrived set-ups (the way he magically locates said victim just by driving around the busy street at night) and of course the development of the working relationship between good-cop Cage and the young girl which naturally starts frosty but turns when they share remembrances of past losses.The movie doesn't present itself as a whodunit, introducing Cusack's psycho-killer right away as the perpetrator, perhaps in deference to his co-star billing as much as anything but may have played with a touch of mystery and suspense about it. Cage and Cusack (who does bear a reasonable resemblance to the killer Hansen) are good in their lead parts and it's their playing that largely carries the film.The direction was okay, the story was reasonably well told but was largely devoid of major shocks and surprises or of course a real twist to set it apart from the pack. Shot in a grainy almost monotone style, with, as ever, are numerous establishing shots of Alaska's frozen wastes, I could have done without the heavy alternative rock music which passes for a soundtrack in so many modern movies. All told, though, this was a slightly above average thriller bringing to light a terrible story from Alaska's recent past.",The Frozen Ground
29,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A true life thriller with a lot of potential but not the sum of it's parts,7,1 March 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe true life story of Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage), an Alaskan detective who believes he is closing in on Robert Hansen (John Cusack) a man with a past who he believes is behind a series of missing girls, but red tape and bureaucracy from the top are preventing him from doing this. However, he encounters Cindy (Vanessa Hudgens) a prostitute who claims she escaped from Hansen's clutches, who he believes provides a plausible version of events, and together they must work to catch him before he strikes again.Short of remaking or adapting a compelling thriller, sometimes you can tap from the source of true life and generate a pretty decent, riveting yarn. The Frozen Ground, based on true events in Alaska in the early 1980's, certainly has bags of potential and for the most part does draw you in, but inexperience behind the scenes perhaps rears it's ugly head and prevents it from being the sum of it's parts.Debut feature length director Scott Walker has a solid template to spin from, but he seems to have latched on to the modern reverse story telling trend, throwing up the back story of the lead girl's former exploits before landing in the serial killer's clutches in with present events, but the result is a frustrating, unfocused and slightly incoherent film that ends up suffering from pace problems. Somehow, the end pay off is no less dynamic and spurring as a result, but it's a shame the path it took to get there. It's Walker's debut film, and it's the work of someone who needs a bit more practise to get his craft just right.For the most part, though, it's pretty spot on. The beautiful white, icy glacial mountain peaks of Alaska are used to dark effect as the cold, dark night sky draws in, and there are reliably stellar, powerhouse performances from leads Cage and Cusack, especially loathsome as the cold, sadistic killer, who you, perhaps unsurprisingly, hate even more since he's based on a true life incarnation, not to mention Hudgens as the damaged, but resilient young girl who becomes the saviour of the day. You just can't help but feel a more mature, experienced hand would have been better suited to the material. ***",The Frozen Ground
30,MOscarbradley,Unusual setting but largely mediocre.,3,13 February 2020,"""The Frozen Ground"" is an Alaska-set serial killer movie that might have been a lot better if director Scott Walker hadn't gone overboard with a roving camera that never sits still together with some very flashy editing. This is kinetic movie-making of the worst kind. It's also not that easy to follow as Walker never keeps his camera in the one place long enough for us to get a handle on what's happening and his use of flashbacks only adds to the confusion.John Cusack is the serial killer and Nicolas Cage, the cop who is tracking him and it's based on fact. Cage is less mannered than usual and Cusack seems to be building up something of a profile playing murderous scumbags. Since we know who the killer is from the start there is no real suspense and the performances are largely unconvincing. Only the chilly locations prove to be a point of interest.",The Frozen Ground
31,bowmanblue,"An understated, no-frills cop movie",7,17 November 2014,"Do you like cop films that are filled with tension, plenty of explosive car chases, blazing shoot-outs and finally the hero lawman confronting the evil serial killer on top of a highrise block of flats? If the answer is 'yes' then you probably won't like 'The Frozen Ground.' It's based on a true account of the police's attempt to apprehend a serial killer in Alaska in the early eighties. And, basically, it's a lot more 'real' than your average cop vs serial killer film. Nicholas Cage plays the cop and he spends much of the film interviewing witnesses, sitting behind a desk and trying to persuade judges that John Cussack is their man.It's hardly a thrill-seeking roller-coaster of a story, but, if you're in the mood for something a little more realistic then you might enjoy this. All the performances are good and the cold, foreboding Alaskan setting adds a nice eerie ambiance. You could almost look at it as more of a documentary than a thriller, so, if a low-key crime drama is what you're looking for then give this one a go.",The Frozen Ground
32,dromasca,murders in the cold,6,20 August 2018,"Having any of Nicolas Cage or John Cusack in the cast is enough to make me curious to see a movie in which one of them appears,even more when they play together, so I did not have much hesitation in deciding to see 'The Frozen Ground' despite the rather unfortunate cinematic experiences I have had in recent years with the bizarre roles chosen by Nicolas Cage. Critics and viewers who rate movies on IMDB have not even been enthusiastic either, and yet Scott Walker's film (at his first and only feature film so far, also the script writer) did not disappoint me.'The Frozen Ground' is based on true crime cases in Alaska in the 1970s and 1980s telling the story of the investigation that led to the arrest of a serial killer and rapist named Robert Hansen (the role played by John Cusack in the film). It is one of those cases where the criminal is known to the audience since the beginning of the film, and the story focuses on the details of the investigation and the legal and procedural aspects that allow the suspect to be arrested and accused. The suspect was apparently what is called a ""normative citizen"" and the American legal system as well as the social conveniences were on his side. The investigation conducted by the police officer (played by Nicolas Cage) had as witness a young prostitute, whose testimony was questionable because of her social status. Reality does not always provide enough real data for fiction films, and some more fiction should be built around it. In this case, screen writer Scott Walker focused on the relationship and confidence building between the policeman and the only surviving victim of the criminal who kidnapped, raped and murdered young women.The criminal procedural elements in 'The Frozen Ground' are quite trivial and familiar to viewers from many other similar movies. The film, however, manages to remain on a decent level with a well-built action, with a realistic description of the violent and corrupt environment of the Alaskan border towns during the oil boom, with the cinematography of the frozen landscapes where some of the victims end their lives in a horrific manner. Nicolas Cage acts low key, somehow in a monotonous manner, in the role of the dedicated policeman with a soul, John Cusack has to small a role for an actor of his caliber, but it is worthwhile waiting for the scene of the interrogation at the end of the movie that brings the two together on the screen. Vanessa Hudgens is the acting revelation, as the young vulnerable woman, victim of family and social traumas, and succeeds be on screen more than just a victimized woman. Without any significant sparks, 'The Frozen Ground' is a more than just another true crime docu-drama and watching it is no wasted time.",The Frozen Ground

It bites and penetrates into your bones, and just watching the movie makes you happy, possibly on a subliminal basis, that you do not live in Alaska. Cage is good but its always the same role for him, in different variants. Radha Mitchell is wasted. Cusack, whose press kit describes him as the hardest working actor in Hollywood, is as good as one can be when faced with a weak script and a director who is not sure if he is filming an historical mystery or a live ""rescue the damsel in distress"" chase film. Fans of Hudgens will be tickled to know that she is trying to evolve into a mature actress, with some success. Her performance is uneven, but this could be as much the fault of the director as the actress. Overall not worth recommending, the film never connects with the audience, not once. To date the best serial killer roles remain Brian Dennehy in the 1992 Gacy TV movie and Tony Curtis, who set the bar, in the original Boston Stranger.",The Frozen Ground

She has been dead for at least six months and some body parts are missing. Nevertheless, an identification is made. Since the area is not accessible by roads, most hunters flying into on small planes, this is puzzling. How did she get here? By chance, a state trooper, Jack (Nicolas Cage) is on the verge of moving to the lower 48 when HE is asked to interview a hooker who says a man tried to kidnap her and fly her to a remote area. Shaking and crying, Cindy (Vanessa Hudgens) tells a twisted tale of a man offering her $200 for her services. Yet, once at his home, he chained her in the basement, raped her, and then proceeded to tell her they were going to board his small plane and fly his cabin in the woods. Sensing she would never return, Cindy bolted bravely away and flagged down a truck driver. Now, she's terrified. But, Jack asks her, could she identify the plane at the nearby airport? She does so. As it happens, the plane belongs to a respectable baker, Robert Hanson (John Cusack) who is also married with two young children. Could this truly be the evil man? There is little evidence and Cindy suddenly vanishes from sight, yet she is alive and dancing at a closed club in town. Trooper Jack does his research and finds there have been several women found dead under similar circumstances, all of them hookers or vagrants. Piecing things together, Jack does feel that the spectacled Hanson is a dangerous serial killer. Can he uncover enough evidence to arrest him? Not without a lot of detective work, making his wife unhappy that there move is delayed. But, with lives at stake, Jack feels he must race against time before someone else is killed. This dark, disturbing film is unsettling and, at times, quite violent. It is not for everyone and definitely not for anyone but adults. Yet, with Cage and Cusack doing fine work and Hudgens adding her nice performance, it is worthwhile for those who can stomach it. The Alaska scenery is alternately breathtaking and seedy, for the wilds are beautiful but Anchorage has a district for strip joints and hookers to walk the street. Naturally, there are also parts of extreme tension, so pulses will race. All in all, this is an admirable thriller, not greatly distinguished, but capable to fascinate viewers indeed.",The Frozen Ground

36,callanvass,Not very interesting to be honest with you,4,19 November 2013,"This is based on a true story. It takes place in a VERY cold place called Alaska. Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage) helps a young prostitute who is deeply unfulfilled. She escaped the dangerous clutches of a notorious serial killer Robert Hansen (John Cusack) Jack partners up with the young prostitute to not only try and help out her personal life, but take down Robert Hansen as well. Boring, boring, boring; that's what kept popping up in my head while viewing this movie. The entire experience was deadening for me. It had a great chance to capitalize on a terrific setting with some good atmosphere, but they absolutely blew it. This is akin back to the days of serial killer flicks by being old fashioned in its approach, but it forgot to add one main ingredient, and that's entertainment. The most powerful thing about this movie is not the chase of Robert Hansen, but Vanessa Hudgens fantastic portrayal of Cindy Paulson. Forget High School Musical. That's not gonna enter your mind at all during this movie. She feels like a seasoned veteran with how well she did. She conveys all her emotions to perfection, and she was by far the most interesting thing in this film. I felt like jumping through the screen to try and help the poor girl. She uses drugs, smokes cigarettes, drinks, she does it all. This girl is going places. She's immensely talented. Nicolas Cage is actually a favorite of mine. Ever since he ran into money problems, he's made some mediocre things. It's really frustrating because Nic Cage is a one of a kind actor, who is capable of so much. He looks bored to death in this movie. Perhaps he was trying to underplay it, but he was TOO low-key. Only in the finale does the patented Cage intensity, come out to play. It was rather disappointing. John Cusack is another favorite of mine. He actually does very well as the serial killer, with some great scenes at the end. Radha Mitchell has barely anything to do as Cage's wife. 50 Cent has an embarrassing looking wig on. P.S. If you happen to actually enjoy this movie. There is some interesting facts about the real life events at the end credits. Final Thoughts: I didn't care for it all. It's another recent dud from Cage. If you've remained loyal to Cage like I have over the years, give it a whirl, but don't be surprised if you wished you didn't.

Unfortunately this story was inspired from a real incident.This movie is definitely worth seeing but not a box office hit. And also a typical Hollywood story presentation spoilt it. In other side it lacks in intellectual cat-mouse chase between good and bad which were very essential for a movie to make a big commercial success.

39,eddie_baggins,An average thriller that wastes it potential,4,29 January 2014,"You will learn a couple if things from watching The Frozen Ground, a few of them being in no particular order – first time director Scott Walker certainly loves his helicopter shots with Around 5 – 10 minutes of total screen time seemingly dedicated to them, poor old Vanessa Hudgens is hellbent on shedding her Disney image and has a case of the try hards and the actual movie of this horrific true life story could of been a whole lot better.The Frozen Ground had a decent sized budget and an intriguing cast so it's strange that the whole affair feels so cheap and nasty. Releasing direct to DVD here in Australia and barely making a ripple any where else in the world, it's not hard to see why the movie failed to connect or find an audience. To go along with this cheap overall feel the central characters in the piece in no way engage any audience spite, connection or affection. Cage is cold as trooper Jack, Hudgens misses the mark badly with her tough luck hooker Cindy and Cusack, while having some moments as creepy Robert is in the end a stock standard movie killer. Other supporting characters such as Breaking Bad's Dean Norris and an atrocious 50 Cent as the worst screen pimp in recent memory don't ad anything to proceedings either.The failings of the central actors in the movie go hand in hand with the failings of the movie to capitalize in a narrative term on the real life case. Great serial killer/investigation procedural make the audience feel apart of the discovery and detective work but Frozen Ground never even attempts to really engage this. Too much of the movie focuses on the interaction between Jack and Cindy and not near enough time spent on any of the mystery that was once prevalent in the case. More time spent on this and one could see just how tense and involving the film could of been.It's a shame that first time director Walker didn't get this movie out of first gear as it's clear he has a strong passion for the horrific and interesting real life story but that does not make a good film. There are small moments of the film that suggest somewhere there was a Zodiac like movie to be made but the finished product got about what it deserved, an appearance and eventual disappearance like frozen ice in the sun.2 Hank's out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",The Frozen Ground

With the daylight at little as possible that makes the film much more gloomy then the actual and real story that took place for some 12 years-from 1971 to 1983-that its about. What the film is about is a Ted Bundy like killer who targeted women as if they were wild game kidnapping raping and then flying, in his private plane, them out into the woods and letting them loose for him to hunt down and kill them.There's no secret to who the killer is upstanding citizen husband & father Robert Hansen,John Cusack, who's got this thing about women that he has to act out in killing them. That's because of an unfortunate experience he had in his youth when he was soundly rejected, in trying to make out, by them. Masking his violent hatred of the opposite sex Hansen went as far as getting married to look normal as a loving and bible thumping family man married with two children but use that as a front to hide what he's really all about. It's Alasken state trooper Jack Halcombe, Nicolas Cage, who connects the dotes in a number of murders that were committed over the last 12 years to finally track Hansen down.***SPOILERS*** The key piece of the puzzle to Hansen's killing spree is 17 year old runaway prostitute Cindy Paulson, Vanessa Hudgens, who was kidnapped by Hansen but escaped to tell about it as well as identify him. With no help at all from the local Anchorage Alasken police Halcombe went out on his own to not only track down Hansen, whom he knew were he was, but uncover the evidence that could convict him. This has Hansen go for broke in trying to find and murder Cindy to keep her mouth shut. Going so far as getting Cindy's pimp Clate Johnson, 50 Cent, whom he later had murdered to turn her over to him for special treatment. It was in losing his cool it's Hansen who under relentless interrogation by Halcombe who finally cracked and admitted his guilt just after Cindy was brought into the interrogation room to identify him as her kidnapper.

41,leonblackwood,Intense Drama! 5/10,5,18 January 2014,"Review: This is quite a deep true story of a serial rapist and murderer. Although the storyline is quite touching and disturbing, the director made a basic movie to portray the storyline. It's not that the actors didn't put in a good performance, I think that the problem is that we have seen this type of film many times before. You do end up sticking with the film to see how it pans out, but the intensity was deep enough for such a story. All of the actors had a chance to make this a brilliant movie, but all of the performances were very average. It seemed like it could have made a better documentary than a movie, but if they gave this storyline to a major director I do think that they could have done a better job. That's not to say that the movie is bad, but it could have been much better. Watchable!Round-Up: There would have been a time when Nicolas Cage's name was enough to sell a movie and make it a blockbuster, but those days have truly gone. The movie had all of the right ingredients, but it wasn't really executed well. John Cusack has been playing a lot of baddies lately and he seemed to suit his parts well, but he never does anything out of the box. That's not to say he is a bad actor, but he just acts the same in all of his roles. Nicolas Cage is also very basic in this film and you don't really get a chance to get to know his character. Apart from that, the actually story does make you want to look into the the true events, and the ending really brings to light how sick the real situations really was.Budget: $27million Worldwide Gross: $5million (Terrible!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there intense serial killer dramas about true events that happened in Alaska in the 80's. 5/10",The Frozen Ground
42,billcr12,Contrived,5,31 August 2013,"The title refers to the frozen ground of Alaska, where Robert Hansen buried multiple women after shooting them in the wilderness. John Cusack is sufficiently spooky, but he is not on screen much until the final moments. Nicholas Cage is his usual low key self as the cop leading the investigation, and Vanessa Hudgens rounds out a solid cast, as a prostitute who escapes Hansen, and is needed as a witness against him. The problem lies in the focus on her, instead of on Hansen, who is a much more interesting person. The script is extremely contrived, with Cage becoming the guardian angel of Hudgens. We have seen it too many times before, and I was bored to death after one hour and forty five minutes. I just watched The Iceman, and the filmmakers stay on Kuklinski for most of the movie, which is the way The Frozen Ground should have been made. It is a 5/10 only because of the good acting by Cage, Cusack, and Hudgens.",The Frozen Ground
43,BeneCumb,Aridity due to seek for realism - apparently,7,13 November 2013,"It is difficult to create a thriller if based on real events and everyone knows in advance who the evildoer is - then part of the thrill is unavailable and you have to follow the police hunting the certain person (and you know how it all ends). ""Human"" approach adds some touch, and there are some twists included, but it is still more a documentary than a catchy feature movie. Luckily, the cast is above average, and actors like Nicholas Cage, John Cusack and Vanessa Hudgens give decent performances, and the beautiful nature of Alaska (not often depicted in the U.S. movies) acts as a supporting actor. All in all, an above-average, authentic crime movie through which viewers get overview of how a serial killer was caught.",The Frozen Ground

Obviously, there was NO need to even make THE FROZEN GROUND in the first place, since this disturbing territory already had been covered so thoroughly. (Christopher Nolan's 2002 Snoozer starring Al Pacino as the hotshot detective was, in fact, a remake itself of a 1997 Scandanavian film; Nolan seemingly proved for all time that crime stories based in Alaska are doomed to be b-o-r-i-n-g). When Nicolas Cage has starred in a movie for the past 20 years, there's a 67% chance that it will be a bomb, and THE FROZEN GROUND (not to be confused with the excellent Melissa Leo film, FROZEN RIVER) is no exception to the ""Caged-cooled"" rule. If the plot of THE FROZEN GROUND interests you, watch Thom Eberhardt's 2007 flick, NAKED FEAR, instead. Not only are the victims in the buff (it's New Mexico, NOT Alaska, after all), but the chicks have a fighting chance! Baker Bob shoots the proverbial ""fish a barrel""--BOO!

45,XweAponX,One of the better Nicolas Cage offerings of this decade,10,20 June 2018,"I actually enjoyed his first ghost rider episode rather than his second, even though I love Neveldine/Taylor's work especially in Gamer and the Chelios ""Crank"" duology. But this one is a nice authentic murder mystery and I love films that take place in Alaska. And I don't remember seeing John Cusack play a really nasty bad guy as well as he does here, the creepiness makes me shiver: and the character is doubly malicious as he is hiding behind the guise of a righteous, Christian individual- A facade that hides more evil in this modern age than any other. One of Paul Verhoeven's character actors, Dean Norris takes on more than just a background cameo role to actively assist Nicolas Cage character which appears to be a State Trooper Sergeant . And I do believe there is a Radha Mitchell in the house, who has not aged since she was gobbled up by blind monsters in Pitch Black. Very nice, I enjoyed this quite a lot thank you. Vanessa Hudgens (from machete kills) didn't really stand out but she did have the character perfectly, and by watching her performance we can understand why some women do not speak up when abused or threatened. Like, what good would it do? And apparently based on a true story. As hideous and gruesome as this film is, it is no match to the original events on which it is based.",The Frozen Ground

But that is only one of the weaknesses of this film. Revealing the identity of the serial killer in the first fifteen minutes or so does not help the plot as well. The performances of the leading actors are both professional and well-intended, but not enough to save the script and the screenplay, which were fatally flawed. There is little suspense in the cat and mouse plot; better to not know who the mouse is (see The Zodiac Killer). And if you do pursue the cat and mouse game; it should be done more like Law-Abiding Citizen, which keeps you in suspense despite knowing the identity of the antagonist.

In Alaska a serial killer stalks, rapes & kills girls but one manages to escape & survive, now a soon to be retired Detective looks into the case & re-opens some old ones to finally catch this evil monster!!!
Nicolas Cage is an excellent actor but he's in so many straight to dvd B-flicks lately that his good ones go practically unnoticed & unseen but ""The Frozen Ground"" is one his very good films, I've always liked Nick Cage from his 90's hey days but like most big leading stars, they have their time & then settle for more cheap low budget flicks, but that doesn't mean the performances are always bad & Cage can still deliver as he did here with an excellent & powerful performance as Detective Jack Halcombe & his character is a good hearted family man who is absolutely disgusted at this serial killer is still out there doing his sick stuff, it's a powerful performance that reminded me of my favourite Cage film, the 90's Scary Dark Thriller ""8MM"" & this movie treads similar ground & enters very dark territory.
John Cusack gives a terrifying & extremely detached & cold performance as real life serial killer ""Robert Hansen"" & the young girl who escaped his clutches ""Cindy Paulson"" is played by Vanessa Hudgens & also gives an incredible, vulnerable & heart breaking performance!!!
The real life snow filled & dreary Alaskan backdrop is dreary & depressing with the real ice cold atmosphere & look.
""The Frozen Ground"" is a gripping & incredibly intense Thriller but also a really sad, disturbing & heart breaking movie too, for this did happen & that's very frightening as we know real life is always scarier than the movies but this film captures the Terrifying feel of it's time during the early 80's & the dark & dim cinematography adds to tone of despair & Horror.

49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Paced, chilling true story",8,12 August 2015,"The Frozen Ground is a chilling, down to earth, somber true crime story set in the slimy underbelly of Anchorage, and the ice tundras of the rural Alaskan areas. Nicolas Cage turns off the ham and plays it straight as Alaska State Trooper Jack Halcombe. When a terrified 17 year old prostitute (Vanessa Hudgens) is discovered chained up in an abandoned apartment, she tells authorities a wild tale of how she was abducted, tortured and almost killed by a madman. The only problem: this madman is Robert Hansen (John Cusack), a respected business owner and family man without a ghost of a criminal record. No proof can be found, no one believes the poor strung out girl, and the trail goes cold. But not for Halcombe. He doggedly pursues lead after lead, forming a shaky bond with Hudgens to go after Hansen and prove what he suspects, and is true: Hansen is a twisted serial killer guilty of over a dozen unsolved murders. The film drops cheap tricks and settles into an unconventionally paced, straightfaced, scary account of catching this monster. Cage is excellent as the determined trooper who uses keen intellect and unflinching pathos to flush Hansen out. Cusack is creepy as hell, worming his way into your psyche with his dank, vile characterization, it's the scariest work I've ever seen from him. The performance of the film comes from Hudgens though. She brings bruised, hardened heart to the role, objectively playing this broken, lost soul with a doe eyed, fearless frenzy that I didn't know she was capable of. There's a subtle bunch of supporting cameos, including Jodi Lynn O Keefe, Dean Norris, Michael Mcgrady, Brad William Henke, Radha Mitchell, Kevin Dunn, and 50 Cent wearing a ridiculous mullet. It's an icy slow burner, almost like the moody 1970's procedural, with a laconic pace all its own that nicely sets it apart from other similar movies. It also gives fair tribute to the real life victims and their families, never deviating into exploitation or wanton carnage, but always maintaining a frank, earnest, up front mentality that often is scarily similar to real life. Definitely worth checking out.",The Frozen Ground
50,peterp-450-298716,Hannibal Lector on Ice,6,4 April 2014,"A film based on a true story (Gives you extra chills if you keep this in mind) with the cooperation of a number of famous names as cast.Nicolas Cage as the dutiful State Trooper Jack Halcombe (a fictional character based on detective Glenn Flothe in reality), who's been assigned his last mission before he retires. Yet another detective who gets his last ""case"" and in no time realizes that this is going to be a hard nut to crack. Same as Robert Duvall in ""Falling Down"" or Morgan Freeman in ""Se7en "". Cage guarantees always the same way of lethargic acting. Whether he is an alcoholic in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" or a chemical weapons specialist in ""The Rock"", his acting routine is basically the same. Personally I think he deviates in this routine in ""Matchstick Men"" in which he performs in an excellent way. Recently he played in lesser films like ""Stolen"" and ""Ghost Rider"". But he always gets from me the benefit of the doubt .Cusack fits perfectly in here. He's also someone who always plays his roles in the same manner. A non-emotional face in both ""2012"" and in ""The Raven."" To be honest he didn't really evolve much since he played in the trashy teen-movie ""Serendipity"". The two main characters already met before in the movie ""Con Air"". I really need to have a look at that one somewhere in the future. The advantage Cusack has in this movie is that that non-emotional attitude suits perfectly with the person Robert Hansen, a crazy psychotic stuttering serial killer from Alaska.For me Vanessa Hudgens was the big surprise in this film. Given that the majority of films in which she appeared include the terms ""teen"" and ""high school"", she plays nevertheless in a convincing way a tormented prostitute, who experienced a youth full of abuse and then ended up in the raunchy world of prostitution full of violence, sex and domination. She can escape out of the hands of Hansen after being tortured, raped and humiliated. That's also the start of the movie.Due to the fact that it's based on a true story, there is little room for self-interpretation and the freedom to differ. Although I think the part where Hansen hires a guy to eliminate Cindy and this attempt almost is a success but Cindy can get away assisted by her former pimp (I think) played by 50Cent (with a wig that will scare the living sh*t out of you but with a perfectly palatable rendition) and saved at the last moment by the State Troopers, feels like an adaption to raise the tension a bit. Also the nail-biting house search is a romanticized version compared to what really happened as you can read on Wikipedia.Eventually it's a movie from which the audience expects more than enumerating historical facts. Ultimately, the film gives a good portrait of Hansen, the doggedness of Jack Halcombe to stop the killings and Cindy as a near-victim who tries to survive in the inhuman, harsh world of prostitution and also tries to stay out of the hands of Hansen. The images of Alaska with its vast, icy and godforsaken plains (a perfect place for disposing human remains), together with the credits at the end as a tribute to all the victims and the realization that a person is really capable to commit such horrible facts , left me with an oppressive and uncomfortable feeling.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",The Frozen Ground

It suffers from lack of confidence in the director's chair and some poor acting from all besides Nicolas Cage, Cusack (""Say Anything"") isn't necessarily bad but he's given close to zero lines. Vanessa Hudgens should really just stick with her music career as she really brings this film down a notch, her acting is too forced to be ignored. It's a decent movie that outlines a horrific moment in Alaskan history, but with a poor script and direction it keeps it from being a great one.

53,AudioFileZ,Superior True Crime Thriller,9,17 November 2013,"The Frozen Ground is an excellent crime thriller realistically brought to screen by writer/director Scott Walker. Based on the atrocities of Anchorage businessman Robert Hansen, the most prolific serial killer in Alaskan history, the viewer is taken on a harrowing ride as state trooper Jack Halcombe seeks to bring murder charges before the only known living survivor either disappears or is murdered too.This is a very intense and nerve racking atmosphere in no small part due to the cruel frozen Alaskan backdrop. That ambiance swirls above and is constantly threatening in it's stark sub-zero chill. The story itself needs little Hollywood embellishment as it is a purely evil as any in mankind's sordid history of psychopathic killers. The fact Walker preserves that pure evil without the usual Hollywood treatment puts it on a level with Copote's In Cold Blood.This is, arguably, Nicolas Cage's best performance in years portraying a state trooper on the verge of changing jobs who as if by some otherworldly pull picks up this case at great personal expense to both himself and his family. Cage is a ball of stress knowing he is, due to an obstinate district attorney, the sole person who can stop the carnage. His depiction of Jack Halcombe could hardly be more humanly moving. Perhaps the thing that keeps that stress building is the top-notch performance of John Cussack as killer Robert Hansen. Cussak is able to nail the two sided family/businessman psychopath killer as a juggernaut of evil operating in full view as he not only chooses his victims, but actually relishes in stalking them down on various remote spots before, finally, murdering them. Representing the human side of the continuing carnage director Walker has cast Vanessa Hudgens as sole survivor Cindy Paulson. Hudgens is truly a revelation in the role of a victim who is helpless in her situation. She's a drug abusing prostitute at 17 and Ms. Hudgens is more than believable as she brings this poor girl's plight to life. This film is not easy to watch as it pulls few punches as it unfolds. The Frozen Ground is without doubt an excellent crime thriller with a very sad, yet satisfying ending. Highly recommended.",The Frozen Ground
54,larrys3,Decent Serial Killer Flick,7,2 October 2013,"This film, written and directed by Scott Walker, is based on actual events that took place in Anchorage, Alaska, in 1983 and also covering a number of previous years.At first I thought the movie was not covering any new ground and was rather plodding in its' pacing. However, as tension built in the final 30 minutes of the film, I thought that things really picked up and that the plot pieces fell nicely into place.Two fine actors John Cusack and Nicolas Cage are the headliners here in the type roles they can excel at. We learn early on in the movie that Cusack, as Robert C. Hansen, is a psycho serial killer, who lures young women by offering them lucrative photo shoots. He then kidnaps, tortures, rapes, and finally kills them.When a body of a woman is uncovered in the Alaskan wild, which had been dug up by a bear, Cage, as Alaskan State Trooper Sergeant Jack Halcombe, is called in to head up the investigation. He quickly discovers that there is a connection between this woman and many missing women over the past years from Anchorage. When a conscientious local Anchorage police officer sends him several case files surreptitiously, Sgt Halcombe also concludes the local police have either completely dropped the ball on a proper investigation of the disappearing women or they're covering something up.Sgt. Halcombe also finds out there is a recent survivor of a kidnapping and rape which meets the M.O. of the previous attacks. This is Cindy Paulson, ably played by Vanessa Hudgens, who's a young prostitute that has come from an abusive home and has been on the streets since she was 11 years old. She's extremely fearful and skittish though and refuses to go into protective custody.As all signs point to Hansen as the serial rapist and killer, Sgt. Halcombe must try and find enough evidence to get a reluctant District Attorney and local police force to close in on him. At the same time, he has to try and keep Cindy alive as a witness.As mentioned, after a slow start and formulaic plot elements, I thought the movie ended up as a rather engaging and absorbing flick. The actual photos of many of the victims at the end of the film added realism and gave it a more humanistic touch.",The Frozen Ground

56,bob-rutzel-1,This was okay,5,5 October 2013,"Based upon true events in Anchorage, Alaska, 1983.Alaskan State Trooper Sgt Jack Holcombe (Nicolas Cage) believes there is a serial killer at work, but lacks evidence to prove that it is Bob Hansen (John Cusack). His superiors do not believe this is the case. We see most of the story from the perspective of prostitute Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens) who was fortunate to escape from Hansen. Her scenes provided the suspense and tension that was needed.This is okay, and the acting is good all around with most scenes at night to contrast with wintry snowy scenes which made for pretty good cinematography.This is okay, but drags a lot in the middle. Being based upon true events maybe this was necessary, but I felt many scenes could have been cut down or cut completely out. This is okay, but we felt no anger (or a cringe factor) toward serial killer Bob Hansen as the director didn't make him as menacing as he could have shown. This was treated more like a cat and mouse game. We did feel some anger and sadness when the credits ran and showed pictures of the girls who were Hansen's victims and there were a lot of them.

But it is well set up and Nicolas Cage played the character very good. I liked also John Cusack to see him in this unusual profile. As said I felt only in the last thirty minutes suspense.

58,denis888,Very Intense,8,4 August 2013,"Not an easy movie to watch. Scott Walker has made a very gruesome, realistic, deeply disturbing (at times) work that shows the rotten depths of a psychopath's mind (John Cusack, a real gem of the film), and his main antagonist, a National Guard officer (Nicolas Cage, by the way, a very decent play here). Then, there is a young lady involved in wild world of pimps, drugs and alcohol, and she plays a key role here, too. The plot is very straight and often blood-chilling, and the twists of plot can really mesmerize. In fact, the movie was a bit slow sometimes, but nobody in the audience left the theater, 'cause it was real thrilling. The spellbinding Alaskan nature is a real must see here, it simply leaves speechless with its sheer vastness and beauty. Great job of cameramen, though. The story is clear from the trailers and here the whole plot untwists slowly for almost 2 hours, but this is quite good, as the movie never drags. Constant Alaskan snow adds up to the growing suspense. The film is not the masterpiece but worth watching and very strong as a message. Great ending, by all means",The Frozen Ground
59,tomsview,Cage and Cusack create heat in the cold,8,29 December 2013,""" The Frozen Ground"" is a well-made police procedural. It is basically an expanded and more polished version of those re-enactments you see on the Crime and Investigation channel, but with far bigger stars.The movie is based on a real case, which has already appeared in documentaries and some of those re-enactments mentioned above. The story starts in 1983 when a teenage prostitute, Cindy Paulson played by Vanessa Hudgens, is found in handcuffs after escaping from a serial killer. From there, the movie follows the efforts of Nicholas Cage's character, Jack Halcombe, an FBI investigator, to catch the killer whom he believes has killed other women around Anchorage, Alaska. The Killer, Robert Hansen played by John Cusack is known from the start; the film is really about the way Halcombe gathers the evidence he needs while trying to protect Cindy Paulson from the killer and also from herself.I must admit I'm a sucker for a good police procedural, whether based on fact or not. After all, police procedure is the basis of movies such as ""The French Connection"", ""Seven"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" but they were given such dramatic edge that the formula was obscured. ""The Frozen Ground"" doesn't break from the formula, it revels in it; with walls covered in snapshots of victims and perps, gurneys in the morgue, dispassionate forensic pathologists, and dedicated investigators tracking down suspects and witnesses in places that range from suburban homes to the seediest places in the city, not to mention desolate stretches of countryside and muddy riverbanks, ""The Frozen Ground"" has them all. Formulaic? Indeed, and although it has been accused of being 'by the numbers', the numbers add up to a movie that holds your attention from beginning to end.First-time director Scott Walker who wrote and directed this movie is an impressive guy. In interviews he relates how he learned to write scripts by reading only the screenplays of movies rather than being swept up in the final film where, along with the story, the viewer is influenced by the power of the cast, cinematography, editing and music. Walker had a successful career in London advertising agencies as an account manager where he seems to have lost his Kiwi accent, but gained considerable skill in pitching a concept. He also must be a strong character to have kept actors like Nicholas Cage and John Cusack heading in the direction he wanted.Both Cage and Cusack give beautifully controlled performances in this film, as does Vanessa Hudgens who is painfully convincing as Cindy Paulson, the vulnerable, 18-year-old prostitute. ""The Frozen Ground"" tells its tale in a straightforward manner, and uses its unusual location to full advantage. From the description of the case on Wikipedia, it also seems to follow the facts closely. After this debut, I hope Scott Walker continues to make movies for a long while yet.",The Frozen Ground

Though, on the whole, it's satisfactorily presented and keeps the viewer entertained and entwined. The direction by Scott Walker, who also wrote the story, is tight and well crafted. He does a great job of recreating the eras, both in sound and vision.Nicholas Cage portrays the trooper Jack Halcombe, and though we know he can really act, Adaptation, Matchstick Men, World Trade Center, and Joe, here we have the usual Nicholas Cage being Nicholas Cage (though I have to say I am a fan of his work as his films are enjoyable).John Cusack gives a subdued performance as the killer Robert Hanson. Though, this makes the character more believable; on the outside, Hanson is a quiet man with a family who goes to work to provide - an ordinary man, Though on the inside and in private moments he allows the psychopath to take the reigns. Cusack does a good job of showing the frustration, anger, and desperation caused when the police net draws in closer.The best performance is that of Vanessa Hudgens, who plays Cindy Poulson, the only survivor of Robert Hanson. She expertly shows us Poulson's vulnerability, confusion, anger, distrust, and fear of her life. There is a lot going on in this character's life as she's a runaway become prostitute. Hudgens deftly handles the complexities and develops a believable character, giving the viewers someone to relate to.Brad William Henke does an outstanding portrait of a criminal thug, come, henchman, Carl Galenski. His formidable size is foreboding. You would not want to go up against this man.The rest of the cast also do a great job of keeping the feel of this movie, though I do think that Radha Mitchell, who plays Jack Halcombe's wife Allie, is much underused. She's a talented actress, but here she only has a few scenes.The story is a strong one and needed to be told. The story does not glorify anything at all and in this case, it works well. Everything is nitty gritty truth and reality. No character shines above any of the others; this is not a Nicholas Cage film; it's not a John Cusack film.I really enjoyed this movie and would watch it again. If you like true tales of crime and justice this is for you.",The Frozen Ground
67,brchthethird,A great watch in spite of the lack of originality,7,14 November 2014,"Despite being rather formulaic and predictable (as true crime can be), the film is bolstered by strong performances, beautiful photography and assured direction by first-time director Scott Walker. The story is is about an investigation into a series of unsolved disappearances when one of the victims manages to escape. Nicolas Cage plays the sergeant in charge of the investigation and John Cusack plays the serial killer. Both give solid performances, and the cat-and-mouse game that ensues will keep you on the edge of your seat. Vanessa Hudgens does an OK job as the victim who escapes, a prostitute/stripper who is down on her luck and always trying to run from her problems. She did manage to be convincing most of the time, although she does have work to do if she's going to be taken seriously as an actress. Also, since this movie was produced in 2011, this might have had something to do with her casting in Harmony Korine's SPRING BREAKERS. Returning back to the story, there really are no surprises narrative-wise due to this being a crime procedural, but the material is elevated by the quality of the filmmaking. One thing I didn't expect to see was Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson appear in a minor role as the pimp of Vanessa Hudgens' character Cindy. I've never really been a big fan of him as an actor, but fortunately his role wasn't too major. There were also a couple other small roles that weren't acted too well, but they didn't have too much of a negative effect on the overall picture. Anyway, I can highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys these type of movies. The lurid material is dealt with sensitively, even if it isn't too deep, and above all the strong central performances make this a riveting watch from beginning to end.",The Frozen Ground
68,classicalsteve,Throughly Engaging Suspense/Serial Killer Thriller with Cusak in an Outstanding Performance,8,16 June 2014,"""The Frozen Ground"" is loosely based on the Robert Hansen abductions and murders in Anchorage, Alaska. In the 1970's and early 1980's, young women in their late teens and twenties were mysteriously disappearing in the urban area of Anchorage, Alaska. Since many people go missing in the United States, law enforcement thought these were simply unsolved and unrelated cases. However, when Cindy Paulson, a local prostitute, was found handcuffed and bloody in a motel in Anchorage, local authorities wanted to hear more about this case. She claimed she had been abducted by a strange man who had promised money for oral sex. He had handcuffed her and sexually molested, raped and tortured her. Luckily she escaped when he tried to force her into a monoplane, and she made it to a motel back in Anchorage. However, local authorities don't believe her because she's a prostitute and she continually lies about her age. The man she accuses of these crimes against her is a relatively upstanding citizen.Detective Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage) reluctantly takes the case and speculates whether some of these disappearances could be related to Paulson's case. Is it possible this man could be responsible for the disappearances of the many young women for the last ten years? A few other bodies are then discovered around the mostly frozen areas outside the Anchorage urban center. Halcombe broadens his investigation inquiring into the seedier areas of Anchorage, mostly where strippers, erotic dancers and prostitutes apply their trades. At the same time, Halcombe wants Paulson to testify against her abductor if he's caught, but Paulson is reluctant to get involved.Robert (""Bob"") Hansen (John Cusak in an exemplary performance) seems like a quiet upstanding citizen of Anchorage who likes to engage in animal hunting. In the film he runs some kind of restaurant or bakery where he manages the baking of bread and cakes. He is also an excellent marksman, and he displays the heads of many animals as trophies in his house. The real Hansen apparently set several local hunting records. However, we see Hansen's ""other side"" as he abducts another woman, Debbie Peters, and has her chained to a pole on the floor in his house. A friendly neighbor stops by to offer Hansen leftovers, and he politely declines. He had threatened Peters not to scream when his neighbor dropped in.Meanwhile, a kind of subplot is the story of Cindy Paulson and how she begins working as an erotic/exotic dancer at a strip club. Eventually, the two other stories collide with the third: the investigation of the missing women, the further abductions by Hansen, and Paulson's life as an erotic dancer. We also learn that Paulson had an African-American pimp who is upset about her exotic dancing.Overall, a very compelling and well-written film. The stand-out has to be Cusak who plays a kind of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. When he's Hansen, the well-meaning recluse and amateur hunter, he seems like a reasonable person. However, as Hansen the abductor, we learn that his hunting hobby has a much more sinister side. One of the better films of its type and dedicated to the many women who were Hansen's victims in real life. The film actually uses pictures from the real photos of the many women whose lives were cut short by Hansen.",The Frozen Ground
69,SanteeFats,Pretty good,8,23 February 2014,"Man I knew Nicolas Cage and John Cusack were really good actors but I was very impressed with Vanessa Hudgens's acting in this movie. Nicolas plays an Alaskan State Trooper detective sergeant who is leaving his job in two weeks to move to the lower 48 to help out his family. He gets involved in what turns out to be a serial killer case. John Cusack is the killer and plays a real creepy guy very well. He has buried many young women's corpses all over Alaska over many years. He screws up when his latest victim gets away (Hudgens). Hudgens is a street hooker he had picked up and brought to his ""den"". Here she is chained to a post, raped (with a condom no less) (smart creep). Her escape provides the eventual conclusive moment at the end of the film. Seeing her Cusack incriminates himself with several comments that leave his case an open and shut one now. There are several character actors that play some of the cops and they do an impressive job in their own right. The fact that this movie is based on an actual case and the results that come about makes it even more enthralling too me.",The Frozen Ground

74,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,6,14 November 2014,"2013 American Thriller based on the real-life 1980s Alaskan hunt for serial killer Robert Hansen (played hauntingly terrific by Cusack). Alaska State Trooper Cage (based on retired Alaska State Police Detective Glenn Flothe) partners with sole-survivor Hudgens to take down the serial killer. Curtis James Jackson III (going by his rap-name 50 Center again) is a nice little touch at first, but quickly becomes just a cheap plot-device. The film suffers from typical thriller nonsense; Cage is just blah, Hudgens might be a little in-over-her-head, and director Scott Walker definitely lets the viewer know this is his debut film what with the unnecessary aggressive cinematography of a COPS segment at the beginning that slowly transitions into an effortless Lifetime Movie by the end. The ambitious 26 day shooting schedule (on location in the intended autumn season, no less) can't save the film from its flaws. Walker does an excellent job letting the detective, the killer and the victim all share the plot, but the quality of the story comes first, dude. You'll get some brownie points for seeing a chilling psycho in Cusack, but you wasted such talents as Dean Norris. Fun and satisfying if you're in the mood for thriller, but not a must-see and has little (if any) replay value.**½ (out of four)",The Frozen Ground

Nicolas Cage, true story, Alaska and the guy from ""Breaking Bad"".What was it about? The pursuit of real-life serial killer Robert Hansen.Any good? This was certainly no ""Zodiac"" but nowhere near a Lifetime movie either. It was better than I thought. Nicolas Cage and John Cusack have still got it, despite their careers descending into B-grade schlock. Vanessa Hudgens and Dean Norris put in strong, convincing performances too which helped what was at times a meandering story.The cold Alaskan setting helped provide a lot of the dark atmosphere. Would this have been a lot better-off in the hands of a David Fincher? Absolutely. But ""The Frozen Ground"" did what it said on the packet. It's ultimately a by-the-numbers true crime drama that most will forget - but it kept me engaged. The true life story added an extra layer of interest.Highlight?

76,dfa120374,Bit Of A Yawnathon,4,15 January 2015,"Alaskan State trooper Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage) is on the hunt for serial killer Robert Hansen (John Cusack). After being given a case file on Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens), the latest victim who actually manages to escape before being killed, Halcombe seeks help from her, but having trust issues and being a drug addict she's reluctant to help. Halcombe needs to persuade Cindy to help them in putting Hansen away before he kills again.Frozen Ground is really just your average run-of-the-mill mystery crime thriller adaptation that is based on the true events of serial killer Robert Hansen, who killed between 17 and 21 women. John Cusack does a good job of bringing a cold-blooded performance to portray Robert Hansen, and Nicolas Cage is decent as a non-intense State trooper Jack Halcombe.In all honesty, Cage and Cusack are about the best this film gets as it is a very slow going movie and it really does just drag on. It does start off OK and at a decent pace, but unfortunately it just never picks up at all and actually dies down quite a lot. A movie doesn't have to be non-stop action for me to enjoy and there have been slower-paced films I've liked, but for me after about 45 minutes Frozen Ground just gets boring.I kind of struggled to give the movie the rating I did, but it was bumped up mainly because of Cusack and Cage's performances.

79,HEFILM,You've seen it all done better before.,5,28 October 2014,"Cage and Cusack are fine but given little to do. The director shows no real flair for suspense and a lack of imagination. It seems that every five minutes we have a gloomy flyover shot of snowy mountains. There is no depth to any of the based on real life characters, no sustained suspense of horror scenes. The primary set piece we see is split up over the course of the film as flashbacks to which we know the outcome. The surface approach the writer director takes could only work if the film was intense and exploitative and it is neither. There is a sad grimness to the portions devoted to hookers lives in Alaska but this is just off putting. Cage is far better than the material which includes the clichéd personal tragic incident in his past and his shrewish wife. Cusack, as the killer, we are given no insight into why he does what he does and the bits of his life we are shown seem pointless. There is no counterpoint between his public life and the horrid hidden life. The interrogation scenes with Cage and Cusack build some intensity, but by then the film is almost over.

It is not very original except possibly for the Alaska setting. It is very choppy in its implementation. It also seemed to want to focus more on the seedy parts of the Alaskan nightlife than the actual murderer and his pursuit. We did not even get any nice scenery, just read, flashy and seedy nightclubs or a gray and dull outside.I never really got very interested in whether the guy got caught or not and even Nicholas Cage failed to catch my interest.

83,doug_park2001,Good Docu-Drama,7,7 October 2013,"THE FROZEN GROUND does a straightforwardly fine job of relating the story of 1980s Alaska serial killer Robert Hansen. It's easily the best based-upon-fact murder film to come along in some time. The keen use of settings brings about crucial realism. Cusack and Cage both give impressive performances as, respectively, Hansen himself and Alaska State Detective Jack Halcombe, a rather uncoppish cop (typical role for Cage). Vanessa Hudgens is spectacular as would-be victim Cindy Paulson; many of the other supporting cast also give excellent performances, particularly Curtis ""50-Cent"" Jackson as Paulson's sometime-pimp. THE FROZEN GROUND relates the police investigation with all its little holes, inconsistencies, and disagreements most convincingly. The film also gives a realistic--I assume, never having personally been there, of course--portrayal of the Anchorage underworld and red light district. Some gore and partial nudity: THE FROZEN GROUND is tasteful as possible without pulling any punches. Last but far from least, some of the small, apparently insignificant details--e.g., the moose in the alleyway--add oh-so-much in the way of subtle mood and symbolism.POTENTIAL SPOILERS FOLLOW: This may have been hard to avoid, but it might have worked better if the killer's identity was not made clear so early in the film and if more of the other suspects had been brought into the picture. That way, there would have been some element of surprise for those not already familiar with this case, which isn't all that well-known. A bit more on Hansen's sickly unique M.O. might also have helped distinguish THE FROZEN GROUND. Finally, I wanted to see how exactly Paulson managed to escape Hansen, as well as why he managed to avoid arrest immediately after she did.",The Frozen Ground

The story does its best to keep you guessing, and they leveraged the stupidity of the young girl to ratchet up suspense as best as possible. This is worth a view.Not sure if the town was filmed in the real Anchorage, but the airplane scenes and snowy mountain vistas were impressive, if but to convey that out here, if you're in trouble, ain't no one gonna find out, which unfortunately resonated throughout the film.Makes me think thrice about wanting to visit Anchorage though.",The Frozen Ground
85,darkreignn,"A surprisingly well-made, if basic, detective drama",7,17 February 2021,"From the start, you can tell that ""The Frozen Ground"" has some competency behind it. The slow, eerie shots of the snowy Alaskan climate during the opening credits immediately instill a sense of foreboding, and set a good precedent for the atmosphere of the film as a whole. The loud, booming score adds to the atmosphere, creating a pervading sense of dread that lingers from scene to scene. And the acting from the main cast is excellent, with Vanessa Hudgens especially giving a standout, show stealing performance. ""The Frozen Ground"" has been crafted with care, and an obvious passion in regards to the story being told - which is fantastic, as it adds a layer of watchability onto what would otherwise be a mediocre film.Director and writer Scott Walker obviously has an affinity for the subject matter, and deeply cares about getting this story out into the mainstream. And what is the story? ""The Frozen Ground"" tells the real-life tale of killer Robert Hansen, played by John Cusack in the film, and specifically the story of how he was brought to justice. Robert Hansen was especially prolific, murdering upwards of 17 girls throughout his life; the film covers his career as a serial killer right as the walls are closing in on him because of the fact that one of his victims, Cindy Paulson, played by Vanessa Hudgens, escaped his clutches. ""The Frozen Ground"" follows Cindy as she partners with Alaska State Trooper Jack Halcombe, portrayed by Nicolas Cage, to try to catch Robert before he can kill again. It's a true, tragic story - but does it work well on film? In my opinion, yes.Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, and Vanessa Hudgens give fantastic performances, with Vanessa being the fiery, emotional character, while Nic and John take a more quiet and reserved approach for the most part. All of them elevate this material above what it would've been if in the hands of less capable actors, making even the most cliched lines effective and believable. The movie moves along as you'd expect, never throwing in too many surprises or curveballs. However, the acting from the main trio is so good, that you can't help but be glued to the screen. Vanessa especially gives a vulnerable performance that I could have seen getting some award recognition, if the movie was more widely known.The movie takes on a handheld directing style, which I found very effective for the material. It wasn't overly shaky like something Paul Greengrass would create; instead, it's just shaky enough to add a sense of realism, pseudo-documentarism, and intensity to each scene. Also, the movie moves at a very brisk pace, making it impossible to be bored. I can honestly say that I was constantly entertained while watching this movie, never pausing to check my phone or get up from the couch once. That said, the quick pacing does make the beginning of the movie feel slightly rushed, but I imagine that was to throw the viewers into the chaos that the police suddenly found themselves in.There were some things about this movie that I didn't like - tonally, there were points of inconsistency. For example, for a movie that takes such a serious approach to the topic at hand, I didn't appreciate a scene where we saw a woman pole-dance, the camera lingering on her body. While it made sense thematically, I found it exploitative and inappropriate. Additionally, 50 Cent was in this movie wearing a hairstyle so ridiculous that every time he was on screen the movie felt like it was turning into a parody. Also, as I mentioned earlier, there was some cliched dialogue in here that probably could've been script doctored to a more believable degree. That said, the actors deliver their lines with intensity and professionalism, and so the cheesy dialogue didn't bother me too much.""The Frozen Ground"" is a surprisingly good true crime film, with Cusack, Cage, and Hudgens giving amazing performances - when Cage and Cusack are in the same scene, they demolish the screen, and the film is worth watching just to see them together.

Even despite he often does ""lazy acting"" similar to Bruce Willis and even though he has a major spending problem. The money situation is personal and he still has way more money than most of us and the lazy acting thing still doesn't subtract from his wide arrangement of great roles he has played. I watched ""The Frozen Ground"" back when it was released but to be honest the first 30 minutes of the film became too muddled and confusing for me to be able to effectively follow the rest of it. For some reason the first 25 minutes or so seem to be under cooked. Why was the girl, Cindy, cuffed in that random bathroom to begin with? I guess maybe because some other nasty guy from the streets did this to her after she escaped Hansen? Idk, and even after watching it again last night and thoroughly enjoying it, I still don't really know. Also, in the beginning, there is fast paced police work with out much background at all. We meet a few characters we wont see later in the film and it is sort of hard to match the victims with who Sgt. Jack Halcombe is talking about in the moment. However, I realized quite a bit more on the second viewing and the movie actually comes together quite nicely. Nicholas Cage gives a subtle yet great performance as does John Cusack. I do not like Vanessa Hudgens but she honestly was good in her role as Cindy. She was riding her lightning from 2012's gritty and raw ""Spring Breakers"".

The approach was different enough that I found myself pulled into it, wanting to see this creep nailed and jailed.The young woman who played a victim of the serial molester did an amazing job of making you feel her frustration and fear. I was impressed with her performance. The scenes where she was ducking in and out of the seedy places in Anchorage were disturbing. It bothers me greatly to think there might be such a huge amount of traffic in drugs and prostitution. Too often a high percentage of the women are being used and abused. And often they are underage girls lead into that by people who use them as cash cows and do little for their welfare.The story moves along well, there is music perfect for the scenes that help you feel the tension at times and yet foreboding when the camera pans the wild Alaskan wilderness. Beautiful but a bit intimidating with its harshness.The movie does an excellent job of slowly building the tension as it nears the end. For a few agonizing minutes you do not know what will happen to the young frightened girl. Will the bad guys do her in? Will the cops find her in time? I won't tell you and ruin it for you.I recommend this movie for any above age 17. There is considerable nudity at the dance ""studios"" that might be a bit much for the younger teens.

96,nebk,A Chilling Thriller,7,27 August 2013,"The Frozen Ground is an intense yet subtle thriller that definitely deserves to be watched. As it based on a true story it does not have high speed car chases or gun-fights galore that one would expect in a move starring Nicolas Cage. It is a portrayal of a detective in the early 1980's on the trail of a serial killer who has until then managed to stay hidden and unnoticed. Nicolas Cage is the detective who comes into contact with a girl (Vanessa Hudgens) who managed to escape her abductor, played creepily and effectively by John Cusack. Even though she reported her kidnapping and rape to the police they felt disinclined to believe her as she was a prostitute and her abductor was seen as an upstanding citizen of the community who had an alibi (even though he had prior arrests for sexual assault). Through the movie the police find more and more evidence suggesting that quite a few women have disappeared and realize that they have a serial killer on their hands.From there on they start zeroing in on the serial killer but cannot do anything until they gather enough evidence against him. And a cat-and-mouse game ensues where they are on the trail of the killer who is simultaneously trying to eliminate the only witness who can testify against him. Even though this is not a blockbuster there are some genuinely effective scenes in the movie, like when the killer takes one of his victims into the Alaskan wilderness and executes her in the forest. Having been based on a true story the movie ends with the photos of all of the known victims who were killed. And that makes the movie much more realistic when you remember that what you have watched is not a fictional story but has actually happened. Overall the acting is very good. Nicolas Cage gives a subtle performance as opposed to his usual manic acting style. John Cusack's portrayal of the killer is superb and Vanessa Hudgens also acts well in her role. The supporting actors all do their part well (yes even 50 Cent) to make The Frozen Ground an interesting and watchable thriller.Overall I would rate this movie as a 7/10. If you liked a movie like Citizen X then you might enjoy watching this, if you expect Nicholas Cage and John Cusack to have a similar interaction like they did in Con Air you might be disappointed.",The Frozen Ground
97,bushtony,Solid,7,24 August 2013,"I recently watched NAKED FEAR (2007), a cheap exploitation flick and largely fictionalised work based loosely on the events depicted in THE FROZEN GROUND. It piqued my interest and so I sought out this more factual version of events.Performance wise, Cage is nicely understated and thankfully restrained as the obsessive cop of the trail of serial killer Robert Hansen. Cusack dons a pair of glasses as the stone-faced rapist/murderer and manages to convey a nice sense of barely concealed creepiness, insanity and perverted sleaze bubbling away beneath a veneer of amiable civility and upstanding citizenship. Impressive also is Vanessa Hudgens as the young prostitute who escapes Hansen's clutches only to find herself marginalised by the police and her life very much at risk.Camera-work and location shots are especially impressive, depicting a barren Alaskan wilderness with a desolate and chilly visual flair. This adds much atmosphere to the proceedings.Overall it's a fairly gripping police procedural concerning the obtaining of enough physical evidence to secure prosecution and conviction of a man who has tortured, raped and executed over thirty women using a relatively consistent modus operandi.There is a considered approach throughout with only a few gruesome shots of the corpses of the victims and no real splatter or gore on show. The story is treated respectfully and any urge to sensationalise is held very much in check. It's an easy option to go all out for graphic visual shocks with such subject matter, but writer/director Scott Walker has steered away from that direction, instead relying on verbal descriptions by the characters and suggesting the nature of the disturbing horror of Hansen's appalling handiwork through their reactions.However, although there are some good moments of suspense (most in relation to Hudgen's stupidly risky behaviour and Hansen's attempts to silence her) actual thrills are few and far between. Thus, THE FROZEN GROUND ends up being solid rather than spectacular and at times feels almost a little flat, matter-of-fact and uninspired.That said, it's a generally well-crafted and involving piece that is well worth a look.",The Frozen Ground
98,andymaranam,Based on a true story..,7,11 June 2019,"But misses on the delivery. Not for lack of talent in Cage & cusack,.who play their parts to a teet, but for lack of originality considering the person this story is based on is very original in retrospect, it could have focused more on the magnitude of his crimes rather than one specific person(who survived!! Yes..) So completey understand the premise yet I still feel 20mins of a more in depth look at the monster this person is would not have gone a miss. That being said it's a good film not quite the house that Jack built for a more in depth look at the barbarity it's still a good watch if not just for cusack and Cages performance.",The Frozen Ground
99,The_Dead_See,Fairly accurate (and hence sometimes dull) true-life serial killer story,6,14 October 2014,"The Frozen Ground exists somewhere between an accurate crime procedural documentary and a thrilling Hollywood serial killer flick. It's not quite accurate enough to be taken as a straight retelling of Robert Hansens' diabolical killing spree in 1970s/80s Anchorage; but it's also not quite exciting enough to satisfy viewers who are looking for a faster paced thrill ride. It's quite a brave line to tread really, and although the end-result is a little slow and occasionally dull, it's still intriguing and tense enough to be worth the time. It put me in mind of other slow-burn thrillers such as One Hour Photo and Insomnia. If you liked those, you'll probably like this.Cage is surprisingly subdued in his role, and it's really nice to see that he can still play a character with softer edges. Cusack is exceptional as Hansen - channeling a subtle menace masked beneath a small-town nice-guy persona. This is far from the Hannibal Lecter or Ted Bundy style psychopath that mainstream thrillers typically portray. Cusack's psychopath is fragile, introverted, human and deeply damaged and although I've never met a psychopath in real life (to the best of my knowledge) this portrayal seems more like what I would expect a real killer to be like.Rounding out the triad is Vanessa Hudgens as a troubled 18 year old prostitute. Again, this portrayal is very realistic. There's a subtle troubled humanity there and nary a heart of gold in sight.Because of its concessions to the real events (Hansen was captured and imprisoned, not taken out in a heroic, time-sensitive chase/rescue scene), The Frozen Ground can seem dull and uninspired at times, but if you haven't yet heard the story of Hansen's crimes it's quite an engaging introduction to them.",The Frozen Ground
100,DanLives1980,A suspenseful serial killer drama with contrast,7,23 August 2014,"For a long time I've missed Nicolas Cage's dramatic edge. 'The Frozen Ground' brings that back in a way you haven't seen. With the fine abilities of John Cusack in an opposing role, and other great go-to actors of similar genres, this is a lower-end serial killer movie to rival the likes of 'Se7en,' 'Summer of Sam' and 'Zodiac.' When a young prostitute is left alive by suspected serial killer Robert Hansen (Cusack), Alaskan State Trooper Jack Halcombe buries himself in the case, all too aware that if he fails, young women will continue to die and he will never get to lock Hansen away.'The Frozen Ground' is like a cross between Christopher Nolan's 'Insomnia' and 'Zodiac', being based on a true story back in the '70s and having a great amount of realism pumped into the film's dark and seedy aesthetic. Being a fan of older New York crime movies from the likes of Abel Ferrara, I really appreciated the film's stark contrasts to the aspiring tourist's image of Alaska. It's freezing cold, dirty, dark and dangerous, and it's not as far out in the sticks as you might imagine.What really works for me is already knowing from the start that Hansen is guilty. It's a frustrating race against time to catch a monster posing as a family man. Halcombe knows this and as troubled as he is, being a family man himself, he cannot let go, but neither does Cage eat up the screen with his usual wackiness.Vanessa Hudgens is decent as troubled young woman Cindy Paulson and does a good job for most of the duration, but what really surprised me was 50-Cent's turn as a pimp. It was nothing new, but still, he was pretty effective.Lastly, I thought that Cusack might not be able to drop the straightforward nice guy face for the serial killer role, but he does a fantastic job on Hansen. I don't know about that guy, but I most definitely saw traces of Ed Gein and others. Cusack put a lot of effort in as Cage added a sombre weightiness. This movie's strength really is its contrast!",The Frozen Ground
101,mandagrammy,Well-Made True Story Drama,8,8 September 2020,"This is a very good drama based on a true story, with an excellent atmosphere that makes it even more chilling. The actors are on point, doing a great job of showing the more frustrating side of justice, when they know who is guilty of a horrible crime, but don't have enough to bring charges. I really appreciated them giving a face to the victims who are often ignored or disrespected by most of society. They at least deserve that when their story is being told.",The Frozen Ground
102,horizon2008,Left me cold,4,22 September 2013,"Based on a true story, (you get filled in at the end of the movie with updates to the case), Frozen Ground is a crime thriller set in a bleak landscape of murder and mystery. Sadly however, it's a thriller with no thrills, bringing almost no tension or build up to anything that goes on. I'm not sure what's happened to Nicolas Cage over this last many years, but everything he's in these days turns out to be a damp squib. That strained look of desperation he always has while acting is probably the same look most of us have watching him acting. I get the impression he just acts enough now to get a few dollars to pay his bills. Then there's John Cusack..I love John Cusack, I always have. He's never really made the A List but he's stayed just bubbling below the surface since the lost days of the 1980s. Man I loved so many of the flicks he was in back then, so as usual, when I saw he was in Frozen Ground I thought it should be OK. And with him playing a baddie role too! Sounded great.Unfortunately though, Cusack tries to play the weird and creepy serial killer here and it just doesn't work. Maybe it's me, but he just didn't carry the part well at all as he looked very mis-cast. The scenes of him after his arrest at the police station are some of the worst, and it's around this time you're kinda thinking hmm, is this flick nearly over? It's a sad thing that this movie is trying to tell the story of an awful event/events but it comes across as totally unshocking for most of it's running. And the tagged on words on the screen at the end seem as if they belong to another film which was much much better, not this frozen dud.",The Frozen Ground

With out bothering to read up on it, I figured it was action movie.Then to my surprise when the movie started. I knew what it was about since I've seen profiles of the particular horrific murder the movie was based on.All the acting performances were great: Nicolas Cage, Vanessa Hudgens, and Dean Norris (we all known from the ""Under the Dome"" TV series) were outstanding.They brought their 'A' game here.Now unexpected was John Cusack. Personally I wasn't the biggest fan. While pretty enjoyable in movies like ""1408"", ""Max"", etc., I generally found his acting to be shallow and insincere. But here he totally nailed it! Probably a role difficult for most actors to carry. Very believable, fitting, intense, even ""bone chilling"" at times.Great quality and pace through out the movie kept us glued to it. Well done!",The Frozen Ground
105,The_moan_of_all_moans,Cage; the classics just keep coming.....,4,30 July 2013,"When you see the name Nicolas Cage advertised for a new film, the chances are that it isn't going to be very good. I have liked films he has been a lead role in (con-Air) and have loved some he's been part of (Kick-Ass), but this falls into my pessimistic opening line.As it is based on a true story (and due to the topic portrayed) there is an immediate intrigue that is installed in your mind. So i watched with interest and although i had my doubts about Cage, i was confident that John Cusack would stand out. His short, but fascinating role in ""The Paperboy"" was more than enough to convince me he can play a deranged character.Due to the nature of the film and it's gruesome inspiration it's hard to justify saying this, but i wanted to see more of John Cusack as Robert Hansen. But as the film is based around the knowledge of Cindy Paulson (played well by Vanessa Hudgens) i can only imagine that they had no in depth details on why Robert Hansen committed such horrible crimes and only had the story through the eyes of Cindy and Jack Halcombe (Cage).It is an OK film, in no way a classic. I can only recommend not going to the cinema as it would be a sense of wasted money that may arise in your mind (i had an unlimited card so i was fine). Maybe just wait a few years until it arrives free on TV.",The Frozen Ground

I once saw a documentary on the real killer this film was based on ('The Butcher Baker' Robert Hansen.), and even that created more tension than this movie did. This is very watchable, but there's nothing special here at all. The only other film about Robert Hansen is a very loosely based version that is honestly quite terrible called 'Naked Fear'. The title might entice some, but trust me, it's garbage not worth anyone's time. At least we have some good actors here and the story is certainly competent. This is definitely worth watching if you have some interest in it. 7/10.",The Frozen Ground

The writer obviously did absolutely no research and did not consult with a law enforcement professional before writing this script The language, procedure, etc depicted in the opening scenes as well as all of the related subsequent ones were just hilarious. I counted twenty significant issues within the first 10 minutes. I cannot fathom why writers or producers make films depicting content that they know only from watching other films.

108,movieliker1,Not good.,3,4 September 2020,"The problem with this movie is it's a murder mystery trying to be an action thriller. It's not.One of the main characters is Cindy (played by Vanessa Hudgens). She's portrayed as a very unappealing person. She's a drug addicted, alcoholic, chain smoking prostitute who's half the time too cool for police to deal with. And the other half, she's an hysterical looney toon who's making one mistake after the other. When people try to help her she's rude, offensive, insulting and disrespectful. When police put her in a safe house, she inexplicably keeps leaving to return to the strip where she bounces back and fourth between dancing at a strip club, and working the streets for her pimp (played by 50 Cent), inspite of claiming people there are trying to kill her. I found her so annoying, I really didn't care if she lived or died.The police are portrayed old school with the sergeant who screams and threatens to fire everybody. Both the police and the DA seem more interested in protecting the serial killer than helping the victims.Of course now we have the old cliche played by Nicholas Cage of the only detective interested in doing the right thing ""because he's dedicated to his job"" even though his family life is suffering and he's supposed to retire in two weeks. Not only does he have to fight with Cindy who shows no interest in helping. He also is fighting the police sergeant and the DA who don't want to reopen the case.The music is over the top. It starts out immediately like something you would expect at the climax of an action thriller, and stays there throughout the whole movie. It's exhausting.It supposedly based on a true story. The only good part is at the end when they put up in text the facts of the real case.""Cindy"" is portrayed as a hero, even though she does nothing but luckily survive an attempted murder by a serial killer, which happens before the movie even starts. The rest of the time she's just an uncooperative pain in the butt. In the movie she doesn't even testify against the villain. She just unrealistically pops in the door of an interrogation causing the serial killer to blurt out, ""I should have killed you when I had the chance !!!""Not good.

It makes audience (who doesn't know the tragedy) curious of what happens next although from the start we already know who's the killer. Scott Parker as director has succeeded to pack this low-budget movie into something's still enjoyable to watch. Also some familiar actors seems helpful to lift this movie. Cage and Cusack act convincingly as a cop and a calm mental disorder killer. Unfortunately, 'Frozen Ground' feels repeatable from other serial killer movie that could bored fans of this kind of genre. Overall, 'Frozen Ground' is a satisfying movie and above average of crime thriller. The recognizable cast somehow increases tense in this movie.

113,jaywensley2004,Movie elevated by its earnestness.,6,17 April 2014,"I normally limit my reviews to movies in which the story, characters, acting, etc. evoke strong feelings in me. I'm making an exception for ""Frozen Ground""; a well-made movie to be sure, but for all its excellent craftwork, a mediocre film. I want to review ""Frozen Ground"" because, having watched it (on DVD along with all the disc's extras) I believe the film deserves viewing; I was moved by the sense of purpose I felt throughout my viewings. This movie's creators and performers have made a movie which gave me a sense that they believe this (based on) true story can serve a purpose beyond being entertainment.I want to be clear from the start that I have no idea how accurately this film depicts the truth, the reality, of the events depicted. I began watching with my usual skepticism and cynicism about movies ""based on true events."" By the movie's end I had decided that it didn't matter because, even if THIS movie took liberties, the events, situations, dialogues and behaviors depicted have occurred, and they have likely occurred often enough for me to be interested and concerned about their occurrence. So...Early in, ""Frozen Ground"" presents the film-makers version of the conduction/investigation of a rape allegation by a known prostitute in Anchorage, Alaska. The depiction of the police officers involved, their beliefs, attitudes and techniques, presents a legitimate representation of the difficulties and attitudes that unavoidably affect and influence police investigations. The victim (and we know she IS a victim) is sincerely both believed and doubted by the police officers involved. This leads to what I find to be the film's first, worst and most frequently recurring fault: The Direction/Editing is too quick and fractured to allow the viewer to evaluate the events presented as facts:""Frozen Ground"" alternates between a cinema-verite, documentary style and a more traditional story-telling approach. I found myself frequently confounded by this too-often sudden switch. During my second viewing I frequently hit the ""Rewind"" Button for the purpose of being clear on what had been said, what had been depicted; what were ""The Facts"" as the film-makers wanted me to know them?Still, despite the faults I found, I found this sequence sufficiently involving to garner respect for the acting and film-making to want to stay with the movie.This led to my second big problem with ""Frozen Ground."" I think the story being told is bigger, too complicated, for the movie in its ""Running time."" As I continued to watch I kept getting lost. Think of the ""gutters"" in a comic or graphic novel. As Scott McLoud ""illustrated"" (pun intended) in ""Understanding Comics"", stuff happens in between the panels, or in the case of movies, in between scenes (or frames). The viewer/reader must be led to and relied upon to infer the writer's intent. ""Frozen Ground"" fails to lead me to ""connect the dots"" I need to connect.There are films that ask to be re-watched: ""Momento"", ""Mulholland Drive"", and ""Sucker Punch"" are examples of such movies: Deliberately crafted to require second, third and more viewings in order to reveal the ""secrets"" and meanings of the story. But ""Frozen Ground"" is not among this category of movies.I think ""Frozen Ground"" is the story of an investigation that was so subtle, so complicated, that it defies the typical attention span of a typical audience for a typical, non-action flick. I think the studio, producers and film-makers recognized this and attempted to replace the ""leg-work and brain-work"" that resolved these crimes with depictions of emotional commitment and determination by the police investigators involved.""Frozen Ground"" is at its best during the sequences depicting conversations/interrogations between Nicholas Cage and John Cusack. No surprise there; these are two of our finest actors working together. But even so, these scenes are never better than a good episode of ""Law & Order"".But at its finish ""Frozen Ground"" exhibits and seeks empathy for its ""raison d'etre:"" To respect, honor and value the lives of the women who were and/or may be victims of Robert Hanson and/or humans (yep! men AND women) like him.And more than this, I think ""Frozen Ground"" asks us...US!...you and me, to recognize and RESPECT that sex and any activity related to sex, not be discarded....DISREGARDED, because of its connection to sex.In the film the Hanson character (depicted by Cusack) states that he would not ask his wife (a person he ""respects"") to perform oral sex. He even asks Cage's character (a policeman) to appreciate and respect this evaluation.At ""Frozen Ground""'s end there is a Credit Sequence which identifies numerous women who were or may have been victims of Robert Hanson. This sequence is the motivation for my reviewing and encouraging viewing ""Frozen Ground"" at least once. This sequence asks us to become involved in lives remote from ours. It's a ""one-trick pony,"" but it is appropriate and well-used in ""Frozen Ground"".",The Frozen Ground
114,rosecalifornia,Not worth the time,2,25 July 2016,"This movie is not worth the time. I really wanted to enjoy it, I used to be a fan of Nicholas Cage and I was actually excited to give it a shot. But within 10 to 15 minutes the story line fell flat.The worst part of this entire movie is the person(s) involved that decided to use a shaky-cam. This cinematography for this film is not just laughable, it is nauseating and dizzying. It actually seems like there is a monkey jumping around on top of the camera(s) while it was being filmed. And at high points of tension in the film, the shaking even gets worse, it really is un-watchable simply because of that.If you are able to look past the vibrating camera-work and actually watch this film it just doesn't grab you. From what I understand this is based on a true story. Yet it just doesn't do justice to the victims or the officers that worked the case. The one redeeming person in the film, is actually Cusack.

Cage sleepwalks through his role. Hudgens, trying to break out from her Disneyficaction, is nothing special playing a teen hooker/stripper. Cusack does pretty well as the good citizen killer, but we never really understand his motivations.The multiple times someone gets located simply by driving down a street and seeing them detracted from the believability. The cops seemed pretty inept in protecting the witness and getting the goods on the perp. (When they find the guns hidden in his house that match the shell casings at the murder scenes, the DA won't prosecute because the perp will say someone else pulled the trigger???)

The problem is that his accuser, Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens), is a prostitute and, at the time, rape of a prostitute wasn't taken seriously. Paulson escaped as Hansen was loading supplies into his plane, or she would have been his next murder victim. She runs away handcuffed and barefoot, and is picked up by a passing truck driver. The movie leaves this out, which I think is its biggest shortcoming. At the police station retiring Detective Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage) is brought on to the case after other skeptical detectives don't want anything to do with it. Halcombe (a composite character of the real detective Glenn Flothe) is desperately trying to convince a judge to issue a search warrant for Hansen's home. There are flashbacks to another murder that dramatized how Hansen flew his victims out to the woods and hunted them. Some of the movie is dramatized, but sticks the actual details during most of it. Chilling is how normal Hansen presents himself (the actual FBI profile was spot-on).",The Frozen Ground

Sadly, that's probably due to Nic Cage, which is a shame. First, he's very subdued and focused (there's no wild-man Nicholas Cage in this movie). In fact, he plays a deeply decent, dedicated Alaska State Trooper who becomes convinced that a serial killer (also very well played by a creepy John Cusack) is stalking women in Anchorage. The film downplays the gore, while showing the seedy and soul-crushing underworld where Cusack finds his victims. A very nice bonus is that almost all of the police officers shown in the film are hard-working people who want to catch this killer, but know they have to work within the law to ensure he doesn't escape them in the courts. Vanessa Hudgins turns in a very nice performance as one victim who escaped and was instrumental in identifying the killer.

I loved Frozen Ground from the beginning to end.Honestly, i did not know about serial-killer Robert Hanson till I saw this awesome movie describing in detail is totally evil crimes.The fact that Hanson was a respected, kinda normal member of the community, successfully hiding his true colors, makes us wonder how many times we daily see people who seem a completely normal. But live a double life, ala Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Hanson was that sort. But could not fool paratrooper investigator Jack, a real man, brilliantly portrayed by Nicholas.100% i loved Frozen Ground, giving it a 7/10.Nicolas was also 100% awesome in this one. But we all know some times he scores big, other times he is horrible. This time he nailed.I feel that Frozen Ground is worth of your time.",The Frozen Ground
130,RanDizzle1198,Chilling and shocking but a bit slow.,8,27 May 2020,I think this film would have been much better had more of this perverse man's crimes been explained. It barely scratches the surface though I had never heard of Robert Hansen until this film. I simply had to read up on him and his crime spree was shocking. I only wish that his crimes were better explained so as to draw the viewer into the story further and increase the hate you simply don't fully feel watching the film. All in all it was a terrific film with beautiful cinematography at times of the Alaskan wilderness. It does draw the viewer into the film nicely but feel it would have been more if this man's crimes were further explained. Wonderful acting and portrayal of characters. Thumbs up.,The Frozen Ground
131,jcuccini,Really good movie and a horribly disturbing story.,7,15 January 2021,"Some people have complained that there was no mystery because the killer was revealed in the beginning but since this actually happened it's not a valid complaint. It's like making a movie about Gacy and letting it be known from the start that he was a serial killer. I thought the acting was well done including Vanessa Hudgens who plays the young woman who escaped Hanson and with her help he was brought to justice. Nicholas Cage and John Cusack are also really good. The movie takes place in Alaska, I don't know if it was filmed there but it definitely looks like it, the outdoor scenes in the mountains as well as the darkness of the city and the dreary cloudiness of that time of year in Alaska.I know there was a lot more to the story than was told but there's also only so much that you can reasonably fit into a movie and the main focus was how this young woman was so instrumental in ending a long reign of terror by a horrible murderer. It's not an uplifting story because even though the murder was caught it wasn't until well after he had ended so many innocent lives.",The Frozen Ground

Nicolas Cage, and all other actors, especially Vanessa Hudgens and John Crusack did an amazing job. I didn't mind the way they filmed the movie - I don't think it was a budget choice, I think it was a choice of a certain style. It is shakey in certain parts, but in no way a bother. The storytelling is slow, but very tense and disturbing; yet it didn't glorify violence. It really made me feel sick at times. It isn't your typical Hollywood Crime, there is not much action and no special effects. The way they constructed the movie is more than plausible. If they tried to go into depth into the investigation, Hansen's background and his relationships - this would've been more like a 3 hour movie, or it would've needed a TV show like Mindhunters. I really suggest to give ""The Frozen Ground"" a go and ignore the current 6.4 rating, because in my opinion it's much better than that.",The Frozen Ground

It is not action packed, but it's based on a true story, which yes means dry to a point - think Zodiac, but not as good. It is tragically horrifying what people do/get away with. I was into it despite Vanessa Hudgens, but, at the end, they starting showing the real life victims pics and then it became really rough.Overall, the story was good, the photography was great and the acting better than average.

Truly, we enjoy suspenseful thrillers, but this is one that would have better with some editing, or there are scenes that didn't provide much purpose. I can think of about 15 minutes that could be left out. Cannot blame the acting--Cage and Cusack are good, but even they would be better served if some of their scenes were left out, and the movie became more watchable. Too many ""Cindy"" scenes, too many scenes of Cage with his family, perhaps true, but unnecessary. I would have liked to see a re-enactment of ""Cindy's"" ""escape,"" but that important scene probably didn't work out so well. Generally, a severely grim look at Anchorage--there was no ""Thank you"" to the City for this portrayal either.",The Frozen Ground

140,cmahoney9-120-805838,Poor Execution Overall,2,2 September 2013,"The premise offers quite a lot, two well known actors in a battle of wits - acting out a real life serial killer case. Problem is is that the serial killer is in custody for a good part of the ending and the cop does not square off with him to release the tension. There is barely any tension and absolutely no payoff, only the female lead crying her eyes out for most of the movie. She is always crying, always swearing and it's just distracting. I get it - you're a whore, I understand that from the very beginning - yet we get more and more of how much she is a whore - all the whore things she goes through. Her main line is: What the F? All movie long.It's never a good idea to put your good guy and bad guy in the same room half way through the story. Again, no payoff. But this is a true story, so I'm sure that is what they had to do. Maybe it shouldn't have been made. Played out like an R rated CSI show. Was looking forward to seeing Cusak in this.I'm still hearing the girl cry and curse as I type. Unnecessary to say the least.",The Frozen Ground

142,tradewinds68,Brilliant psychological thriller!,10,4 January 2014,"I watched this movie out of curiosity and wasn't expecting the seamless and suspenseful film that it was. I haven't seen much of Nicolas Cage's movies recently since they haven't held much interest for me, however, he was incredible in The Frozen Ground, as was John Cusack. Cage plays an Alaskan State Trooper, Jack Halcombe, who reluctantly takes on a serial killer case two weeks before his resignation. His complete polar opposite, the serial killer Robert Hansen, is aptly played by John Cusack who brings an atmosphere of evil to the role. This film reinforces the quality of both these actors and takes what might have been a mediocre film with different actors, to a whole new level.The chemistry between Halcombe and the only living victim of Hansen, Cindy Paulson, played brilliantly by Vanessa Hudgens, is amazing. It's clear that Halcombe wants to protect her but she makes the task difficult, along with the increasingly menacing presence of Hansen once he realises she is working with the police. I would definitely recommend this movie which is understated in its ability to entertain, scare and engage the viewer.",The Frozen Ground
143,art-miller,"Not bad, but it is disturbing.",7,15 March 2019,"It is strange how TV series and films concentrate on murder all the time...and particularly on the murder of women. It does leave a bad taste in the mouth. There are some genuinely disturbing scenes here with women chained and mercilessly humiliated.What is worse is then knowing that this is based on a real case. You almost rather it was fiction.Cage does quite well in a desperate sort of way. Only gives us one half smile. throughout. This is appropriate to the subject.Lots of gratuitous nudity.And why, oh why, don't the producers of films check with their final edit than you can actually hear what the actors are saying...?

146,shawneuser,Should have been much better... missed opportunity,6,24 April 2014,"With the best from Nic Cage that we've seen in years, one of the worst serial killers in American history as a backstory, and the beautiful Alaskan countryside as a backdrop, this COULD have been a really good movie.Instead, apparently, production didn't think there was enough suspense in the actual story and decided, predictably, to contrive some on their own. Either that or they just wanted to give Vanessa Hudgens as big a role as possible. Either one might explain the ultimately annoying subplot that had Hudgens' character, Cindy, repeatedly endangering herself and the entire case against the killer by trying to run off, even though repeatedly warned that she was in danger and told she was needed to put the guy away and save lives. The need for contrived suspense would explain why everyone from the Alaskan PD to the DA seemed bent on convincing the lead investigator that he had no case. All oddly oblivious to the notion of a serial killer operating in their midst, preying on their wives and daughters. In fact, strangely enough, virtually everyone in the movie other than Cage and his sidekick seem unconcerned about it, including Cindy and Cage's wife. It also would explain the somewhat ridiculous subplot, which essentially depicts the killer as a mafioso who hires a henchmen to abduct Cindy again. And, of course, Cindy almost runs right into his arms. Regardless, probably the main reason why the ending falls flat is because the screenplay didn't adequately convince us of the monster that Robert Hansen is/was. John Cusack, in the role, spends most of his time looking darkly pensive. He is actually shown kidnapping, abusing, and then shooting only one girl. It is a disturbing part, sure, but still mostly lacking the horror of what Hansen actually did. The pretty victim is fully dressed the whole time, and a few hair caresses are the only suggestion we get of Hansen's sexual depravity. It is almost like the movie was trying to be PG, even though it is already R thanks to the strip club scenes. John Cusack does well in the role, and it is no fault of his that his character comes off as more nerdish than evil. It is the screenplay that fails.As a movie about a serial killer, it is not disturbing enough. As a thriller, it relies too much on predictable contrivances. As a character study, it relies too much on tired clichés.",The Frozen Ground
147,MtnShelby,Surprisingly Good Thriller,8,9 June 2014,"I'm not sure why I had such low expectations for this film--I ought to know by now that many blockbusters are poor films, and many sleepers are great films. This is a sleeper that is well worth watching. Based on a grim but fascinating true story, the film is riveting from start to finish. Great scenery, a solid script, terrific acting, and steady pacing. While other reviewers have offered well-earned accolades for the two male leads' performances, I'd like to give a shout out to Vanessa Hudgens, who brings to her character the perfect combination of fragility and toughness, innocence and world-weariness. Her fine performance creates a great deal of empathy for an otherwise potentially unlikable character. This isn't a new take on prostitution by any means, but Hudgens adds a depth to the character I didn't expect. Well done. If you're even the slightest bit intrigued by this film--don't pass it by.",The Frozen Ground
148,fvwyk1-804-458094,I don't really know what I enjoyed about this,3,28 February 2014,"This film ticks all the boxes. Solid acting, good cinematography (I really love the scenic Alaskan nature scenes), a good solid script based on true events. But for some reason I kept drifting away thinking of other things.Something that really annoyed me is the fact that some of the reenactments of the film, did not ring very true, even though it factually follows the actual events quite closely. For some reason I struggle to believe that Anchorage has such a thriving Red light district with Strip clubs and pimps and hookers on every corner, as portrayed in the film. I have never been there, but it just seems like the movie wanted to either glamorize or exaggerate the seedy underground that you find in cities (Note that Anchorage is probably more of a town than a city). This type of sensationalism that was also present in the ""group orgy type scenes"" in the ""Wolf of Wallstreet"" seems to be a new angle Hollywood tries to incorporate in films based on true events. It is really annoying, as it clearly aims to ""spice up"" the actual events, although it actually dumbs it down in my opinion.I think it is the lack of background story especially on the part of the antagonist played by Cusack, as well as the victim, Hudgens and the protagonist played by Cage. Although their acting is quite top notch, I am not sure if the script did any of the characters a favor. This was obviously not an attempt at a documentary, merely a dramatization, that failed to keep my attention, especially with the laughable Bells and Whistles. I would much rather recommend the Australian thriller ""The Snowtown Murders"" if you are into remakes/dramatizations of real life serial killers.",The Frozen Ground
149,stuartdonovan24,Ice cool accuracy but melted viewing,4,3 April 2014,"It seems with The Frozen Ground the writers tried to keep as much to the facts and actual events that it was based upon. That in itself is admirable, it does, however, make for very dull viewing. In theory it has all the ingredients of an excellent serial killer nightmare; two strong leading men in Cusack & Cage with decent support from Mitchell, Hudgens and Kevin Dunn. None of these players though is given anything good to work with and sadly they all appear understated. Cusack plays Hansen a serial killer leaving an unnoticed trail of dead but never found prostitutes until one body is recovered and one working girl escapes his clutches. Sgt Halcombe(Cage) sets in motion an investigation trailing back as far back as thirteen years into the known disappearances. Halcombe tries to work with the escapee Cundy(Hudgens) but she is reluctant to help. All of these variables put into the mix should have made for a tense battle of wits between Halcombe & Hansen but script wise it offers little to inject and suspense or menace, something Cusack must be disappointed with. Cage is actually the most understated of all, he just drifts through as mildly as a family man would. The aforementioned support just seem to be making up the numbers. So it doesn't build to and kind of climax it just fades into a non event and a sequence of ""Where are they now"" subtitles about the players.",The Frozen Ground
150,LordManhammer,Suspense hits the wrong target,4,10 February 2021,"Crime thrillers follow two main paths: either the audience is kept in suspense as to who the killer is, or the audience knows all along and waits to see the cat-and-mouse game between the killer and police.The problem with this movie is that it attempts to choose the latter, but the suspense is based not on any clever moves the killer makes to avoid detection or a detective's ingenious moves to find evidence and trick the killer into making mistakes. Instead, the only suspense is Sgt. Halcombe's attempts to overcome the obstacles in his path--namely other police investigators' incompetence, a skeptical DA, and his own nagging wife.In addition, there is so little back story or detail about the killer that he appears as a straw man in the plot. He is supposedly an upstanding citizen with a clean record, yet Halcombe does uncover previous convictions that are never squared with the APD captain's refusal to pursue the case. The few scenes of Hansen at his bakery do not go far enough in establishing how this felon has, in the past few years, established himself as a beloved figure in Anchorage--especially given the way Hansen acted during questioning when Halcombe finally arrested him. He acted not at all charming, clever, or intelligent, a far cry from the personality he would need to move on from his jail time and convincingly portray a successful businessman and family man.",The Frozen Ground

154,citizen-caveman,Run-of-the-mill thriller with no surprises but with upsetting scenes,7,24 June 2014,"Alaska 1983 and a state trooper is moving in on a suspected serial- killer. The film is 'based on actual events' so where fact ends and fiction takes over is anyone's guess, unless you have much knowledge of the actual events. 'The Frozen Ground' is similar to '8mm' given the common themes, a detective goes after whoever is committing sexual crimes against vulnerable females, and Nicolas Cage stars in both central roles. Though 'The Frozen Ground' is an edge-of-your-seat thriller whilst '8mm' is a murky detective-mystery. This can be hard to watch. There are graphic, and potential upsetting, scenes of women in much distress being humiliated and killed. The unflinching depiction of decomposed corpses. The possibility of the suspected killer walking away makes you feel angry. The DP earned his money. There are some spectacular wide-shots of the Alaskan countryside giving a strong sense of place, an ambiance of desolation and that buying that wide-screen television was money well spent after all.

It's nothing new and all done before, but still reasonably entertaining.Cage sleepwalks his way through the script. Hudgens is so-so and gains little sympathy as a character. Cussack is the star and the best thing about the movie. The camera work is extremely frustrating. It's the done thing now to have shaky camera work to add to the tension and feeling the story is trying to convey, but sometimes they just take it too far. Even simple indoor scenes between two people just having a chat results in jerky and unsteady camera movements. It's quite nauseating at times.It's not an awful movie, far from it. It's just not worth the price of a cinema ticket. Better that you spend just a few bucks on a rental or wait for it to appear on TV eventually.",The Frozen Ground
156,mike-3251,Hand held cameras,3,27 May 2014,"Thankfully, hand held cameras have been used in fewer and fewer films the last few years, a trend I am glad to see broken. The only positive thing about handhelds is strictly from the producers viewpoint - they keep the film costs significantly down and eliminate the need to set up scene composition and do any skilled editing, things that normally add to my enjoyment of a movie.The only reason given for their use is that they present a sense of realism but when you think about it, we don't see the world in such a jittery way and all they do is remind us that we are watching a movie, one filmed with handhelds. So there is that.Beyond that, there is little to recommend in this film to offset the very bad visuals. Nick sleepwalks through a very uninteresting film. John Cusack, a personal low role - why is he in this; are there really no scripts? No wonder it made it to Amazon Prime so quickly.",The Frozen Ground
157,alexandruburda,A good movie,7,25 September 2020,"Although it shows real life as it is (with bad things, with no happy endings in most situations and with people having weaknesses they fight with and not always win) the movie is good enough to make one stay untill the end to see the outcome.
Good play from the main protagonists (Cage, Hudgens and Cusak) and a good '80s atmosphere recreation (context, cars, people). But I would have preferred an even better recreation in the way the movie is filmed. This constantly shaking camera effect is not suited in my opinion with the story (it is not an action thriller but a human drama and a difficult criminal investigation) and dilutes much of the chilling effect it has (not to say that is not very suited for big screen watching). It is an old story not a today breaking news event and certainly not a TV crime show. That is the reason the movie gets a 7 stars from me. Otherwise, I can recommend it for a after work movie night (as in my case).",The Frozen Ground

John Cusak was a surprise, he did a good job of making the killer seem like a real guy and that made him scary. He had a family and yet did his serial killing on the side. I am surprised this movie did poorly at the box office. It seems people complain abut the standard Hollywood crap, but then don't go see movies like this.

The movie shows in details how the APD officer Jack along with Cindy (the only survivor among all other victims) & his other associates tries to unfold the mystery.

160,Blonde2291,Nice acting but weak script,5,25 August 2013,"This is a movie based on the true story of a serial rapist and killer Robert Hansen. The movie starts with police finding Cindy Paulson handcuffed in her motel room. Although its a nice start, but it leaves all the details of how she was picked up by Robert Hansen, kidnapped at gun point and taken to his house where he raped her and chained her. Neither do they show how she ran away from Robert Hansen, picked by a truck driver, taken to an inn from where she went to a motel room. All these details are left out which could have made the movie more thrilling right at the beginning. Instead the movie seems to focus more on the sleazy scenes of the topless bars where nude girls are shown over and over again.Although the movie Frozen Ground should be about all the victims of Hansen, it devotes its attention almost entirely to Miss Paulson. There are more than 20 other victims and nothing is shown about them.On the acting front, the two big names of Hollywood - Nicolas Cage and John Cusack have done great work and made the movie worth watching. John Cusack really fits the role of a cold hearted, stammering, serial killer who loves to hunt his victims with his guns. Nicolas Cage has given outstanding performance in the role of an obsessive cop determined to catch the culprit.Overall, the movie does not turn out to be a thrilling serial rapist - serial killer movie where the criminal and the police is playing the cat and mouse games.

161,TerrificTom,Does What A Thriller is Supposed to Do,7,25 October 2013,"I like to read the reviews of movies on IMDb before I watch a movie I know nothing about and sometimes I wonder just what these reviewers expect from a movie. Sexual satisfaction? Seriously. This movie is a thriller and knowing it was based upon actual events added to the thrill and the suspense. Several times while watching it I wanted to click back to IMDb and find out what was going to happen because I didn't know. I assumed the bad guy would get caught, but I didn't know what was going to happen to the girl or any of the other people involved in the case.I thought both Cage and Cusack, whom I don't see in enough movies, did very good journeyman acting work. The girl who was from High School Musical or something? I'd never seen before. But she was very believable as a wild child on the run from her past. The scenes on the streets of anchorage and in the strip clubs were very upsetting to watch. I love the idea of Alaska the Last Frontier and this movie did NOT support that image. This movie did what a movie is supposed to do. Entertain by inspiring thrills, chills and sometimes painful suspense. Not gratify every itchy need in your heart. If your wife hates you before you watch this movie, she'll still hate you after the movie. If your job sucks and you watch this movie, your job will still suck after you watch it.

165,preemptiveselfdefense,Relatively positive review title,7,23 August 2013,"Considering how many people watch Law and Order, and all it's...offspring, this movie should appeal to a ton of people. But, expectations are different for movies. Which is funny nowadays since most movies are watched just the same as TV shows: w/our collective butts majestically grafted to the couch (or whatever it is you enjoy sitting on). Would I pay for a movie ticket for this? No, but due to some strange economic magic, as movie ticket's increase in price I go to the movies less. Hollywood's response has been to stop throwing money at original ideas. Which is also strange, but in a non-sarcastic, seriously wtf are they thinking? kind of way (my friend texted me that Ben Affleck is going to be the next Batman. I could try to verify that but why bother? If it's true, I don't need that banging around in my skull. There's nowhere to put that information, no ""spot"" for it. Unless Kevin Smith directed it and had Affleck play a severely stoned {yet angst-ridden} Silent Bob/Batman hybrid. With like one grappling hook. And no rope. Yes, that would be awful too. As well. In addition. Remember Daredevil? I don't, and I forgot to feel lucky about that today. Probably bs anyway). I think I had a point. Yeah, this movie. Okay:Nicholas Cage is truly the everyman. Most days I go to work I do a pretty good job. I have the ability to excel and do on occasion. And sometimes I just don't give a funk and kill time until I get my paycheck. I would say this is the ""fairly good job"" Cage here. He doesn't give off the impression he was hung over and just looked at his bank statement when he signed up for the job. His part is present for the bulk of the film and he carries it well enough, though Vanessa Hudgins(sp?) adds a lot as well. I'm just glad he's still digging in his heels and not going straight to DVD w/out a fight.John Cusack gets to be homicidal and weird, but in an unpleasant way this time. So that's somewhat rare. I thought he did a good job. Seems like I should have more to say about it. It was a subdued performance, maybe that's why.Good supporting cast too. Dean Norris and that one guy and that other guy that are both good but you never actually remember who they are all turn in good performances. My only general complaint, if you could even call it that, is I remembered/realized it was a ""true story"" movie about a 1/3 of the way thru. Pacing gives it away, I guess. Life doesn't go by whatshisnuts screenplay beats/hits formula or whatever they're all using now.Don't worry, I do have some specific complaints. Going backwards here, the ending sequence I found to be borderline awful/laughable. Then again, I can't justify the existence of Nickelback fans and whichever band is playing at the end wishes they could open for Nickelback. At first it's alright where they're giving you the ""here's how it turned out"" facts over some scenes of looking for the bodies. All to the tune of the often-overbearing symphony score playing (more on that in a sec). But then it cuts to photos of the 17 women they know Robert Hansen killed and this lame ass rock song starts playing. Not lame rock ballad, more lame uptempo-ish vaguely positive sounding rock. Which seems out of place in what is a sort of video memorial for 17 women that got raped, tortured, hunted, murdered and buried in the snow by John Cusack (They do show the 18th woman that managed to escape/survive, so that's nice. Doesn't quite save it though, for me anyway).Other grievance is I couldn't make out a couple sentences here and there, even after playing them over several times. They weren't too quiet or too accented or anything, but it was a problem in one place where I still don't know quite what she said. Especially in the beginning they throw a lot of info at you in a few spots. One character even goes, ""Hold on"" in the middle of one of those moments, then proceeds to not summarize anything and confuse things slightly more instead (well, not really...but kinda).The music score. Yeah, it's loud sometimes. Sorta sucks. Annoys me that some music editor thinks he can make me ""feel"" something by blasting a string section at my head. I've found the screenplay and the actors better suited to that task.All in all, it's good. Didn't have that incomplete feeling a lot of true crime stuff leaves me with. There were some nice touches here and there. Random stuff that didn't serve the story or hamper it, just kinda made it more real (starting to talk at the same time, wife being inexplicably insensitive to a rape victim, stuff like that). Go ahead, watch it. It's not like you were going to cure cancer today anyway.Unless that's your job, in which case don't watch this crap. Get back to work and cure that crap so we can all smoke again (aah, the early 1900's....even babies smoked. What a country!)",The Frozen Ground
166,paavanpshukla,A terrifying true story is great,8,30 September 2013,"The Frozen Ground was artful, uncomfortable and absolutely spectacular. The film, based on a true story, is the perfect example of how truth is stranger than fiction. The Frozen Ground follows the story of Alaskan State Trooper Sgt. Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage) as he tries to catch a serial killer that has not been caught in 13 years. With prostitutes' bodies being found in Anchorage, the public begins to panic and Halcombe knows that he needs to catch the killer soon. Robert Hansen (John Cusack) is the serial killer and a well-known man in the town. The citizens would hardly believe that he would hurt the women. One prostitute, Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens), escapes from Hansen and helps Halcombe by giving him new information for catching the killer. After giving up the information, Paulson fears for her life and wants the killer caught before she is captured again. This film is a suspenseful thriller rather than an action film. The story gets down the dirty details and makes sure that the viewer leaves knowing everything that happened. It doesn't glorify the characters or anything that happened to them. It simply tells this horrifying tale. For a suspenseful film, The Frozen Ground was absolutely terrifying. It wasn't Saw or The Conjuring, but it was a quiet horror of a menacing man. While it was a classic catch a killer before the evidence disappears story, the actors brought their characters to such a real light. The movie was predictable because it was the same movie that is repeated every once in a while. Good guy works really hard to catch bad guy with the help of someone whose life has been affected by the case. However, the acting in the film is what brought it to life. Everyone in the film really fell into their characters and, as far as I could tell, really took on the life of whom they were playing. Cusack made a lasting impression in his role as a serial killer. He is disturbing while convincing everyone around him that he could never be a serial killer that literally hunts women. Every word dripped off of Cusack in such a creepy yet normal way that it brought Hansen to life. Cage hasn't been in any good movies recently but The Frozen Ground reminded me of when he was really at his prime. He was incredibly intense in every scene and every time that Cage was playing a frustrated Halcombe, his face seemed to feel the frustrated words. Surprisingly, Hudgens had an amazing performance. In some parts of the film, she outshined Cage. The 24-year-old played a 17-year-old prostitute flawlessly. This film is much, much better than Spring Breakers and Sucker Punch. She actually acted in the movie, rather than running around in her underwear. When Paulson was scared for her life, Hudgens could understand and translate that well. The best part of the film, however, was the end when the filmmakers made the creative decision to show the stories and pictures of the actual victims that Hansen killed. It is what actually brought the story back to the real world. These weren't just fictional characters we were watching, they were living girls who were hunted by a psycho killer.",The Frozen Ground
167,livingstone100,Excellent thriller.,8,15 November 2014,"So much more deserving than the 6.5 currently showing.Cusack can be hit and miss with the roles he accepts with a very mixed history of eclectic and well scripted parts mixed with some shockers.Cage, like Travolta, either has a bad agent or will do anything for money.Fortunately both shine in this cat and mouse game which proves that a good story and snappy acting easily trumps a big budget.This nail biter is like Law & Order on steroids, so as a fan of this TV show I loved this movie.One of the better serial killer movies out there, not quite Silence of The Lambs but will not disappoint fans of the genre.",The Frozen Ground
168,Malamut,A chilling realistic serial-killer movie,7,23 August 2013,"I have been interested in serial killers for some time now and I am familiar with the real story upon which the movie is based. Although Cage and Cusack have starred in some sub par movies over the last few years, they are both quite talented and give excellent performances in this effort. However, the real star of the film, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, is Hudgens, who makes her character look very real and believable. Although the plot has been heavily misused in other films in the past and is not in itself very original, this is not your typical serial- killer movie. The movie manages to be compelling without going over the top with too much gory details. The atmosphere it creates is very authentic - it really takes you back 30 years ago in Alaska, when these gruesome events unfolded.",The Frozen Ground

Overall though, held my attention through the whole thing.Vanessa Hudgens does really great as Cyndi. You really feel for her. Nick Cage surprised because he's been in so much cheesy stuff and just bad performances after 2005, but he is also very good as the state trooper. I though Cusacks performance was flat. Like, coulda got anyone.The film noir quality and the cold Alaska nights and darkness give the entire movie a sense of dread. Nothing is really sensationalized. It's just a story of good old fashioned cop work and chasing down all leads to catch a dirtbag preying on women on the fringes of society. I recommend.",The Frozen Ground

I was mesmerised, disgusted and in the end found the redemption it delivers. Great filmography, excellent use of music. Such a tragic story. Haunting film. Memorable. What film should be - and often isn't. John Cusack's performance pitch perfect. Not a film for a date night but so worthy of your time, attention and reflection.

And a note here, is the performance of Vanessa Hudgens, it was so realistic and convincing, and i liked the role she took and how she played it well, although that i watched several films for her, and i didn't like her performance, but in this one, she was like she is the real girl, back at 1983.So an amazing movie, the actors were so great, the story and the actions in the movie were so interesting, and well played.The real story of the serial killer Robert Hansen was terrifying and indeed, a great film could be written based on her. and this is the case here.",The Frozen Ground

173,trando5,Based on True Events,7,22 March 2021,"Watched this show because it was recommended through a podcast I was listening to about Robert Hansen. It was a pretty good movie but it was nothing special. I feel like this was one of those movies you can have on in the background and watch but not really have to pay full attention to understand everything. Basically its about Cindy Paulson was a victim of Robert Hansen but managed to escape and tell cops her story. And its her point of view as well as the special agent who was in charge of the serial killer case.It was a decent watch but I would really have liked if they had shown more of how Cindy was able to escape. Having listened to the podcast and then watched this I really don't think they show how strong Cindy was for escaping her situation and how smart she was. They also don't really dwell on how horrible of a job the Alaskan cops did when it came to this case. There were numerous reports and complaints filed against Robert Hansen and nothing was really done because people knew Robert and were dismissive of the girls.I think seeing less of the cops family background and maybe more of Robert Hansens would have made this more interesting too. Or maybe even more of Cindy Paulson's background. But the Special agents background just did not add much to the story.The acting was pretty good. Was excited to see Kurt Fuller and Nicolas Cage since its been a while since I saw a movie from either of those two. And Vanessa Hudgens does a great job too. John Cusack was amazing as the killer cause he could go from quiet to crazy and angry which was really weird to see and I really think that he actually kind of looked like the guy too.Overall, good to see if you want a basic knowledge of the killings. Not the best if you have issues with sexual assault, murder and drugs.",The Frozen Ground
174,HerveD,A nice thriller,7,11 May 2014,"If you liked 'Kissed the girls"" (1997) featuring Morgan Freeman and Ashely Judd, you'll probably like ""Frozen ground"", as there are many similarities in the story.Set in Alaska, the story follows a law enforcement agent Jack (Nicolas Cage) chasing a serial murderer and rapist. Everything links to the same man: Robert (John Cusack). With the miraculous escape of one of the kidnapped victim Cindy (Vanessa Hudgens), Jack is hoping to find tangible evidence to arrest the suspect. However, nothing is simple and Cindy is pretty unpredictable.There isn't much suspense about the culprit as we know very early his identity, instead the focus is much more on whether the unrelenting Jack will be able to gather sufficient evidence to convict the suspect and prevent further murders. The movie overall is pretty good and the acting of Vanessa Hudgens and John Cusack is excellent.",The Frozen Ground

This is not a documentary and is not intended to be. The movie doesn't investigate the serial killer relationships, the background, nor try to explain the exceptional investigating work of the police. Most of the negative reviews I have read point on these shortcomings, but this is simply a thriller and it does what it has to do: it thrills you, from the beginning to the end. Considering what is being proposed usually as thriller, this is worth to be watched and it is entertaining. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it a good movie? Yes.",The Frozen Ground

177,m_antrim1,Absolutely Terrible!!!,1,17 October 2013,"I live in Alaska and remember this story well. I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it was released and - POOF! - it opened in one theater and then disappeared, going directly to video within a couple of months. After watching the video, I now understand why.This should have been an exciting movie. This is the classic story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"" brought to life. The case involved a serial killer in the last frontier that involved a dramatic investigation, interagency wrangling and some solid investigative work by a few officers that just wouldn't give up. The movie had a solid cast which should, with such a story line, made for a riveting movie.What a bomb. The acting was flat or overplayed. Everyone seemed to be swearing for effect, and really need to go back to acting school and re-study the lessons on how to portray anger. The movie doesn't begin to touch on Hanson's life, his relationship with his wife and kids, the support he had from his friends, and the utter horror of the crimes he committed. The story also missed on actions of the police involved. This case revolutionized the criminal justice system in Alaska, forging new information-sharing protocols between agencies, ending the competitive turf wars. The story missed the later story with Hanson. He made a plea bargain, agreeing to assist the investigators in finding the bodies in return for not having to serve time in Alaska. He was placed in a federal prison outside of Alaska. When the State ended its contract to hold prisoners in federal facilities, Hanson was returned to Alaska and lodged at the facility in Juneau. He attempted to escape.Anyway, it's too bad that this movie was made.",The Frozen Ground

181,dixiedragon,Darkly Rich Unconventional Serial Killer Movie,7,6 December 2015,"Erring on the side of caution I marked spoiler however, the alleged killer is revealed at the beginning of the movie so it's not really a spoiler. Not much that I can add that has not already been said however I want to give kudos to actor Vanessa Hudgens who plays a young street prostitute and victim of serial rapist and killer Robert ""Bob"" Hansen aptly played by John Cusack, who is ultimately pursued with the fervor that all victims deserve by Jack Halcombe played brilliantly by Nicolas Cage. Hudgins whose best work prior to this was mediocre at best, BECAME Cindy (the prostitute). Just a fine fine job of acting, a joy to watch even though her role was so desperate and dark. You BELIEVED her. From the barely audible story about her uncle to her ordeal at the hands of Hansen. She WAS Cindy, not someone pretending to be Cindy. Big Kudos. Despite the director's best efforts they did not do a good enough job of background to call this a character driven piece although without the excellent job done by all the plot which is slow at times would have fallen flat.The Alaskan State Troopers, local police and National Guard worked with tireless determination to bring this psychopath (who enjoyed a quiet peaceful church going, pillar of the community, life with a wife and 2 children) to justice for the deaths of dozens of young women. Early on they reveal the killer, then build the plot around their pursuit. He is cagey, sneaky and leaves no trail behind – he is spic and span clean. Does a good job of showing that psychopaths are deeply misunderstood by the public as some of our greatest leaders – in the political, economic, and scientific worlds – are by definition psychopaths. Cusack does a great job of portraying the singular, focused, dedicated pursuit of his criminal mind while living a parallel life of the utmost decency.In my opinion, Halcombe (Cage) was ALSO a psychopath – I don't know if it was intentional by the screenwriters or if it simply fell into play this brilliant side by side comparison of how being a psychopath can lead to a life of dedication to justice or it can lead to a life of depravity. Halcombe was singularly dedicated to catching his prey (Cusack), working his way through the darkly seedy underworld of prostitution, the sale and trade of women as commodities, the soul stealing depraved world of human trafficking with tireless focus, determined not to fail in bringing his criminal to justice where others had failed costing dozens more lives – all while living a life of normalcy with his wife and child.As ""true"" stories go, the writers and directors did an excellent job here working with what they had – 2 hours to drive home these characters, and the plot – the pursuit of enough evidence to prosecute and CONVICT Bob (Cusack). Unlike most ""true"" stories they did not take a lot of literary license but were definitely shackled by what would and would not be suitable for a movie. However, these characters (including Halcombe) are MUCH deeper and the protagonist (Bob/Cusack) was not just a psychopath, he was deeply depraved from an early age. You also don't see the back story of how we via our thirst for energy, for oil, and building the Alaskan pipeline, opened the door for the dark criminal underworld to secure roots in such a previously pristine environment. (On that note, the cinematography was just awesome!) I strongly suggest reading Fair Game by Bernard DuClos whose research for his book was astonishingly rich and thorough.",The Frozen Ground

It made me nauseous. 1st act and 3rd didn't stink but were still full of clichés and totally predictable. 2nd act you're just wondering why the cops don't just, I don't know, watch the serial killer and see if he, I don't know, tries to hurt anyone. In the beginning of the film the serial killer is listed as a suspect but for 95% of the movie you got some cliché boring district attorney saying they need more evidence. It's all BS and so far from the truth of the real life killings the story is based on. The writer/director basically just took a cookie cutter approach to stamp in all the things audiences have seen before. John Cusack was really good. Best I've ever seen him.

Imagine what this movie would have looked like if shot professionally and on maybe film? Even Super 8 would look better then the consumer grade cams used. Clearly someone dropped the ball when deciding on film equipment and camera operators. If it was solely a cost savings choice, I think they made the wrong choice.

200,hidexyq-115-88714,Big big disappointment,2,31 March 2014,The Frozen Ground is not an interesting film and it's not worth watching if you're in the mood for a thrilling intelligent movie but if you don't have anything to do and you would like to make fun of very bad John Cusack acting this is the movie for you. I actually really like John Cusack and I was shocked and disappointed that he did not put a better performance. Movie director could have done way better job with nice cast and solid budget but everything in this movie seems so forced and far stretched that in the end he just decides to break down the movie in last 5 minutes and that turns out terrible. You can sleep peacefully if you just skip this one.,The Frozen Ground
201,isaonewaystreet,Decent,7,27 May 2014,"Movie was not that elaborated taking into consideration the complexity of this case. That said, performances were quite decent when dealing with such a heavy plot and a repetitive script. Cage was surprisingly moderate on his expressions while Cusack's black chilling eyes would do the rest.When you're to watch one of these guys' movies you're used to sit and wait for that single moment when the plot or script or Cage's ridiculous reactions smashes the whole project into pieces. I have to confess that I was waiting for that moment to come up; but no. The movie stayed clean and without many sudden changes.Well done. It was about time.",The Frozen Ground
202,ds80909,Meh,3,6 September 2020,Nothing new here. Stereotypes on top of stereotypes. Written for the unimaginative crowd. A decent performance by Vanessa. A paycheck for Cage. And Cusac as a demented killer as scary Ned Flanders.,The Frozen Ground
203,penelope-herbert,I had to double check it was Vanessa Hudgens; she did an outstanding job,8,29 August 2013,"A friend put me on to this movie; I hadn't actually heard about it. So I watched it without knowing the plot. I've always liked both Nicholas Cage and John Cusack and neither was really playing to type. But Vanessa Hudgens blew me away with her performance of Cindi Paulson. She totally stole the show and deserves to be on the awards list this year. Her portrayal of a young dancer/prostitute was very mature; I'm sure she dug deep to find the breadth of emotions from laid back and chilled to entirely terrified. I can thoroughly recommend it to people who like murder mysteries. And for a first time major film Director, Scott did an awesome job! Terrific build up, mature direction, and very solid editing.",The Frozen Ground
204,Psalmsat51,"As a female, it is horrifying to even think about.",8,28 May 2014,"This movie definitely keeps you on edge. The fact that it is based on true and horrific events is what keeps you glued, as you try to understand and get into the mind of someone like this person. You want to know why there are perverts and just plain evil people out there that can go to these extremes. You want to understand what makes them tick. You want to know how they can lead such a double life without those closest to them even having a clue. As a female, it is horrifying to even think about. It is also sad that so many people look down upon the victims because of their lifestyle. They forget these women are someone's mother, daughter, sister, aunt, niece or friend. If more people would reach out to them and listen to their stories rather than judge them, then maybe more of them would come out from the lifestyle they've chosen. Maybe there would be less victims of such horrific crimes. We are all equal in God's eyes; therefore, who is man to judge otherwise. I pray for these victims families, and for those who are currently still out there missing ...there are so many that your heart just bleeds for them.",The Frozen Ground

206,denaina,About a serial killer in Alaska,7,28 September 2014,"The movie was OK. Hence the 7/10 review. I thought they were good at capturing and filming in legitimate Alaskan locations. However, when they started introducing the Minnesota-like accents (NOT Alaskan) and couldn't pronounce Knik right (they said KI-nick, instead of k- NICK), I knew they hadn't done their homework. Oh well. Try again, boys.To summarize, because apparently that is what is required by this ridiculous website, there's a serial killer who's a baker in Alaska who kidnaps young prostitutes, tortures them, then kills them. They catch him because he's dumb and sloppy. This is based on a true story that most of those raised in Alaska know. They try to make it very dramatic because it's a movie and almost certainly most of it is inaccurate. Even so, it's a pretty good watch. The mispronunciation of Knik made me mad, however. Why take the time and expense to film in Anchorage (at least partially) when you're not going to take the time and effort to understand how to pronounce key place names??",The Frozen Ground
207,Trevor-20,Vanessa Hudgen's performance was spectacular,9,23 August 2014,"Vanessa Hudgens should have received Academy Award consideration. Her acting was so intense that there was moments when I needed turn away from the screen. She captured the terror and confusion that all terribly abused woman must experience.Like Vanessa's performance, Nicolas Cage's performance transcended my usual movie-going experience. I'm wondering if he took this role because he ardently believes in the values that his character portrayed. I think that this film was more than just a paycheck for him.John Cussack is an incredibly successful actor. He didn't need to take on such risky project. It was his assignment to portray a monster, and that he did. I'm reminded of Robin Williams performance in Insomnia.",The Frozen Ground
208,makie86,Two icons clash,7,25 November 2020,"Decent movie! Would loved to see cage and Cusack switch roles in this. Both held their own and did justice to this true story. Kept me interested throughout whole movie! When we think of Cage, we always think of his wild man roles and wonder what he will do next. He played this straight and it felt normal watching him play a normal detective role. Overall cast was great. Even 50 cent didn't come across as too corny as a pimp.",The Frozen Ground
209,jean-22462,Nicolas Cage like,3,19 October 2020,"Lacks substance and is full of useless filler in an attempt to make the view relate to one of the characters. An interesting plot though, and could have been better if it was half an hour shorter.",The Frozen Ground
210,JameEarl,Stupid,1,28 October 2021,Stupid girl! Always doing the opposite of what she was told for he own safety over and over...just frustrating to watch. Never had enough evidence to convict time and again....just not good ! For me anyway..... no Bueno.,The Frozen Ground
211,jclive-1,Change of pace from typical serial killer flick,8,24 October 2013,"This isn't a stylistic, creepy, gory, tense cat & mouse movie about a serial killer. It is a slower, more realistic story about an Alaskan state trooper, a 17-year old victim who survived, their relationship, and how a killer was caught along the way.As others have stated, Cusack is wickedly good as the bad guy. He was perfectly cast as the everyman - has a family, is a business owner, is liked in the community - who has a secret. Just like the neighbors said about Jeffrey Dahler ""he was such a quiet boy."" Cusack has few lines but excels in the creep factor and finally gets pushed to his limits.I've always been on the Cage bandwagon, and it's refreshing to see him be the actor he is rather than just the crazy, over actor he typically gets paid to be. His character is a mixture of several actual troopers. He lands a clean up job during his last two weeks on the job before moving, and winds up finding multiple missing persons who were victims of the same killer. I never recognized Hudgens until after I viewed the features on the DVD. Her character does come across as a dipshit. But I had to keep reminding myself that I was 17 once and also not so bright - and I didn't have drugs and a messed up childhood to blame. I sometimes wanted to yell at her character ""no dumb girl, don't do that,"" and then I realized that her character would do something just that dumb.Some of the victims were prostitutes, but others weren't. Some were just young and stupid girls who thought they were going on a shoot with a photographer.At the end of the movie and before the credits, they show pictures of the girls killed by Hansen and those thought to have been killed by Hansen (some bodies have never been recovered). What drove Cindy Paulsen at the end was to make sure Hansen never claimed another victim. In a world where no one wants to take responsibility, where no one wants to get involved, it's refreshing that at one point in time, this young woman did make a stand.",The Frozen Ground
212,tmcbrid,Waste of a True Story,2,10 September 2020,Can't blame the actors here. Choices by the screenwriter and director make this one of the worst films I've allowed myself to sit through. Run away....,The Frozen Ground

215,johnlowe-719-748862,Standard Serial Killer story that grips to the end,8,21 July 2013,Saw it late Fri 19/07 at Cineworld Glasgow Cage & Cusack brilliant. Cusack creepy as hell very believable as a serial killer. However really surprised by Hugdens performance very believable and made me want to just give her a cuddle and rescue her. Settings awesome made me fancy a wee trip to Alaska. Go see it grips you from the start and keeps your attention to the end. Please stay after end to understand how many people were affected by the real story. Good directing story laid out well locations give real insight to what happened and how people can be led into trouble by not trusting in themselves and opening up to others. Again showed how cruel males can be to women and how they abuse them. And again shows that the sex industry is just a cover to allow abuse of women and make them feel no one cares about them.,The Frozen Ground
216,petermacneil-774-232864,Cage is excellent......,8,25 August 2013,"Was concerned Nick Cage would be the Nick Cage of late, but it was a nice surprise as he was absolutely fantastic. He really carried this movie and should be given the credit he deserves.Vanessa Hudgens portrayal was very good knowing her previous films were mostly comedic. She made me believe she was her character.Was hoping not to find out who the killer was until later, but as the movie played out, it suited the arrogance of Hansen. Thought Cusack did an adequate job with the material presented.The score was very dramatic and added to the feeling of the moment. Loved the outdoor wilderness scenes as they were mostly well shot, but the inside shots were framed too tight, but that was the style the cinematographer decided on , so it's a matter of opinion or budget.Overall I liked the movie and would rate this as above average. Well done Nick.",The Frozen Ground
217,cristichhhris,"Very,very good movie",10,6 September 2013,"I saw few of the best movies in 2013, but this movie for me, is the best of all. Cage is a good actor, the movie is good because of him in most part. Anyway , this movie will touch your soul . Until the end of the movie, you will love it, because it has a magic inside : the unexpected, the action , the drama and the pure quality of the story, makes one of the very best movies in 2013.A similar movie is Human Trafficking . A movie is good when you cannot forget it and this type of movies are touching your emotional part, this is the reason why this movie is good.Whit this type of movie, you will treasure life much more, you will become much mature and much responsible. You will love life much more.",The Frozen Ground
218,sergiu-andi,Excellent action movie!!!,9,23 September 2013,"In my opinion a highly underrated movie! It has a lot of good moments and excellent thriller, it kept me filled with adrenaline all the time! Do not miss it, it is excellent John Cusack at his very best. I never saw that dark side of him! Please watch it, you will be pleased! In this role, John Cusack is a transformed version of the hit-man from the Grosse Pointe Blank, lfet without any humor and human touch. In the opposit side, Nicolas Cage is now the good guy. I never saw him so focused and so serious in a movie, for sure the police officer role fits him very good! There were a lot of movies being made based on murder true stories, this one in my point of view is in top of that kind of movies. This is a must see!",The Frozen Ground
219,fredngraham,Decent movie that only scratches the surface of Hansen's diabolical crime spree,7,2 October 2013,"This is a decent movie, which ironically would best be viewed on the big screen given the visually arresting shots of the Alaskan landscape except that it had a very tiny release on the big screen, and has most certainly been seen more on-demand and now through the DVD format. In case a viewer of ""The Frozen Ground"" is left unsatisfied with the necessary compression of events, composite characters, etc. that are necessary to produce a movie of less than two hours in length, and want to learn more about the Hansen case that inspired the movie one could do worse then read ""Fair Game"" (http://tinyurl.com/mqssp5z) by Bernard DuClos that was recently republished. Reading it as a companion to themovie will help the viewer of ""The Frozen Ground"" realize the liberties that were inevitably taken to make it suitable for the silver screen as well as understand elements of Hansen's life and killing spree that the picture did not have time to delve into such as more of Hansen's background (which early on indicated a propensity toward crime) and the back story of the whole oil pipeline boom that produced the mafia controlled prostitution/strip bar scene that Hudgen's character is entangled in.",The Frozen Ground
220,josephk006,Watch it,10,27 October 2013,"Based on real events, something that is highly underdone and incredibly needed in our society. Cage and Cusak are believable and there's no high budget garbage used to keep us wowed, the story is more than enough. Go see this movie, if not just to be inspired that their are real heroes actually doing something about our webs of trafficking, abuse and murder. The suspense is built and extended nicely right to the end. I don't think it's a coincidence that true events films about these issues are pushed far under the carpet. This is a real film by filmmakers with actual consciences, wow, what a concept mainstream Hollywood. Keep your wasteful budgets on explosions Hollywood, I'll watch Frozen Ground again.",The Frozen Ground
221,morten-engberg,Crappy!,1,1 November 2013,"The plot and perpetrator was revealed from the start. Their were no surprises in the entire movie. No thrill at all. The story was therefore boring from almost beginning to end. The characters were portrayed poorly and without any depth. The film contains clichés from beginning to end. The scenes were abrupt and without proper flow. Cage awful as usual. But then again, the actors' performances would never stand out because of the poor story flow. Sorry a good actor like 'Hank Schrader' were used here. This film should have been done as a documentary instead. Just plain awful. The end is a weak cup of tea with without any real build-up. Don't waste your time with this. Would not recommend it.",The Frozen Ground
222,archie63,The Frozen Ground,8,28 April 2014,"I believe that this movie was a very week done true crime film. While watching this movie I was constantly on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what was going to happen next. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next and whether or not Robert Hansen was going to finally get caught or not. The major things that I liked about this film was that it allowed me to become a detective, had a triumph of justice in the end, and also the use of emotions from the actors really sold the story. I was so overwhelmed by emotions while watching this movie and i didn't want it to end. I was so happy to find out that Robert Hansen did indeed get caught in the end and is still currently in jail serving his punishment for his crimes committed against those young women. So if your looking for a movie that has suspense and can tore with your emotions then you should watch The Frozen Ground by Scott Walker.",The Frozen Ground
223,aaronstephen,"Great crime thriller, could be better with minor tweaks.",8,3 June 2015,"Really good crime thriller which keeps you hooked right until the end and still guessing what the outcome will be.Some parts can be quite difficult to watch as they can be quite disturbing. However, the role of Robert Hansen is played excellently by John Cusack, who fits into the character's personality perfectly.The story line is gripping with some exciting twists and turns. It would have been better if there was longer time spent finding the right suspect and with other possible culprits rather than just knowing it was Robert Hansen from the beginning but other than that it was a great movie to watch.Would highly recommend to anyone, especially those who enjoy crime thrillers.",The Frozen Ground
