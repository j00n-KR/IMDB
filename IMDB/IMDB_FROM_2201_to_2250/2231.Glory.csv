0,MartinHafer,One of the very best war movies ever.,10,11 December 2011,"Before I talk specifically about this movie, I was very surprised in 1990 during the Academy Awards ceremony. Denzel Washington got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in ""Glory""--even though I felt that Morgan Freeman did a better job in this film. On top of that, Freeman had also turned in a masterful performance this same year in ""Driving Miss Daisy"". Now I am not putting down Washington's acting--he was fine. But to me, it was more Freeman's film and he stood out furthest among this nice ensemble cast.The biggest reasons I liked the movie so much were because it had a deeper message than just war and because it tried to get things right historically. As far as the message goes, it was about racism and black men proving themselves during the Civil War. This was very uplifting and exciting to watch. It also was lovely because as a history teacher, I so often HATE how historical films get all the facts wrong. Here, while it isn't perfect, it is sure close!! I'd say more, but frankly there are already a ton of reviews for this film--suffice to say as a recently retired history teacher, I couldn't recommend the film more.",Glory
1,bkoganbing,For Freedom,10,21 February 2009,"Glory is the story of the men and commander of the 54th Massachusetts, the first black regiment organized after the Emancipation Proclamation culminating in its first full scale military engagement at Fort Wagner in South Carolina. In command of the regiment was Robert Gould Shaw, a colonel at the ripe old age of 26 of the Boston Goulds and Shaws.Played by Matthew Broderick in what could be his career role on screen, Shaw's character serves as narrator of the events. He was quite the letter writer and his correspondence to his parents and friends in the Boston area have been considered a valuable piece of original historical material and are preserved at the Harvard Library.Shaw was a fervent believer in not only the abolitionist cause, but a firm believer in racial equality, many were not even in the army that was fighting for slave freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation. He fought hard for his troops, for their rations and supplies, against quartermasters who thought it was a fun thing to short change them.His good friend from the same Boston crowd Shaw came from was his second in command, Cabot Forbes played by Cary Elwes. They've got their differences as well, but both are committed to a cause.Shaw's black regiment comes in all shapes and sizes as well. Denzel Washington won his first Academy Award as a rather undisciplined soldier who eventually proves his worth on the battle field. Morgan Freeman is an older man who rapidly rises to leadership ranks because of his concern for the unit as a whole. My favorite performance in the film however is that of Andre Braugher. He plays a free black man from Massachusetts who grew up with Shaw and can read and write, a rare thing for black Americans free or slave in Civil War era America. In the south it was a crime to educate slaves beyond what they needed to know to perform their labors. He comes from a different perspective than the runaway slaves have and he's not at first accepted as a comrade among them, especially by Washington. Braugher shows he has the right stuff though and he should have been recognized with an Oscar nomination in my humble opinion.In addition to Denzel Washington's Oscar, Glory took home gold for Sound and for Cinematography in 1989 and was nominated for Editing and for Art&Set Direction. The film has the look and feel of the Civil War era about it. It took a long time for the heroic story of the 54th Massachusetts and its leader to come to the screen. Both are shown to have had the right stuff. The tens of thousands who died in the Civil War and those for whom the war was all about and died at Fort Wagner gave what Lincoln called, 'the last full measure of devotion'. And this film is a tribute to them.",Glory
2,Leofwine_draca,Character-led war action from an underrated director,6,10 November 2016,"I can't say that there are a great many films about the American Civil War out there. If there are, I haven't seen them and I don't know of them. Perhaps it's a war that doesn't do very well at the box office or one which people prefer to forget. However, Edward Zwick's GLORY is an exception to that general rule, and it's a decent war film to boot.The story is of the war's first black regiment led by a young and inexperienced white officer. Inevitably it has the ring of truth to it and that's because what happened was entirely true. Forget George Lucas and his RED TAILS pandering, though; this is a grittily realistic story about honour, death, and the extent of human endurance. Zwick has some affinity with the war-film genre having more recently made the excellent THE LAST SAMURAI and DEFIANCE, and I'd wish he'd concentrate more on the genre instead of wasting his time with romance and the like.GLORY is an actor's film featuring a wealth of black talent whether it be Morgan Freeman or Denzel Washington, who burns up the screen in a star-making turn. Andre Braugher, who you might remember from THE MIST, has a fine role as a bookish recruit. The one weak link I thought was Matthew Broderick, but his character and acting style did grow on me a little as the story progresses and I was able to overcome my dislike of the actor to enjoy his performance. It was nice to see Cary Elwes as something other than the young and annoying hero character of THE PRINCESS BRIDE. The battle scenes aren't the most gruesome or realistic of the genre (aside from an early moment) but the use of orchestral music and Zwick's direction makes them very good, and the climactic fighting is undeniably stirring.",Glory
3,SnoopyStyle,Great glorious movie,9,29 October 2013,"Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) is the son of a wealthy Boston abolitionist family. He signs up for war at 23, and suffers through a harrowing battle at Antietam. After the ""victory"" at Antietam, the Union organizes the first company of black soldiers. Shaw would lead them into battle and history.The scale of the battles is impressive. It's a big production from director Edward Zwick. It is expertly put together. The acting is top rate from great actors. Broderick imparts a blend of hopefulness and pragmatism. He's a boy trying to live up to being a man with historic responsibilities. Morgan Freeman gives this movie weight, and Denzel Washington gives the big money shot.It's easy to nitpick this movie to death. By quoting directly from Shaw's letters, it lends itself to criticism of its factual reliability. But that would miss the point of the movie. It's not a documentary.",Glory
4,kosmasp,Beyond Glory,10,21 June 2020,"It's not like the real people that this movie is paying homage to, where thinking back then, that there was any Glory in what they did. Actually the movie makes it pretty clear that many did not even want to be there. It also makes it clear that while fighting side by side, in no way blacks and whites were equal. Not just payment wise, but in many other ways.Expendable you say? I hear you, they couldn't back then. Matthew is a laid back person as Zwick the director confirms. I think anyone can tell, so it is even more amazing how he transforms at certain moments and plays ""hard"" and mean in the movie. It is imperative, not just as character moments, but also the journey of the movie and himself.And then there is Denzel Washington. Do I have to say more? Mesmerizing as one can imagine and as one would think he is. Incredible performance by him - but also by all the other actors involved. A great movie about a certain, possibly, war defining moment ...",Glory
5,classicsoncall,"""We ran away slaves, but we come back fightin' men"".",8,16 October 2011,"Civil War re-enactments are some of the most insane things I've ever seen. Men line up in formation on opposing sides, and shoot at each other in wide open fields with no cover or protection. I have no idea why battles like this were ever deemed to be practical in the first place. I would think fighting guerrilla style would have a lot more merit if your objective is to actually kill the enemy and win without getting killed yourself.Aside from whatever historical inaccuracies might be present, I thought this was an effective story. Criticisms of Matthew Broderick in the lead role are somewhat misplaced in my view, once one gets past the fact that he's Matthew Broderick. About the same age as the character he portrays, I think he grows into the role of a Union Colonel over the course of the story, with each humanistic stand he takes for his troops showing the growth of his stature. The confrontation with the quartermaster was particularly impressive, while his bribery of General Harker (Bob Gunton) was instructive in the way leaders get their way when all reasonable attempts fail.Denzel Washington won his first Oscar in a break-out role here, but to my mind, any of his fellow actors could have been honored just as well. Morgan Freeman (Rawlins) and Andre Braugher (Thomas Searles) were equally impressive, and except for somewhat less screen time, Jihmi Kennedy (Sharts) was also quite effective. Colonel Shaw's mission was to turn this rag-tag band into an effective fighting regiment, and when he won them over by tearing up his own pay voucher, you knew that he had finally won their trust.What I admire about the film is the way it places in context the black man's struggle for freedom and identity, while showing how white men of courage and conviction helped achieve that goal. It's easy to decry a film as racist when it's telling a story about racism, and that's a beef I have with critics who are fixated on only one side of the story. Together, white and black men have been able to stand side by side over the course of history to right the wrongs of the past, and failure to recognize this is what stands in the way of a truly color blind society.",Glory
6,gavin6942,My Apathy Towards the Civil War Did Not Hinder My Viewing,8,19 August 2006,"I really don't want to give this film 8 of 10, but I must. And I'll explain why.My initial impression is that I don't care for Civil War films. And I think Cary Elwes, as much as I love him, was an odd casting choice. And Matthew Broderick in particular seemed odd. In ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", Broderick successfully played Ferris, who successfully played Abe Froman to get into a French restaurant. However, here Broderick played a spoiled rich kid, who was playing at being a colonel. But I was not finding it successful, I was waiting for the mustache to come off and Ferris to be revealed.Now, once I got over these things, I saw a great film. Morgan Freeman is always great. Denzel Washington was spectacular, especially during the whipping scene (which was quite emotional). The whole struggle of the ex-slaves was presented in a very moving way. (With the exception of one actor or character that seemed to be playing a very modern stereotype.) The story is of Robert Shaw, a real Civil War soldier, and his struggle to get the 54th (an almost all-black regiment) into battle and respected as equals. This is met with a series of successes and failures, as one might expect.I have nothing to say. It's a period piece. If you want to watch an emotional film about the war, check it out. Or even if you life human interest stories, you might find something inspiring in this movie (the war is actually more background than anything). I wasn't expecting to be wowed, but feel better for having this film in my life now. Maybe that means something to you.",Glory
7,lee_eisenberg,"watching the movie, I could tell what the criticism might be",8,15 April 2012,"This past weekend has mostly seen people remembering the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking, but the past year has been another anniversary: the Civil War. One of the best movies about that war is Edward Zwick's ""Glory"", about the first all-black regiment in the Union army. While I was watching it, I got the feeling that there might be criticism of the movie since the main focus is Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), who led the platoon into battle. Even so, the movie devotes ample time to the recruits and the discrimination that they face even from their own side. I found Trip (Denzel Washington) to be the most effective character in the movie, especially in the scene where he has his least pleasant experience.The point is that the movie does a great job showing how the 54th Regiment fought for what was probably the most important issue of the era, with fine performances from all cast members (who also include Morgan Freeman and Cary Elwes). Very much one that I recommend.",Glory
8,jboothmillard,Glory,7,16 October 2008,"From Golden Globe nominated director Edward Zwick (Legends of the Fall, Blood Diamond), this is a terrific war film that I mainly knew for the title, three of the actors, and the fact that one of them won an Oscar. Based on the letters of the lead character, Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) of the Federal Army during the American Civil War volunteered to lead the first company of black soldiers. In this company included Shaw's right hand, Maj. Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), Sgt. Maj. John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman), Pvt. Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy), and of course, Pvt. Trip (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Denzel Washington). Shaw was forced to deal with prejudices from both the enemy (who had orders to kill commanding officers of blacks), and of his own fellow officers. Also starring Andre Braugher as Cpl. Thomas Searles, John Finn as Sgt. Maj. Mulcahy, Donovan Leitch as Capt. Charles Fessenden Morse, John David Cullum as Henry Sturgis Russell, Alan North as Gov. John Albion Andrew, Cliff De Young as Col. James M. Montgomery, Bob Gunton as Gen. Charles Garrison Harker and Jane Alexander as Sarah Blake Sturgis Shaw. Broderick's performance may be slightly woody, but its still substantial, Freeman and Washington obviously have no problem proving themselves worthy actors, and Washington certainly deserved his Oscar. The battle scenes are all very watchable, and the premise of the film is very appealing to see the history of who was allowed to fight in future wars change. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score for James Horner and Best Screenplay. Denzel Washington was number 28, and Morgan Freeman number 27 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Washington was also number 40 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 68 on The 100 Greatest War Films, and it was number 31 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",Glory
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Heavy-Handed, Emotional War Story",5,27 September 2006,"Here's another one of those films I really, really liked on the first go-round and was very disappointed on the second look years later. Maybe, by the second viewing after I had watched thousands of movies since first seeing this, I just got tired of the ""race issue."" Yeah, I am sure black people had to get treated with little respect back in the Civil War days, as well as many other days until recent decades, but I don't need to be shown the evil white man for two straight hours. We get the point earlier on and it doesn't need to hammered over and over and over. Denzel Washington, as great an actor as he is, seems to specialize in race-issue movies. He and Spike Lee need to move on. In this movie, every Caucasion but one (played by Matthew Broderick) is a racist bad-guy. Enough said.The action scenes in here are good. The last one is brutal and memorable. This is a tough film in many spots and will leave you emotionally worn out by the end. And - yes - it is a great tribute to the black soldiers in the Civil War.",Glory
10,rmax304823,Overall fine; in detail flawed.,6,23 February 2007,"There were complaints that Mathew Broderick was too short and unimposing to play Robert Gould Shaw, the Colonel who led the 54th Massachussetts into battle and dismemberment. I don't think I agree. Why should a courageous and even heroic man be made to look like Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses? Weren't there ever any SHORT heroes? As far as I can discern, from what little grasp of historical events I have, the general outline of the plot sticks pretty close to the facts. I don't know that Frederick Douglass was still as prominent in 1863 as he had been earlier. Maybe he was. As the events unfold, though, they ring fairly true. The narration by Broderick is lifted directly from Shaw's letters to his family and they reveal a self-doubt, a contrarian conviction, a dignity, an objectivity, and a humility that all the rest of us must envy. His role in the film is similar to that of Liam Neeson's in ""Schindler's List"" or Richard Harris's in ""A Man Called Horse"" or Kevin Costner's in ""Dances With Wolves."" He is ""our"" liaison to ""them"". Shaw was educated, white, and socially prominent so we get to know a lot about him and the milieu in which he was raised. The Colored Troops, as they were called at the time, are only sketched in by the writers, and only sketchily sketched. There is the angry ex-slave, the wise old man, the good-natured but dumb squirrel shooter, and the poetry-reading New Englander who gets the crap beaten out of him by a racist Mick Sergeant -- for a lofty cause, naturally, as all sadistic drill sergeants are quick to point out. They look a little too much like the crew of the original Memphis Belle. If they were white, there would be a street-wise tough guy from Brooklyn and a braggart farm boy from Texas. The stereotypes are functional, though. Most stereotypes are.The structure shows us that not all ""blacks"" were the same. Nor were all ""Northern whites"" the same. Cliff DeYoung is a Jayhawker, an ex-slave owner, now an abolitionist, who believes his men must be treated like children. There was a lot of that going around. Darwinism was still a radical idea, less than ten years old. Nobody had the slightest idea of how humans had evolved and in the absence of DNA and other biological evidence of racial relationships, judgments were made on the basis of traits that have been shown to be superficial -- hair texture, skin color, the shape of the soft parts of the face. African-Americans were easy targets for displaced aggression just because they looked so different and there were so many of them around. Irishmen stepping off the boats were faced with being drafted into what was thought (wrongly) to be a rich man's war and a poor man's fight. The draft riots of New York City killed more than a hundred people, most of them black, including some in an orphanage.There were some monumental historical dynamics at work at the time, but no space to go into them, and they're most irrelevant to the movie anyway. (May I suggest reading Bruce Catton's books on the Civil War? Or MacPherson's Pulitzer-Prize-winning ""The Battle Cry of Freedom""?) Broderick does pretty well by his role. He toughens up as he goes along. Cary Elwes looks handsome and acts as a humanistic counterbalance. Among the troops, Morgan Freeman is excellent, as usual, though his part doesn't offer him that much to do. What a fine actor he is. And Andre Braugher as the educated New Englander who is a poor soldier is outstanding as well. Denzel Washington was adequate without bringing much else to the party. The score is so bloated with ""glory"" that it really belongs to some epic about The Second Coming.Perhaps the scene I found most amusing involved Braugher and the rest debarking in South Carolina and bumping into some local ex-slaves. Braugher is unable to understand them because they're speaking in Gullah dialect, in which a ""buckra man"" is a boss or, by extension, any white person. The most disturbing scene involved my watching this in a theater in which the audience was largely black and being almost deafened by screams of exhortation as the Colored Troops shot and bayoneted whites. I wonder if Gunnar Myrdal may have been right about race in this country.",Glory
11,ma-cortes,Impressive and moving Civil War movie with long-standing and emotive score by James Horner,9,25 March 2012,"Classic Civil War film with an interesting screenplay written by Kevin Jarre , based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, and the novel Lay This Laurel, by Lincoln Kirstein . Robert Gould Shaw leads the US Civil War's first all-black volunteer company, fighting prejudices of both his own Union army and the Confederates . The story is based on the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first formal unit of the US Army to be made up entirely of African American men, as told from the point of view of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) , its commanding officer during the American Civil War. Captain Robert Gould Shaw leads a company of Union soldiers from a Massachusetts Infantry Regiment in an attack on Confederate troops at the Battle of Antietam, on September 17, 1862. His regiment suffers heavy losses, Shaw is wounded, and later loses consciousness. He is awakened by a black gravedigger named John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and sent to a field hospital. While receiving medical attention, Shaw is told that President Lincoln is on the verge of passing the Emancipation Proclamation; freeing slaves in rebel held territory. While on leave in Boston, Shaw is promoted to Colonel, and given command of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first all-black regiment . Shaw was approached by his father (Peter Michael Goetz) while in camp in late 1862 to take command of a new All-Black Regiment and writes a letter her mother (Jane Alexander) . He accepts the assignment , and asks his friend , Cabot Forbes (Gary Elwes), to be his second-in-command . At first he declined the offer, but after careful thought he accepted the position. Shaw's letters clearly state that he was dubious about a free black unit succeeding, but the dedication of his men deeply impressed him, and he grew to respect them as fine soldiers. On learning that black soldiers would receive less pay than white ones, he inspired his unit to conduct a boycott until this inequality was rectified . Their first volunteer soldier is another of Shaw's friends, an educated black man named Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher). Later on , join other African-American soldiers (an utter all-star-cast : Morgan Freeman , Denzel Washington) and a tough Sergeant Major Mulcahy (John Finn). At the ending , Shaw volunteers the 54th infantry to lead an assault on Fort Wagner. After nightfall, he leads the men in a charge upon the fort. Numerous soldiers in the regiment charge up the parapet and die in the fighting too .This wonderful film with an enormous attention to period detail is full of thrills , with battle scenes are truly breathtaking , historical events and moving scenes . Intelligent in its storytelling drama , it turns to be a thought-provoking and powerful story with several emotive moments . The picture's strength belongs to the powerhouse secondary casting with top-notch performances from Morgan Freeman , Andre Braugher , Jihmi Kennedy , Cliff De Young , Bob Gunton , Richard Rhiele , Donovan Leitch among others . Epic and stirring final battle carried out by Shaw volunteers the 54th infantry to lead an assault on Fort Wagner . Colorful cinematography by the British Freddie Francis , a magnificent cameraman and also filmmaker . Special mention to the marvelous soundtrack, composed by James Horner in conjunction with the Boys Choir of Harlem , one of the best of the cinema's history . Lavishly produced by TriStar and stunningly directed by Edward Zwick .The film deservedly received Academy Award nominations for Best Editing and Best Art Direction. It won a number of awards from the British Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. Denzel Washington won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his splendid portrayal of Trip , the proud and upright soldier . Rating : Above average , two thumbs up , it's long overdue and moving tribute to the African-American soldiers who fought for the Union cause in the Civil War . This is an admirable effort with true social significance that results to be surprisingly entertaining.",Glory
12,paul_haakonsen,"A strong, emotional historical drama...",8,9 June 2019,"""Glory"" from 1989 is definitely a classic within the American civil war genre, right up alongside with ""Gettysburg"".I just finished watching ""Glory"" for the third time since it was initially released, and the movie still manages to captivate and entertain me as much as it did the first time I sat down to watch it on VHS. For me, while I am not American, then there is just something fascinating and interesting about the American civil war and that whole era.This is by no means an all-out-action movie set in the American civil war. No sir. This is more of a drama with elements of action thrown into it. And of course it is also heavy on the historical and documentary aspects. And director Edward Zwick really was making one amazing movie here, based on the writings of Kevin Jarre (doing the screenplay), Lincoln Kirstein and Peter Burchard (writing the book) and of course Robert Gould Shaw (whom wrote the original letters).The build up of the movie is very riveting and captivating, and director Edward Zwick manages to put something on the screen that makes the audience feel like they are right there alongside with the Union soldiers of the 54th. There is a nice progression to the story, right up to the fatal assault on Fort Wagner.Not only does ""Glory"" have a very entertaining storyline to tell, but the movie also have a lot of great actors on the cast list. First and foremost, you have a young Matthew Broderick in the lead. Now, I remember thinking that Broderick would never be up for such a task, given his comedy movies and such, back when I first saw ""Glory"". But wow, this movie definitely proves that Matthew Broderick is a skilled actor, and it is a wonder why ""Glory"" is not the movie his name is associated with in comparison to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". Then there are also the likes of Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, Morgan Freeman and Andre Braugher, whom all stood out prominently in the movie with ther individual performances.""Glory"" is a must watch movie if you have an interest in the American civil war and the historical events that took place during that era. Not only is it an entertaining movie, but it is also educational as well. This is definitely a classic movie. And if you haven't already seen this movie, then you need to do yourself a favor and jump at the chance if you get the chance to do so.",Glory
13,BandSAboutMovies,Freddie Francis!,6,28 September 2020,"Yeah, we sometimes watch movies that win actual awards and are seen as substantial pieces of art. You can bet your sweet bippy that Sam has nothing to do with the selection of those movies, as he often says things like, ""You know, I'd like to watch Human Lanterns,"" and Becca just rolls her eyes.The spoonful of sugar that helped the medicine go down? This movie's cinematographer is Freddie Francis. Yes, the very same person who directed Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, Torture Garden, Tales from the Crypt and Son of Dracula. Before he made any of those movies, Francis had already won an Oscar for 1960's Sons and Lovers. He won major acclaim for being the cinematographer for The Elephant Man, Dune, Cape Fear and this movie, which he won an Oscar for in 1989.Based on the books Lay This Laurel by Lincoln Kirstein and One Gallant Rush by Peter Burchard, as well as the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (who is played in the movie by Matthew Broderick), this is the story of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, the Union Army's first African-American regiment in the American Civil War.While Glory was the first major motion picture to tell the story of black U.S. soldiers fighting for their freedom from slavery during the Civil War and even has Shelby Foote - who was a major part of Ken Burns' The Civil War - as a technical advisor, it still takes massive liberties with history. For example, a major scene has Private Trip (Denzel Washington) being flogged for running away, a punishment that was stopped two years before when this movie takes place. The reason behind his insubordination - the lack of shoes for the black soldiers - was also untrue, as on the day the recruits arrived at Readville (way after Christmas 1862, so that's wrong) they were given new uniforms and boots. There are many more issues - the direction of the actual attack, the fact that most of the 54th were free men and not slaves, the fact that Fort Wagner really was taken over by Union forces in 1863 and that General Charles Garrison Harker never served around Charleston - but why let them get in the way of the story?There's a great quote from Roger Ebert about this movie: ""Watching Glory, I had one recurring problem. I didn't understand why it had to be told so often from the point of view of the 54th's white commanding officer. Why did we see the black troops through his eyes - instead of seeing him through theirs? To put it another way, why does the top billing in this movie go to a white actor?""I feel that if this movie had been made in 2020 and not 1989, it would be a completely different story.That said, Morgan Freeman is great as Sergeant Major John Rawlins. It's still an important movie, if you're aware of the historical changes. What has not changed is that the Civil War was fought for many reasons, but the fact that we could be all equal has always been the lesson that I've taken. I rarely get political in my writing here - how can I when mostly I discuss Shaw Brothers, Turkish ripoffs and Mexican pro wrestling movies - but make no mistake, anyone that flies a rebel flag today is the most baseless moron there can be.",Glory
14,hitchcockthelegend,And there wouldn't be nothing but rebs dyin if they'd let the fifty-fourth in it.,10,7 June 2008,"Based around the actual letters sent by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw to his parents, this Civil War picture tells the story of the Massachusetts 54th Regiment, the first black regiment to fight under the American flag. Led by their white leader (Shaw), they must overcome bigotry, in fighting and the war itself, and this just to feel like men of honour.The most striking thing about Glory is that it is never over sentimental. With the subject to hand it would have been easy for the makers to over egg the pudding and rely solely on a racialist stance purely for impact. What we do get is actually a candidate for one of the most politically correct war films to have ever been made. It's harsh and at times heart tugging, that in fact is certainly true, but the narrative never veers from the core essence of men wanting to be just that - men!Director Edward Zwick has many critics in the industry, but here his attention to detail should be roundly applauded. He perfectly captures the period whilst molding a tightly plotted piece of work. Zwick also needs a pat on the back for hiring cinematographer Freddie Francis (Academy Award Winner), who weaves his magic to bring the brutality of the surroundings vividly to life. While James Horner provides a wonderful swirling emotive score (fans of his work on Braveheart should definitely check out this earlier composition). Though the film is essentially a multi ensemble piece, there are tremendous performances from the principal actors. Matthew Broderick (Shaw), Denzel Washington (Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actor) (Trip), Morgan Freeman (John Rawlins) and Andre Braugher (Searles).We follow this regiment from their initial formation, here they are ill equipped and never taken seriously, it appears that this army is not even worthy of being canon fodder. But through sheer determination - and led by the empathetically driven Shaw, the 54th Regiment prove themselves to be a worthy fighting force. This ultimately leads to their place in American history with the culmination of events at South Carolina's Fort Wagner (a stunning emotive finale that booms out of the screen).Heroic and tragic is the tale of Glory, but the chief point of enlightenment through historical facts, and the message of heroics having no colour, makes Glory a truly inspiring movie that demands to be seen and totally respected. 10/10",Glory
15,Theo Robertson,A 19th Century Story Told In A 20th Century Manner,6,21 August 2013,"I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was "" Hollywood History "" complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility",Glory
16,Doylenf,Powerful and emotional Civil War story with great ensemble cast...,8,17 February 2012,"James Horner's music fills much of the background to give GLORY the kind of emotional level it reaches in telling the story of a group of Negroes who choose to join a ragged regiment headed by a young white man (Matthew Broderick)in the Civil War. Abetted by Horner's effective use of music and chorals in the background, as well as some of the best ensemble casts ever assembled, GLORY is a uniquely satisfying blend of war and humanity. As a film it's a gem.The blatant bias that exists between black and white soldiers is on display throughout, gradually tempered by the realization that the ragged regiment has become a family during arduous training. Denzel Washington as a bigoted black soldier was justly rewarded with a Golden Globe and an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Other around him are equally valid, including Morgan Freeman and Cary Elwes. Broderick does a fine job in the central role of the young commander who gradually matures in the course of the battles and in his firm command of the troop.An aspect of the Civil War seldom shown is the participation of many blacks on the firing line. Both action scenes and intimate emotional tugs of war are blended seamlessly and makes for gripping and raw emotional moments.Based on a true story, it's highly recommended for expert acting and an eloquent script that benefits from fine direction.",Glory
17,LeonLouisRicci,Discovering a Universal Truth...All Men are Equally Men,8,29 May 2013,"The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The ""fight"" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will.At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others.This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes.But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called ""The Better Angels of Our Nature"".

Formed during the American Cicil War, the 54th Massachusetts was the first African-American unit in the US Army. We see the formation of the regiment, its first volunteers, their training, disputes with administrators, their first operations in South Carolina and, finally, their moment of glory - the attack on Fort Wagner.Incredibly moving movie. The regiment is historical for its formation, for its attack on Fort Wagner and for how, through their courage, the regiment inspired many other African-Americans to enlist in the Union army, to the extent that about 180,000 African- Americans fought for the Union in the Civil War. We see the issues they had to go through, facing racial prejudice at every turn. We also get to feel how their existence symbolizes why the war was being fought, and what's at stake if the Union loses. A quite necessary movie, for the above reason and to show the part African-Americans played in the Civil War. Plus it conveys a strong tolerance and anti-racism message.Solid performance by Matthew Broderick in the lead role. Denzel Washington gives the stand-out performance, as Private Trip. He got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his efforts.Good support too from Morgan Freeman and Cary Elwes.",Glory

""Glory"", largely based upon the book ""Lay this Laurel"", is about the 54th Massachusetts regiment during the Civil War which was made up of black soldiers. The movie picks up sometime in 1862 with the war already going on. Not long into the movie the idea is proposed and adopted to incorporate black soldiers. They were very willing but very raw. Many of them were runaway slaves and didn't know the first thing about army life or fighting in a war. It's both a heartwarming and heart-wrenching story that should be a source of pride for any African-American and even any American. It is a very patriotic story about men that wanted to fight for what every American cherishes: freedom. It just so happens that they had to fight for the Union Army to gain that freedom.",Glory

I wasn't engaged in the narrative & the lethargic pacing got to me after a point. Kevin Jarre's Adapted Screenplay isn't powerful enough. I loved some scenes in its second-hour, but overall, I found the goings-on to be mostly dull. Better Writing was most definitely needed! Zwick's Direction is satisfactory.The Late/Great Freddie Francis's Cinematography is mesmerizing. 'Glory' is a visual delight, no two options on that! Another ace is Denzel Washington's Oscar-Winning sterling performance. As Private Silas Trip, Washington enacts the tormented soul with unmatchable ease.

24,JamesHitchcock,A Message the World Needed to Hear,9,28 September 2020,"The traditional American war film went into a decline in the late seventies and eighties, and this decline has been linked to a loss of national self-confidence following the twin traumas of Watergate and Vietnam. (Sam Fuller's ""The Big Red One"" is a rare example from the period). Even the re-emergence of American patriotism during the Reagan era did not do much to revive the genre. When David Puttnam's ""Memphis Belle"" came out in 1990, the critics all said how old-fashioned it seemed.""Glory"", however, is that rare thing, a 1980s war film which deals with its subject in a patriotic rather than a pacifist manner and which treats American soldiers as heroes fighting for their country. The twist is that the film is set not in World War II but in the Civil War and the drama is centred upon the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, the Union Army's first black regiment, and upon its commanding officer, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. It is therefore a film which is as much about racism as it is about war.During the Civil War black Americans living in the Northern states may have been free in the sense that they were not slaves, but this does not mean that they were equal with whites. The decision to allow blacks to serve in the Army was only taken reluctantly because manpower was desperately needed, and all the 54th's commissioned officers, and at first all the NCOs, were white. (When Gould promotes a black soldier to Sergeant-Major this causes resentment among white troops). It is implied that Gould, a very young officer who previously only held the rank of Captain, would not have been appointed to command a white regiment.At first it is intended that the 54th should only be used for manual labour behind the lines, but Gould, who takes pride in his men's professionalism and courage, insists that they are capable of taking on the enemy in armed combat. He finds that he constantly needs to defend them against ill-treatment by the Army authorities (they are paid less than their white counterparts) and against the attacks of other Union officers, particularly a pro-Union Southerner who hates blacks and ""Seceshes"" (secessionists) with an equal passion.This is one of those films which contain so many fine performances that it is not possible to mention them all. Special mention must go to Matthew Broderick as the idealistic young Gould, Morgan Freeman as Sergeant Major John Rawlins, Denzel Washington in an Oscar-Winning performance as Private Trip who is cynical about fighting in what he sees as a white man's war, and Andre Braugher as Thomas Searles, a bookish intellectual who before the war was a close friend of Gould but because he is black has to serve in the ranks whereas Gould is part of the officer class.
Gould was a real historical figure, whereas all the black characters in the film are fictitious, and because his is the leading role some in recent years have disparaged this as a ""white saviour"" narrative. That is not, however, a criticism I remember anyone making in 1989 and it is one that strikes me as misguided because the film shows that black Americans were not just passive victims of injustice waiting for liberal-minded whites to set them free. That African-Americans did not play a greater part in the Northern war effort was due to the prejudices of the white establishment than to any lack of enthusiasm on their part.The film's climax comes when the 54th are finally allowed to see active service and are ordered to take part in an assault on the Confederate stronghold of Fort Wagner. They fight bravely, but the attack fails and many members of the regiment, including Gould, are killed. One of the last shots shows the Confederate flag still waving above the ramparts. This ending reminded me of that of another great war film, ""The Great Escape"". That film too ended in apparent failure; most of the escapers did not succeed in reaching freedom, and many of them were killed. Yet the message of both films is that apparent failure can be a success in its own terms if the courage and determination of those involved inspire others to take up a just cause. That may have been a less fashionable message in the eighties than it had been in 1963, but it is one that the world needed to hear. 9/10",Glory

26,DKosty123,A True Memorial For Civil War Drama,7,29 May 2016,"In a lot of ways, this movie which preceded Ken Burns The Civil War is a part of what inspired it. This film kind of set a new story to the American Civil War few had seen. The consulting on this included Shelby Foote who was a fairly large part of the Burns series to follow.Historical accuracy might be impossible to prove. Foote's expert consult helps but that does assure it. The cast brings this off very well with Kudos to Mathew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman. The story is a small little know piece of Civil War History. The reason it is so obscure is the lack of involvement of the biggest major heroes of the war.In a war where over 400,000 Americans died, there are a lot of those corners. It is tough to say this, but every hero in the Civil War is not told, because some of them are lost to history and beyond the reach of anyone now, it has been so many years. James Horner's music here, years before Titanic, is very recognizable and adds to the drama. The final battle sequence is very much in the mood of Titanic, even to the sequence after the battle where the bodies are being laid to rest. The drama of this story is definitely enhanced by the mood this music sets here.Time passing has made this film better. So many of the reasons the film is what it is are now gone. It is a testament to why we need to record the moments we can, while we can. Life only happens once. How people contribute is the real Glory, such as in this story here.",Glory

I finally saw this film in its entirety in a high school history class, and I remembered it to be very powerful, dark and depressing - upsetting feelings of despair and dismal only war could bring.It's a pretty suspenseful and intriguing story about Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) commanding the US Civil War's first black volunteer company to battle the Union army and the Confederates. Broderick, known for his more comedic roles, had me taken-aback with his serious and daunting performance, especially the part where he kept yelling at Denzel Washington's character while shooting his gun in the air. I don't remember much of anything else in this film, except that there are a lot of gun battles and bloodshed, things you would except in a war movie.I'd say it is on par with Saving Private Ryan as far as suspense, disturbance and emotional materials are concerned.Grade B-",Glory
28,sddavis63,Superb Civil War Movie That Everyone Should See,10,30 October 2001,"I have watched ""Glory"" many times since it first appeared in 1989, and was still thrilled to see that it was being aired again last night. I could watch this movie over and over again and never tire of it.From the graphic depiction of the Battle of Antietam that open the movie, to the graphic depiction of the Battle of Fort Wagner that closes it, this must surely rate as one of the best war movies ever. The battle scenes are meticulously recreated, the acting is absolutely brilliant and the drama compelling throughout. The 54th Massachussetts, of course, was the first all black regiment (except for the white officers who commanded it) in the history of the US Army. And this is its story - movingly told by director Edward Zwick, from the book by Lincoln Kirstein. The performances are outstanding. One hates to name anyone, because where does one start, but special mention has to be made of Matthew Broderick. As I recall, having made his name in Hollywood playing Ferris Bueller, he was something of a controversial choice for the part of the young Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. But he pulls the part off with ease. He plays Shaw quite appropriately as nervous and uncertain - promoted well ahead of his time - and having a need to be perhaps overly tough on the troops to prove his leadership. But Broderick also brings out the essential humanness of the man, his commitment to the abolitionist cause and his desire to demonstrate that his black soldiers were every bit as good as the best white soldiers the army had. Then there was Morgan Freeman as Sgt. Rollins, Denzel Washington as the angry Tripp, Jihmi Kennedy as the nervous but committed Jupiter, Andre Braugher as the educated Thomas Searles (who has his own struggle to fit in with a ragtag group of runaway slaves), Cary Elwes as Cabot Forbes, Shaw's friend and second in command. This was a true ensemble cast that worked together perfectly.Never was there a more moving scene in any movie I have seen that Col. Shaw reading the Proclamation of the Confederate Congress to his men (that all blacks captured would be returned to slavery, that any blacks captured in federal uniform would be executed and that any white officers commanding black troops would be executed) and then emerging from his tent the next morning to see if any were left (literally, as the movie depicts - and probably accurately - expecting most to be gone.)There have been some criticisms of this movie as being not 100% historically accurate (particularly the depiction of the 54th Massachussetts as being mostly ex-slaves, which apparently it was not) but to me that's just carping for the sake of wanting to find something to criticize. This is brilliant. Any student of the Civil War must watch this.It's a 10/10.",Glory
29,ElMaruecan82,The 'real' Birth of a Nation ...,9,7 August 2013,"Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous ""Birth of a Nation"", a film like ""Glory"" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. ,""Glory"" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as ""Do the Right Thing"" or ""Driving Miss Daisy"" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role.There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of ""Glory"", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause.Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and ""Glory"", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees.And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot.Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting.But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that ""Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites"". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of ""The Birth of a Nation"" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race.It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in ""Glory"": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.",Glory
30,paul2001sw-1,Glorification and simplicity,5,18 October 2008,"The American civil war was fought against slavery, but specifically because northern businessmen feared the hegemony of their slave-owning southern counterparts; Lincoln's conversion to the doctrine of universal human rights was an emergent, and controversial, feature of the conflict. A drama about the first black regiment to fight in the war is therefore potentially rife with intriguing ambiguity; unfortunately, 'Glory' prefers to portray the regiment (and it's saintly white commander) as straightforward heroes, and the drama proceeds without much subtlety. The soundtrack in the closing sections, with its choral overtones, is used to underscore the simplistic take home message; while the acting and writing has a two-dimensional quality throughout.

33,ironhorse_iv,Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! This is truly one of the best movies ever made about the American Civil War. It will continue to march on.,8,4 July 2020,"Glory be! This motion picture directed by Edward Zwick was a splendid achievement of cinema. It was well made. Based off the historical accounts from 1965 novel 'One Gallant Rush' by Peter Burchard & 1973 novel 'Lay This Laurel' by Lincoln Kirstein. The film written by Kevin Jarre depicts the soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts African-American regiment under the command of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) from the formation of their unit to their heroic actions at the Second Battle of Fort Wagner. Without spoiling the movie too much, despite the fact the majority of its supporting characters were fictional such as Corporal Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher) and Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes). Each of them do represented the archetypes of the real people of the regiment so well. While a lot of people like Denzel Washington as Private Silas Trip and so do I. There is a part of me that felt that his character was a bit out of place with his modern-day use of an offensive racist term, the street angst language and attitude that came with it. It seems like Washington was channeling the anti-establishment feelings of black men in the late 20th century rather than the ones that went through harsh realities of slavery during that time period. Nevertheless, he still deserves his win for best supporting actor at the 62th Academy Awards. And no, it's not because of the gruesome flogging scene which in reality could had been avoid if the characters involve spoke to each other in clear communication. It's for the very good two interaction with Morgan Freeman's character of Sgt Mgt. John Rawlings during a campfire. Morgan Freeman was amazing. His speech about wanting to fight and confronting Trip was really powerful. Matthew Broderick not so much. He didn't connect with anybody. He also isn't really the intimidating commanding type. Nor did Broderick couldn't really deliver with showing emotion with Shaw's PTSD subplot. To add onto that Broderick did momentarily forget his lines at certain scenes. At least he tried. Sad that he and Elwes wouldn't get along. Lots of their scenes were cut. Still the movie could had done a little better by establishing more actors playing real life people into the unit like Fredrick Douglass' sons Lewis & Charles. It would add more stakes to the conflict. Another person worthy to be in the movie would had been Sergeant William Harvey Carney whom was awarded the Medal of Honor during the course of the war. Yes, I get that most of these men were living freely in the North when the war started but the impression that the film tells with most of the 54th being escaped slaves was a little inaccurate. The 1st Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry Regiment was more like that. To add onto that, they were also the first African American regiment in the Union despite what this film is telling. They as well were the first to see combat in late 1862. The 54th didn't start training until early 1863 because the governor of Massachusetts wanted them to be an elite unit that can read and write. Because of that, most of the men of the 54th were educated in real life unlike this film. Nevertheless, the film certainly doesn't sugarcoat the challenges that the men had to go throughout the war, both in battle and at home. While the flogging scene never happen in real life due to the practice being abolished by the U.S Army in 1861. They still dealt with some racism. Not to the extreme like reduced to marching barefoot in cold mud as the film depicts, but for example with the pay. That part did happen and a boycott did follow, but in real life it was led by the commander rather than the soldiers. Despite that, I do like how the movie didn't go too far into the white savior narrative. However, I do feel that the addition of voice over reading from the real letters to Shaw was a little too much. Show. Don't tell. Regardless I did like how the movie show the Battle of Antietam, Grimball's Landing and Fort Wagner with diehard civil war reenactors who did the film voluntarily and without pay. They really put a lot of work into the reenactments especially the ending. Despite a few changes like not showing General George Crockett Strong (Jay O Sanders) joining them in the raid on the beach fort, Shaw volunteering to lift the flag and the actual attack occurred from the opposite direction with the ocean on their right parallel to the regiment. It was still a great way to end the film. Bittersweet.
While the film's closing statement says that the Confederate fort was never taken by Union forces which is technically true. It was finally occupied by the Union in September 1863 after the fort was abandoned. Another thing, while there isn't a lot of gore in the battle scenes. The movie doesn't play the action safe and all whimsical romantic PG. It does shows how chaotic brutal and bloody the violence can get with its R rating. The profanity is much the same. It's used sparingly and wasn't overwhelming. Composer James Horner's score not so much. The whimsical patriotic tone did feel a little forced. Regardless, it's beautiful to listen to. Overall: There are tons of powerful scenes in this movie that can related to today's world especially in 2020 such as slicing up watermelons to destroy the negative stereotypes of black people, showing why looting & property damage can only lead to fueling more hate and the debate for or against nation pride with Trip wondering if he should bear the flag or not because of what the future might or not bring.

From the point of view of a young Officer, Captain Shaw of the Massachusetts contingency to the Army of the Potomac. We soon learn from conversations and from his letters sent back to his folks, that the young Captain is from a wealthy family, well educated and has connections, politically speaking.AFTER RECEIVING A WOUND forged in battle, Shaw is furloughed home in order to convalesce. It is during this period that he becomes aware that the Commonwealth has plans to raise a regiment of Black Soldiers, most of which will be comprised of fugitive slaves, run away from the Southern States. There are also free born Blacks; one of which, as portrayed by Andre Braugher, is also well educated and a friend of the now Colonel Shaw.FOLLOWING HIS FURLOUGH and recuperation period, the young Mr. Shaw is informed that the Regiment is his; although the rank and file troops will all be Blacks, the officers will be White.THEN BEGINS THE task of turning these men into a a fighting force; a job complicated mainly because of the the deprivation suffered by the former slaves. Marching is more difficult because many of the recruits aren't aware of the difference between their right and left feet.THE BASIC TRAINING is tough and the discipline is meted out in a not sparing the rod manner.The young infantrymen learn much of their combat techniques from guys like the hard-boiled, Mick Master Sergeant; whose demeanor was much the same as any Drill Instructor in subsequent wars in our history.AS HARD AS things were, the men of the 55th display a rare desire to succeed and to become real fighting men. Their eagerness wins out in the end; but is dampened by a reluctance by those in command to use Black Troops in combat. The early assignments have them in little better than uniformed looters and arsonists.THE AUTHOR AND the Director's use of the various characterizations of the men serves as a reminder that regardless of our inclusions in various races and ethnicities, we are all individuals. We are responsible for our actions and indeed, our lives as individuals.VARIOIUS PERSONALITIES OR ""TYPES"" are represented by the many, variously disposed personalities found in the roster of the unit. Hence we have the Educated Free Man (Andre Braugher), the streetwise,hardened Militant (Denzyl Washington), the Older and Wiser Veteran type (Morgan Freeman), etc.II IS THE words and actions of these and all the other players that the production team is able to speak to us and to the world about the need for just a little kindness and consideration for those around us. And the film never becomes neither preachy nor sophomoric; which would be a tendency that would be all too easy to descend to.ADDED TO ALL of the above is possibly the most brutally realistic depiction of infantry combat of that period. Never done for the sake of the gratuitous display of ""action"" or to liven up any scenes; it was none the proper and necessary to have such violence displayed in the film.IN THE FINAL analysis, one can only have one last statement about this Civil War Drama. That being, GLORY certainly does not glorify war.",Glory
35,poe426,Powerfully poignant...,10,16 July 2014,"It's impossible for me to watch this one without choking up again and again and again- and I've seen it half a dozen times. There aren't a lot of movies that are flawless, but, for me, this is one of them. It works so powerfully on an Emotional level that very little else matters- it's overwhelming. Matthew Broderick as the baby-faced Shaw is matched dramatic moment for dramatic moment by the likes of Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman and Andre Braugher and Cary Elwes- and the gut-wrenching score by James Horner drives home the point(s) further still. In its depiction of the utter INSANITY of War- we see men charging headlong at one another, all of them armed and determined to kill- it's about as accurate a reenactment as one could hope for. And all for what, finally? Nebulous notions of Nationality? Belief systems? Whatever the reason(s), many of those men (and women) believed that they were going on to an even greater GLORY.",Glory
36,johnnyboyz,"Zwick's nigh on, indeed, 'glorious' exploration of the setting up of a certain military company during The American Civil War often makes for involving viewing.",7,29 November 2010,"Glory begins by plunging us into the forefront of the American Civil War; a crash landing which sees a rather brutal battle sequence thrust upon us from the off which sticks with us. It provides us with what we presume to be a lead character; lingers on the aftermath of war and what it does to people physically, not shying away from anything, before plunging us again headlong into a separate battle unfolding within the realms of The Civil War; this one more related to people and a specific cause of fighting than the warfare itself. Edward Zwick's film is an affectionate retelling of a company of men, under white leadership, consisting entirely of black soldiers fighting for the Union Army in said conflict; an exploration amongst many things of identity further still within the company, and a respectful retelling of the true story of how ethical equality became apparent as whites and blacks fought together and died together on a level plain.Zwick casts, bravely given the time and the sorts of roles the actor was usually better known for, Matthew Broderick as the Union Army colonel named Robert Shaw; a sense of perspective, although deceptively so, established to revolve around this man as he leads his army's charge into battle against the Confederate Army – passing out in the process after garnering an injury and then having a confrontative sequence in a medical tent of another man's leg amputation shot from his point of view. The casting ends up being better than it has any right to be, an important scene seeing Broderick required to intimidate a recruit into reloading his rifle and firing it quicker than he's already doing so by way of firing off his own pistol a mere arm's length from the man's ear. The sense of Shaw being of this authoritarian ilk whom demands the best results possible, and is unashamed of getting them through whatever means, is evident here; if the casting of Broderick didn't work then this specific sequence would not have worked. Shaw is our anchor; his voice-overs updating us with precisely how he feels complete with angelic diary entries offering a definitive viewpoint from a higher-up, but it is around these things which the true tale of a group of people, indeed a race of people, is unfolded in a really engaging manner.Shaw's task, he being amongst the top in Union Army leaders, is to take charge of a new company of black troops which is being established following grossly affecting decisions by the higher-ups of the American government. It's through this later on that we come to realise there is no lead, merely a dramatic and informative retelling of how The Civil War affected race relations and had an impact on a nation's attitudes towards such a thing. The wider acceptance of this new division and the tasking of getting these new recruits into shape so as to be led into battle forms the greater extent of the picture, something Zwick executes with enough punch to save it from being some kind of equal rights lecture or melodramatic tale of being 'as-one'. But the trek is tough, and fraught with issues and difficulties; early on, the wider opinion of where it would seem many-a Union personnel stand on the issue of a Company of black soldiers arrives in the form of a racist trooper coming to the conclusion that ""it's better to go to war with a hog than a Negro"" for the reason that ""at least you can eat the hog"".What follows is a tough, gritty and thoroughly engaging march through the military system for the characters involved as one's worth is proved, climaxing in a charge into battle that sees everybody reading from the same page, regardless of colour, during which white soldiers and black soldiers surge into battle together; as established the previous night: their emotions and fears the same. For the first time in history, we feel, a sense of togetherness or being at one with one another's respective race as they partake in the same action; attempting to attain the same goals; feeling the same feelings. The principal soldiers of whom we follow in this new regiment are a certain Trip (Washington); another man named Jupiter Sharts (Kennedy); an ageing gravedigger named Rawlins (Freeman) and a more informed, more educated man named Searles (Braugher) who was the first to volunteer but finds the early Army life the toughest amongst everyone else. Their struggles are in direct comparison to that of Shaw and his own disagreements with his second in command; the drill Sergeant, whom is seems abuses the new recruits based on their race more than anything as well as those of a far higher disposition within the military whom it seems lend themselves towards corruption.Zwick's attention to character is equally immersing, at once the soldiers just wanting to know when it is they are permitted to attain ""the blue of the uniform"" before much later on having to question their own dedication to a cause that sees them pillage a village and partake in such gut-wrenching activity. The film's allowing of the black soldiers a voice or an identity in the uniform itself, before bringing things back so as to have them question this newfound state of identity bringing fresh, rich dynamics to what might have been a routine tale of how times changed during a famous war and attitudes merely shifted with them. In hindsight, and from what I've seen of Zwick's other work, his ability to tell a politically motivated story under a guise of half-decent adventure entertainment without being exploitative is evident in Africa's diamond trade and the threat of domesticised terrorism within the United States in 2006's Blood Diamond and 1998's The Siege respectively. Regardless of where you stand on those two, Glory somewhat impressively marking the beginnings of this ability he has to tackle such ideas in an engaging and accessible manner.",Glory

39,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A story of utmost importance, the well-crafted ""Glory"" tells of a whole other battle",9,28 May 2009,"War films seem to speak the loudest when ""the other side"" is not the actual enemy in the film. In ""Glory,"" based on the real letters of Union Col. Robert Gould Shaw of the Massachusetts 54th, America's first black regiment in the Civil War has to battle prejudice and its soldiers own devaluing of their personal worth. That is the enemy, and overcoming it is how they achieve ""glory"" on the battlefield.The film follows Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in his first dramatic leading role to which he finds a mild measure of success. Shaw survives Antietum when he asked by the Mass. governor and Frederick Douglass himself to lead the first black regiment. Not only is the racial barrier a thick one, but Shaw must battle his own uncertainties of being in command and how to deal with others of similar rank who abuse that power. When Shaw realizes his men are merely being used to do the labor of the army, he fights for their right to see battle -- essentially their dignity and glory.Broderick's style caters best to the softer, sympathetic sides of his character as well as the courageous moments, but as a commanding military presence, his performance comes up a bit flat. Still, he is supported by the tremendous talents of Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman. Washington breaks out in a huge way in this film as Pvt. Trip, a quick-tempered rabble-rouser who usually plays devil's advocate to the all the Civil Rights sentiments in the film, a role that earned him a best supporting Oscar. Freeman's performance as the more responsible, level-headed soldier is only overshadowed by the other film he released at the time, ""Driving Miss Daisy."" Also impressive are Cary Elwes of ""The Princess Bride"" as Maj. Forbes and John Finn as the loud Irish Sgt. Maj. Mulcahy.""Glory"" also lives up to its title in the way it is crafted. Director Edward Zwick fills this film with great visuals -- gun powder-shrouded fields, the Atlantic coastline at dusk and the flare-lit skies over Ft. Wagner in the film's final battle, all set to a majestic James Horner score. ""Glory"" might be Zwick's most Academy-recognized film (which he directed), but his films have most importantly continued to tell the untold stories of heroism all over the world in an entertaining and engaging way.The story is brilliantly crafted by making us feel good by showing people like Shaw breaking racial barriers a whole century before Civil Rights, but then fueling our emotions by introducing characters in power or situations where prejudice trumps this progressive and empowering movement of the story. The plot offers a diverse set of characters that result in a diverse set of responses and perspectives to the racial issues of the film -- from Cpl. Thomas Searles, a well-educated black man raised free in the North to the defeatist ""whites will always keep us down"" attitude of Washington's Pvt. Trip, ""Glory"" handles the race issue sensitively and smartly.The story of the 54th regiment is one that needed to be told and it's told extremely well by all who worked on ""Glory."" All the excellent craftsmanship of the film only enhances its wise approach to a war America still fights on its own soil to this very day: Civil Rights.",Glory
40,billcr12,Early Denzel,8,21 March 2012,"Matthew Broderick is Captain Robert Shaw in Glory, a film based on a true story of the Civil War. He is badly wounded in combat and is promoted to colonel. President Lincoln is about to free the slaves and Shaw is assigned an all black regiment of former slaves. They are given menial jobs to perform. Shaw discovers that his commanders are personally profiting from the war and threatens to turn them in unless they give his unit the opportunity to fight the confederate army. They first get a chance to fight the rebel troops in South Carolina successfully and so they move on to Fort Wagner where many are killed, including Colonel Shaw. Because of the bravery shown, history was forever changed as over 180,000 African Americans joined the Union army.Denzel Washington won an Academy Award for his role as Trip, a slave who has escaped to his freedom.

41,freemantle_uk,War film about race,8,19 July 2009,"Glory, the film that made the careers of a lot of people, Edward Zwick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman and Cary Elwes, and turned Matthew Broderick from a teen star to a movie star.Glory tells the story of the first all-black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, who fought in the American Civil War. This new regiment was set up by Massachusetts Governor John Andrew and black intelligent Frederick Douglass. It was both a PR stunt and a way to gain support of free Black slaves from the South. The commander of this new regiment was a young Captain who gets promoted to Colonel, Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick). He trains the black soldiers, he is tough, but he makes them into an effective unit. He doesn't have to battle the South because of racism within the officer corp of the Union Army. They prevent the Black troops getting supplies and refuse to let them fight on the front line. Shaw sets out to prove otherwise. With the regiment are Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), Shaw's friend who questions his harsh techniques. John Rawlins aka Gravedigger (Morgan Freeman), an older black soldier who acts a both a father figure to the soldiers and as the link between the soldiers and officers. Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), a intelligent free black man and a childhood friend of Shaw and Forbes, who finds army life tough. The pessimist of the group is Trip (Denzel Washington), an escaped slave who questions what the war is really about. Finally they is a Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy), a young stuttering soldier.Many of the characters have a strong backstory and have fine actors in the roles. This is easily the strongest performance I have ever seen by Matthew Broderick. He is at first seemingly weak and mis-casted but he grows into the role and is believable. Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman are both great actors, especially Freeman. Washington even won an Oscar (but personally I think it could have gone to Freeman as well). Andre Braugher was also a decent. I however found the character Sharts pretty annoying.There are good war scene, taking a pretty realistic, down to earth tone. This film started the trend towards realist violence in war films. The warfare was tough, fighting in the woods, plain fields and against forts.They is a pretty strong script by Kevin Jarre: easily his best work. They is a focus on character and the issues as well as the action, which he and Edward Zwick do very well. Zwick is an action director that gives his film a heart and issue to focus on. He has made some pretty good films in his time.The film is strong for the most part, but there are a couple of problems. First they are some historical inaccuracies which you just couldn't imagine really happening (but is still a lot better then Braveheart and Pearl Harbor). As I mention I thought the Sharts was a bit annoying and they are elements of the film which are clichéd. Finally I thought James Horner's score was overpowering, taking power away from the scenes. Sometimes silence is golden.Overall, a good film, 4 out of 5.",Glory

The 54th Regiment is one of history's most underrated and under-appreciated moments, and 1989's ""Glory"" follows its beginnings with a largely volunteer army of Freedmen and former slaves (who faced certain death from the Confederacy if they were ever caught), to its intense scrutiny by the supporting white brigades, and up until its final ""glorious"" moment when they were ushered into history when the 54th laid siege to Fort Wagner. Not many films have made me cry before, but the 54th, when they officially become a part of history, allowed me to ball my eyes out.

44,mjneu59,misguided historical drama,4,22 November 2010,"The true story of an all-black Union regiment in the Civil War (all but the officers, of course) would like to be a socially aware anti-war epic, but unfortunately there isn't anything in the film to suggest the title might be ironic. Instead, it offers all the usual patriotic myths of noble self-sacrifice, while choosing to ignore the sad fact that the only way an ex-slave could earn a white man's respect was to die fighting his wars for him. Even worse, the impression is left of the regiment being little more than a surrogate plantation, with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) literally whipping a rabble of black men into fighting shape. Denzel Washington earned a well-deserved Oscar as the only soldier able to face the truth (""no one will win""); by comparison Broderick, while in fact the same age as his character, resembles a high school drama student, chomping down on a mean cigar in a vain attempt to look less immature.

45,drqshadow-reviews,America's First Black Regiment Faces Bigotry From All Sides,8,18 July 2017,"A Civil War epic, following the trials and tribulations of the first all-black regiment in US history. At first they face enemies on both sides of the battlefield, but through such adversity comes dogged perseverance and they gradually convince their peers that not only is the cause a just one, but they all merit a role in the fight. Matthew Broderick is an unusual choice as the squad's tough, dedicated commander, only a few years removed from light-hearted comedy roles, and he isn't always convincing. The really meaty parts come from the troops themselves, anyway, and those ranks are filled out quite well. Morgan Freeman is excellent as the weathered voice of reason, a man who's seen the remnants of battle and tries to prepare the recruits for what's to come, but the standout performance belongs to a young Denzel Washington. As Private Trip, an escaped slave with a lifetime of pent-up anger that frequently threatens to swallow him, Washington's outbursts, protests, inner turmoil and ultimate vindication make up the film's lifeblood. Some of the battle scenes show their age, but that's not what it's about in the end, really. Heavy on the emotions and just a bit sappy, it's an important story done justice and a true dramatic powerhouse.",Glory

47,jimbo-53-186511,A good historical drama that never quite reaches the dizzying heights of brilliance,6,4 April 2021,"Glory follows Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and his command of the first all-black group of volunteer soldiers during the US Civil War. Along the way, Shaw faces backlash and prejudice from both the enemy and his own commanding officers. To make matters worse, one or two of the volunteer soldiers don't make life easy for Shaw either...Glory is a nicely-presented film with an interesting story and some of the acting talent on-board cannot be faulted, but there are just certain things niggling away at me about the film which prevent me from thinking of it as being anything better than merely good....I'm by no means an expert on the US Civil war and cannot verify how accurate this film portrays Shaw's actions/his training/the battle etc so I'm afraid I will have to concentrate on what is shown in the film to try and explain what I meanFor a start, I found some aspects of the script to be a bit simplistic and felt that unlikely situations got resolved far too easily for the sake of moving the narrative along; there are several instances involving Colonel Shaw where his back is against the rope when suddenly he is able to stack the deck back in his favour against seemingly impossible odds. Another example lies with Denzel Washington's character whereby one powerful speech from Morgan Freeman's character essentially brings about a complete U-turn in Washington's character. I have to admit that many of these moments made me smile and even gave me a minor sense of euphoria that everything was going in the right direction, but the cheap way it's all executed still left a bitter taste in my mouth.In defence of the film though some of the war and battle-related sequences are really good (particularly at the beginning and end) and director Ed Zwick definitely does not hold back in showcasing the brutality and horrors of war. Also as I mentioned earlier, the main cast are all very good (particularly Broderick who I've never been a big fan of in the past, but felt he did a really good job here). Also the final moments in the film are haunting and quite sobering (as I've said the war/battle scenes are by far the strongest moments of the film).Don't get me wrong Glory is a good film, but it does feel a tad simplistic and many of the characters depicted in the film are a little cliched and not particularly well-developed, but in fairness I would say that these negatives are just about offset by the positives that Glory brings to the table.",Glory

Edward Zwick created a masterpiece, which, in any other year, would have swept most of the major awards. Sadly, this did not even make the AFI Top 100 so inferior movies could squeeze in. In my opinion, the likes of Born on the Fourth of July and Driving Miss Daisy were vastly inferior to this film during the 1990 Academy Awards. I mean, how the heck were films like Dead Poets Society and My Left Foot nominated for best picture when  this one wasn't? (sure they were good films, but c'mon)Matthew Broderick completely surprised me with his performance, as well as Cary Elwes.

52,davidmvining,"Really good, but I want the longer version",8,12 October 2020,"There was a moment late in Edward Zwick's Glory when I realized that something was missing, and it was probably the best scene in the movie. It was that moment that told me that this was supposed to be a much larger film, and doing some light research afterwards proved that to be the case. Glory was written and shot to be an American epic in the vein of Lean, but it got cut down to two hours in post-production. Whether that was for financial reasons or because the stuff left out wasn't very good, I don't know, but there does seem to be noticeable missing elements here and there throughout. That's hard to unsee once it's noticed, but at the same time what is left in is really, really good.It's the Civil War and Major Shaw leads his men to the slaughter at Antietam. When it's all over, he's a scarred man, but he returns home to Boston where he's given a promotion to Colonel and command of the first regiment of black soldiers in the Union Army, the 54th Massachusetts. Presented with a fresh command and a new opportunity to prove himself, he jumps at the opportunity.The most interesting thing about Shaw as a character is that his motives could be one of two things, and I don't think the movie ever really tries to firmly answer whether it's one or the other. Shaw is either obsessed with leading a real command and a real regiment, and he's going to turn whomever the US Army hands over to him into real soldiers, or he's dedicated to racial equality and wants to make the men under him as equal to white soldiers for that reason. They're not mutually exclusive reasons and there seem to be indications of both motives, but that's what makes him an interesting character, possibly moving from one motive to the next.And either motive is a wonderful undercurrent for what Shaw does to ensure that his new recruits are ready for battle, but the conflict ends up being between Shaw's vision for his men and the Army bureaucracy's vision for them. He wants them to be soldiers, but the bureaucracy sees them as an inconvenience and a stunt. Shaw can't even get his men shoes, but he follows the normal procedure of requesting in order to get it done until a singular event.One of the recruits, Trip, sneaks out of camp is caught and held as a deserter. Typical punishment for a deserter is flogging (one change I would have made to the film would be to add a flogging scene at the very beginning in Antietam against a white soldier to sell the idea that flogging was normal against white soldiers), so when Trip is captured and brought back, it's time for the punishment like anyone else as Shaw would expect. But Trip's back is covered in scars from whippings as a slave. There's something wrong about this picture, and it's the fact that Shaw is treating them like soldiers while the rest of the Army is denying them the ability to soldier at all. Treating them like soldiers when they can't get the right equipment including basic footwear is cruel, so Shaw goes out and gets them shoes by upsetting the apple cart.The men drill and drill until they move no differently than any other regiment, eventually being sent south to South Carolina where they have their first skirmish and come out bravely. Then, in an effort to show their mettle, Shaw volunteers the 54th for the frontal charge on Fort Wagner, an impossible task that must happen in order for the larger attack on a different front to succeed.Now, all of this is done very well, but there seem to be holes here and there. That best scene in the movie I mentioned in the first paragraph? It's the night before the attack on Fort Wagner and Trip has to speak before the regiment during a revival type meeting. This is Denzel Washington's moment to shine, and shine he does giving a soulful moment of real vulnerability as he talks about how the 54th is the family he never had. The problem for me is that I never got the sense from him before that scene that he felt integrated into the rest of the regiment at all. He had been antagonistic towards most of the other characters, and then he had bravely fought in the skirmish. There seemed to be a scene missing where Trip and someone like Morgan Freeman's John or Andre Braugher's Thomas would have had a moment together, forging the friendship that Trip had been denying up to that point. I imagine there are at least a couple of scenes on the cutting room floor that directly address this.There's another moment that feels the same way. The 54th is marching towards the beach and the assault on Fort Wagner when a white officer off to the side that had had an altercation with Trip some time earlier announces with great emotion to give the Rebs hell. It's accompanied by swelling music, but it, again, kind of feels like it comes out of nowhere. There must be missing footage to fill in that hole.What I'm saying is that I kind of love what's here. It's really good. But, at the same time, I want the three and a half hour cut that fills in the holes, punches up Cary Elwes' part, expands Shaw's love interest to more than a cameo, and feels like the kind of epic this movie was trying to be. Because, while this is very good, I imagine that longer cut is actually great.",Glory

Check out all the hit movies that came out that year: Glory, Driving Miss Daisy, and Do The Right Thing. Even Black Rain, Lethal Weapon 2, Henry V and Casualties of War dealt with racial issues in some form or another. But perhaps it was Glory that paved the way for more movies of its kind for years to come.Glory stars Matthew Broderick in a 100% serious role as real life Robert Gould Shaw. I had my doubts with Broderick playing the protagonist in such a serious film and, well, I was satisfied. Usually when people break typecast roles, their anomaly usually automatically comes out great. With Matthew Broderick, this did not apply. I didn't think he was bad, just satisfactory. It wasn't that Ferris Bueller was stuck in my head or anything like that. For one thing, Broderick constantly switches from an Irish accent to a regular American accent. What the hell? But other than that, he wasn't captivating or dominant and there was a medium level conviction. If somebody else played the role of Shaw, I likely would have placed Glory higher on my Best of 1989 list.So Matthew Broderick is not A-1 in this, but that's fine. There are many other redeeming qualities. Glory takes place during the Civil War and is about Shaw who quickly moves up the ranks as a soldier and is assigned to train a pure-black army of slaves in battle. Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman are part of his squad and they lead a cast of equally talented lesser-knowns. This was Denzel's first Oscar win and it still remains one of his best performances. He steals every shot where he appears on screen.Probably the biggest flack given to this was that it is not from the point of view from one of the black people. This was the first all-black American army troop and a white man is the protagonist. Yes, Shaw does not know what it was like to be a slave in those times, but having Shaw as the main character is good because he is so unused to the cruelty inflicted on his men. Shaw is the character that changes the most, because he first thinks that the men are being mistreated for valid reasons, when it is really exploitation. The regular side of the coin really gets a chance to see how he and his people are and how he must change. He is scared about making the change, but knows it is the right thing to do.Every good war movie needs to have great action, and that is exactly what Glory delivers, all the way through to its shocking ending. What I also liked was how much overall chemistry there was and how much the plot moved forward. The movie actually starts off a bit slow, but it keeps a constant pace of getting better and more rich. Maybe I will think more of this the next time I watch it.3.5/4",Glory
55,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,As Great As Gettysburg (1993),10,27 December 2011,"I was introduced to this film when I was in middle school. Of course, our class did not watch it fully; we were only shown a piece of it. It never came back into my mind of watching it again until I graduated high school. It was when I looked back on what I remembered, and I thought to myself, ""I need to watch that civil war movie again"". So I did, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.For its genre, which is drama, I can imagine it is hard to make something like the civil war so realistic and but no too overblown. What we have here is piece of cinema that digs down into America's past and gives the viewer an eye opening experience of what the civil war was like. Even more persuasive are the characters portrayed by the actors in this movie. Not many people recognize or even know of the African American Infantry who fought during the war and this is one of the best depictions of that. I didn't even know of any until I watched this film.Matthew Broderick stars as Colonel Robert Shaw who is given the task of leading an African American division for the Union. Although Broderick has the voice of kid, he fits the part of Shaw well. Along side him is Cary Elwes who is Shaw's right hand man and good friend. As for the African American actors in this film, who are too many to list, make the movie have emotion in almost every scene. This is what makes the movie work. It shows the strife and the hard labor that the soldiers had to endure. The part I felt the worst about was when the Irish Commander was training them. There was no break with this guy.The reality of this movie is great too. Both big major budget films such as Gods and Generals (2003) and Gettysburg (1993) were not totally brutal with their killing scenes. On the other hand for this film, there is plenty of it. Soldiers with missing limbs, graphic stabbing and even heads blowing up are all in this. So if you want a civil war film that gives you blood and guts, this is that film.Finally what makes this film so powerful is the soundtrack provided by the talented James Horner. If Horner had not composed the music for this film, I'm not sure if Glory would have become so popular as it is now. The way the music is inserted in certain scenes is so reflective. Horner's music brought me to reality of what military life was like back then. It almost brought a tear to my eye and that is hard to do. If you end up loving this movie, the soundtrack is the second best thing to have.Glory is arguably the best American Civil War movie ever made. An amazing cast and distinguished musical score not only make this movie excel in its story but also makes the viewer understand what ""glory"" feels like.",Glory
56,denis888,Civil War Movie Masterpiece,10,3 July 2011,"I was first a bit skeptical about Glory since I am not a huge Matthew Broderick fan, but the watch changed my perception of him drastically. Here, Matthew delivered one of his greatest and most breathtaking roles with such deep understanding and thorough sincerity that his performance really rocks high. Not only him, both Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman play admirably deeply and convincingly well. The theme of African-American troops in the US Civil War is immensely interesting and Edward Zwick did a real great job. Two hours of a movie fly so fast that you never notice the time. The plot, the camera work, the sound, the soundtrack - all seam together well and very smoothly. The heroism, tragedy and immense triumph of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry is shown so greatly and so truly, that Glory ranks well with such all-time greats as Gettysburg or Gods And Generals. This is a great war movie, with warm look on Black soldiers and their everyday lives, their faith and their heroic deaths in the action. The movie is very highly recommended.",Glory
57,sme_no_densetsu,A finely crafted war film,8,17 May 2008,"This film is based (loosely) on the history of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment. They were a trailblazing group, one of the first all-black regiments in the U.S. Army.The film sports some tremendous African-American actors, particularly Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, who won his first Oscar for his supporting role here. I'm not entirely convinced by Matthew Broderick's performance, though. Perhaps my doubts are based on the fact that Shaw is portrayed as a human being rather than the a one-dimensional 'hero' like those which Hollywood usually spoon-feeds the public. I'm not certain that Broderick has the chops to pull it off.The script is well written and mostly avoids the likely pitfalls for a story of this sort. Those pitfalls include a self-congratulatory tone, an inflated sense of accomplishment and a surplus of sentimentality. Thankfully, this is a war film that lives up to its name and does so with a minimum of self-important flag-waving.The direction (by Edward Zwick) is ably handled but not especially noteworthy. James Horner's score, on the other hand, is not exactly to my liking. I find it too self-consciously 'inspiring' when understatement would have better suited the picture. That being said, it isn't too distracting and the story is legitimately inspiring anyways.Taken together, this makes for a solid war film. Even though it falls short of perfection in a few key areas it's still much better than run-of-the-mill fare. Definitely a picture worthy of your attention, regardless of whether or not you're a fan of war films.",Glory
58,Screen_Blitz,This Civil War period piece is simply stunning,9,25 October 2016,"Set in the mid-1800s when the South was ravaged by slavery of the African-American descent and society was plagued by the spread of racial prejudice against all outside the White protestant, this Edward Zwick directed period piece pulls viewers into the harsh reality of the Civil War, a violent, bloody conflict between the Union and Confederacy that changed the face of America forever; but without the deaths of many American lives. Based on true historical events, this Civil War epic sees a charismatic cast of Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington each in one of their most alluring roles of their career, with performances that shine like gold and a beautifully written story that drives on an irresistibly powerful journey through the heart of one of America's harshest periods. The film tells the intriguing story of Colonel Robert Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick) following his injury in the devastating Battle of Antieham, a soldier of the Union Army who lead the first African American infantry unit on the battlefield with his childhood friend Lieutenant Cabot Forbes (played by Cary Elwes)second in command. Some of his unit recruits include former slave Private Silas Trip (played by Denzel Washington) and Sergeant Major John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) as these brave men sprawl across the South in a blood-raging battle against the Confederate Army.What becomes of a war for freedom costs the lives of the brave ones who are willing to fight for it, and this historical epic doesn't pull the punches when showing this. Opening up with the brutal depiction of the Battle of Antieham that ends in gruesome imagery of mortally wounded soldiers, this film sees Edward Zwick portraying the reality of the Civil War in arguably one of its finest cinematic depictions yet, if not the best. The story which is written by Kevin Jarre magnificently sets off a compelling journey of Colonel Robert Shaw and his daunting effort to lead a group of African-Americans in a fight for justice, while facing various tribulations of war and the hardships of keeping the old soldiers in lane. While the characters (even Robert Shaw) are by no means unlikable, they are definitely shown to be conflicted with inner demons; particularly from the results of their experience of racial prejudice, And this provides plenty of elements of substance. As the story progresses, we are allowed precious time to explore the heroism of the characters as well as their uncertain flaws including the rebellious Silas Trip played by Denzel Washington who is deeply absorbing and emotionally investing in his role, a man who struggles to face the hardships of role and rebels against his fellow commander; resulting in a emotionally powerful whipping scene. Matthew Broderick and his co-stars Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman are also given the opportunity the stretch their immersive talent in their roles. But in the end, it is Washington who becomes the primary source of poignancy.Glory is a stunning Civil War epic that succeeds on a smart narrative scope, but not without the enchanting performance by Matthew Broderick and the leading source of emotional resonance by Denzel Washington. Though this isn't the grittiest war picture out there, especially when compared to more modern efforts in the war genre. But it is definitely a smart one that is more than worth sitting through.",Glory
59,mstomaso,One of the greatest period films ever made,10,30 July 2005,"This film explores one of the African American contributions to the American Civil War, through the story of the 54th Regiment, an experimental fighting force lead by white colonel Robert Shaw. loosely based on Shaw's real-life story, this film creates a powerful context for exploring racial politics, courage, dignity, hope, trust and the cause of freedom in the American late 19th century.There are not enough praises in the English language to express how I feel about this incredibly emotional and amazingly well acted film. There were also not enough academy awards, nor any other award, to give Glory the recognition it deserved. This is a story of triumphant humanity and respect from which every denizen of planet earth could take important lessons. Everybody involved with this film should be commended for helping to bring it about. The cast never mis-steps, and the cinematography, script and editing make the entire two hours of the film flood by like a river which has still not quite reached the sea.There are black heroes and white heroes in this film. There is also a study of cowardice in its many forms, colors, and ways. And there is a certain redemption, hope and love running throughout the film which makes it the classic it has become. There is no sense in describing the plot. Suffice to say, the story brings tears to my eyes every time.",Glory
60,hnt_dnl,Perhaps the real Best Picture of 1989!,10,13 July 2009,"How in the heck did GLORY not get nominated for Best Picture! A travesty! Note to Academy: Do SOMETHING right! GLORY is the engrossingly powerful re-enactment of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, a command of entirely African-American MEN during the Civil War, whose services were needed due to heavy losses by the Union Army. President Lincoln ordered the induction of black men into the Union to help turn the tide of the war. These men are freed slaves, escaped slaves, or already free men from the North. Just saw this film again recently and it holds up amazingly well 20 years later.GLORY stars Matthew Broderick in the role of a lifetime as Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the leader of this regiment. At first hesitant due to projected backlash of commanding a Negro regiment, Shaw agrees to do it. Broderick relays a real humanity in Shaw that helps carry the film to its inevitable conclusion. A vastly underrated performance where a bunch of so-called film critics complained that the film should have been about the soldiers more. But it was! While Shaw narrates the story, it manages not to make him the focus and allows the viewer to see the men through Shaw's eyes, which are non-prejudicial and objective eyes indeed! This is the genius of Broderick's performance: no sentimentality, but perfect doses of empathy, toughness, and clarity. Make no mistake: Broderick is not the star of GLORY, but without his performance, the film would not work as well as it does!Now to the soldiers: The great Morgan Freeman plays Rawlings a proud gravedigger who has seen just as much carnage as Shaw and meets him early in the film at Antietam. Both men sadly know what war is really all about. Freeman is underrated, too, as he emanates quiet dignity, but here I'm more impressed than by some of his bigger roles like in DRIVING MISS DAISY and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Rawlings is a man's man in every sense.Then newcomer Andre Braugher is excellent as Thomas, the dignified friend of Col. Shaw, a free Bostonian black man who volunteers to be in Shaw's regiment. Jihmi Kennedy is heartbreakingly good as Jupiter, a sweet, yet slow man who is looking for dignity in a racist world himself. And of course Best Supporting Oscar winner Denzel Washington as runaway slave Tripp, all bluster and full of anger, hatred, and remorse. Washington's Oscar was well-deserved. As great as Washington is though, the rest of these actors are just as exceptional and should not be overshadowed. Additionally, Cary Elwes is extremely fine as Shaw's second in command and best friend Major Forbes.GLORY is one of the most emotional films that one will ever have the joy of seeing. And while the outcome is dire for these brave soldiers, the film is monumentally uplifting and never strays or gets plodding or sentimental. The building up of these men into real soldiers is powerful and at the end you see what war (sadly) is all about.Director Edward Zwick should forever be remembered for this triumph. It won 5 Oscars, but wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. Absurd!",Glory
61,jhclues,Powerful and Historically Accurate Film,10,15 June 2001,"Even as the Civil War was being fought, it was history in the making, and one of it's many chapters involved a stretch of beach on a peninsula in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, where in July of 1863, the Confederates had ensconced themselves in the strategically prominent Fort Wagner.  And the Federal command had determined that it must be taken at all costs.  But it would be a veritable suicide mission for the regiment that served as the vanguard of the assault; therefore, volunteers were called upon, rather than being chosen arbitrarily by the General in command.  At this point, a young Colonel from Boston, Robert Gould Shaw, stepped forward to offer his regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first unit comprised of black soldiers in the history of the U.S. Army, for the job.  `Glory,' directed by Edward Zwick, is their story.	Soon after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, the Army was opened up to blacks; and the first to respond were those who ultimately made up the 54th.  Shaw, an abolitionist, was approached about taking command, and he accepted, putting his beliefs on the line and determining to make real soldiers of these men.  And he did.  In the beginning, however, he had no idea of the formidable task awaiting them in the not too distant future, when they would face an enemy bastion that was heavily fortified, well manned and which maintained a decidedly advantageous position geographically.  But leading up to that, Shaw had his men trained properly and stood by them as they formed the bonds amongst themselves that ultimately saw them through the battles they had to fight, on the field and off.  It was rough going; but under Shaw's command, they were able to secure something they had never had in their lives-- dignity as human beings.	Going into this project, director Zwick was adamant about adhering to historical accuracy in all areas of the story, from the events themselves, to the smallest, seemingly insignificant details they would put on the screen.  And he succeeded.  When the soldiers of the 54th, for example, are informed that their pay would be ten dollars a month, minus three dollars for clothing expenses-- seven real dollars pay-- instead of the thirteen they had been promised (which was the pay the white soldiers received), Shaw and his officers, in a show of solidarity, tear up their own pay envelopes and refuse to accept their wages until their men get their full pay.  The battles, as well, from Antietam to Fort Wagner, are authentically represented.  The assault on Fort Wagner, especially, seems like an almost romantic notion of gallantry, but the fact that if happened just as depicted here makes it all the more involving.  Zwick painstakingly recreated every aspect of the battle, and sets it up geographically and in such a way that the viewer is able to anticipate, without getting lost as the action unfolds.  The outcome of the battle is, of course, a matter of historic record, and especially for those well versed in the history of the Civil War, this film should be an entirely satisfying experience.	Matthew Broderick gives an engaging, understated performance as Shaw that captures the essence of the man, whom we get to know initially through his own words, from the letters he wrote home during his time in the Army (which are now kept in the Houghton Library at Harvard University).  The film begins, in fact, with one of Shaw's letters being read over the action. Throughout the film, Zwick uses this method to move the story along, as well as to give some real insight into Shaw, and through his thoughts, the men of the 54th and the events in which they are engaged.  And Broderick seems to embody the man you picture as being the author of the words being read.  He portrays Shaw, not as a cinematic, John Wayne type superhero, but heroic in a very real sense; as he leads his men against Fort Wagner, you see a man obviously afraid, but determined to uphold his principles and ideals, for which he is willing to die.  It's not a flashy role, but Broderick, by creating a character to whom virtually everyone will be able to relate and sympathize, is clearly the strength and the star of the film. 
	There are a number of outstanding performances in supporting roles, also, particularly Denzel Washington, who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Trip, the embittered former slave who is at war, not only with the Confederates, but with life.  Trip is a complex character, and Washington gets to his soul, awakening the bitterness as well as the somewhat caustic humor with which he wages his daily battles.  From the first scene in which he appears, Washington dominates the screen, even in the scenes in which Trip is not the center of attention.  It's a powerful performance, without question deserving of the Award.  Morgan Freeman gives a memorable performance, as well, as Sergeant Major John Rawlins, the elder statesmen of the 54th, who in his way sets an example for the younger soldiers, and eventually even Trip.  Also worthy of mention are Andre Braugher, as Thomas, and Jihmi Kennedy as Jupiter Sharts.	The supporting cast includes Cary Elwes (Major Forbes), John Finn (Mulcahy), Donovan Leitch (Morse), Bob Gunton (Harker), Cliff De Young (Montgomery) and Jay O. Sanders (General Strong).  Beginning with an accurate and insightful screenplay (by Kevin Jarre), Zwick uses all the tools at his disposal, including great cinematography (by Freddie Francis, who received the Oscar) and some memorable performances, to deliver an unforgettable and historically significant film.  Zwick is to be commended for the honesty of this film, and for maintaining the integrity of the story, which he never embellished simply for dramatic effect, which simply wasn't necessary; the drama that the 54th Massachusetts played out in real life was enough.  And that is what Zwick presents, in `Glory.'  I rate this one 10/10.",Glory
62,rupie,glorious!,7,9 July 1999,"This story of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first all-black unit to fight in the Civil War, will appeal to Civil War buffs and history fans in general, as well as devotees of war movies, and those drawn to the social aspects of the story.The film deals with the difficulty the regiment had in dealing with the entrenched antipathy of the regular troops, the public,  and the War Dept. in accepting an all-black unit. They were formed with reluctance, given supplies grudgingly, and were at first used only for manual labor in the war effort.Due to Shaw's persistence, however, they were finally given combat duty, in which they demonstrated exceptional bravery, winning the respect of all concerned.It's an excellent film all around; good performances (I expected Broderick, with his youth, to have trouble with the part of Shaw, but he turns in a very creditable performance), good script, good photography, and the battle sequences are truly blood-curdling.Historical accuracy was obviously important to the makers of this film. A battlefield guide at Gettysburg informed our party that 'Glory' was the most accurate Civil War film he had seen, far exceeding the much-vaunted 'Gettysburg'.The movie lags just a bit here & there, but overall it is gripping and inspiring. It's a must-see.A note for metropolitan Boston residents: Shaw and the 54th are commemorated in a bronze bas-relief by the sculptor St. Gaudens on the Boston Common, facing the steps of the statehouse (the sculpture forms the backdrop for the final credits).",Glory

Everything about this film is excellent and inspiring. The entire cast is wonderful. The direction is flawless. The music is awe inspiring. The story is unforgettable. Any words I could come up with could never give this film the props it deserves. I wanted to scream when I heard this film wasn't even up for best picture in 1989. What in the hell were those Hollywood idiots thinking?The film portrays the struggles of the first black United States regiment of soldiers during the Civil War. We are shown not only their battle for acceptance as a regular regiment, but the ferocious combat they saw on the front lines. The film captures all of these elements with incredible accuracy and sincerity. We get to know only four of the soldiers personally, as well as two of the officers, but we come away feeling like we knew all of the men in the 54th Massachusetts. Washington was well deserving of his Oscar. Morgan Freeman should have gotten one, too. In fact, the Oscars that year should have been named ""The Glory Show"". There are numerous scenes that make even a stoic midwesterner like me break down into tears as the action unfolds. The most haunting are when Washington is whipped for what the officers believe is an escape attempt, and the final battle scene. I could go on forever about this film, but I won't. SEE IT!!! You may not like it as much as I did. War movies are not for everyone. It will at least move you in some way, though.God bless the men of the 54th Massachusetts.

The really meaty parts come from the troops themselves, anyway, and those ranks are filled out quite well. Morgan Freeman is excellent as the weathered voice of reason, a man who's seen the remnants of battle and tries to prepare the recruits for what's to come, but the standout performance belongs to a young Denzel Washington. As Private Trip, an escaped slave with a lifetime of pent-up anger that frequently threatens to swallow him, Washington's outbursts, protests, inner turmoil and ultimate vindication make up the film's lifeblood.

This could have easily been a ""paint by numbers"" film but Zwick makes it something more, putting the emphasis on the soldiers and the obstacles they need to overcome and downplaying the danger and the violence. Don't get me wrong - the action sequences are intense and well made, they just aren't the point of the film.The point of the film are the men who are involved - and the 5 leads are tremendous. Morgan Freeman shows the grace and leadership and authority that he would bring to many, many pictures. Elwes shows that he can command a screen, if given a chance and Denzel sparkles in his scenes. This picture shows a true movie star being born. But the real surprises for me on this viewing is the work of Matthew Broderick, playing a very different character than the light comedy performances we had seen from him in films like FERRIS BUELLER and on the stage that we would come to know him as in such musicals as THE PRODUCERS. This film shows that he has some wonderful acting chops and is just at home with a dramatic role as he is with a light comedic role.But...the actor that really stood out from the others in this showing is the great Andre Braugher in his first Major Motion Picture appearance. He would go on to shine brightly in such roles as Detective Pembleton in HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS and currently is starring as Captain Holt in BROOKLYN 99, but in Glory he was an unknown commodity and his portrayal of free, educated black man Thomas Searles - a childhood friend of both the Broderick and Elwes characters - who must adjust to being one of ""the men"" with this collection of uneducated former slaves and live in a tiered relationship with 2 men that are his peers and friends is heartbreaking to watch. Even though I was thrilled with Washington's Oscar (he does have the ""Oscar scene"" in this film), I thought Braugher's performance was just as good - maybe even better.All of this leads the audience to a finale that is intense - and intensely personal - for you are invested in these men as they face insurmountable odds and most certain death.I've been re-watching quite a few movies lately, and GLORY is one that hit me harder - and is better - than I remembered. Well worth checking out.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Glory

70,grahamsj3,Glory-ous!,9,21 December 2000,"This is a terrific semi-historical film set during the Civil War. Matthew Broderick portrays Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who trained the first fully combat-ready Black Regiment for the US Army. This film depicts the history of the 54th Massachusetts and how they (including the White officers leading them) were disliked and even hated on BOTH sides. I think many people assume that the citizens of the North all loved black people and wanted to see them freed. The truth is, there were a lot of Northerners who were at best disinterested in the plight of the black people. Shaw had to fight a great deal of racism to get his men any basic equipment, uniforms and the right to become combat soldiers and subsequently to actually be utilized in battle. The Regiment ultimately made a strong contribution to the Union war effort. The film is superbly cast and very well acted. There are few really memorable scenes in the film, but there is one great scene between Trip (Denzel Washington) and Rawlins (Morgan Freeman). I thought that Jihmi Kennedy did a fine job as Jupiter Sharts as did Andre Braugher as Thomas Searles. I highly recommend this film to anyone!",Glory
71,Tito-8,Not quite as good as it should have been,8,7 February 1999,"As something of an American Civil War buff, I was hoping and maybe even expecting to love this movie.  Unfortunately, there was something missing, although I can't really identify what wasn't there.  Technically speaking, the film is flawless.  The recreations are truly stunning, and the acting is about as good as it gets.  So I'm not really sure how to accurately criticize this picture, since my rational thinking tells me that this movie had it all.  Then again, perhaps I have just identified the problem, for I am reflecting on this film not with my heart, but with my head.",Glory
72,jdkraus,The Greatest Civil War movie!,10,7 February 2007,"I'm a person who doesn't get impressed easily with most movies, particularly with war films. But after seeing this film, I was left paralyzed with awe. I had never seen such a powerfully driven war film that comes close to as grand as this (save for Braveheart). Based upon the inspiring true story of the 54th Massachusettes, of 600 colored men whom are hired as Union soldiers to fight in the war that divided the American nation, the film had everything darn near perfect.The film had a powerhouse of performances: Mathew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman. People rip on Broderick for being sleazy as the 21 year-old Gould Shaw, but I differ, for he gave a preference that was so moving, that it makes me nearly cry that he did not get at least an Oscar nomination.Denzel Washington by far gave the best performance as the conflicted, young, runaway slave, Private Trip, whom is driven by rage, sarcasm, and pride. Every single shot of him on camera shines with these bursting personalities and also revealing a hidden character of courage and honor who seeks dignity and respect (representing the true spirit of the 54th Massachusettes). The Oscar he won was truly worthy, and never have i seen such a grand performance as his in years.Lastly, Morgan Freeman, once again proves to be one of the best actors alive. He plays the quiet, but compassionate Rawlins, who earns the rank of Sergeant Major in the regiment. With his persuasive voice and words of wisdom and comfort, he holds the entire regiment together from breaking apart, as he demonstrates in a confrontation, later in the film, with Trip, saying ""We need to getty up and kick in like men!"" Freeman was simply amazing! The rest of the cast, including Cary Elwes, Andre Braugher, and Jihmi Kennedy was also highly believable and stellar in their performances.The music score by James Horner was gripping, and should also have gotten at least an Oscar nom for. The cinematography was beautiful, the set-decoration was authentic, and the sound and sound mixing in the battle sequences were realistic. But on a downside note, the battle scenes lacked the ferocity and intensity as Bravehart held; the violence was no different than Gettysburg, for it looked more like an reenactment rather than actual war. The staging and some of the choreography was a bit hokey. Nonethless, it had some graphic moments to it, that pushed for a meager R rating. Even though it lacked the brutality of war, the battles were still intense and emotionally moving, which was aided by James Horner's magnificent score. And another note to add, throughout the film there are many laughable mistakes from historical errors to ""sight gags"". Other than a couple of these flaws, the film gave a strong, solid soul. Glory remains and always will be on my top ten favorite lists of movies, as well as the greatest civil war film ever. It is film that defies prejudice and oppression and shows that no matter what race you are or the color of skin you have, you are a living person.**** out of ****",Glory
73,davyd-02237,GLORY!,8,30 September 2018,"If you want entertainment from a ""war film"" this is not it. It pulls NO punches, it is based upon historical fact and is very well presented with a really great cast. You will see men sacrificing their lives for a nation that (in the main) treated them at this stage of history as slaves. This is about the fight for freedom and the sacrifice that many were willing to pay. I would argue outstanding. It is not entertaining, it is worth watching, but not with your children, if you have children!",Glory
74,bopdog,"A miraculous and brilliant movie-- ALL the history must be considered, however!!!",10,27 May 2002,"Director Zwick set out for a really tough task when he decided to make ""Glory."" Think about it--- he wants to combine solid entertainment with accurate history. PLUS--- he wants to capture one of the core values of the American psyche, our Civil war, and do justice to all of it in a couple of hours. First, all those who carp and nitpick upon the film's possible lack of ""divine perfection"" should be ashamed! Given all those goals, Zwick, his technical crews, and the superb cast all did a magnificent job. The movie is brilliant. Second, a better understanding of the history might help appreciate this marvelous achievement.Some have knocked the Col. Robert Gould Shaw character as whimpy and pale, too young to be a proper colonel. Hey--- this is the history part: The actor Matthew Broderick actually looks exactly like actual photos of Shaw. Shaw WAS young, and he was the pampered son of a rich family. Can't help that now-- that's what happened. And regardless of his whimpiness, note that he DID willingly go off to battle with the 54th, losing his life in the process. Letters from members of the 54th recount how much Shaw was devoted to his men and the whole social evolutionary process the 54th experiment was engaged in. Evidently Shaw was genuinely loved and respected by his men. Eyewitnesses in the midst of the battle itself report that Shaw was indeed a brave and inspirational officer right up to the end.History can never be effectively understood through the values of the present. Any historian or historician will tell you that. Historical events must be understood in terms of the times in which they occurred. Slavery is an evil and horrible thing on any continent, in any culture, and in any century. Given the circumstances that it did exist, however, one must view the recovery process from slavery realistically. To recover from slavery--- as a slave or a slave-holder--- could not have been an easy or quick process. It was probably extremely difficult, and probably required an heroic amount of strength, endurance, and courage. Certainly many folks of those times undoubtedly never made the transition, and suffered for the rest of their lives in one way or the other.The heroism of those who took the steps that they could take in those times should not be sullied or unvaunted merely because we modern people find the whole episode embarrassing or unbefitting our modern self-righteous self-important notions of how people are ""supposed to act.""The marvelous actor Morgan Freeman, a real hero of mine, says on the ""Glory"" DVD commentary that President Lincoln was not interested in freeing the slaves, and was not interested in black freedoms, as evidenced by the fact that the Emancipation Proclamation (the decree that ""freed the slaves"") was not issued until 1863, two years after the Civil War started. Perhaps-- but I have heard history professors and ""Lincoln experts"" lecture that Lincoln's interest in abolishing slavery was genuine and a guiding force of his political and public life for many years before he became president. These Lincoln historians said that Lincoln was also a consummate politician and realist--- i.e., he knew that to agitate for emancipation before the Union forces began to win battles was futile. In fact, his realistic appraisal of the times in which he lived was such that he knew that to emancipate the slaves any earlier would have shattered the Union, split all of his support, and lost the war. In effect, bad timing in the political realities of the day would have established the Confederacy and its slave economy forever. Thus, Lincoln the realist timed his actions in the only way he could have and still achieved his goals of ending the horrors of slavery.Lest our British cousins feel any degree of superiority about this bit of ""dirty laundry"" in our American past, recall that Britain only outlawed slavery in 1850--- a scant 13 years before Lincoln. AND, the British government tried to enter the American Civil War on the side of the Confederates, in exchange for which the British would have access to the largest cotton supply in the world at that time, along with the cheap slave labor (Shocked? Look it up!). The American Southerners would have received inclusion in the British aristocracy--- dukes, earls, knights, and what-nots. What ultimately prevented this 3rd British invasion of America was the British working-class mill-workers. They protested and rioted by the tens-of-thousands, and threatened to revolt if Britain went ahead with their new war plans. Did the British Poor riot to defend the rights of the American slaves? Or to protect their own jobs? Doesn't matter. Maybe both reasons--- but their stubborness did save the Union and effectively insure the freedom of the slaves here.Sorry for the speech-- the point is that any historical decade in a country such as ours is a VERY complicated affair. The wonderful movie ""Glory"" does a miraculous job--- not telling every story, of course, but of telling SOME of the stories, some of the truth, and conveying a vibe that was historically and spiritually consistent with all the stories. And to the millions of Afro-Americans who stayed away from this movie, perhaps because it is too painful to watch--- be proud, be brave, and celebrate what your great-great-great-grandfathers did. It is an amazing story, and ""Glory"" tells it well.",Glory
75,PersianPlaya408,Glory is a very good war film about humanity and ethics,9,19 January 2006,"This is a brilliantly directed war film aboout African American civil war troop which was the first to ever be an all-black company in combat. Lead by Robert G. Shaw (Broderick) and with very interesting characters from Denzel Washington and Morgan freeman, this film is both entertaining and thought-provoking as a war film. This is a classic example of well written and acted cinema with a capable director, Edward Zwick. Denzel Was great in this film as was Freeman, both Oscar worthy. Broderick was also good, as was Cary Elwes who is a bit underrated.Overall film rating: 9/10",Glory
76,sethn172,This is a good civil war film!,10,21 February 2006,"I've seen this movie twice now - once as a sophomore in high school in U.S. History class, and on the two-disc special edition DVD. This is a good movie to watch for historical and educational values, but of the two times I've watched this movie, I prefer the 2-disc DVD over the VHS. Why? For two reasons: 1. You have a choice of two aspect ratios (one for each DVD disc): the original 2.35:1 widescreen aspect on the blue disc, disc 1, or the cropped 1.33:1 fullscreen aspect on the red disc, disc 2. I've watched the widescreen version first and the fullscreen version twice (reason later).2. You have lots of languages to choose from. The widescreen version has English and French audio, but the fullscreen ratio has not only those two languages, but Spanish and now Portuguese as well! And both discs have English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai subtitles (and some websites mention Indonesian as well even though that is really not an option)!

79,RossRivero99,One of the best war movies ever made,10,23 February 2017,"Edward Zwick's ""Glory"" is the best war movie that he directed and one that to me that is even better than his ""The Last Samurai"" that he ended up directing 14 years after this movie in 2003. The movie stars Matthew Broderick as Colonel Robert Gould Shaw the man who was responsible for leading the first all black regiment in American military history, and Broderick happens to give the best performance of his career in this movie and this is the best movie he starred in since John Hughes's ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986) but only this movie is better than that one. This movie also ranks with some of the best war movies ever made such as ""Platoon"" (1986), ""Patton"" (1970), ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978),""The Hurt Locker"" (2009), and ""American Sniper"" (2014). This movie also has an exceptional cast of characters that are part of this regiment such as Shaw's right hand man Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), Private Trip (Denzel Washington), Sergeant Major John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman), Corporal Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), and many more. During the course of this movie we see that Colonel Shaw and Major Forbes often have frustrations with their regiment not only because when they start training for the war (in this case the Civil War) and they don't know how to do anything that a soldier does even after they are taught how to do it, the screenplay for this movie was written by Kevin Jarre who totally nailed it on the head with his script from the book by Lincoln Kirstein and Peter Burchard, as well as Colonel Shaw's letters. The movie ended up winning 3 Oscars 27 years ago including best supporting actor for Denzel Washington, best cinematography and best sound which the movie totally deserved. Director Edward Zwick does a fantastic job of showing how and why war is hell, and that the bond between soldiers in times of war is unbreakable which is what the Dire Straits song ""Brothers in Arms"" from 4 years earlier is all about and it has been proved throughout not just our history but throughout the history of the world. the movie is also the first movie that Denzel Washington did for Edward Zwick and the movies that they would do in the future would be ""Courage Under Fire "" (1996), and ""The Siege"" (1998). This is one of 1989's greatest films.",Glory

81,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: good except for Broderick,7,23 May 2004,"Glory is a true story worth telling, and I always give those the benefit of the doubt. For example, Pearl Harbor was a little campy but I thought it held together fine. Glory is also worth seeing, although I have two reservations.The first one is small. Any true to life story has a rich context and it's difficult to tell what's happening in the world outside the story, why the scenes are important, and which character has what goals. One film that succeeds phenomenally in this is Thirteen Days. Glory takes a stab at it, but often I was left wondering what was historic and what was irrelevant. Does our protagonist empathize with the black men or not? I am guessing this was not a clean story to tell; the good guys aren't all good and they dressed it up for the movie.More importantly, there is some great acting by Denzel Washington and others. But not by Matthew Broderick. How shall I say this politely? He destroys every scene he is in. He doesn't seem very angry in the angry scenes. His character is conflicted but we don't get a sense of passion. The entire story revolves around a weak man finding his courage... the theme is totally lost. Perhaps one of the black men should have been the protagonist. While I'm on this topic, Cary Elwes was bad as usual as well. I don't know, both actors are too boyish and tend to sound like they're reading their lines.So although I loved the story I spend the film thinking dark thoughts about Matthew Broderick.Who should see this film:-- War / history buffs-- Drama fans, if you can take the acting-- People who like action flicks, maybe on a rainy day, or better yet, skip it. See Saving Private Ryan.I'll give Glory a 7 out of 10, sort of a bonus 6 for being on such an important topic.",Glory
82,Rickting,Glorious,10,14 November 2014,"Glory came out of nowhere for me. I was looking for something good to watch on Netflix and I decided to try this as it was meant to be good. What followed was sheer perfection. Glory is a breath-taking, heroic, almost super human juggernaut of a historical epic which is an incredibly moving and brilliantly acted movie which somehow wasn't nominated for best picture in a year when the winner was a film about Morgan Freeman driving an old woman around. This is the story of the first all black army regiment in the American civil war. It's a true story which hasn't been focused on enough and it tells it superbly. Matthew Broderick ditches all traces of Ferris Bueller and delivers a surprisingly mature and strong performance as the leader of the regiment. Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington are both outstanding and Edward Zwick's direction is fantastic. Not only is the cinematography stunning but the battle sequences are incredibly intense and truly capture the hellishness of war.The script is skilfully handled; covering a lot of stuff without excess exposition and without sentimentality and manipulation. You grow to care about all of the characters and ultimately it is a very sad and emotional movie. The deaths of 2 of the main characters at the end is genuinely upsetting. Glory is also a very useful film for history and always feels accurate and honest. There aren't many flaws with Glory and it had me hooked for the entirety of its 2 hour run time. Glory is definitely one of the best historical drama movies of all time and shows that they are certainly not boring. With its fine direction, acting and writing Glory renders an important true story in sublime detail and turns it into a moving, masterful epic. It's not the most well known movie out there but it deserves far more attention than it gets. This is absolutely monumental filmmaking and is a testament both to the talents of Washington and Freeman and the power, relevance and importance of history.10/10",Glory

I have not seen it for two years, but after I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" I started to think about ""Glory"" and how superior ""Glory"" is to SPR. I even mentioned ""Glory"" as the better film in my review of SPR. I saw it for the first time on TV in 1995. I had missed the first 30 minutes but was still unable to switch channel after watching only a few minutes of the movie.I cried for about an hour after the movie had ended, mainly because I spent an hour writing about the movie in my diary and therefore remembered all the scenes once again.

86,bat-5,Outstanding!,9,14 May 1999,"One of the first memories I have of Glory is the opening battle.  The Union soldiers march slowly toward the Confederates.  As they get closer, cannon fire rains down on them.  Men go flying through the air and dust and smoke start to cloud the sky.  Artillery rounds rip through the air and scatter the ranks.  As the soldiers get closer, the Confederates open fire with their rifles and more fall.  Soon the entire field is in chaos as men look for cover and begin to retreat.  Matthew Broderick displays stoic bravery under this hellacious fire.  A cannon round explodes and blows apart the officer's head that was standing in front of him.  Men crawl away, with limbs missing and the field is littered with bodies.Never before has the Civil War been shown so realisticly.  The costumes, the weapons, and the way armies fought are accurate.  The performances are first rate too.  Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington shine. Equal credit goes to Andre Braugher and Cary Elwes.  The final assault the 54 takes on is at the same time remarkable and sad.  They are marching into a slaughterhouse, and they know it.Glory is a film of strong performances, great cinematography, bloody battles, and a fine story of men who fought for freedom.",Glory

88,mOVIemAN56,"Historical Masterpiece, My All Time Favorite Movie",10,26 July 2003,"(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Glory is probably one of the best acted, best filmed Civil War Movies I have ever seen. Glory is mostly about Col. Robert Shaw of the 54th Mass. and some of soldiers. The movie starts going right into the Battle of Antietam and shows how the South was beating the Union down pretty badly. In the battle the Commander of Shaws regiment is killed and Shaw is knocked out from an explosion.The lead is played by Matthew Broderick who completely took me off guard as a lead for a Civil War Drama. Denzel Washington (who received an Oscar for his performance) plays the young hot head Pvt. Trip. Morgan Freeman gives as what I believe is one of his best performances ever as Sgt. Maj. John Rawlins and Cary Elwes (another comedic actor) plays Shaws' (Broderick) second-in-command Maj. Forbes.Glory is not just about war but the fighting of racism between the all African American, former slave regiment and white union officers. Such as the scene during the winter of 1862 when Shaw requests shoes and socks for his seven hundred soldiers and is denied just because the regiment is all-black. Another scene is when Shaw is assigned to accompany an all black regiment into Georgia. While in Georgia the Union Brigade pillages the town and the commander of the brigade says they (African American soldiers) are nothing but animals and you just have to know how to control them.The whole movie is focused on the fight of racism and the first hour is the regiment getting trained under a Irish Sgt. The ending I thought was excellent but sad at some parts such as when Shaw is hit with the mini ball while trying to rally his men at Fort Wagner. Everything in this movie seemed to look real except the ships in front of the Fort. The battles were well done and the acting is amazing. A must see for a Civil War Buff or anyone who just wants to see an amazing movie. 5/5 Stars",Glory
89,luke-a-mcgowan,"Poignant and honest, with Denzel best in show",8,28 March 2016,"1. The experience of watching Glory could be summed up by its music - there is an aching sadness yet a firm sense of patriotism in its soaring choral theme. This is reflected clearly amongst the story of black soldiers fighting for a nation, many of the citizens of which care little for their lives or sacrifice.2. This is poignantly captured by the monologue of Private Trip towards this middle of the film; just one of many stirring moments contained within Kevin Jarre's screenplay. 3. Those words, when delivered by incredible thespians like Morgan Freeman or Denzel Washington, become something very special indeed.4. I took one look at the poster for Glory and saw Matthew Broderick's wimpy facial hair and thought ""this is going to stink"". Fortunately, the story of the rich white kid leading up a black battalion suited someone significantly weedy and Broderick adds considerable dramatic heft to his performance.5. Denzel is best in show as Private Silas Trip. He's a hard, cynical, somewhat belligerent man but underneath there's a man. This comes out most especially in Denzel's strikingly honest performance during the whipping scene and the final words before battle.6. I love juxtaposition, and Ed Zwick does a killer job in the aftermath of the Battle of Antietam. Amid the howls of a man being amputated, Captain Shaw receives treatment for a minor neck wound (being told ""this might hurt"") and is informed of the great victory. With those screams and pleas, the scene is set.7. Zwick superbly balances the film's central themes of acceptance without ever overdoing it. Something as simple as Trip helping Thomas stay on his feet is the pay off to the conflict set up throughout the movie. Where the black men fit in amongst the whites is clear from a scene in which a white officer shoots his own black soldier to protect a white Southern woman who he blames for initiating the incident anyway.8. Rawlins' promotion to Sergeant doesn't feel profound enough because Trip was the one who showed leadership amongst the pay dispute and the shoes issue was only advice in response to something the audience and Shaw already knew.9. The action scenes are dignified but have high stakes. Watching those bayonets come rushing towards you just looks like it hurts. There's some goofy choreography but for the most part the battles feel realistic. The decision (helped by real events, of course) to have several major characters die early in the final fight does a lot to keep the stakes of war in the front of one's mind.10. Glory is over twenty-five years old but it feels younger. I hope that this is a sign that its message about acceptance and brotherhood is both timeless and universal.",Glory
90,SMLA11,Excellent war movie,10,24 May 2002,"Matthew Broderick is awesome as the white leader of the 54th regiment.  The movie is a civil war movie and I've really never seen a war movie like this before.  This is just perfect.  The acting is wonderful, especially from Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington,  Cary Elwes, and Morgan Freeman.  They were all great and they filled their characters with all sorts of potential and left nothing behind of their character.  If they could all win Academy Awards I would be much happier.  At least Denzel Washington won the Best Supporting Actor.Overall this is an absolutely wonderful war movie and I recommend this to anyone who likes war movies or just anyone.

91,ajkbiotech,An important film historically,10,16 April 2021,"Glory is based upon historically true facts.Colonel Shaw's statue graces Boston Common, and. Frederick Douglass was very much as he appears in the film.The entrance of African American troops onto the Union side of the Civil War actually turned the tide, as in 1863 the Confederacy still had a fighting chance, but after the added divisions Grant & Sherman had the manpower to grind down the Confederacy despite Lee and his brilliancy.A very great film from start to end that I re-watch at least annually.",Glory
92,Hancock_the_Superb,Wonderful Telling Of An Important Chapter In American History,9,10 June 2006,"Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), a young officer in the American Civil War, is singled out for heroism at the bloody Battle of Antietam. Promoted to colonel, he is commissioned the commander of the 54th Massachusetts infantry - a regiment made up entirely of black soldiers. With the help of his friend Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes) and a loud-mouthed Irish drill sergeant (John Finn), Shaw whips his recruits into a fine unit. However, he learns that his superior officers - namely crooked department leader General Harker (Bob Gunton) and Colonel Montgomery (Cliff De Young), his racist brigade commander - have no intention of letting his troops into action. However, they finally do get a chance, winning a skirmish with a Confederate patrol and then leading an assault on Fort Wagner, one of the Confederate forts protecting Charleston, South Carolina. The attack fails, Shaw is killed, and over half the regiment with him - but the 54th Massachusetts earns its place in history.If nothing else, ""Glory"" deserves credit for shining the light on one of the most overlooked chapters in American history. While thousands of white men died for the Union in fruitless charges from Fredericksburg to Shiloh, white leaders throughout the North were reluctant to arm blacks, for a variety of reasons - they couldn't fight, they would incite the border states to leave the Union, white soldiers wouldn't allow it - but finally, it occurred. The 54th Massachusetts was not the first black regiment raised, nor was it the first to see combat in the Civil War - but it was arguably the most important. After its attack on Fort Wagner, even the most bigoted white politicians had to admit that blacks were just as good as whites. By war's end over 100,000 blacks were in uniform, and black troops of the Union XXV Corps were the first to enter Richmond after its fall to Union forces in April 1865. This is movie is a perfect tribute to the men of the 54th, and to every black soldier who overcame the odds to prove themselves worthy.The cast is amazing in this film, with Matthew Broderick giving a bravura performance as Shaw. Shaw himself is only in his twenties, but is forced to become the leader of some 700 men, most of them older than him, and train them to be good fighters. Shaw is doggedly determined to prove himself, and other than one or two overlong speeches, Broderick does a marvelous job (despite a ridiculous Boston accent) portraying this heroic figure. Denzel Washington got a well-deserved Oscar for his role as Trip, the bitter black soldier who struggles to find himself while serving in the regiment. Morgan Freeman as usual is amazing as Sergeant Rawlins, the gravedigger-turned-soldier who becomes a father figure to Shaw's ragged men. Jhimi Kennedy and Andre Brougher are also solid as other black soldiers, while Cary Elwes, John Finn, Cliff De Young, Bob Gunton, Jay O. Sanders, Richard Riehle, and Alan North are all fine in supporting roles.Edward Zwick's direction is stellar, catching the feel of Civil War times with splendid detail. The battle scenes are spectacular, with the final assault on Fort Wagner one of the most heart-pounding action scenes in any war movie. Kevin Jarre's screenplay is exceptionally well-written, and a world apart from the more witty script he would write for ""Tombstone"" several years later. And James Horner's haunting score is an instant classic.While it can be argued that the unsuccessful assault on Fort Wagner had little importance to the overall Civil War, it did have massive importance for America's black community and showed that they too had a place not only in the military, but in society as well. ""Glory"" is a fitting tribute to men who are overshadowed by the glories of Gettysburg and Chickamauga, but are just as deserving of recognition for their extraordinary heroism.Nine stars.",Glory

95,oneflewovertheapocalypse,Emotional Rollercoaster,10,28 March 2004,"Every time I see Glory a tear drops from my eye as it is such a tearjerker, especially for a war film.  It's like Dead Poets Society but with guns and it's set in the Civil War.   It's not everyday you'll see Matthew Broderick in a good film, well actually any film come to think of it, but in the 80's he was hot property after Ferris Buller's Day Off, War Games and Project X but Glory was by far his best performance of his career.  Let's remind ourselves though that it just wasn't Broderick who got praise out of this, there was also Morgan freeman, Denzel Washington who thanks to this got his first look at Oscar glory and Cary Elwes.  The music is soaring and the battle scene at the end is one of the most emotional and patriotic scenes I have ever seen and I'm not an American but I don't think it should matter because it makes you feel strong and sucks you into the battle as you are cheering on the soldiers to prove everyone wrong and take the fort.  The only complaint I can say about Glory is that it wasn't long enough.  It did everything to make it as compelling as any other war film but for it to be a real epic I could have done with it being longer but on the DVD there is this deleted scene where the troops are out on patrol one night and they see the enemy on the other side and Red decides to take a shot at one of the soldiers and when he does he gets him in one clean shot.  Red is really happy that he has finally killed an enemy soldier but it turns out to be another soldier in the same regiment.  The only thing telling them apart was he was a white soldier not a black one, but this scene is really important as it shows how Red becomes more emotional and attached the more he spends in the 54.  Throughout the film we see his macho performances and when they go into battle and Thomas saves his life he begins to change his act but the scene where he accidentally kills the soldier is very relevant to the story and should have stayed but the damage has been done, but it still makes Glory the best Civil War film I am yet to see.  I haven't seen Cold Mountain yet so it could beat it but so far Glory is the Bollocks.",Glory
96,Larry41OnEbay-2,From my brief introduction of the film at the Library Of Congress in 2012.,9,30 April 2013,"GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth.And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment.The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.",Glory

Everything appeared authentic and true to the time period.Strong performances turned out by all, particularly Denzel Washington who cuts you to the core in a few scenes.Pure gratitude for those who sacrificed so much to carve out the world we live in today.

99,deadbull-95171,Difficult to add or subtract to the rave reviews,10,30 September 2021,"What else need be said. Among the best of any war movie ever made, and in many ways perhaps the best because the fantastic performances by the principals, create an emotional connection that keeps building.Scored angelically, the final doomed battle, emotionally climaxes an escalating relationship with the film that keeps moving our empathy and engagement in ways that few war movies manage, if any.Apparently, in Wikipedia-reality, bodies of white soldiers were sent home, but Shaw was left in the mass grave with his friends and comrades, not as an honor but as an insult by those in charge, yet his family approved and found it appropriate to be 'guarded for eternity' by those he fell with, and I would agree, as his kind of courage and commitment to ideals hardly exist anymore, to say nothing of the loss of ideals as we move deeper into dehumanization as a species.It's a film mainly geared to a male audience, but not so much because it's about war, and does not focus , really at all, on male/female issues, but because it has to do with issues of brotherhood and the power of men bonded by a common ideal, and war tested that to the ultimate degree.Non-sexual male comradeship's nature is very different the the love between different sexes, not confounded by sexual and biological/psyche complexities, it assumes a 'purer' form, and it's exploration in this film has few parallels in the genre. The family ties that need to be subordinated under the chain of command necessities are always burning, but ooze out in strangles and suppressed ways, that make them more powerful. And this is the case for guys who feel the deepest depths of challenge and emotion but, are obliged by extreme circumstance to remain hard and disciplined.Look, it's just a great movie all around, and by far, in the main , historically accurate. The details that comprise the art of actors that might cause slight deviations, are exactly what we go to movies for, otherwise we may as well read dry as dust meta-factual histories. The fil tries to 'bring to life' things that other records can't do. This one is a huge success.",Glory

101,dkncd,Glorious,9,9 August 2007,"""Glory"" is certainly among the best American Civil War films. It tells the inspiring story of the first all-black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts. The script and cinematography are solid and James Horner's score was eerily appropriate for the film.Matthew Broderick and Cary Elwes, who people may not initially think of as being appropriate for the serious roles they play, are strong as the leaders of the regiment. Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and Andre Braugher represent the soldier side with equal strength. I also enjoyed John Finn's colorful performance as the brutal sergeant-major in charge of training and Bob Gunton and Cliff De Young's performances as the two corrupt Union officers.The only improvement that could have been made to the film is in the battle scenes, particularly the first. A better sense of tactics could have been incorporated into them. However, overall, Glory is an excellent American Civil War film worth seeing.",Glory

This is definitely one of the greatest films ever made about the Civil War.",Glory
103,calspers,Beautiful script despite poor battle scenes,8,25 October 2021,"Glory (1989) is a beautiful film with an authentic plot.Following the Battle of Antietam, Col. Robert Gould Shaw is offered command of the United States' first all-African-American regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. Here, Shaw puts together a strong and proud unit. The story centers on the 54ths rise to glory, who are first limited to manual labor, and later are allowed to fight in the heat of battle.What hits the most is the characters who are both beautifully written and acted by the entire cast. In particular, Freeman and Washington are formidable - both superior to Broderick. Brilliant score by James Horner (in 2009, he almost reused the theme in Avatar).Only caveat is in the execution of the battle scenes and particularly in the unconvincing strategies - or lack thereof. In spite of this minor flaw, the film's beauty lies in the great script and acting. Highly recommended.",Glory

The movie has an excellent cast which includes Mathew Broderick(only three years after he was in Ferris Buellers Day Off), Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman.I first saw this in my eight grade history class when we were learning about the Civil War. This movie has a great score and it really captures the feel of the Civil War through its battle scenes. For those of you who only watch war movies to see people getting their heads blown off, this is the wrong movie for you. This movie focuses on the characters and what they're going through. Despite having a long running time, the result of this movie is an entertaining and well made war movie.You should only buy this movie if you really like it, because it gets a little bit slow the second time you see it.

Denzel Washington won Best Supporting actor for his role and Morgan Freeman and Matthew Broderick just got ripped off. The acting is absolutely wonderful. It captures every bit of the tenacity of the degradation that they faced. It's very convincing and if you are sensitive, you WILL cry when Denzel Washington is whipped on his back. It is one of the most emotional scenes that I have ever scene.The civil war was captured greatly. The battle of Antetiam was extremely graphic and will make you turn away at some points.

109,Hawkensian,Ultimately rather average,6,9 November 2013,"'Glory' charts Colonel Robert Gould Shaw's (Matthew Broderick) appointment to the head of a coloured regiment through to his battles with institutional racism during the American Civil War.As a result of familiarity and the majority of the characters being quite bland, I found Glory's central theme of racism somewhat unremarkable. The flattest characters in the film were the troops of the coloured regiment, who should be central to the film. The problem is they're not, which is an issue. 'Glory' is adapted from Robert Shaw's letters to his mother, meaning the film is naturally focused on him. Consequently, the core subjects of the story are quite underdeveloped.Morgan Freeman gives a very Morgan Freeman performance as John Rawlins, the measured, sensible and wise Sergeant Major, characteristics so typical of Freeman's oeuvres. Denzel Washington is more interesting as Private Trip, an angry runaway slave who's understandably embittered with the world and everyone in it. This anger manifests itself as bullying, he's always provoking people who threaten that chip on his shoulder. His wrath is felt particularly by Corporal Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), an educated, well dressed man whom Trip considers an uncle tom.Trip is a decent character and convincingly played by Washington, he conveys that pain and anger well; his Oscar winning turn is probably the best performance of the film. However Trip is, like the rest of the film, still somewhat unremarkable and overly familiar. There is one scene where Trip remarks how the regiment is 'the only family he's ever had', which is so clichéd and predictable you could see it coming a mile off.What perhaps is worst about the film are the battle scenes. While there's a grisly headshot at the beginning and it succeeds in depicting the disgraceful death of the suicidal battle charges, it ultimately does not convince or affect. There's far too much choreography going on, whether its soldiers exuberantly throwing themselves about under cannon fire or the almost laughable scenes of contrived mêlée where the soldiers run about rifle butting each other like in some second-rate action film.Mark Kermode spoke of how 'Glory' had 'visceral war scenes' that were 'long before Saving Private Ryan'. Indeed, 'Glory' was before 'Saving Private Ryan', but the latter heralded a new level of brutal realism, after its awesome 169 minutes you feel completely battered and depressed. I am very surprised that Kermode would compare this tame piece of work with Spielberg's stark WWII epic.Despite my reservations, I wouldn't say 'Glory' is a bad film, it goes along just fine. Although I thought there should've been more focus on the black characters, it is Shaw's struggle to control and maintain his new regiment that's probably the most interesting part of the film. Although a compassionate man, he realises that he is now an authority figure, he must nurture a veneer of unwavering stoicism and power so the men respect and obey him. This means he must adhere to the rules of the time, including the ugly, violent ones. I was most engaged when watching Shaw wrestle with the officialism and racism of his regiment, however the men he commands are trite and boring.While it may have been more profound in 1989, I felt that the film, although competent, was rather neutered and covered well-trodden ground.",Glory
110,walsh-22,Very emotional film to watch,10,2 August 2007,"I find it sad that no-one really knew about the 54th Maschusetts till this film came out. I certainly had no idea about the 54th and never knew there were black soldiers fighting in the war which to me is shocking. Those soldiers may not have taken Fort Wagner but they were brave and didn't flinch from the duty they volunteered for, no matter the treatment they endured by their own side.The film has many multi-layered strands that are explored in this movie. One, this had never been done before, black soldiers fighting in the war and they had a lot more to prove than the white soldiers. Totally unfair. Two, they had death threats from the Confederate Army who said they would not capture them but kill them on sight. Three, the racism they faced in their own army. The Northerners liked to think they were better than the Southerners because they didn't have slaves and they would never treat them the way the Southerners did but they were just as bad as the South and this is shown in the film when the black soldiers are denied boots, uniforms, they are used for manual labour and don't see any fighting and are given less wages than the white soldiers. Then we have the stories of soldiers where we see them grow into completely different people to when the film started. The actors are in one word, brilliant. I can't stop raving about them. I wouldn't like to say more because I can't put into any other meaningful words how well they fit into the characters.Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) finds himself overwhelmed with the responsibility of getting the men up to the task but at times finds himself doubting his abilities. There has been made mention Broderick's age and acting in this film but he was the perfect actor to play the role. For one, he looks like Shaw and for another, he was about the age Shaw was when he was given command. He plays Shaw just right, not too understated and not too over the top.Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) is the wise man who is like a father figure to the soldiers who rely on him and also Shaw looks to Rawlins for his advice on the men.Trip (Denzel Washington) starts off defiant. He wants to fight in the war but he also is scarred by his past as a slave and doesn't trust Shaw or any other white man. I didn't think I would feel any compassion about him as he is nasty to some of his fellow soldiers but I grew to like him very much and you see a softer side to him near the end when he admits to his fellow soldiers they are the only family he has now. I like to think at the end, he trusted Shaw because he picks up the colours which he said he didn't want to do when asked by Shaw earlier in the film.Thomas (Andre Braugher) is a free black man who has lived in the North for most, if not, all of his life. He has never been a slave but is well educated and finds himself an outsider in the regiment because he has had an easier life then his fellow soldiers but you see him grow up in this film, he starts off as a little boy but by the end of it, he is a man who can face anything.Major Forbes (Cary Elwes) knows that there is no-way the Army will let them fight and you can see how he genuinely cares for these men. He and Shaw find it hard to establish a different type of relationship with Thomas then they are used to as before they were friends.This is a very emotional film to watch. It has many highs and lows and you have these foreboding feelings in the pit of your stomach when Shaw volunteers his men for basically, a suicide mission to Fort Wagner. You know that these men you have watched from the beginning and have rooted for will die and it is hard to watch when it happens. The scene that particularly upsets me is when these brave, courageous soldiers are dead, they are just chucked into a mass grave and the most moving scene for me is when the dead bodies of Trip and Shaw are thrown together in the mass grave. That had me in tears the most.The 54th got praise for what they did at Fort Wagner and after but they were treated very badly, they were not invited to the parades to welcome the soldiers back at the end of the war and there was no help given to them to recover from it either. It does highlight that racism occurred in the military, not just in this war but in other wars before and after the American Civil War where people of different colour were treated as if they were not even human.Love the film but if you're a girl, you will need tissues by your side.",Glory
111,thewillt08,Three Cheers for Glory,9,1 August 2013,"Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the ""N"" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair.Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to Déjà vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well.With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.",Glory

It tells a more interesting story and discusses larger themes in much less time than the other recent Civil War film, Gettysburg.  It deals with issues about the war not seen in many films before.  This film received few Oscar nominations, which is great injustice. It helped make Denzel Washington a star, and showed that director Edward Zwick had great promise.

Glory stands out as a moving yet faithful rendition of an incredible tale from American history. The first time I saw this movie, I had no idea what the movie was about or how it ended. I was deeply moved, and today Glory remains one of those movies that I could rewatch over and over.This movie inspired me to read more about the Civil War. I've also read a little more specifically about the Massachusetts 54th. Other reviews have been quick to point out some historical inaccuracies, but most of these glitches are minor and insignificant. For example, the final charge came from the South, not North, as depicted... but with something tiny like that, who cares?This movie inspires and moves. The details of the screenplay and set are well done. The action and special effects are exciting and absorbing. It's also noteworthy that Glory has one of the most stirring, well suited, well choreographed, and independently enjoyable soundtracks. Broderick, Elwes, Denzel, Freeman, and the rest of the talented cast are outstanding. Even the plot and script are worthy. All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough.As a sidenote, if you enjoyed Glory, go visit the 54th Mass. monument on Boston Common.",Glory
114,vovazhd,A glorious war story,8,28 May 2008,"Glory is truly an effective war film. Set in the American Civil War, it recounts the history of an all-black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment. Obviously a controversial idea at the time, the regiment defies all expectations to play a pivotal role in the war.The characters are a strong point of the film. The cast includes Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The biggest (pleasant) surprise was Matthew Broderick, who does a fantastic job as Colonel Robert Shaw, the commander of the regiment. His personality and style suits the character perfectly. Generally, the cast's actions and dispositions feel historically believable.The plot is fine, although in retrospect it might have been a little too straightforward. Roughly the first half consists of developing and training the regiment. Here we see the racial injustices of the period. The officers have good intentions but are unsure of how to treat the blacks. They slowly gain an understanding of each other. Then they are off to fight together against the Confederates. They see more injustice, but also the opportunity to make a difference. There are only two major battle scenes, but both of them go the distance. The last one is especially well executed, with beautiful special effects and cinematography. The iconic music theme adds a lot to the emotional impact of the film.Glory is a powerful war film. It allows us to accurately experience a tumultuous period in American history. It also reminds us of the crimes of prejudice. It has a clear goal and doesn't wander out of focus like some other war films do.",Glory

But with the extra material, which is the best I've can remember ever have seen, it ranks among the very best. The direction by Edward Zwick, the acting by Morgan Freeman, Matthew Broderick and Denzel Washington, among others. are all top rate, and the story about the 54th Massachusetts is fairly well told, but I must say that the first featurette is almost its equal in intensity and importance, being a very well done historical presentation of what the 54th did though its operating career - that in a way continues to this very day, and some more information about who these men were, their background, et cetera.

116,fleagles,"A breathtaking story of heroism, told beautifully",10,5 May 2000,"A truly breathtaking historical drama.  This film centers around the African-American Massachusetts regiment that became the first to fight in the Union army.  These were men who were only too eager to fight against the hated Confederacy, but who also needed the education to become soldiers.Their leader is Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), who is chosen to manage this `project'.  Cary Elwes is his friend, a major who had a more difficult time adjusting to new troops.  Morgan Freeman plays one soldier who possesses the maturity and leadership for this unit, Andre Braugher (the great Frank Pembleton from `Homicide: Life on the Street') is a free Massachusetts black man who volunteers for the regiment faces some uncomfortable changes both inside and outside himself.  And then there is Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance as one stubborn soldier who is as difficult as can be, but becomes a soldier worthy of his unit.Directed by the brilliant Edward Zwick, Glory features a cast and crew that managed to excel at everything.  James Horner's score mixed with the Harlem Boys Choir's voices, melt with the images on the screen of troops that were ready to sacrifice everything for their cause. Perhaps above all is Freddie Francis' cinematography.  His photography, whether of battle, the troops themselves, or the overall atmosphere of war, brings the audience into this film with a spirit that is rare.There have always been some grumblings about Broderick as the choice to play an Army Colonel, but he plays Shaw with maturity and poise.  The rest of the cast are all terrific, and all deliver excellent performances.This is truly a film to watch again and again, to see the horrors of the Civil War, and the heroism of African-Americans ready for battle, and the bravery of the white leaders that led them there.Vote: 10",Glory
117,Danimal-7,Simply the finest war movie ever made.,10,20 August 1999,"Edward Zwick brings us the story of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first regiment of the Civil War comprised entirely of black volunteers. The story centers around a group of black soldiers.  There's Trip, a cynical, bitter runaway slave (Denzel Washington); Rawlins, a wise and compassionate grave-digger who can no longer stand aside and watch others die to save his people (Morgan Freeman); Sharts, a devoted and naive young sharpshooter (Jihmi Kennedy); and Thomas, a well-educated free Northerner who in his own way is no less naive than Sharts (Andre Braugher).  All will grow and change in the course of the movie.  Col. Shaw (Matthew Broderick) is the white commander of the regiment who must win the trust of men who have known nothing but contempt and hatred from whites, while simultaneously putting them through the often-cruel process of training for battle.There are two movies that, even if I walk into them in the middle, will immediately glue me to the screen until the very end.  One is CASABLANCA. The other is GLORY.  This movie is pure drama without an ounce of fat on it. There's not a single shot, much less a single scene, that should have been edited out.Any discussion of GLORY must begin with Denzel Washington.  Arguably the greatest American actor living today, Washington has yet to surpass his astonishing performance as Trip.  Washington's role calls for a wide variety of emotions, all of which he delivers outstandingly: hatred and sourness that he cannot resist spilling onto his fellow soldiers, defiance and determination in the incredibly powerful scene where he is disciplined for desertion, an embarrassed affection as he realizes, and confesses, that his comrades mean the world to him.  Washington's Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor was hardly reward enough; the Academy could have renamed the award in his honor.Morgan Freeman is dignified and reserved throughout, as he transforms from bystander in the war to the leader-by-acclaim and the surrogate father of the troops.  His confrontation with Washington is classic.  Andre Braugher evokes great sympathy as, due to his comfortable upbringing, he suffers much worse than his fellows from the hardships of soldiering, yet refuses to give up.  Matthew Broderick, normally a mediocre actor at best, gives a sterling performance; one scene, where he takes the regiment in five seconds from the verge of mutiny to being ready to follow him through hell, should be shown in every ROTC course on military leadership.But GLORY is not a mere feel-good piece of sugar candy like, say, A TIME TO KILL.  These characters we come to know and love have to fight a very dirty, nasty, bloody war, and GLORY does not flinch from showing it to us.  War does not play favorites with our favorite characters.  Nor is the Union side portrayed as angelically just.  Indeed, most of the racism that the men of the 54th Mass. must endure comes from their bigoted fellow Union soldiers, and Shaw's superiors are realistically shown as corrupt and indifferent to the welfare of their subordinates.It is an interesting irony that Washington went on to play Spike Lee's Malcolm X, where he famously declares to his fellow black people, ""We are not Americans!""  Having seen GLORY, and having gained some understanding of how bitter was the sacrifice, how bloody the price, that the men of the 54th Mass. paid to win themselves and their fellows the rights that Americans today take for granted, one hopes that fewer Americans of any race will agree with the jaded view of the great civil rights leader.  As a paean to the courage of those who would rather die free than live as slaves, GLORY surpasses even BRAVEHEART, due to GLORY's superior acting and far greater historical accuracy.  Zwick, Washington, Freeman and Broderick have given us a true classic.",Glory
118,Ed-from-HI,Essential history of authentic Courage and struggle for dignity & respect (Denzel Washington +Morgan Freeman = Amazing!),10,21 June 2019,"'Glory' is a great, essential (and historically important) Film = it should really be required viewing for anyone interested in having a better more complete understanding of all-facets of the Civil War, and is one of the very few movies to actually give deeper insights into the thoughts & opinions of African American soldiers + and of course highlighting the little known fact that there even existed all-black fighting units (specifically the 54th Volunteer Regiment/Infantry from Massachusetts) within the larger Union-Army, whose participation & boundless-courage might have actually contributed to 'turning-the-tide' ultimately in favor of the Union.Edward Zwick deserves much credit for expertly directing this (he also did the great movie about Jewish partisans in WWII called ""Defiance"" and also ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Blood Diamond' and the Bobby Fischer biography ""Pawn Sacrifice"")Of course it is the intensely-complex multi-layered charismatic performance by Denzel Washington as 'Trip' who agrees to serve in the Union Army under the command of the young abolitionist-leaning 'Robert Shaw' (played by Matthew Broderick) that is the center-piece of this great film. The ex-slave, now Union-soldier Trip's internal (and external) struggles are portrayed in exceedingly realistic manner, of course he will fight relentlessly to ensure that the Union defeats the segregationist-Confederates - but he is not altogether sure that a Victory will ever ensure a significantly better quality-of-Life (and true equality) for his people and bring genuine 'unity' to the entire Country (since he encounters the trappings of racism on both sides) And Morgan Freeman gives superlative-assist as the older-wiser-humane 'Sergeant Major John Rawlins'This is an authentically super-gifted Thespian Cast = completely up to the task of telling the harrowing tale of courageous 54th Infantry Black soldiers sacrificing their very Lives fighting alongside the Union Army and taking immense casualties in the process* - with the faint hopes that winning the Civil-War will improve the quality of everyday lives for themselves and their Loved-ones and bring permanent 'unity' to the entire Nation - but as honestly portrayed in this essential-historic film, struggles against blind-racism with valiant acts of courage to regain dignity & respect - proved to be an uphill (and ongoing) battle.An Essential Movie-Classic (if there ever was one!)note: the valiant all-Black 54th Volunteer Infantry/regiment suffered nearly 50% casualty-rate, but their courageous acts inspired subsequently much larger participation of black soldiers in the Union Army (possibly turning the tide of the Civil-War in the Union's favor)note2*: the incredible courage and sacrifice of the 54th Volunteer Infantry of Massachusetts made me think of the equally courageous & exceedingly valiant 100th Battalion (and 442nd) from WII comprised of all Japanese American volunteers (many of whose family-members were imprisoned in internment-camps during WWII), but who nonetheless willingly gave the ultimate sacrifice to the land in which they were born (hoping that their families would be treated as fully respected American-citizens once the War was over = there are definite parallels to both Essential historical-factual stories that shouldn't be forgotten)",Glory
119,r-fronimides,Rare masterpiece!,9,1 January 2021,"I'm not American, I'm Greek.
Although, I'm a ""History Freak"" and I love reading about History, any kind, any nation. One of the most fascinated story is the American Civil War. I was always reading a lot books about it, trying to find out the real reasons of the conflict.Obviously wasn't the liberation of the black folks.
The North also had many thousands black slaves or servants in North rich houses, while they also have million of ""slaves"" as workers with pitiful salaries in the North's factories. (Not mentioning the thousands immigrates - mostly Irish - that they didn't had step on NY's docks and instantly they've been listed and heading to the South to fight the ""Rebels"", most of the time FIGHTING THEIR OWN IRISH BROTHERS - when they were fighting with the Confederacy)...
...The real reason was the POWER, as always is in any war.
The North wanted to be the powerful part of the Union, the South knew they could be interdependent without the need of the North as ""rulers"" over their shoulders.Now... about the film. It portraits the FIRST colored Regiment of United States' Army. The 54th was the first Regiment Lincoln approved to be form, because the North had great lack of men, they were suffering great defeats (the South had only major victories the first years of the war), he ""had"" to liberate the black people and he agreed to form a colored Regiment.That 54th Regiment was the ""pilot"" of the many more regiments they were about to be form after their bravery into the battlefield. As ""pilots"", these 54th's men were over-brave that then usual. They thought themselves (and rightful so) all the nation has their eyes fixed on them; and it was true. All people waiting to see if this regiment will be successful or not.
So, these FIRST black soldiers gave their best - and much more!The film portraits very poetic, very emotional, quite very accurate (since we have a lot real letters of Colonel Shaw, writing with details about them). and we have amazing actors for this film's casting.Although I was always with the South's side - I like people they want their independence/freedom - this film is one AMAZING rare ""gem"", a rare masterpiece.",Glory

122,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: 'Glory',8,28 October 2014,"""Give 'em Hell, 54!"" ""Give 'em Hell, 54!"" 'Glory' (1989) was certainly a new threshold in historical film archives providing the fact that it was really the first serious American movie about the Civil War to be made in years. It seemed that almost everything else prior had been nonsense or had used the war peripherally. But does the actual film itself truly capture the essence of the horrors of the Civil War had wrought, along with the horrors of racial prejudices and hate during that certain era? Let's take a look. The film opens in the year of 1862 on September 17th, just before the Battle of Antietam in Maryland. We hear a voice-over of a young twenty-three year old Bostonian captain, reading aloud as he writes to his mother. A few particles of his letters are also read aloud to him sporadically throughout the film after intense moments. Sooner than he had ever expected, he would eventually become colonel of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, leading an entire army of willing African-American men into battle, despite the heated bigotry of the time.The film stars wonderful actors, such as Matthew Broderick with his portrayal of the captain-turned-colonel Shaw was indeed a triumph and an emblem of hope against racism to the men in his entire battalion. The enlisted black men, some other main characters, include Denzel Washington (in an Oscar-winning role) who plays Private Silas Trip. Andre Braugher portrays a spectacled but very proper, Boston born-and-bred young black man, also an intellectual. Other characters include Morgan Freeman as gravedigger John Rawlins, who is the regiment philosopher of the film and eventually becomes a sergeant major. And then there is the shy, stuttering Private Jupiter Shats played by Jihmi Kennedy. Their being in the military ranks defies not only heroism but taking a stand against racism for the country that cruelly rejects them, even to the death.In discussing the history portrayed, it tells the viewer that it was once a time forty years before the end of the nineteenth century America where African-Americans were looked down upon and shunned because of their background or valued as nothing more than property nonetheless. When Col. Shaw agreed to accept the responsibility of leading the first ever army of African-Americans into battle, rejection was the first thing he was concerned about. He knew that these men wanted to fight and defend their country as well as any other man would have. No matter what the prejudices and despite the racial barriers that saturated their every day existence would soon diminish into the power of one race to prove that any man, no matter what his background or where he came from, can truly go the distance to the fullest extent.In prevailing attitudes/prejudices that were noticeable, in fact very noticeable, would be the racial slurs, references and a heavy dose of the notorious ""n"" word that slathered the speech of practically every topic of African-American race. One example of racial condemnation would be when the recruits are working outside in the heat of the day and some passing white soldiers stop to watch them. Some of the main characters in the regiment stop working and approach them. When a soldier lashes out a racial comment, push comes to shove until it is broken up and the white troops march on. As they leave, some yell out vulgar racial obscenities referring to the recruits doing black jobs instead of fighting as white men should. Another example would be when the African-American recruits are even mean to each other in the base camp at night, one calling his fellow comrade the ""n"" word several times over. How they treated even those among them was truly deplorable.In describing historical accuracy, it probably comes as close as to how battles in the Civil War era were fought back in the day. The opening bloody Battle of Antietam in the beginning of the film as men were filled with spitting bullets and gunfire raining down on them was very realistic indeed amidst the anguished cries of death. Another epic and graphic scene was where Shaw charged with the 54th Massachusetts Regiment in a spectacular and even bloodier assault on Fort Wagner at the mouth of Charleston Bay on the afternoon and evening of July 18th, 1863. Cannons roared, blowing men to bits in the sand dunes, chocking the beach air with the thick smog of war.My overall reaction towards this film is that its directional debut by Edward Zwick is one of his best. His prowess and display of the wave of racial segregation amidst a world of war are as only he can portray them. The film was indeed worth watching for the two hours it ran. Some parts made me both sad and angry, including one of the film's least effective sequences with a raid on the tiny South Carolina village of Darien, during which Shaw was forced to succumb in following the orders by a superior officer to order his men to plunder and set fire to all the buildings. Another scene was where the 54th Massachusetts Regiment is reduced to be payed ten dollars a month, out of which three dollars would be withheld for clothing. White troops received thirteen dollars a month, plus a three dollar clothing allotment. Also, Shaw's black troops are further discriminated when their feet become blistered from drills in various weather conditions and are refused of getting any good shoes. It is assumed however that they will never see battle anyway.With Oscar-winning cinematography captured by Freddie Francis, the film making was excellent at showing the various emotions of each character. I believe Zwick chose to name his film as he did to compare and contrast overcoming racial tensions to blossom amidst the ugliness of war the soldiers fought for to earn respect and civility. That alone is a glory in and of itself.",Glory
123,EyeDunno,Denzel Washington's defining role.,9,3 July 2013,"I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War ""must-see"" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. ""Trip,"" his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: ""We men, ain't we?"" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and ""Searles"" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.",Glory

Denzel Washington earned an Oscar, though Matthew Broderick, Jihmi Kennedy, Andre Braugher and the always outstanding Morgan Freeman also deserved kudos for their performances.But to me, ""Glory"" will be best remembered for what all great movies are remembered: its scenes. And there are a number of memorable ones, starting near the beginning of the movie, when gravedigger Freeman asks Broderick's injured character if he's all right. The growing admiration of the officer for his men is revealed in several other scenes, such as when Broderick tears up his paycheck in front of the complaining black soldiers who have just been told they are receiving less pay than their white counterparts. Broderick is reluctantly forced to order a lashing of Washington's character, only to be confronted with the view of healed whip marks on the escaped slave's back. This is powerful. The campfire gospel praise meeting the evening before the soldiers are to march to almost certain death is moving, and further lends breadth to the characters, especially Washington's. And the symbolism is perfectly played in the scene prior to the final battle, when the colonel dismounts his horse, putting him on the same level as his black soldiers.

Glory depicts one of the few wars that was truly about freedom. Had the south triumphed it is very possible that I would not be here writing this comment. Glory is a great film because it shows the ugliness and beauty of the human spirit. It shows the true reality of war with no sugar coated ending. I desperately hoped that somehow the 54th had triumphed only to see the smoke clear and the confederate flag being raised. That is what war is about, the good guys do not always win. I understand that Robert Gould Shaw was the only character from the 54th that was in the film. Matthew Broderick's portrayal of this character was excellent. The other characters were excellent because simply they are true to life. Morgan Freeman the wise one, Andre Braugher the educated one and Denzel Washington the ignorant one even to the point of picking fights with a fellow black soldier.

131,Vishal_s_kumar,"We fight for men and women whose poetry is not yet written, but which will presently be as enviable and renowned as any.",9,9 September 2009,"Though the American Civil War has not spawned the same number of classic films as either World War II or the Vietnam Conflict, Director Edward Zwick's moving, important, and expertly-assembled 1989 film Glory finds its message and setting in the midst of the bloodiest conflict in American history. Though the winner of three Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actor (Denzel Washington), Best Cinematography, and Best Sound, neither the film, its director, nor its composer earned nominations, both the Best Picture and Best Music, Original Score nomination snubs perhaps two of the great injustices in the history of the award. Not only a well-made film from a technical perspective, Glory takes audiences on a moving spiritual and emotional journey that sees the corruption, repression, and prejudices of the day breed not contempt or hatred but rather a bond among men with not the color of their skin their defining attribute but rather their moral code, spiritual foundation, and unwavering desire for equality not only in the safe haven of their tents but on the front lines of combat.Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), a 23-year-old U.S. Army Captain and survivor of the Battle of Antietam, accepts an appointment to lead the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first unit to be comprised of black soldiers. With the new position elevating him to the rank of Colonel, Shaw oversees a band of eager yet unskilled men determined to fight. They include Shaw's longtime friend and intellectual, Thomas (Andre Braugher); a levelheaded man named John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman); the smooth-talking Tennessean, Trip (Washington); and the sharpshooting Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy). With the help of his friend, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes) and a hard-nosed Irish drill instructor (John Finn), the regiment becomes skilled and disciplined in the ways of modern warfare but are prohibited the tools and necessities needed to carry out their duty as soldiers thanks to both politics and bigotry. Among their obstacles are reduced pay and a shortage of adequate footwear. Nevertheless, Shaw's determination, family's stature, and leadership sees the men through, culminating in earning them the privilege of facing the enemy head-on and proving their worth as both soldiers and men.Thematically, Glory is a triumph despite plot developments that lend to it an air of tragedy. The film uses tragedy to accentuate the plight of oppression and prejudice; to highlight the absolute good of the men and their mission; and to reinforce the bonds of brotherhood that develop by film's end, where a man's skin color, education, or other artificial social and political boundaries blur in favor of trust, belief, courage, and loyalty to both one another and to a greater cause. Whether at the end of the lash or in the face of impossible odds against a well-fortified enemy, the film's most agonizing, depressing moments serve to reinforce the positive themes of courage and equality, lending to both the film and its themes not insincere drama but rather an honest and profound portrayal of true heroism against a backdrop that sought only to deny the men the very opportunities for which they so valiantly wish to fight and, if need be, die.Glory strives not to entertain, preach, or inform, but rather to tell an uplifting, important story that not only documents a slice of American history but also sets out to inspire its audience to learn the value of courage, integrity, and brotherhood in the face of any obstacle. The film delivers a stirring recount of the power of basic human principles that, when championed, win perhaps not the day but, ultimately, influence the greater good through example. The men of the 54th Massachusetts are remembered not necessarily for the color of their skin but rather for their bravery, for their ability to unite, for their desire to strive for something greater than the individual, to face head-on enemies on either side of the rifle barrel only in the hope of overcoming life-inhibiting obstacles. Neither the color of their skin nor whether they live or die matters; it is their understanding of fundamental human principles, of their desire for good, of their unwavering spirit, for which history remembers them, and by which Glory positively succeeds as a film, for it captures not the superficialities of skin color but rather the underlying principles of the men who fought not as individuals but as brothers that makes their story so profound and important even some 150 years later.Bringing the film and its meaning to life are a series of phenomenal performances on either side of the camera. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning role both electrifies and pulls the heartstrings, his character representing the core of the film as a man that seems to be in control of his person and place in the world but whose soul is as wayward as any man's in the regiment. Throughout the course of the film, his character sees several transformations, beginning as a man that cowers from his past and demons by belittling his peers, growing into a man that understands the role of honor and responsibility but unsure of his role in accepting it, and maturing into a stalwart man that exemplifies courage and honor. One of the film's best scenes sees his character, Private Trip, steady a shaky and fearful Private Thomas moments before an assault on a fortified enemy position, marking his final turning point from a recalcitrant and confused man to a dependable and strong brother-in-arms. The film also features several standout performances both among both the primary cast -- Matthew Broderick, Cary Elwes, Morgan Freeman, Jihmi Kennedy, and Andre Braugher -- and the secondary players -- Bob Gunton, Cliff De Young, and Richard Riehle. Last, but certainly not least, is James Horner's remarkable score. Horner's effort here completes the film. Combining a militaristic refrain with angelic notes, the track fully supports the themes of the film, adding the finishing touches to the drama and meaning of the picture.",Glory

I believe this was a good account of what black soldiers faced in the civil war. The scenery goes well with the movie and the main characters have good development.

133,AppleBlossom,Well worth your time,9,25 March 2005,"This is the story of Col. Robert G. Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and the 54th Massachusetts Coloured Infantry, one of the first black regiments to see action in the Civil War. The production values to 'Glory' were extremely well done in all areas. The acting was faultless, leading and supporting cast showed continuity throughout the film. Matthew Broderick's role sometimes irked me because I suppose he was young and unprepared of his leadership. Several times in the film his position was tested, he had to prove himself and stand firm on his commands which at times seemed naive and harsh. As the film progressed, you saw his character become stronger with the help of his black mentor John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman). The first time I watched this film I know I judged his character unfairly, watching it again I found a more subtle and hidden meaning to his personality.The script enables some very convincing characterizations, especially for the four main African/American actors. The story is based on notes written by Col. Shaw himself.he tells of the racial bigotry on both sides. Unfortunately, as most Hollywood films go not all of the storyline is correct; apparently Col. Shaw didn't write about 4 bonded friends. Nevertheless, the main focus should be on the event and the men who participated in the Civil War and for those who gave their lives in the hope of freedom. Quite a realistic film, 'Glory' might not display the level of impact as some of it's predecessors .but it serves as an account to which certain men are prepared to give ""their all"" for what they believe in. 'Glory'(to me) was a film not just about war but a deeper meaning between men who bonded and gave themselves dignity and pride, a self-worth in the face of adversity and possible death. The adversities these men had to overcome were many, basic requirements the average (white) soldier would take for granted. For instance shoes, uniform, equal pay..every possible avenue Col. Shaw took, he was faced with resistance to assist his infantry. Even the absurd order which was passed down to deter the men even further, saying any coloured prisoner of war caught would be put to death and any white officers leading an infantry of coloured soldiers would meet the same fate. The Union whether or not it took their plot seriously had no intention to allow a black infantry to participate in any battles. Col. Shaw (in his quiet demeanour) persuaded/blackmailed his fellow officers to permit his regiment the right to fight. Hypocrisy was certainly rife in the ranks of the Union, did the attitudes of the South herald somewhat in the hearts of most white men of both sides???The final battle scene shows the determination and strength these men had within.and their conviction to themselves and to their fellow man. I took particular interest in the final footnotes after the film had finished. The notes capped off the final scene to say; the 54th had lost over half it's numbers in the assault on Fort Wagnerthe Fort was never taken. As word spread of their bravery, Congress at last authorized the raising of black troops throughout the Union, over 180,000 volunteered. President Lincoln credited these men of colour with helping turn the tide of war. Makes you wonder who actually was the enemy..the Union, the South or both?For me 'Glory' rates.8.5/10.",Glory
134,Ryan_9,Indeed glorious!,10,4 December 2020,"I loved Glory. I thought it was an awesome civil war movie and well made! Terrific acting all around from Matthew Broderick (Col. Robert Shaw), Morgan Freeman (Sgt. John Rawlins), Denzel Washington (Pvt. Trip), Andre Braugher (Cpl. Thomas Searles), and Cary Elwes (Maj. Cabot Forbes). Washington and Freeman portray their characters the best, but I feel like Matthew Broderick deserves more credit. This was the first serious role I saw him in, and he nailed it. This showed me he could do a lot more besides Ferris Bueller. Each character developed great and formed interesting relationships too.The music score was brilliant as it fit the tone of the film and was emotional. I see why it won an Oscar for best sound mixing. The Boys Choir of Harlem did a stellar job singing. The cinematography was excellent, and I see it won the Oscar for that category as well.I thought the Battle of Fort Wagner was amazingly done. Everything about it was perfect, from the acting, dialogue, music, camera angles, and suspense. The shock from everyone when Shaw gets shot and Trip runs up to grab the flag and does a war cry was very emotional. The ending was sad, but they went out like heroes and made a difference. I didn't know much about the 54th Massachusetts or the Battle of Fort Wagner before, so I was glad to learn a lot from watching this.Overall, I'll give Glory a 10/10. Indeed a glorious movie!",Glory

You know the details, and if you've read the reviews you know about the historical inaccuracies. That to me takes nothing away from this movie. I would rather see a hundred movies where the insignias weren't right with this kind of humanity and emotion than one so-called 'historically accurate' drama like ""Gettysburg"" that recorded the events but missed the fear, the passion, the individual actions that make up a battle or a campaign. If you want the facts, read a book.  I'm sure the 54th wasn't totally keen on charging the fort. But they did. And that's what this movie is about, that's what ""Glory"" really means: one finds glory not in doing what is correct or expedient, but in doing what is right when it is right to do so, no matter what the personal (being killed in battle) or social (being threatened with execution for leading black soldiers) consequences.  Maybe if schools spent more time showing and discussing historical dramas such as this and less time trying to be vo-tech institutes, violence wouldn't seem as glamorous or fascinating to the younger generations.

The fact that it's in the top 250 is laughable.The head-explosion in the beginning was pretty decent. The characters were pretty forced and unbelievable. The Dread Pirate Roberts guy is a decent actor. Ferris Bueller wasn't.The fake mustache was hilarious. I was confused for awhile and thought he was wearing a disguise or something. I thought there was some secret plot where he was a 17 year old kid who took the identity of some Civil War colonel. Nope, they really did try to pass off the look.Morgan Freeman was the only person who made this movie watchable. He's cool, like ice cold for the first two hours. Then there's this weird prayer session around a campfire where he turns into a raging lunatic. Someone must've snuck some crack into his collard-greens or something. (Not a racist joke, this is what they were rationed back then) Denzel Washington plays the same character he plays in every movie. ""Y'all are racist! Kill whitey!"" The battle scenes were pretty archaic and funny, though that is a fair depiction of what old-world-European-style-warfare is. Walk up to each other in horizontal lines and fire your weapons. The looks on the confederate's faces when they saw a wave of eyes and teeth coming at them in the night was pretty hilarious.I'm no racist.

141,supah79,The definition of a classic: Glory,9,14 December 2006,"The story of the 54th.Although I think that the makers lended themselves a big dramatic freedom, this film feels real and human. It's sentimental and sometimes corny, but for the most part this is a very powerful film that says something about duty, honor, equality and comradery. I still can't believe that Shaw didn't have more resistance from within the regiment or that the regiment was this obedient. But perhaps in different times... And off course all the black soldiers of the 54th are even balanced, disciplined and ready to fight (with the exception of Trip). Not disgruntled, traumatized or even angry at the people who enslaved them or stood by as they were.The battle scenes are now somewhat outdated (warmovies after 1989 raised the bar significantly) but they are still powerful and do the job. But the emotionally charge comes from the actors (who work from a very good script) although the film could have sunk if the dialogue was handled by lesser actors. Even Elwes shows us he can act. But off course Freeman and Washington steal the film.Despite my critique, I watched this with a constant lump in my throat.

143,kmberger,"The best Civil War movie, period.",9,20 November 2002,"'Glory' is, without a doubt, the best film ever made about the Civil War. Granted, it has its issues with historical accuracy and does highlight patterns and events within the war that weren't as important as the uninformed viewer might think.  Other comments on this movie have pointed out, quite correctly, that the Civil War was not wholly fought over slavery, that the makeup of the 54th was more upper-class and educated than runaway slaves, and other minor issues that separate 'Glory' from something like Ken Burns' documentary work.Quite frankly, these errors are irrelevant to creating a great, sweeping epic of a film such as 'Glory'.  The ideals here are not in reproducing historical fact; they are in creating an image of an all-black regiment serving in a war that is now more noted for its social impact than its economic roots.  This is the story of the black man's role in the Civil War - a story that shows men of all colors battling for their ideals, showing the same courage, bonding under the same stress, and giving their lives the same way.  This is a film that is now shown regularly in history classes and rightly so; very few films have captured the sense of war so brilliantly. 'Saving Private Ryan' does such for World War II; 'Glory' is the picture of record for the Civil War.It's filmed beautifully, as cinematographer Freddie Francis took home a number of awards, including the Oscar, for his portrayals of the various battles.  Best of all is the final struggle at Fort Wagner, the bittersweet pinnacle of the 54th and a tearjerking dramatic display no matter how many times you've seen it.  It's simply a wonderful scene mixing drama, confusion, bravery and violence and offers an empathic look into the experiences of these soldiers.The acting all around is superb, as Denzel Washington turns in an intense performance that netted him a Supporting Actor Oscar.  He's hardened and defiant; best shown in the whipping scene where he never flinches - only a tear runs down his cheek, no matter how many ugly scars line his body.  A powerful performance.  All the actors seem to consider this film, and their roles in it, of utmost importance; as if the story they are telling desperately -needs- to be heard.  Morgan Freeman and Andre Braugher as other soldiers, and Matthew Broderick as Shaw don't hold anything back. 
'Glory' is an emotionally-charged film that never sugarcoats the harsh realities of war, but also highlights the bravery and fortitude of the men that fought it.  Historical errors and dramatic compromises aside, this is a wonderful film that illustrates the Civil War and its devastation unlike any film before it.",Glory

It was just another boring day at school sitting in my history class drawing random drawings in my notebook. Suddenly my teacher says we're going to watch a movie. I wake up from my dreamy state and I decide I'll give it a chance. He loads the VCR tape into the machine and I fix my eyes upon the screen.I will put ""Glory"" into a few words--this is what every war movie strives to be and beyond. Glory tells the story of a Civil War colonel (Matthew Broderick) who leads the war's first all-black volunteer regimen into battles and discovers along the way he has to confront the moral question of racial prejudice within, and outside of, his regimen.So as I'm sitting in history class watching ""Glory,"" I immediately begin to perk up. From the explosive first scene, I was fully awake. My luck skyrocketed when I discovered two of my all-time favorite actors in the film, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The movie progressed and I found myself becoming yet more and more drawn into the film--not just watching it, but actually EXPERIENCING every ounce of war, prejudice, and moral questions that face the characters in the movie.What's even more, is that you find yourself becoming attached to ALL of the characters--every single black soldier--in some strange way, so strange, that when these men fall in battle you feel a jolt of power inside of you that is converted to emotional sadness in your mind.The final scenes in Glory are mesmerizing. No, more than that--utterly spectacular. The final battle scene at Fort Wagner is so amazingly shot you will think you're actually there fighting along with the black regimen. You're not in your seat watching the film--you feel like you're there! The final battle scene is so spectacular, it will easily remain one of the most memorable battle scenes I've ever witnessed in all of film. After watching Glory, you will find yourself truly moved in all ways possible. You will almost feel like a new person.All of this paired with a beautiful score by James Horner, Glory is simply one of the best war movies of all-time.

It is a war film in which perhaps only fifteen minutes of its nearly two hour running time is used to recreate battle scenes. Instead of blasting its audience with carnage and bloodshed, we get to know the men who were involved in these battles and their reasons for fighting. Glory is a film of great depth and subtlety in which powerfully dramatic moments are depicted with very little dialogue. Edward Zwick, the director, obviously understands that an audience has intelligence enough to be completely moved by a sudden swell of music or by a single tear running down a man's cheek. The performances by all five of the main protagonists are astonishing, the cinematography is sublime and the score is beautifully used throughout the film.The story of the 54th Regiment is emotive and inspiring and Glory is an emotive and inspiring film that pays tribute to all those men who died in the fight for freedom.",Glory

151,tfclougher,The youth and class of Colonel Shaw,10,28 January 2011,"I did research on Robert Gould Shaw. His greatgrandfather formed Gouldsboro, Maine, with Robert Gould and one other. Mr. Shaw was a merchant in Boston. Two of his sons settled in Maine, dying in their forties. One was the grandfather of Robert Gould Shaw. His family moved to Staten Island and Robert at age 12 did a miserable stint at St. John's College, West Hills Farms, Westchester, the future Fordham University, The Bronx, New York. After one year there, he travelled with his family through Europe, being taught by tutors. In 1856, he entered Harvard University, graduating in 1860. The family still lived on Staten Island, NY, and the censuses for 1840, 1850 and 1860, show several servants.The South saw hypocrisy in the North. Immigrant labor was exploited for cheap labor and unions were suppressed. The term ""wage slavery"" was applied by slave owners to this Northern aberration. The household servants were certainly well-treated and cherished. But their Irish, German and Polish relatives lived in slums and exploded in 1863 in the Draft Riots. Their people were fighting for the black man whom they saw as competitors for their jobs. This competition was used by the upper classes to maintain their profits. It was their homes that were ransacked during the Riots. It was New York militia men who put down the rioters after returning from Gettysburg. Irish killing Irish.The war was a fight for freedom. The fight continued after for everybody.Blacks and poor whites were held back in the South, and Labor in the North was seen as a threat. The fight goes on even today with different immigrants. But instead of cheap labor coming here, companies find it in the Third World.Unmentioned is Andre Braugher who played the bookish intellectual soldier whom Denzel Washington picked on. The moderate, thinking brains of the future offset by the impulsive, reactive orator goading people to action. Two sides of a movement. John Finn was the Irish drill sergeant who called the troops ""ye bloody Hindoos"". Shaw wanted discipline and pride in the ranks, and his sergeants hammered it into them.",Glory

Duty is foremost to men who will fight for not only their own freedom, but others. The cast is first rate, Matthew Broderick perfectly portrays the idealistic Colonel Shaw, Cary Elwes is excellent as Col. Shaw's friend and second in command, who knows when to rein in his friend, Morgan Freeman is, as usual, excellent as Sgt Major Rawlins and Denzel Washington brings fire to Tripp, a performance that won him a well deserved Oscar. Jhimy Kenedy is very good as sharp-shooting Pvt Shartes, and the excellent Andre Braugher is, of course, excellent as Shaw's friend, Thomas Searles, who grows as the film progresses. The action starts with the battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day of American history. Shaw is slightly wounded and stunned. After the battle, he meets John Rawlins who is a gravedigger. Shaw goes back to Massachusetts where he is offered the command of the 54th Mass regiment, a ""Colored"" unit. Overcoming his and Forbes's doubts they begin to form their command. They bring in Sgt Major Mulcahy (John Finn in a fine performance) to whip the recruits into a fighting unit. He also literally whips Tripp, after he's arrested for desertion. The troops learn that they won't get full pay and tear up their pay slips rather than accept the lower pay. They receive their rifles and uniforms and are assigned to a sadistic and crooked General in South Carolina, but they don't really fight, just terrorize defenseless civilians, while the general and his colonel double deal and loot the surrounding area. Shaw and Forbes confront the crooks and get the 54th transferred to a combat command. They go into the line and are bloodied but hold their ground, turning back two Confederate attacks. Their next assignment is to attack Fort Wagner, a coastal fort. The 54th charges across the beach, but are halted before the defenses and wait under fire for darkness to continue their assault. The fort is well set up for repelling attacks and they get to a moat, where they're again stopped. Shaw gets up and starts up the embankment only to be shot, Tripp picks up the flag and follows, but he's also killed. The rest of the 54th surges forward and gains ground, but comes upon Confederate cannon that blasts them into eternity. The epilogue tells us that all the attackers suffered huge losses, and the fort was never taken. ""Glory"" is a unit tribute, like ""Go For Broke"", ""The Fighting 69th"" or ""Battleground"". Except for Shaw, the major characters are fictional. There's the wise old sarge, eager beaver klutz, tough guy who comes around, young sharp shooter who's never killed a man and the tough drill sergeant. Themen pull together into a unit, putting aside their differences for the greater good. In all aspects, this is a great movie, with great acting, cinematography and a score that's often heard on commercials and sometimes to advertise other films. If you're a Civil War buff, you've probably already seen it, if not, what are you waiting for?",Glory

Except that this is no Earnest movie! Thank God! If it's on tv, ""Glory"" that is, I have to watch it, it's simply  that compelling to me. I can find no weaknesses in this movie(though I'm sure some will/would contest it's historical accuracy, but who cares about that?), from the music to the cinematography, to Zwick's great vision to what I believe is to be the best performances of Broderick, Freeman, & Washington(that says a lot for Freeman & Washington, but as for Broderick this is much easier to say, unless someone out there thinks he deserves an ""Oscar"" for his rendition of ""Inspector Gadget""?)and to a fantastic story of race, honor, and our country's history.

It has something so universal about it, it speaks so simply and openly of our humanity, our conscience and our history as a race, that it pulled me in from the beginning.
What made me stay though was Denzel Washington's performance. It was excellent in every way: deep, grasping, powerful and moving to the core. I was in awe of him - he was impeccable in every scene and made the movie shine, gave it the strength, the oomph it needed to be a memorable piece.",Glory

Why does every movie have to resort to them? Emotion is to be portrayed as is, doesn't need all this theatrical nonsense. 12 years a slave is a prime example of that. No need for it.

157,redfearnb,Second best Civil War movie of all time.,8,31 March 2006,"I am a great fan of history and especially of the different war stories. However, my favorite movie about the Civil War is ""Gettysburg."" Now I can say that my second favorite movie about the Civil War is ""Glory.""There is a long tradition of every war-based movie being very lengthly and seeming to last forever, but Glory didn't pass the ""patience"" line to where I am looking at my watch all the time and wondering how much longer the movie will last. This is the first look at the contribution of black soldiers to the Civil War, that I know of, and is finely accomplished.Colonel Shaw (Mattew Broderick) is the only actor I didn't like. He doesn't seem to fit the role very well and his mustache and/or facial hair is often falling off of his face. Maybe Broderick should have grown out his hair a little longer. All of the other actors do a very fine job and are very impressive. No complaints other than that. Very good movie, it is edited down to PG, so there is hardly a scene one can complain about while watching. No gory battles where limbs go flying every direction, but there one hospital scene where the implied result of war wounds is VERY vivid.",Glory

This film features fine performances from Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Andre Braugher, along with fine combat footage that rivals the gritty realism of Saving Private Ryan. Although, as James McPherson notes in his book ""Drawn with the Sword,"" features some inaccuracies, (the 54th was mainly composed of Freedmen, not former slaves; Col. Shaw had to be bullied by his father, a prominent abolitionist, into accepting the commission as officer of the African-American unit) its flaws are far outweighed by its quality. It is one of the best Hollywood treatments of the war, surpassing Gone with the Wind and Birth of a Nation.",Glory
159,zwrite2,Great history lesson illustrated by fantastic storytelling,9,9 March 2008,"""Glory"" is a great movie with strong, multifaceted characters who have numerous intriguing conflicts. More importantly, ""Glory"" is a very important movie.I'm a History aficionado, but I knew nothing about the story of the first all-African American regiment of Civil War soldiers  a 600-person regiment led by a handful of white officers. More movies like this should be made because they can, frankly, help make the American people smarter about history and spur them to learn more.It's true that the individual African-American soldiers in ""Glory"" are fictional people in the middle of the portrayal of actual events, but the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment was real. If I find out that the writers had in-depth information on actual soldiers, I'll be disappointed. In the meantime, I'll praise the history lessons imparted by the movie.""Glory"" does an excellent job portraying the different kinds of whites and blacks who lived in the Civil War era  abolitionists, anti-black Union soldiers, corrupt Union officers, educated free blacks, uneducated blacks, and blacks who were understandably angry and rebellious after years of slavery and other moral outrages.Although the individuals portrayed are fictional, their character types can be used in a classroom to teach Civil War history. ""Glory"" is not exactly ""JFK""  an abomination that has dishonestly taught ignorant young Americans lies about history.""Glory,"" though, would be a great movie even if it wasn't a valuable history lesson. The movie is a storytelling masterpiece. It does a splendid job of introducing the main characters and focuses on just the right amount of people  four black soldiers and three white officers. All these characters are strongly developed, and the writing lures viewers into following their progress.The strong characters set up a long list of interesting character conflicts that dominate the movie and kept me riveted. My list includes the regiment's white abolitionist commander vs. his deputy/lifelong friend, the commander vs. a white officer who harshly disciplines blacks, the commander vs. an educated black man he knew in Boston, an angry black man vs. the educated black man, and the angry black vs. the leader of the blacks portrayed by Morgan Freeman.Each of these conflicts is bolstered by well-written dialogue that often includes dramatic and intriguing confrontations.There are also at least three supporting characters in the Union Army that the lead character, Col. Robert Gould Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick), has conflicts with as he fights for the rights of his African-American troops to have adequate equipment and fight the Confederates.In addition, there are group conflicts that fit seamlessly into the plot  white officers trying to train black soldiers, blacks fighting to be treated as equals, white bigots vs. white non-bigots, Union soldiers and officers persevering despite Confederate threats to execute them for race mixing, and the North vs. the South.Actual letters written by the real Shaw are used as voice-overs. They give an insight into a man who is empathetic to blacks, has hopes and fears about the Civil War and his regiment, and makes observations about his soldiers' off-the-field culture and camaraderie. His letters make his behavior even more interesting as he evolves into a commander who is often tough toward his trainees.Although Col. Shaw becomes strong and principled, the evolution of the educated (Thomas) and angry black (played by Denzel Washington) men are even more interesting. Thomas evolves from a privileged man who is a terrible soldier into a profile in courage who overcomes gun wounds to save the life of his personal enemy, Washington, and becomes an outstanding warrior.Washington is in one great scene after another as he evolves from a selfish, angry man who initiates fights into a war hero who learns how to channel his excessive energy. I generally don't comment on acting, but Washington is spectacular. He earned his Best Supporting Actor award!! I felt like I was watching his character, not him, particularly as he maintained his composure while staring at Col. Shaw as he gets whipped in one of the five best movie scenes I've ever seen.Washington's intensity in the whipping scene and others (fighting for equal pay, challenging racist white soldiers, lecturing Thomas) leaps off the screen. Sean Penn is a very good actor, but I'm consciously aware it's him when I watch him, and I get the impression he's calibrating how intense he can be without losing his credibility.""Glory"" was even better when I watched it for a second time. I was tempted to give it a 10, but there were a few inexplicable alterations to actual history (Shaw's death was more dramatic in real life), there were minor pacing problems, and I was disappointed that there is not a scene at the end that showed which of the main characters survived. Did they all die? I give ""Glory"" a 9.ZWrite",Glory

It's not a perfect war movie, the soldiers are too peaceful to a must-die mission, their bravery makes them seems a little unhuman to me. But the story, the mood and the music score are so great, there are several scenes that almost made me cry. Honestly, I don't feel Washington is so good, there is no bad boy look on his face, he talked like a big hero even if in the scene which he is blaming the poor black gentleman.But Mogan Freeman is really good, especially in the Pay Day scene.",Glory
161,wentos,well done historical epic with good actors and no cgi,8,9 November 2021,"Interesting movie. In many aspects. Well done acting.I watched it long time ago possibly not long after it was released (yes I am that young). I thought there was time to see it again possibly with kids so that they learn some if not about history than about humans and about good movies that hollywood once made. I have my reservations about showing this to my kids in 2021. For obvious reasons. We are all white and at least I am not ashamed of it as I do not see why I should. That is not as obvious in times when stating the obvious may land you prosecuted for hate speech. I am writing this because directly when I started to watch this I noticed that the main character used the n. Word not even 3 minutes into the film. A white boy saying n. Word. Is this at all possible today?Now you may wonder why that matters for a film review. I think it does. The movie is 30yo and it seems to me that current culture wars will not stop till side cuts throats of the other in sufficient numbers. In this respect this movie can be seen also as a more general depiction of human condition. The war seems to be inherent to our nature and it brings best and worst in it to the fore. Even if you try wholeheartedly to avoid bloodshed you may end up on a battlefield - as with other things, progress has been made so that battlefield may be far away in normal sense of it - so that marching towards guns firing at you (as seen directly in first minutes of the movie) may not be your experience but you will be marching and the other side will be shooting.As for the film itself it is one side of the very complex history. It cannot cover it all obviously. It did a good job showing the history of the US. I am just not sure if that is the US these fellows depicted in the movie were fighting for. But then we are again discussing the issues far beyond the scope of the movie but maybe that is why some movies are made? Not only to show senseless violence w/o real effect and superhumans never getting hurt but to show how it is and how it was. When I saw it decades ago I thought: well made historical epos. Now it provokes thought and consideration far beyond what the makers could envision. From this perspective the movie achieved its goal at least for me. Not sure however how many of us would still watch and consider the the pain, misery, heroism etc on all sides because as we know - only one side can be right and the world has to be seen in highest contrast settings possible.A good movie. I gave it 8 especially as it became current in ways that makers and actors etc could not see back then.",Glory

Also, Edward Zwick sure does know how to make some great and heart-wrenching battle scenes (The Last Samurai as well directed by Zwick has some of the most intense battle scenes I've ever seen). This movie makes you feel for each and every one of the people under Shaw's battalion.

166,joeydean61869,One of the greatest masterpieces ever committed to celluloid,10,11 November 2006,"**** out of **** starsRegrettably, I never saw Glory on the big screen when it was released in 1989. I consider this an enormous tragedy-being the movie enthusiast that I am-because Glory is one of the greatest war masterpieces ever committed to celluloid, and I wish I had had the harrowing and breath-taking cinematic experience that was intended.My first viewing of Glory was a mere flicker of its ending back in 1991 or '92. I was in the Navy stationed in Southern California and it was playing one afternoon in the barracks rec room. I looked up at the shabby 19-inch television and saw a regiment of black soldiers readying themselves for an attack on Fort Wagner. I knew not who these men were, or the hardships they had endured, or why they had arrived at this crossroad, but I still felt the hairs on my forearms and at the nape of my neck stand on end and the tears well up in my eyes. I cared for them instantly, and after finally watching Glory in its entirety, I cared for them even more.From the opening frames of the battle of Antietam to the ending cataclysm at Fort Wagner, I was continuously amazed, again, at how much I cared for characters who weren't even the main players: slave children on the side of the road, or women watching the 54th Massachussets infantry consummate their pass-and-review. The pride, hope and worry in their eyes is an important element in the film's emotional continuity. Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the proud and well educated son of Boston abolitionists. We know Shaw's advancement to Colonel is ""grandfathered"" by his family and their aristocratic inner-circle, but his magnanimous nature and proficiency as a leader more than makes up for it. We like Shaw so much that we forget we need to forgive him for his breeding.Denzel Washington plays Trip, a runaway slave who has no future outside the 54th regiment. Thomas Searles, Trip's polar opposite, is played by Andre Braugher. Searles worked for Col. Shaw's father, is well-educated, idealistic and lofty enough to impose his aptitude on the soldiers who are ""less learned"". Throughout the hardships of basic training, Searles realizes he has more learning to do than anyone, and his initial feeling of superiority changes into shame. The great Morgan Freeman is cast as Sgt.Maj. John Rawlins, the conscience of the film. An ex-grave digger turned father figure for the 54th, Rawlins is also an arbitrator between the ill-supplied black troops and Col. Shaw. Shaw is desperate to communicate through the intellectual and racial barriers that separate him and his men, and Rawlins assists, gaining great respect for his commanding officer and sometimes mixed respect from his subordinates.The choir-like arias and resonant cellos of James Horner's wonderful score is a staple of beauty throughout the film. I can think of no other piece of music that could be as grand, or as subtle. To this day, it remains my favorite composition in a motion picture...and I love many.Glory is not so much a history lesson as it is a submersion into the depths of honor, and yes...glory. It's a movie that tugs on your heart strings, even after the battle is over.",Glory

This unit was never activated, and, eventually was committed to the Union side after the fall of New Orleans.The second all black regiment formed to fight for the Union was the 72nd Negro Volunteer Infantry from South Carolina.As for Robert Gould Shaw, he was like many high ranking Federal officers, a political ""hack.""",Glory

169,Doctor_Mongoose,A repulsively condescending exploitation film,4,10 September 2009,"When I finished watching this film I honestly felt sick. It is one of the most patronising and formulaic films that I've seen in a long time that serves the viewer nothing but overblown sentimentality and self-righteousness.Race is an extremely important issue that deserves to be treated with respect. This film merely seeks to exploit the highly emotionally charged issues in a pathetic attempt to try and bring hollow tears to the faces of its viewers.Everything in this film is done by the book. All the stereotypical characters are there, lined up and ready to be used in the most cliché of fashion. The film doesn't even try and tell a story but instead stick a load of over the top scenes together, accompanied by an extremely annoying pretentious score, that try to create many climactic ""moments"" to try and move the viewer.Another thing that really annoyed me about this film is the title itself, ""Glory"". What is really glorious about a load of men getting killed, black or white? The film doesn't even try to portray the foolishness of war and instead resorts to partiotically flag-waving, proud that America was founded on such bloodshed. Mel Gibson in a kilt screaming ""FREEDOM"" at the top of his lungs would not seem out of place.However, when you spray as many emotional scenes about the place at least a couple are going to hit their targets. The scene where Matthew Broderick is shouting at the stuttering squirrel shooter and fireing his pistol did manage to get a response out of me. This is because it was one of the few scenes that decided to leave race alone and attempt to deal with the reality of war. Another couple of scenes were well done too, but these scenes' resonance was muted by the overall quality of the others.The battle scenes were well done, in a sense that they looked realistic. I thought that these might be able to help save the film but, to my dismay, as soon as I'm starting to believe in them another highly telegraphed clichéd plot point comes along that completely breaks up the intensity and disintegrates into farce.There isn't really a lot more than I can say about the film. I can't really comment on the quality of the acting because the actors were forced to play such one dimensional characters. I had been recommended this movie by a couple of people and had really high hopes for it, but instead of being a glorious experience it was condesending and repulsive.",Glory
170,Audie-T,The first black regiment in the American Civil War prepare to meet their destiny.,9,26 December 2003,"Great war-movie with a unique viewpoint, detailing the battles and setbacks suffered by the men of the 54th Mass. Regiment which lead to their ultimate test: a frontal assault over open terrain against a fortified enemy.Some people may say the movie's score is a bit too emotional and perhaps melodramatic. Frequently we hear the angelic voices of the (Harlem) boys' choir during the film. In my opinion however, Ennio Morricone did an excellent job. Remember this film must be seen with the attitudes of the people living in those days in mind. Fighting in battle, killing and dying, were seen as honorable and one of the highest things Man could achieve.SPOILERIn hindsight, after you have seen the film, everything falls into place perfectly. The attack on the Confederate fort is doomed from the start on. Colonel Shaw and his men know they have little chance of succeeding or even surviving. But when Shaw volunteers his men for this suicide charge, there is not one dissenting voice among the men of the 54th Mass. On the contrary, armed with their rifles and bibles, they know their sacrifice will prove their critics wrong: black men can fight like real men, they're not just a bunch of freed slaves. Denzel Washington's character's statement in boot camp sums it up perfectly: 'A black man can stop a bullet as well as a white man, and for less money!'The voices of angels accompany the men when they march to the beach to prepare for their charge. Director Zwick also says in the commentary that it's really the image of a glorious funeral march. On a technical note, the most impressive aspect about this film is the visual effects during the charge. 'Glory' was made before the digital revolution. Then again, computer effects could never match the intensity of realistically portrayed combat, as is evidenced by Spielberg's 'Band Of Brothers'. For realistic shell explosions and bullet wounds, nothing beats the trusted non-digital techniques when shooting close-combat scenes.As a European, I will say that eventhough I did know a bit about the American Civil War, this film was a big eye-opener to me because I had not known until then that black soldiers made up as much as 10 percent of the combat troops during the last years of the American Civil War.My real criticism is not against the movie, but against the (lack of) tactics during the American Civil War. If you have the sense to dig in and take cover, then why can't you provide decent suppression fire for your advancing troops? But the same can be said about the First World War, where millions of men marched to their deaths over open ground, exposed to enemy machine gun fire and artillery...

172,jameslipski,A history listen for all,10,25 August 2012,"Glory is a film showcasing the talents of Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. It is based upon a true story of the first black soldiers organized to fight for the Union during the American Civil War. Matthew Broderick portrays Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who has volunteered to lead the regiment. The movie shows the struggles he goes through to take raw recruits and train them to be a fighting unit prepared to kill and be killed. He hires a tough Sgt Major to do the training and he is unmerciful. No one who is white believes the black men can be anything more than parade soldiers. Morgan Freeman is the oldest recruit and his calm is the voice of reason for he has buried many white soldiers during the first 2 years of the war. Col Shaw sees him as the go between the officers and the enlisted and he is terrific as the father figure.Denzel Washington is the young former slave who has so much hatred inside him that he will fight anyone just for the sake of fighting. The unit faces many challenges during training, not the least of which is the Army supply unit not wanting to issue them new shoes and socks as they are reserved for ""fighting regiments"". Slowly we watch as a disorganized group of 600 men are turned into a real disciplined cohesive regiment. As the men are nearing the end of their training two things happen that could tear the group apart. First Congress has ordered the men not to be paid the regular army wage of $13 per month, but only $10 because they are black. Then a letter is read from the Confederate States that say any black man caught taking up arms against the South will be returned to slavery. Also any white officers leading blacks into battle captured will be immediately executed. After reading this letter Col Shaw expected mass requests to leave, but is shocked to find not one member wants to leave. After training and being issued their blues and weapons they go south to fight. But discover they are only to be used as laborers. But Col Shaw finally gets his wish for combat duty after blackmailing his commanding General. When they do go into battle for the first time they prove their worth. Then we see as an attack is planned on Fort Wagner near Charleston. The regiment commanders present are informed that due to the terrain only one regiment at a time can advance on the fort. Col Shaw volunteers his regiment to lead the attack despite knowing the losses in men will be horrific. The night before the attack we see how the soldiers prepare for death. They show no fear and know their duty. On the morning of the attack Col Shaw prepares for his own death in letter writing to his mother and asks a newspaper reporter to make sure his personal effects get to her. There is a scene where he is on his horse by the waters edge and the expression on his face brought me to tears. Bravely Col Shaw and his officers lead the attack and it is a brutal realistic scene of humans being wasted for a small plot of land. When the attack is over I know I was not the only one to cry. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn about our nation's history.",Glory

175,antoinedb2001,the greatest civil war movie ever made,10,7 June 2016,"""GLORY"" is a war film directed by Edward Zwick and stars Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Andre Braugher. it tells the story of the 54th soldier regiment consisting of only black men who sign up in an all white soldier regiment to fight for their freedom. this movie is not only a good war film, it is a great film, period. allow me to elaborate on that:the performances: Matthew Broderick as Robert Gould Shaw is one of his best performances in a feature film, where in most movies that I have seen him in, he was bland and uninteresting. Denzel Washington as private Trip was a great performance showing how tough he is to the whites but caring and passionate towards the freedom of blacks which gave him a well earned Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, Morgan Freeman was excellent in the movie, given that he can do no wrong, it clearly shows here. since this was his major film debut, Andre Braugher was great not only as a soldier fighting for freedom, but as a friend towards his companions and his general.the story: this is a moving piece of art that not only captures the spirit of freedom from segregation, but the hardships these men had to endure before they could gain the respect that they deserved. it is a tall tale about sacrifice and the goodwill towards men that not only gives this film an action edge, but an emotional one as well, making it a great historical story that remains accurate the source material that it took place in. The action: it is epic. it not only captures the brutality of war, but the coldness of it and how sad war can end up being. but when the action kicks in, it kicks into full gear giving us some spectacular moments that do kick plenty of butt. with the brilliant acting and the spectacular camera work and sound editing/mixing, it not only gives the film an epic edge but a highly accurate edge as well. final verdict: I was shown this in my history class and thought nothing of it at first. but as I watched it, I not only realized how engaging, epic, and moving that this film was, but how it also managed to sneak it's way onto my top 10 most favorite films ever.",Glory

177,eadaoin7,"More Than My Words Could Praise, The History Glorifies Itself",10,28 January 2006,"I find this one of my most difficult reviews to write. Even as I sit here for what must be the 206th viewing, I marvel, as acutely as I did in the very first viewing, that this tale has the compelling and overwhelming power to touch aesthetically, viscerally, profoundly and emotionally my sense of pride,injustice, soul. Even if this were not a true story, I would still recommend this movie to everyone with awe and reverence. And even as I watch, there is goose-flesh and damp eyes. As there always is...Based on the letters compiled and only two reference books (including ""One Gallant Rush"" by Peter Burchard, which I proudly own), this tells the tale of the heretofore largely unknown 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first Afro-American regimen in American history during the Civil War. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw was a 26-year old bright eyed Bostonian who was chosen by favor to lead the ""first colored regimen"" at the apex of the Civil War. Matthew Broderick portrays Col. Shaw as accurately as possible, bringing the youth and zeal of the real Shaw to grand light. He was truly overwhelmed by the thought of leading the troops, but idealistic and optimistic enough to give it everything he had and to make his family and title proud. Broderick never loses sight of the simple fact that Shaw was humble and grateful for every advancement he was given. Although in reality the 54th was compiled of mostly free black men from upper New England, Denzel Washington is cast as the runaway slave Trip who brings his grudges and injustices to the troop. He portrays a slave who is on a personal mission to hurt those who have hurt him (if you know about the history of slavery, one can hardly blame him), but in the process hurts himself all the more until by rote he learns to channel his hate into determination, and by his actions is humiliated and beaten down to the point that he can only rise up like a griffin and prove that he is as much a soldier as the rest of them. The 'whipping scene' in which you see him go through that exact process, every emotion known to a man culminating in a quiver of the cheek, a single tear escaping, and eyes that shred, plea, hate, mourn, haunt. That Denzel could convey that with a role that could have easily been a stereotype deserves more praise that I can type. Morgan Freeman is a man of quiet yet profound dignity that carries him in every role he plays, and this time as Rawlins is no exception. He is a victim of prejudice, but still carries his own as a man. He is there for his men as a leader even before being officially decorated, but he is not above reaching out to Shaw to help his men simply because Shaw is yet another white authority--he helps the cause, no matter the colors. And that cause is so much more than the War, which I will explain further below...The score by the wunderkind James Horner is Majesty in every literary definition of the word. I know that if I'm ever stressed and need a release, all I have to do is pop in a CD of this score, listen for only a few minutes, and I will be sobbing. In my humble opinion he has yet to top himself with his work in this picture. From the subtle ache of a single horn to the swelling of the Harlem Boys' Choir and their keening voices that beg us to remember forever.I won't break down the actors, directing or anything individually any more than I have because that's not the intention of this film. It's not a star vehicle, but rather hundreds of people coming together to tell a story they believe in. And as such, deserve to be praised as a whole, which only proves how well they've done their work. But some scenes cannot escape the psyche...The morning after they've been read a proclamation stating that they will be put to death, black and white, if caught bearing Union arms, and there they stand as a unit for roll call, not one man deserting, at attention for duty, prouder and taller than ever...The aforementioned Corporal Punishment scene (which, by the way, was the same punishment white officers would suffer if they deserted as well)...The charge on Fort Wagner--Shaw finally returning to the seashore he so loved all his life for what he knows in his heart is the last time, feeling home again and yet feeling already a walking spectre--Rawlins with a divine inner pride in his eyes marching toward the fort as Thomas looks to the others and Trip with no longer the mad lashing-out force to kill but the aggravated determination to win--the company as a whole marching into Fate with a gallant unified step...The true meaning of ""hero"" is in the heart of a man who faces even death if it will prove himself a man, not only to others but to himself. This lies true for every person in that brave pioneering regimen, black and white. They didn't just die for their country or their rights, but for their own personal honors and faiths as human beings who are deserved of dignity. The likes of which this country will never see again, but must not fall into obscurity. At the heart, and in my heart, this is not a story of men, but what it means to be a man. And the sacrifice it sometimes takes to become one and prove yourself one. We as a Nation, as Earth, should thank the 54th for that beautiful lesson. This pristine film will guarantee it so.",Glory

181,LJAllen,A Valiant/Flawed Effort,10,20 May 2001,"The film ""Glory"" was a tremendous effort depicting the valor and sacrifice of the Massachusetts 54th Colored Regiment's assault on Fort Wagner near Charleston, South Carolina. Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington deliver stand out performances that offer powerfully moving messages about the plight of Black Americans during this watershed in American history. Yet for all of this film's strong points, it offered viewers many inaccuracies that Hollywood seems incapable of avoiding when rendering accounts of Black American history. The 54th Regiment was made up of 1,000 men that were primarily well-educated, professional northerners from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, the Midwest, Canada, and in one instance a Black émigré from Bermuda that then lived in New York City. His name was Robert J. Simmons. He became a Sergeant in the 54th. The film unfortunately left viewers with the impression that the regiment was primarily composed of illiterate, recently escaped or freed slaves. Nothing could have been further from the truth about the 54th and indeed the majority of Black soldiers who served in the Union Army! Many were doctors, lawyers, educators, and other professionals. (I challenge viewers to read Edwin S. Redkey's compilation of Black Union soldiers' letters entitled ""A Grand Army of Black Men"". You will discover that letter-writing is a lost art as most of these letters are eloquent and highly descriptive. You will be immediately struck by the grammatical accuracy and various details about their personal and professional lives that underscores these men's obvious exposure to first-rate educations and a variety of professional and business pursuits.) While ""Glory"" was moving and relatively historically accurate, it failed to acknowledge Black Abolitionist Frederick Douglass' two sons who served in the 54th, one of whom became a Sergeant Major. The character of Thomas Searles, portrayed by the phenomenal Andre Braugher, was the only educated free Black northerner depicted in this film. Unfortunately, his character was depicted as too intellectual to be psychologically and physically fit for the rigors of military life; there was no innuendo that his allegedly privileged, ""free"" life in Massachusetts had rendered him less capable of adjusting to the rough life of a soldier. The brave men who actually served in the 54th were as articulate and intellectual as Searles, but viewers would never have known it by viewing this film. While we can be certain that there were Black Union soldiers more adaptable to combat than others, viewers should have at least been allowed to learn that Black male intellectualism, physical prowess, and military capability were, more often than not, compatible components found in many of these individuals. ""Glory"" represented a good first effort at describing what happened at Fort Wagner that fateful day of 18 July 1863, but it managed to offer viewers a rather flawed depiction of the personalities, backgrounds, and motives of the Black men who made up this regiment. Viewers would have been better served if the narrative had drawn on much more than Colonel Robert Gould Shaw's letters. Viewers might have learned that lettered Black men from the north were bright individuals who could and did fight heroically. This film gets an ""A+"" for performances, but a ""C-/B+"" due to its historical inaccuracies.",Glory

187,MrJukka,"Frankly, I expected more",6,10 October 2005,"Since the movie came out, I haven't heard much anything but good things about it. Therefore, I was surprised by how mediocre a movie it really is.It is understandable that Holleywood could not present the historical events without serious simplifications. How else could the American public understand it. Blacks are fighting for their freedom with pure hearts. The only trouble maker is just angry at the world and settles down before the end. The whites are either assholes or enlightened moral men with iron back bone. This is so far from real life it makes me puke.Let me first tell you what annoyed me about the movie: at the time when American government is more than ever using blatant violence to secure their own interests around the world, this kind of glorification of war and killing sickened me. If the American civil war really had been about values I might excuse it, but it was not. It was about cotton, molasses and grain. Southern states had it, northerners didn't. That's what the blacks were fighting for, not their freedom.The men they were killing weren't their true enemies, for the most part. Just a bunch of other poor folks. There is no Glory in war. Just killing and dying with more or less bravery, but glory, no.As normally in war movies, dieing was too clean. War is not clean. The bullet rarely seeks the heart. Slaying someone with a bayonet certainly is not clean and bloodless.I am not squeamish. I like a good action movie, even a splatter once in a while, but they are not serious. Glory took itself much too seriously to be a mindless action movie.The movie could have been so much more. There were elements for great drama in there, but the writing took all the short cuts available to it. Such pity.Why did I then give it as much as 7/10?

191,psmcdoug,A True Classic,10,9 February 2004,"When I filled out my personal profile after registering for IMDb, there was a question that asked me for my favorite movie.  I thought for a minute or two, and decided that it was indeed Glory.  As I sit and wonder why I consider it my favorite, I realize a number of things that draws me to the movie.  There's the actors-- Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, Morgan Freeman, and Andre Braugher.  All of their characters begin the movie with serious flaws, then evolve into admirable, if not exceptional human beings.  Then there's the action, which is delicately balanced so that it neither inundates and desensitizes, nor comes across too weakly or diluted.  In my opinion, few scenes in the myriad of war movies throughout time capture the power, brutality, and yes, the true glory of the assault on Fort Wagner.  The closest comparison I can think of is the Normandy landing in Saving Private Ryan.  Finally, there's an awful lot in the movie about tolerance, respect, and love for your fellow man, that should serve to show us Americans the way life is supposed to be.  If certain movies, like classic books, were to be mandatory to the curriculum of high school students in the United States, this would certainly be one that I'd require.",Glory

However, not even the fantastic performances from Denzel Washington and Andre Braugher can distract from the pacing issues, the inconsistent quality of dialogue and the weak execution at times. Matthew Broderick was a questionable casting choice as he definitely holds this film back with his comically amateurish performance. Glory is not a triumph, but it has its moments.",Glory

194,dekk,Very touching true story of the most famous black regiment of the Civil War.,10,5 July 2001,"This is by far the best movie of all time.  It is historically accurate as well as touching and dramatic.  Matthew Broderick gave an outstanding performance as Robert Gould Shaw, The colonel of the 54th  negro regiment of Massachusetts.  Although hardly known, Jihmi Kennedy gave a great performance as a stuttering black soldier.  Cary Elwes also did a good job as Major Cabot Forbes, second in command.  Morgan Freeman gave the best performance of the soldiers in the 54th, (Matthew Broderick was the best overall) and so was Denzel Washington, who won an academy award for his portrayal of the runaway slave soldier, Trip. Another plus in this motion picture is the music, which was incredibly fit for the movie, and really brought emotions alive. Okay, that's enough.

He was the first person of color to receive the highest award a soldier can earn. BIG OVERSIGHT. Other than that, it's an excellent film. It should be adopted by High Schools everywhere to tell the sad but true truth of the Civil War, why it was fought, the personal sacrifices these men endured, and the difficulty and prejudices that Major Shaw faced and handily dealt with leading these brave men not only into battle, but into the first real fight for racial equality.",Glory
196,WindWoman3,A Classic,10,5 June 2004,"""Glory"" is a modern film classic that highlights a little-known chapter of the Civil War.I recently purchased the DVD, and was just as moved (if not more so) as the first time I saw it.Broderick, Freeman, and Washington, along with a stellar cast play it faultlessly. I still remember the brouhaha over the casting of Matthew Broderick as Shaw, and I see that even now some IMDb posters single him out for fault in ""Glory."" Sorry, but I disagree. One should remember that the real Col. Shaw was a young man in his mid-20s - hardly a grizzled old veteran - despite his high rank. Broderick actually does bear a resemblance to Shaw, and shouldn't be criticized for his boyish looks. I felt every nuance of the burden he carried, and thought Broderick did a wonderful job.Denzel Washington's powerful acting may never again have a showcase like it did in ""Glory."" His beauty, rage, and pride scream in every frame. His Oscar for this break-out role was highly deserved. Trip's character is really the distillation of what this film is all about: the black man's heart-rending battle for worth, recognition, and dignity. As far as I'm concerned no one BUT Washington could have played Trip. Thank God for Denzel!Morgan Freeman is the film's human core. His quiet compassion and leadership keeps the soldiers focused. His one angry confrontation with Trip proves he has the goods to back up a field promotion to Sergeant Major.Freeman (an appropriate reminder of where surnames come from) is the father figure the regiment desperately needs in a time of death and crisis. The men look to him for his calming wisdom and reasonable, fair demeanor.Films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" raised the technical bar for battle scenes.The fighting scenes in ""Glory"" are, unfortunately, it's weakest element. The staging and choreography are mediocre at best. And other than a scene where the 54th Massachusetts is given a hero's flanking onto the battlefield beaches of South Carolina, these shots don't emotionally engage the viewer. Still, in the end, ""Glory"" isn't about big, noisy battles. It's about the transcendence of the human spirit in the face of bigotry, bad treatment, and almost certain death. It's about a watershed moment in our bloody history that elevated us all and must never be forgotten.""Glory"" is, indeed, glorious.",Glory

The only performance I'd say he did better in was Malcolm X. Matthew Broderick's greatest performance came from this film. Morgan Freeman was even better than his usual magnificent self.

198,enjoiskaterguy,Incredible none the less,10,23 September 2005,"This movie is a brilliant piece of filmography and I might even stretch to say its one of the greatest ever made. This movie has it all. It has this amazing story which depicts the lives and hardships the African American Soilders go through in the War of the states, or more commonly known as the Civil War. The story goes even further though, and breaks down the racial and class structures of that time and how each of every color and stature co-exist together within the same regiment.The acting i superb. Mathew Brodrick does a great job at this role as Col. Robert Gould Shaw, considering the fact that he is still pretty young at this stage of his career and hasn't had the experience like other actors that could of had that role. Denzel Wahington's performance was great as well...and IO believe he even won an academy award for his role as Pvt.Trip in Glory. He always does a wonderful job and I wouldn't of picked another actor to do it. My favorite acting in that movie was Matthew Brodrick, but I think Morgan Freeman did an incredible job as well. As Morgan Freeman as my favorite actor, I might be going over my head and crediting him to much in this role, but I just think he was great. Although his lines in the movie are short of length compared to the other roles, he does a great job at what he was given to do. His presence and feelings you get when you watch him speak really makes you think he is part of that time period and he isn't Morgan Freeman the actor, but rather Sgt. Maj. John Rawlins. Cary Ewles (also in Robinhood and men and tights and The Princess Bride) also was not disappointing. His loyal feelings towards the Union and to Col. Robert Shaw are really brought to life with his acting. He is a very solid actor in my opinion.The Directing of Edward Zwick is genius. Every time I watch this movie I always get the feeling like I'm actually watching a live recording of the Civil War. His angles, sets, and location decisions were outstanding I must say. The way he portrayed the life of African Americans and their struggle for freedom and equality is life like and thought provoking to the last. The fact that this movie is based on a true story makes me appreciate this movie even more and I never get tired of watching it.the writing and screen play was wonderful as well. The main story, the true historical background, and the addition of some individual outside problems are what makes this story connect and make it a solid story. The screenplay and dialogue are both well put together. The slang, dialogue, and presence people used back then are used affective and used to a great advantage to help this movie become a classic. There seems to be not one cheesy or unnecessary piece of dialogue through out the whole movie and that said the dialogue is smooth throughout the entire film. The characters emotions, and actions are predictable enough to say that they are life like, but unpredictable the same, which helps the film not become too dull or too predicable.James Horner's Original score for the movie was wonderful. The choice to have a classical score for this movie was the right way to go. It brought the mood and tone together in this movie and it also helped us, well me at least, appreciate war a little more with its sad tone and gave the movie a more of a professionally made edge to it as well. I think without that element in the mix, the movie wouldn't be what it is today. The music is key to a lot of movies and this movie is one that would benefit from its own music....and last, but not least I just would like to close by saying this movie's elements and messages of horror of war, connecting with the ones you have around you, diversity acceptance, freedom for all, and compassion and care for all people no matter what color you are, are the things that make this movie to be set aside from other war films. Its pure brilliance is showed all throughout the movie and never wavers from being interesting. If you haven't seen this movie, Every inch of my recommends it.

If you feel that the title ""Glory"" implies that the filmmakers feel that you should be standing up and cheering as you see people get shot, then you need to grow up. This is an excellent interpretation of the story of the 54th Massachusetts. There are technical mistakes that the anal-retentive could point out to you regarding certain dates and other silly details (when Shaw was killed he fell into Fort Wagner, not outside of it), but all of these things are acceptable given creative license. The acting is superb, let none of the other posters here tell you differently. The common knock you may read is regarding Matthew Broderick in the role of Robert Gould Shaw. This film came out 3 years after ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and people seem to feel that Broderick should have stayed in the role of a high-school senior forever, despite the fact that he was 24 when he played Ferris. Shaw was only 25 years old when he was killed. Broderick was 26-27 during filming.

Much like the films Saving Private Ryan and Last of the Mohicans, Glory stands as the war film to beat for its time period.Glory arguably contains the most technically realistic and memorable Civil War reenactment scenes ever shot.  Who didn't wince and watch in horror when Shaw and his regiment were blown to bits during the Antietam scene (which I would guess it was the West Woods portion of the Antietam battle??)?  Who didn't feel uplifted when the 54th cuts down the Confederate cavalry charge which foolishly thought it would be no problem to break the lines of an inexperienced -and black- regiment?  And finally, who didn't watch with solemn pride the dramatic climax of the Fort Wagner assault.This movie shows that even though the men were treated as (even below) second class citizens by their own country and army, they still had the integrity and honor to fight the best they could for the Union - and eachother.  That's why those men in the 54th and every other black regiment stood out from the rest.  They must have known of America's potential even before America did and fought to develop that and win black people the dignity and respect they always deserved but never got.  Glory puts that struggle on film for us to experience - and doesn't disappoint.",Glory

Hats off to Broderick as Shaw, Washington as Trip, Morgan as Rawlins for their memorable acting. The pick of the act was the whipping scene of Trip, his stare towards time, and humanity. The take was the drop of salty water from Trip's eyes that said a lot that we failed to understand and follow even after 150 years and perhaps will not in time to come. Great work by Edward Zwick, have seen defiance, siege, blood diamond, and earlier legends of the fall like directions, but need more close to Glory. He i suppose is a better director than producer. The movie touched my heart, its one of the should watch movies. Salute to 22 years back done hard work and salute to 150 years back display of courage, unity, and change.",Glory

208,acj-672-708924,Overall impressive,9,6 September 2014,"One of the other reviews I read about this title stated that the movie would have been better off with another actor playing the main character Col. Shaw. I humbly disagree. Matthew Broderick is an understated actor and he plays a young - and probably too young - commanding officer excellently.The movie shows very well what discipline and motivation and not least training can do to people, and it also shows what lack of purpose, lack of training and lack of discipline can do to otherwise normal, but uneducated, people. The lack takes away principles and higher standards.You can make animals - or as Col. Montgomery says it: ""They are just like monkeys."" Indeed, they were like monkeys, but that just shows that you can make any human behave like a monkey, not that they are born like them.",Glory

It is sincerely made and acting is top-notch as one would expect from a cast including names like Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. Jihmi Kennedy with his innocent smile is a surprise. Matthew Broderick plays the role of a diffident colonel who is son of wealthy Boston abolitionist and given command of the 54th Massachusetts regiment: the first colored regiment. The movie primarily focuses on the development of Broderick and Freeman.Overall a very sincerely made movie, not an over the top war movie with unrealistic heroic speeches or actions, that at times can make you cry.",Glory

Being a veteran, being a history teacher, and having an interest in gender performance, I watch this film from several perspectives. The creation of masculinity in the film is a safe window, distant from our modern wars and lives, but the similarities are striking. The racism amongst the black soldiers, between Union soldiers, and the layers: A great conversation starter and ender. What a wonderful piece of work. This movie is wasted on those that don't have the background knowledge to properly dissect it. The scene about getting off his high horse. . . Awesomely powerful.

212,4ize,Memorable and moving - truly glorious,10,22 April 1999,"Easily the best Civil War movie ever produced, and among the front rank of all war movies. Filled with memorable and moving scenes - the look of sheer defiance on Trip's (Denzel Washington) face as his already scarred back is whipped, the men of the 54th telling their stories around the campfire on the eve of battle, Shaw (Matthew Broderick) turning loose his horse on the beach before Ft. Wagner. History is brought to life more vividly in this film than in any big-budget all-star cast epic I can recall. Most often , those films only succeed in collapsing under their own weight and leaving audiences more turned off about history. Glory brings the issues of the time - slavery, freedom and sacrifice - down to human scale. We can understand why the men of the 54th were willing to take up arms, and how tragic it was that they had to sacrifice their lives in order to be considered men.",Glory

The soundtrack to the movie (written by James Horner) is one of the most incredible soundtracks available on CD. I would highly recommend it.The story is of an all black brigade in the civil war. Mathew Broderick is the son of an affluent family that is given the command of the brigade. The story depicts how the soldiers were treated by the Union and how they went to battle with the Confederacy. Ironically, there didn't seen to be much difference in the two. The story also illustrates how white soldiers, out of compassion or strictly out of sense of duty gave everything for the same noble cause that the black brigade was fighting for.

215,Muhls,The best civil war movie to date,7,14 October 2008,"Glory is a fantastic and well put together movie. It shows the hardships of Africa Americans during the civil war and how patriotic every single one of them were. It had a very well round plot with the beginning middle and end entertaining and easy to follow. I really love how Edward Zwick depicts the scenery of 1862- it was incredibly realistic. Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Mathew Brodrick made the film a remarkable work of art. Glory was a strong film and i think it is arguably the best civil war movie yet to be made. The ending was excellent and original. The movie was seen through the eyes of Mathew Brodrick otherwise know as the white commander of the 54th regiment Robert Shaw and how he feels for his black soldiers, it was truly moving. Most Civil War Movies are long and drag some extent but Glory got to the point quickly. The action in the film was limited to three war scenes but that is not a bad thing. I was hoping for a little more action but i guess i was satisfied with what little war violence was in it. In conclusion Glory was a magnificent movie and i would recommend it to anyone wanting to have an educational experience or just wanting to see a good movie",Glory

Although the special effects were nothing spectacular, it was at least believable. The only bad thing I could say about this movie was that at times it was a little drawn out (for example, the gospel singing near the end of the movie).

219,lordsangone,Glorious indeed. One of My Favorites of All-Time!,10,5 May 2018,"Movies should be cinematic, dynamic and most of all, entertaining. Films, shows and series are projects that fall short of what we expect from an experience we call a movie. Glory was able to encompass all these aspects into almost a whole different experience itself. The history, informative documentary, genres, hollywood factor, the politics, the productions and actors, the story, etc. were well thought out and beautifully executed.The story is a journey through the experiences of military men back in the civil war days. Two basic groups of men, the privileged and the rest. It starts off with the horrifying realities of war, death. But as we journey through the story we realize that death is not the worst part. The movie tries to show the conflicts between men of power, race, and loyalty while fighting a war. The fighting of arms is the backstory, but the real fighting is amongst themselves.We see two different cultures working in different ways to ultimately unite as one. Some of the most incredible scenes were not really the battles but by the interactions of the men. The camp fire scene was denzels highlight. He even managed to shed some tears, impressive. It was spiritual, memorable and entertaining. His role and performance symbolized the moral of the story.One other powerful scene was when the sarge slapped trip for using the n word against his own. One of many powerful and memorable scenes.Ive worked in West Baltimore for 35yrs. Im korean and own a corner grocery store. I still cringe when i hear youngens still using that word as a term of endearment. They would never dare say it in front of the older generation regardless of what it means or spelled. Watching a movie like Glory reminds us of all the horrors of bigotry and racism has caused in our country. Thats right, my country is America and I am proud to have moved on from those dark times.I go out of my way to thank Glory and all those who fought for our very freedoms we enjoy today. We can not forget our history and we must learn from our mistakes as a nation of diversity. We have diversity only because we were able to unite first. These types of truths is what created real freedom in America. Glory is a great example of how struggles and suffering can bless a whole nation and they do it in such a powerful way. It wasnt just a great movie, it was a powerful message of unity vs. diversity and truth vs. freedom. Its a movie that educates not just of history but human nature. Racism can never be understood fully if you havent been a victim of racism first. A black man can never be understood fully by a white man or a korean man such as myself. And vice-versa. Fortunately we have a movie like Glory to give us the next best thing. Glory is a movie told through the eyes of several types of men. Several stories wrapped in one. Although they were different, they were still able to triumph fighting as one, even if not victorious in the final battle, they were able to claim victory in more important ways.",Glory

This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it.

222,mjs3p,absolutely spectacular,10,12 July 2000,"GLORY is one of the most inspiring and moving films about war I have ever seen.  The characters of Freeman, Washington, and Broderick were so vividly created and full of spirit, that the viewer can really experience the passion and intensity they have in their fight for freedom.  The scene before the final battle (the assault on Ft. Wagner), where the regiment is singing `Oh, my lord  ` is one of the most moving scenes ever filmed. Although the battle scenes may not have the technical precision of the first 30 minutes of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, or Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY, they were still masterful.  Specifically, the Ft. Wagner assault was downright beautiful, with the spectacular, colorful lighting from the flashing of artillery and a beautiful score.  It was as if the beauty of the scene reinforced the `glory' that the 54th was fighting for. 
To top it all off, GLORY was also very historically accurate (from the decrease in pay to the holding out of shoes by the quartermaster), unlike recent Mel Gibson works: THE PATRIOT & BRAVEHEART).  The fact that it was all true only added to the emotional intensity.  I consider GLORY to be the greatest Civil War movie ever, and maybe the greatest war movie, period.  It also contends with RAGING BULL, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, THE SHINING, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK/LAST CRUSADE, & FIELD OF DREAMS as the best movie of the 80s.",Glory

I was surprised at how much i liked it because normally i only watch fantasy stuff. But after we saw it i was mesmerized it was awesome and sad and it even made some of us cry. I gotta say if your looking for movie based on the civil war it doesn't get much better than, it's even based on real life which makes it even better.

It is moving, historically accurate and a tribute to the men who fought in the civil war. The depictions of the African Americans who served the union cause are wonderful. Action is minimal, as the focus is on the men and what they went through. What battle scenes do exit are presented well. The climax of the assault on the Confederate fort is breathtaking.

Instead, it turned out to be a schlockfest with no charm or worth whatsoever! While it does have some good actors in it, like Morgan Freeman and Matt Broderick, it doesn't do any of the characters any favors and they do such a bland job portraying historical figures. There's a random scene where a guy gets violently circumnavigated, and it just left me completely appalled. And another thing; there's no actual plot. I had that exact same thought while watching Newsies, (which was actually decent) but here, it's actually true! Most of the scenes just happen for no reason. There is no substance as we go from one place to another. Then, there's a random goat which could've been a redeeming quality if it was in more scenes! Next, there's that mustached meathead who swears half the time he's onscreen and beats African Americans to a pulp the other half of the time! He's easily one of the Top 10 worst characters of ALL TIME! (on the same level as claude frollo from the Hunchback!) There's NOTHING here! I wish I never even HEARD of this movie!

No surprise then that he had the VHS the moment it was available.Seeing it for the first time on his small 12 inch TV, sat crooked necked on his bed, I enjoyed every minute of it.Today, the music fills me with emotions as I listen to its superb soundtrack. By far the best moment is after Shaw is killed and 54 charge up the embankment fuelled by rage.

Upon seeing a documentary on the real 54th, I was astounded at the historical accuracy of the film, right down to Shaw's charge during the attack on Fort Wagner (""Come on 54th!"").

232,ssoracoe,No Guts No Glory,9,21 February 2001,"Glory directed by Edward Zwick is the true story of the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts, the first black fighting unit recruited by the North during the Civil War.  Matthew Broderick plays Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle.  Shaw is the son of well to do abolitionists hailed from Boston high society.  Glory is the story not only Colonel Shaw, but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery.  Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Lihmi Kennedy, and Andre Braughter lead the cast of black volunteers portrayed in the movie based on Shaw's letters to home and two books.  The movie introduces us to a handful of recruits and follows them from their enlistment to their climatic assault on Fort Wagner.Overall, this production is historically accurate.  In the film, all of the dates are correct in the scenes they are depicting.  In real life, Shaw did fight at Antietam where he suffered a small wound to the neck and was asked by Governor Andrew to lead the 54th Massachusetts, which was to be the Union's first all black enlisted regiment.  In the movie when he was asked this, he quickly decides that he does want to lead this group while in reality it took him some time to come to this conclusion.  In general, some slaves and many free blacks were enlisted in the 54th.  The training at Readville's Camp was fairly accurate in its portayal of the hard conditions the soldiers were put through except for the portrayal of an Irish drill sergeant which there is no record of anywhere.  The Confederacy did issue the proclamation stating that any blacks fighting and white commanding officers of blacks would be killed if captured, but all the men were aware of this when they enlisted in the army as it occurred a month earlier than portrayed in the movie.  The 54th Massachusetts was short of supplies but not especially shoes as depicted and they did leave to a parade in Boston. Furthermore, all of the movements of the 54th throughout the South were accurate.  Shaw's men did in fact quarrel with Colonel Montgomery's troops as shown, but Shaw and Montgomery actually got along fine unlike in the film.  The 54th Massachusetts saw action in the Battle of James Island as shown in defending the Confederates attacks.  Fort Wagner was portrayed well however, the attack occurred on wrong side, as the actual attack came from the south not the north as depicted in the movie.  The charge itself was well portayed except for that the flagbearer survived yet 281 of the 600 men in the 54th Massachusetts did wind up being killed, injured, or wounded in battle.  Going against the military etiguitte of the time, Shaw being an officer was buried in a mass grave with his black soldiers.  Dealing with the characterizations in the film, most of the black regiment members were composite characters who were not actual people but did repesent the thoughts and actions of the men in the 54th Massachusetts.  Frederick Douglas' sons served as the basis for the character of Thomas or the educated free black in the regiment.  The portrayal of Shaw was accurate and Shaw's assistant did exist but there is no record that he was a previous friend of Shaw's.  Throughout the Civil War, the hospital were overwhelmed and in horrible conditions as was the hospital scene in the movie at Anteitam.  Most of the nurses were untrained and did not use aniseptics causing many wounds to become infected nor were there blood transfussions. There were not many anesthesias available and whisky was often used as a substitute in the event of an amputation.  As it turns out you were far more likely to die from disease during the Civil War than from a bullet. Throughout the film, the American thirty-five star flag is accurate.  Yet the Confederate flag flown over Fort Wagner at the end of the film did not exist in addition to many of the confederate flags shown that were rectangular in shape when they actually were square.  The uniforms of both sides were well done in the film as were the boys marching in front of the units.  The guns in the film were historically accurate except for the portrayal of serial numbers on rifles, which at the time only existed on pistols.  The material culture overall was very well done though. Shoulder to shoulder fighting still was used at the time as shown but the weapons over time had become far more accurate causing many to perish during the Civil War.  The idea of having an all black regiment was largely unpopular with whites of the time.  Most thought that blacks would make bad soldiers, but the black men of the 54th proved themselves worthy in battle leading to the creation of many more all black units.  The etiquitte between enlisted men and officers was depicted with Shaw and Thomas during basic training when Shaw broke off a casual conversation that his friend Thomas was trying to hold with him because it was not proper to do so.  There is no evidence of any gospel session with the men the night before a battle but sessions like the one shown in the movie did occur on slave plantations from time to time.  Finally, as depicted blacks undoubtedly faced racial slurs in their efforts to participate in the Civil War.This film is a reflection of the values of the late 1980's and into the early 1990's when it was produced in the simple fact that there was a movie about black soldiers in the Civil War.  Blacks until recently were thought to have no part in the battles of the Civil War.  Glory opened people's eyes to broader horizons or views.  It showed that America and the study of history is now inclusive to all.  Where as once blacks were thought to have had no part in the Civil War a movie now depicts one of their shining triumphs in battle. Yet a recognizable message can still be seen when the director, Edward Zwick, chose to show a story about black soldiers through the perspective of a white man.  In this, it can be seen that however far Hollywood and America as a society have come in racial equality there are still many strides yet to be made before everyone in this nation is truly equal.Technically the film is very well done.  It includes graphic and stunningly choreographed scenes first at the Battle of Antietam and then in the stunning climactic scene at Fort Wagner.  It has been described as the most accurate re-creation of a Civil War battle ever throught its extensive attention to every painstaking detail.  The strong visuals in the film greatly add to the plot and help to set the emotion of the time period in helping to make the film more realistic to the viewer.Like any war film, Glory, has its share of violence and despair, but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson.  It is a valuable viewing experinece that I would strongly recommend to mature teenagers and adults.  Glory serves as a valuable reminder that despite what history book say or rather what they don't say, blacks played a critically important role in the North's victory over the South in the Civil War, forever changing the evolution of America.",Glory

Glory was the first ever Civil War film I had watched and I have to say I was apprehensive of Broderick playing the lead, having seen his mediocre performance in Ferris Buellers Day Off. Fortunatley, my apprehensions were wrong and Broderick delivers an Oscar winning performance. And you just can't beat that death scene; it's just so heroic. Morgan Freeman is characteristically good in the role of the charismatic sergeant who inspires the men and Denzel Washington performs well as Pvt. Trip. I defy anyone not to feel exilerated by that fight in the forest, the way the rebels just appear out of the mist is just superb. THe musket fire is well done and I only wish that directors would make more films of this genre instead of focusing on some daft Americans in WW2. Glory is without a doubt the best film I have ever seen and if you have not seen this, GET IT!!! It is and will always be a classic.",Glory
237,pskoen,Wrecked by Matthew Broderick,6,8 July 2012,"Apologies to Matthew Broderick, but he simply did not have the gravitas necessary to carry the lead role in this movie. Yes, the rest of the cast is amazing. Yes, Zwick is a fine director of sprawling epics. But Broderick's performance is so un-epic and his accent is so atrocious, that the entire film is diminished. It always kills me when star-power casting choices outweigh common sense. Did he use the accent in the screen test? Or did he get the role without a test at all? It reminds me of the way that Dracula was destroyed by the monstrously bad (pun) accents of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder. Anyway, the rest of Glory is very good.

Colonel Shaw played by Matthew Broderick was one of the most perfect acts to see Broderick play. also along with the cast of Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, and Morgan Freeman, this film was the greatest war film to date. Denzel Washington played Private Trip, and i have to take my hat off to him. He played him so well. And the same compliments to Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. Even though I couldn't really see Freeman in a film of this caliber, He did fantastic just like every other movie he has been in. With its amazing accuracy of the Civil War and the strange outcome in the end, most people would see it as the actual greatest film to symbolize and give a real life-like feeling about being in the war in the 1800's.

This film shows how much the blacks were hated in the North also. The Union soldiers did not want to see the blacks taking their position or doing a better job of fighting. That is why they encountered so much hostility from their own side. It also showed the hatred for the Confederates by the North, mainly some of the higher ranking officers. (They called them Secessionists because it made them sound so much less patriotic. They did not want the Southerners seen as their own country, but as uncivilized rebels.) Many people from the North saw the creation of the 54th as a political manuver, not as a way to help the blacks be a part of the government system. There were also many people who wanted to help the blacks get ahead, and saw this as an opportunity to get them on equal ground with the whites. I was concerned when I first saw this film that it would be overly P.C. and try to show all Northerners as loving of all mankind and the Southerners as a group of brain dead hicks bent on killing and enslaving all blacks. This was a wonderful departure from that and was well acted, filmed, directed, and written. A good movie for anyone who is interested in the Civil War as it happened, not as many historians like to say it happened. Wonderful performances by all, especially Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes, and Andre Braugher. 8/10.",Glory
242,sburnell,"Robert Gould Shaw, a quiet hero",10,7 April 2006,"What makes this Civil War film work so well is that it is a superb ensemble piece. No one actor hogs the limelight and we get to know, if only briefly, a little of what makes each character in this film tick to where they will come together at the end and fight a doomed battle that will cost so many of them their lives. Each of them has an obstacle to overcome in order to make it to the final scenes. For Trip (Denzel Washington, who won an Academy Award for this role), it is an overriding rebelliousness born of the stain of slavery. For Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), it is the life of comfort, ease and education that makes the hard life of a soldier painful and difficult. For Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy), it is literacy and self confidence. John Rawlins, the character portrayed so superbly by Morgan Freeman, brings a forceful dignity that helps meld these men together into real soldiers.We also watch as their white commanding officer, Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played with idealism, shyness, tenacity and quiet pathos by Matthew Broderick in what is sure to be remembered as his finest screen work, struggles to overcome his own fears, doubts and mistakes to become the brave young commanding officer who struggles to prove to higher ups in the chain of command that blacks are as worthy to be soldiers as anyone else. There was some controversy over the casting of Mr. Broderick for this role by some critics who complained about his boyish looks and reputation for rebellious teen roles but he more than overcame any doubts about his ability to play such a mature role as this one in this fine historical film. Surely one of the finest movies ever made and one that has already become a classic of the genre, having been nominated for one of the top 100 best films list of the American Film Institute. A highly recommended film to watch that rescues an important historical incident from certain obscurity.",Glory

244,steve russell,The Matthew Broderick Problem,10,1 December 2001,"Many people have pointed to Matthew Broderick as a problem in the entire film, but have the following points been considered ?1) The whole idea was to show that young men did achieve officer status during the war, and was more related to their social background then their actual experiance under fire.2) That Broderick's entire role is underplayed to allow the intelligence of the men serving under him to become the real point of the movie.3) That in the last third of the movie, Broderick starts to act as an emotional soundboard for the fears and emotions of his unit, resulting in some of the finest acting I have ever seen. Remember the shore scene, where all Broderick has is a sea and sky backdrop to register all the fear and lost hope for himself and his men as they march towards an encounter that they will not return from. If you don't remember it it, set the video to rewind, and go look again, this was a great actor at work !Steve",Glory

Whether it was the characters or the musical score, Glory proved to be a film that ranks as one of the all-time greats. Many war movies depict events that occurred during the Vietnam or World Wars so it was fascinating to see a movie based on the events of the Civil War. Characters such as Matthew Broderick delivered such a magnificent performance as the leader of the first ever all black regiment for the Union. His character really showed what leadership and determination is all about despite the ridicule you might get for doing something no one else would do. Denzel Washington also came through with a breakout performance as Private Trip, a slave who grows from a rebellious slave to a persevering hero. The rest of the cast, including Morgan Freeman and Carl Elwes, helped add memorable roles during the film as well. Besides the suspense and action, I found the music incredibly moving which helped add emphasis especially to the battle scenes. If you have not seen this film, I strongly urge you to see it. It is a must see.",Glory

Denzel Washington was brilliant as Trip, and deservedly won an Academy Award for it.  Matthew Broderick's performance as Shaw was perfect, ""right on the money,"" as Christopher Reeve has said.If I have any criticism at all, it is that Zwick chose to omit mention that Shaw was married only a few months before the end, which made his sacrifice even more poignant.

The scene at Fort Wagner is one of the most powerful I've ever seen in a film. This movie made me realize how much these men wanted to die for their country, and die for what is right. The fact that this is based on a true story made me cry even more. Real men had to go through this, and real men made life as we know it possible.

249,soapfan84,One of the most intricately perfect films,9,9 September 2004,"This is an ambitious film and is successful in everything it sets out to accomplish. Glory does not rely on the visual aspects to accomplish its perfection, but rather it relies on the emotional to convey its message and humanity. This is a film that managed to get some of the best actors of our time, as well as, withdraw from these actors their best abilities. While the film does show the realities and horror of war, especially when it involves good people thrown in, it captures the viewers attention by making us empathetic, as opposed to simply sympathetic. The score of the film is done by the brilliant James Horner, which compliments the film, but at times envelops the film completely. Director Zwick shows the various levels of humanity, one scene can display the blunt bravery of these men, and yet the next scene reminds us how scared and how human these men are. I wish I could write a paragraph on each actor, but I must mention Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washingtion, Andre Braugher, Cary Elwes, and Jihmi Kennedy. The characters of this film are wonderfully well-developed and the relationships between these men adds a dimension that is rarely seen in modern films. Each performance is Oscar-calibur, overall, this is a film that should now be ranked as a classic for all time. Simply amazing.",Glory

It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness.I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a cliché villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.",Glory
251,kylebarlow93,"Entertaining, a solid 7/10.",7,12 February 2012,"I thought 'Glory' was a good film, but it didn't explore the complete story of the war, granted it was focusing on the black soldiers, but nevertheless it should have showed more of the horrors of the American Civil War.The Confederacy weren't showed enough, they didn't have a character who was consistently in the story, they only had crowds of Confederate soldiers yelling Southern trash talk etc. How ever I do feel this film shows how a lot of Union soldier/politicians actually were. People are under the influence that all Union soldiers fought just for slavery to be abolished. That is not true, this film shows how many soldiers treated the Nigroes like they were nothing, that is the ugly truth, many soldiers went to war to preserve the Union or just to fight for their state.The story was sad and revealed the heroism of some of the Negroe(African-American) soldiers of the Union Armed Forces. Matthew Broderick's performance was brilliant, I feel his true character as an actor is of how many citizens/soldiers of the Northern states felt at the time.I'd recommend this film to someone who enjoys learning about the American Civil War and African-American heroes. I hope this review helps.",Glory
252,Midnight1992,The Greatest Civil War Film of all Time,10,27 October 2007,"If you haven't yet seen this film, prepare to be moved! James Horner composes arguably his best score (some think now that The New World or perhaps Braveheart top it) and it compliments the film in ways few other pieces can do. I should note that Morgan Freeman should have gotten the nod for best supporting actor here too, although Denzel did win for his role in this film which was much deserved for an excellent performance. Glory is the saga of the 54th Massachusetts regiment, a group of African-American soldiers who enlist to fight as Union soldiers for the chance to prove their worth in the chaotic times of the Civil War.Set against this tumultuous backdrop, the uniqueness of Glory lies not only in the subject matter at hand but the way Edward Zwick delicately develops the the balance of racial prejudices between the characters. Zwick is a master of character drama in a historical setting and uses his knowledge to enhance the script and the direction of the film, ultimately leading to one of the finest war films of all time. To say this is only a war film though denies Glory of its right to stand as one of the great race relations and character dramas ever recorded. For, without giving anything away, it is clear that each of the fine performances delivered on screen represent the characters whom in real life, whether black or white, so passionately wanted to preserve the Union for all Americans.10/10",Glory

The music was fantastic, and Edward Zwick did an amazing job directing the film. I wish I had watched it years ago, but perhaps now was the right time.

Until Glory the Civil War was often used as a backdrop to the story line and history suffered. As a retired soldier of 24 years I was most impressed with Jim Finn's portral of Sergeant Major Mulcahy, that is what a Regular army NCO of the 1860's was like.

If my review can get one more person to watch ""Glory"", then I will be happy.The acting is superb. Denzel Washington has always been a favorite of mine, and I believe he stole the show. However, Morgan Freeman and Matthew Broderick turned in wonderful performances as well.The score is as close to perfect as a movie score can be. You don't really notice it until after its over, or even until a second viewing, but the music is beautiful and truly enhances the emotion and action throughout.The story, well, that you just have to experience for yourself. Being a male under 21, I enjoy most war movies. But ""Glory"" stands out above the rest. The action is never entertaining or ""cool"", its brutal. People forget how horrible Civil War conditions were: no sterilized medical equipment, no anesthetic, and men literally being blown to pieces while standing in formation in the middle of a field.The development is what makes this movie. As the black regiment trains, becomes ready for combat, you as the viewer begin to feel frustration at the prejudice that is keeping them from action. As the white officers and the black soldiers spend more time together, you can see them build a mutual respect for each other.Finally, I know this might sound melodramatic, but this is the first movie to make me shed a tear since Fox and the Hound. These men actually went through this horror, and we seldom hear about them today. What the recent movie '300' has done for Spartans, I really wish 'Glory' would do for the first black battalions.One of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.",Glory

265,saminess123,Amazing Movie,10,20 November 2006,"Recently, my 8th grade class was learning about the Civil War. We had to do a big project involving a time line, and when I was doing research for this project, it didn't really mean anything to me. It was all names, dates, and places. I can be a very visual learner, and every time I came upon a new event or person I'd try and find a picture of it/them, as it helped me get a better idea of what happened. Still, what I read and learned truly didn't evoke any emotion in me.After we had finished and taken our big test, we got to watch this movie (after of course getting permission from all our parents seeing as it's rated R and we're in 8th grade). I cried at the end as did many people in my class, because the movie was so real, and what I (and I'm sure many people) felt for Col. Shaw and those soldiers was far deeper than anything else I'd felt when I was researching. Once I watched this, I looked back on my time line and I saw that I didn't include Ft. Wagner on it, I'm sure I'd read about it, but I didn't think it was important enough compared to Emancipation Proclimation, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, the Gettysburg Address, and all the other ""big"" events of 1863. When I looked it up in my book, I saw only a measly 2 paragraphs had been written about it. I figure that I would probably have never learned about or remembered this battle if it hadn't been for this movie.This movie has a different quality to it than most war movies have nowadays. Mostly, they're all gore and all-out violence, but this movie developed the characters so much that, in a sense, we felt we knew them. Even though everything about it wasn't explained, I learned so much from this movie. It was more effective than any lecture my teacher could've given or any book I could've read.I recommend this movie to any teacher looking to SHOW not TELL their students about the Civil War or any student interested in history, or really anyone looking for a good movie in general.",Glory

It's the kind of movies that moves you in many way that after seeing it you don't know exactly how to describe it to your friends to make them understand all his glory (no pun intended :p).Apart from the overall feeling of this movie, the acting is superb. Matthew Broderick does an impressive work walking away from his Ferris Bueller character. Denzel Washintong is flawless as a rebel and tortured young man and Morgan Freeman gives a full lesson about acting, as usual. Cary Elwes too gives a very good performance as Broderick's pal officer, and the rest of the cast is great, specially the actors who play the soldiers of the black regiment. The battle scenes, although not perfect, are very good and very epic.

269,serlingng,"A well-made film, but a gigantic ripoff of a music score",7,8 August 2005,"I enjoyed this movie very much, but I'm also aware that the music score written for it has been lauded by many as one of the finest scores James Horner has ever written. Why, then, do you suppose it didn't receive an Academy Award nomination? A score this prominent, on which viewers have heaped unstinting accolades, was ignored? Probably because the composers' arm of the academy doesn't view plagiarism that lightly. This score is rife with the kind of borrowings for which Horner has become notorious over the years. The main theme, heard prominently and developed throughout the ""Call to Arms"" and ""Forming the Regiment"" tracks (to name two on the CD release), is a transparent reworking of the ten-note theme of Aaron Copland's ""Fanfare for the Common Man."" In ""Brave Words, Braver Deeds,"" a melody from the Offertorium movement of Gabriel Faure's Requiem is utilized without alteration, appearing twice. The ""Burning the Town of Darien"" track lifts a chunk from Ralph Vaughan Williams' sublime ""Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis."" The entire ""Charging Fort Wagner"" sequence is another transparent rescoring by Horner, this time of the opening movement of Carl Orff's dramatic cantata ""Carmina Burana."" These are merely the ones I could identify. I'm no music historian; a sharper ear could likely pick out more. No mention is given, either in the liner notes to the CD or in the credits for the film, of these other composers. At least in films like ""Greystoke,"" ""Elizabeth,"" and ""Excalibur,"" the composers whose music got borrowed received a mention alongside that of the primary composer. When you read the credits of the old Errol Flynn film ""Captain Blood,"" you'll note that the composer, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, receives a title card that gives him credit for ""musical arrangement""--this, despite the fact that the music is almost entirely his. Korngold, pressed for time to meet his deadline, used a bit of Franz Liszt's music for a sword duel between Flynn and Basil Rathbone. The borrowed piece didn't amount to much, but Korngold insisted that he not be credited as composer, only as arranger. This was a man of integrity who wouldn't think of taking credit for another's work. The circumstances surrounding the scoring of ""Glory"" are unknown to me. Perhaps Horner had a tough deadline. Perhaps the director fell in love with the ""temp track"" and asked Horner to emulate those pieces instead of coming up with something original. It really makes no difference, though. A man of integrity would have demanded that those other composers receive their due credit. If you're going to stand on the shoulders of giants, you should be man enough to admit it.",Glory

Matthew Broderick did a fine job portraying colonel Shaw, as a young leader, who ultimately carries out the job he needed to do. Cary Elwes does a good job as Shaw's second in command, keeping Shaw grounded and off his 'high horse.' Denzel Washington was unbelievable with his performance as well. There's a scene in the movie where Trip (Washington) tells Shaw that he won't fight for him. but in the end, Trip is the first to CHARGE towards Fort Wagner after Shaw is brought down.

Some historical liberties may have been taken, but it is an outstanding story of courage, bravery, camaraderie and honor, as well as the horror that was the War Between the States.  From the opening scene to the last, the cinematography and the battle scenes are spectacular. Simply remembering the scene where the Confederate troops emerge from the smoke and haze in the forest during one of the battles scenes runs chills up and down my spine.

It was great to see them get the chance to fight for their country and receive the recognition and respect that they deserved. It was also interesting to learn about the civil war and the important role that blacks played in it. The outcome of the war definitely could have been different without them. All the actors were great especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The movie as a whole was phenomenal. It was one of the best war movies I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend it to someone else whose thinking about watching it.,Glory
278,aquaman343,This movie made me sad.,8,5 January 2015,"It was quite saddening the way everyone died.I did not expect Shaw to suddenly get shot like that.And then Trip had to go and lift the flag and get shot several times.But he just kept going.He kept going until he died too.And when I thought Forbes was going to make it, it just turns out that the Confederates win.They just go ahead and raise the Confederate flag next morning.It's so cruel.And then Shaw and Trip just get dumped in that huge together.It's heartbreaking, really.",Glory
279,ethanhatcher,Beautiful movie,10,16 December 2016,"My favorite Civil War movie, seconded by Gettysburg. The story telling is wonderful, it has a top notch cast, Broderick's boyish plays perfectly into Shaw's character, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington are at their usual best. Even in the heat of battle, you can tell one character apart for each other. Now for the depiction. It has the best combat of any Civil War movie, showing the chaos and blood. The storming of Fort (or Battery, depending on where you live) Wagner is brilliantly executed. The score is amazing when it kicks in throughout the movie p, especially when Shaw has been shot down and Trip rallies the troops, then they storm the fort. Hats of to the Harlem Boys Chior for the marvelous score. That scene remains my favorite scene from any war movie ever, including the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan. Historically, there are some flaws. The first action the 54th sees at James Island in the movie was a calvary charge, followed by a short line battle, and then a free for all. In reality, the 54th arrived relatively late, and mostly fought in a skirmish line. The movie has the advance on Wagner coming from the left, but it actually came from the right (I realize that's very nit-picky). And after Shaw got killed, the 54th lost steam and their attack founderd. The fort was actually breached by the 13th Connecticut, with a few members of the 54th finding a way to join them. But really, that's it. A superb movie, worth your time.",Glory

It is a must see for anyone who wants to learn more about the civil war and how slavery affected the will for these certain individuals to fight for a noble and just cause.it also has a beautiful score. Even if you never show emotion during movies, the wonderful story line and the score will bring out emotion no matter how hard you try to keep it in.

I first saw this movie years ago in my eighth grade social studies class expecting to see a mediocre war film only to find that I had been dead wrong. Matthew Broderick as Robert Gould Shaw was a great choice even if he was a younger man, it showed that he is a great actor with a great ability to portray many characters.Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman gave us another great view of their acting abilities as well.

Shaw was also very young in real life.  This was a war fought by men, but near the middle and end of it, when they finally allowed black soldiers to serve, boys were fighting as well.The final battle scene with Horner's music overlaying the action still gives me chills.

290,rkfs28,"Glory, Historically Incorrect Iin Many Ways",3,22 August 2000,"All too often Hollywood gets in the way of reality and history, such is the case with GLORY. The Federals attacked Ft. Wagner from the South. In the movie, it was from the north. Many of the uniforms that were worn by the principles in the movie were incorrect. Ft. Wagner was no more than 8 ft. high at it's highest point. In the movie, it was a 40 ft. high pile of dirt defended by numerous Rodman's. To make it look like the 54th troops were willing to die, courageous and were patriotic, Hollywood had them marching off to the attack, full well knowing they would die.... and loving it. In fact, they were not all that willing and had to be, shall we say, ""encouraged"" to lead the charge. Face it, negro troops were expendable then. Hollywood made it look like you saw it. In the movie where Matthew Broderick was talking to the newspaper reporter just before going into battle where he said something like; ""if I should fall, remember what you saw here today"". Did you see Matthew on the horse, nope ... he was on an 8 ft. ladder like you have at home...  Just a little movie trivia there. These are just a few of the run of the mill Hollywood bungles that happened in this movie as they do in all movies. Far from this movie to be the ""best war film ever"", Patton, North and South Books 1 & 2, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket were better. Even the blacks wouldn't for the most part go to see GLORY in the theater, they called it racist, why they would and how they could I have absolutely no clue ... what do they see that the majority of movie-goers don't??? Are they reading something into it that isn't there. I thought it was a good movie, not great but good.",Glory

294,scotte-81515,"Love Racial Differences and Similarities, Hope for All",10,8 December 2020,"Glory is an impactful movie that explores the dichotomy of race issues in America that should never be forgotten. The film is a glimpse of American Civil War history and the power of the promise of freedom. You cannot view this movie without experiencing an emotional reaction. For some, shame may evolve to pride, while others may feel anger that leads to hope. In our current environment, many need to be reminded of history to avoid mistakes from the past. Glory is a film that can teach everyone that inclusion and unity in a joint mission lead to acceptance and mutual respect.Glory explores the experience of the first black unit to fight in the Civil War. The movie reveals how the pursuit of freedom can lead to remarkable strength and perseverance, but the central theme is love and hope.Glory reveals the historical viewpoint of Colonel Robert Shaw, who was played by actor Mathew Broderick. The story has a strong sense of authenticity due to Colonel Shaw's historical letters and the inclusion of shameful behaviors in American history. The film starts with Colonel Shaw's white regiment taking a significant loss and how his experience leads to an opportunity to lead an all-black company. Some critics complain about having Colonel Shaw highlighted and suggested that his story reduced the significance of the black fighters' impact on the war. They are wrong. Colonel Shaw's letters and his eye-witnessed evidence of the black fighter's bravery and performance establishes proof and credibility to the story. Without his perspective, many could argue that the 54 defeat was due to poor performance. The black fighters demonstrated significant influence, motivating Colonel Shaw to tear up his paycheck in solidarity with the underpaid men who refused to accept less money than their white soldiers. I felt that Colonel Shaw developed a love for his men and hoped that their bravery would lead to all men's freedom.The story is powerful because we have an opportunity to see various perspectives from black soldiers. Morgan Freeman played an enlisted man promoted to Sergeant Major John Rawlins, and he was the mature informal leader and voice of reason that communicated well. Sergeant Major Rawlins commanded respect from everyone he encountered and was natural at bridging differences. Denzel Washington's character, Private Trip, was an angry young man that felt he had nothing to lose. Private Trip finds a sense of family with the men, and his strength and commitment to the mission become inspiring. Andre Braugher played Corporal Thomas Searles, and he started as a free man from the north. Despite his comfortable life, he chooses to serve, and we watch him toughen up to meet the needs of his unit as he fights for their freedom too.The men of the 54 regiment will have you rooting for them. You can't help but feel connected to them, and the fight scenes will have you on the edge of your seat.Glory's director and cinematographer capture the realism of the time-period and early American warfare. Some graphic scenes and the angles they used intensified the feelings of anxiety and threat experienced by these young men. There are morbid scenes that show the vantage point of men watching large groups approach in large numbers preparing to shoot. The film will have you on the edge of your seat, and you may yell at the men to reload.Imagine how we could set aside differences if our lives depended on each other. How can you not love or hope for the best for those that fight alongside you to keep you alive? If your life is not on the line, you will still enjoy the love and hope the film builds by revealing we are all the same. I highly recommend watching Glory!",Glory

What so strikes me after seeing the DVD again, is that after so many years - 23 - it is still as fresh and enjoyable and relevant as when first made. It was shot with so few frills that even now it still feels as if it could have filmed last year.But what most struck me after reading page of page of reviews is the consistent praise this movie receives. Nary a dissenting voice, just minor points discussed and then bypassed when the totality of the movie and story was taken into account.Rarely have I seen such virtual and consistent unanimity on the qualities of a movie, rarely such a consensus on it worth and value, on the beauty and honorable tale it tells.It must indeed be the best and most moving film ever made about the Civil War if so many reviewers agree.",Glory

298,MareNost,"This is a ""war movie"" that will not only entertain you perfectly but also leave you a better person!",10,8 March 2007,"To call ""Glory"" a ""war movie"" is akin to calling ""Hamlet"" a ""ghost story."" While it is true that it is a movie set in the Civil War and complete with realistic battle scenes, authentically reproduced uniforms and weapons, and a film that introduces the viewer to an important part of American history that had been more or less ignored--the roles that African-American soldiers played in the Union army--it is still so much more than that.I don't think I will ever find the precise words to indicate how satisfying and wonderful this film is and how much I love it. It is highly entertaining, moving, realistic, and downright transcendent in its beauty. Every actor does his job marvelously, from the amazing portrayal of ""Trip"" by Denzel Washington, to the steady, inspiring character that Morgan Freeman creates perfectly, to the baby-faced Colonel Robert Gould Shaw played with sincerity and intensity by Matthew Broderick, down to the minor role of the butt-kicking Irish drill sergeant who abuses his black recruits physically and verbally, calling them ""You Mexican African whores!"" and other lovely epithets. (That latter actor, incidentally, wanted so badly to be a part of the film that he offered to work for free!)I'm frustrated when I recommend this movie to friends and others and they respond with ""I don't like war movies."" Sure, Welles's ""Citizen Kane"" is a movie about business, and Chaplin's ""City Lights"" is about panhandling, not true?But like those two wonders, ""Glory"" tells its story perfectly, complete with great characters that you love, beautifully realized photography and action, and a deep, emotional wellspring that leaves a viewer lifted high above and beyond the TV room sofa. It is in my Top Five, and it is one of those films I just have to see every year or so, like the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy or ""Bridge on the River Kwai,"" or ""The Godfather"" movies. If you aren't thrilled to the depths of your being during the last ten minutes of this movie, then you don't have a pulse.It's just a great film, and if you've never seen it, do! It won't disappoint, and it will be etched in your memory forever. It is a masterpiece.",Glory
299,lightningtigress,Most moving war movie,10,26 April 2002,"Glory is by and far one of the most moving films I have seen in my entire life. The attraction and bond you feel with all the charectors is vividly brought to a halt at the ending battle. Althought many movies establish a  bond between charector and veiwer, Glory went astray of the main path and killed off all of the main charectors. Glory's only flaw was the similarity between Denzel Washington's charector and many of the other men in the 54th. This results in difficulty in diserning names and faces. However, the  bloodshed in the ending scene made for an excellent and tear-jerking ending.",Glory
300,reve_121,Emotional experience,9,23 December 2004,"There are few military films which allow us, the viewer, to explore our feelings and emotions on the total war experience. Glory, Patton, The Longest Day, explore and create great emotional value. Many more try to cash in on our emotional appeal as a commodity. Yeah, we'll watch Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot, Black Hawk Down, etc.,, and i hate to blasphemy these good, visually effective movies, but Glory is not out to exploit those senses. I love a good blow up movie, except not the actual movie BlowUP. Regards to Antonioni.Now take two anti-scenes as i like to call them. Denzel getting whipped. Kills me every time, those eyes of his, staring at Col. Shaw. Hate filled. The other ""colored"" soldiers are standing around watching not in acceptance as soldiers, but in acceptance as a sort of slave to the union. And we're wondering, will they be upset. Will the black soldiers try to leave again. Will they rise up in anger. There is a not only misunderstanding between the officers and the enlisted, but an absolute distrust. The officers are equal to the slave owners. My anit-scene is much later in the film. The soldiers have gathered around a fire and are praying to God, before battle. No imagery, just total emotion. Praising the Lord they know. Asking and praying, But not a single dissent about serving in the white man's army now. The have formed a proud military unit. Something most of us will never understand. And there is my emotional experience. Something i never imagined was part of the Civil War. The truth is I am compelled to feel too many emotions while watching this film. I would recommend this to anyone. and especially to those in the south.",Glory

What you can't get away from is the film is a moving one with a fantastic music score which compliments the feelings perfectly and can only do good for people who watch it nowadays and in the future. You have to have no soul not to be moved by this film. Hindsight is a wonderful thing we can sit here with a grasp of ""the bigger picture"" of the American Civil War and many other wars before or since.

304,mrmotionpicture,"""Glory"" is an important film for all Americans to see...",10,6 July 2009,"When I first heard of the film ""Glory"" all I saw it being was another war movie with plenty of action and re-enactments of historic battle scenes. Since I am a fan of these films I felt that I needed to see it. Ironically, I viewed this film only a day after the Fourth of July, a national holiday that celebrates the American spirit to the fullest. I can safely say that ""Glory"", a film based off the the true story of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry exemplifies what it truly means to be an American and fit in very appropriately with my Independence Day state of my mind.The Civil War was a dark point in American history. Not only did it force fighting among brothers, it was the deadliest military conflict America has ever engaged in. The goal of the war for President Lincoln was to end slavery in the South, but to ultimately preserve the Union. ""Glory"" begins with Matthew Broderick who brilliantly plays the young Col. Robert Shaw at the battle of Antietam where he witnesses the horror of war. Shortly after the disastrous battle, he returns to his home where he is offered the command of an all black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry. Shaw accepts the offer and the main plot of ""Glory"" commences.Broderick is perfect as Shaw because historically Col. Shaw was very young when he took command of the 54th. Broderick perfectly displays a young man who is forced to grow up and lead a group of hundreds of freed black slaves. He attempts to train them like typical Union soldiers and the recruits respond well, but when one recruit named Trip (Denzel Washington) disobeys orders, a severe punishment of flogging sends the whole regiment into painful memories of slavery. It is after Trip's lashing that the unit begins to grow together as one.""Glory"" is a great testament to the racism that plagued our nation during the Civil War. This is best displayed in the scene where Trip gets into a verbal conflict with a white Union soldier. Trip insists to the soldier that the 54th would win the war if they would be allowed to fight but the white soldier disagrees and a shoving match ensues. When I watched this I couldn't believe that racism could make men who were fighting on the same and would ultimately die together so hateful towards each other. This moment causes Trip to be condescending to his fellow regiment members as well for he has lost all confidence that he will ever get to fight for the nation he loves. Sgt. Maj. Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) clues Trip in on the fact that their white comrades fought to free the slaves and by doing so gave them the opportunity to serve in the 54th.The feel good moment of the movie however for me was when the 54th finally earns their right to fight and are included on a siege of Fort Wagner. The 54th knows this is their chance to prove themselves as soldiers and also as men. They volunteer to lead the assault even though they knew that their chance of survival would be low. As they marched through an assembly of white Union soldiers on the day of the attack one of the white men shouts, ""Give em' hell 54"" and the other soldiers join in. This is a triumphant moment in cinema for it is the first time that race was thrown out of the picture because they were together to the end...together they were free men...together they were Americans.By reading this review you should know by now that I am in love with this film and the lessons I learned from it will stick with me forever. It makes one point very clear...hatred will destroy us. It also beautifully shows how men can come together and form incredible bonds that last a lifetime. In the end of the film when the 54th is slaughtered by the Confederates at Fort Wagner they are buried in a mass grave outside the fort. The film first shows Shaw, the privileged white man from Boston, go in the grave. Next to follow him is one of his soldiers. Forever they would rest in that place together. That moment was very moving for me.Once again this film is extraordinary and the acting is superb. I can clearly see how this film jump started Denzel Washington's career because he was amazing as the conflicted Trip. Morgan Freeman was awesome as Rawlins, for once again he was a wise mentor, just like he is in every movie I see him in. It is full of great action sequences and one of the best story lines I have ever witnessed in a war film. If you haven't seen the movie go see it! 10 out of 10! Two thumbs up!",Glory
305,Cincyreds,My personal favorite movie/war movie ever. The absolute best.,10,13 June 2002,"Why is ""Glory"" my favorite war movie? Probably because I don't any other war movies. ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" are good movies but I don't like them. Those movies use to much special and computer fx for my taste. ""Gettysburg"" is too long, I think it was over four hours long, and just looked boring. ""Glory"" looked different. I first saw it in my 8th grade history class. Back then I did not pay close attention to it. A year later I saw it in a store and remembered the end. So I bought it and watched it with my dad (I'm 15).This time, which was a couple days ago, I payed close attention to the film and the messages it showed. After that I was hooked. The actors were stupendous.All of them really hit their spots. From Matthew Broderick to Cary Elwes, and from Denzel Washington to Morgan Freeman. All of them got the characters emotions down. You can't forget Andre Braugher and Jihmi Kennedy who portrayed their characters excellently.The music/score is perfect. At the end it almost wants to make you cry. This is now, which I am proud to say, my favorite movie of all time. My previous favorite movie was, get this, a horror movie. It was ""Halloween"" 1 & 2. ""Glory"", in my mind, should go down as one of the greats of all time. It should also go down as a true classic. My rating: 10/10",Glory

The film grabs hold of your emotions early on and never lets go. Especially impressive is Jame Horner's musical score (one of the best in cinema history, in my opinion).""Glory"" is an example of perfectly crafted dramatic storytelling: for example, the growth of each character is what makes this film so truly powerful. The audience witnesses the painful hardships that these men have to overcome in order to earn respect and the right to fight, all leading up to an unforgettable climax that will leave you stunned and breathless.

Even some of the guys in my class were touched and so they cried, not saying that crying is a bad thing, but that it was that emotional.In the end, it was a great movie to view I enjoyed watching it and hope to get the movie soon so I can show my family, how great the movie is.",Glory

The attention to detail in the battle scenes is amazing and there was not a week performance by anyone in the cast. I would recommend this movie to any Civil War buff or anyone else who loves a great movie.",Glory
311,benlh1978,Totally moving,10,14 January 2003,"What a beautiful film, It's a shame that Matthew Broderick hasn't had another opportunity to sink his teeth into a role like this.

312,lenoradusk,Simply Amazing - Among the Best War Films Ever,10,2 December 2009,"Every element is stunningly perfect in this must-see film for history fans and everyone else. Starring Matthew Broderick, ""Glory"" tells the poignant story of the Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Regiment and their role in a half forgotten battle that, in Lincoln's own words, changed the tide of the war.The entire cast was incredible in their unforgettable roles. If you are turned off by ""seeing Ferris Bueller play soldier"", think again. Broderick plays a perfect Shaw from personality right down to appearance. The story may be based on Shaw's letters, but Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, Andre Braugher, and Jhimi Kennedy add dimension to the Civil War by bringing their diverse characters to life because it really is a rich man's war and a poor man's fight.The action is disappointing only if you watched expecting to see the blood and gore that many war films exhibit. Violence is a very real part of war, but it goes so much beyond that. That is what we see in ""Glory"". Even beneath the messages against bigotry, we see the basic human nature, and that itself speaks for equality. Despite their differences, the rich, privileged white Harvard men, the runaway slaves with chips in their soldiers, and the intelligent freemen with class all face the same danger. Death does not discriminate, but people do, and that's what they're all fighting against.James Horner's composing is possibly at its best in ""Glory"", as his soundtrack sums up the terrors, courage, souls, and yes, glory of war in music alone. It makes the touching parts all the more poignant with its tear jearking element.It cannot be said enough times: ""Glory"" is spectacular, amazing, mesmerizing, shocking, wonderful, and stunning in every way a film should be. Few movies, history or otherwise, can compare. You have to watch it to believe it. 10/10",Glory
313,sisco035,Civil War Regiment,9,7 October 2009,"The Civil War was probably the most important, and deadliest war in United States history. This war can be found in many arguments as the very ending of slavery.The film Glory directed by Edward Zwick, which has to be the best Civil War film of all time, was based in 1863. Robert G. Shaw was appointed Colonel of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment which was a volunteer colored regiment that was offered money to fight for the union army. Shaw and his commanding officers prepared these men for battle, but it was very difficult since Shaw's superior officers refused to provide his men with boots and socks because they were for colored men. Robert Shaw was told by many other regiment officers that his men would never fight a battle because they were colored. The 54th regiment finally received orders to a possible battle after Shaw threatened to reveal his commanders secret of unlawfully war tactics. They surprised many with their stunning first battle victory. Colonel Shaw than volunteered his men to be the first wave attack on Ft. Wagner, which was unsuccessful.This film had many intentions, but it's main focus was the level of racism during those times. Even though these men were volunteering their lives to fight for the Union Army, they were still degraded because the color of their skin. It was amazing to see what great pride these colored soldiers still had within them even while racism was among them.This movie was great, especially if you care to know the significance of history, and how things that has happened in the past made the United States what it is today. Films like this definitely shows the struggles African-Americans acquired during there lives before and during the Civil War. Edward Zwick did a wonderful job showing the audience in as much detail as he could, a bit of what the war was like, while showing the difficulties of being a colored person before and during the Civil War.",Glory
314,saxyone,The Human Experience,10,14 March 2003,"While ""Glory"" was an entertainment event that seems as though it was intended to tell the story of a Black American experience at a time when the Union was still in a developmental stage, I felt that the premise was to give an example of the content of character of a group of individuals, in addition to the film's relationship to American history. After having said that, the aesthetic value I placed on the movie was that in light of the adversity that the men in this situation had to endure, they still managed to exhibit a monumental amount of integrity, and this movie does its part to show that this human quality does have its place in history. Yes, the movie may have its subtile historical inaccuracies (and as far as history is concerned, who's to say to what degree is one account more accurate, relevant, or truthful than another) but anyone who looks at this movie will have to agree that ""Glory"" was one of the best MOVIES made, let alone qualifying it as a ""war movie."" The movie seemed to draw its audience in so deeply that you  felt empathy, without even having gone through the experience first-hand. While watching this movie, I realized a smorgasboard of emotions; I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I cheered. There was not a weak link in the cast, and I personally saw a side of Matthew Broderick's acting ability that I was refreshingly pleased to see...and as far as Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Cary Elwes are concerned, their credentials speak for themselves. Even if you don't find war flicks particularly palatable (and actually, I'm one of those who don't) trust me, this picture ain't about war, it's about the human experience.",Glory

This person, to me, knows nothing about the history behind the story of Glory and it shows in how he comments about it.  I am finishing up my B.A. in History in college, and my senior year, i did a research project on Blacks in the American Civil War. From the books, journals, letters, diaries, and more that i have read on the subject, what happened in Glory was very close to the full truth.  Growing up, Glory was one of my most favorite movies, but after learning the full story from my research, i gained a new found respect for the movie, and the truth behind it.The movie is very accurate.  From the training, to the discrimination by the US army with supplies and them receiving lesser pay than white soldiers, because they were black.  the fight scenes and the truth of each person's character that was shown in the movie is very accurate.  From being seen as nothing more than slaves or secondary citizens....to gaining the respect from all those that surrounded them.  Their courage and sacrifice really is unappreciated in this day and time.  If you want to learn something worth the time...watch this movie",Glory

In my opinion Glory is the best war picture ever made.  It depicts an often-forgotten, but important aspect of the Civil War.  As far as being historically accurate, I would give it an 8.5/10.  (at the end of the film it says the fort was never taken...this is incorrect).The acting was magnificent, and was to be outdone only by the musical score. Unlike most movies about the Civil War it was not 4 hours long and did not contain a lot of scenes depicting false patriotism, etc.  This is most evident in the scene where Col. Shaw asks Tripp(Denzel) to carry the flag, and he declines.The characters are memorable, especially Morgan Freeman's and also the Irish Sgt.  This movie is an absolute must see.

This movie is what got me hooked into being a Civil War buff.I cannot believe that it was not even nominated for best picture; and that Driving Miss Daisy was and won!  I have seen both films and Glory is most definitely the better of the two.

319,logan-mcvey2197,Not Your Typical Civil War Story,8,5 January 2014,"Glory, directed by Edward Zwick, follows Robert Gould Shaw through his journey of leading the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first all black infantry in the Civil War. The film begins on the fields of Antietam where Robert watches men die and is grazed by a bullet himself. He lies by the dead and hides until an unknown black man, hired by the Union to bury the dead checks to see if he is alive. While his injuries are being treated he learns that President Lincoln plans to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all slaves in rebelling states. While attending a party in Boston the Governor of Massachusetts, John Andrew, and Fredrick Douglas approach Robert about leading the first all black infantry. He accepts and is promoted to colonel. After gaining enlisted men, the first of whom is one of Robert's friends, the new regiment goes through boot camp. Not long after training began the Confederate Congress issued a proclamation stating that any slave who was caught fighting for the union would be returned to his owners, if they were in a Union uniform they were to be killed. All white officers in charge of the black regiments would be executed as well. At this point Robert tells the men that anyone who wishes to leave may do so without consequence, but the next morning he awakens to find all of his men still at camp ready for training. Once the men are trained they begin to ask when they will get their uniforms and guns. One man is caught trying to find shoes and is whipped because the commanders thought he was deserting. At this point the gravedigger who saved Robert named, John Rawlins, shows him the need for shoes and Robert confronts the quartermaster for holding out on them. Rawlins becomes the liaison between the black troops and the white commanders ,and is later unofficially promoted to Sergeant Major since blacks could not hold higher ranks. For a while things get better and the soldiers get their guns and blue uniforms, but then pay is issued. A white soldier would have been paid $13 for their services, but the colored soldiers are only paid $10. Trip, the soldier that was whipped, is infuriated by this and tells his comrades to rip their checks. Robert wins the men's respect by saying that if they refuse their pay no one in the group will take theirs.As bonds within the group grow the tension from outside begins to grow. White soldiers outside the group scoff and belittle the colored soldiers saying they will never see any action and are only there to do chores like scavenging supplies. After bribing some officials Robert gets the men some action, but their first skirmish is overshadowed by the Battle of Gettysburg. As generals begin planning the attack on Fort Wagner, Robert volunteers his men for the dangerous mission of being the first troops in. As they began to head out the next morning they finally earn the support of the white troops. Before they depart Robert leaves a journalist with his letters and accounts so that the world can know what happened with the 54th. He then gets off his horse and stands with his men during the attack. Though the attack on Fort Wagner was a failure, the 54th fought bravely which helped pave the way for more black troops whom Lincoln credited with helping turn the tide of the war.This movie for the most part is accurate, because it was written using some of Robert Shaw's actual letters. It correctly illustrates a timeline from Antietam to Fort Wagner. It is also very accurate on important dates for African Americans during the war like the Emancipation Proclamation and General Orders No. 111, which is only partly mentioned as the confederate congress's proclamation. This proclamation could also be considered an inaccuracy to some degree. It was really aimed at General Benjamin F. Butler and his men due to their hostilities towards southern women. Another inaccuracy appears at the end of the film at Fort Wagner. The movie leads one to believe that the 54th was completely annihilated, however in reality only 272 of the 600 men were captured, killed, or wounded.Glory leaves out the beginning and end of the war, but there isn't really anyway to correct this within the context of the movie since it is following the African American involvement in the war. One thing that could have been included was a brief follow up on other black regiments that formed due to the 54th and their bravery. The movie was very accurate and gave good context to the battles that were important to Robert Shaw and the 54th,which means that a lot of important events like Gettysburg were swept under the rug. It also covers the most important issue during this time, slavery and views of blacks, very well. It shows how even though the North was fighting to free slaves they still thought less of them which can often be forgotten and left out of the history books. In my opinion Glory is a great movie. It provides a new perspective to the war and focuses on more than just Gettysburg, Lincoln, and other major battles that we have all heard about. It praises the unknowns of history which I love. The fact that the director chose to use Robert Shaw's letters not only to make the script accurate, but also as voice overs to provide insight into feelings at the camp makes the movie seem so much more real. It does however end very sadly. I cried for the last ten minutes of the movie and so I can't say that it would be one to watch with friends or if you're looking for something happy, but if you want something that is historically accurate and an underdog success story of sorts this is the way to go.",Glory

The cast was second to none. I have to say in my perspective actors such as Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman were instrumental along with the rest of the cast and crew in making Glory one of the best civil war depictions next to Gettysburg and Gods and Generals. By the end of the war over 620k American casualties were counted. Some wore blue some wore gray all American. Superior acting all around/great director.

321,adamncarter123,Excellent storytelling,7,14 September 2020,"Glory is a must see Civil War movie. Do I think it's the best civil war movie like many others have claimed? No. It's a great movie with a great story made all the better by the fact that it is a true story. But there are simply too many inconsistencies and historical inaccuracies for me to give it a higher rating. I may be in the minority here, but I love war movies that try to be as accurate as possible such as Dunkirk. You can never be perfect when it comes to historical screenplays but you can certainly tell when a director tries their best to be historically accurate down to the small detail. Glory is historically accurate in its story but as far as civil war movies go, it is not on the top of the list for accurate details. Call me nit picky if you must but these inaccuracies tend to throw me off when I should be paying attention to the movie rather than wondering why a South Carolina regiment is flying a Tennessee rebel flag or why the soldiers don't have bayonets mounted on their guns and just as they charge bayonets magically appear. I'm certainly not a civil war expert or a war expert in general but if I can see these inaccuracies than the director should have as well.",Glory

I felt empowered when Thomas became the first draftee for the 54th. I was excited watching the regiment destroying the Confederates during their skirmish. I felt Thomas' pain when he was shot for the first time. I was proud of Pvt. Trip when he was asked to be the flag bearer for the regiment.

Why are all the black man so proud to be able to go to war, killing and being killed as any other man? That seems to me like joining the futile to the unpleasant. Even the educated black failed to see a new form of oppression on his race. And the final assault was just ridiculous... ""I request the honor of leading the assault"".. It looked like the old strategy of sending the cannon fodder first.

The face of the defiant trip, as his shirt is ripped from his back, the scars revealed and the whip unleashed.Shaw comes off as a dick to begin with, he is young, not a hardened vet, yet his reasons for it in the end are very clear. They were not slaves, they were given freedom but then enlisted which effectively gave it away. They did it to fight for the right for others to have it. He owed it to them to make them into a hardened troop.All round classic and would recommend to anyone.

This movie is by far the best Civil War movie and the best war movie of the past several decades with only Saving Private Ryan possibly eclipsing it.The storyline, acting, and cinematography are all outstanding. There are no long, drawn out battle scenes, moments of corny humor, or wasteful moments spent on subplots that do nothing to further the story. The story begins with Colonel Shaw and the arrival of the first black regiment. You get to know the characters and their diverse backgrounds. There are powerful scenes and sequences that will give you chills (especially at the end of the film).Several actors in the film could have and should have won nominations. This was Matthew Broderick's best performance, even eclipsing his iconic turn as Ferris Bueller. Morgan Freeman deserved a best supporting actor nod for playing the part of a senior member of the regiment. Denzel Washington won the academy award for Best Supporting Actor and very deservedly so. I don't think you could replace him in this movie.Writers of war movies should look hard at this movie to truly understand how to build a story around a core group of individuals and to pace a movie to create a sense of anticipation.

The scene at the end is what got to me and made this one of my top 5 films of all time. When Matthew Broderick galloped up to the shoreline before the last battle and looked out into the ocean and the approaching sunset, I just lost it. Through his eyes you can see a man looking out at the sunset for the last time in his life and with a foreshadowing knowledge that he would not live to see the sunrise again.

The fight scenes are terrible. Not impressed at all. I couldn't feel for the characters either. My teacher expected our class to be moved and nobody really was. As I expected. It is not gripping at the beginning which makes it tedious to watch. Maybe it is just me, but I cannot find why this movie is any good.

We see why people are willing to make sacrifices, if need be, by fighting for what they believe and for the freedom of future generations. He also feels that with demonstrated emotion, history is not just dates and places and oft times misunderstood. Giving students an opportunity to connect and feel the emotions demonstrated by these incredible interpreters, course lessons will have more significance. I agree with him, as do countless students in his classes. This is one of the best movies ever made. In addition to the theme of freedom, the depiction of historical relevance, the incredible performances of Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick, as well as all of the other superb cast members, cannot be emphasized enough.

329,zandershaw,The Debacle of Glory,1,18 September 2014,"The Civil War movie ""Glory"" depicts the Colonel Robert Gould Shaw as he leads the first all- black regiment of soldiers. It is a deplorable attempt to romanticize war, causing only shame and disrespect to the men it attempts to honor.The debacle of ""Glory"" begins with the casting, specifically Mathew Broderick's disgraceful portrayal of Colonel Shaw, whose monotonous and phlegmatic character is a burden to watch. But the show must go on. The film barely stays afloat, being carried by the performances of Pvt. Trip (played by the glorious Denzel Washington) and Sgt. Rawlins (Morgan Freeman). The highlight of the movie is by far the scene before the final attack; Washington's character emotionally proclaims that his fellow soldiers are his only family. Now that's what I call acting! Tears aside, this is a clear example of director Edward Zwick trying to connect emotionally to the audience. The soldiers know they will be facing heavy casualties in the upcoming battle. Instead of creating a realistic scene showing the fear of the men as they face their own mortality, Zwick uses the opportunity to score some ""heart points"" to create a more relatable and soulful scene.Furthermore, the mere fact that ""Glory"" is narrated through the perception of Shaw is yet another reason it is such a fiasco. This movie is supposed to portray the first all African American regiment; yet it is told through the point of view of the privileged and naïve white Colonel. Although this adds some interesting character development for Shaw, it distances the audience from what should be the focus of the movie. There are very interesting dynamics between the soldiers, such as how the educated Thomas interacts with the former slave Trip. It would have been insightful to further explore the racism and hate betwixt fellow black soldiers. The movie touches on this, but not in depth enough because the main focus is on Shaw. As mentioned before, the fatal flaw of ""Glory"" is that it romanticizes war. Although it has a harsh and realistic depiction of some of the day-to-day aspects of being a soldier, and some gory battle scenes, in the end, war is portrayed as glorious and honorable. At the outset of the movie, Shaw is a bad Colonel, and the 54th is a mess of a regiment. Zwick expects us to believe that after some harsh training, the soldiers have bonded enough to become friends, who fight together for a noble cause. This is complete crap. This entire arc is ill thought out, and poorly executed. It is the trivial and unoriginal theme that people will struggle, but then come together and be stronger. Zwick is making much ado about nothing. This is misplaced; and with all the brutality and harshness in war, it would take much more for this group of men to come together. Also, Zwick tries to show that you can achieve glory from battle. But there is no glory when it comes to death. During the last battle, Shaw yells, ""For the 54th!!"" before he runs up a hill to his death. We are expected to believe that his death is somehow courageous, and propels his men to be courageous also. This seems like mockery to me. And the constant choir music in the background is inglorious and shameful to the actual people who fought in this battle. The last scene of the movie shows Trip and Shaw, who previously quarreled, both dead, but lying on one another, as though they are friends, who died peacefully for an honorable cause. Yet another example of Hollywood trying to appeal to the masses. Come on, people; get over it!",Glory
330,corellianjedi,Absolutely Amazing. Flawless Film.,10,15 October 2005,"Without a doubt, one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It easily tops my list of greatest war movies. There are a handful of films I consider to be perfect, flawless movies--Glory is one of them.The acting is superb. The scenes flow smoothly, no choppy editing; the dialogue is brilliant and contains the right amount of humor; no shoddy special effects (my biggest problem with modern day movies) to ruin the feel of authenticity; no over-the-top action scenes; and finally, James Horner's score is absolutely breathtaking--the crowning jewel of one amazing movie.Matthew Broderick completely blew me away. The emotional intensity behind his eyes and facial expressions is incredible. The beach scene before the charge on Fort Wagner comes to mind--some brilliant acting right there. To be able to perform roles as polar opposite as Ferris Bueller and Robert Gould Shaw really demonstrates his range (and underratedness) as an actor. He brilliantly captured a young man striving to do the right thing in midst of war, to do his duty and fulfill his responsibility to his men, while having personal doubt and uncertainties at the same time. For me, as far as acting and character go, he was the highlight of the movie. The director could easily have made him a perfect, Hollywoodized action hero, but instead the character remains human--he has fears, he has uncertainties, and he doubts himself just as we all do. He's not a Bruce Willis or a John Wayne--it is very refreshing and realistic, and most of all, true to the character, true to the real Robert Gould Shaw revealed in his memoirs.Morgan Freeman is, as always, a joy to watch. He has long been one of my favorite actors, and he truly shines in this movie. His character is one of the most memorable, aside from Denzel Washington's, who also delivered an amazing performance. He earned that Oscar, no question. Never once did I think of these men 'acting', it is so natural.If you haven't seen this one, go rent it, or better yet, buy it. You won't be disappointed.

For example, in the beginning of the movie when Gould Shaw was asked to lead the 54th regiment, he without much thought, said yes practically on the spot. When in reality he contemplated his decision for a while before making the decision. Another flaw is when the 54th attacks fort Wagner. They attacked it from north to south when they actually attacked it from south to north.Another minor hiccup in the movie was when all of the African American soldiers are talking in the tent 4 out of 5 said they were runaway slaves but in reality almost all the slaves fighting in the 54th were born free men from the north. Another example was when they were passing out the guns to the soldiers they said the serial numbers of the guns but they didn't start putting serial numbers on guns until the civil war was over.But none the less a great movie. If your the kind of person who likes a good war or action movie or even a history buff you'd love this movie. There is action all the way through. Matthew Broderick plays a convincing leader in the role of Gould Shaw.Its hard not to watch a Matthew Broderick movie and not keep thinking Bueller...Bueller but he definitely sells the role here and makes for a great Robert Gould Shaw. And the casting choices in this movie were superb. Denzel Washington plays a very powerful and convincing role the only role that I enjoyed more was his part in training day. And Morgan Freeman what ever role he is in its amazing weather its the Sgt. in glory or big red in shawshank he is just a phenomenal actor. If your searching for a movie to watch I would definitely give this one a look.",Glory
337,kyleyes,Struggles of the colored in the Civil War,8,19 December 2015,"In the movie Glory, the Fifty-Fourth regiment consists of colored soldiers who endure discrimination of their own army. I found the movie very captivating because of its accuracies and action scenes. IO loved how they showed the guts and the blood to make the battle scenes more effective to the viewers. If you do not like to see those kinds of images I would not recommend this to you. I like how they portray the scenes and that there is anticipation and excitement every time. This is one of my favorite historical movies I have seen because of all these things I just mentioned. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a thirst for knowledge about the Civil War. Just be aware of the guts and blood in some parts of the movie.",Glory
338,skyfall-57475,Accurate and Moving Portrayal of the 54th Regiment,8,20 December 2015,"Based off of the letters of Colonel Robert Shaw, Glory is a highly entertaining movie with only a few minor historical inaccuracies. Although the movie is mainly from the perspective of Colonel Shaw, a white man, it brilliantly portrays the struggles the 54th Regiment faced from both the Confederate Army and their own army, as well as exemplifying the courage and bravery the 54th Regiment showed. Overall, Glory is an excellent, though bloody, portrayal of the 54th Regiment. However, it does include some historical inaccuracies. For example, the movie depicts the 54th as a regiment comprised of uneducated, runaway slaves and many of the main characters are runaway slaves. However, in reality, those enlisted in the 54th were educated, free blacks living in the North. Additionally, in the movie, Shaw is seen to accept the position of leading the 54th almost immediately upon being offered it. In reality, Shaw contemplated this decision for a while, even declining the job at first before later changing his mind.Despite these inaccuracies, however, Glory does an excellent job portraying the struggles the 54th faced. The movie shows how the Confederate army threatened death to any black soldier or white officer commanding black soldiers. Additionally, the movie includes many scenes that show the unfair treatment of black soldiers including unequal pay, the difficulties in receiving proper equipment and supplies, and the racism found in many white units.And yet, the most amazing aspect of this movie is its ability to inspire. At its heart, Glory is about the ability of the men in the 54th regiment to show their indomitable spirit and courageous behavior. The men suffer through hardships on and off the battlefield, but they continue to show immense camaraderie and hope for the future. With the culminating battle of the movie, the 54th is able to prove to everyone that they too possess the courage needed for warfare.Glory is a wonderfully created film with an amazing cast and many epic battle scenes. While the movie does contain many gory scenes, the underlying events are worth the blood and guts in this movie.",Glory
339,arccny,Captivating and Inspirational,8,21 December 2015,"The movie Glory provides an enthralling perspective of the morals and beliefs encompassing the Civil War and more dominantly of the 54th regiment, the first African American troop, based upon letters of Colonel Shaw and novels ""Lay This Laurel"" by Lincoln Kirstein and ""One Gallant Rush"" by Peter Burchard. Despite the few historical inaccuracies, such as the rushed acceptance of the commanding position by Colonel Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and the discrepancy in which the first regiment dominantly consisted of freedmen, not runaway slaves, as inferred by the numerous of soldiers portrayed in the movie with this similar background, such as John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and Trip (Denzel Washington), the movie was both captivating and inspirational.Through the perspective of Colonel Shaw, viewers have the opportunity to understand the 54th regiment through the eyes of a white man. Although not biased against his inferior soldiers, the movie emphasizes his softening attitude towards them and his changing views as he sees his soldiers as equals and judges them for their character and heart despite the color of their skin and faults. The director does not attempt to hide the truth from his viewers or enforce an opinion upon them. He emphasizes the secondary treatment and views of white men on the regiment and does not disguise the profanity, but preserves the language of the time period portrayed.The fighting scenes, although slightly gory and intense, are not the strongest aspects of the movie or meant to be the main focus of it. The movie relies heavily on character development specifically of the African American soldiers. The actors used, perfectly portrayed the characters they played and the chemistry between the soldiers is what makes the story line. Of the entire regiment, what stands out the most are Rawlins' as the silent leader, Thomas Searles' (Andre Braugher) scholarly, loyal personality, Jupiter Sharts' (Jihmi Kennedy) minor parts as the hot shot shooter and contagious enthusiasm, and the complex character of Trip. This connection and interaction between the characters, despite the aforementioned adversities, provides a different perspective of the Civil War, through the influence of African Americans on their white colonel, is truly what makes this movie a must-see.",Glory
340,ghoefleincc,Poignant,9,21 December 2015,"Beautiful storyline paired with captivating cinematography. The immediate change of scenes between the experience of black troops and white high society of the time made for an effective plot device and was able to capture the gap between blacks and whites. It also displayed the gap between free black men and former slaves, which eludes to the sectionalism within the country. This movie has given me a better understanding of the Civil War.This movie is worth watching, I watched this movie with good friends of mine. We all agree that the best snack choice for this movie are waffle fries. Just in case you wondered. Glory clearly deserved every award it won.",Glory
341,platypus-99766,"Captivating, but problems with volume",7,3 January 2016,"The film shows a great interpretation of how the 54th Massachusetts Regiment fought in the Civil War, and also how they fought to remain in the Union despite the fact that they were almost entirely African-American. The story narrows in on a small group of soldiers and their captain in the regiment, and as they are tempered by their training, punishment, and combat, viewers will become quite fond of the group. Sadly, the regiment is crushed at the battle of Fort Wagner tragically. The focus on this group betters the film by investing the viewers and allowing for more character development, but from an educational perspective, does not present the mood of the progress of the entire regiment and the fight for wartime racial equality as a large group as much as I would have liked. Overall though, the movie is apparently quite accurate to history, with few minor details that are not emphasized (except a whipping scene, for whipping was outlawed in the Union due to its symbolic reference to slavery). I give it a 7 of 10 because the movie itself was an 8 in my opinion, but the dialogue was too quiet, and especially in the louder combat scenes, this was a hindrance enough to remove me from the film momentarily.",Glory
342,graceporrazzocc,Glory is great,10,2 January 2016,"I have to say Glory is my favorite war movie. The beginning hits the audience right away with its opening scene of the battle and the movie picks up and does not slow down. The development of the plot kept me intrigued - how the enlisted men depicted as runaway slaves transform into a skilled army and show their ability to fight in combat. The characters for me are what really make it, especially Matthew Broderick, who plays the regiment's leader: Col. Robert Gould Shaw. It is not only his young age that fits the Colonel. His performance is mature and he fits the young military man perfectly. His character is poised and he shows he leads the army almost hesitantly and timidity. But later in the movie, his pride in his men develops, and you can see how he is prepared to lead his troops and die with them.Morgan Freedman as well does a remarkable job with his ability to convey such emotion to the other troops as his character, John Rawlins, who becomes Sgt. Major. He is the one who unites the army. Furthermore, Tripp, a runaway slave is weary to trust and respect the white officers. The one scene when he and the other black men tear up their checks in response to receiving less pay than the white troops, really marks a turning point. Shaw tears up his own check and the men cry out in joy. Glory is action filled and really is glorious. The battles are intense and patriotic, especially the final scene at Fort Wagner. Every character is brilliant in this fight, as each one of them shows such pride and devotion for their country. This movie is a must see, both for the action, plot, and characters.",Glory
343,moore-92599,The movie is based in the Civil war era on black soldiers in the military and how they fight for freedom even facing racial adversities.,8,1 January 2016,I think this movie was excellent in telling how blacks were treated differently than white soldiers during the war an example is when they find out the pay difference of whites to black and how they boycott receive checks until they receive the same amount of money. They also show throughout the movie how some whites reflect on how they treat blacks. The movie tells a great story of a very heroic Black regiment that facing racial adversities still believe in the cause of freedom enough to fight for it. Enough so they fought in a battle in south Carolina that was considered suicidal but with extreme discipline and many loses they took they hill. This made it so the union drafted many more black soldiers into the fight .,Glory
344,houseofcollins-79048,An Excellent Civil War Film!,9,2 January 2016,I thought the movie gory was excellent well paced movie with a very emotional story. During the movie you get to know some of the characters very personally and learn about each of the characters individual hardships. I also go to see how the 54th regiment went from people who were very to themselves to one giant family. Whether it be sharing prayers around the fire. The movie glory also does a great job showing the amount of discrimination that was going during the war. Like when one of the suppliers for the military refused to give the black soldiers because he thought it was funny. Also the fact that they weren't even gonna have the 54th regiment fight until the leader of the regiment blackmailed one of the higher officials was only when they were finally allowed to fight on the front. Overall I thought the movie was excellent and I definitely recommend anyone thinking about watching it to watch it.,Glory

It showed the way wars used to be fought with the standing in lines even whilst getting cut down by fire, and the action scenes were amazing. The practical effects were great and I really liked the focus on black only regiments and how the helped the war effort, and through Freeman the different viewpoints on that. When the soldiers stormed Fort Wagner, and when Col. Shaw dies and Pvt. Trip continues the charge to win the battle, really showed that they could put aside their differences for a greater cause. Also when they were being buried in the mass grave, It exemplified the fact that Trip and Shaw could both do what needed to be done, and put aside their petty ideas.",Glory

Matthew Broderick plays the main character of Robert Gould Shaw so amazingly, it's the actors that make the movie so grand. Denzel Washington (Private Trip) really brings out the life of a African American during the era of the civil war. Conflict between blacks and whites is prominent. What makes the movie so appealing is not the action or battle scenes, it is the drama between characters. Internal conflict between Shaw and his own regiment reveals how racist or anti slavery the people are. The scene where Shaw rips his paycheck in protest to his men receiving smaller pay than white men shows his support for the freedom of his men. On the other hand commanding officers treat the 54th regiment as soldiers not worthy of uniforms or weapons. During the movie the bond between Shaw and his men grow to the point where they will die for each other. Glory demonstrates the historical drama between two races fighting for the same cause - their union.",Glory

The hardships and cruelty the soldiers face in the movie showed me a side of the Civil War I'd never really known before.The emotional aspect of this movie is what makes it so great. It is amazing to see the transformation of Trip, as he goes from being a rebellious soldier to a soldier that is proud of who he is and what he is fighting for. It is also incredible to feel the sense of accomplishment that the soldiers had at Fort Wagner, even though they lost a lot of men and the battle.Overall, this was an amazing movie and I am very glad I watched it.",Glory

Through a great seen in which Shaw leads his men to die it shows off the true bravery of the 54th regiment.

350,dabterrik,Colonel Robert Shaw leads the 54th regiment to create history,9,21 December 2016,"Glory was an amazing movie. It really got in depth on the cruelness of the civil war. Brave men gave their lives away to fight in a war for freedom. The 54th regiment was a group of black men who had volunteered to fight for the Union. Under the command of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the men were trained harshly at times, but were prepared for war. The fact that these men stayed with the 54th knowing the possible outcomes of death and sacrifice was amazing. They were all brave to fight for not only their freedom, but for the freedom of others. Shaw had well disciplined the men and lead them to a glorious battle to take over a fort in Charleston Harbor. They were not successful but they all fought with courage and bravery, willing to die for their freedoms. Shaw was a great commander and leader and lead his men to the creation of history. Showing that with determination and courage, you can create a powerful bond between soldiers and men. They all fought hard and did all they could. In the end they may have failed but their spirits were left for the name of freedom for all.There was a perfect amount of action and suspense. The amount of detail in the movie was amazing and all of the actors played their characters as if they were that person. Each personality in the movie fit well with the Civil War time period and the movie was a great watch. The story was not slow and it kept' me engaged and to want to keep watching.

351,nathanlockwoodcc,The Best War Movie I've Seen (Glory),8,2 January 2017,"I really liked this movie and i believe that it doesn't get the credit it deserves. In my opinion the acting was phenomenal. The camaraderie between the members of the 54th infantry regiment and their leaders during the multiple battles really helped create a clear central idea or main theme from the movie. This main idea would be that without racial barriers, a group of people can accomplish so much more and can make everlasting bonds and friendships. This movie was the best war movie that i've ever watched mostly because it shows black and white men unifying together in order to preserve the Union of the United States and also to abolish slavery. I also loved to see some of my favorite actors in the movie which included Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman. Seeing numerous action scenes was also very entertaining and the graphics were considerably good for the time when the movie was produced.

The war was fought as a result of slavery, but still many northerners still looked down on blacks with contempt, as seen when the 54th regiment interacts with another white regiment. Even though they were fighting for the same cause, on the same side of the war, the white soldiers didn't want blacks to fight in their war. it is sad that these men had to sacrifice their very lives just to be seen as men. this film shows that even though the 54th regiment were treated unjustly and not taken seriously, they still fought as bravely and did their best to help preserve their country's unity.",Glory

The war scenes also well represent the violence and pain that soldiers went through in order to fight for their rights. The characters also have a way of connecting with the audience in a way that makes the message that the director is trying to send extremely effective.

I ended up thoroughly enjoying the movie, wanting to watch it all over again.Edward Zwick, I feel, does a very good job in portraying the life that the men of the 54th Regiment lived in. The controversy that revolved around these men and the way that they overcame it is incredibly showed. Watching the movie, I feel as though I could understand in some cases the depth of pain and emotion the men felt.Overall, 'Glory' is truly moving, allowing viewers to have a good understanding of what exactly black soldiers faced during the Civil War and the path they traveled on to secure the freedom for all.Though there are the occasional mishaps in the movie, the majority of the film has a touching and mainly accurate portrayal of the time that these men served in the Union.'Glory' is definitely a film not to be missed, no matter what your preference is.",Glory
356,michaelpothaczkcc,Best Civil War Movie,9,1 January 2017,"Not many military/war movies are well at messing with your emotions and thoughts. Many war movies shove explosions and battles in your face in every scene. When some one dies it does not seem like a big deal. But in the film Glory they did a great job in making you feel connected and feeling that you are apart of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. The movie gives you several main characters with in the Regiment which help you feel like every soldier is very important. Characters like Sgt. Maj John Rawlins Pvt. Trip and Cpl. Thomas Searles give you 3 different views on what a black soldier thought during the war. One view of being a free black man to two different views on what it means to be a black soldier with Rawlins and Trip. The movie also demonstrates the racism with in the Union and it's soldiers. Many thought that a full black Regiment was a joke, that they all were going to be ""animals"". Even on character called them ""Chimps"". The north was not entirely on their side this showed that the country still required progress even in the north. The only complaint I have about the movie is the execution of the battle scenes. In the last battle at fort Wagner when a soldier got hit by an explosion and flew up it looked delayed and kinda fake. The movie was not about the battle scenes it was about displaying the bravery and dedication of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment and that they should be remembered as an essential part of reforming the future of the United States for equality for all.",Glory

It was very hard to see all the death and how the African-American soldiers were treated during those times; so I would not recommend for younger audiences.

It showed their battle for equality, Not equality in the modern sense but equality as In their fight to be allowed to even fight In battle, Because they were black they faced racism on their own side before they fought the confederates. A good example of this shown in the movie was when a quartermaster withheld shoes from colonel Shaw (Matthew Broderick).Another example of this was when the white soldiers who were marching into battle didn't get along with the soldiers of the 54th who were doing manual labor on the side of the road. When the 54th was finally allowed to fight they did so bravely. Their crowning moment was their attack on fort Wagner, which unfortunately did not fall due to their attack and it was In this battle that Colonel Shaw was killed, Also many other members of the fifty fourth were killed. I like the fact that the movie shows a historical accuracy by burying Shaw with his men, This was meant as a sign of disrespect but was not taken as such by Shaw's family when they received the news.I did not however like the goriness in the movie, although accurate especially when Shaw was in that medical room and another soldier was screaming at the doctor who was amputating his leg.

Glory goes beyond this stereotype and instead focuses on the characters. You really get to see what the attitude was towards African Americans during the war. You also get to see how this attitude changes for the whites working with them. At the beginning of the movie, Matthew Broderick does an excellent job of showing how Shaw's attitude matches those of everyone else; that blacks are below whites and should be treated as such. But as he gets to know the men and continues to work with them, he realizes that blacks are people too and he begins to fight for them to be treated as such.

I think it does a great job of showing how African Americans were treated during their fight for equality. The film shows graphic scenes of Africans being abused, both physically, with whips, and verbally, at first with white commanders, and then with higher generals. There was even a scene that showed whip scars from slavery on a man that was to be punished.

366,connorw-99919,Great Civil War Movie,10,2 January 2017,"Glory was an excellent civil war movie that perfectly portrayed the journey of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry and their leader Col. Robert Gould Shaw. It was more than just an ordinary war movie about gunfire and blood, it was a fight against racial prejudices and a fight to prove that blacks are just as capable to serve their country as whites are. The producers did a good job in minimizing the fighting and gore, as the movie was about more than just the war, it was about showing the glory and courage of 54th Massachusetts Regiment. The actors picked for the starring roles, Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, and Morgan Freeman, all did an excellent job in playing their parts and working together. I especially liked the way Washington played his character as feisty and non-compliant while slowly changing throughout the movie and becoming a real leader by the end. There were many moments in the movie that showed the real courage and fight of the soldiers such as when no one backed down after learning about the Confederacy's Proclamation to kill anyone involved in a black infantry and the willingness of Shaw and his infantry to lead the battle at Fort Wagner, knowing they were certain for heavy casualties. It was quite tragic in the end to see that many of the soldiers and leaders had perished in the Battle of Fort Wagner especially since the Union forces didn't prevail there. But it was truly amazing to see how some of the white leaders such as Shaw had transformed and dropped their racial prejudices and literally gave their lives to a black regiment during these times, and the movie Glory portrayed that perfectly. It was also great when the producers added the writing at the end saying that even though the 54th regiment didn't win the battle it resulted in the authorization of many more black troops because of their courage in the battle and so Lincoln credited them with turning the tide of the war. There were a few historical inaccuracies that brought the movie down a tiny bit, such as the fact that the regiment was made up of mainly illiterate runaway slaves, when in reality they were actually educated free blacks. However, this was just to add to the effect and meaning and did not really harm the amazing movie.",Glory
367,andrewth-12152,"Glory stays entertaining, and accurately portrays events of the Civil War.",10,2 January 2017,"This was a very entertaining movie. While normally in my experience I am not enthralled by historical reenactments, Glory was enrapturing from start to finish. While not all of the movie was full on action, it often portrayed a different struggle; that of the African American soldiers, not against the confederates, but against their unfair treatment by the Union. From lower wages to not being allowed to fight, these struggles were more the focus of the movie than the actual violence. However, there was plenty of both, which kept the movie interesting. Unfortunately, half the characters one would be fond of are killed off in the end. However, sad as this may be, it is accurate to the civil war, and helps reinforce the tragic events of the time period.",Glory
368,martinezaustin,An Extraordinary Story,10,2 January 2017,"Glory is an incredible story in every way. Told through the upbringing of the 54th regiment of the Union Army, the story enriches the viewer by giving them a first-hand look at how the first wholly African American regiment came to be. With powerful dialogue and provoking scenes, Glory shows how the comradery was built between the white men and the black men of the regiment. There were certainly speed bumps along the way, however. This upcoming was no straight and easy path. For example, Colonel James Montgomery does not make it easy for the men to maintain their dignity when they burn down an entire innocent and defenseless town. The character development in the movie is just lovely. Thomas, the son of a freedman and a freedman himself, learns that he isn't above anyone and must learn and fight just like the rest of the regiment. Silas Trip, a rather mischievous man, learns to strap down and be a good soldier. In the end, Trip takes charge when Colonel Shaw falls. This story shows how men were able to overcome their differences and fight for a common cause. This movie warmed my heart and I would recommend it to anyone as a 10/10.",Glory

Leading actors: Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington, each portray their diverse characters in such a way, that the events shown become easier to understand. Often times, the remarkable acts of the colored infantries in the civil war, are left less noted. However, the film showcases this monumental step in the creation of equality for all US citizens. The bravery and determination of the men, along with the tenacity of their leader, Col. Robert Gould Shaw(Matthew Broderick),is made prominent. Despite the fact that the film was created in 1989, the overall quality is ahead of its time. Scenes are emotional, powerful, and action-packed. All in all, Glory is a must see if you are looking to expand your knowledge on events of the Civil War, or if you are just looking for an impactful story.",Glory
372,candybarsonmars,Great movie. A lot of action,8,3 January 2017,I thought the movie portrayed the civil war perfectly. It showed how the African American soldiers fought for their place in the military and society. They proved themselves worthy of fighting. Overall the movie was action packed has intense scenes that made the movie goer question morality and gave them a look into what the civil war was actually like. MAtthew broderick's character was probably the best. His morality and conscience was questioned and tested through the perilous fighting and barbaric actions that took place in the civil war. Although the movie is now dated it still holds purpose in the world of movies because of its significance of showing what the war that divided this country was really like.,Glory
373,katelynt-23006,This movie moved me and was only somewhat boring.,7,3 January 2017,"Glory is definitely a wonderful movie telling the story of a Union military regiment made entirely of black soldiers led by a white colonel. This movie shows how men can progressively form a brotherhood and a strong bond that transcends race. This is a powerful message for anyone willing to sit down for an interesting and thought provoking 2 hours. The character development is amazing and excellently exemplifies the quarrels between white men and black men even in what was supposed to be a progressive action. My only bone to pick with this movie was some of its historical inaccuracy. The Pay Crisis, a big problem during this time, was given one small scene where not much was really even said about the problem. It was instead used to show how Shaw was standing by his men and wanted them to know they were all in this together, which is still a powerful message. It just got me that the problem was belittled to such a small mention. Another small discrepancy in this movie is that it leads one to believe that the 54th regiment fell at the Battle at Fort Wagner. This is untrue as the remaining troops went on to serve for the remainder of the Civil War. Overall, this movie has such powerful themes and really offers insight into how progressive this era was.",Glory
374,michaeldifloriocc,The movie is about the 54th Massachusetts which was one of the first African- American regiments during the American Civil War.,9,4 January 2017,"Glory was great film and one of my personal favorite Civil War movies. The movie is very entertaining and addresses a chapter in the war that is too often skipped over by the history books. The struggle of African- American soldiers to prove themselves equal to their white counterparts as well as gain freedom for those still trapped in slavery is not addressed often enough. There are minor a few historical inaccuracies throughout the movie, but these can be forgiven as the general theme of the movie rings true. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of history or anyone who is just looking for a good exciting movie to watch.",Glory

If this movie were to be shown in a classroom, there are little accuracies to judge from. But on the other hand, on a personal level (the acting and in general just the idea of the movie) was fantastic. Matthew Broderick is a great actor, along with Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. I would recommend this movie for any war junky that just likes battles and the atmosphere of war, but if you are really anal about how movies are accurate, I would probably stay away from this one. All in all, this movie makes you feel as though you are actually there fighting with the men, and is a very intense movie. Greatly directed and greatly produced is what I have to say!",Glory
378,crspaulding,Causes you to realise what the Civil War was really like.,7,30 December 2017,"It was very moving to see how people thought through their decisions and how their decisions changed based on who was expecting an answer/action. Like with Robert Shaw, you could see his mind working and how sometimes he was stuck between wanting to do the right thing and wanting to do what everyone else was expecting. It really showed the divide between the races and how sometimes even though a white man would want to help and side with the blacks, they would say or do what other people would do, even if it hurt the people they were sided with. Also this movie was very sad. I understand it's a war and people die in war, but I cried over these characters, which I guess is what the directors were going for. This movie caused me to feel how the people felt back then when they got news that people died.Also the music totally gave away that it was going to be sad, but that didn't make it any easier to deal with, and the music honestly probably made it worse emotionally.",Glory
379,mollydoles-47927,Great embodiment of the Civil War,9,26 December 2017,"When I was looking for a Civil War movie for my history assignment, I came across ""Glory"". At first, I thought that the film was just going to be another boring old war movie where the directors try and make the film inviting and realistic. But for me this wasn't the case at all. From the very first opening scene, with all of the gunshots and explosions, I honestly felt like I was standing on the battlefield with all of those soldiers. It just seemed so realistic. The actors who portrayed the individuals during this time and place, just made the film so much more memorable. When most people think about the Civil War, they don't usually think about a bunch of African Americans training and practicing to fight in the war, I'm glad how the film changed just that. I also enjoyed how the film also expressed the other issues of the time like slavery, sacrifice and freedom. As I kept on watching the film, I found myself not only getting drawn into it more, but experiencing every aspect of the war. I also found myself getting attached to a lot of the characters in strange ways, because they all have something so interesting and different about them. Even as the film draws to a close with the Battle at Fort Wagner, you feel like your actually there, its so astonishing. ""Glory"" is what every war movie strives to be.",Glory

385,trevorcaluscc,Reveals a Deeper Truth,9,1 January 2018,"Upon watching, I noticed that this movie portrays the 54th as made up mostly of runaway slaves like Private Trip (Denzel Washington) or John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman). However, it was in fact comprised of many freedmen like Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher) not just from Massachusetts, but New York and Pennsylvania as well. This to me actually reveals the deeper truth about black soldiers in the Civil War, and the attitude towards blacks in general at the time. Southerners believed that blacks were naturally servile, and even Northern abolitionists questioned their manly spirit. By portraying the 54th as runaway slaves, Glory was able to illustrate the fact that blacks were not natural slaves, but men who were in many cases even more willing to fight and die for their freedom than white soldiers. A very solid point that couldn't have been made without poetic license on the director's part, even if that meant stretching history a bit.",Glory

387,johnbills-49107,Glory is gruesome but historical.,8,2 January 2018,The movie Glory which was directed by Edward Zwick was a very bloody movie that told of the first all African American regiment. At first they believed they would get a lot of fighting in the war but come to the realization that they are going to have to earn the fight and to earn getting placed in battle. They fight for the Union. The regiment is led by Robert Shaw and it is a very tricky task for him as he believes in the men but there is the theme of prejudice in the mix. The men finally are given the task of leading a bloody attack on Fort Wagner for the final fight of the movie the assault failed and Shaw was killed. The movie painted a very good picture of what actually happened on the attack of Fort Wagner and the 54th regiment. It was very gruesome but also very historical.,Glory

The cast is amazing and every character has you feeling all kinds of emotions. Washington's development through this movie had me almost in tears at times.

389,jzkatniss,Amazing experience,9,3 January 2018,"Glory was an absolutely amazing movie to watch. I was blown away at how historically accurate many of the scenes were and how it matched up with what I learned in my US history class. (For example, the refusal of the men to accept a lower pay than white soldiers.) It was definitely an emotional and moving movie to watch. The way that the battles and other events were filmed, plus the added phenomenal music choices truly makes one feel for what is happening on screen. I had the ability to sympathize with men of the 54th Regiment, as well as Colonel Shaw, who was trying to overcome his own personal battles while fighting for what was the best for his own men. What really blew me away was at the final battle scene at Fort Wagner, which showed just how much the men of the 54th were devoted to the Union, their comrades, and their leader; and were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in honor of their country, even though they weren't even treated equally to their white counterparts. The most moving part was how Colonel Shaw made the ultimate sacrifice, and ended up being laid to rest along the men whom he gave everything for.",Glory
390,rockbandcp,Factual portrayal,9,3 January 2018,"This movie was very accurate in the way that the 54th Regiment was established during the Civil War. The soul and heart of each individual helps portray the idea of how life was like in this regiment especially for blacks. As the 54th Regiment was the first all black regiment in the North to be established in the Union, blacks weren't exactly treated correctly like normal men. But Shaw was able to get the trust of his men to be able to push them to war. This was greatly portrayed in the movie as Shaw, went to many commanding officers to get what his solider needed for battle or to get into battle. The death of Shaw, was recorded in history to have had three shots in the chest, and the 'funeral' of Shaw being thrown next to his fallen soldiers.Now ignoring all of the facts, this was quite enjoyable and should be used for confusion/understanding of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment.",Glory

This was a very different view of Broderick for me as I am used to seeing him in much less intense movies such as Deck the Halls, but it just shows his brilliance as an actor.A very interesting part of the Civil war, the 54th Massachusetts Regiment being the first African-American regiment, which isn't too well known being the focus makes for a very appealing movie.",Glory

The men of the 54th regiment have dealt with slavery, sacrifice and the fight for freedom and respect. It is exciting to watch the growth of the characters throughout the movie. Two examples of characters that showed significant growth are Shaw and Trip. Robert Shaw begins as a captain in the Battle of Antietam who has trouble handling the outcomes of war. By the end, Shaw has advanced to colonel of the 54th massachusetts infantry who is willing to do anything for his men both in and out of battle. Trip starts off as a bitter runaway slave, who through the help of Robert, Rawlins and others, later learns to open up to his fellow soldiers and be a true leader for all.

I found it neat how this movie was done on a black regiment. It was good that they got to partake in the war when they wanted to.
