0,TheLittleSongbird,Outstanding on all levels!,10,18 November 2009,"The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Iron Giant
1,SnoopyStyle,Great family movie,8,30 March 2014,A giant metal man falls from space and lands in the woods of Maine. Hogarth Hughes is a little boy living in a 1950s small town. He finds the giant who has lost its memory after its head gets dented. His single waitress mother refuses to believe his tall tale. Government agent Kent Mansley has arrived to investigate. Scrap metal artist Dean McCoppin is enlisted to help to feed the giant with scrap metal.Brad Bird has created a great family movie. It is touching story with a great message. It deals with very tricky subject matters and does it with tremendous skills. And it's a giant robot with a little boy. That's the dream of every little boy.,The Iron Giant
2,Hitchcoc,Much More Than a Cartoon,8,7 February 2000,"Sometimes when watching an animated feature, I spend my time saying, ""What great animation."" When this happens, I wonder if I am doing what the producers wanted me to do. Like so many things, should I be so enamored with the technical part of the movie that I am distracted from the content. As I watched ""The Iron Giant"" I realized I had forgotten it was an animated feature. Don't get me wrong. I knew the enormous title character was animated, but the relationships among the characters and the intelligence of the script caused me to forget that these weren't actors. The movie is filled with tender moments, especially as they relate to our feelings of our own mortality. What I enjoyed is that the grownups aren't treated as garden variety bad guys. Even the military, which is nearly always portrayed as evil, finds itself in a contradictory position--having to go on faith. The animation is wonderful, but so are the ""performances."" No spoilers here, but I think the ending is a lovely tribute to the spirit of the life force in all of us--even those of us not made of metal. See this. It is one of the better movies of the year.",The Iron Giant
3,classicsoncall,"""You came from the sky, right?""",7,25 April 2018,"With the story's setting in 1957, my best takeaway from the film was the nostalgia associated with the era's fascination with the threat of an atomic attack and it's attendant duck n' cover drills and underground shelters. The movie itself had the feel of one of those 1950's Warner Brothers cartoons and one of the principal characters, Dean the scrap metal guy, was even called a beatnik at one point. The kid Hogarth (I agree with Kent Mansley, who names their kid Hogarth?) enjoys Superman and sci-fi comic books and there's even a Maypo TV commercial thrown in for good measure. Yessiree, those were the good old days.What's not so 1950-ish though is the representation of a family with no male figurehead, that's a decidedly modern day construct that probably began some time during the Eighties and continues today with all sorts of dysfunctional families. There's also the ever present anti-gun sentiment presented throughout, both subliminal and overt. I was kind of enjoying the picture until the liberal propaganda took on a get in-your-face message the way it did. Not to mention the portrayal of the FBI guy as a villain, though I'm sure there are some agents who would be as gung-ho as Mansley. But chloroforming the kid was taking it a step too far.So with the competing forces at work here, I thought the picture just minimally passes the fun quotient. The Iron Giant itself had almost a creepy kind of ambience compared to most of the cutesy kind of characters you generally have in these animated features. At least he rises to the occasion to save the day for the citizens of Rockwell, that was a plus. But every time the Iron Giant ate something made of metal, and I know it's only a cartoon, I had to wonder - how does that work?",The Iron Giant
4,gavin6942,Fun 1950s Alien Robot,6,23 February 2015,"A boy makes friends with an innocent alien giant robot that a paranoid government agent wants to destroy.At first, I wasn't really sold on this film because I thought the animation style was a little bit cheesy. I was reminded of Don Bluth and such films as ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"". Not that Bluth made bad films, but by 1999 we were expecting a lot more from our animators.Anyway, my concerns on animation were overshadowed by a genuinely good film with some fun characters. Not a great film, but one that light-heartedly looks at the 1950s and 1960s Cold War era. This is a satire on a child's level. In some ways, it has a similar feel as Joe Dante's ""Matinee"" (1993) and could make a good double feature.",The Iron Giant
5,lee_eisenberg,The Who and outer space enter Stephen King's possible childhood,7,4 October 2017,"Yesterday was the 60th anniversary of Sputnik's launch, so it was probably appropriate that I watched ""The Iron Giant"", which indirectly deals with Sputnik. The movie has a plot similar to ""E.T."", with a lonely boy befriending a being from outer space. In this case, the setting is 1957 Maine (so could this accidentally represent Stephen King's childhood?) and the being is a giant robot whose origin and purpose never get revealed. Sure enough, a government agent starts prying.I was surprised to learn that the executive producer is none other than Pete Townshend of The Who. The last person whom you'd expect to be involved in the production of a movie that pokes fun at 1950s movies about aliens (the movie also has a scene where the kids are in school watching one of those duck-and-cover movies). The whole issue of a possible nuclear war looms large in the background (and nowadays, it looks more possible than ever).When the movie got released, the ads made it look like something to avoid at all costs. It turns out that the movie isn't half bad, despite the occasional crude humor. Not any sort of masterpiece, but still OK.The cast includes Jennifer Aniston, Vin Diesel, Harry Connick Jr. and Cloris Leachman.",The Iron Giant
6,jboothmillard,The Iron Giant,9,9 September 2005,"For a cult cartoon, this is a really good representation and kind of re-imagination of Ted Hughes's popular book about The Iron Man, or Iron Giant. Hogarth Hughes is a young boy living just outside the town of Rockwell with his Mother Annie (Friends' Jennifer Aniston). One day he discovers something extraordinary, a giant man made of iron (The Fast and the Furious's Vin Diesel) that only eats metal. Hogarth and this giant become really good friends, they also befriend scrapyard owner Dean McCoppin (singer Harry Connick, Jr.). Unfortunately, United States Government Agent Kent Mansley (Flubber and Thelma & Louise's Christopher McDonald) suspects Hogarth of looking after a monster, and the army soon gets involved. It won BAFTA the Children's Award for Best Feature Film. It was number 59 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!",The Iron Giant
7,Tweekums,An animated delight,9,28 January 2013,"Set in 1957 when the Cold War was at its height and the Soviets shortly after the Soviets had put Sputnik into orbit people are understandably somewhat paranoid. When a giant robot falls from the sky the only witness is believed to be imagining things at first but young Hogarth Hughes believes him and goes out to investigate; he finds the huge robot devouring the metal at an electricity substation. While he is watching the robot is electrocuted and but he saves it by turning off the power. The robot appears friendly and starts to follow him home; unfortunately he causes a train crash and soon afterwards Government Agent Kent Mansley arrives and sets about searching for the robot; his only clue leads him to the Hughes household where he soon suspects Hogarth knows far more than he is letting on. Hogarth manages to hide the giant in the local scrap yard, which is run by Dean McCoppin; a friendly beatnik who uses the scrap to make his 'art'. Eventually it emerges that while the robot is friendly it has formidable defensive capabilities that could make it extremely dangerous if attacked... which is just what happens when Mansley gets the army in.This film is a real delight; it has a slightly retro look and nicely captures the Cold War paranoia and childhood innocence. The animation looked great; the characters didn't look 'cartoony' and the scenery looked great. The story is a solid sci-fi drama that, while aimed at children, can be enjoyed by older viewers. The voice actors, who include some big names, do a fine job bringing the characters to life. The story itself had plenty of exciting moments as well as a few laughs. There are also a few poignant moments that deal with death and may cause a tear or two to be shed... and not just by younger viewers! Overall I'd say this is a fine film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",The Iron Giant
8,BA_Harrison,The Iron Giant stomps all over the competition.,10,2 February 2008,"Based on the poem 'The Iron Man' by Ted Hughes, Brad Bird's first feature length movie, The Iron Giant, tells the story of a huge alien robot who crashes to Earth, where he is befriended by a young boy named Hogarth, but also pursued by a paranoid US government agent.Hogarth proceeds to teach his newfound metal pal about the wonders of life, the tragedy of death, the difference between good and evil, the joys of dive-bombing into water, and the all important moral 'we are who we choose to be'. However, when the boy innocently aims his toy gun at the massive mechanoid, the robot's true purpose is revealed: he is a walking array of extraterrestrial fire-power programmed to respond to aggression. And with the army on its way to apprehend the giant, it looks like the proverbial is about to hit the fan.Will the robot destroy his enemy with a series of high powered energy blasts from his in-built armoury? Or will he choose to fight his basic programming and become a hero?Featuring breath-taking CGI-enhanced animation, flawless direction, and a script that brilliantly and intelligently mixes comedy, action and drama in equal doses, The Iron Giant is an unmissable treat for all ages.In true kids' movie tradition, the story has several important messages to tell and a couple of tear-jerker scenes, but it thankfully never resorts to the heavy-handed moralising and saccharine sweet schmaltz of many an animated feature. Instead, Bird delicately handles his themes of anti-violence, freedom of choice, life and death, and sacrifice for those you love. And he does this without once feeling the need for a song and dance number. Nice one, Brad!The film also succeeds in feeling very 'real', despite its fantastical premise. This is undoubtedly down to the well developed and likable characters (brilliantly voiced by a talented cast) and the incredible attention to detail in the animation, which not only includes loads of authentic 50s design, but also throws in some great references to the sci-fi movies and comics of the time.If the majority of animated features of the past few years have left you less than impressed, do yourself a favour and track down The Iron Giant. Charming, exciting, and ultimately uplifting, it's a film that'll leave you grinning from ear to ear.",The Iron Giant
9,dbdumonteil,A treat for the whole family,8,5 February 2005,"What ""le roi et l'oiseau"" (Jacques Prévert and Paul Grimault,1977) did against tyranny,""the iron giant did it against wars.OKay ,the ending of the movie does not promise us the end of all wars on earth as in Ted Hughes ' book ,but the scenarists found excellent equivalents.They did not betray Hughes's spirit whose purpose was first pacifist:what's the use of building huge weapons when a dragon coming from outer space makes them useless?So you will find no monster in the movie:it's pure human evil;it's a human hand which pushes the button that will kill and destroy.The part of Hogarth in the book is relatively minor.Hence the necessity to develop his character and to give him a personality.He's got only his mother (whereas in the book he had a whole family)and he's called Hughes of course.Hogarth is a wonderful little boy and he makes with the giant a team that will appeal to everybody.We also meet the scrap's owner and Kent who was made from start to finish by the scenarist with talent:a true villain,a coward,a deceitful man,all his scenes with Hogarth are great!Elements which happened at the very beginning of the story are deftly used in the film :the reconstruction of the robot for which the seagulls play a prominent part .The pictures are often remarkable ,with nods to old sci-fi movies of the fifties .Hogarth in the hands of the giant recalls the young bird which the robot takes in ""le roi et l'oiseau"".I will tell the children:if you 've seen the movie,read the book!if you've read the book,watch the movie!",The Iron Giant
10,Quinoa1984,Sweet tale of friendship,9,15 July 2000,"This movie shows the story of a boy in 1957 (surrounded by sci-fi movies and paranoia) who finds and be-friends a gigantic iron man who is very likeabe and will remind some of E.T., except in animation.  Very nice film with some comedy on the side to help out.  One of the best kids films to come around in the past years, helped out by being animated and not with live action and computer graphics (not to mention cheaper).  A",The Iron Giant
11,hitchcockthelegend,You are who you choose to be.,9,18 July 2009,"It's the 1950s and young Hogarth Hughes happens upon a visitor from space ..... in the form of a giant iron man.Delightful animation adaptation of Ted Hughes' much beloved 1968 novel ""The Iron Man"". Set during the period of time when Cold War and sci-fi paranoia was prevalent, The Iron Giant embraces these themes and stokes them with lessons of friendship, hatred, death and pertinent reminders of pacifism. Directed by Brad Bird and scripted by Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Though the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude that ran through many of the 50s sci-fi schlockers was one of being ""because we don't understand it, lets destroy it"" is something that Ted Hughes and the film makers here capture perfectly. Sophisticated and intelligent in its approach and delivery, this is definitely one of the better animated film's from the modern age. 9/10Voice work comes from Jennifer Anniston, Harry Connick Jr, Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Christopher McDonald, M. Emmet Walsh and Eli Marienthal.",The Iron Giant
12,Scarecrow-88,The Iron Giant,10,2 December 2016,"Before The Incredibles and MI: Ghost Protocol, Brad Bird directed this delightful animated feature for Warner Bros about a kid who bonds with a giant robot he finds in the woods outside of his home town. The giant robot seems to be from outer space, feeds on metal, and will not shoot unless provoked or defending itself. And the robot seems to have artificial intelligence that allows it to evolve, learn, and feel. Insidious government agent (voiced by Christopher MacDonald; who better, right?) sets his sights on the robot and wants the military to obliterate it, convincing military general (John Mahoney of Frasier fame) to assist in firing upon it, which puts the boy, Hogard (voiced by Eli Marienthal), in jeopardy. Hogard's harried, single mother is voiced by Jennifer Aniston and the Iron Giant is beautifully voiced by Vin Diesel. Harry Connick, Jr. voices junk metal artist, Dean, who also bonds with Hogard and provides refuge for the Iron Giant at his junkyard. The Iron Giant is a feast for the eyes of fans of comic book robots from the old school. Terrific animation in a very Ray Bradbury-esque small town, including some damn strong storytelling revolving around a boy and a robot that find a friendship full of wonder and awe, caught the attention of critics; this was just a sample of Bird's gifts. The disembodied robot hand following Hogard around in his house while MacDonald's Kent Mansley finds him suspicious and tries to snoop on his activities is a knockout! Best scene could be when Hogard first meets the giant as he rips into power lines and metal structures for nourishment. Also dazzling is a scene involving train tracks as Hogard pleads with the giant to repair it as a locomotive approaches. The way Bird lights the Iron Giant as distantly sinister only to convince us of how harmless he looks and acts when up close speaks about how we should wait before assuming something is dangerous until the evidence presents itself. The ending which has various body parts trying to find themselves in a return to a whole and the Iron Giant sacrificing itself for Hogard makes the heart sing. A special treat. Just wonderful. Cloris Leachman, James Gammon, and M. Emmet Walsh also contribute voices to members of the town.",The Iron Giant
13,Doylenf,Succeeds brilliantly as entertainment...fine animation...,6,14 November 2006,"There was a preoccupation with paranoia about invasion from aliens that permeated all the science fiction in the '50s. This story builds on that fear by giving us an E.T. sort of encounter with an alien, in this case a super-sized piece of metal called THE IRON GIANT, who is saved from extinction by a little boy who pulls the ""Off"" switch when it appears the Giant is about to be electrocuted.It's stunning right from the opening scenes, animated with fresh originality and voiced by some expert actors (HARRY CONNICK, JR., VAN DIESEL, CLORIS LEACHMAN and the little boy voiced by ELI MARIENTHAL).Not only is the story engrossing, but there's a humanization of ""the creature from outer space"" that defies description. The animators manage to make his thought process apparent with minimal dialog and you can really feel for his emotions when he is asked to perform a noble act (at the climax) in order to save mankind from a fate worse than death.There's an effective background score by Michael Kamen, without the songs that seem to irritate some devotees of animated films, and it moves briskly at a pleasing pace that should keep young and old riveted to the sometimes magical events.Briskly entertaining and well worth watching--among the best of the animated films based on pure fantasy. The very expert voice-overs make the characters seem amazingly real.",The Iron Giant
14,LeonLouisRicci,Fantasized Realism & Heartfelt Charm Elevate 1950's Homage,8,29 June 2016,"It's an Odd Animated Film that Failed to Capture Box-Office Gold in 1999, but has since Gained a Huge Following. Charming in its Simplistic Storyline and for that matter it's Animation, the Movie is Familiar with its Boy and His Pet Adventure and its 1950's Sci-Fi, Real-World, Cold-War Paranoia. Newspaper Headlines, Television, Comic-Books, and a Fatherless Child (Dad died in the War), all lend a Sense of Giddy Verisimilitude to the Proceedings. By Today's Standards the Animation can Look a Bit Sketchy at times but it never Loses its Appeal and Cranks Up when it Needs in the Action Sequences. The Script is not Dumbed Down and Respects the Kids Ability to Understand what's Going On, and the Humor is Sharp without being Gross or Slapstick. As a Bonus there isn't one Sappy Song to Distract. Overall, it's Not a Great Animated Movie but it sure has a Classic Feel and Holds Up just Fine.",The Iron Giant
15,grantss,"Predictable and dull, but kids will like it",5,17 November 2017,"1957, the Russians have just launched Sputnik and Cold War fear and paranoia is the order of the day. Hogarth Hughes lives with his mom, Annie, in the small town of Rockwell, Maine. One day a very large robot lands on earth from outer space. After some adventures, Hogarth befriends the robot. However, the US government has sent a special agent to investigate the strange occurrences in the area (unbeknownst to them, caused by the robot) and his intentions towards what's causing the phenomena are less benevolent.Predictable and dull. Quite conventional, linear story with an overused, unoriginal story line. Replace the robot with any other harmless creature that a kid might befriend but the authorities will be suspicious of and you have the plot for heaps of children's movies. Doesn't add anything new or profound and is only mildly entertaining.Kids should like it though. Is essentially a made-for-kids movie and they won't be disappointed.",The Iron Giant
16,Boba_Fett1138,Heartwarming and with a wonderful atmosphere.,9,20 March 2005,"""The Iron Giant"" really is a wonderful movie. It's a different kind of animated movie and although it has some comical moments the main essence of the movie are on the emotions and atmosphere. It can be describes as ""E.T."" with an Iron giant.The movie really perfectly captures the 50's atmosphere. The animations are not really among the best of the last couple of years but they look more than good enough.The story is heartwarming and the ending really is superb!Jennifer Aniston is really good and very believable as a mother but Harry Connick Jr. really was the one who stole the show.

17,view_and_review,Giant Heart,9,24 December 2020,"I just recently watched ""Bicentennial Man"" and I was in no mood for a romantic robot story. I figured with an animation with a name like ""Iron Giant"" I was safe from such a tale, but was this going to be any good?The iron giant crash landed somewhere off the coast of Maine. He was seen by the town drunk and then by a little boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal). Hogarth fearfully befriended the robot that liked to snack on all things metal. Actively seeking this extraterrestrial giant was a government man named Kent (Christopher McDonald). It was evident that if Kent found the big bot he was not going to treat him nicely. Hogarth, to his credit, intuitively knew to keep the giant hidden for his own sake.Eventually, Kent found the metal mammoth and brought the army down on it with its full weight. I guess I should've mentioned that the year was 1957, Russia just launched the Sputnik, we were deeply entrenched in the Cold War, and fallout drills were a regular thing. So, a 10-story mobile machine could quickly and easily be interpreted as a WMD to bring America to her knees. Therefore, even though Kent was overly eager to destroy the iron giant, it didn't take much urging for the Army to feel likewise.Is it OK to say I was moved by this movie? It wasn't just the friendship between Hogarth and the alien because I'd seen that in ""E.T."" The fact that this alien creature sacrificed himself to save a small town was heart-rending. He was such a stark contrast to the selfish, cowardly, and duplicitous Kent that his sacrifice was made that much more heroic and reverential. The iron giant had giant heart.",The Iron Giant

19,Wizard-8,YES!!!!! NO SONG OR DANCE NUMBERS!!!!!!,10,6 August 1999,"What a GREAT movie! Not just for kids, but adults as well. Kids will love it on one level, and adults will love it on another level. Even adults who are not parents will love it!There's humor, there's action, there's nostalgia, there's the perfect capture of being a child, there are positive messages (be yourself, don't kill, etc.), there's satire, there are adults who are not stupid and not comic relief....there's GREAT WRITING!AND NO SONG AND DANCE NUMBERS! Also, there are NO COMIC-RELIEF ANIMAL SIDEKICKS! Take that, Disney! I know some people might be resisting this movie, because it looks like it's aimed for kids - and they might be expecting a Disney clone (and we all know the bad results of Disney wannabes).....but TRUST ME. Give this movie a chance - you'll love it!Is there ANYTHING wrong with it? Well, the only thing that bugged me (just a little) were some close-ups of the characters - these certain close-ups had a ""sketchy"" look a la the movies ""We're Back!"" and ""Balto"".Fortunately, there's very little of this.

20,anaconda-40658,The Iron Heart.,7,19 August 2015,"The Iron Giant (1999): Dir: Brad Bird / Voices: Harry Connick Jr., Jennifer Aniston, Christopher McDonald, Vin Diesel, Eli Marienthal: Delightful animation for children with a title that seems to symbolize the junk yard owned by one character who creates art out of it. In this case the supernatural character has a heart. Premise is one of those boy meets robot themes where a giant robot falls to earth and is befriended by a boy but a government agent wishes to destroy it. To prevent that from happening the boy seeks help from a junk yard owner named Dean. The giant feeds on metal so the location would be perfect for hiding. Flourishing and heart warming with directing by Brad Bird. Voice talents include Harry Connick Jr. as the voice of Dean who finds art within the ugly. We know where he ends up but the character is unique in his point of view. Unfortunately Jennifer Aniston as the boy's mother who is too busy for her son, is never interesting. Christopher McDonald as the agent villain bypasses formula with hilarious pratfalls. Vin Diesel voices the gentle Iron Giant himself who goes through predictable friendship elements before a great climatic sacrifice that ends with a wink. Finally Eli Marienthal voices the curious boy who accepts and befriends this robotic companion. Strong theme regarding friendship and heroism that should be great lessons for the target audience.

21,HotToastyRag,Great cartoon for children,7,12 June 2017,"A little boy makes friends with a robot, insisting he's gentle even when the government suggests he's armed and dangerous. Although it doesn't sound like a normal premise for a children's cartoon, The Iron Giant is actually really delightful for kids and parents alike.Cartoons nowadays are sometimes just flashy and noisy, and absolutely torturous for parents to watch. And you'll be hard pressed to find one that actually teaches kids good lessons! The Iron Giant teaches good things. I won't spoil any plot points, but trust me, the lessons are ones you'll want your kids to learn. The last portion of the movie does have some violence, but compared to the loud, flashy scenes of today's movies, it's nothing your kids haven't seen before. And the animation is regular 2-D style, which I believe is better for kids' brains and developing attention spans anyway. When I watch a cartoon, I like it to look drawn by a person, not by a computer.If you particularly want your children to be shielded from on screen violence, you can wait until your kids are a little older. Otherwise, it's a really great movie to watch with your sons and daughters!",The Iron Giant
22,zetes,A Lesson that Ought to be Learned by American Animators,8,31 May 2000,"Don't get me wrong, I did really enjoy this film, but it is also a good example of why I think American animation is far inferior to Japanese animation. And I am talking solely about the animation (i.e., character design, movement, and scenery), not the story complexity. There is no doubt that the stories of Japanese animated films are more complex than those of American animated films. The Iron Giant's story is basically taken straight from E.T.Anyhow, watch how mannered the designs of the characters' faces are in this film. Check out how large Hogarth's ears are. And check out how exaggerated the characters' movements are. This becomes staggeringly unrealistic very quickly. It begins to look, well, just plain goofy. People don't really look like this. They don't make these sorts of expressions.People always complain about the eye size of Japanese anime characters. Their eyes are big for a simple reason which was stated in ancient Rome by the neo-Platonist philosopher Plotinus: the eyes are the windows of the soul. The sculptors of the later Roman Empire always made the eyes on statues enormous, just like the Japanese animators do. Most human expression comes from the eyes, so Japanese animators made the eyes on their characters bigger.What most critics of the Japanese anime eye-size have failed to notice is how large the American animators have made the eyes on their characters. The Americans are obviously learning something from the Japanese. Disney animators have said that there is not a work day that goes by where they do not watch parts of films by Hayao Miyazaki. These films have influenced them greatly. But what American animators have missed in the Japanese animation is that the other pieces of their characters' faces are extremely downplayed. Their mouths, ears, and nose are all very small. Humans express much less in these areas of their faces than the characters of American animated films. This over-exaggeration has occurred in all Disney movies after The Little Mermaid, The Iron Giant, The Road to El Dorado, and I can even see that this is a problem in the upcoming animated flick Titan A.E. It is a big problem, and it must be solved.As for the film itself, after I got around those technicalities, I was quite touched. I liked the anti-violence theme a lot. I think it is a very good film for children. I give it an 8/10.",The Iron Giant
23,Mr-Fusion,Its heart is giant,9,31 August 2015,"Would it be immature to say that ""the Iron Giant"" is Vin Diesel's best movie? Either work? Either way, he did help bring the Giant to life and was integral in the bond between a boy and his robot. The character's got personality and he was key. And not just Diesel, it's pretty much the whole cast. It's got an appealing animation style (fantastic use of CGI) and just the right assortment of memorable characters.The themes here are timeless - fate, freewill, having a soul - and the emotional wallop this movie packs is fearsome (the Giant's final word is guaranteed to bring the eyes to mist, and I mean that). and in the hands of a lesser director, this would come off as calculated schmaltz. But the reality is far from it. This is heartwarming of pharmaceutical grade.One of the best family films I've ever seen.9/10",The Iron Giant
24,llltdesq,One of the best animated films of the last fifty years,10,15 December 2015,"This combination hand-drawn/computer animation film was the directorial debut of Brad Bird. There will be spoilers ahead: This is an extraordinary mix of two different animation techniques and it manages this amazingly well. Based on an excellent novel by Ted Hughes, though it was critically acclaimed (deservedly so) it performed poorly in its initial run at the theaters, probably because the marketing left much to be desired. It's managed to find its audience through home video and word of mouth and it now gets the appreciation it deserves.I'll just to a basic synopsis of the plot and discuss the technical aspects a bit. Set in 1957, just after Sputnik's launch, a huge robot crashes just off the coast of Maine. It comes ashore and eventually meets a young boy named Hogarth. After a series of misadventures and the robot's near destruction and recovery, Hogarth starts teaching the robot various things through reading him comic books. The robot is impressed with Superman.Needless to say, the crash of the robot and his actions draw the attention of the authorities, represented by a smarmy jackass working as an FBI agent and an Army general. Hogarth tries to hide the robot, which, given its size, is no easy task. He gets the help of a proto-hippie/beatnik/sculptor who runs the junkyard (this comes in handy, because the robot eats metal).The FBI and the military become aware of the robot eventually and through a series of misunderstandings and outright lies, the military moves to destroy the robot, even to the point of setting up a nuclear strike from a sub. The jackass government agent sets in motion certain destruction of the town, only to have the robot perform an heroic act to save everyone. The ending of the film is perfect.The technical aspects of the film are great, from a top-notch script through great voice work, magnificent animation, a perfect score for the film and the timing is excellent. The film won a good many animation awards and was lauded by critics at the time. It's a fantastic film.This film is available on DVD and was released on Blu-Ray this year (2015) in a ""Signature Edition"", which I have yet to see. Regardless, this film is most highly recommended.",The Iron Giant
25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Gentle giant.,7,12 April 2021,"'The Iron Giant (1999)' focuses on the friendship between a young boy and a giant machine after the latter crash-lands near the former's small town. Arriving from an unknown place at a time filled with post-war fear means that most people immediately fear the giant, even though he's as friendly as can be thanks to a bump on the noggin and a heavy dose of electricity. It isn't just his initial trauma that keeps him kind, though; it's the teachings of our protagonist, who firmly instils a sense of self in the being and tells him that killing is wrong. The first half of the flick is basically about the blossoming relationship between its two leads, which is charming and well-paced. The second introduces some resonant themes - regarding choice, discrimination and, even, what it means to have a soul - and brings its antagonist, a selfish and nationalistic government agent, further to the forefront. This all builds to an effective finale that successfully pushes the movie's message of tolerance and the ability to choose who you are. Its final emotional punch really is as impactful as its reputation would have you believe. In general, the film doesn't seem as though it panders to kids at all; it tells a relatively grown-up story that should appeal to all members of the family. It's a beautifully animated adventure with a giant heart at its core. 7/10.",The Iron Giant
26,g-bodyl,Fantastic Film!,9,6 December 2014,"The Iron Giant is an underrated animation film and is just plain excellent, more so than it ever has a right to be. On paper, it's practically an animated version of E.T, but the film works despite the non-original story. It is full of substance and style with an underlying political commentary that will appeal to the adults. The kids will love the gorgeous animation (very good for a 1999 film) and the story about an unlikely friendship. I haven't seen this in many, many years until recently, but it was always one of my childhood standouts.Brad Bird's earliest theatrical film is about a kid named Hogarth befriends a giant robot from another world, during the height of the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik. Hogarth tries to protect the giant-sized robot not only from his mother, but also from a bunch of bureaucrats believing the giant is actually a spy for the Soviet Union.The voice acting is not that bad. The robot does not speak English at first, but when he does, it was voiced by Vin Diesel who made the robot seem even more lifelike. We also have some solid voice acting from the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., and Eli Marienthal.Overall, The Iron Giant is one of those rare gems that appeal to both adults and children. The story is executed well enough against the backdrop of political and historical issues and the film is also a visual spectacle with the animation way beyond its time. Who cannot resist a film among the veins of ET, especially one that is good as this. It's a beautiful, must-see film. I rate this film 9/10.",The Iron Giant
27,ericstevenson,It lived up to my expectations,9,26 January 2017,"I had heard many great things about this movie over the years like how it was one of the best non-Disney animated movies ever made. Actually, creator Brad Bird did in fact go on to work for Disney (or more specifically Pixar), but it's still a Warner Bros. movie. It's great to have this little gem around and I'm so glad that it seems to be getting more popular all the time. Originally, it was thought to be obscure, but now it's praised for being the great film that it is. I admit that there are some things that could have been done better. We never do find out where the Iron Giant came from.I guess the implication is that he was from another planet. Was he supposed to be used as a weapon by aliens invading Earth? If so, that means things are going to get a lot worse now. I do believe it's said he's from a planet already destroyed or something. What I love about this film is the pacing. Nothing feels rushed. It's hard to do that with a movie less than 90 minutes long. It's a little clichéd at times, but it's still a great movie. The plot is fairly simple. It's about a robot that crash lands on Earth and befriends a little boy. I guess it's like ET only with a giant robot.The best part of this movie is easily at the end. It's when the Giant sacrifices himself to stop a missile from blowing up a town. I certainly felt chills when I saw that. I was thinking it would end when the military showed up, but I still got the big climax at the end. We even get a setup for a sequel, more or less as we actually see the Giant having his parts come back together at the very end. I guess it's all open to interpretation what happens next. By the way, the idea of his body parts coming back together is freaking amazing. We get characters that act like real people. I also love the 1950's setting. It's as good as people make it out to be. ***1/2",The Iron Giant
28,cricketbat,Plays on every boy's dream: to be friends with a giant robot,7,6 August 2018,The Iron Giant is a fun little movie. I can see why Pixar asked Brad Bird to direct their animated feature.

31,CuriosityKilledShawn,Brilliant movie,10,20 August 2000,"But it should have been longer. I distinctly remember an entirely different ending in the book. I also do not remember any 1950's communist paranoia in the book or the character of Hogarth being so young. But the changes do not harm the movie and the ending this film has is just fine. There are obviously no opening credits to the film so guessing the voices is cool fun. But it's impossible to guess who plays the Iron Giant.But the Iron Giant himself is a wonderful hero. It's cool to watch him learn simple things and having him eat cars is a neat little characteristic. I like when he's bored and he plays with the hood with one of the cars in the junkyard. You cannot dislike the Iron Giant.I think it was a wise and creative decision to make this cartoon in 2.35:1. Most cartoons by Disney are in 1.85:1 or even worsein 1.66:1. Warner did a great job with this movie. These days it seems that Dreamworks SKG and Disney seem to do all the feature length animations. But Warner beat them all in 1999 with this movie.My only gripe is that it should have been longer. At 87 minutes, it's all over too quick. But it's still cool.",The Iron Giant
32,ironhorse_iv,"This animation movie deserves a giant applause! It was a great film, with hardly any sign of rust!",8,25 July 2017,"It's sad, that this animated movie was not a huge hit, when it came out in 1999, due to poor-marketing. Nevertheless, as time, with on, 'The Iron Giant' has grown widespread critical acclaim from both critics and audiences for its out of this world story about an friendship between, a 50-feet alien robot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) & a young boy, Hogarth Hughes (Voiced by Eli Mariethal) in a rural part of Maine; while, an over paranoid government agent, Kent Mansley (Voiced by Christopher McDonald) tries to hunt them, down, fearing that the giant could be dangerous. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while some of the plot-points does sound a little too familiar, as if it's ripping off, 1982's 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' in the first half. I have to say, the story in the second half, is still unique enough to stand out on its own. The movie has a lot of strong themes that films like 'E.T' doesn't deal with, such as an anti-nuclear war message. I like how the Giant has to deal with his inner conflict as a doomsday weapon; similar to how humans have to deal with the destructiveness nature of themselves, during the Cold War. Somber scenes like when, Iron Giant & Hogarth greets the deer, really does show, the good of humanity, and how, losing our humanity, makes us, into cold-blooded machine, like the hunters, later in that moment. However, it's not, all gloom and doom, as there is also an equally satire funny side to the film's anti-war message, with Agent Mansley, acting upon violence, without thinking or getting to know, the other side. It gave us, some of the best moments like the mitt phone call to general, Shannon Rogard (Voiced by John Mahoney) or landside ice cream scenes. Also, the child-like, interaction, between Hogarth & the Iron Giant was equally as fun to watch. The diving scene, alone, makes this film, worth seeing. Regardless, of the tone of the film, the movie really does capture the era, full of panic, fear and anxiety as leading politicians and the media whipped the public into an escalating mass frenzy, over Nuclear War with the Soviets, in both satirical and serious ways. It's a film, both children and adults would love. Yet, there is some things, that people might not, like, about this film, such in the case that the story of the movie bears very little resemblance to author, Ted Hughes's novel, 'the Iron Man', in which, it loosely based on. Not only is the settling change from United Kingdom, to United States, but the film also, cut, most of the fantasy parts, such as the battle with the Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon. Another thing, that the film cut, was the fact that the giant robot was a harmony of the spheres whom keeps the cosmos in balance, by singing in the ocean. Because of this change from siren to alien robot, the original producer, guitarist Pete Townshend, from the rock band, 'The Who', instead, chose to release a rock opera adaptation, 'The Iron Man: A Musical', in 1989. Regardless, of the changes, the movie still has amazing soundtrack by composer, Michael Kamen. Great use of collection of Bernard Hermann cues from 50's and 60's sci-fi films. Not only that, but wonderful voice acting from everybody in this film, ranging with Jennifer Aniston as the mom, Annie to supporting voice actors like Harry Connick Jr. as dead-on, beatnik, Dean McCoppin. Another great thing, about this movie is the animation. I love how director/animator, Brad Bird and his crew, blend the CGI Giant with hand-drawn Norman Rockwell, mixed with 1950s illustration so well. Everything looks and feels the era. It really does mesh. Even the pacing for 'the Iron Giant' was, well-done. However, I don't think, the signature edition is the best version of the movie. The once delete scenes of Annie & Dean, talking in the diner, doesn't really add much, as we see them, interact, later in the film. Another thing, I don't like, about this version is the dream sequence. It really ruins, the mystique of the Giant, by revealing, too early that he is a doomsday weapon. I really don't like, how jarring, it is. I would, rather have the fight in the junkyard, instead. It's a little stronger, as it has weight, due to Giant, nearly killing the person, he love, due to his programming. It makes the climactic, tear-jerking ending, a little more powerful. Don't get me wrong, I still think the Signature Edition is a good version to have, if you're a mega fan, but if you haven't seen the movie, just watch the original theatrical cut of the movie. Overall: I like how this film is picking up in popularity, due to the film's director, going on to direct, other animation hits like Disney's 2004's 'The Incredibles' & 2007's 'Ratatouille'. While, it's still not a household name. I think, with each new generation. Both children and adults will come to love, this film for its creativity, comedy and heart. It's highly recommended.

33,slightlymad22,A Delightful Surprise,8,31 October 2014,"A box office bomb upon release (Due to dire marketing for Warner Bros who simply didn't know what they had) ""The Iron Giant"" is a great animated story, at 36 years old I sat and watched it on my own, when it was on TV and I was very entertained. Plot In A Paragraph: A Robot from another planet is stranded on Earth somewhere in America, he befriends a nine year old boy, who helps keep him from the US government who are searching for him.Straight off, I need to note the similarities with this and Steven Spielbergs ""E.T"" re read my 'Plot In A Paragraph' replace the word robot with Extra Terrestrial and you have the 'Plot In A Paragraph' for ""E.T"". It's not a bad thing, ""E.T"" is a classic and I love it, and is not exactly the same, but the ending did reduce me to tears like ""E.T"".All the voice actors are good, stand outs are Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes, Jennifer Aniston as Hogarths mother, Christopher McDonald is superb as U.S. Government agent Kent Mansley Harry Connick, Jr. as Dean McCoppin and Vin Diesel as the title character.

Jokes, but I surely did this movie did have an emotional vibrational effect on me.Besides its tiny appearance in Ready Player 1 I'm not sure if it's a good thing a sequel/remake/tv show has not been made. I say this because current movies/tv shows in the last 15 years have been mostly hash.

35,briancham1994,Great,8,6 August 2020,I loved this film when I was younger. It is probably one of the influences that led me to become a science fiction fan.

36,tomgillespie2002,Charming and incredibly powerful fantasy,9,25 June 2018,"The roaring success of Disney's The Lion King (no pun intended) in 1994 inspired something of an animation boom, during which various production studios attempted to cash in on the trend to varying degrees of success. Warner Bros. Feature Animation had a moderate hit with Space Jam, but underperformed with the likes of Cats Don't Dance and Quest for Camelot. They had one bona fide hit with The Iron Giant, a truly wonderful little feature adapted from Ted Hughes' 1968 novel The Iron Man. It didn't leave much of a dent at the box-office, but found a loyal audience on home video. In the 19 years since its release, The Iron Giant is fondly remembered as one of best animated features of the 1990s, and saw director Brad Bird poached by a little up-and-coming studio called Pixar.In the fictional town of Rockwell, Maine in 1957, the residents are busy gazing up at the sky in fear of the Soviet Union's satellite Sputnik spying on them, and school children are shown Duck and Cover style educational films to prepare for a nuclear attack. In the surrounding forest, a huge object crashes down to Earth, alarming local fisherman Earl (M. Emmet Walsh). 9 year-old Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) spends his nights watching cheesy sci-fi movies and dreaming of owning his own pet. His mother Annie (Jennifer Aniston) thinks they cause too much mess, a point that seems to be proven when young Hogarth accidentally releases a squirrel into the local diner. With his mother working late one night, Hogarth wanders into the woods and comes across the object Earl insists he saw: a giant alien robot (voiced by Vin Diesel) that enjoys munching everything from train tracks to the local power station.This kind of allegorical coming-of-age tale has been done before (think E.T. but with an adorable weapon of mass destruction), but rarely with such charm and genuine emotion. It's influence can be felt in everything from the recent Pete's Dragon remake and A Monster Calls, and it's no surprise that the film continues to attract new fans. The Iron Giant questions what would happen if a gun could feel. The titular giant occasionally turns aggressive in the face of possible danger, as the alien's true purpose becomes increasingly and unnervingly clear. But with no memory of his mission, it's down to Hogarth to teach metal hulk kindness, and the youngster does so in a way that only an innocent could. A moment in the woods sees the unlikely friends come across the corpse of a deer. At first, the giant cannot comprehend death as he can regenerate, but Hogarth manages to teach him about the finality of death. It's incredibly powerful, and it's message is even more relevant today than it was almost 20 years ago. We all have choices in life, and sometimes simple human kindness and empathy can be infinitely more powerful than brute force.",The Iron Giant

The direction which was made by Brad Bird was very good and he presented very well how friendship would be no matter the differences of each other. He also presented what people can do if they are united and support each other. I highly recommend everyone to watch this animation movie for all the previous reasons but also because I am sure that you are going to love it.",The Iron Giant
38,johnnyboyz,Really impressive and vastly superior to a lot of other animated films.,8,18 January 2009,"I liked The Iron Giant, I liked it a lot. The film, surely, has to be recognised as one of the last, great two dimensional animated films that the Americans made at the back end of an era. If we formally acknowledge that the new 'era' of animation is, or was, from 1999 onwards predominantly three dimensional from an American perspective, then this is the last great film of that time. Here is an animated film that does not rely on purely the visual, even if they are as impressive as they need to be and opts for story telling and emotional involvement more than anything else. Sprinkle on a little bit of Cold War paranoia and you have The Iron Giant, a period set character study of a human being and a creature not of this world.The film is one of which it is difficult to not just sit there, and stare in both wonder but more importantly appreciation at what's being presented to you. While both colourful and atmospheric, I was most impressed with director Brad Bird's attention to character detail when it came to the animation. It's the little things; the way in which the Iron Giant himself moves around in the manner in which he does. The Iron Giant is big and hulking but its presence is juxtaposed with the very fragile and delicate relationship he has with a young boy, who is established to be pretty desperate for a friend or companion early on. The Giant's presence and traits are comparable to the only villainous character of the piece, an F.B.I. agent who's grossly smaller than The Giant but seems more threatening despite the height difference and jolts about in an urgent and jittery manner giving off an entirely different feeling to that of the large, lumbering but friendly robot.Bird's work here reminded me of Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit series, a series which I feel has since partly been inspired by The Iron Giant. There is that knowing feeling behind the production; that setting in the past and that referencing to what the filmmaker enjoys or grew up enjoying, indeed The Iron Giant's tag-line is 'It came from outer space!', maybe a nod to Hollywood science fiction films of the 1950s and 60s that dealt with the fear of impending Communist-related invasions. The link is uncanny  a giant robot the most antagonistic character of the film, believed to be Russian, sent to 'the good ol' U.S.A.' in order to destroy the nation from within.The hero of the title is a nine year old boy named Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal) and lives with his mother Annie (Aniston) and in a desperate attempt to prolong some sort of relationship with another being other than his mother, he brings home little animals not exactly fit for household domestication. The establishment introduces this fact and acts as a good introduction to post-modern artist, working in a time not ready for the post-modern, Dean McCoppin (Connick Jr.) who's a friend and ally for them later on. After some other initial events, a large robot voiced by Vin Diesel, who merely has to supply some grunts and other such noises that eventually turn into synthesised words, comes into contact with Hogarth and they strike up a friendship following a train-wreck.Enter F.B.I. agent Kent Mansley, played by Christopher McDonald in the sort of slimy role you'd associate with him, in all his paranoid glory. I think initially, we don't really mind if Mansley gets his prize. He makes some enquiries and asks about but he's just doing his job. We know about as much about it as he does and it hasn't really earned its place in our hearts but it's not until Bird brilliantly brings together both the Giant's friendship with the boy and Kent's gradual obsession with the capturing of the robot until we veer more into a thought process that demands we don't want to see him get his man.Echoing what Bird sets up at the beginning, The Giant acts as a fatherly figure for Hogarth; wearing a constant smile on his face and vastly becoming one of the friendliest non-human components to a relationship involving children we've seen on screen. From the Cold War era sci-fi films of the 1950s onwards to Spielberg's E.T. and Cameron's second Terminator film, the referencing and inspirations flow and flow. Additionally, the other feelings I got amidst all this harked way back to comedy of the silent era and the use of heartfelt music and shots of character's reactions while humorous exchanges were played out  it seems Bird's knowledge and love of cinema-past knows no end.Despite this phenomenon of a giant robot landing on Earth and a child taking a likening to it, the film looks at the identity of the robot more than it does anyone else. As a grey and hulking thing, is possesses neither the colour to place it into any particular category nor the necessary intelligence to place it within another. What reminded me of the second Terminator film apart from the obvious fatherly connotations was the scene in which the boy teaches it the difference between good and evil, and the poor kid uses all the facilities available to him, which peak at mere comic books, to give this creature some sort of identity and how he can be 'good' like Superman instead of 'bad' like the typical 'destroy the world' aliens  perhaps a reference to more recent blockbusters like Independence Day which rely on flashy visuals, hostile aliens and zero logic. The Iron Giant is the opposite of this and is vastly superior. Towards the end, there is one lump in the throat moment and I don't think the immediate ending does the film a disservice. The Iron Giant is truly a special animation for children and adults alike.",The Iron Giant
39,Rectangular_businessman,A new classic,10,11 February 2007,"""The Iron Giant"" is simply one of the best animated movies ever made. Brad Bird, the talented man that worked in shows like ""The Simpsons"" and directed the great animated film ""The Incredibles"" is the man responsible for this masterpiece. That man is a genius who is able to turn the simplest stories into gold, having an entire career of very good films. Even his ""Mission Impossible"" film (A franchise which I particularly don't like)managed to be worth-watching.Now ""The Iron Giant"" is one of my favorite films, and it is the best movie directed by Brad Bird, having not only a great animation style, but also a memorable story (Which shows that kid's films could have deep and complex stories)and many intesting characters, The Giant itself is a fascinating creature, which could be easily considered one of the most endearing figures from the entire animation history.Movies like this are enough proof that making a ""children's film"" is not a excuse for a lack of quality. It is for movies like this that I'm a fan of animation.",The Iron Giant
40,TheMovieDiorama,The Iron Giant is not as cold as the title would lead you to believe.,9,8 April 2018,"I remember watching this when it first came out on DVD, I was about 6 years old. To a child, this is a story about a colossal robot wanting to use his powers for good. Nearly twenty years later as I enter adulthood, I view this film completely differently. A story about loneliness, a young boy confiding in the titular character in a bid to teach him his ideologies of anti-warfare. A governmental agency concerned for the welfare and security of their own country, viewing the giant as a weapon from another nation. I cannot emphasise enough how rare it is to find such a multi-dimensional family animation that tells a different story dependent on your own perspective. Bird's directorial debut is a statement and certainly a landmark in the animation genre, garnering a cult status where the giant is often the centre of several pop cultural references ('Ready Player One' anyone?). The steampunk aesthetic appeal, CGI on top of hand-drawn animation and surprisingly dark themes has resulted in a flick that has aged impeccably well. Incredibly minimalistic in its storytelling, particularly the deer death scene, yet utterly powerful. The characters themselves were brimming with personality, from the mischievous boy to his worrying mother, they all brought the pictures to life accompanied by an intelligent screenplay. Voice acting was pretty special also, boasting an A-List cast including Aniston and the deep sounds of Diesel. The pacing was pretty much perfect, quickest hour and a half you'll experience. Let's talk about that heartbreaking ending...perfection. It took everything that the film symbolised and placed them all into one powerful scene. Everything from the themes, metaphors and ideologies. Boom. That scene. It defines the film. Whilst I would've preferred they removed the final minute, it is a family film so I'll let it slide. What I can confidently say is that The Iron Giant is a timeless thematic classic that hasn't shown any signs of rust just yet. One of the most impressive directorial debuts.",The Iron Giant
41,Anonymous_Maxine,A startlingly good animated film that seemed to come out of nowhere. Amazingly well done.,9,14 September 2000,"The Iron Giant is an animated film that probably did not get the attention that it deserves because it was not made by Disney. When I saw this movie, I did not know anything about it and I didn't expect much from it, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The story involves a young boy who discovers a crash landed (?) robotic giant in the woods near his home, where he lives with his single mother. Despite the predictable ending and the rather unoriginal story (""Cool, my own Terminator!""), The Iron Giant is a heartwarming tale of friendship and family that provides excellent entertainment for all ages. It is unlikely that the giant is able to learn so much about humans (emotions, soul, acceptance, life, etc), but that's beside the point. I mean, they never even hinted as to where the giant came from, who made him, or why he was endowed with such jaw-dropping artillery. Is he some sort of alien Bicentennial Man? Even though the giant's entire background is left a mystery, the film is still able to tell a wonderful story. Let's just hope they make a sequel in which the giant's home is portrayed more.The cast was also excellent. In particular I enjoyed Harry Connick Jr.'s performance as the endlessly tolerant Dean McCoppin, and most of all, ironically enough, Christopher McDonald as the government agent Kent Mansley. Christopher McDonald almost always plays a jerk of some sort in all of his movies (Happy Gilmore, Dirty Work, and SLC Punk, to name a few), and he was endlessly amusing in The Iron Giant (""...no, Bob, big things happen in big places. And the sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them.""). Great stuff.The Iron Giant is a movie for all tastes. I strongly believe that anyone who didn't like this movie did not give it a fair enough chance, because it was just so well done. It is one of those rare films (especially animated) that has an ending that virtually forces you to smile. You can't walk away from this movie unhappy, it is touching, it's fascinating, it's entertaining, and it should not be missed.",The Iron Giant
42,Vartiainen,Amazing old time adventure,8,27 June 2017,"In his directorial debut, Brad Bird ends up delivering a heartwarming adventure film easily on par with the best Disney has ever produced. Not surprisingly he joined Pixar right after this. The Iron Giant is a deceptively simple tale of a boy and his giant space robot friend, but once again it's the execution that's more important than the idea itself.Because this film has layers. For one thing, it's a pure and honest love letter to mid-century nostalgia. Think Steven Spielberg on steroids. Everything from the visuals to the character archetypes evoke that era, and it does so beautifully. Honestly one of my favourite pulp films ever made. Even though technically this takes place in the Cold War period, and thus isn't really a pulp film, but it has the same aesthetic and feel. If you can watch a movie and immediately think of Indiana Jones, then it's a pulp film, at least a little bit.For another, the characters are amazing. From Hogarth and his child-like wisdom and believe in the concept of rightness to the shady government agent Kent Mansley, who's one of those villains you love to hate, but who you also kind of get in some weird manner. Not to even mention the Giant itself, who's simply great. It's like you gave a bloodthirsty grizzly the soul of a puppy and then made him look adorable and badass at the same time. And the fact that he is entirely CGI yet blended in with the rest of the animation so well that I didn't even notice, is mind-blowing.Pretty much the only thing that I can gripe about is the story. Or rather the fact that this is one of those rare films where the complaint is that it is too short. There seems to be a scene or two missing between the second and the third act, rhythm-wise, but that is explained by the fact that Bird and his team operated on a minuscule budget and under strict time restraints.And frankly, if your only complaint about a movie is that it is too short, then you know you've watched something pretty special. The Iron Giant failed at the box office upon its release because it was barely marketed at all, but luckily more and more people have found it over the years. Do yourself a favour and give it a watch.",The Iron Giant

44,GOWBTW,Great for all dreamers!,10,14 February 2008,"This is one modern-day fantasy movie that is great fro all times. ""The Iron Giant"" is a touching fantasy movie that will stick in our minds for times to come. Set back in the 1950's, there a young boy named Hogarth(Voiced by Eli Marienthal) who lived with his single mother. His favorite playground is a junkyard. Then one day, he meets an alien robot known as The Iron Giant(Vin Diesel) who is stranded on Earth. He becomes friends with the metallic being and he has a ball. Especially when he gets in an old Cadillac and it's spun around like he's in a merry-go-round. Since he was his only friend, he had to protect the robot from paranoid government agents. When one of them thinks the Earth is under attack, it was up to Hogarth and his mother and boyfriend to stop the Military for making the biggest mistake of their lives. Well, the Iron Giant does his duty by stopping the missile from destroying the Earth. That's true heroism. I enjoyed this movie. Like E.T., only metallic! 5 stars!",The Iron Giant
45,jamesrupert2014,"Sentimental, predictable but entertaining E.T.-mecha hybrid",7,20 May 2020,"Back when Sputnik ! was still orbiting, young Hogarth Hughes (v. Eli Marienthal) tries to hide a giant, extra-terrestrial mechanical man that he has befriended, first from a smarmy government agent (v. Christopher McDonald), and then from the U.S. Army. The whole story is pretty trite and features most of the typical sentimental tropes supporting a simple pacifist message (which is a bit undermined when it is established that the Giant only resorts to force when immediately threatened, a response that many people might consider appropriate). The animation and the voices are fine and the titular mecha is a pretty good example of diesel-punk design. Fun film for the kids with a young hero frequently putting one over on the grown-ups, numerous amusing or exciting images, some minor poop-humour, and a satisfying, up-beat ending.",The Iron Giant
46,ebiros2,Brings tears to my eyes,9,21 December 2005,"This is perhaps the best animated movie I've ever seen. Iron Giant is a no name robot who's origin and purpose for creation is unknown, but is surprisingly innocent and powerful. It has a sense of purpose and has loyalty and decency we don't even see in ourselves until it is provoked and shows what it might have been created for - weapon of mass destruction. Who created the Iron Giant with its heart of gold and body as indestructible weaponry ? Was it part of an unknown robot army from another planet that got strayed from its squadron ? The story leaves lots of plot holes that beckons us to know more about this character. Would the writer of this story do a sequel that fills in all the gap in the robot's back ground, and help us look deeper into its character ? It seems to be one of the best character to come along in many years. Although the scope and the period setting is similar to ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" this animated character is much more lively, and thought provoking.",The Iron Giant
47,runamokprods,It's a shame this enchanting animated film never found a bigger audience,9,11 March 2012,"While the story is familiar (kid meets alien/ monster/ outsider, and befriends them, understanding they're not the threat the grown up world thinks), Brad Bird brings humor, freshness and heart to the sub-genre that lets this transcend into a terrific movie. Set in a cold-war paranoid America of 1957, the titular creature cash lands from outer- space, with a knock on his giant metal head leaving him with amnesia about his purpose or history. After being saved by a 9 year old boy, a series of at first comic, then later more serious adventures begin. There's some very funny jabs at the cold war mentality, and some terrific, unusual supporting characters, including a mom more interesting and complex than you find in most cartoons, and a local wanna-be beatnik artist who joins in to take the giant iron man's cause. I love the look they designed for the Iron Giant himself, there's something wonderfully retro and almost art deco about him, and they do a great job of bringing heart and emotion to this gigantic metal creature. By the end I was shocked at how moved I found myself. A lovely, well told, fun fairy tale that is as much for adults as for kids.",The Iron Giant
48,yusufpiskin,Timeless Cult Masterpiece,10,31 December 2020,"This was one of my favorite films growing up and it holds up extremely well. Apparently, this bombed during its initial release, as it was caught between the old ways of animated films and the new breath of fresh air in Pixar. Brad Bird will become well known for the latter's stellar films, but his directorial debut may be his crowning achievement.Set during the height of the Cold War in the '50s, the story follows a young boy named Hogarth, who lives with his single mother in a small town in Maine. He's obsessed with science fiction movies and comic books and finds a paternal relationship and friendship with an otherworldly giant robot. The film balances its obvious E.T. inspired storyline with its Superman-esque inspiration as well. It's seeped with 50's iconography and mood too, giving the audience a lot of insight into the Cold War and the red scare that was so prevalent at the time the movie was taking place. Its period piece offers much more subtext than a traditionally animated film.Every character is charming and well rounded, whether it be Hogarth himself, Annie, Kent Mansley, Dean, or the Iron Giant himself. All the voice actors do extremely well too, especially Vin Diesel in the titular role, whose soft-spoken giant's relationship with Hogarth is the emotional backbone for the film. The animation and art style is beautiful, and adds to the depth of each character with exaggerated facial expressions, and offers a lot more focus on the emotions of the characters. The computer animation of the iron giant gives it an otherworldly perspective.The Iron Giant is one of the best-animated films of all time, and a classic that can be enjoyed by anyone. It's an emotionally warm film full of vibrant animation, great characters, and a story that offers much heart and joy.",The Iron Giant

50,noralee,Terrific Animated Take on 1950's Sci Fi,8,12 December 2005,"Unlike most folks I know I really like Pete Townsend's ""Iron Giant"" album. It inspired me to get the Ted Hughes' book and read it to my kids, who really liked it. The animation in the movie is terrific (except for the faces, which are distractingly bland, especially the kid). There was clearly a dig at Disney by opening with an ocean storm as most Disney animation starts with that (i.e. ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Tarzan,"" etc.) or maybe animators just like doing storms. This is done very much like ""Day the Earth Stood Still,"" a throw-back to old '50's sci fi films with a dash of ""The X Files,"" including a satire of Fox Mulder's character. There's references kids won't get, like the ""Duck and Cover"" cartoons, Sputnik and general Cold War paranoia, which I remember quite well.Nice that there's actually some sympathetic adults in this, especially the sculptor/junk yard dealer where the Giant hangs out.But I did miss Townsend's music, even if they bought him off with a producer credit.(originally written 8/22/1999)",The Iron Giant

52,ferbs54,I Should've Listened To My Nephew...,8,6 December 2007,"Back in 1999, when ""The Iron Giant"" was first released, several friends of mine, aware of my love for 1950s sci-fi films, urged me to go see this movie. For some reason, I passed. A few years later, another friend's 4-year-old son told me what a great video this was, but I still declined to watch it. And even later, when my own nephew (then 6) told me what a hilarious scene he'd just witnessed in ""The Iron Giant"" (the one in which young Hogarth drinks espresso and starts talking a mile a minute)...well, even then, I still ignored the advice. Anyway, all the above folk will be happy to hear that I finally DID watch this animated sci-fi film last night, and found it absolutely charming. Featuring wonderful animation, nice touches of warmth and humor, and wry commentary on '50s paranoia and A-bomb lunacy, the film really does have appeal to young and old. Lovers of sci-fi and/or action films should especially enjoy the film's latter scenes, in which the lovable Giant gets ticked off and morphs into an unstoppable killing machine. My hat is certainly off to everyone involved in the making of this most entertaining film. And this ""special edition"" DVD, filled with more extras than you can imagine, certainly does live up to the advertising. Hmmm...maybe I SHOULD take my nephew's advice and finally rent out his favorite movie, ""Toy Story 2""...",The Iron Giant
53,Spleen,"Well-meaning, partial success",7,24 April 2002,"We all like happy endings, but this one is an insult.  It's so obviously a blight on an otherwise fine story that we can't even take pleasure in it. Why is it there?I said it's a fine STORY; as far as the telling of it goes, something is lacking.  I'm not sure animation was the right medium for it.  It's fashionable to decry Disney's reliance on such things as fairytales, fantasy, anthropomorphic animals and musical numbers - but these, after all, are the kind of thing that can indisputably be done WELL with animation, and there's nothing wrong, surely, with making sure that form matches content. But animated science fiction like ""The Iron Giant"" never quite works.  (No, not even when it's done by the Japanese.)The giant itself is a masterpiece: the precise angles of every spring and hydraulic chamber have been calculated by a computer, then outlined so as to match the hand-drawn characters ... indeed, I get the feeling that the giant could not have been portrayed any other way, which, I'm afraid, means that the film was doomed, since when the humans are drawn and animated and characterised so as to match him, they don't have any life.It's a noble, honest attempt (apart from the ending), pleasing to look at and certainly worth seeing.  The extravagant praise heaped upon the film at the time of its release is probably due to the fact that it HAD just been released, and people hadn't had time to forget it.  Surprisingly little time is required.",The Iron Giant
54,onepotato2,Much to admire,7,19 March 2008,"This is a movie especially for boys. As a kid, it's just fine to have friends your own age, but younger kids know that hanging out with cooler, older teens is what you really want. The last thing my teen brother wanted was a kid pestering him. But I did have an older cousin who hung around with me one summer. That was a great summer. Here Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr) is the human friend that hangs out with adolescent Hogarth, much as Connick did in Little Man Tate. Already that's a fine idea for a movie. As in other Brad Bird movies, the value of friendship is the whole show here. I'm completely open to that message. But bigger than any big brother, is the 100 foot tall Robot. Before there was Michael Bay's Transformers, there was this giant, retro, CGI robot. The giant is a simple soul who is perfectly sweet until hidden wires are tripped. The giant doesn't even learn why he does it, much as in human personalities. To say any more would be to crush this movies slight story.When I first saw this, I liked a lot of it but had some minor qualms about the ending. I really wish there was a moratorium on bombs launched in the final ten minutes of a movie (for the next 20 years). Fresh endings would then have to be devised. I really wanted this imaginative movie to also be as clever in it's major conflict and resolution as it had been everywhere else. I still like it, but it seems like the middle is lacking stronger scenes. As it turns out, scenes were cut from the film. I thought I'd never say this about a film, but it really craves a one minute montage showing some silly moments where the robot-Hogarth friendship intensifies.The smooth-moving CGI robot is inserted into more typical animation. Animators know that any object without a hard outline is difficult to animate conventionally, and so they take advantage of the CGI to make the giant's eyes two big hazy, expressive floodlights. All the voice talent provides good work, which results in the closest I've seen to acting in an animated movie. But even the largely silent giant has very nicely-observed behavior that contributes to his character. Disney's much more conventional attempts to get 2-D characters to act have been downright awful and d.o.a. (Hunchback, Pochahontas). The ""be whoever you want to be"" message here, while a cliché, is such a soft-sell that a single word (""Superman..."") at a pivotal moment, may make your eyes well up. It's really nice to see an animated movie that hasn't been overcapitalized and upsold like Disney's cynical 90-minute product launches; and one without their self-inflated need for instant classics; an urge that neuters any decision that might result in a unique or creative moment. This movie also spares audiences the obnoxious post-Genie hyperactivity and movie-ruining--freneticism that has made other Disney movies after Aladdin obnoxious and desperate (Hercules, Tarzan). I'm not a big fan of Bird's Disney work, though Monsters Inc (friendship again!) was very nice.I'm glad I re-rented this.",The Iron Giant
55,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,The Iron Giant (1999),8,5 February 2012,"I watched this for the first time in 13 years just now. Saw it at the cinema originally, and it was truly a sight to behold. It still holds up today and the animation looks incredibly fresh. The Iron Giant sees a large robot land on Earth in the 50's. A young boy soon makes friends with it, while a government agent investigates the sightings. The robot has forgotten who he is, but trouble arises when his built in defence mechanisms may be a danger to the small town. The Iron Giant is base on the book The Iron Man written by Ted Hughes. A book I remember from primary school. This adaptation has Americanized it, as well as making it more of a space themed Sci-Fi. The book had a battle with a space dragon, something I would have actually liked to see, even if it didn't work. The 50's setting is perfect for this kind of film. It's all about friendship, and being able to make choices no matter how we were raised. The giant is both sympathetic and cute, as well as being dangerous. It's the age old case of violence begets violence. I did find certain moments rushed in the film, as animation is usually short, but most of all I had trouble associating with Kent Mansley. He just goes too haywire towards the end. This is great stuff though, with strong animation, good vocal performances, exciting action sequences, and messages about friendship, peace, and sacrifice.",The Iron Giant

Hogarth is a young boy that makes friends with an iron giant who seem to be a danger to the country. USA's army tries everything to stop the giant, since they believe it's a threat to them. But, Hogarth being his friend and knowing it's not a danger at all, tries to hide the ""monster"" from the government agent-- which eventually fails. In the beginning I couldn't believe this picture would have such emotional ending, so it's a great surprise for me. The theme this film used has been done many times in movie history, but it is still a worth while and entertaining version. Those who only think about war, killing and protect from the ""enemies"" should give it a chance and maybe change their minds-- especially army people who become paranoid once they get into the corporation.",The Iron Giant
58,PredragReviews,Hungry Man of Iron,8,22 February 2017,"One of the many struggles that filmmakers run into when making a children's film is creating something that appeals to both the children and their parents, who will most likely be watching it with them. ""The Iron Giant"" is an example of one that completely succeeds in that area. The opening where Hogarth goes on the roof to check the antenna and then into the woods with the flashlight has much more suspense, as it appears to be night in the Signature Edition. The glowing power station and the Iron Giant getting shocked by the wires has much more pop in the Signature Edition. Hogarth coming up the stairs with the TV lighting the stairwell when he goes to check on the noise upstairs while watching TV is another good example.This is a really exciting and touching movie which highlights the intolerance and prejudice of people. Humans are out to destroy what they don't understand, rather than reaching out. The animation is superb, especially, the showdown at the end of the movie. The film leaves us guessing what the robot actually is- is he an alien from outer space, or a military experiment? This is an intelligent kids movie which will have you thinking about it after it has finished. Children will identify with the appealing lead character, as he struggles to help his friend. there are some really funny sequences in the film too, like when Hogarth gives Kent chocolate laxatives when he starts asking too many questions, and when the robot hand comes detached and starts wondering around the place.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",The Iron Giant
59,mike48128,An often overlooked Classic-Buy it Soon!,8,3 April 2014,"Cable used to run this all the time. In 1999 WB got out of feature animation for a while, after that disastrous ""Quest for Camelot"" misfire. An ambitious feature based on the book ""The Iron Giant"". This property had legs, and could have been a series if handled properly--it wasn't. It was a financial success, however. Intentionally set in the early 1950's around the time of such wonderful nonsense as ""War of the Worlds"", ""Invaders From Mars"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". A young boy finds a giant robot and at first nobody believes him. The original purpose of it was to conquer planets, as it has laser beams and sonic rays, like all good giant monsters, but all it really wants to be is friendly, like Superman. It eats scrap metal, not people. A paranoid government agent sees it as a threat to all Mankind, and an Army General and troops are sent to destroy it, of course. In the wrong hands, this would have been a terrible film, but along the way, we are treated to good, early CGI animation and a slightly-preachful storyline about ""being what you want to be"". Mild violence (""Bambi"" dies) and cuss-words: ""Hell"" used is few times. Make this inappropriate for very young kids, but otherwise quite acceptable. Your 8 to 10 year-old will love it! The T.V.""Evil-Brain Monster"" sequence is also a bit scary! Buy this while you still can! I have to watch my VHS ""First Men in the Moon"" a while longer, as I waited too long.

It's a heartwarming and tear-jerking adventure that still holds a special place in my heart as being an animated film that has the potency of a live-action film and showing that animation doesn't need to adhere to the Disney formula of songs, animals and princesses.

64,TheUnknown837-1,one of the best of the modern animated movies,10,30 November 2007,"Brad Bird's ""The Iron Giant"" is, in my opinion, a flawless and superb animated film that is well suited for the entire family. I saw it once in the theater and loved it from the start. A few years passed by before I saw it again and I loved it even before upon my second viewing. As I've gotten older, I've come to respect it even more for being a film of quality substance, excellent animation, humor, voice casting, and even great action sequences. It's a film that's not afraid to get violent from time to time, not even to show a tad bit of blood, but it doesn't go over its head to disturb the kiddies too much. That's why parents are recommended to view it with them.The animation designs of the characters and the voice actors who made them come to life verbally was absolutely perfect. The voice of Hogarth, our main human character, fitted very well with the animated design of the character. The character of Dean was just as good at being humorous and was not under-developed. The character of Kent Mansley, our main antagonist, was very well designed and acted. His overly large and forward-jutting eyebrows as well as his slender head and relatively calm voice was perfect for an animated villain. But who really steals the show is the Iron Giant himself, a giant hundred-foot-tall extra-terrestrial invention made of metal but containing a vast array of emotions, feelings, and thoughts somewhere within his several-ton metal body.Like I stated earlier, this film is not afraid to show a little violence or hard action. In fact, there's a lot of it. And it does not become overly powerful to be frightening, except maybe to young kids. Another thing is that it's not afraid to use a minimal amount of vulgar language, which is another reason why parental discretion is advised. But we have gunshots, explosions, and plenty of destruction on screen. But with no carnage. As far as I know, there is no body count in the entire film, which is appropriate. It makes the film suited for everybody.Aside from the action sequences, we have an extremely well-written storyline and plot. And it knows exactly which subplots of the film to emphasize and which ones to keep a minimal level, such as a small romantic subplot. It is shown enough to make the story compelling, but does not become too involved to distract us or slow the movie down. ""The Iron Giant"" almost seems a little bit too short for its brilliance, but nonetheless, it does play at a very reasonable running time.Bottom line, this is one of the best animated films there is out there. I highly recommend it for its brilliant animation styles, lovable characters, somewhat original plot, and overall style. It works out very well.",The Iron Giant

THE IRON GIANT is an example of one that completely succeeds in that area. While children (particularly boys) will appreciate the friendship of a boy with a giant robot, Brad Bird also manages to send up the Cold War era and provides a strong anti-gun message. For someone's debut film, I thought it was particularly impressive considering this is the same guy who would later make THE INCREDIBLES and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL. He shows a firm directorial hand and gets excellent voice performances from the talent involved. It also helps that the story is very streamlined, so there aren't any pacing issues. The story also takes a rather poignant turn in the end that is completely earned. If I had to pick a single favorite moment from the film, it would probably be the end. Overall, THE IRON GIANT is a touching children's film with a heavy dose of nostalgia for a simpler time. This is a great film that can be enjoyed by parents and children alike.",The Iron Giant

The Cold War was still at large, Sputnik was still active in space and made millions of Americans fear about Nuke attacks from the Soviets.On one stormy night in the Atlantic Ocean a meteorite comes landing into the eye of the hurricane. Only this isn't a meteorite. It's a artificial giant made out of iron. A boat navigator spotted the giant at sea and couldn't believe his own eyes.Meanwhile in a small town in Maine.

68,jaredmobarak,Duck and coverThe Iron Giant,8,4 March 2007,"I finally took the time to see writer/director Brad Bird's first foray into feature length film with The Iron Giant. Hearing how great of a film it was and the success of his Pixar debut The Incredibles, I've been seeing the movie on my shelf for a while now, just waiting to finally be viewed. If you thought his last movie had heart, you need to see this one. While being based on a book, I'm not sure if it is the original source material or Bird's vision on screen, but the parallels to King Kong are unmistakable. This creature from another world instills fear into all but one personone person who can see beneath the harsh exterior into the wealth of feelings and compassion bottled up within. Sure the beauty in a story like King Kong is the sacrifice he makes in order to keep his love safe at the unfortunate price of being a monster in the eyes of everyone else, but here we have a kid's story where happy endings aren't just a commonality but a necessity. Bird handles the subject matter nicely at the end in order to give the audience the same emotional attachment to the creature despite the fact that the general population does end up seeing him for what he truly is. Ala Superman/Spider-Man/ etc, the monster mystic soon dissolves as they begin saving human lives.A big part of The Iron Giant's success is the gorgeous animation. This may be one of the last great 2D animated films before CGI took over the field. The cinematic touches are great, including a depth of field composed of blurred images to give the audience a focal point. You forgive that the blurring effect renders the object even flatter than the medium does originally because the effect works as it would in a live-action film. Also, the lighting effects are wonderful, especially the flashlight sequences. When our young protagonist looks out his window into the woods, and the light flare goes from bright blind spot to illuminating band of vision, it looks very realistic. The power of the light even dissipates as the flash goes farther out into the distance. As with The Incredibles, though, the true heart of the film is in the fully fleshed out characters. There is not an overabundance of cluttered supporting roles, but instead a few main roles, which are allowed to evolve and grow an attachment from the viewers. The emotion etched into the movement and facial ticks of the Giant are spectacular at getting language across, much as would have been done in a silent film. Eli Marienthal does a great job as young Hogarth Hughes, the only one who believes that his new friend is more than a weapon. Christopher McDonald adds some nice comic relief as our only villainous role, albeit not a bad guy in the common use of the term, and Jennifer Aniston allows Mrs. Hughes to be both motherly and understanding of her son's adventures. The vocal star ends up being Harry Connick Jr., who is fantastic as Hogarth's friend and confidant when it comes to the new discovery of the Giant. I think the best compliment that a film like this can have is the fact that the vocal talent was so good I didn't recognize any as the people they are in real life. No one tried to infuse their own shtick into the part, but instead played the roles to enhance the story being told.Along with all that, we are treated to subtle commentary on the state of the government, both with the ""duck and cover"" absurdity of atomic warfare and the references to gun control and war. These jabs are just that though, small moments that go along with the story, rather than take it over and hijack the film like what happened with Happy Feet this year. Weighty issues can be addressed in children films successfully, making the audience understand the problem yet not shoving it down their throats when the real issue at hand is the relationship between a child and his new otherworldly friend, giving him the confidence to stand up for himself and be a hero.So far Bird has really impressed me as an animation director. While the teaser for Pixar's new Ratatouille left me a bit indifferent, just the attachment of this autuer's name makes me that much more excited for the movie. Hopefully Bird can keep the track record intact and also, maybe prove that in order for these films to be successful, a good story is necessary. In an age where we get around ten animated films a year, there are many that are horrible cashcows to rip off unsuspecting parents into taking the children to a cartoon. Thankfully Brad Bird shows us that animated films can still hold up against live action ones for the pieces of art they should aspire to be.",The Iron Giant

70,sharky_55,I am not a gun.,8,9 January 2016,"It is 1957 in the small town of Rockwell, Maine, and America is in the midst of the Cold War, so naturally this gives the film an aura of unsettledness and paranoia. And also naturally, children are less concerned with this, and take more risks, and their naivety leads to some unforeseen consequences. Brad Bird sprinkles a little social commentary in it too; sometimes it's delightfully light like the mock educational short film that displays the proper nuclear bombing etiquette to school children, or it's loud and brusque like the panicked way that G-man Kent Mansley defers to military action and presence whenever possible. We have the usual children's film conventions which signal themselves loudly: the lone boy who is bullied and causes trouble beyond his intentions, the snappy but good natured mother who glares at him pointedly after this fiasco, and the rest of the town, adult and children alike, whom do not believe his tall tale of a giant robot from outer space. What saves it from being generic is Brad Bird's direction which creates charm and genuine childhood terror and discovery without being juvenile. He does this first and foremost in the animation. Hogarth is given due attention, especially to his facial expressions which are given a wide range of lopsided smiles, glares, creased grimaces and wide eyed stares; see as his feet motor on Looney Tunes style when he attempts to flee the robot, or a particularly lively moment where he tries to pray whilst shooing the robot out of the house (not an uncommon scansion in children's films but it is done well, with restraint and with just the right amount of humour). The same goes for the robot, digitally animated but made to look hand drawn, whom moves with a slow but endearing recklessness. In one particular moment, he is spoken to like a child, or a dog, as he refuses to stop following Hogarth. Vin Diesel's pitch dropped, monotonous voice acting is perfect for this sort of misguided character, and has helped cement the film's iconic lines (""You stay. I go."") The discovery of the robot initially is handled with great nuance. Though it may be a child who stumbles across it, it isn't overly cartoonish and generates just the right amount of wonder and apprehension. The first sighting is this gigantic low angle shot of its eyes lighting up the lighting storm and it is genuinely awe inspiring and terrifying. Then later, this is replicated in his second appearance, before he gets stuck and we first feel something that resembles sympathy, and this comes easier for a child. Kamen's score is also crucial; a lively percussive based piece as Hogarth dresses up as a soldier and prepares himself for battle, thrilling as Hogarth flees and then makes his decision to save the robot, and in the finale, twinkles optimistically before flourishing in full fanfare to give us the ending we all hoped for. And finally the sound design which is just as important in building the characterisation of the robot and the initial anticipation of a non-threat; a big creaky whoosh as the robot crouches down to Hogarth's level, without menace, then a gigantic boom as it falls over onto its bottom, and the entire screen, and each layer of trees in the background shakes vigorously. It is not hard to see why The Iron Giant has become a cult classic. It does not have the iconicity or the Spielberg draw of E.T., but its story is just as touching and heartfelt. Brad Bird has in time shown his animation mastery with his Pixar work in The Incredibles and Ratatouille, but this remains an important stepping stone. Who knew that a linguistically challenged, lumbering giant robot could becomes such an endearing superhero figure?",The Iron Giant
71,Stampsfightclub,Sublime animation with strong message on violence,8,25 July 2009,"Lonely kid Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal) discovers a giant metal man which soon becomes the friend he as always wanted whilst a government agent seeks to destroy it.The Iron Giant brings together a sentimental story of a young lad with no friends but a vivid imagination and when The Giant comes down and the two share their first meeting, humour and sentimental emotions are flying around to make a wonderful film that is as sharp as many Disney pictures and is the first full length animation for the then relatively unknown Brad Bird.Bird would of course go on to win 2 Oscars (and possibly more) with so far The Incredibles and Ratatouille that had a subtle blend of humour and family magic, and this is where Bird began his magic in the animation industry.Based on Ted Hughes' book, The Iron Giant is scripted with an imaginative realism. It is designed around a lonely boy who unfortunately causes trouble with every pet he owns and his mother comes down hard on him when he tries to express his repressed feelings.Hogarth is a cheeky character that generates plenty good comedy in this picture. His imaginative nature makes you wish you were young whilst his enthusiasm at tackling exciting new opportunities, such as jumping in a freezing lake and going on his own adventures brings that accurate youthful mind that is scripted so exquisitely you will be flashing back to your own childhood.Like all Disney pictures, this Bird film has a strong message to portray to the younger generations. Lion King was the circle of life; Monsters Inc was child security whilst Robin Hood looked at the rich and the poor. Iron Giant has perhaps one of the strongest natured meanings at looking at life and death since Bambi. When The Giant is targeted he is triggered with a defence mechanism whilst Hogarth preaches to him about violence. It is powerful stuff that is all relative to the development of the young mind as this script looks to develop itself by looking at how to use violence and the context in which it is appropriate and when it is not. It is quite strong stuff, even for perhaps an older audience. When the Giant encounters the deer and the aftermath is very shocking. This by all means portrays the hard aspects of real life, blended with a sharp intake of science fiction.The means by which The Giant communicates and discovers the world's systems shows the contrasts with our world and the outer realms. The scope of technology the Giant brings is vastly different and we see a shocking look at other worldly technology versus the U.S Governments.The picture has its drawbacks. The humour is by no means on par with Pixar being awkwardly crude and in bad context.But significantly the rightful message is portrayed and it is a wonderfully made picture",The Iron Giant

Well done, Mr. Bird, please make us some more.",The Iron Giant
73,fwomp,Friendship. Love. Respect.,8,17 February 2008,"Friendship. Love. Respect. Growing up. These are the themes that run throughout THE IRON GIANT, an Oscar Award winning animated film from 1999. Kids films without substance are very familiar to most parents, but The Iron Giant hearkens back to a time when family and friendship meant everything.Although unusual in the sense that a boy named Hogarth (voiced by Eli Marienthal) befriends an alien robot simply called The Iron Giant (voiced by Vin Diesel), this animated feature still teaches kids the responsibilities of friendship and how devastating it can be to lose one.The set-up is common in that we see the military and government agents as bumbling morons who misunderstand the intentions of something as large and as powerful as a nearly indestructible robot. But understanding eventually reaches them, too, through the actions of Hogarth and his new alien buddy.More interesting than previous animation films for kids, this one shows not just the upside of this friendship, but the dangers ...as well as a fatal ending (sort of). Parents should be prepared to comfort their kids when The Iron Robot launches himself into space in preparation to save his best friend (Hogarth). The words ""Superman"" are uttered as The Iron Giant makes contact with the powerful and deadly rocket, and I'd be willing to bet that there's not an adult out there with any heart that won't swallow hard at those words.But there are plenty of fun and funny scenes to counter the more stark ones. Watching fellow humans complain to the local constabulary about suddenly absent mouthfuls of trucks, towers, and other metal munchables is pretty comical, as is a great scene where The Iron Giant does a cannonball jump into a favorite swimming hole of Hogarth's.A fun and serious film with themes that most parents will find a positive influence on the pliable minds of their young ones.",The Iron Giant
74,KnightsofNi11,Surprisingly incredible,9,29 July 2012,"Before director Brad Bird hit the big time directing acclaimed Pixar films The Incredibles and Ratatouille, he directed a little animated film for Warner Brothers called The Iron Giant. It's a story set in the Red Scare era about a giant robot that crash lands on Earth. A young kid named Hogarth happens to find this robot and the two quickly develop a strong and powerful friendship. However, Hogarth must keep his giant friend safe as a snooping government worker named Kent tries to find out what Hogarth is hiding and whether or not it's dangerous (ie. built by the Russians). This is an incredibly moving, incredibly powerful film with a lot more to it than meets the eye.The Iron Giant starts out simple enough. It's a story we've seen before. A young boy befriends a larger than life person or thing, highlighting the innocent and non judgemental eye of a child. But this film makes this recognizable motif so powerful and so emotionally enthralling. It hits emotional chords that send chills up and down your body as the film roots itself into your heart. This is a shockingly poignant film with so much heart and a constant thread of sincerity running through it, despite it being a cartoon.This leads me to the other impressive thing about the film is the fact that it's a cartoon. You would expect it to be more in the league of some of the sillier and more light hearted Disney films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame or 101 Dalmations. Instead, The Iron Giant is much more complex and is more mature and intelligent than these films. And the cartoon element also makes it a visual spectacle that is simultaneously larger than life and down to Earth. This sincere parallelism makes the film entertaining and exciting as well as real as the story and characters connect on a very human level, even including and especially the Iron Giant himself, who proves to be more loving and more compassionate than most of the humans in this film. The emphatic realism of this film is enough to bring a tear to one's eye, and indeed it does.Don't underestimate The Iron Giant because of its simple cartoon exterior. It has a heart and a brain, and it has a surprising level of poignancy to it. This is a truly fantastic film that breaks new ground and proves just how human and just how emotionally superb a cartoon can be. This is a film that can't be missed, and must be experienced by anyone with a soul.",The Iron Giant
75,bankofmarquis,A warm tale of friendship,8,14 June 2020,"In the 1990's, it was rare for a studio besides Disney to release an animated film. So when Warner Brothers (home of Bugs Bunny) decided to release an animated film, everyone expected it to be some sort of ""Looney Tunes"" and were sorely disappointed when it was not.And that is too bad...for the film that was released - THE IRON GIANT - is a wonderfully warm and heartwarming tale of friendship, acceptance and, yes, intolerance of those different from you, set against the backdrop of the Cold War of the 1950's.Marking the full length feature animation Directing debut by Brad Bird (THE INCREDIBLES), THE IRON GIANT tells the tale of young Hogarth, who finds a...well...Iron Giant... who has fallen to Earth from Outer Space. Hogarth befriends The Iron Giant and helps to hide him from Military-types who see this as a threat to the safety, security and superiority of the United States.Featuring the vocal talents of Jennifer Aniston, John Mahoney, Harry Connick, Jr., Christopher McDonald and Eli Marienthal (as Hogarth), this film is warm and inviting, showing ""good characters"" that you want to root for and spend time with spar with ""bad guys"" that you want to see defeated. All of this over a character that is naive to what is going on around him. Special notice should be made of Vin Diesel's vocal work as The Iron Giant. He says very few things, but the words that he does say, convey strong emotions.You can see the seeds of THE INCREDIBLES in this work of Director Bird. The action sequences are fun and effective and are off-set by slower, more personal, scenes of the characters getting to know - and interact with - each other. He shows a deft touch in balancing these items, finding the right amount of pathos and pace throughout.The main themes in this film - fearing that which you do not know/do not care to understand resonates to this day and is a reminder that kindness can go much further than fear/ignorance/intolerance.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Iron Giant
76,Animany94,Warner Bros'. masterpiece.,10,9 April 2018,"Only one and a half year prior to this heartfelt and passionate movie, WB released the bland and nonsensical Quest for camelot. That's a major improvement, because The Iron Giant delivers on every level! First of all, the setting of a Cold War America creates a wide range of possibilities of making conflict and is used to the fullest with a government agent being on the search for an unidentified fallen object. The tense atmosphere increases every time he acts, because of the relatability created by the setting. Speaking of the government agent, he is not the only character to add depth and dynamic to the movie, every character plays off of each other perfectly to add heart and soul to the movie's atmosphere. The relationship between the giant and the boy Hogarth is really heartfelt and well developed, what else could you desire but great main characters? The story about paranoia and how we perceive the unknown makes you think it's a dark and serious movie all throughout, but it manages to give some hillarious comedy as well without damaging the overall tone. Hogarth and the giant are lovely to watch and the junkyard owner share some hilarious moments with them when he discovers the giant.The animation has also taken a giant step upwards (no pun intended) since the underwhelming expirience in Quest for Camelot. The backgrounds are gorgeously detailed and mange to show the size of the giant's appearance in general and capture the even grander feel when he flies and especially in the epic climax. The design of the giant himself is also brilliantly done and how much emotion he is able to show despite the restraints of it.The initial release was not kind towards this animated gem due to bad marketing and lack of confidence in the movie from WB thanks to the failure of Quest for Camelot. I'm glad to see that The Iron Giant has gained praise over time and today is considered a modern classic. One of the best animated movies ever made if you ask me.",The Iron Giant

But then I heard that it was much better than the usual ""family film"" grool. I finally went and saw it, and I am glad I did.Combining elements of stories like ET, BLADE RUNNER, and WARGAMES, it is a great parable about anti-violence. Set during the paranoia of the 50s, it shows how humanity creates humanity and how violence creates just more violence. It has a message for the 90s and for all time. I am glad to hear a movie be so bold as to tell us the truth -- guns kill, and none of us have to be guns. We can be people.The animation in the film is beautiful with rich colors and believable characterization -- unlike the over-done wide-eyed stereotypes we keep getting in the assembly line Disney cartoons recently. This is a real family film -- both the kids and the adults can enjoy it. And to top it off, we have a robot who becomes a Christ figure. GO SEE IT!",The Iron Giant
78,Blue-Grotto,You Are Who You Choose to Be,8,4 August 2019,"You are who you choose to be. Some sort of rocket falls from space along the Maine coast in 1957. A gigantic robot emerges and cuts a swath through the boreal forest on the way to a small town. It could be a weapon of the Soviets, a monster, an alien invader bent on destroying the earth, and more. When the iron giant encounters in its path a nine-year-old boy, Hogarth, it displays gentleness, keen intelligence and the innocence of a child. Hogarth is not the only one, of course, who knows about the robot. A fearful, negative and self-centered government agent attempts to corner the iron giant and triggers some adverse and alarming reactions. As the US Army responds, the robot and boy have only each other to turn to.While this animated feature is simple and straightforward in appearance, it carries a profound and touching message. There are many people who want you to live in a box they built for themselves, full of fear and negativity, yet we should decide for ourselves who we want to be. Even Superman or Superwoman are not out of reach, as the Iron Giant reveals. Brad Bird, one of the inspirations behind the rising Pixar Studio, reveals in this film why he is worth a damn.

79,Movie-12,"An entertaining and heartfelt cartoon version of ""E. T."" and ""Star Kid. *** out of ****.",8,25 January 2000,"THE IRON GIANT (1999) ***Starring the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Christopher McDonald, and Eli Marienthal Directed by Brad Bird. Running time: 87 minutes. Rated PG (for animated violence and mild language) By Blake French:	""The Iron Giant"" is much like a cartoon version of ""E. T: The Extraterrestrial"" and ""Star Kid."" It is an effective, empathetic journey into the life of its characters. Although the film is animated, it keeps a mature edge on its concepts. There are no outrageous characters, over the top musical numbers, or a bombarding number of shallow, unbelievable happenings. This is an animation in which children will enjoy for its message, but also adults because of its qualities and depth. If we were to replace the cartoons with real people, that would be possible here. That is how down to earth this movie is.	The story details the life of a lonely boy named Hogarth Hughes, who is about nine years of age. He lives a very dual and boring lifestyle with his mother, Annie. He has made a hobby of gathering animals from the wild to be his household pets. His mother is a very busy individual, working full time as a waitress for a small town coffee shop.	This is a fabulous, descriptive opening. We learn several elements about the characters, structure, as well as the movie's style. We learn that Hogarth's single mother is extremely busy and has little time with her son. We also see that due to the significant time this child spends alone, he has a great imagination. This is the internal problem, that Hogarth is somewhat lonesome spending all this time by himself. This film has well-developed characters, better than some more adult movies.	One day, while alone in the house watching television, something happens to Hogarth. His electrical power supply to his TV set goes bad. In a desperate attempt to fix the problem, he climbs on the roof of his house to discover half his antenna has been bitten off. What could have done this? The first clue is the massive footprints leading into the woods. Whatever made these prints destroyed everything in its path. The thing that caused the destruction, technical difficulties, and placed colossal holes in the ground, is a massive iron giant from space who has recently crash landed on earth. Hogarth quickly greets the robot and makes friends with it. The story propels from there after we see the humanity and gentle attitude of the android whom we share empathy with and are able to understand and relate to. The first act is solid and clear cut, proving to us that this is not only a well-animated cartoon, but also a well structured one. 	The film introduces the external problem when an insane detective places his nose where it doesn't belong and discovers the gigantic metal creature. Hogarth is forced to keep his robot secret so that it is not taken away. This detective's purpose in ""The Iron Giant"" serves as more than meets the eye. His motives are understandable and developed, although shows signs of existing as a plot device rather than a real character. Also, he is used to increase the line of dramatic tension as he grows closer and closer to finding the robot. This is a very sufficient and well-written character who contributes to a lot of positive material and many possibilities for the film.  The only problem I had with the film is how it never actually explained what the iron giant was. It is an amazing creature, able to heal itself, shoot out lasers, contribute in conversations, and yet we never know how it is able to do these things. Did it come from another plant seeking help for its dying race? Is it on a mission to gather important materials for its existence? Perhaps the android was built by a cruel human inventor on earth but was overtaken by the size of it ands thus allows it to escape into space and become lost--leaving the iron giant no choice but to return to his home where he discoursed along the way and crashed. The possibilities are endless. Too bad the filmmakers took such a shallow look at our title character, otherwise, this would have been one of the year's most entertaining family films.

I haven't seen a general certificate film for years through frustration at the corny over commercialised cynical tripe dished out by the Disney corporations of the cinema world, but I really enjoyed this animated feature.A small boy befriends an alien killing machine robot and changes his ways in 1950s USA, with all the paranoia over the Russians, the Cubans and Nuclear War in the background.This is a delightful little story as the boy and his mother have a government agent move in on them and bully the boy, Hogarth, as the army tries to destroy the giant alien machine.Most enjoyable was the comical parody of the 'duck and cover' informational films, which was quite funny and almost Ren and Stimpy-esque.",The Iron Giant

The movie is able to reproduce the mood and style of the era, even the animation style, but with all the improvements that technology has brought to animation.The characters are psychologically drawn with great talent, as it couldn't be otherwise by a Warner Bros's movie, and it is just them, their human qualities, what makes the viewer click with them and believe they are real. Moreover, the cartoons have a superb body movement, facial expression.The script is engaging and very entertaining, very funny and lovable. At the same time, the film address serious social and political issues in a simple approachable way, without lecturing: You are who you decide to be, if you respond to violence is your option., it is in your hands to make your own destiny no matter what your past is, your heart is always a great power to connect with others, no matter how different they are. Great messages to pass on to children.Eli Marienthal is terrific as the little hero Hogarth Hughes. Jennifer Aniston is extremely lovable as his mother Annie (perhaps Aniston's best performance ever...),.Harry Connick Jr is very likable as the quirky Dean McCoppin, Vin Diesel very sweet as the ""brute"" Iron Giant, and Christopher McDonald terrific as the annoying paranoid Govt Agent Kent Mansley. In fact all the voice actors are terrific, and the movie is never dull, but cheerful and full of life thanks to them.The Iron Giant did not have success at the box office when first released, due to poor marketing and a lack of promotion, but it has proved to be one of the most charming, entertaining and lovable animation movies of all times, to be put together with Miyazaki's and other classics of animation because of the quality of its animation and story.A classic for both children and adults",The Iron Giant
82,elicopperman,A Cinematic Landmark that Stood the Test of Time,9,15 January 2020,"Back in the late 90s, when most theatrical animation was trying to emulate the success of the Disney renaissance, along came a smaller albeit unique feature from Warner Bros. called The Iron Giant. Despite receiving critical acclaim, it was a box office flop on its original release due to poor marketing. However, thanks to a growing cult following on VHS and DVD, and the film's director Brad Bird creating Pixar powerhouses like The Incredibles and Ratatouille, the film eventually went from an underrated gem to one of the greatest animated features ever made. After over 20 years in its existence, I think it's time to owe back its debt.Set in 1950s America during the Cold War, the film follows Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant intergalactic metal robot. In response to the U.S. military, Hogarth must fend them off from destroying the Giant. The movie's main plot is a mix of the common young child meets strange creature narrative and the old fear of beings beyond our worlds common in 1950s sci-fi films. What makes the otherwise familiar storyline fascinating though is how it develops the Giant as a legitimate character, from letting its monstrous size tell many scenes themselves and Hogarth mentoring it like a father teaching its son all the advantages in becoming good, as if a machine could actually have a soul. As for the sci-fi aesthetic, the film cleverly plays around with the themes of paranoia from nuclear war common back then with a supernatural twist, since what's beyond their world was too much for them to even comprehend. Of all the films to blend thrilling sci-fi, atomic fear and heartfelt tenderness together, this movie knocks it right out of the ballpark.As this is a character driven story, almost every figure in the movie plays an important part in some shape or form. With Hogarth being a rebellious albeit responsible kid, he also has the misfortune of his single mother working overtime, which makes his role to the giant as a teacher all the more engaging. In fact, because the Giant is often curious about the new world of Earth, he learns more from the values of friendship and life through Hogarth and the beatnik artist Dean, making their bonds all the more sincere and heartwarming. Speaking of Dean, he's more of a hip outcast to society that makes his own artwork from scrap and junk, yet that all leads to him reluctantly becoming part of the Giant's presence. Then there's the antagonist Kent Mansley, who perfectly represents how the government wanted America to think in the 50s, as he believes anything outside the U.S. and Earth is a threat and must be destroyed for the ""good"" of humanity. Rarely have animated characters been this relatable and this human before, including a giant metal robot.Even for a movie that strayed away from the Disney formula in the 90s, the film is animated nearly as well as any product from the Mouse House. Brad Bird is known for his exaggerated and stylistic character designs, and this film is no exception, as every character sticks out based on their physique and personality. The character animation adds in smooth movements, realistic attributes common in human anatomy and bold gestures that sell the performances. However, the film's true highlight has to be the CG work done on the Giant itself, as the crew created it with a cel-shaded approach that helps it blend extraordinarily well with the hand-drawn characters. The lack of overly detailed lighting also helps, since it keeps the contrast of the Giant simple and easy to look at without coming off as distracting. Also, major applause must be given to the cinematography and shot composition, as every color and every single frame conveys what the scene is communicating emotionally, whether it'd be completely visual with no dialogue or an intense thrilling scene with quick cuts and frightening glares.Needless to say, The Iron Giant stands the test of time thanks to its heartfelt story, themes of acceptance over fear, lovable characters and wonderful animation. If you're yet to check this film out for yourself, then this is a must watch for anyone, not just film and animation buffs. It's not common that a feature communicates the idea that supposedly dangerous weapons could actually have a soul to them, yet this film found a way to do so through humor, pathos and ideologies that are still common today. Remember, even things we might take for granted can have more substance than we give them credit for.",The Iron Giant
83,acedj,Does a familliar story equal a bad movie?,8,2 April 2020,"The short answer is I think not. This is the story of a young boy named Hogarth that grew up in the 1950's. His dad is not in the picture and we can deduce that he dies in world war two from a picture Hogarth has. Essentially friendless, Hogarth has a vivid imagination and a sens of wonder that we all lose as we age. He discovers a giant robot and befriends him. Yes, in similar fashion to ET, the Hogarth tries to hide the giant from the authorities. Also like ET, he fails. However unlike that movie there is a great conflict between the giant and the military.This is a very heartwarming story and I am forever sad that there was never a sequel made to it, as it was worthy of another visit, yet the box office earnings were too low. My only problem with this film is that it is clearly meant to dissuade people from owning guns. Typical Hollywood bull, jamming their beliefs down our throats.

Here we have an intelligent, and entertaining film about a boy who befriends a giant robot from origins unknown.   The characters are not dumbed down in anyway, and there is no need to break out into song as many recent animated films have done.  We are carried along by the story and the curiosity about what will happen next to Hogarth and his giant friend.   One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end when the Giant and Hogarth are knocked out of the sky. Once they land, the Giant shows more emotion and range than many living actors can muster. The result is a scene that's full of power and emotion.  The climax of the film is fitting, but I can't say what it is, you have to see it for yourself.  A great film to show to the entire family.",The Iron Giant

And criminally underrated,10,23 January 2008,"Before Brad Bird found success with The Incredibles and Ratatouille, he directed this little seen film, The Iron Giant. Bird is one of the true auteur's of modern animation. Despite only three films to his name, the man is quite simply a genius. His films represent the finest examples of family entertainment. Ones that appeal to adults and children alike. And he understands what makes a film accessible to a child. You don't talk down to them. Just talk to them.The Iron Giant was given a curious lack of advertising by Warner Bros. It was just dumped into cinemas with very little advance notice. And not surprisingly, The Iron Giant did next to no business. And that is a real shame. Because its one of the greatest animated films you will ever see.Taking a leaf out of ET's book, and based on the short story by Ted Hughes, The Iron Giant follows the tale of a 100-foot robot that crashes to Earth in Rockwell, Maine, 1957. Bird has deliberately set the film in Cold War America. In fact the setting is just days after the Russians launched the Sputnik satellite. So the atmosphere is expectedly tense and paranoid. Most Americans of that era thought anyone who wasn't a member of the USA was their enemy. And its unfortunate The Iron Giant should have to land on Earth during such a dark era.Hogarth Hughes is a schoolboy obsessed with the stars. He watches all the classic B-movies. Collects all the comics. Has posters of Forbidden Planet proudly displayed on the walls of his bedroom. But when the TV goes on the blink one night, Hogarth goes outside and investigates. Their antenna has been bitten off the roof. Someone has left a trail of destruction behind them. Cars. Wagons. And when Hogarth follows them, he comes across The Iron Giant.When Hogarth saves him from being electrocuted at a power plant, the two become fast friends. Hogarth sort of adopts him, and has to go to great lengths to conceal him from the outside world. No easy task considering his insatiable appetite for metal. And when a government agent comes snooping around, it isn't long before war breaks out between the townspeople of Rockwell and the innocent Iron Giant.Anyone who hasn't seen this film must go out and buy it immediately. Because you are missing out on one of the most perfect family films ever conceived. Brad Bird never puts a foot wrong. He strikes the perfect balance between comedy, action and touching sentiment. Its a film where you never feel like you're being patronised or lectured to.Although ET did spring to mind while I was watching this film (and Bird has worked with Steven Spielberg in the past), I think The Iron Giant is far superior. ET felt (to me anyway) like a calculated attempt on Spielberg's part to push all the right emotional buttons at perfectly timed intervals. I never felt any manipulation during The Iron Giant.Bird crafts the friendship between Hogarth and his new friend with surprising sophistication. Hogarth's attempts to humanise the machine is conducted with real skill and expertise. Since Hogarth knows they're living in dangerous times, he knows exactly how the people will react if they saw The Iron Giant. They'll only see a monster. Something alien. And in they're minds, anything that's alien must be destroyed.Bird also does a great job evoking the atmosphere of 1950's Cold War America. The film has many accurate details that will immediately strike a chord with anyone of that era. Such as the disturbing Duck and Cover programmes. And Bird makes sure the fear and uncertainty of the times are neatly represented too. Like paranoid conspiracy nuts and straight arrow Army Generals.But the crux of the film is Hogarth's friendship with The Iron Giant. The way these two outsiders find a friend in each other. The film gets a lot of mileage out of the different adventures they get up to. Whether it be slapstick, like Hogarth doing a cannonball into a lake, and when the Giant tries it, he ends up draining all the water. Or sentiment, like when Hogarth discovers what the Giant really is.The film has a very strong anti-gun statement to make. None more so than the scene when the pair come across a deer in the woods shot by hunters. Hogarth makes a very impassioned speech about how its wrong to kill. And how to make the right choice.Its genuinely shocking to discover the Giant is a weapon. His crash to Earth has robbed him of that knowledge. But his programming kicks in whenever he feels threatened. Something not helped by the Army coming to take this 'monster' down.The Iron Giant has to make a choice between being a gun, and being a person. Which will he choose? Or will his programming make the choice for him? Pretty heady material for a so-called kids film.Brad Bird has a clear love of retro futurism, something he lavishly displayed in The Incredibles, and here too. The Iron Giant is a tall, galumphing behemoth. But Bird does a great job making him seem endearing, especially with a surprisingly animated metal face. And the different weaponry inside of him is pretty inventive too. He's got more add-ons than the Swiss Army!Things come to a very moving conclusion when the Giant must sacrifice himself for Hogarth and the people who hate him. Its very saddening, and will leave you feeling depressed for days afterwards. Odd to feel such compassion for an animated character isn't it?The Iron Giant is an unforgettable experience. One of the finest animated movies ever made. And all the more remarkable for having the ability to move and enchant you as much as it does.",The Iron Giant

88,EthanBJones_03,I could argue this movie to be the greatest Animated movie ever made.,10,18 December 2016,"Overall: Honestly, this movie is a masterpiece. I could argue this movie be the greatest animated movie ever made, up there with The Lion King and Toy Story. The movie is just incredible and I dare you not to feel something at the ending.Good: The animation in this movie is beautiful and is full of detail. The acting is incredible. It displays Vin Disel's acting ability by making me love a character and nearly tear up at the end by saying very very few words. The music is incredible. All the characters are great and have traits, even if in few supply, that make you love them. The villain is a slimy toad and you really dislike him but despite this he is also an incredible character. The story is genius and the message of 'You are who you choose to be' behind it is amazing and moving. There are some gut wrenching jokes and just tear jerking scenes. Not one scene feels like a waste. Not one act feels dragged out or pointless. Bad: The proportion of Hogarth's neck is weird. It is not as suitable for families which some distressing scenes and not AS MUCH humour in it as say a standard Disney or Dreamworks movie.Best Part: The Final SacrificeMVP: Vin Deasel as The Iron Giant",The Iron Giant
89,tankace,If only Transformers were so good.,9,26 June 2016,"Iron Giant is one of the movies ,which stick to me as a kid and now in my adult life I remember it finely. What really bothers me is the fact that this flick bombed at the box office, WHY? Did the Giant suffered enough already? Any way this is also one of the last hand drawn animated movies to be made before their type ,when close to extinct in the twenty first century. For just think how many animated flicks were in theaters(video movies don't count) in last decade and a half, which weren't made with computers, I am sure that three to five is the maximum number for most of us, for by experience know only five! FIVE, in Fifteen years !Now I don't for any reason hate Nemo, Toy Story ,WALL-E, Ice Age and Schrek, no are some of my favorites and Lego was hilarious. What I am saying is that Iron Giant apart from its great story, images and moments ""You stay ,I go, No following"" ,man I still cry when I think of it, had also the ""luck "" to see its kind in its last days of glory, before Pixar and Dreamworks took over the industry. #MOLOPOLY!To the film itself ,at the high of the space race a robot from space crash land in the USA and befriends a boy, which teach it, who to be like superman. The effects are great and even the setting look accurate for the fifties period, why it earn 23 million to a budget of 70? The answers are ,the Six Sense which opened the same week, with the Giant and blew audiences away and the themes were judged by many parents as too adult. For real I feel go to an adult in the twenty first century and see an animated film and not be laugh at for that, in the end a good flick, is a good flick, end of story, because that argument of 1999 is obvious stupid!If you haven't show it to your kids yet, do it, JUST DO IT! Bonus if Micheal Bay had think of making the Tranformers ,more in line of this film the films would be so much better.",The Iron Giant
90,smakawhat,Spectacular!!,10,21 May 2001,"Fantastic family film about an Iron Giant robot that falls from the skies in the late 50's.  A young kid named Hogarth finds a 50 foot tall steel eating 'Iron Giant', after discovering it trapped in a power plant station.  After saving the giants life, the two bond and Hogarth has to figure out how to keep the whole thing a secret, as a nosy government agent arrives in town convinced there's an enemy 'something' created either by the Russians or martians that must be destroyed.This is the perfect animated film, the giant looks great and has a neat personality and a cool sounding voice (like synthesized grinding metal). There's also enough humour to keep things a little on the lighter side.  But the movie shines spectacularly in its portrayl of a 'friendly giant' and a kid who tries to convince the world that he's harmless.  This is a total setup for a very sappy, preachy, and didactic story line, but the film is not like that at all.  It comes out with the ingenious of an aesop fable handled with great simplicity and without being a paint by numbers moral lesson.  Great for kids and even better for adults.Rating 10 out of 10.",The Iron Giant
91,jldmp1,Perspectives,9,21 June 2006,"This ran a big risk of going horribly wrong, but Brad Bird shows in his first feature that he knows how craft a new whole out of genre parts, while keeping his eye on the big picture. The opposite of this movie would be the execrable ""Independence Day"", where the whole decidedly was a good deal less than the sum of the pieces.Part of his crafting solution is to take a story set in the past, that's about the past, and keeping the feel of the visual and vocal expression in the past -- no referential pop-culture hokum. Obviously, this is composed from parts of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""E.T."", ""Terminator 2"", ""Godzilla"" and countless 50's B movies. What matters is that this is smarter than all those put together. The way this shatters old perspectives is placed directly in the visual narrative -- the part where the kid watches the brainlessly stupid movie about the man-eating brain -- all intended to point out the superior intelligence of what we have here.Secondly, the use of the Giant's exaggerated height gives Bird the advantage of exaggerating the perspective of the 'camera'. He gets to play with focus and composition -- this is superbly detailed from every angle and in every trajectory...Anime without the losses in translation.",The Iron Giant
92,ExpendableMan,A wonderful piece of film making,9,21 January 2005,"It is a tremendous shame that this film has reached such a small audience as in my humble opinion, its one of the finest animated pictures to come out of the US. Sure, it does not pack the epic scope of The Lion King, but it is a very touching (but not schmaltzy) work and is one of those films that can literally bring a smile to your face that will not leave for days.Set in the 1950's, it tells of a young American boy obsessed with science fiction comics and movies, who befriends a massive, alien robot that has crash landed in the countryside surrounding his home. The two form a bond as he gradually teaches the giant about his world and the story then focuses on his attempts to keep the giant hidden from a US government official and the military. Not easy when you're a 30 feet tall, clanking mechanical marvel with footprints the size of cars.Along the way, there are plenty of sly touches. The feel of the 1950's is perfectly realised with milkshake shops, bad horror films and the sense of paranoia that came from being one of two super powers dominating the world. The animation too is beautifully done, with even the metallic eyes of the Giant displaying tremendous emotion behind them. The story at times is very sentimental, but it's also loaded with a knowing sense of wry humour and though this may be a film with a child audience squarely in mind, I defy even the toughest of souls not to feel a little choked up come the ending.",The Iron Giant
93,eshwarmail,"Though it is done with right intentions, it is strictly a kids movie.",7,6 January 2017,"Reviewed August 2011I had great expectations on this from hearsay but doesn't quite live up to all of them. Since I am watching it quite late, it felt like a combination of 'How to train your dragon' and 'Super 8'. A huge robot descends from the sky and has a rocky landing that makes it forget what it is. It reaches a small sedate village looking for metal to eat when a boy stumbles upon it and saves the giant from getting electrocuted. The giant grows an affection towards the boy and the boy teaches him words and general human stuff. When the government comes to know of it and comes with it's big guns, the giant has to remember what the boy has thought him. The animation and mannerisms of the characters are very Disney like swaying away gaily. The story centers a lot on friendship and righteousness while the robot structure is too corny. It has to eat metal to survive, shows those funny expressions while showing emotions etc. Some action sequences at the end are pretty decent though. Though it is done with right intentions, it is strictly a kids movie.",The Iron Giant

A must see!",The Iron Giant
95,Stompgal_87,An underrated animated gem from the late 90s,9,30 December 2013,"I fondly remember watching this when I was about 12 or 13 and like 'The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot,' this is another animated film from my youth I had forgotten about for several years until the Nostalgia Critic reminded me of it by placing it at no. 6 in his 'Top 11 Underrated Classics,' which also included the likes of 'The Prince of Egypt' and 'Babe: Pig in the City' that I had also seen during my pre-teen years.So back to 'The Iron Giant.' The animation was mostly smooth but jarring in places and there seemed to be a continuity error with regard to Hogarth's eyes - in some shots they had pupils in others they didn't. Other than the jarring movements and alleged continuities, the Iron Giant blended with the 2D animation perfectly since he didn't look anything like a CGI character and I liked the black and white animated segments that were used for the televisions and the bombing protection public information film shown at Hogarth's school. The film, although animated, had some realistic elements such as the Iron Giant eating metal that stayed true to the Iron Man eating metal in the Ted Hughes book and reminded me of a task I did at primary school where we were put into pairs and had to create a menu for the Iron Man that included ingredients such as chicken wire and oil. There were also some realistic and effective uses of colour and lighting such as the camera pan from a sunset sky to an autumnal landscape and the pale blue lighting as Hogarth followed the Iron Giant to an electric substation. The incidental music was initially forgettable but I found it fitting to the story when I re-visited the film this evening. As for the story itself, I found it a creative spin on the Hughes book that had a mixture of funny, somewhat crude and touching moments; the funny ones including the squirrel running rampage around the diner; the crude ones including Hogarth pretending to suffer from constipation as he tries to push the Iron Giant's hand out of the bathroom window and later sprinkling 'Coco-Lax' onto Kent's drink; and the touching ones including Hogarth's ever- increasing friendship with the Iron Giant and teaching him about death being a part of life upon witnessing a deer having been shot (it's Bambi all over again albeit less powerful. The story also has some educational value, especially Hogarth teaching the Iron Giant about the human world around him and that killing people or animals is a bad thing. Moving on to the voice acting, Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mother Annie and Vin Diesel, who pulled off the Iron Giant's voice as well as Robby Benson did with the Beast's voice in 'Beauty and the Beast,' were the standouts but Harry Connick Jr. as Dean and Eli Marienthal as Hogarth also did a great job with their roles. The ending of the missile destroying the Iron Giant, a statue of him being unveiled in the park and his separate parts moving in Iceland is unforgettable and moving without being too sentimental. I can even remember calling the film's setting Roswell instead of Rockwell as corrected by my then-babysitter and it was thoughtful of the film makers to dedicate this film to the memory of Ted Hughes during the closing credits.To conclude, I originally gave this an 8/10 due to finding some scenes more memorable than others but I upgraded it to a 9 because I enjoyed watching this even more than I did when I was a pre-teen/teenager.",The Iron Giant
96,kikiboo_8,Quite overrated,5,4 December 2020,"It's ok, but absolutely nothing special whatsoever.

It's almost like a childhood memory that every time you watch it, it's a different experience. This may be one of my favorite animated movies of all time. The Iron Giant illustrates friendship in a somewhat odd way, with a robot from outer space. The writing and the voicing is almost perfect and the whole animation thing wears away a little after you keep watching. It feels like a real movie with real emotions and that's what it is. I swear the ending is chilling and emotional to see. But the film bonds together the two in the most unique way and the kid shows the Iron Giant rules and lessons about the world they live in. So that pretty much sums it up, this film is a beautiful experience with a heartwarming friendship that is so interesting to see unfold. Aside from being animated (not really that big of a problem, especially how you just forget about it) this film is a must-see. 8/10.",The Iron Giant
98,Shiva-11,Great animation and storyline make for a wonderful film,7,7 August 1999,"Iron Giant - boy befriends giant robot from space -  Part ET, part Ghandi, with a dash of Bambi.Whenever I hear a lot of positive reviews about a movie I am instantly suspicious.  I went expecting to see an all right Disney wannabe and was pleasantly surprised. The animation is excellent - a fusion of  American Pop and  Heavy Metal - and helps recreate the atmosphere of 50's (I especially enjoyed the ""Duck and Cover"" film they were watching at school). 
The story is thoroughly engaging for both kids and adults (however I recommend you may want to miss the early screenings - I lost a good 5 minutes of dialogue to screaming children). Best of all, it's nice to see an animated film without distracting musical numbers (don't get me wrong, I like musicals as well as the next guy) because done wrong they will handicap a movie (Prince of Egypt comes to mind.  Also, I think it considerable courage to take an anti-violence stance and say something as radical as ""Guns kill people"" (the NRA won't be endorsing this film any time soon). This movie did not fail to deliver on any level and I will be seeing it again.Michael Eisner may want to cash in a few more of his options while they're still worth something, because if this is a preview of things to come from WB, there is a definite contender for the Disney crown.",The Iron Giant

It manages to entertain to the fullest, and not a single scene is too stupid or annoying for the average audience to watch. Adults, especially those growing up in the 50s or 60s, will relate well to this film, knowing what it was like to grow up during the trials and uncertainties of the Cold War. ""The Iron Giant"" tells the story of young boy Hogarth Hughes befriending a gigantic metal robot who has crash-landed on the earth from space. The government is suspicious, as usual, and wants to destroy the robot. Hogarth teaches the robot the truths and choices of using his powers for good rather than evil. What makes up this film is a very fun collection of humor and suspense. The humor is top-notch, from Hogarth saying grace and trying to hide the robot's missing hand at the same time to Hogarth's hyped-out experience after drinking espresso. It is also compelling and touching, as Hogarth and the giant must make choices and learn lessons throughout the film. What an enjoyable film.

It's a very touching story and one with deep meaning. I really like director Brad Bird's pitch ""What if a gun had a soul and didn't want to be a gun?"".

103,Rathko,Animation the Old-Fashioned Way,7,23 July 2007,"'The Iron Giant' is a very loose adaptation of Ted Hughes' 1968 children's classic 'The Iron Man'. Whereas the original novel was a poetic and lyrical fairytale that read like modern mythology, Brad Bird's movie is a straight up sci-fi movie in the vein of 'E.T.' Set during the era of the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the ensuing Cold War panic, the whole thing looks like the kind of movie that Disney used to make at the time, all beautifully painted backdrops and hand-drawn characters. The evocation of the era is very well done, with a careful and detailed eye for period ephemera and styling. It's a gentle and affectionate movie with a distinct lack of the knowing, adult-oriented, pop-culture referencing attitude of most recent animation. But this back-to-basics approach, while refreshing, seems a little too simple, too naïve, and too superficial. It's a good movie, and one I would encourage children to see, but a lot of rich potential was sorely missed.",The Iron Giant
104,TuckMN,A classic,9,17 August 1999,"I thoroughly enjoyed this animated film.While there are a few things I did not think were perfect they are too nit-picky to even mention.The moral messages were a bit heavy handed but over all what was being said was valid.I do wonder if a children's movie can be made any more without some kind of moral hitting you over the head.The characters were quite appealing and the story line is extremely well done.It does have you on the edge of your seat wondering just how it will all end.Some of the messages it imparted were a bit heavy handed for adult audiences -- and I do not think that kids would understand the whole ""Duck and Cover"" routine.  In some ways I think it tries a bit to hard to appeal on a cross-generational level.But all being said I did enjoy this movie and what it was saying to anyone that saw and understood it.",The Iron Giant

It's supposed to be for children, yes, but even older audiences can appreciate a film like this. It has aspects of wonderful science fiction action and adventure. I would say its a somewhat emotional movie as well. The giant is obviously sent to invade the earth and attack humans, but because of the ""bump on his head"", he has forgotten his mission and is, as a child, slowly exploring the world around him and beginning to understand the facts of life. I've seen this film literally about 50 times since I was a kid, to the present day, and I can safely say, even watching it as an adult, that its a wonderful movie for the family of all ages to enjoy together.",The Iron Giant
106,BabelAlexandria,"Who Is the Iron Giant, and Why has he Come to Earth?",9,19 February 2021,"Neither of these questions is answered in this charming movie, based on a novel by Ted Hughes, but it doesn't seem to matter. The Iron Giant is highly emotional film, but in an understated way. The scenes of 1950s small town Maine were highly evocative without being overly nostalgic. Hogarth is a great role model for young boys, even if he can be a bit impulsive and doesn't always listen to authority figures: he cares deeply for animals, and in this case, his robot friend, whom he looks after and instructs as if a young child. Not having experienced that era myself, the depiction of the Iron Giant nonetheless reminded of postwar Science Fiction covers, as in Tales to Astonish, etc., even if his gentle character did not. And I liked the anti-gun theme: Hogarth's toy gun ""triggers"" the self-defense mechanism in the robot, who gradually learns of his strength and automated programming, and, with the help of Hogarth, fights it: ""I am not a gun."" I also appreciated the ambiguity of the robot: is it aliens? Russians? Does it matter?Watched in February 2021, all three of us really enjoyed it.

107,AnishMisra,The Iron Giant Review,9,19 July 2018,"The Iron Giant is a film co-written and directed by Brad Bird. This film was on my radar for quite some time since it is directed by Brad Bird. Finally, I decided to watch the film and I can say that it was definitely great.Plot: Hogarth befriends a giant robot but also has to defend the robot from a ruthless government official.Story and direction: This film was in the traditional animation form which incorporated little CGI. At a time when CGI films were on the rise, bringing out such a film is a risk. With Brad Bird as the captain of the ship, what is to go wrong?? Nothing. Director's like Brad Bird is why I love animated films. Not only do they have such a good story but a message that is relevant and should be applied too in real life. This film deals with themes that no one at the time dealt with and is still relevant even in this world where technology has dominated every aspect of our lives. The film also very beautifully shows that it is not necessary to be human to have feelings. Everyone has feelings. Brad Bird and his team were able to grasp my attention in this 87 minute film. But it is quite sad to know that this film didn't work wonders at the time of its release. Some things quite notable are the designs for the town and the robot. They are impeccable and beautiful. Even the characterization work in the film is just spot-on. The bond formed between Hogarth and the robot seems real. Kent's character has been beautifully portrayed in the film. Even the voice work of this film is excellent and I couldn't fault it for even a second. There are some jokes in this film that I laughed and also some scenes which made me very emotional. The music by Michael Kamen also does wonders and goes with the flow of the film. If I had to nit-pick this film for any flaw, I would say it was the story. Many movies have shown such stories and the subject I would say was nothing new.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Hogarth decides to tell a bed-time story to the robot so that he could fall asleep. He has different books with him and tells them the gist of two of them. This scene just resonated with the main theme the film deals with and very correctly justifies the difference between good and evil.Verdict: As a first timer director, Brad Bird just hit a bulls eye. I was impressed with almost every aspect of the film. This film proves that medium is not necessary to bring across your point. If the message is correct and properly shown, then the medium doesn't matter that much. Even after the film ended, I was thinking about the film. And thank god, the film wasn't made into a musical (which was actually the original plan of the makers). For those who have loved Brad Bird animated films and think that he is one the great animators at present, I urge you to watch this film. It is a beautiful and thought provoking feature. I was highly impressed by it and sure that you will be too.I am going with a 9/10.",The Iron Giant

With the help of a beatnik scrapyard owner, he takes on a government agent filled with Cold War paranoia in order to save their iron friend. The Iron Giant is funny, thoughtful and has heart. The script respects the intelligence of young and old, and the under-90 minutes running time attests to the brisk pace and judicious lack of exposition. Our hero Hogarth has a child-like curiosity about his new friend, and a fierce loyalty, all the while keeping sentimentality in check. A quasi-religious theme is lightly threaded through, and an anti-war message is more more strongly foregrounded. But none of these elements detract from an engaging tale of a young boy who is bullied at school looking out for his new-found friend. A good example of what animation can achieve when the screenplay is considerate of its audience.",The Iron Giant

However, what Iron Giant is different at are a few things.The animation for one thing. It's a classic cartoon style, but assisted with computers. I think it worked out great for the movie.The relation between the boy and giant slowly builds up and is fun to watch. There are some touching scenes.There's also some nice humor in here. The Iron Giant is a fun, heartwarming family film.I can recommend this title to just about everyone. It's a great movie!8 out of 10 stars.",The Iron Giant
113,Simon_Says_Movies,"As touching, funny and timely a film as any committed to celluloid",10,26 May 2009,"Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form, but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters, including the giant, were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background, taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.Brad Bird who began with significant role in The Simpson's cartoon, marks his feature film debut, and would follow up with the even superior films The Incredibles and Ratatouille. The Iron Giant is part political statement, part satire and part family fare, but contains more substance then most children's films, containing passionate and is reminiscent of classics such as ET and The Lion King. Based on the book by Ted Hughes, the tale tells of a young boy in Rockwell, Maine named Hogarth Hughes voiced by unknown Eli Marienthal who, if you must put a face to the voice played Stiffler's younger brother in American Pie, in Cold War era 1958. His mother voiced by Jennifer Aniston, works late shifts at a local diner, his father has been killed (presumably in combat, as we see from a photograph he was a fighter pilot) and Hogarth who has been moved up a grade, finds himself lonely and misunderstood.On a stormy night, a mysterious object crashes off the coast, which to Hogarth's surprise (and everyone's for that matter) is a giant metal eating robot. Finding the creature to be as harmless and confused as a young boy, he befriends the behemoth, stashing him away in a local scrap yard, who the owner (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.) is not especially pleased about. After the giants shenanigans begin to be noticed, a federal agent, brilliantly voiced by Christopher McDonald, comes to investigate ands comes to suspect Hogarth may know something.The scenes where Hogarth attempts to hide the creature are the most hilarious, one sequence after the giant loses his hand (which can walk on its own once severed) our young protagonist attempts to sneak it out of the house. But don't be fooled, the iron Giant is less comedy then it is bold statement, but don't let this turn you off either.Bird's piece is riddled with political commentary on the Cold War and its effect on America and the society's obsession with warfare, weapons and at what cost freedom can be obtained, issues such as morality and death, and explores the human gift of free will, as both a blessing and as a means to do harm. The Giant, despite having every few lines is surprisingly layered and human, and has an innocence covering an inner evil turmoil. The message that you are who you chose to be is reminiscent throughout the whole film, but it never for a second feels preachy. The climax is a thrilling as any action picture, which I will say may be slightly too violent for younger children, and the closing act is as touching as any committed to celluloid.The Iron Giant is a dazzling tale and complex experience which is bound to keep you involved, entertained and will give you something to think about after leaving the theatre. Ranking as one of the best films of 1999, if The Iron Giant marks the end of the reign of the traditional animation style, I say that no finer adieu could be given in this world, or any, dare I say it, beyond this Earth.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",The Iron Giant
114,cLoNe,A giant classic!,10,22 June 2001,The Iron Giant is a fantastic animated classic.The story has a big heart with wonderful characters. The friendship between the kid and the robot is handled perfectly.  The clever combination of smooth 2D animation with 3D animation create an attractive world of fantasy. The attention to detail is impressive and is why this movie is so engrossing.The heart of the movie is covered with enough muscles: many genuinely hilarious moments and a climatic action packed finale.A fantastic must-see must-own movie. There's nothing out there like the Iron Giant.--MB,The Iron Giant

117,maxmages,Definitely one of the best animated films I've seen in my life.,7,13 June 2018,"I was quite young when I saw him for the first time and I have to admit I was thrilled from the first second.
I was very young when I saw the movie for the first time and I have to admit that I probably did not understand half of it. Because some things simply fly over the heads of the youth that's why it's so much fun to watch such films again a few years later when you can enjoy them again with a completely different look, but it was still presented interesting enough that he aroused the interest of one.
(PS: For a change we have a movie without a villain but just people with different opinions and views) I'm pretty impressed with love, music and animation. I do not think it's too bad that we have too much 3D animation movies but most movies and I mean films in general are bland and they're just too different.
This topic already looks like a lost art because such films are no longer made these days.
If you made a live-action movie out of it then only Steven Spielberg would have the talent and experience to get close to this result. With a ""PG-13""? I'm not 100% sure because we know that Spielberg can also press on the violence Tube, when I think of the scenes in which the robot goes rampage, I wonder if Spielberg would hold back nowadays.Brad Bird is just an artist and a genius. Not only do we have a movie with a realistic kids character that is not a bit annoying, but we have real family drama but not the embarrassing way of today's reality TV of all Kardashian scrap, proper social criticism but the message of the movie is not going to be that extreme beaten whit a Sledgehammer so that it is the movie enjoyment in the way. And I was fascinated as a little boy by the mother (Annie Hugher).
As a child, I have seen very few animated films because I find them just too childish, uninteresting and too good. Besides, the constant musical numbers just annoyed me. Thankfully, this movie has none of this * and I love it *.
(Of course not every movie needs sex, violence and cussing
but not every movie has to be like a fairy tale)I have never had to cry at a movie, but this is one of the few movies where not much is missing to open my locks.However, my heart always is.This is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen in my life.
Unfortunately, he is a dying race, both in terms of style and genre, one more reason to keep the movie in his honor and show it to as many people as possible.I thank you for your criticism and your super interesting videos quieter more often videos about movies from the nostalgia department I'm curious what other people say about it and if maybe there is not one or the other movie of which I have not heard.",The Iron Giant
118,Kai-18,The Gun who chose not to be,10,28 November 1999,"One of the most brilliant animated films EVER.  I pray that WB makes more films like this and not like Quest for Camelot (ugh).  It's probably the only animated film in a long time in which I shed a tear.  Disney should make more films like this.  A good animated movie doesn't have to be musical.  This one is clever, beautifully animated and was pulled off quite well.  This should win an Academy award.  I just can't believe good films like this don't do well in the theater.  I hope it does well on video (like the Nightmare before Christmas).",The Iron Giant
119,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Brilliant animated feature, easily one of the best animated films of the 1990's",9,14 August 2005,"The Iron Giant is one of the best animated films of the 1990's. It has everything you could ask for in a movie and it covers some great topics. It covers topics such as cold war tensions, childhood, and it even has an underlying message about anti violence and being yourself. The story follows a gentle robotic giant who befriends a young boy. The giant has no recollection of his origin, or what he was designed for, but the young boy, Hogarth Hughes, tries to teach him about things, similar to how a parent teaches a little kid. At the same time, Hogarth also tries to hide the Giant and protect him from anyone who wants to destroy him. Unfortunately, not everything is well. A shady government agent is bent on trying to find the giant at all costs. The animation is very colorful and very well drawn. The voice talents are all very good. What's interesting to me is how Vin Diesel, who later went on to be in action movies like Fast and the Furious and xXx, was the voice of The Iron Giant before all of that. This movie has a great story, and there is a good message underneath it all. Kids should definitely see this, and adults should too. Even though it looks like a kids movie, adults will be able to get something out of it and enjoy it as well. Another thing this movie pulls off that many cartoons are unable to is to make you feel certain ways. When Hogarth and the giant are playing around and doing fun things, it puts you in a good mood. Later in the movie, when certain things happen to certain characters, you feel the way they feel.Director Brad Bird later went on to make the excellent animated movie, The Incredibles. He has made some good movies, so I hope he can make even more good movies.The Iron Giant is a brilliant animated movie, and as I said before, it has great animation and a great story, along with memorable characters, and a great underlying message. This is easily one of the best animated movies of the 1990's, and it has great elements. There is humor, but smart humor, not mindless fart jokes. There is never a dull moment, or a dumb moment. At certain points, there is action. Normally action at the end of a movie makes it that much more entertaining. It's very rare when you find a cartoon with all of these elements, and when everything works out perfectly. I recommend this for anyone, kids or adults, even teenagers.",The Iron Giant
120,Don-102,An Absolute Wonder Which Cherishes Its Influences - The Best Animated Feature Ever !,10,22 January 2000,"Animated movies have long been considered strictly for children.  The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids, but are still very watchable, even for adults.  With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics,  animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention.  THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece.  The 87 minute wonder is, to put it mildly, incredible. Everything about it is good.  I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.This is a movie with a heart the size of the title character.  A gentle, gigantic robot is rocketed to earth and befriends a 10 year old boy.  The kid has a single mother (voiced nicely by Jennifer Aniston) and he is just looking for a friend, whether it be a squirrel, or even a 50 foot tall machine.  The familiar premise is obviously out of Spielberg's E.T.  One scene even has the giant reaching out his finger to the boy in much the same way ET did to 10 year old Elliott when he departed this earth.  E.T. was an out of this world fantasy that took place on this earth.  Here, it is animated and almost just as effective.IRON GIANT takes place during 1957 in a small town in Maine.  The 1950's was a time when the American public was fearful of atomic bombs and the possibility of alien life off the earth.  Live-action sci-fi films of the 1950's always depicted the arrival of ""dangerous"" alien life and our efforts to destroy it.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is an influence on this film for evident reasons.  Ultimately, the characters in that classic learn from the extra-terrestrial being and realize the dangers of the A-Bomb.  It is amazing to see an animated feature which can relay this same type of message some 50 years later.A beautiful and touching ode to BAMBI is witnessed about halfway through. It also brings back some tearful moments from the key scene in that great, hand-drawn film.  Here, we see both hand-drawn imagery coupled with a computer-generated ""iron giant"".  The title character is actually a 3D composition done digitally, mixed with the 2D action surrounding him.  There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment.  At one point, he appears to be a lighthouse until the lights begin to blink.  I guess robots must blink too.  Enough analysis.  I loved this movie.  It is ranked #81 on the top list by other user authors for a reason.  Not only is it escapist, fantastic entertainment for kids, adults, and seniors alike, it is an animated picture like no other.  It combines the joy of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO, the commentary of 1950's science fiction, and the wizardry and laughter of TOY STORY and its sequel.  Do not miss this enchanting flick.RATING: ****",The Iron Giant
121,datautisticgamer-74853,Could a better non-Disney 2D/CGI mix movie exist?,10,5 August 2016,"After seeing The Iron Giant, I have one more reminder of why I LOVE Brad Bird, as if The Incredibles and Ratatouille weren't enough. The story provides a lot of realism that stays true to its time period, such as the scares of enemy spies everywhere, provides an abundance of small laughs (including some of the best executed juvenile humor I have seen), and has a real weighty moment as well that had me in tears for 3 minutes after the movie ended. The animation is indescribable, but I'm just going to say that it borders on indisputable timeless with its effects and how the 3D mixes in with the 2D. Each of the important characters are hilarious, menacing, or a combination, and even the recurring ones are more than just tolerable. And to think that in 1999, so many people ignored this masterpiece in favor of lesser animated movies of that year, such as Tarzan and Toy Story 2. If there is a non-Disney animated film that you must see before you die, this should very easily be the one.",The Iron Giant
122,T-ZER0,There's so many words I can use to describe this film!,10,13 April 2019,"Outstanding, colorful, emotional, moving and fantastic. Those are just a few of the words I can use to describe Brad Bird's Iron Giant Movie. This man clearly has a knack for making movies. Let's start off with the first thing::CASTING- The casting on this film is so great you can picture these voice actors doing a live-action interpretation of this film.ANIMATION- A unique style of animation that gives realism and quality.HUMOR- Brad Bird is good at this. Kent Mansley is the type of villain you dislike, but love to make fun of, especially when he is on his craziest moments.And Lastly:CHARACTERS- The Iron Giant himself is a very emotional and well written character, Hogarth is a likeable protagonist and you feel for them both when they are in danger or apart.I remember seeing the Iron Giant on VHS. And loving it, now that VHS is long past, I've purchased it on Blu-Ray and love the signature edition of the film. If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing a great deal. Watch it, I guarantee you that you will have a good time.",The Iron Giant
123,moviemattb,Brad Bird's Greatest Achievement,10,24 August 2015,"I have seen many promos with this movie on television, and was curious to see it. Sadly, I didn't, so I guess you can say that I was lazy for not seeing it. No matter, I did see this on HBO and watch this many times as it aired as a 24 hour marathon on Cartoon Network when Warner Bros and Cartoon Network were promoting ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" with a music video during the end credits of ""The Iron Giant."" The movie itself feels timeless, and I know this movie will continue to find an audience despite of its failure at the box office when it first came out in theaters. I am more than happy that this movie has a cult following, and there many fans that are embracing it. With that said, ""The Iron Giant"" its about a boy named Hogarth Hughes who lives with his mother Annie a waitress has discovered a giant metallic robot, who fell from space and befriends him. A beatnik artist Dean McCoppin looks out for the Giant at a junkyard, but federal agent Kent Mansley wants to find the Giant and destroy it. The movie is itself is like Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,"" but it acts very much its own movie. I continue to love this movie as I watch it, and I see nothing wrong about it. The movie does look gorgeous in widescreen as it gives it a much epic feel to it in a CinemaScope format. As much as we love animated movies in CGI like Pixar or DreamWorks, but I do think its beautiful to see an animated movie to be all done traditionally by hand instead of having it all done by a computer. The animation is again beautiful with all the rich colors, and details that were all put into this movie. I do love how the movie looks as the movie takes place in 1957. The movie does have some funny moments, and I guess a bit edgy for an animated movie that features some curse words. The movie is made for kids, but its something that adults would enjoy. Hey, when I first saw this movie, I didn't expect to hear any curse words in an animated movie which I thought it was going to be a clean animated movie like what Disney did with their animated movies. I guess both Bird and Warner Bros. want it to take it up a notch. The movie is rated PG, and nothing to be worrying about. Or shocking for that matter. I do love the characters, and really love the way they're designed. Also, I thought it had great voice acting. Jennifer Aniston; Harry Connick, Jr.; Eli Marienthal and Christopher McDonald were all really good for their own roles. Vin Diesel, I thought, was perfectly cast for voicing the Iron Giant, and can't imagine any one voicing it aside from Diesel. Michael Kamen's score to the movie is very good, and nothing more that I can say about. I love its story and the direction that the filmmakers went, and I think its perfectly executed. This is Brad Bird's greatest achievement, and should be given a lot of credit for making this wonderful movie. I have heard that Bird and Warner Bros. are both working on bringing this movie for a limited release this year on September the 30th, and October the 4th for remastering it and presenting two new scenes for the movie. This new cut will be called ""The Iron Giant: Signature Edition."" I am very excited about it, and would love to see this on the big screen like I never had before. I love ""The Iron Giant,"" and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10.",The Iron Giant
124,Criticman12,An underrated classic from W.B. Animation and Brad Bird,10,17 April 2011,"W.B.

But they did make three classics, the first one was, ""Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm"", the second one was, ""Cat's Don't Dance"", and the third one was, ""The Iron Giant"".The plot is just like, ""E.T."", except instead of an alien, it's a giant robot from Outer Space voiced by Vin Diesel. What I love about this movie is that it has great animation, some funny moments, the voice acting was good, and the movie also has some nice references to the Cold War.There's nothing else to say about this film.

126,joshuafagan-64214,Beautiful and Delightful,9,19 October 2015,"Now first off, I must set the table before we can dig into the meat of this review. This movie was not made by the likes of Disney Animation or their then-fledgling affiliate and now property, Pixar. It was made by Warner Bros. Now, in the 90s, particularly the late nineties, there were a rush of animated movies not made by Disney or any real animation company that won't happen again. It was an interesting time for animation. Not a good one, perhaps; other than this film, the best of these so-called second-string animated movies (not counting TNBC, which is stop-motion) by common judgement is Anastasia, a movie that I professionally dislike and personally despise. But an interesting one.This movie is a great example of why it never happened again. Here is one of the best movies of the year in a year that was filled with great movies, and yet it completely flopped at the box office due to legitimately horrible management by Warner Bros. Seriously; this movie was not relatively expensive (though it looks the part), and it has a very marketable premise. How do you screw that up? That's not rhetorical; I'm confounded. Yes, I'm aware Warner has a history in animation. But that's mostly in television; they should leave movies to the experts.Wow that was long-winded. Thankfully, this movie is not; at only eighty-six minutes, it flies by. You often want it to stay longer; not because it does anything incorrect, but because you don't want it to leave you. This is the kind of film where, if I saw it at the cinema, I would stay during the credits and afterwards. I would stay until they forced me to get out; that's the sort of film it is.If the animation is not as well-funded as Disney's, it does not show it. There are ambitious scenes in this film, scenes that seem to be the lovechild of 70s Disney, 80s Ghibli, and 00s Pixar. You can't honestly say that Tarzan looks like it has more money poured into it than this movie. The motion is especially eye-catching. Speed is one of the hardest things to get right, really right in animation. And yet when it is done right, there is nothing on planet Earth that looks prettier.Miyazaki is the best at this; the first time I watched a scene in the third act of Porco Rosso, one where Porco flies his plane for one last long sequence over the land and to the sea, to meet his final challenge, my life was forever changed. I'm not exaggerating; those were some of the most invocative, most profound minutes of my life. But Bird clearly takes cues from, and shares interests with, Mr. Miyazaki. It does not surprise me that the two of them are friends. And of course, thanks to him helping bring Miyazaki's works over to the West, I'm glad they are.This is a movie that gets darker as it goes along, but it does it in a smart way, a sensible way. And a way that can still get a kid-friendly rating. When I first-watched this movie, the first thing I thought of was eighties Spielberg (though without some of the sappiness.) If this isn't already, (I don't know) it should be one of those films that is in everyone's house, along with Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, Totoro, Finding Nemo, Kiki's Delivery Service, etc. Kids deserve to have this movie be a part of their childhood. If I have kids, I'm showing them this.And of course, it is a gift to us adults as well, whether or not we believe that we deserve it. After the first ten minutes, the transition from 2D to 3D, doesn't feel weird at all. Even more, it feels magical, like it were conjured out of some fantasy world that we only by chance get to see. The writing is stellar and shows a lot of that quick wit that would latter become a staple of his. You get a lot of great lines without the sense that they're trying too hard like you do in The Avengers.I wouldn't say the music is spectacular aside from a few pieces, but it does fit the tone of the film well. The same is true to some extent with the characters, who are my one grievance with the film. They feel too cliché and used. The good acting, particularly from the stars, Connick and Aniston, helps, but overall, he doesn't play enough with the characters. That's the main reason this film isn't as good as The Incredibles and one of the reasons why it isn't as good as Ratatouille (which also could have used stronger characters (except Ego, who was brilliant) but it is not as big of a problem and the rest of the movie is ambient enough to cover for it). And it's the reason I would give this film a 4.5 out of 5.But that's just me comparing Bird to the ridiculously high standards he has set for himself with his era-defining work. I will go as far as to say this is the best American animated film of the late nineteen-nineties not including the Toy Story movies. Better than Hercules or Mulan or Hunchback. It's a whimsical film, it's arguably the essential 'Boy and His X' film, and it is a film with something to say. If this was made after 9/11, it would be the essential post-9/11 movie. The military are the villains and its clear they are acting out of misery instead of 'For the Evulz.' But above all this, I say that I look forward to watching it again. And I believe that's one of the endorsements I can give to a film.And remember: sentient robots are not guns.(P.S. This movie takes place in Bird's birth year, 1957)",The Iron Giant

129,smashattack,Nicely done.,7,8 September 2002,"Spoilers.The Iron Giant is a very interesting movie from the opening scene to the final conflict.  At first I was skeptical after seeing the strange character design and some childish events.But I was impressed with some of the ideas presented in the movie.  The Iron Giant, really a child at heart, is a pretty cool character.  His CGI doesn't fit too well with the other animated scenery, but still interacts rather well.What I didn't like about Iron Giant was some of the ""perfect events"" that seem to plague today's movies.  For instance, a switch on a power plant to turn it on or off?  Come on!  And Hogarth's mother finds the flashlight within seconds of the power going off!  I found things like these kind of annoying.The final climactic moment seems a little out-of-place, since the movie was filled with heart all the way through.  Then the end is filled with military bombardment and attacks, which I found strange.  This action at the end is really cool, however, and I really liked it.Also, I found the ending only partially satisfying.  The movie breaks the traditional ""happy ending"" that American movies constantly have nowadays. The Giant's final sacrifice is amazing.  Here he was, a defensive device with the ability to take out the world if necessary, yet he jumped skyward and into a massive missile to save the inhabitants of a small town.  He isn't really killed, as we find in the end, but I kind of liked this, too, since at the beginning we found out that he was made to fall apart rather than shatter.The plot and story are simple.  Young boy finds giant robot, struggles to keep him out of sight.  Which proves to be obviously difficult and leads to some hilarious twists and turns.The Iron Giant is a really good movie, and I now have a little more respect for Warner Bros.  They've got an adult mindset for a movie that could have been advertised for children.  That seems to happen a lot now.  And it's annoying.  But Iron Giant didn't do this.  It was advertised and made for everybody.",The Iron Giant

It beats the usual cliche stuff churned out by Disney Inc., and the characters are lovable without being overly cutesy. I decided to check out Atlantis as well, and The Iron Giant is far superior to that humdrum, boring Disney flick! The Iron Giant himself has the sweetest personality.

""Iron Giant"" is one of the the most intelligent, touching, feel-good animated films to come out in a LONG time.  For that matter, why didn't anyone see this film last Summer?  A wonderful story with a great voice cast and entertaining story.  The Giant is simply an amazing character.  Not for his technical gadgets, but for his range of expressions and the ability to become thoroughly engrossed with his adventure.The messages in this film, from the ""Red Scare"" sentiments, to discussing death, freedom to be who you are, and the a little boy's perspective of what a soul is make this deeper than any recent Disney film that comes to mind. The robot's desire to be a hero like Superman really tugged at the old emotions on my part.  The robot, even in his darker moment, was truly an innocent.I hope the low box office sales don't scare Warner Brothers off from trying something like this again.

134,eparazak,Simply a masterpiece.,10,29 June 2017,"The Iron Giant is an animated film directed by Brad Bird. It is about a giant alien robot who landed on earth from outer space in the year 1957 and seems to have gotten amnesia. He meets and befriends a young boy named Hogarth, who shows the robot how to be a good person. While doing so, he must keep the robot safe from the public and especially from the U.S. government who is trying to track down what crashed on the planet.I watched this movie at my local theater this week because it was only two dollars a seat and because I was very curious about this one and I left the theater very satisfied with my experience. I couldn't have liked this movie more if I tried. The critics don't lie with this one, it's a well-written, well-polished animated family masterpiece. It is something that both kids and adults can watch and enjoy wholeheartedly.Staring with the animation, it uses a combination of both traditional animation and computer animation. Almost everything in the movie is traditionally animated and then we have the robot who is, at all times, computer animated. Surprisingly, the animators manage to blend in the robot with its surroundings perfectly. The animation doesn't feel out of place with either the 3D or traditional animation, which is a pretty amazing sight to see.The overall feel to it felt out of the ordinary from what you would find in most modern animated movies outside of Disney and Pixar. I feel like a lot of other companies try too hard to make their animated movies part comedy nowadays. With this movie, there were some funny moments, but they didn't parade the movie entirely. Instead, they're replaced with emotionally swinging, powerful moments that give it a very mature feel. For a family movie, it is quite mature, it's one of those movies that's rated PG for a reason. It delves into some very sensitive topics that were and still are relevant to the movie's time period such as fear and prejudice as well as what could lie beyond our world. To further that it's a more mature film, it does have some adult humor and language.I liked all the characters in the movie. I liked the simple, quirky and lonely boy that was Hogarth. Kent was a menacing, unsettling villain who always kept his watchful eye on the main character as two examples. My favorite character of them all has to be the titular character. He's a simple, yet deep and complex character. I won't go too in-dept on him since it would go into spoiler territory, but we do find out about his complexity much later which changes the mood of the movie.Going blindly into this movie was a decision that I do not regret. The Iron Giant is a must watch for anyone who loves animated, movies or just wants a good movie experience. I don't think I found a single flaw or con with this movie when I watched it, it was an experience that I won't forget.10/10",The Iron Giant
135,Blackace,This Iron Giant Will Touch Your Heart And Move Your Soul,9,21 October 1999,"What a wonderful story this cartoon tells. The Iron Giant tells the tale of a young boy who comes in contact with a Giant Robot from outer space. As the robot is trying to feed himself with powerline girders, he's tangled up in the live wired and unable to escape. The frightened boy (Huglow Hughes) rescues him. What follows from that point is true friendship, lessons of war, anger, parenthood, and the bound between a boy a Giant Robot with incredible capabilities. This movie is great family entertainment and should be seen with your kids or parents. Basing this story in the 1950's was a great idea, since war was just itching to happen and people didn't really have a whole lot back then. A little boy and his Mother just getting by in a small town of Roswell, ME really shows that adventure and the love of life can be found anywhere you go. The seen with the deer dying and the explanation of guns killing people were right on target. Yes, guns don't kill people. People kill people, but with GUNS. The NRA may not like this movie, but the fact that it shows parents and kids alike that guns can cause violence and bad things to happen is perfect in this day in age. The movie isn't very long, but the message it gives is worth the time of seeing it. Rent this movie if you missed it in the theater.",The Iron Giant
136,kill-the-boxtrolls,"Cute, charming and funny",8,22 December 2010,"This film is about a young boy (between the ages of 8-10) who thinks his family is a loner. So... he goes off to do what he wants to do, and suddenly feels something strange. He goes off out of the house in disguise and finds a giant (which happens to be the iron giant) who eats up metal. He then talks to his students about it, his mom, and then sometimes he just wants to teach it some things and make it stay out of the house (to not let his parents know).This movie is slow at first, but then in the middle, it's hilarious. It's really charming and a great reference to Superman. Despite all that action, language and angst, young children would enjoy it too. While the movie is endearing, beautiful enough for adults and is as entertaining and funny as it is to kids, this Sci-Fi adventure filled with angst, spies, film noir and detective themes is a joy to all ages!",The Iron Giant
137,timothyhilditch,Last of the cold war movies,7,25 September 2021,"This is a small US town 1950s movie very much like a Stephen King plot with cold war tensions thrown in. Overall good mix of 2D and 3D animation which was rare for the time. Solid plot and writing.If you have watched Lilo and Stitch it has very similar vibes apart from setting it in the past. Other kids movies use the same themes such as how to train your dragon and pete's dragon, drawing it all the way back to ET.",The Iron Giant
138,Jeremy Bristol,Really good retro-style animated film.,8,5 June 2001,"The reviewer from my college paper (whose favorite movie is supposedly Natural Born Killers) considers this the best animated movie ever, over anything by Disney or Hayao Miyazaki and apparently over anything by Ralph Bakshi--the same sort of superlatives that have been lavished on Shrek by young and false animation buffs simply because the movie is ""hip"" and irreverent.  The heart of animation is not cheekiness--it is a stylized reality, something we are in danger of losing with the current trend of photo-realistic computer animation and digital ""film"" (though the Final Fantasy trailers show that there are some in the CGI field that still believe in creating fantastic shots, even if the early dialogue screams Titan A.E.).This is not a problem in The Iron Giant, because the filmmakers only draw the giant (and other rotoscoped objects) on computers, then literally paint them (a la ""The Great Mouse Detective""'s Big Ben scene). The effect is that the computer animation blends well with the traditional cel animation, leaving us in peace to enjoy the beautiful retro-style animation.  Even more important, the story (even with its obvious reference to the X-Files in the form of Kent) stays true to the time they are in, unlike most Disney pictures these days.  This does seemingly make the movie drag, but we are compensated with an atmosphere almost completely devoid of cynicism and mean-spirited irony. This is as close to the feelings of wonder and innocence evoked in E.T. that we are likely to get in animation--save for My Neighbor Totoro, which might be a little too innocent.The only real problems I have with this movie are some glaring and unforgivable continuity errors, exemplified by the filmmakers indecision as to what season the movie should take place in (the movie takes place in less than a week, but we see Hogarth diving into a(n admittedly cold) pond in one scene, then later there is a snowstorm).",The Iron Giant
139,KIDOLOHKEN,There are too many similar works,8,31 January 2020,"Replaced the basic Steven Spielberg ET with a robot. The movie fans of the past may not have felt so good looking at this movie just like me. Or you may have been impressed to think that ET was remodeled like this. Or maybe you didn't notice anything. Also, when I was a child, I watched a special-effects robot hero called ""Majin Bander"". Last was the same. The part that the child works on the bed feels like I have watched about 100 times in a movie. I would like the writers to think a little about these places themself and try to devise rare ideas. It was like a movie made up of episodes of past movies.
The story composition was good. The sequence that robot and the boy talked was pulled as much as possible and the action came at the end. I have to praise that place. When I thought about it, I found out that this writer has written the 'incredible family' and is currently very successful in Hollywood. It is said that his annual income is over $ 6 million. That's fine. I wrote something a bit tough, but in modern times it is inevitable to resemble other works. This is a good film.",The Iron Giant
140,gentendo,Hogarth as Protagonist,8,20 September 2008,"In The Iron Giant, I would argue that Hogarth is the protagonist of the film. Simply put, his enacted choices are what drive the plot and develop the overarching themehence the film's dictum, ""Your choices make who you are."" He is introduced to the viewer as an adventurous young boy who relishes at the chance of having a close friendship, even while at the cost of driving his hardworking mother bonkers (like when he chooses to befriend a squirrel).His main objective is to satisfy his need for friendship. The inciting incident that leads him on this journey is when his television short circuits and interrupts his horror film. Committed to find the fiend who stole, or should we say, ate his antenna wire, Hogarth plunges into the forest and discovers the iron giant. When he makes the conscious choice to save the robots life after seeing him entangled in a web of electrical power lines, it is here, whether he realizes it or not, that his once balanced life becomes unbalanced. After all, to befriend the giant is to introduce a heavy weight, both physically and metaphorically, into his life; thus tipping the balancing scale. Hogarth, however, is up for the challenge. His thirst for friendship surpasses the weight of any obstacle that might thwart this desire of his. Soon the giant begins to follow him where ever he goes. Hogarth is now faced with an enormous obstacleto hide the giant while protecting him from a paranoid government detective. One obstacle after the next, a special bond is created between Hogarth and the giant; one that truly exemplifies the meaning of the word 'friendship.' With Hogarth's continual choice to befriend the giant, the plot is further developed and the audience learns that the giant is much like Hogarth himselfone who has a soul that feels and thinks. This significant plot point may have never been revealed unless there was a character like Hogarth who extended an unprejudiced love towards the gianta love that seemed to lack in the rest of the city because of their fear of 'otherness.' The audience also learns that the giant is a volitional being who can choose whether to be good like superman, or bad like Atomo. This is revealed, once again, because of Hogarth. With Hogarth's help, the giant learns not to act like a weapon of destruction, but rather as a friend to mankind. This idea is particularly emphasized at the crisis/climax of the film. As Hogarth had originally sacrificed the safety of his life when saving the giant, the giant now returns the favor at the end of the film by sacrificing his life to save both Hogarth and the rest of the city. This you could say is the film's meatball criticism: one who lays down his life for the life of his friend is truly a friend indeed. True friendship is found in sacrifice, not selfishness, be it ever great or small. Is Hogarth's objective obtained? I would say yes, for it is the robot's memory that will forever live in his mind as the best friend he ever had.",The Iron Giant
141,Juni78ukr,"Quite simply, this is the best non-Disney animated movie.",10,27 October 2004,"I'm so glad that I finally found this masterpiece five year after this movie has been released. This is a really great movie and in my opinion it's one of the best animated movies ever made. I think the biggest flaw of the Disney animation is the complete lack of human characters. Disney and now Dreamworks made movies about fishes, sharks, bears, lions, dogs, bugs, ants, toys, superheroes and many other animals and creatures but you can hardly find single movie with human character from a real life . Well, all their characters can talk, feel and behave like humans but it is not the same. Most of their recent movies were good, funny and entertained but at the same time they look a bit childish and not so emotional, even cold. They are typical commercial stuff and with strong marketing studios often get good box office returns. The Iron Giant is a different case. This is a very intelligent, good-feeling and enjoyable animation with powerful and clever moral messages in its core. At first sight it looks like a kids movie but it's a wonderful movie both for kids and adults. In fact the movie idea could have been unnoticed for small kids. The story happens in 1957 in small town in Maine. It was a years of the cold war and military paranoia, a period of total fear and misunderstanding from both sides. It was really amazing to watch how brilliant was recreated the atmosphere of that period. All begins than the Hogarth, a young fatherless lonely boy found near his home mysterious Iron Giant. I think it was s a clever idea what we'll never know where this giant come from. Different and unknown doesn't always mean bad and enemy. Hogarth helped him and they become friends. He gave Iron Giant some moral lessons and even taught a basic English. But when in the town comes paranoiac special agent Kent Mansley they friendship now is in a danger. He wants to kill the Giant without any reasonable reason, just because he think what this strange robotic Iron Giant can be dangerous. Most surprising and intelligent element in the story was the fact that this movie didn't become a cheesy childish anti-gun propaganda. The message is more wise and intellectual. As Hogarth said we are what you we choose to be. Our acts are always our individual decisions and some things can't be simply bad or good, and only our choice can decide how we can use them. Also you can find in this movie many other strong philosophical ideas and thoughts. Overall, the story of friendship between young boy and The Iron Giant is very touching and emotional. Now about animation. It was absolutely fabulous. All movie is an amazing work of art. The Hogarth character so perfectly drown that you can easily forget that it's an animated movie. He looks like a real, well acted boy. I have seen almost all famous animated movies and I suppose he is a best animated character I have ever seen. The rest of main characters also very impressive, landscapes, sky and all minor details like ships and tanks were beautiful and looked absolutely real. The Iron Giant was the only computer-generated character and he didn't look as a soulless machine. He becomes a very warm and likable character. With excellent characters development and interesting story The Iron Giant is an extraordinary intelligent movie. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's sad but it's always enjoyable, touching and entertained movie. If you haven't seen it before just go and buy, rent or borrow it. I recommend The Iron Giant to all people irrespective of their age. A solid ten. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.",The Iron Giant
142,slayerjmk95,Best Animated Film of All Time,10,1 December 2011,"I watch almost any kind of movie, and when it comes to animated features, they have to be truly heart-warming to capture the real spirit of a family film. There have been plenty throughout the years that deserve immediate and all time praise; Toy Story (1, 2 and 3), How to Train Your Dragon, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, Shrek, Wall-E, and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (underrated Dreamworks cartoon). But no cartoon deserves more praise and acknowledgment than Brad Bird's The Iron Giant.The Iron Giant is set in 1957 and stars Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant, an alien machine that crash-lands on Earth and is soon befriended by a little boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal), who discovers that ""Giant"", as Hogarth calls him, eats metal for food. Not long after all this, a government agent (Christopher McDonald) arrives and begins to cause trouble, and soon chaos as he believes Giant to be a foreign weapon sent to destroy America. I have never seen anything like this movie before; constantly heart-warming, family-fun comedy moments (which are great), and an emotionally shattering climax that is truly memorable. If you really love to watch movie and, not only be entertained, but moved, then The Iron Giant is one you have to watch. I would also have to say, Warner Bros. should be ashamed for the bad marketing they did for this movie; just like Brad Bird said, ""They had no idea what they had in their hands."" This should have won a few Oscars and Golden Globes; it deserves it. 10/10 Stars***",The Iron Giant

145,Nigel St. Buggering,Another ignored classic,10,2 November 2003,"One of the most frustrating things about Disney's stranglehold on the animation industry is that when a truly great animated film does come along, fans ignore it in droves. Such a case is The Iron Giant. Many people are blaming its poor showing on Warner Bros lack of advertising, which is ridiculous. I dislike the idea that unless we're inundated with Happy Meal tie-ins and action figures, the film is under-advertised. There certainly was adequate advertising for this film; it simply wasn't in titanic Disney proportions.The Iron Giant is, no exaggeration, one of the best animated films of the last ten years. As a childhood fable, as a view of fifties foreign paranoia, as a statement on violence, it works perfectly. There isn't a single flawed scene from beginning to end. And it proves conclusively that animation can work without cute animal sidekicks or overwrought musical numbers; just a great story, brilliantly timed comedy, and some truly touching moments.The combination of cel animation and computer imagery is seamless, with each technique used to its best effect. The voice-acting is top-notch, with Christopher MacDonald particularly good as the paranoid government agent. Having not read the book myself, I can't vouch for the film's adherence to the original story, but I highly recommend it to any lover of animation.Incidentally, lest you think it's purely for children, I watched it with a group of men over thirty, and we all loved it.

I can't explain it, but there was this overwhelming feeling of nostalgia as I watched it. It left me with this bittersweet feeling. I felt loss and sorrow, but it wasn't a negative feeling. It was like having touched the most fragile parts of humanity and realizing those were your parts. I think the feelings were amplified for the time period than the actual content of the movie. It's funny since my parents were just born in the 40s and I wasn't even around. I thought the most touching part was the homage to superman. I thought it was interesting that this alien's desire to emulate a fictional alien made him more human. It was because Superman has always embodied all the very traits that as humans we strive to posess. His desire to be like Superman meant he yearned to be good, although programmed only to do harm. The animation was beautiful. I am really leary of people who didn't understand or enjoy this film.",The Iron Giant
149,bhicks56,What a joy,10,14 December 1999,"It's such a relief to see an animated film that goes against the annoying elements of Disney: the Broadway music and songs, the irritating comic sidekicks, the heavy-handed morals. It's become such a cliche that kids aren't being entertained like they used to (don't fear TARZAN, though, a wonderful movie).I knew I was going to enjoy this movie's retro 50s-like animation immensely, but I was surprised how much more I enjoyed. The movie isn't concerned how life-like the characters are, because ultimately it's the actions that make them more realistic than how they appear.Eli Marienthal's voice is incredibly convincing as the young boy Hogarth and the title robot is the most enjoyable and friendly creature to watch since E.T. almost twenty years ago. The Iron Giant is voiced with mechanical authenticity by Vin Diesel who marvelously makes the audience not only believe but love and sympathize for this colossal metal man. There are also good (voice)performances by Harry Connick Jr. (who sounds like a cajun Bruce Willis here) and Christopher McDonald (who I was convinced was Tim Allen). One of the great moments are when Hogarth teaches his new mechanical buddy about Superman, and the Iron Giant decides he wants to be a hero.It is almost inevitable for a movie like this not to have a message, but the great thing is that not only is it a good and heartwarming message, but it isn't handed to us in a heavy and literal way. Guns are bad and they are only used for killing. Near the end I almost felt ashamed that I was starting to get a bit misty.

153,Euphorbia,Morally flawed masterpiece,8,17 October 2002,"This is a great animated movie, certainly the best I have seen. The animation, a nearly seamless mix of traditional drawn cels with a 3D CG creature, is first rate. But what really shines is the story. The writing is sharp, and so are the voiced performances. But I give Iron Giant an 8, rather than a 10, for two reasons.
First, beginning with the 'Bambi' scene, the last third of the movie is stained by typical Hollywood politically-correct bigotry. This was entirely unnecessary to the story. Why the film makers chose to deface their own creation this way is their business, but it angered me. Maybe they were betting that most viewers are too naive or too stupid to notice a little gratuitous hate-mongering. Maybe it was a condition of their getting funded by a big Hollywood studio. Maybe it was an element of the original book (which I have not read), but if so, it should have been changed to fit the rest of the movie, rather than being left in place to scar it.
Possible SPOILER follows... Second, at the climax, there is a hole in the logic of the plot large enough to fly a phalanx of iron giants through. I refer to the way the giant chooses to deal with the [seriously anachronistic] missile warhead, given the capabilities he has demonstrated moments before. Are we supposed to believe that this earnest good-hearted giant has been miraculously transformed into a weepy-eyed Hollywood parlor pink? I don't think I can willingly suspend that much disbelief.

The soundtrack is also a treat, with the first half of the movie filled with classic 1950's radio hits, and the last half with menacing sci fi thriller tones that leave you on the edge of your seat.The movie is full of fun developments, like when the child-like giant robot begins to see itself as a copy of Superman after Hogarth reads it comic books in the barn. The robot's true nature however soon becomes apparent when it witnesses hunters shoot and kill a deer, and the automatic programming registers the human guns as a threat.Harry Connic turns in a fantastic performance as the beatnik junkyard collector and artist Dean, and Jennifer Anniston does a fantastic job as Hogarth's overworked but ever doting young mother.",The Iron Giant

So why am I writing one anyway? Because it's the kind of special movie you feel compelled to rave about, no matter how many others have already done so.What Disney has done to animated film the past decade is evil. They've churned out increasingly soulless, formulaic movies that exist solely to bleed every last penny from parents. They take their children to the theater, pick up cheap tie-in toys at the fast food joint, trek to the toy store for more shoddy ancillary crap, and buy the video so their little drones can sledgehammer the pointless sludge that Disney has to gall to call entertainment into their skulls by watching it 72 times. (Not that it bugs me or anything.)Thankfully, ""The Iron Giant"" is the complete opposite of all this. A quiet, touching film filled with delights both large and small, its heart is as big as its brain. It's got a gentle, thoughtful essence that most movies of any kind simply lack.I am late 20s with no kids, and rather cynical (if the Disney rant didn't clue you in). I watched this film with my wife, and we both melted. If you have kids, this is a must-see. Even if you don't, I still recommend it. It's clever, well-written, thought-provoking, and it will resonate with anyone who has a sense of humor and empathy.

As a 31 year old, I still cried when watching the re-release. This is the only animated film that has made me react emotionally. Not even my favorite Disney film Beauty and the Beast made me cry. So for people who dismiss animated films as ""kids stuff"", you are wrong. In my opinion, this is the greatest animated film ever made, and I'm glad that as time has gone on, it status has grown. It under performed back in 1999, due to bad marketing and competing films of the time, but it's now regarded as one of the all-time greatsSimpsons veteran Brad Bird has been one of my favorite directors for a long time, and this, along with Ratatouille is one of my favorites of his films. The film's score is fantastic too. The animation is amazing, the voice acting is brilliant. And I'm a sucker for a film set in the 50s. If I have to pick one thing I didn't like, it was the reinstated dream sequence for the signature edition, where we scenes of his home world.

Intelligent, funny, tragic, and deeply moving, we'd be so lucky to ever see an American animated film strike such chords again. The look of the film is superb, and it's underlying themes and messages resonate even more strongly today. Containing a boldly pacifist theme, the film tells a story of a mechanism of war--meant to destroy--that, through the innocence of a little boy, learns to sacrifice in the name of peace and understanding, as apposed to killing in the name of ownership and power. I hope,as years pass, more and more people come to discover this gem so that they can share their experience with the Iron Giant, as well.",The Iron Giant
162,Blinking_Fish,A refreshing break from the animation mold many of use are used to.,8,7 March 2000,"No show tunes, no side kicks, mild language, Nice break from what has been etched into many of our minds if almost all your viewing of animation if from North America.  Most animated movies that are released here are family viewing aimed more at the children then the adults, enough show tunes and comic relief to keep the kids involved and little enough to keep the adults involved.  I too can enjoy a Disney movie but probably wouldn't be able to sit through a marathon of them.  The Iron Giant was different.  The language was harsher then a lot of cartoons but nothing that wouldn't be aired on TV, this didn't shock me but I watch a lot of animated films where this stuff is nothing compared to what I've heard said in them.  The animation is nice and smooth, and the characters act realistic enough.  Most of the humor wasn't very deep but still made me laugh in many scenes.  One of the things I didn't like about this movie was then fact that the antiwar message was imposed a little to strong around the end.  Also showing that the films that tell you to duck and cover during a nuclear attack will have no chance of protecting you.  Still it's overall a good movie and would recommend it to anyone.My review 8 out of 10.",The Iron Giant

And such original, unexpected characters!! wow!Another common observation is this is not really a children's movie, at least not younger than 10. Some of the scenes are too intense for younger children.The cinematography is very good. The pan scene of New England in the fall is worth the price of the movie, as are the opening scenes.

But it is definitely not as bad as those silly little cartoons.The voice acting is brilliant. Jennifer Aniston was amazing! And I usually hate her. Harry Connick Jr. is clever and sharp, as always. I don't know who did the voice of ""Hogarth"" but that is one amazing little kid. And Vin Diesel as the Iron Giant......oh yeah!!! The story is incredible. And so are the characters. That's why I watched this movie today. I don't like it as much now as I used to. But then, I was obsessed with it years ago. Aside from the animated kids feeling, the movie is brilliant.

Which is a shame, because this is a unique, outstanding movie.Unlike most of the animated films made in the States, TIG relies on characterization rather than on insipid humor(not that there ISN'T humor in it because there is)to propel its story, which in itself is constructed on 50's paranoia,and the damaging effects of fear. I also enjoyed the music by Micheal Kamen,the voice acting(Vin Disel actually has been in a good movie) and the ending, which I will not reveal.With a new DVD release, hopefully ""The Iron Giant"" will get some of the recognition it deserves.",The Iron Giant
167,JolinKnight,"Small animation, Big inspiration.",8,14 June 2013,"Firstly, I want to say this is a beautiful story, a interesting animation, a deep thinking with its lovely dubbing. The outline of this story is clear and ordinary, but it will not let you down at any moment. Due to its almost perfect continuity and obvious but not boring plot, it is easy for children to follow and to wet their eyes, especially when our iron giant said ""Superman"" and then took care the bomb; just like the plot in ""How to Train Your Dragon"" (2010), it is a sacrifice in the end, however, everything will be fine at the final end.Furthermore, with this simple story which is logical but not novel, ""The Iron Giant"" really teaches us something. The unknown things are always considered dangerous and scared, it is absurd and what the author wants to throw down by this film. When Hogarth helped the iron giant to get rid of the electric cable, the next day our giant show him the friendly. ""Him, not it"", said by a little boy shows us a warm world although it is frozen winter in the film. ""He is like a baby"", when he is hungry, he has only iron in his mind, when he find it is interesting to jump into the water, he plays like a children; ""You are not him (the machine killer), you are like superman"", just like teaching a child, good teaching grows up a reasonable boy.Finally, the most worth thinking about is ""guns kill"", is this a enlightenment telling giant you are a gun of killing, wake up, or a word to tell him do not be the gun killing innocence, even though you possess the power. Actually, clues for both of them can be found, but of course, the later one is what the film wants to say.Just an cute animation, too much thinking for it...... LoL!",The Iron Giant
168,MasterFantastic,A boy and his robot,10,14 January 2015,"If you were a young, fatherless boy in the not-so-innocent but still portrayed as the innocent 1950's, and if you found a robot with amnesia that had powers way beyond anything you'd ever dreamed of, then this is the movie for you.With a simple yet prescient message of tolerance for all, The Iron Giant stands metal heads and shoulders above many other animated features as it concentrates on character development as opposed to showing off CGI pyrotechnics.The voice work is excellent, particularly Vin Diesel who manages to inject his character as the Giant with great emotion in only a few simple words. Jennifer Aniston as Annie, Harry Connick, Jr., and Eli Marienthal all portray their parts as people as opposed to just actors reading lines.The animation is fine, although I've seen better, but it captures the period well enough. There are a couple of plot holes--mainly about the Giant managing to keep hidden so well when he is a, well, giant--but the movie is so gripping and the music moving (and a little maudlin at times) that you just can't help getting caught up in it.Highly recommended.",The Iron Giant
169,Dr.Mike,Fine Animation,8,21 August 1999,"The Iron Giant is the best surprise film of the summer.  Intelligent writing, comedy that is actually funny, and a strong message all come together to create a good film experience.  The film loses its way a bit at the end by going a little too over the top with the boy's relationship with the giant, but otherwise it is even-handed and emotionally restrained.The best part of the film is that it is not afraid to state its political beliefs.  The Cold War was a waste of people's lives and times.  The boy is fatherless, in fact, because he was a pilot who died in Korea (we can assume).  The methods that our government provided us for protection were all lies, such as the Duck and Cover film that must be seen to be believed. Best of all, the film is strongly anti-gun.  The giant, like all of us in our insane country, can be a gun.  He chooses not to be and chooses not to hurt others.  It is a choice we can all make by saying no to guns and gun violence.  The military and government officals suffer some well-deserved put-downs, and the hero's friend is a subversive beatnik artist.  What could be better than that?  The real reason that Warner is not promoting this film is that it fears that its strong political message could create a backlash against the company.  Instead, they put their money into Wild Wild West and its humor based on race and disability. Better to reaffirm those who hate than encourage us to love.",The Iron Giant

Do yourself a favor and buy this film when it becomes available. This film deserved a better treatment at the box office.

173,buih-47731,10/10!,9,12 November 2018,"Once in a lifetime you'll come across a film that truly captures the history and cultural distinctions of the modern world the way a person can subjectively perceive it through our guided field of perspective. I have to admit, I had my doubts when I first learned of the movie. After all, The Iron Giant? Will this movie even be good? How ignorant was I to even have these thoughts. Little did I know I was about to indulge in what may have been the best 2 hours and 21 minutes of my life. The movie started out strong. The opening scenes enticed the audience with a captivating enigma. I was so taken aback from the next-generation animation that I almost didn't even realize the underlying symbolism in the ongoing scenes. It wasn't until my twenty sixth viewing of the movie where I finally got my bearings together and was able to focus on the gripping and labyrinthine stratagem. The underlying analogy for 19th century distopianism and the evangelical deviation of typical orthodoxy was enlightening to say the least. Just when I thought the movie could not get any better, the increasing conflict before the climax began. I could not believe the complexity of the story as the main bee protagonist, Bellza, struggled with the everyday endeavors for a quintessential bee such as the consistent up- hill altercation of the fight against misogyny and the fiscal synergy of opposing interplanetary dynamisms. There I was, gripping to my chair as the conflict of the movie began. I was so enticed by the movie that I felt as if I was both practically and relatively apart of the movie. This is a special kind of high that not even the strongest of drugs can give you. Was I part of the movie? Am I inside the movie right now? This movie will leave you questioning existential nihilism and the objective skepticism of our perceived valuation of anthropological existence. At this point in the film, I was fully intoxicated by the avant-garde animated art style. That's when the plot finally aggrandized and I was completely stupefied. You could have lived a thousand years of isolation trying to predict the plot twist and you would never even scratch the surface of what actually transpires in the movie. I was so bewildered that I actually had to pause the movie so that my existential crisis didn't dive too deep inside of myself. Even pausing the movie was surreal. It's almost as if life paused with the movie. I felt as though I had actually become a cinematic tangent quantum. The effects are still wearing off and I haven't been able to watch the movie in several years. I spent the following seven years afraid of what outside of my house actually looks like. Every single day and night I live in misery because I became fully aware that happiness is never achievable. I realized that human life has absolutely no meaning and that no matter what I ever do, it is of complete unimportance and in years from now, no recollection of my existence will prevail, meaning that if I died years ago, died now, or die sometime in the future it will not matter whatsoever to anyone. But, then again, the fact that I'm living doesn't matter either so I might as well stick around for awhile, living in complete isolation, condemned to a life of traumatic memories and a completely corrupted sub-conscience. The Iron Giant literally ruined my life. 10/10",The Iron Giant
174,constructionbob,"Wonderful, amazing movie",10,3 June 2000,"I'm pretty stingy about giving out my 10's on this site, but this movie did get one of them.  It's quite simply that good.  Anyone who misses out on it because it looks like a kiddie cartoon is sadly mistaken, as it features better characters and a more heartfelt story than most any other hollywood movie.  You'll care more about the Giant in the end than any cookie-cutter stereotype in that ""realistic"" movie you were thinking about seeing. 
The parallels to E.T. in the storyline are undeniable, but this film has a philosophical twang to it that in my opinion gives it the edge.  The joy of childhood, the realities of death, the possibility of afterlife, the numbing effects of paranoia-no other film deals with such difficult subjects, and is fun to boot!  Watch it with your kids, or someone you care about.  You'll like it, I think.",The Iron Giant
175,alexdelliott,The best animated film for all ages,9,2 February 2014,"as a twenty-something year old man my favourite films include the likes of Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Seven and I hope soon to see the Wolf of Wall Street. However, I have fond memories of my childhood, the days of Toy Story and Disney Classics. I say this to give context behind me stumbling upon The Iron Giant today on television. I partly remember really liking it as a child so I put it on in the background while I did some work, but within 5 minutes I was completely engrossed as this film is fantastic.This film is about a giant metal robot that arrives on Earth in the 1950s for unknown reasons and a boy who finds him and befriends him. The two form a heart-warming bond as the child tries to protect his new friend from a paranoid government official. This is set against the backdrop of the cold war and the suspicion and fear that came with it. I wont spoil any more but this film is so emotional I'm not ashamed to admit I felt a few tears once or twice. The story is very simplistic yet it touches on a number of ongoing political issues, most importantly that just because we don't understand something, doesn't mean it's a threat.Despite gong into these themes, the film never feel like it's preaching or talking down to the audience, and fortunately it came before the era when everything had to be very PC so don't expect anything like this film to be showing any time soon.To sum up my short review, this film is a must-see even for those who don't like animated films, I don't usually watch them but this is definitely an exception. This is a film to watch with your family on a wet weekend day when you're in the mood for being cosy. I think children will enjoy the aforementioned giant metal robot but the film goes so much deeper than that, making it possibly the best animated family film I've ever seen.",The Iron Giant
176,Stroheim-3,The Best Animated Feature Since Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,10,9 September 1999,"I don't have enough positive things to say about the Iron Giant; I just want to say that right now.  It was a beautiful film that reflects the Communist paranoia of 1950s America through a boy and a metallic alien in rural New England.  This movie is a genuine treat.  It is something that adults can relate to with the myriad of reference to 50s culture, and both children and adults will love its innocence.The film is drawn in a classical animation style like early Disney films to give the audience a feel of the time in which it is set.  Unlike recent Disney films (thankfully), The Iron Giant does not have any cutesy little ""friends"" that serve as comic relief or to create nausea for the viewer. Instead, the filmmaker respects the audience's intelligence (both children and adults) by giving us a simple story that does not rely on embellishment to make itself more viewer friendly.  It doesn't need it.The author started with a concept - what if a gun had a soul? - and created this brilliant animated feature in the same vain of Spielberg's E.T.-The Extra-Terrestrial.  It stands as a testament to what animated films should be (it is possibly the best in over 50 years), but what's more, it stands as a testament to what FILMS should be.  I can't stress this film's greatness.  Just see it for yourself, and be a kid again.",The Iron Giant

It includes some ideas regarding the dangers of guns that must make the NRA (National Rifle Association) furious. But mostly it is about what it means to be a thinking creature, Too bad I can't say more for fear of revealing too much. Great thinking, great images, an amazing rendition of falling snow etc...

179,Theoron,The BEST film of 1999,10,27 December 1999,"I've just watched the DVD version of ""Iron Giant.""   I found the story line to be one of the most cliche' plots in all of animation.   There is an obvious anti-gun message that is rather silly and ineffective.   Then there's the all too familiar ""kid without a father"" theme that Hollywood beats like a dead horse.    Hardly the sort of stuff that makes for a great film.   But, worst of all, it is filled with logical and factual errors that stretch the already thin credibility of animated flicks.Despite all that, I just loved this movie!Of all the films I've seen in 1999, this is definitely the best of the lot-- animated or live action.   And I say this just having seen ""Toy Story 2"" a few weeks back, which is now my second favorite film of '99.  ""Iron Giant"" kicked it out of first place.   (You know it's a bad year for movies when your top two favorites are animations...)   Flaws and all, this film has more heart and emotion than any other 10 Hollywood films of 1999 combined.The film takes place during 1957.  We have a story about a boy named Hogarth (without a father, of course...) who finds a giant iron robot from outer space while searching the woods for invaders from Mars.   After being initially scared to death of the creature, he quickly realizes the robot is not out to harm him- and so, in short order, the boy befriends him.   The rest of the movie deals with the boy's efforts to hide a 100ft. tall robot from the local townspeople of Rockwell, Maine and the United States government.While there's nothing cliche' about a boy taking a walk in the woods and discovering a huge metallic robot suffering from amnesia munching on the local electric power plant, the ""...boy meets awesomely powerful yet benign creature and quickly befriends him while everyone else wants to kill him..."" plot has been done too many times to count.    Yet the film's writers, directors and animators take us down this well-traveled path in such a way that new life is breathed into this most ancient of fairy tales.   For that feat alone, the movie is deserves every drop of praise it gets.The film is a parable of the atomic age.   The fears and paranoias of the time are summed up in the government agent sent out to find the giant robot, ""Kent Mansly.""   He's a walking, talking tribute to the ""red under every bed"" mindset.    The innocent and fun loving target of his paranoia, the boy Hogarth, contrasts Mansly.   Hogarth is about the best portrayal of a red blooded 50's era American boy that's ever been put to screen, despite the fact that he's a simple drawing.""Iron Giant"" should not be mistaken for a mere kid's flick.    Parents will like it as much if not more than their children.   The message of the film is one of love and self-sacrifice, the kind of thing most of us want to instill in our kids.  In it's own way, ""Iron Giant' is a kind of ""Saving Private Ryan"" for children.Ultimately, this is a love story between a boy and his robot.   Yes, it sounds silly, but you'll have to see it yourself to understand how the writers & directors pull it off.  There is a moral to this film, or I should say, ""morals.""  The morals are not heavy handed or preached, but they are expounded upon by the actions of the characters themselves.   My favorite lesson had to do with  ""peace through superior fire power!""But don't take my word for how good it is. My four-year-old son watched the DVD three times in a 24-hour period, and watched it every day we had it for the seven-day rental period.  I believe it's now his new favorite film.  We judge how much he likes a film by the amount of times he asks to see it again.    The last movie he wanted to watch as much as this one is ""A Bug's Life.""Interesting note: ""Iron Giant,"" along with ""Toy Story 2,"" both pay homage to good old ""Sputnik"" -the first ever satellite launched into earth's orbit. It's neat how these two rather unrelated stories both deal with the significance of that event.Don't bother renting this film.   Just buy it the next time you see it on sale.   We've already decided to make the ""Iron Giant"" DVD a permanent part of our collection.",The Iron Giant
180,tweiss1981,"High-art, thy name is Iron Giant",6,15 March 2001,"""The Iron Giant"" had to be the best of the first three WB animated movies. I liked the flawed but enjoyable ""Quest for Camelot"", (hadn't seen the WB animated ""King and I"", was that movie any good?) but ""Iron Giant"" is now the one to best.  The story involves a young boy named Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal) who likes science-fiction, late night movies and MAD magazine, and later, befriends a 100-foot tall, metal munching machine, and needs keep him safe from those may report him.  Meanwhile, Agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) is aware of a giant metal beast and believes it might be a threat (designed by who?  The Chinese?  The Russians?  Martians? Who?)It's not a silly little kids' movie.  It's one the whole family will grow into liking.  Also, I can't picture Disney making this movie, at least, not w/o (some or any of) the following: retro '50's stuff (ie. sock hops), Hogarth wanting to hide the giant and impress a girl he has a crush on, Hogarth having an obligatory comic relief in the form of a pet (his mom doesn't want one) and presence of heart.  All current Disney movies seem to have all of the first three, but none of the last one. 
What angers me, though, is the fact this movie bombed at the box office.  I hate it whenever an animated flick bombs just because it seems like the only reason being is it wasn't made by either Disney or DreamWorks.  Maybe if only a LITTLE bit more advertising was put in...However, I contain boasting rights to this movie.  In August of 1999, I could've been a sucker for hype and Happy Meals.  I COULD'VE seen the snoozefest ""Blair Witch Project"".  I COULD'VE paid for that Happy Meal disaster ""Disney's Inspector Gadget"".  What did I pay for?  WB's ""The Iron Giant"".

182,raptor_2,Not enough films like these.,9,29 August 1999,"There simply aren't enough films (not movie, FILM) like this around today.  Much like this year's other great underdog, the Sixth Sense, the Iron Giant truly comes out of nowhere in a once commercialized or stupidized genre.  And both have similar storylines, namely about a boy who has something very special about him. In the film, young Hogarth Hughes of Rockwell, Maine, finds a giant robot in the woods behind his house.  With the robot apparently having lost his memory from a bump on his head, he befriends young Hogarth....actually, Hogarth befriends him. As most reviews have stated, there are no stupid Disney-used traits at all in this film.  NO dumb sidekicks, no stupid songs, and excellent characters, including the Giant himself.  Hogarth, his mother, and the rest, all feel and act like they should from their respective backgrounds.  So no one here is exceptionally heroic, or sarcastic. I have endless praise for this film.  It is bold and grand in every aspect.  It is my favorite film of all time, tied with the Matrix and South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut. And on one last note, it would be a tragedy if this fine film is overlooked by other underdogs from this year such as the Sixth Sense and....well, so far, these are the only 2 movies this year that I have seen (with the possible exceptions of south park and the matrix) that deserve to be nominated this year.",The Iron Giant
183,Kynde,How can MAN be so cruel. It makes you cry. 10 out of 10!,10,28 January 2000,"A fantastic feeling. How can MAN be so cruel. This movie touched me very deeply, and I can't remember any other movie that made me so angry and sad about the way humans (can) think.
24 years old, it's a cartoon, and it's ""only"" a machine, but at the end when the worst of all things happened I cried like I have never cried during a movie. It has been years since the tears ran like that. I don't think I ever will forget that moment.
I almost missed this movie, because I regarded it as a children's movie, and even though I always go to Disney's cartoon to see the fantastic pictures, this cartoon does not have that kind of drawings. So I was lucky, that so many other liked it, because when I saw that it was in top 100 on IMDb's Top 250 I said to my self: ""Well maybe this is worth watching"", and now you know that I think it was.
Before the terrible moment, there are laughs, excitement and all the other stuff that makes a good movie. I loved the scene with the hunters that shoots a poor deer, and then looks up, sees the Giant, and cries out: ""Oh no, it's the monster"". That's so ironic as can be. I think the movie does a good job; it can be enjoyed both by kids and adults. I have already mentioned why adults would like it, but when I just saw it, the rest of the audience consisted of children with there parent(s). I could here that the children liked it. I don't think they really understood what happened in the worst part, they didn't sound scared.

THE IRON GIANT not only had a positive message, but was funny and heart-warming too. As a guy who is totally at odds with the unduly graphic, formulaic, impersonal and dumbed-down movies of this era, it was a unique experience for me to walk out of a movie feeling good about what I just saw. For example, although FIGHT CLUB (8.5/10) is easily one of the top five movies of the year, I must admit that I did not feel particularly good when I left the theatre that day. Shocked is the word that comes to mind, but ""good"" is not one of them. After thinking over the films I had seen so far this year, not unsurprisingly, almost none of them made me feel good. Oh, I may have been intellectually stimulated, but was I encased in a field of positive energy? No. If you want a big, warm fuzzy, this film, THE IRON GIANT, is certainly the one to watch.8/10",The Iron Giant

It's not like those other cartoon movies like Doug's First Movie or Recess. In the Iron Giant there are some serious parts like when the Iron Giant saves the town (Rockwell, Maine) from a huge missle or when Hogarth saves the Iron Giant from being electricuted. I doesn't seem to be a real kiddy cartoon but at the same time it is funny. Hogarth Hughes is hilarious especially when he put a little something in Kent Mansley Coffee to give him have diarrhea.

187,stuartpiles,The Greatest Animated Film Ever.,10,2 November 2005,"It is amazingly subtle till the last 15 minutes.It changes is pace, tone, and message, almost like Superman changing directions in mid air. Without you knowing it.. Yet, this film stands by itself, as far as I am concerned, as the greatest Animated Film ever..This is written by someone who for more than 50 years has been a fan of animation, of all kinds, from the "" The Sprit Within"" to ""Beauty and the Beast"" to, ""Dumbo"", to ""Robots"", to Triplettes de Belleville, Les, to ""Ice Age; to ""What's Opera Doc"" to ""One Froggy Evening"" to ""Duck Amuck"" to the ""Dot and the Line."" Yes, I have seen hundreds of animated films, short and long..Further, I am not the only one who has said this is the best..Read as many of the reviews as you can..there are at least 10 more (possibly 20) that say that this is the best Animatated film ever, some others say this is among the greatest films ever made. And, it is.Why, because of its tone, message, flow, ease of transition, almost as if you do not notice it. In the end, there is a message, which goes past most, and it took me 3 or 4 showings in the theater, for the light bulb in my head to go on, about what Brad Bird was really trying to say with this filmSnow White, may be considered by some to be better, only because it made others possible, but this is the finest, most sensitive, most dramatic, and the best Full Length Animated Film ever made. For those who read this, and if you haven't seen this, let it hypnotize you, as it did to me..and watch the last 15 minutes a few times...maybe you too will figure it out.......Many years after this was written, I have to add an interpretation of the very end of the film,
that I came to realize only after 4 or 5 viewings in the theater at the time of its release...Yes, I saw it many times, perhaps 7 at the original release because this film is a feel good movie with a great message about violence and war...
.................But at the end....after the explosion, the Iron Giant has been destroyed,...for about ten to fifteen seconds you see the Iron Giant putting
himself back together....Yes, he was destroyed, but you have the Iron Giant's
parts coming back together to live some more...A moment at the end, that many viewers miss. Yes, Iron saved the world from destruction, and died doing so, but at the very end as he puts himself back together and is living again ...(I think that scene takes place in some distant out of the way place)
I got the feeling that the message of this movie is very deep and spiritual..
...........................................................................................................................................
....The Iron Giant is... resurrecting himself at the very end of the film....coming to life again....Just like a great teacher of peace was resurrected after he died on the cross...That the message of the ...Iron Giant... is exactly the same as that
other teacher who died on the cross about 2000 years ago....No difference
in the teaching of the two teachers and believers in peace and helping others through life's most difficult times....That is what I saw at the very end of this wonderful and inspiring film...And it took me at least 4 viewings of the film at the time of its release in the fall of 1999 to understand what the real deep meaning of the movie ""Iron Giant"" was all about...At least that is what I believe to this day that I am writing this in November 2020. The Iron Giant's message about peace, kindness, love and sacrifice is not new at all. Even if Iron Giant came from another world to tell us this message..That message had been told before by other great teachers and no doubt will be told again and again...And you know maybe that message needs to be told over and over again...Many humans on this planet Earth need to hear this message more than once around this time of the year..We need to hear this message again, and again and again because it is a great message for everyone to know, follow and believe in.

188,ChristophCinema,Better Than Most Disney Animated Movies,10,3 April 2012,"After the release of Toy Story in 1995, 3-D animation took over, and 2-D animation slowly began to fade...which is a shame, because one of the 2-D films that got over shadowed was the 1999 film, ""The Iron Giant"". Not only is it an animated masterpiece, it is one of my favorite films of all time. Whenever I bring it up in a conversation (even to this day), people have no idea what I'm talking about; which is unacceptable. So what do I love about this film? Well....everything. I love the 1950's setting, I love how it pays homage to the atomic age of cinema, I love the characters, I love the emotion, I love adult tone to it, I love the music, the animation, the message, and...I love that it's not Disney. This movie has such a natural and balanced build to it, that I don't think most Disney films at the time could achieve. Everything about this movie just feels very natural, and the characters act/react in a way that feels real, and not so cartoon like. The emotions this film conveys are also very natural, and doesn't seem to go overboard. Most Disney films of the 90's had moments where the film was telling you ""Feel sad here"", or ""laugh now"". ""The Iron Giant"" has sad moments and funny moments, but they're not shoved in your face. ""The Iron Giant"" didn't have any musical numbers, cute little animals, or an over the top comic relief, but so what? To me, those kinds of things dumb down the film (not always) and weakens it in the long run. ""The Iron Giant"" didn't need any of those kid movie gimmicks; and the result is a kids movie that gets better with age. It's a shame that this movie didn't get the same attention as films like ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", because to me, it really is one of the best 2-D animated films of all time. it is highly underrated, i highly recommend it, check it out.",The Iron Giant
189,John-405,Genuine sentiment without corn,10,13 August 1999,"Like all high quality animations, this is a movie for kids and adults.  The vividly drawn relationship between the giant and the boy is the most...human...and touching (without being maudlin) that I can remember in recent years, and that includes both children's films and so-called adult drama.  For that reason, maybe, it drew genuine emotion out of me, something that hasn't happened since I first saw Barry Lyndon (of all things) years ago.
It's sad that Disney has such a stranglehold on the genre. I was so grateful that there was not a single syrupy pop song in this movie that on the strength of that alone I might award it a ""10"" on IMDb.  But fortunately, Iron Giant succeeds more for what it is than what it isn't.",The Iron Giant
190,nedron,Nearly perfect animated film,10,30 December 2000,"This is a great film on several points. FOr one, there are no pointless musical numbers. For some reason, American production companies feel that all animated films must have musical numbers. This film thankfully has none.Don't read further as the next comment is a possible spoiler:I would have given this movie a 10 had it not been for the cop-out re-assembly ending.

On top of that you have the fantasies of a kid, only in this movie they are real.

It's probably Vin Diesel's greatest role (because he doesn't say much, and sometimes less is more).The Iron Giant learns mankind's inhumanity and obsession with irrational fear. The Giant is essentially a war machine, his purpose to conquer and lay waste to entire civilizations. Not unlike Frankenstein, he's ostracized and feared merely for existing. But from friendship he learns mankind's capacity to do good even in the face of impossible danger, and ultimately, sacrifices himself out of love.I liked how we don't get to know where exactly the robot came from, or why it's here. I think that we're supposed to draw our own conclusions when we see strange visitors from the starry sky. And because we naturally fear what we don't understand, we feel the need to destroy it. Because it makes us look at ourselves in the mirror, and question our own purpose and existence. Maybe the things that fall from the heavens are too good for this world.",The Iron Giant

The Iron Giant is a really great picture about some values that have been forgotten in most movies nowadays.  The Iron Giant feels more human, the animation really doesn't matter when you realise how awesome this movie's story is. It's really doing great here in Mexico and I'm kinda glad, because it's the kind of movie everyone should see. The final sequence is so sad you won't help the tears falling from your eyes.

Yet i see horrible films like the much over-hyped Tarzan, which is so silly it offends me, getting all the way up, nevermind it contains all kinds of Disney cliches - that female gorilla sidekick really made me want to kill her -. The Iron Giant is simply put, one of the most beautiful and simple stories ever told in an animated feature. I went to see it 5 times in my country, and each time i couldn't help the tears. Gee, this is such a very touching film. Now i know it's getting high on video rent, but you'll never experience it as in the theater. It really makes us think about not judging a book by it's cover.

199,octagonproplex,The One That Matters,10,15 June 2017,"More of a retrospective commentary than a review; what follows is completely spoiler-free in terms of plot points, but is intended as an admiring post-script annotation to the film's thematic legacy and resonance.The Iron's Giant is simply the best animated feature ever made and one of the most subtly sophisticated conscience driven ""films"" in all of Cinema. In addition to the elegant old-school cell animation, wonderful adventure, and truthful humor -- auteur Brad Bird's tour-de-force quietly and magnificently emerges as much more than just another innocuous warm-hearted family friendly diversion.Set in cold-war paranoia & post nuclear Rockwellian/Capra-esque New England/Americana nostalgia, this all-time classic gem -- with sublime eloquence and earnest maturity -- beautifully dignifies powerfully principled pronouncements on prejudice, xenophobia, alienation, anti-authoritarianism, nonviolence, and moral identity; Of lonely boyhood reverie and single-working-mother/son repport; surrogate family in father figures, secret bonds & empathetic brotherhoods; tolerance, compassion, free will, devotion, sacrificial love, and the nature of consciousness and the concept of a spiritual soul. But far from heavy-handed frothy proselytizations, it wisely finesses those virtues subtextually into the nuances while rendering a completely involving fantasy story of a boy coming of age through a symbiotic relationship with an otherworldly friend that rivals Spielberg's ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" in pure exhilarating enchantment! This movie is all lunch-boxes, no soap-boxes.Perhaps The Iron Giant's most profound platform however is the bitterest pill: running against the modern hedonistic zeitgeist of coddled indulgence and fickle fluidity to shrug, ""The Iron Giant"" gracefully drives its primary message that each sentient individual of seminal volition is autonomously responsible for the decisions that ultimately define their position as a cognizant being. Regardless of birth or influence, every conscious entity with the capability to express love or hate beyond self preservation, has the self-agented obligation in full context of their ethical effect upon the existing morale they help mold to mindfully choose what and who they are -- even at the rejection of core inclination. It's the total opposite to excusing one's self because of proclivity. In this life each Soul is sole, but the lone quest to find purpose through harmonization, because all are connected beyond the dirt we return to, and everything counts, every attitude ripples, and every action reveberates. No one who is able, can dismiss that ability by citing implement or impediment as the deciding factor to their path. It doesn't espouse the total embrace of what one wants most, but rather the total thoughtfulness to what wants most from one -- what is right and worthy of one's ""oneness"", and where one fits into carrying that through for the sake of togetherness.Disney will glorify the vapid virtue of ""being yourself"", while The Iron Giant will implore the existential ethic to find yourself by being beyond just yourself. The high-road will always be up-hill, but ""you are who you choose to be"".In empathetic powers, anyone can resolve to become ""Super"" by submitting to a supreme ethos/pathos/logos which reciprocates the sacrifice of superficial selfishness with the significance of synthesis in shared sacredness.Who you choose to be is dependent on what you will choose to service.",The Iron Giant
200,Bobzilla85,Best Animated Film I have ever seen!!!,10,2 July 2002,"Disney should take note!!!  The Iron Giant is an example of animated cinema at its best - Warner Brothers did not resort to cheesey characters, corney gimmics, and trite characters, instead they created a wonderful, whimsical storyline about everyones boyhood fantasy, which can be related to by anyone of any age.  I am not going to bother repeating the same accolades which people before me have posted, all I will say is that The Iron Giant is unlike any animated film I have ever seen, and it deserves the attention of even the most mature and jaded of movie-goers!  A stupendous film!",The Iron Giant
201,catalog,Great for Kids and Adults,8,2 December 1999,"Why was this movie a flop in theaters?  Probably because there wasn't a complete toy line, collectible card game, and Burger King tie-in to coincide with the release.  It's really unfortunate too, because The Iron Giant is one of the few movies of recent years that is great for kids.Blending traditional cel animation with a completely digital character (the Giant), this movie is a feast for the eyes.  The story, while simple, contains so many levels that both children and adults will find something of interest.  Children will react to the story of a small boy with a robot for a pal, while adults will see how the movie mocks the Cold War paranoia of the 50's.There are no musical numbers.  There are no talking bears or raccoons.  Just a good story that is backed up with excellent animation and a big heart. This movie is one of the best animated movies of the decade, and hopefully audiences will discover it on video.",The Iron Giant
202,rvnc,One of the finest animated films made,9,26 March 2007,"The greatest compliment I could give this film is that I have viewed it twice, as an 11 year in the cinema, and as an 18 year old at home, and enjoyed and loved it on both occasions. It's been said already, but this film really does combine the best of both worlds. It's silly and slapstick enough to make the kids laugh, and has enough subtle and sophisticated humour for the adults too. In fact, the comedy is what makes this film so special. The jokes are consistently excellent, and it's highly unlikely that anyone can keep a straight face throughout. It's funnier than the Disney/Pixar efforts, save Toy Story, and in fact it's better than most comedies you'll see.The characters are great too. Hogarth Hughes ( Eli Mariental) is actually not that annoying for a Hollywood kid. His double-act with the Giant (Vin Diesel) is entertaining and endearing. Halfway through, Beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jnr) is added to the mix, and together it's a highly amusing triumvirate. However, the show, and the best lines, are stolen by FBI agent Ken Mansley (Christopher McDonald). Mansley is the ideal kid's movie villain, just bumbling and stupid enough to be humorous, but with enough menace to get by. His interrogation of Hogarth itself is chilling, as is his hate of the giant, demonstrated during the finale. The other character of note is Hogarth's mum, Annie (Jennifer Aniston). She isn't a prominent part of the story, which is strange given that Aniston is the biggest name in the cast list. But thankfully, she doesn't wreck the film either.The film is at it's weakest when it's trying to be profound, and there are certainly a few cheesy lines as a result. However the film carries a decent anti-war message, as well as preaching acceptance to those who are different, which is to be applauded in a kid's film. In particular, the Giant's initial refusal to allow himself to become the weapon he was designed to be is well done. Even better is his subsequent rage and rampage at Hogarth's apparent death at the hands of the army, which shows us we can all go off the deep end sometimes. That's pretty deep for a U-rated picture.Other things to note are the animation, which is excellent, different from the Pixar style, but impressive nonetheless. The 50's soundtrack is great too, adding authenticity.In conclusion this is a film that really punches above it's weight, providing great comedy and a decent message that anyone of any age can enjoy. It's said often, but this really is a film that the whole family CAN enjoy. Highly recommended.",The Iron Giant
203,sonicfan5715,One of my Favorite Movies Ever.,10,6 February 2013,"I was probably 12 the last time I saw it. After work I saw it on the animation/kids DVD section at Target for 5 dollars. So I picked it up, remembering that I enjoyed it and thought it'd be a nice addition to my DVD collection. And now I can say that it is definitely in my top 5 favorite animated films, and one of my favorite movies ever.As a kid, I loved the whole idea of a little kid running into a gigantic alien robot and having to keep him a secret, very similar to E.T., except Hogarth's alien friend is over 50 feet tall and difficult to keep secret. When I saw it back then on VHS, I enjoyed it just as much as any other animated movie I liked at the time. But I didn't really grasp how wonderful the film truly was because I didn't fully understand what truly makes a movie great. It was a cartoon, so I didn't take it seriously as watching ""Lord of the Rings"" with my dad for the first time, and treated it as such: a good, fun animated movie, but not on par with something ""live-action"" and ""teen/adult oriented"". Now having watched it again at the age of 21, there is so much this film does, so simply and subtly in fact, that it is basically perfect.You already know the synopsis for the film, but what about the characters in the film? The best thing about all of these characters, Hogarth, his mom Annie, the agent Kent, the junkyard artist Dean, and of course the Iron Giant. The relationships between these characters are so enjoyably real and seamless, their personalities meshing, connecting, and clashing as they interact with one another. Hogarth's relationship with his mom seems like a very real mother/son relationship, and the fact that he doesn't have a dad isn't shoved in your face like most Disney movies would with dead parents not being present. It very subtly presented with a brief picture of his dad on a picture frame towards the end of the film, but by then you've already got the picture that he only has a mom and why. And the fact Kent is so hellbent on finding the ""giant"" and is constantly prying Hogarth's brain to get him to spill the beans is just hilarious at times. Hogarth absolutely does not like this guy, and has a very funny way of getting back at Kent, which I won't ruin for you. With Dean and Annie, you don't get any forced, ""this is awkward, kind of like you but can't say it"" scenes, in fact you don't see them together too much, but any moment you see them together, you can tell that they have a genuine attraction towards the other. Last but certainly not least is Hogarth and the Giant.Hogarth runs into the giant out of sheer curiosity as to what took their satellite disk one night, and is obviously terrified and yet memorized at first. Eventually he has to save the giant from being shocked to death from being tangled in some power lines but shutting the power down at the station. He loses track of the robot after that night, but decides he wants to go out an try to capture evidence that there really is a gigantic alien robot in the woods. Sure enough he runs right into him, and so their friendship begins. And through simply trying to teach him to speak and trying to lead him to a safe hiding place, you see that the giant is actually something of a curious little kid, learning and adjusting to this new world. You know he came from some faraway advanced planet, but we really don't know why or what things he is capable of (until towards the end), but you're just so drawn into how through so few words and sentences, this Iron Giant is such a wonderful character.Brad Bird and everyone who took part making this film truly put a genius effort into bringing the giant to life. Through his limited facial expressions (eyebrows, small-big bright eyes, adjustable mouth and iron teeth) and voice work by Vin Diesel, they truly make you feel for this curious, little kid ""giant"", and the personal turmoils he has when comprehended the death of a deer, or whether or not he has a soul of his own because he has a personality and feelings. My personal favorite scene is when the giant thinks Hogarth is dead, how he gasps in shock, how his hand trembles after touching his limp body, how he just starts to whimper and cover his face in sadness, it's just perfect. The Iron Giant himself is one of the best animated characters in history, with a team of amazing artists behind him to turn a what might have otherwise been a generic robot into a genuine, connectible, and memorable character.Ultimately the moral in the end is ""killing is bad, and take time to love what you have around you always."" People bash this film so badly for the fact that it's a robot and should not have feelings, and all the political references and connections it has in this film, and I do not believe that's any reason to bash it whatsoever. I could go on scene by scene narrating the movie and explaining what I love about each scene, but I want to let you all watch it for yourself.The Iron Giant is a solid 10/10 for me, with amazing animation, wonderful and lush characters with supreme voice actors, such as Jennifer Anniston as Annie or Harry Connick Jr. as Dean, and a simple easy to follow story that is pieced and scripted together so well, that it just comes out perfectly.

I decided to watch this based on the good comments in ""The Animation Addicts Podcast"", and I was not disappointed.The animation is pretty good, classic 2D, with some CGI here and there (I read the giant is actually made on CGI). The way they animated the robot is pretty good, the movements (sometimes being clumsy, like not being really sure how to fit in the surroundings), the voice, the fact that it barely talks, and just open his mouth to say something relevant.Overall, I think this one is a pretty good family movie, that I think adults can also enjoy (I am on my 30s), because besides of being fun and funny, touches some topics such as how we are scared of what we don't know and tend to judge before even giving us the chance to get to know something or someone.

The film is beautifully directed and the voicing seems to have a depth and character that I can never remember seeing in any Disney film.  It is in many ways a re-telling of one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and is just as powerful, intelligent and moving.  It is with out a doubt one of the best animated and sci-fi films ever made. Klatu Viratu Niktu (I hope I spelled that right).",The Iron Giant

212,jpgranera,"Had giant expectations, but still pretty good",8,2 January 2019,"From the great director Brad Bird, The Iron Giant it's a good family-friendly movie. It does have some appealing, an emotional plot and a good ending, but, for me, it stays at 8/10 because I feel I have seen this type of movie before. A kid that founds ""someone"" that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English? But I think that the movie let that to the audience to think.
I recommend this movie to a family with kids, you will enjoy it for sure!",The Iron Giant
213,maffilms13,An American Classic.,10,17 July 2002,"This is truly one of the greatest animated films ever made. It's the story of Hogarth; an imaginative, young boy, growing up with out a father, at the height of the 'red scare.'  When he crosses paths with a alien robot fallen to Earth an amazing friendship, adventure and education begins.This is a heartfelt, E.T.-like tale which should be a classic in every child's video collection.  It teaches of acceptance, non-violence and true friendship while never hitting you over the head with morality or gitty music numbers.  But what makes this film even more amazing is that it is just as entertaining for adults, as it is for kids.In 1999, two classic animated films were released; one by the goliath of animation, Disney, and the other by Warner Brothers.  Toy Story 2 went on to gross over $200 million, while The Iron Giant grossed only $23 million. America missed this film while it was in theaters, but we have a second chance on video.  Get this film for your children... for yourself.  I assure you, Hogarth and his Iron Giant will win a permanent place in your video collection and your hearts.",The Iron Giant

This film is probably the single best animated film (not counting Princess Mononoke, which Disney made sure was buried before it could take foothold) to reach the big screen over here in years. Wonderful animation, likeable characters and GREAT writing set this gem apart from its rivals, and despite not being a giant box office draw I suspect its gonna be revered for many years to come by children and adults alike.

215,ryanaustinf,"It's like a live action would-be movie, cept it's animated.",9,5 June 2009,"Well, nothing much to say for an introduction here. Simply, about five years before ""The Incredibles,"" was made, Brad Bird was attached to direct one of the most underrated movies of all time, The Iron Giant. I gotta say, I only watched this twice and even though I know what happens the second time, it is still heartwarming and Brad Bird's best. Let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will appear as an event in the movie.Our main characters are The Iron Giant (Vin Diesel) and Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal). The relationships in this film are amazing and subtle. They aren't shoving it in your face they just play it naturally and the relationship between these two is no exception. They're both fun characters and The Iron Giant gets his funny moments too. The main villain is probably Kent Mansley(Christopher McDonald). He's just annoying and a jerk but that's what makes him such an awesome villain-ish. He's obsessed with destroying the Giant that he forces Hogarth to tell him where it is and if he doesn't cooperate, he's gonna take him away from his mother! ... YOU SICK TWISTED *******! The supporting characters are, Hogarth's mom, Annie Hughes (Jennifer Aniston) and Dean McCoppin(Harry Connick Jr.). Once again, the relationships here are very subtle and the cross relationships of Hogarth to his mom, Dean, Kent, and the giant are amazing (and all that that implies lol). The action in here is amazing, especially near the last part. Kent gets the AIRFORCE to strike at one giant. Once again, forgive me for this... YOU SICK TWISTED *******! Now the story is simple. A robot crashes on Earth and a kid befriends it. The kid tries to prevent anyone seeing him but A SICK TWISTED *******! ... sorry tries to find out about the robot and tries to get the army to destroy it. Well, this is on my top movies list and I'm proud to give The Iron Giant, 88% awesome!",The Iron Giant
216,tristandetwiler,This was originally my favorite movie of all time.,10,21 December 2013,"Plot:The entire set-up of being placed in the 1950's was a work of genius. They didn't go for the stereotypical look, but actually tried to make accurate without shoving it in your face. I'll talk more about this in the visuals. The plot starts with a giant robot crash landing onto earth. His origins are unknown and aren't important to the movie, which is fine by me. He encounters a boy named Hogarth Hughes. They become friends over-time and soon go through challenges that are caused by paranoia and military suspicion. It's great stuff (And it all makes sense).Characters:Hogarth is a very likable and funny pre-teen that has a unique personality. He's described soulfully through dialogue and not directly to the audience. We find out, just as a side trait, that he keeps pets that he finds out in the wild. In the diner his mother works in, they have a minor but funny conversation about the previous pets he's brought in. Speaking of which, his voice and tone he keeps the whole film work nicely; his outbursts aren't whiny, annoying, or irritating. I can't think of another child character in a movie done as well as Hogarth. He's also very clever when it comes to finding ways around obstacles. It's a little hard to describe without going on forever, but his actions, motivations, and lines spoken are... well, just great.The Giant is a character in itself. He's come down to earth for... some mission. But due to a bump on his head, he has amnesia. So, Hogarth takes the chance to teach him and make the robot good-natured. It's a delightful story between the two characters. I wouldn't have minded if there was no action in the movie and just focused on those two. Vin Diesel is great as the Iron Giant, just saying.Oh, and the side-character Dean is the highlight of the movie... I guess?Visuals:As I already stated, the 50's look of this environment is fantastic. There's a scene that takes place after the Giant and Hogarth encounter for the first time where Hogarth is in a classroom. He's busy drawing the Giant in his notebook and arguing with other students. In the background playing on a projector is an Atomic Holocaust Safety Video. Considering it's the 1950's during the Cold War and after World War II, this is a great subtle throw-back to the time period. The people in the diner I already talked about are dressed perfectly for the period. Dean, for some reason, looks like a Greaser, while all the waitresses and waiters wear the correct attire. In a later scene, Hogarth is watching a Black & White Science-fiction horror film (Involving Brains) and eating Twinkies. What's cool is the packaging on the Twinkies is made to look old-school; it's great.Sound:Much like how the sounds the Speeder-bikes from Star Wars made lingered in my minds (And I'm sure a lot of other peoples' minds), the footstep sounds the Giant creates are so memorable. I don't know what it is about them, but I can never get them out of my head. It's part of my collective memory now. The voice of the giant is also memorable. I don't know if it's because of Vin Diesel or the editing process, but the robotic voice the Giant gives is something that might give you an eargasm. It's just absolutely crazy how cool his voice sounds.Of course, the one of the bigger reasons this criteria gets a five star is the musical soundtrack. It's one of the best scores I've ever heard. Right up there with some of John Williams' work. I'm not kidding.Enjoyment:Every time I went to my neighbors' house to be babysat, I watched this movie. I must've watched this film over thirty times. I've honestly lost track, and yet, it still doesn't get old. I loved this film as a kid and I love it now. I can't say much else but, GO WATCH IT!",The Iron Giant
217,imdb-8212,"Not for KIDS, but still an OK movie.",4,31 July 2008,"This movie surprised me. After reading the reviews online I thought this might be a great movie for the kids. Wrong! There are several instances where the characters use ""colorful"" language that kids under 14 probably shouldn't hear. Check the ""Parental Advisory"" page here on IMDb for the exact words and occurrances. You'll be surprised. We watched about 15 minutes of this till the first ""who the hell"" popped up then decided it wasn't really the show for us. No wonder it bombed at the box office. I'd have walked out had I been sitting in a paid-for seat with my kids in tow. It's sad too, because the wife and I watched it later and it was a decent movie. Maybe they should change the marketing strategy when something like this is released so it's NOT specifically targeted to younger viewers.

This movie is a spectacle of riches, from Cold-War parable to coming-of-age fable to a simple meditation on what it means to be a friend.  You even have one of the best, thoughtful, explications on what it is to a sentient being.  A lovely, enjoyable, fantabulous film that anyone - even a hardened cynic like me - can enjoy.My only question is - Ted Hughes wrote the original novel?  Ted Hughes, the guy who was married to Sylvia Plath when she committed suicide?  I always thought he was a jerk. After seeing this movie, I guess I was wrong.  I just hope he had the chance to see what a masterpiece they made out of his work before he died in 1999.Kudos to the voice work in this movie, by the way.

Hogarth is just at home while Mom is working the late shift when he uncovers something in the woods: a giant robot-like figure with its food source being metal. Hogarth meets the giant again and the two become friends. But everything out of the ordinary (and outta this world) always attracts the U.S. Government. Throughout the film Hogarth must try his best keeping his new friend a secret from everyone else, keep it safe from an annoying government agent who happens to have rented a room in Hogarth's house, and teach the Giant itself about humanity and how important life is.THE IRON GIANT is a great movie for any generation for any movie night when nothing's on.

The friendship between the Iron Giant and Hogarth is what makes the film charming, funny and deeply heartfelt. The story is touching and has very heartfelt, deep messages such as ""You are who you choose to be"" and ""Souls can't die"". The Iron Giant's death was absolutely heartbreaking! ;-;
The animation is absolutely gorgeous and I love the work the animators did with the Iron Giant! The character designs were really nice and very distinctive. The characters themselves are very likable and the performances that the actors give them are top-notch. Overall, The Iron Giant is a touching and beautiful tale about a friendship between a boy and a giant robot. It's sad that the film bombed at the box office and people didn't give it the attention it deserved when it was released back in 1999. Definitely a must-watch and I cannot recommend it enough!",The Iron Giant
225,cyberbat,If it weren't for the animation I would give it a 10!!,9,17 April 2000,"Which is basically it. When you compare this type of animation with (dare I even mention it) Disney you feel quite let down. The people are unrealistic but this can be tolerated because they are stylised, which is fine if you like that sort of thing. Some of the backgrounds ARE beautiful especially the sea and snow, it is also nice to see how the weather and seasons slowly change throughout the film. The main problem (as I see it) is that some objects, especially the cars and quite noticeably the tractor looks 2 dimensional. This is the first time I have ever noticed this on ANY movie. I suppose it is because the quality of animation does not match the background.The actual robot is computer animated but because he is put into a movie with low quality animation you simply don't notice it, instead the robot looks like he was drawn with great care by a skilled animator (with normal animation) and then placed in TV quality animation.But I am afraid I am just being picky the quality of animation is unlike don Bluth or Disney but it is effective. After 10 or 20 minutes you forget about the animation and fall in love with the story.This is one movie where the STORYLINE TOOK PLACE OVER THE EFFECTS AND ANIMATION. Which is a nice change especially since the horrible trash Disney produced last year with Tazan. This is what made it such a pleasure to watch. It is a touching film in which I dare anyone to view and not feel compassion for the giant robot with a big heart. The animators did a noticeably good job at making a ridged iron face show warmth and love .(WARNING THE NEXT FEW LINE MAY CONTIAN MINOR SPIOLERS DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW)The part when he prodded the dead dear and when he thought the boy was dead was quite frankly a masterpiece of effort. It is this sort of atmosphere that so many modern animated films lack. The LAND BEFORE TIME showed this depth of sadness and it can be seen with this film as well. To really enjoy a happy ending you must first feel sadness and pain. This is how I feel anyway a sad part in a film is essential for getting it's audience to care about it's characters. I gave this movie 9 out of 10, because I really do think the quality of animation (not the style the quality) could have been improved.But the best comment I can make on this movie is this- I asked my little 7 year old brother whether he liked the movie or not and he said `I WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN' . He had never said that about any movie he has seen. So I can think of no higher praise for such a brilliant movie.",The Iron Giant
226,dpenny,"a masterpiece, plain and simple",10,29 December 1999,"I'm 25 years old.  I have no children.  So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw?  Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.The film's plot is similar to 'E.T.' - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents.  Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher.  It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make.  The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature.  The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people.  We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.I dare not give away the climax.  All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending).  The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen's score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.Sadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves.  All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross.  Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years.  See it now, so you can say you discovered it before everyone else did.",The Iron Giant
227,robotman-2,About a Machine Man,10,7 September 2000,"Without doubt one of the best films of the past ten years, animated or not, IRON GIANT is a fabulous love letter to 1950s science fiction b-movies and b-fiction. The central figure, the alien robot construct, is as grand and cool a physical design for a robot as ever put on film; but then this is perfectly balanced with the character of the robot, a being who is sentient and loyal, as he understands it.The robot, befriended by a young boy who is himself a SF b-movie junkie during the reactionary '50s time period, engages the boy and the boy's beatnik confidant with his trust, allowing the film to briskly detail the Giant's advances, as he comes to understand his own nature, the possibility of becoming a deadly weapon and a ""monster"" from the boy's comic books, and his understanding of heroism and love for his friends. In a world which is dangerous for the robot, and he in turn a danger to it because he is built to destroy, rather than love, the Giant's story of coming to the realization of what and who he truly is has a poignancy that is simply amazing. It is a story of redemption as great as the classic monster icons that have inspired this movie, such as the deformed Quasimodo of Notre Dame's saving of the beautiful, wrongly-accused Esmeralda who will be executed unless he protects her, even if he must die for her, loving the unattainable beauty he loves but can never have, or Frankenstein's Monster destroying himself and his newly-created Bride of Frankenstein because they are, in the Monster's opinion, a vile affront to nature.The Giant too realizes he must do what he has to, in order not to be a monster. It is one of the grand moments in cinema when the robot faces his fate, and becomes more than human in the process. An amazing film worth seeing many, many times.",The Iron Giant

230,gab-fan22,A Masterpiece...,10,7 July 2017,"There's a moment in the Iron Giant where young Hogarth Hughes finally meets the ""metal monster"" his town has been talking about. He is terrified as we all would be by this unknown being, but then it stops in its tracks. It sits down, begins to mimic Hogarth, he teaches it words and they form a bond of trust. Its probably about 45 seconds of screen time, but it transforms the story from one of fear to one of the complex beauty of the human imagination and human connection.The Iron Giant a precursor to Brad Bird's Pixar success with Ratatouille and The Incredibles is a haunting piece that captures history and emotion all in one. It's 1957 with Sputnik orbiting the Earth, everyone is terrified by the Red Scare, the unknown and that beings from other worlds are trying to destroy us. The Giant comes from this unknown world above us and is whispered about with concern, fear and suspicion.But young Hogarth Hughes sees the monster before anyone else does. It's like a child that is lost, he teaches it lessons, nurtures it and gives it a sense of purpose. Both are loners to an extent, and their bond of friendship along with the Giant's transformation is one of the more beautiful bonds you'll see in any film. There is another moment whereThis is not a Disney film with songs or dances. Bird is above that, and instead creates a setting in small-town America that mirrors the feelings of the world in that historical era. Hogarth himself fears how people will see his ""friend"", and the fearsome government agent Mansley captures this attitude of 1950's America in that the unknown is a threat to public safety and that it must be stopped, isolated and removed at all costs.I will try not give away the ending, but all I will say is be prepared to have your heartstrings pulled at. The Giant is remarkable symbol of not judging something before you know it, it has a personality and emotion that experiences pain, joy and sadness and a willingness to do the right thing at any cost. Much like ET, King Kong and even Inside Out there is a moment where something must be given up, in order for the greater good to occur and that we choose our paths no matter what others try to shape us as or determine for us. While the Disney Renaissance broke the mold for modern animation, the Iron Giant does something all of those films(many of which I do love could not.) It teaches us something about the unknown, and that what we fear can actually turn out to be something that isn't trying to kill us or hurt us. Instead, what we fear can be something that transforms our way of thought, and gives people a new sense of hope and resilience in the face of destruction and war.10/10",The Iron Giant

This is perhaps the best animated feature in the past 10 years (or maybe even further back than that.)  What makes it so great?  First of all, it is a visual marvel.  The film contained some of the smoothest animation ever, with CG elements flawlessly incorporated into the traditional elements.  Vibrant colors and wonderfully expressive characters make the movie much more than a cartoon - it is merely animated life. 	The story is a gem.  The hypothetical question ""what if a gun had a soul?"" lies at the heart of the plot, and issues, of spirituality, redemption, and sacrifice make the plot much more substantive than anything Disney churns out to make a quick buck.  There are parts where I actually teared up.  Yes, I admit it, a strapping young man such as myself actually cries at films if they deserve it, and this one does.  The fact that very few people actually saw this film is very upsetting to me.  It is the perfect movie for parents to take their children to, because not only will their children be wildly entertained by the endearing, larger-than-life title character, but they as parents will also enjoy a rich movie experience - thanks to a script which pokes fun at Cold War hysteria and propaganda, among other things. 	This review might ramble, but let's wrap it up like this:  This is a fabulous movie for the young and old.  If you are a parent, PLEASE show this movie to your children.

A couple of anthropomorphic elements can be seen in the robot, but it's not hard to suspend disbelief since these elements are subtle and not the primary driver of character development. The robot character is somewhat enigmatic/alien, which only serves to make the story more intriguing rather than confusing.The other characters are enjoyable, even though they are somewhat flat (to varying degrees).  The humor is not as sophisticated as, say, The Simpsons, but it's never annoying, overly juvenile, nor over-the-top as it can be in most Disney movies.By the conclusion, I found myself unexpectedly moved, thanks to the well-crafted sympathy-inviting character development.  Despite the use of some standard plot devices, The Iron Giant is certainly a movie I plan to share with my future children, and one that I will enjoy right along with them.  Highly recommended.  Overall score: 9.",The Iron Giant
240,jaijaijai73,Great visuals wrapped around a horrendous infantile morality play,3,26 May 2009,"This movie is beautiful, and full of neat details. Visually, I'd give it at least an 8. There's lots to love technically, the sound is great, the characters really work, and there are a lot of laughs. Unfortunately, the story is wretched at best, and actively evil at worst. The message is hypocritical in the extreme. Where Spiderman told us (rightly) that ""with great power comes great responsibility"" this excuse for a moral tale says that with great power comes nothing but danger, and suicide is probably the best course of action. All violence is bad, and we can all choose what we want to be; even giant killer robots can be transformed into giant pu$$ies by the miracle of a small boy's love and friendship. Barf. As a moral tale, this is hypocritical and irresponsible garbage at best. The boy solemnly lectures the robot about death, saying ""guns kill"" as if that's a bad thing. They mourn the death of a deer at the hands of evil hunters. But the boy is not a vegan, nor is his mother. So killing is okay as long as someone else does it, at a distance. That's amoral hypocrisy, nothing more. It gets worse- obviously the Iron Giant is a symbol, and he is the hero of the story, because he is the only character who changes. What is he a symbol for? Well, for Man's ""destructive"" and ""flawed"" nature. But the Iron Giant is obviously and explicitly a creation of something- he's a built artifact. So this implies a Creator metaphor; we're talking about God as Creator here. But God in this story is flawed, defective: He built a good, tender, sensitive creature and made the mistake of encasing that gentle soul in the form of a weapon. Or, He built a weapon and made the mistake of giving it a tender heart. Either way, God is flawed. Worse, the giant killer robot can't even distinguish a toy from a real threat, and thus self-defense is portrayed as unacceptably dangerous. And the only way to remedy this flaw is for the unfortunate creature to ""nobly"" sacrifice himself rather than taking responsibility and using his tremendous power for good. The message is therefore ultimately Satanic: God is bad, and you're better off dead. When good people (and robots?) refuse to take their power, bad people take it by default. After all, a key component of evil is the lust for power over others. When evil has convinced everyone that the only acceptable method of resistance is pacifism, disempowerment, surrender, and suicide, then evil has truly won. Have we really fallen so far that we no longer know how to fight the good fight? Do we really think that all violence is ""bad""? Have thousands of years of culture, morality, and civilization really been swept away by a few decades of propaganda? The fact that this artful piece of toxic amorality has gotten so much acceptance suggests that much has been lost. The film is worth seeing as a pretty film, but I'd recommend sitting down afterward and discussing the values and lessons here with your family, in a critical way. I sure as hell wouldn't plunk my kid down in front of this with no discussion, because it's a powerful piece of propaganda that needs deconstruction. Or just destruction.",The Iron Giant

What an amazingly talented cast of voice actors- (Jennifer Aniston as a working class single mother? who knew!) Along with the animation, and the fun music this makes for a real treat for the whole family! It's a fabulous movie and a joy to behold.

Basically it looked another pointless adventure film aimed for kids about a boy who encounters a robot and have to run from a bad guy. I think there were even fast food promotions for it so I ignored it like many others did. It wasn't till a few years later that for some reason, I decided to rent and watch it. Kill a few hours, enjoy the evening.I was quite surprised at what I discovered.I never expected to encounter such a rich story with beautiful animation, three dimensional characters -- even the antagonist wasn't your run of the mill cliché. I especially loved the intelligent dialogue that provided sharp insight into Cold War and even modern day paranoia. And the climax...just not something no one but Brad Bird and his team would have the cajones to put into a kids film.Many have harped on the marketing and I am piling on, Warner Bros. screwed up royally. They clearly had no idea at the time what they had by promoting it as a basic kids film instead of as a film all could enjoy and respect.It is a marvelous film, if you haven't seen it, go now.",The Iron Giant

A small masterpiece in every way...except for the politically-correct (read: heavy-handed) way that guns are portrayed. It somewhat bothered me in the theatre, and seeing it on TV only reinforced the feeling. The only instances of gun use in the movie, including the toy one that Hogarth uses, were correct and not objectionable in the least. But the writers just had to hammer their point home. Oh, well. I found the movie a rare gem and still cannot understand why it wasn't a smash. Maybe it was over a lot of heads. I even bought a copy, despite the not-so-subtle messages. Buy it when you find it.

I especially loved the references to Superman!  Those sequences where the Iron Man imitates the Man of Steel were my favorites.",The Iron Giant
255,thickets@uniserve.com,My review to use for your magazine.,10,7 October 1999,"Set in a small town in Maine during the height of the cold war, this film is based on Ted Hughes' children's book ""The Iron Man"" and brought to you by The Simpsons' Brad Bird. It tells the story of a giant, amnesiac robot who falls to Earth, and is eventually befriended by a local boy, Hogarth Hughes. Hogarth must hide the robot from a paranoid government agent who suspects it a Soviet weapon of war. The truth is that the robot is indeed essentially a giant gun, but hails from a distant planet and bears unbelievable firepower! Ultimately, it is the friendship with the boy that brings out the robot's compassion and humanity, and saves the town from annihilation.I liked this film so much that after I saw it, I emailed everyone on my many contact lists and practically begged them to put on their shoes and hit the theatre to support this amazing film. Why should I care? Because I am an ardent believer in supporting cinematic--or any other--efforts that one feels strongly about. And I do feel strongly about this film. The Iron Giant is one of the finest, well-written, non-formulaic, intelligent pieces of animated film I have seen in a long long time, and I watch a lot of cartoons. At the time, just a few weeks after the film opened, it came to my attention that it was not doing so well at the box office. My bulk email was a modest campaign to boost awareness of the film, because in Hollywood there is just one truth: the success of a movie is based on its gross. If a piece of s**t movie does well, more piece of s**t movies like it will get made. Conversely, if an intelligent, well-written movie does not make its financial mark, that kind of movie will fall out of favour with the fatcats who make the decisions back at the studio. I personally would hate to see the entire genre suffer because The Iron Giant is recognized by a wanting dollar return and lack of ubiquitous Happy Meal tie-in claptrap. The Iron Giant is an inspiring movie that can be appreciated by adults for its genuine characters and solid story (not to mention its welcome lack of ill-placed Disneyesque singalongs) and by children for its well-executed animation and springboard for the imagination. If you can still find The Iron Giant in theatres, go see it (again). If not, it's coming out on video shortly.And if you don't want to take my word for it, I can send you the barrage of reply emails I received, with subject lines like ""Thanks for the great recommendation...I loved Iron Giant.""",The Iron Giant

But in the meantime, just SEE IT!!",The Iron Giant
257,Kevin-278,One of the best,9,24 November 2000,"Like most of the people to have commented on this film I can find nothing bad to say about it.  It was certainly a breath of fresh air from all the Disney-ish cartoons out there.  The animation is of a classic style and goes together with the actors voices perfectly.  The setting, which is in the cold war culture of the 50's, is also an added bonus to the story as the fear of the Giant gets out of hand. The bottom line is that it is very enjoyable and teaches a lesson about violence and intolerance in a way that isn't sappy.  Enjoy",The Iron Giant
258,somemoviesilike,Touching Filmplay,10,11 May 2001,"A small spoiler in here.The Iron Giant is the most absolutely amazingly definitely best animated filmplay I have ever seen. It is just perfect, you must see it yourself. At the time of writing it is showing on Sky. It combines humour with drama, and deals with the problems experienced by young teenagers as situational euphemisms i.e. one actually expressed in the film compares the giant, a metal creature of gigantic proportions, as a little child lost within a supermarket. This complies with everything I've written.If you haven't seen this film, even if you are of late teenager years like me, you will love it. It have received a lot of skeptical looks when mentioning this to schoolfriends, but I don't really care. It's their loss.The only comment I have against the film is the ending. It seems out of place. Comparing it to the life support machine starting to bleep after some time is a possibility, but this is (in most cases) a good thing. I reckon that it is good that a child should see that all good things come to an end (like the film), and that nothing lives for ever, not even giant metal monsters. That doesn't stop me awarding it 10 out of 10 though.Great voice acting, though the movie is always introduced hyping Jennifer Aniston, as though she is a 'special guest ""appearance""'. This is wrong - she is as good as the rest of the cast, no more. Why isn't Eli Marienthal higher in the cast list?",The Iron Giant

Toy Story 2 and Shrek are my all time #1 CGI movies, but The Iron Giant (which I thought would suck) turned out to be the biggest emotionally affecting 'cartoon' I have ever seen, its even more of a tearjerker than the ending of Monsters Inc.
Beautifully animated and expertly executed, I was in both tears and perched on the edge of my seat for the last twenty minutes. As of writing this review the movie is ranked #235 in the top 250, I strongly agree with its placement among the best movies of all time, but strongly disagree why it's not within the top 100. I have noticed one or two people (mentioning no names) have rated the movie a 1/10 simply because they disagree with its ranking, despite admitting they enjoyed the movie. Henceforth I have voted it a 10/10. Which incidentally is my rating for the movie :)Please just buy the DVD, for a mere £10 or less (or $12 if you are in the US) get this movie. I can't possibly imagine anybody would not like it, it's superb. 10/10 - AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC!",The Iron Giant
260,TiNA-MARBLE,Great,10,29 November 2003,"The story is about a young boy named Hogarth who lives in 1950's Maine with his mother. He happens to go out one night and he finds an iron giant..hence the title. He first is very scared, but then he realizes the giant has a good heart. So then Hogarth befriends Dean who likes to make art out of metal. Hogarth hides the giant at Dean's house when Hogarth finds out that Mr. Kent Mansley who works for the government wants to destroy the giant because they feel that some country sent him to destroy the world. The Iron Giant likes to eat metal so where they put him was a perfect place for him to hide. Other problems occur between Hogarth and Mr. Mansley because they go through great lengths to kill him. What I thought of this film was that it was very beautiful. I had a tear in my eye when The Iron Giant saw the deer that died and the giant had feelings for it. I also was sad when the giant thought Hogarth was dead. I felt what the giant was going through. I liked the character of the iron giant because he risked his life to help Hogarth because he really loved him. The ending was also very sad because (BIG SPOILERS!!!!)

261,mjpetty7,My All-Time Favorite Film,10,24 June 2016,"I'll admit it, I am beyond biased when it comes to The Iron Giant. I first saw the film when I was four back in 1999 and I immediately fell in love with it. I wanted to be Hogarth, I wanted my own Iron Giant, and quite frankly I wanted to be a filmmaker. This movie was my first real introduction to Superman, it was my first introduction to the Cold War, and it showed me the kind of America that I wanted to live in.I know that's heavy and seems like a lot, but honestly The Iron Giant is one of the best, if not THE best, animated films of all time, as well as just straight-up science-fiction masterpieces of all time. Just recently the film was re-released into theaters for two days as the ""Signature Edition"" with two additional scenes that they fully animated for this re-release. I was so excited to go but seeing as how I got to school in Bozeman, MT I was afraid that we wouldn't get it at our theater and I would have to drive to find one, but nevertheless it was there for two nights, and I went both even taking my 11 year old sister to one of my viewings.The Iron Giant teaches you the moral lessons you need to survive childhood and develop into who you are. ""You are what you choose to be"" is the main quote from the film and it certainly rings true. The Bible says, ""For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he..."" (Prov. 23:7), and this is exactly the message that this film points towards. It's funny, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's compelling, and it's over-all original in the sense that the magic of this movie has never been re-created on the big screen, in my opinion.The Iron Giant is my all-time favorite film, so I'm obviously biased, but beyond the emotional attachment I have to it from my childhood, as I continue to watch this film throughout my adult life, it always brings out the child in me, and I always tear up at the end (don't worry, I won't spoil it). This movie rocks, and I can't thank Brad Bird enough for bringing to life Ted Hughes' ""The Iron Man"" in the form of The Iron Giant.",The Iron Giant

264,GDC,Another ignored classic,10,7 December 1999,"One of the most frustrating things about Disney's stranglehold on the animation industry is that when a truly great animated film does come along, fans ignore it in droves.  Such a case is The Iron Giant. Many people are blaming its poor showing on Warner Bros lack of advertising, which is ridiculous. I dislike the idea that unless we're inundated with Happy Meal tie-ins and action figures, the film is under-advertised. There certainly was adequate advertising for this film; it simply wasn't in titanic Disney proportions.The Iron Giant is, no exaggeration, one of the best animated films of the last ten years. As a childhood fable, as a view of fifties foreign paranoia, as a statement on violence, it works perfectly.  There isn't a single flawed scene from beginning to end. And it proves conclusively that animation can work without cute animal sidekicks or overwrought musical numbers; just a great story, brilliantly timed comedy, and some truly touching moments.The combination of cel animation and computer imagery is seamless, with each technique used to its best effect. The voice-acting is top-notch, with Christopher MacDonald particularly good as the paranoid government agent. Having not read the book myself, I can't vouch for the film's adherence to the original story, but I highly recommend it to any lover of animation.Incidentally, lest you think it's purely for children, I watched it with a group of men over thirty, and we all loved it. Let's hope this film gets the discovery on video it was denied in the theater. A solid 10.",The Iron Giant

The voice talents are well cast with Vin Diesel doing a great job voicing the giant. The animation of the giant is also good with the last act of the film, when the giant shows a new side, being easily as good as Disney could manage.For me, the film is made by the story and the issues raised, especially the ending which always brings a tear to my eye.All in all, go and rent this film, it not just for kids but for the whole family.10/10",The Iron Giant

What I saw was a wonderful event of animation, with plenty of depth and imagination.Animation has come a long way from the days of the old Looney Tunes and Disney cartoons, and now with The Iron Giant we have a seamless merging between traditional 2D animation and 3D animation, with the Giant being fully animated in 3D.  The result was the most visually stunning animation I have seen in a while.The Iron Giant had a great story to it (being based on the book by Ted Hughes), one that was meaningful and one that allowed interaction with the viewer to use their imagination (there are questions which are not answered, you really have to use your imagination).  All the voice performances were exceptional, and really added to the characters in the film, instead of making them one-dimensional.  The Giant in particular had a lot more emotion then you'd expect from a giant robot made from iron.This is the best animated film I have seen since The Lion King, it had everything in it, from laughter to drama, from happiness to sadness (the ending brought tears to my eyes).  This is an animated feature not only for kids, but for anyone of any age.  It's a shame it wasn't given the exposure it deserved, it probably would have done a lot better at the box office.  If you're a fan of animation, or you just want to see a great family film, you have to see this.  I give it 10/10.",The Iron Giant
274,mrslimm,"A delightful surprise, this is one of the best animated films ever made and is as good as anything put out by the House of Mouse.",9,19 April 2003,"Warner Brothers' only previous half-way decent full-length animated film was [Space Jam - a animation / live-action mix that saw Warners' greatest stars (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, etc.) team up with the world's highest-paid sports superstar Michael Jordan to entertaining though easily criticisable effect. Aside from this their efforts have been somewhat useless. Content for a long time to release other peoples animated movies such as [Thumbelina] and [The Pebble and the Penguin] (go on, have you seen them?) they decided, on the strength of [Space Jam]'s success, to reopen their famous theatrical animation department in the hope that they could recreate the legendary success of their 50's short cartoons with full-length animated features. Their first effort, [The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot], boasted as many words in the title as there were famous names in the voice cast but, sadly, boasted almost nothing else. Except that there were almost as many words in the title as there were people who went to the cinema to see it. So, it is somewhat of a surprise to find Warner Brother's Feature Animation department releasing this upon an unsuspecting movie world, for this is the finest animated feature-length film to be released that has nothing to do with the mighty Disney studios (as of February 2000 and, it should be noted, that the key animators on this movie are all ex-Disney). Forget DreamWorks' glossy but botched [Prince of Egypt], forget Steven Spielberg's over-rated executive-produced [An American Tail], forget the excellent [Antz], forget even [Toy Story] and [Toy Story 2] (both co-financed and released by Disney anyway). The Iron Giant is cinema's finest non-Disney animated feature length film. It is a real shame that so few people saw it. Here's hoping that the home video market will discover this real gem.",The Iron Giant

278,sigil,OOPS!!! Nearly Forgot,10,11 January 2001,"** I don't know that this is allowed; if it is, it's a P.S. that goes with my other comment made just a few minutes previously.  I forgot to mention two of my favourite scenes in the movie.  One is when Paranoia-stricken and completely insufferable Government entity  Kent Mansley appears on the scene of a chomped-up transformer substation. After a few infuriatingly condescending remarks to the locals and jotting a few scathing remarks into a tiny notebook, he gets into his car to drive off, presumably to find the ""Big Stuff"" he was only just so helpfully (?) explaining to the locals. ** It's at this point that he discovers exactly half the passenger side of his vehicle has been bitten off and he jumps 10 feet or so out the driver's door, producing a noise that sounded a lot like ""ohmyGOD!!!!""Before he can make a coherent further statement the rest of the car disappears, apparently meeting an identical fate (the Giant must have been a bit peckish at the time). ** The other was when the Giant imitates Hogarth's rather unimpressive ""Banzai!"" leap into the lake and, of course, causes a fair-sized tidal wave. ** I happened to notice Dean McCoppin, sitting on a bench behind the inevitable newspaper, was still sitting in, and holding onto, his bench while being tumbled round by the water and watching an intersting display of fish swim by. ** He finally lands in the middle of he road, looking rather like a drowned cat.  A truck pulls up just then and a brief exchange ensues:""Hey!""  Without turning his head Dean looks askance at the truck driver and says carefully: ""Yeah?"" The driver then says, somewhat unnecessarily, ""You're sitting in the middle of the road!"" Without moving even slightly Dean again answers identically, except with considerably more force: ""YEAH??""  At which point the driver mutters ""Allright..."" and drives off. ** The second time I saw this scene I cracked up laughing.  You really just simply MUST see this movie -- period.  You'll have no idea what you're missing otherwise.",The Iron Giant

280,Djonn,Best SF picture of the year -- maybe the decade,9,19 August 1999,"Forget STAR WARS, ignore THE MATRIX, skip DEEP BLUE SEA.  The best science fiction picture of 1999, bar none, is this quiet and well-rendered story of a boy and his robot.The animation is good if mostly understated -- technical highlights are the opening starfield and storm at sea, as well as the sequence in which the Iron Giant finally shows its full range of abilities.  But what shines is the writing.  Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies have produced what may possibly be the best screenplay ever written for an animated feature film.  As good as a few of the Disney features have been, and as good as Fox's recent ANASTASIA was, this is better.  Add a solid, effortlessly smooth ensemble of voice performances, and you have a story that viewers will remember and return to with pleasure.Look for THE IRON GIANT on awards ballots -- and not just for animated films or SF movies.  The term ""classic"" is overused, but this is a movie that deserves the label.",The Iron Giant
281,AbuAhzan,A mirror held up to humanity,10,12 August 2000,"The enigma of the Iron Giant's complex nature is a literary device to make us look at ourselves.  The Giant is a mirror of humanity; making him a space alien is a way of bringing another perspective to our human nature.  On the one hand, we humans seem to be programmed as death machines.  On the other hand, we have compassionate souls.  Which will predominate?  The key to the whole story is simply ""You are what you choose to be.""  Your innate compassion can override your death program.The character of Mansley the bad guy is so malicious as to be actually psychotic.  His only function is to show the madness of the human death programming taken to extremes.  It makes us look back on the Cold War and wonder what the hell went wrong.  The name ""Mansley"" symbolically reflects on Man, who has allowed this insanity to run away with the human race.  The Giant's choice of compassion over death programming is inspiring and uplifting; to get that across in a movie any more you have to disguise it as a kid's movie, but this one is equally enjoyable for kids and adults alike.The technical side of this film shows the impressive advances in conventional animation, to remind us that computer animatronics are not necessarily the last word in this art form.  The most stunning light shows, however, involve weapons of mass destruction.  The Giant's seemingly miraculous ability to regenerate himself as well as whip out a mind-boggling array of destructive devices reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's dictum: ""Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.""",The Iron Giant
282,Figaro-6,The Best of Two Worlds: Adult and Kid,10,9 August 1999,"All too often, ""family films"" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake.  But then along comes  something like ""The Iron Giant"", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.""The Iron Giant"" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways.  Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula.  The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey.  The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney).  No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the ""world"" of the movie, or to advance the plot.  At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.""The Iron Giant"" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well.  It's sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget.  Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue.  Go see it!  Tell your friends!  Then go again!  (Repeat as necessary.)P.S.  I find myself comparing the Iron Giant character to Martin Donovan's character in ""Amateur"".  If there is anyone else on earth who has seen both films you may wish to entertain the notion yourself.",The Iron Giant

At first I got excited from all of the positive word of mouth I had heard about the film.After 30 minutes of this movie, I was completely baffled. I would have to say this was okay at best.  The little kid was so happy and enthusiastic that it made me nauseous.  I sat there dumbfounded that adults would be so swept away with this.  There was the obvious symbolism that can I am sure is mentioned by other users.  Making a cartoon artsy doesn't make it good.  It should first have an entertaining, non-nauseating plot.

I picked up a copy of the special edition DVD expecting an entertaining animated film. What I actually got was not just one of the best animated films I have seen but one of the best films ever. It takes you to another world but never strays from reality and when watching it you forget it's animated. The characters are so well written it puts most live action films to shame. If you pass this off as a kids film you will be missing out on one of the most immersing and emotional experiences you can get from a film. The voice cast are perfect, the animation stunning and the fact this film flopped when released is nothing short of criminal. I urge anyone even with only a passing interest in cinema to watch this film and prepare to be amazed.

I used to work in a video shop, and when i recommended this to parents, they looked at me blankly (""it aint Disney, it can't be that good"") but i forced them to take it, and when they brought it back (several days late most of them) they thanked me.

297,egghead-5,"Beautiful, positive entertainment without the overkill",10,19 August 1999,"I thought about this movie for days after seeing it with my family.  It conveys the ""innocence of childhood"" (pardon the cliche) as well as E.T. Like Toy Story, it keeps you engrossed in a simple, but engaging narrative by animation that actually augments, rather than detracts, from the story. Possibly most compelling, for me at least, it manages to transport you into the paranoid yet somehow rarefied atmosphere of the Cold War, much as the 1993 film Matinee did.I had prepared myself for the worst - stillborn plots, offensive characters, embarrassingly inappropriate musical numbers, etc. a la Disney.  When I walked out of the Iron Giant, I found myself wondering how they managed to do everything so *right* when so many other animated films get it so wrong. In fact, this is really the only good animated kids' film since Toy Story (and woe unto us when Toy Story II comes out).As a professed gun nut, I would have expected to find the movie's anti-gun message objectionable.  That wasn't even remotely the case.  The gun thing was only the toe-nail to the greater issue of self-determination, and the deliberate sacrifices that one must make to choose the path of heroism, rather than destruction.  That point is made poignant because ???spoiler??? .....................the Giant is a destroyer by nature.I also couldn't get over the way the movie made me wonder why it is so hard in film to stay away from violence when striving for heroism.  It seems that every hero has a mean streak, or is eventually forced to violence by the bad guys; for once I had no reservations explaining to my son the Giant's motivations for doing what he did.Finally, I hope that everyone sees this film.  It deserves better than it will get, and we deserve more good stuff like it.   It's not every day that you can look at the viewer reviews and see that *every* one is positive. That speaks volumes.",The Iron Giant

We're not anti-Disney, we'd just like to see something off THEIR formula.  Problem is, there aren't many high quality alternatives.  The Iron Giant is a notable exception:  the animation, storyline, direction, characters, and voices are superb.  You won't find a bad or campy bit of dialogue in the entire film.This is a well-written, uplifting story which pulls you in without resorting to maudlin stuff.  By keeping the number of core characters to a minimum, the film-makers allow us to learn about the players and see their personalities unfold without resorting to cheap dialogue tricks.  Despite being animated, the characters seem real (my oldest asked me if it was a true story - a previously unheard of question about an ANIMATED film).There are few other animated films which captivate my children in this way.

300,bogiefan-2,One of my favourite films - animated or otherwise,10,10 January 2005,"Like most reviewers here, I stumbled across The Iron Giant. Frankly, I don't know how I missed it in the theatres, but I picked up a used VHS copy a few years back and fell for it. I recently purchased the DVD version and have rekindled my appreciation for this lovely film.In addition to being a polished gem of a morality play, it is well animated, and well voice-acted. Perhaps Hogarth is portrayed as too obvious a scamp and Kent is too over-the-top in his zeal but the subtlety in the Iron Giant's limited movements and ""vocabulary"" more than make up for it. In any case, this is an animated film - we should expect ""cartoonish"" characters, right? Perhaps it was the total lack of cutesy animals doing Disneyesque song-and-dance numbers, but I found myself noticing the ""acting"" of these characters. Don't worry, I snapped out of it soon enough...Unlike some, I didn't see TIG as a slam against militarism. In fact, the General here (nicely voiced by John Mahoney) shows a considerable amount of balance. Rather, the film is about personal growth and change, respect for life, values, and the bond of friendship. This side of the film works so well that the Giant's utterance of one word - ""Superman"" - toward the end of the film sent me searching for the tissues. (word of advice: keep them handy).Do yourself and your kids and watch this film. Appropriate (IMO) for ages 3 and over (including adults!).",The Iron Giant

Very contrary to my belief, I found The Iron Giant to be an incredible tale of friendship and love. It's not one of those sappy little kid movies...it really has meaning to it. Eli Marienthal was an excellent choice for the voice of Hogarth, also, and who knew that Vin Diesel could sound like a robot? I can't tell how many times I've watched this movie with my little brother now...it has to be on of the best animated movies ever created.

I had no idea at all that the voice of the giant is Vin Diesel! I would never of thought that he would do anything like this. Just goes to show how many actors are typecast.

""Tarzan"" could have been one of their best since ""Beauty & the Beast"", but for two things stupid animal sidekicks and ""Trashing the Camp"" a worthless number that slowed the pace down. But this is not a review of ""Tarzan"". ""Iron Giant"" had wonderful characters that lended humor when called for without idoitic gags, tears (Yes, I was nearly crying at the end), and boundless joy that made the audience feel uplifted and like they were a kid again. And it was rated ""PG"".A side note to parents, at the screening my husband & I went to, there were a lot of kids (we do not have children at this time). The parent who sat beside us had a boy about 7 or 8. the child was asking a lot of deep, good questions that the parent did not have time to really answer and discuss with the child. So, a word of warning... if you have young children you may want to screen this movie by yourself and then take your child. This does not mean that this is NOT a good movie for kids, I just think you need to enjoy it too and give yourself time before or after the movie to discuss issues with your child.The animation was super and way beyond Warner's last attempt with ""Quest for Camelot"".

Parents who take their children to see this masterpiece will get so much more out of it than the tykes will.  I think people who remember the early stages of the cold war (which I don't, I wasn't around yet) will watch this film with a nostalgic eye, while those of us who remember the last stages of the Vietnam War will see analogies to the anti-war sentiment of the time.

It's more adventures than Finding Nemo, more funny than The Incredibles, deeper than The Lion King, the recall of the Cold War feeling is brilliant, and the final action-scene is... Oh my God it's SO GREAT!. Well, I think The Iron Giant is the best animated movie ever made. MUST SEE!!!",The Iron Giant
313,Anansi00,"What more animated movie should be: a thoughtful, funny, touching story.",9,11 December 2004,"After seeing this movie, I was overcome by a strange feeling. I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent, funny, touching, and visually superb, and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A) computer-animated, or B) based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best American-made children's movies I have seen in a decade: 8.5/10.0Now, I'm a 17-year-old who is slowly transitioning into the domain of movie buffdom, which basically means that I am watching a stream of movies based on recommendations from friends, critics, and the IMDb Top 250 list. I got this one almost by accident after the local rental place could not find the movie I was really after, choosing it basically on the knowledge that it was the previous project of Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles (a personal favorite). After watching it, I felt like calling up every mother I knew and telling her to have her children (and herself) watch this.The Iron Giant revolves around an adventurous young boy in 1950s small-town America who discovers a gigantic robot out in the woods that has arrived on Earth from goodness-knows-where. He befriends the robot, while trying to keep him safe from a nosy government agent. The story seldom lags, with a series of comical adventures connected by the boy's growing relationship with his friend. This movie is very appealing as entertainment. The voices are well-done, and the scenery is also terrific. Most importantly, though, is the animation, which is a bright spot from this time period. The characters are well-drawn, especially the Giant, who through terrific design, lifelike movements, and clever small touches (i.e., the eyes) seems both alien and human, imposing and childlike. Furthermore, the animation is comical. I don't know when I have ever seen slapstick or punchlines so well-complimented by the animation. The script, written by Bird and based off the book The Iron Man, is also very well done. Though the movie relies upon a few minor crutches common to children's movies, it is still very original and clever.One thing that I must point out about this movie is its morals. Throughout the movie, the main moral of the story, about the Iron Giant learning and choosing to be good, is actually fairly adroitly handled. At no point when the subject comes up, including standard sentimental climax, does the idea seem contrived. Throughout the movie, evidence of Bird's influence by comic books is quite evident, and his ultimate message about heroes (variations of which will resurface in The Incredibles) is relevant and sincere. However, I do have to say that the secondary moral, about the evils of xenophobia and paranoia, both of which are embodied by the movie's antagonist, the government agent and the military, are very politically charged. While this may sound initially controversial and politically charged for a kids' movie (the second of which I do not deny), I noticed that it was in large part a thoughtful spoof of Cold War America, with jokes as well as valuable lessons about ""duck and cover"" and 1950s nuclear edginess that I found very clever.On a final note, I do have to point out that this movie had me laughing hard, but more importantly, it brought me closer to tears than any animated movie I can remember (including Bambi), closer than I like to admit. I wish that I had discovered it sooner, and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it the way I did.",The Iron Giant

317,litos,In the world of animated flicks this one gets five stars.,10,1 December 2004,"Iron Robot is a well crafted film and I'm not surprised to see Brad Bird knocking it out of the park for Pixar with the recent hit The Incredibles.Obviously this movie is about a Giant Robot and a little boy in Smallsville, USA, so I'm not sure why someone would write 5 paragraphs about it. But I will say this; it is a perfect movie for children and even an old dude like me. Most of the time animators and directors don't have the talent to breath life into animated characters without exaggerating their actions and reducing them to cartoons. But Brad Bird has a gift, he really gives the machine a soul, one that almost brings you to tears if you get mushy at films (I did).If you have kids buy it. If you don't have kids, rent it and enjoy a really good movie.",The Iron Giant
318,Mike S-3,A very realistic animated movie packing an emotional wallop,9,13 June 2000,"I, for one, have tired of the typical Disney formula movie. The movie that has the same rags-to-riches plot, the search for self, the romantic culmination, the comedic sidekicks, etc, etc. And Disney has watered down its moral message so much to prevent offending anyone that there is hardly a moral message at all. The Iron Giant is the movie you WISHED Disney would make.The Iron Giant is set in the late 50's. The dual optimism and fear so prominent in that time period is reflected in the movie and used to great effect. Young Hogarth represents countless boys who have grown up wistfully dreaming of space fantasies. Mr. Mansley represents the fear of the Soviet Union and nuclear annihilation of that period.The boy finds the Iron Giant and is at once scared and sympathetic. The movie goes on to show how little boys are actually more adept at looking past fear than adults.The relationship shown between the boy and the Giant is one of the best demonstrations of friendship I have ever seen in the movies. This is a relationship you care about, far more so than in any of the Disney movies.And, unlike Disney, this movie takes moral stands unambiguously. The wildly careening and inappropriate grace is hysterically funny and very much believable for a young boy. And the thoughtful conversation between the boy and Giant about having a soul is filmmaking at its finest. The Giant's uncertain status-- Is it alive? Does it have a conscious? Does it have free will?-- makes one think more about the afterlife as a result.The confrontation between the Giant and the military is the one part of the movie that is action-oriented. And, like the rest of the movie, it is well-done.Unlike the Disney movies, or most any others, this is a movie that you do not know how it will end. I thought this as the confrontation started-- and wondered, will I be disappointed? Not to fear-- wow, the ending is super! It packs an emotional wallop. In fact, this ending will have you and your friends talking for days.I've been frustrated all too often at Hollywood movies for such technical brilliance but lame plots-- here is a sterling exception. The plot is what makes this movie so memorable. And not only for what it says, but for what it doesn't. Questions such as Where did the Giant come from?, Does Hogarth have a father and, if so, where is he? are left unanswered-- and the movie is all-the-better for it.The excellent story, emotional resonance, and wonderful moral messages make this a movie not to be missed (unfortunately, too many have since no Disney marketing campaign backed this film). Here's a movie truly for kids and adults.",The Iron Giant
319,Pete-139,A Perfect Movie,10,13 February 2000,"Everything about this movie is perfect.  The animation style mimics live-action filmmaking to a tee.  The merging of CGI and hand-drawn animation is invisible.  The plot is great and the acting is sublime.But more important than all this, the film is great entertainment while communicating important messages without being obnoxious.  It gently makes a comment against guns, while at the same time reminding audiences that each one of us has the ability to choose who and what we are in life.",The Iron Giant
320,Plectrum-2,I get choked up thinking about it.,10,8 August 1999,"As for all the other comments I've read here, I agree whole-heartedly.

I do get choked up thinking about it and the power of its simple message long after the fact.I recommend it to everybody, 2 to 102.  You must see it to believe it. And I think the Academy should, too.  Bravo Brad Bird! and congratulations Warner Brothers.",The Iron Giant

The most intelligent thought provoking film to come out of Hollywood in at least five years.",The Iron Giant
322,WED-2,Family entertainment takes a dive for the worst.,1,24 August 1999,"At the preview for ""The Iron Giant"", my kids could barely hold their excitement.  They've seen the commercials and knew several of the characters already.  In advance, I had warned them that there weren't any sidekicks or catchy songs as they've been accustomed to.  By the end of the film, their eyes were downcast...and it wasn't from sleep-deprivation.The film isn't all that it was hyped to be.  Much of what you see in the commercials is the whole film...why go to the theaters?  The commercials tell you everything!  Moreover, the story isn't widely original, either. If you've ever watched ""We're Back"", ""Pete's Dragon"", ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" or ""E.T."" (all children/family movies) then you've already watched this film.  It's the typical plot about children who find an amazing discovery, keep it a secret, abuse its powers, and learn to extend beyond their own feelings.  For my children, probably the most damaging to the plot, however, was their dislike of the giant itself.  There wasn't enough to connect him with the audience which undermines the emotion the rest of the film builds on.  Without the connection between such a key character, the audience loses interest.Furthermore, the movie's animation barely matched with current releases. There weren't as many lush color tones or smooth-running lines to make the film visually appealing.  Don't get me wrong, Warner Brothers has had great animation in the past (although its last ventures ""Quest For Camelot"" and ""The King and I"" were complete flops).  If they'd only stick with Bugs Bunny, they'd have the works played out in their hands.  ""Space Jam"" was wildly successful, plus the shading and colors of ""old"" characters brought new life to their persona.  In several aspects, ""Space Jam"" was far superior from animation to plot, aesthetics to witty lines when compared to ""The Iron Giant"".  Where past Warner Brothers animation aimed toward the family, ""The Iron Giant"" aimed for the commercial.  Several times, the topic of Superman (a character which Warner Brothers owned) was brought up.  Soon, we'll see Superman figures lined up with the corny Iron Giant banks and toothbrushes.Lastly, there's the objectional material.  For the first time in my life, I saw the main character of a cartoon, feature-length movie use the restroom. The use of the bathroom is all too common in live action films, but they've begun to pass surreptitiously into cartoons.  Why does such a scene need to take place?  All in all, the film relays an anti-government atmosphere. The main characters are always on the run while officials heartlessly chase its ""victims"".  I admit, several children's books are perfect for Hollywood. This one may have been one if taken from a different approach.",The Iron Giant
323,ghost-43,A great movie whose only fault was the distribution,10,12 September 1999,WB distribution fell big time with this movie;  This movie could have sold two or three times more tickets with good publicity.  It is a movie you would be glad to take to see with your children and recommend to your friends.  I saw it twice at the theatre and the last movie I saw twice was Matrix because my wife did not have a chance to see it.  Definitely a buy recommendation and not one where I will wait for the video store to sell the used ones.,The Iron Giant
324,AaronB-2,Beyond the animation standards,10,22 January 2000,"Animation today seems to be focused on grabbing the attention of both children and adults.  The fact is most kids going to see a movie are going to see it with their parents, so it makes sense.  There are pop culture references, and jokes strewn about movies that fly over the kids heads, but keep the adults entertained while struggling through the movie.  But as of late I've found that all the kids get out of the movie is funny looking characters doing funny looking things, and all of the dialogue is centered on the adults.  The reason for this is the idea that kids don't get it. Some movie makers think that movies with adult themes will be too much for the child, and in turn stupify the movie.  Once this is done they have to fill it up with silly references and jokes that the parents will like.  The end result is a less than entertaining film.  Then there are the movies that say ""screw it all"" and actually focus on making a good animated feature. The Secret of Nimb and The Black Cauldron, and now The Iron Giant are each excellent examples of this.  The makers of these movies give the kids a chance to get what the movie is trying to say, and the kids do.  The political undertones of the Iron Giant may not be something that the kids will relate to and say ""oh look, a cold war metaphore"" but they understand the story and plot, possibly better than those who see what this is all based on. Too add to everything, the animation in this film is fantastic.  Great film all around.",The Iron Giant

It does make changes to the original story but this creates a separate tale which can stand on its own. Its very entertaining, with jokes for kids and adults. Featuring excellent voice acting, a strong plot with good pacing. The animation, using the more traditional approach, is impressive and most importantly adds to the story instead of becoming the story. The ending will make you get that tingly feeling that I believe tells you that the emotional story is effective. If you are a fan of the book you have nothing to lose, if you like the story, you win and if you don't well the book's still there. Oh and its Vin Diesel's best film to date.",The Iron Giant

331,realtalkrealfolks,"One of the best animated movies of all time, period.",10,16 July 2018,"The first time I saw this, I was only six years old, but I remember it so vividly. It was one of the earliest movies I saw in a theater. We came in a few minutes late, during the diner scene when Hogarth is trying to convince his mom to let him keep a pet squirrel. I remember Mansley getting his face squished in the door was one of the funniest things ever. I remember memorizing the scene of him pestering Hogarth with constant questions, after he rents the empty room in his house. The exchange of Mansley asking ""Where ya going, champ, chief, slugger? Where ya going? Where ya going?"" and Hogarth screeching back, ""I'm going out!!!!"" is something my siblings and I still quote to this day. But mainly I remember being absolutely flabbergasted when the Giant sacrifices himself to save Hogarth and the town. Growing up in a a Christian household, going to church twice a week, a story that ended with someone giving up their life for everyone else, was, well...biblical. I remember sitting in the theater and having the thought, ""He gave up his life so all those people could live"", running through my brain over and over. I couldn't comprehend it. I was too shocked to cry. Watching it for the first time as an adult? I sobbed. The tears started when the Giant realizes he can fly, and Hogarth gleefully tells him, ""Try holding out your arms in front of you, like Superman!"" and they didn't stop because I knew what was coming. When I was a six year old child I was too young to understand the themes of xenophobia, patriotism, choosing a different path than the one given to you, etc. All I knew was that the Iron Giant ""gave up this life so those people could live."" Superman, indeed.",The Iron Giant
332,DaySleep,Pure Movie Magic!,9,1 November 2004,"Some of my friends told me to see this film years ago, when it came out in '99. At the time I though: ""The Iron Giant? That's a kids movie right?"" Well, now that I've grown up enough to enjoy kids movies, I casually picked it up at the video store- let me tell you this movie is awesome! It was barely advertised in it's day, and despite Brad Bird (The Simpsons, etc.) and a well known cast, ""The Iron Giant,"" unfortunately, is overlooked my most viewers.Granted, it's not a perfect film. There were some inaccuracies, especially with regard to the military, and some might argue that it runs short at 87 minutes.

333,sketch_09,Surprisingly Mature,9,6 December 2004,"The most unfortunate thing about this film was how underrated it was when it came out. To be honest, when I heard about it, I thought the animation looked simplistic and was another straight to video deserving flik.But when I actually got to see it finally on TV it blew me away. Not only was the animation actually an artistic and in a few ways a technical achievement (nicely handled discrete use of CGI), the story and dialogue were far more sophisticated than the usual strand of kid's animation. So much so I became far more intrigued emotionally by the characters and the major plot twists then I have been by many live action movies. The humour was also subdued to short well timed bursts, not completely unbearable like some tripe i've experienced. The story is also told in a way that is logical; characters react accordingly to events and everything happens in a way that can't be questioned and is completely understandable, not overly simplified for the younger audience. Plus the ending was satisfying and a great way to round off an unforgettable experience.It's a shame therefore that such an emotionally vibrant and surprisingly mature animated movie has to be judged on how good it is just by how much cash it rakes in, a dire fate that many a movie has been subject to. 10/10",The Iron Giant

The story is heart warming and heart breaking at the same time. It is a story that every writer wishes to tell, but at a simple form so that it can be told to children as well. It is a story on how a child can get past every difference in another person/object, where adults cannot.I will watch this movie for years, and will pass it onto my children when the time comes.

Vin Diesel, even though not saying much, delivers the voice of the Giant with heart, passion and conviction.And I have not yet touched on the humor! There were many parts during this film that had me laughing in hysterics! Bird truly has a knack for making us laugh.Lastly, this movie truly has a message to it that I firmly believe in.

I perceived it as part E.T., part Short Circuit, and part Terminator 2.The comic aspect of this film had me in stitches, particulaly the loose hand in the bathroom. It also had a couple of priceless visual references to other films; my favourite being the jittering teacup from Poltergeist.What came as quite a surprise was that this very capable exploratory, and very lethal war/invasion machine was self-aware. He saw the value of life and made a conscious choice that he did not want to be a destroyer of life. And it was delightful to see that although he had a destructive instinct, he chose to resist it and be what he wanted to be.

Iron Giant was so much better than Tarzan, and worlds above Wild Wild West, and yet it has made less than five million for it's first three days.  This is horrible.

The camera angles and  moves were excellent; if this had been a live action movie it would have been superb to watch.  
In summary: Subtle, cool, funny, involving, moralistic, sad, fun, exciting.... this is one to buy on DVD and hand down to the kids as they grow up.    When my 2 year old climbs up on the sofa, opens a cupboard, searches out the VHS tape of Iron Giant, rewinds it and puts it on the TV, for the 5th time, you know he likes it.

Most of all, I can't wait until my two boys (3 and 1 1/2) are old enough to ask me about all the questions this movie raises, and to be as moved by the story as my wife and I are. Only regret is not seeing it on the big-screen.Note to Brad Bird -- your movie will still be watched and loved years after the name ""Pokemon"" is long-forgotten.  Thank you.",The Iron Giant
347,HouTex,"Regarding the ""gun"" issue . . .",10,6 April 2003,"Just watched this movie again on DVD with my 4- and 6-year-old boys. Truly this is a great movie for raising all sorts of moral, ethical, and religious issues with youngsters.Which leads me to the reason for this post:  To respond to the many viewers who are obviously concerned about the ""negative"" portrayal of guns as being ""heavyhanded"" or ""politically correct.""Several of these viewers quite accurately point out that the depiction of guns is uniformly appropriate.  Guns *do* kill, after all, and no one should be shocked to see a hunting rifle used to kill a deer (the hunters themselves are not in the least negatively characterized) or military weapons used in combat (and again, the uniformed military - in contrast to Kent Mansley - are depicted quite positively and professionally).  Even Hogarth's numerous toy guns are given realistic treatment.Regardless of your position on hunting, gun ownership, foreign policy, or whatever, please don't miss the opportunity to use this movie to discuss these issues with your children in context.  The Iron Giant, after all, is himself a (the?) super-gun -- that's the whole point of the movie.  It's not the gun itself that's good or bad, but the use to which it's put.  Guns don't represent evil in the movie, they represent power.  And each one of us has in us the power to do great good or great harm, within our families, our workplaces, our communities, and so on.  Teach your child to recognize his or her own powers and understand that he or she has the freewill to choose how they are used.  Teach your child to be Superman.And of course, like other posters, you will find political and religious themes in the movie, or any number of other things.I'll say it again -- what a great movie for kids to see.  Please don't automatically conclude its message is simply ""anti-gun"" just because guns are depicted being used as intended.",The Iron Giant

I don't cry easily during movies but I could not help myself with this one.  The relationship during the idealic 1950's between the boy and his pet robot was truly the best piece of script writing to come along since ET.

350,nb-3,A magical film with stunning characterisation - unmissable,9,22 April 2000,"An enjoyable and inspiring animated film for all ages. This modern fairytale is a story of a great friendship - that of a lively yet warm-hearted boy and a 50 foot iron robot with some very human qualities.In 1950s America, post-war suspicion and paranoia give rise to a fear of all things different. A huge robot from outer space is seen as the ultimate threat. Yet one perceptive child discovers that the Iron Giant has the ability to combine superhuman powers with the best qualities of human nature. With the encouragement of his young friend, the gentle giant discovers his soul and learns about trust, friendship and respect for life. But will his true dark purpose lead to the destruction of all he has come to love? Is the power of friendship strong enough to save him not only from the prejudice of others but also from himself?This intelligent and moving film has much to offer to anyone who can put their own prejudices against `cartoons' and `kids films' aside. While being good fun for children, The Iron Giant has a depth that adults will appreciate. This is a more `grown-up' kind of animation - no singing and dancing animals and attention-stealing backdrops, no caricature sidekicks or too bad to be true villains; instead we are treated to a fully developed characterisation rarely seen in feature animations. The result is a small cast of believable and engaging characters who draw you into what could have been a predictable plot and who leave you caring about what happens to them. The story is by turns amusing, touching, dark and inspiring. The animation is clever and seamless, but understated, letting the wonderful characters take centre-stage.A talented cast breathe life into the characters, without turning them simply into animated versions of themselves - unlike some  actors in rival films. Hogarth Hughes, the boy who befriends the giant, is given a spirited and natural performance by young X. The powerful voice of Vin Diesel, by turns frightening, funny and heartbreakingly emotional, gives the mysterious yet lovable giant his soul. Jennifer Aniston is utterly convincing as Hogarth's mother Annie - a hardworking single mother desperately trying to be a responsible parent to her imaginative, energetic son, yet secretly in need of some magic in her own life. Harry Connick Jr. gives warmth and humanity to trendy beatnik Dean, a scrap-metal yard owner who turns junk into `art' and works hard at seeming a cool laid-back kind of guy, but hides behind the smooth exterior a caring, fun-loving personality who needs others more than he would admit.  Y is the villain of the story, as Kent -, the government official on a quest to destroy the `monster'. Driven by fear, misunderstanding and most of all the opportunity for self-advancement, Kent poses a real threat yet is also amusing and thoroughly believable. It is this thoughtful characterisation that makes the film so special - there are no extremes of good and evil, simply characters not very different from us, with a range of emotion and the potential to become what they choose. The films message, `You are what you choose to be,' reflects not only the inner struggle of the Iron Giant between the desire to do good and the instinct to destory, but the struggle inside of us all to be the best that we can.I was pleased and not at all surprised to see this animation voted number one in the Children's category on IMDb (April 2000). Kids will love it, and will maybe learn from it's message of non-violence and shaping your own destiny. But, whether you have children or not, I highly recommend this heart-warming and intelligent film. It is so much more than just another feature animation. In The Iron Giant, Warner Bros. has succeeded in avoiding the all too common pitfall of turning an animation into a poor imitation of Disney. They have instead combined their talents to produce a deeper, more intelligent story with a magic that is completely their own.",The Iron Giant

I simply cannot say enough good things about this movie. The animation is incredible, the story, while nothing too revolutionary, serves as a basis for a great message.The movie is filled with some great moments that are cute, while not cloying. The action, such as it is, is handled well and does not glorify violence.Perhaps most refreshing is the lack of wisecracking animal sidekicks and musical numbers that Disney has made so popular.If you're a parent, rent this one for your kids. If you have any amount of childlike wonder remaining in your being, watch this movie. It will not disappoint.",The Iron Giant

354,pl333,A profound art film for kids and a cartoon for intellectuals,10,17 May 2002,"Big time spoilers!Most any Hollywood film can be reduced to a one-sentance description of it's essence.  While the deceptively simple ingredients that made ""the Iron Giant"" could easily have made a typical formula product, such as ""a really cool movie with lots of explosions about a kid who makes friends with a misfit giant robot,"" this film is something profoundly more unique.  The sentance that director Brad Bird used to describe the essence of this film was ""a gun that learns to love.""When the Giant falls from the sky into the life of Hogarth Hughes, it brings with it chaos, war, fear, greed and exploitation.  It is the objectification of the base animal instincts of humanity, posessing unlimited power for technological destruction, but innocent of good or evil like a child.  Nobody knows where it comes from- was it made by the Russians, or god?  Hogarth wants to keep it for himself- Dean, his friend the existentialist beatnik artist, wants to hide it and pretend it doesn't exist- the government wants it destroyed- and Kent Mansley, the main antagonist, has such a competitive lust to conquer it, he'll wreck families, whole towns, and even himself to do it.The conflict climaxes at the point of an impending nuclear strike. But the Giant, programmed as a weapon to destroy what attacks it regardless of any other consequences, has discovered it has a heart, and it chooses to step aside from it's destiny, and sacrifice itself to save from death the people it loves.  It's a jesus-like sacrifice, but instead of serving god's will, this is a choice of free will, a humanist message that's open to interpretation but wonderfully sincere.Where other great films use many of these ingredients- deep psychological insight, mythic-poetic archetypes, socio-political allegory (the cold war), great humor and entertainment (squirrels in the pants)- they might end up being insubstantial if they lack the biggest ingredient in ""the Iron Giant"", heart.  It makes me cry every time I hear the Iron Giant's last words.  Besides those things, it has universal appeal.  As a ""family oriented cartoon"" film with lots of jokes and pop culture references, which was a commecial failure due to executive mismanagement, this film proves that the value of creative expression is independant from terms like ""low art"" and the value measurements of commerce.  It's a work of art first and a commercial product second.  Compared to the current wave of dissatisfyingly hollow, ideologically self-reflexive, corporate-mythmaking computer-generated blockbusters about living toys and dream factories run by friendly monsters, this film should be the standard to judge all future animated features by.",The Iron Giant

We sat there in an almost empty theatre(due to THE IRON GIANT'S infamous bad advertising campaign) on a Saturday afternoon with ZERO anticipation for what we were about to watch for the next hour and a half.What we did see was an indescribable movie going experience. I hadn't been moved by a movie so much in my life let alone a 'cartoon'. The next few weeks was me racing against the clock to get everyone I knew to see it before it's short theatre run was over.

The only reason i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because i honestly think that this film would have had a deeper meaning and more impact if the iron giant stayed dead in the end.  not that i hated his character, rather i think the giant was a great character.  the giant is actually one of the purest and most genuine of characters.  i wouldnt want him dead in real life, but hey this is a movie with deep overtones of social duty and tolerance (also a very fun and entertaining movie too!).  the giant's sacrifice has the potential to bring out the best in all of us, but his rebirth invalidates all that.  his rebirth just lowers the film back to the status of a simple kiddie flick where everything just ends up being good.",The Iron Giant

It's not just a great action movie with great writing it will also touch you on an emotional level as well.

362,Ariamus,The best American animated feature of the last 20 years,9,11 March 2005,"Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece. That movie's success and the subsequent efforts from the same studio ushered in a renaissance of American animation. Megalomaniacal visionary Steve Jobs' belief in a small computer graphics studio, Pixar was directly responsible for the birth of the computer animation feature movie. Their list of accomplishments reads like a who's who and gave impetus to other creative forces to do the same. Since the seminal Toy Story, DreamWorks and Fox, among others, have followed Pixar's lead in that genre of animation. Yet, given Disney's pedigree and Pixar's mastery, one would be incredulous to learn that the best American-made animated movie of the last 20 years was directed by a virtual unknown (at the time) and was distributed (if you can call it that) by Warner Brothers and not any of the aforementioned masters of the art. That movie is the Iron Giant.The story of the Iron Giant is a cross between Beauty and the Beast and ET. It opens in space with a shot of Sputnik panning across the screen and something hurtling from space towards the planet. That something is the title character, a giant robot. Once on earth, the Giant proceeds to dine indiscriminately on the earth's varied cuisine of metal and steel. The Giant is befriended and spared electrocution by a young boy named Hogarth Hughes. The rest of movie tracks the two main characters on their quest to evade detection, have fun, and munch on all the metal that can be had. Along the way, the viewers are treated to a terrific parable about the futility of violence. Set against the backdrop of the early days of the Space Race, the reality of the Cold War helps to contrast the message the movie is sending.The day may be fast approaching where computers and animators can replicate the entire gamut of human emotions and characteristics and render a digital ""actor"" as realistic and compelling as any Academy Award winner. What the computers may not be able to ever do though is replicate the raw emotion that can be discerned from the human voice. In The Iron Giant, the emotions that come to the fore more often are joy, exuberance, and wonder. It is a testament to the actors involved in this feature that the characters are so compelling. Eli Marienthal voices the character of Hogarth with such delight that we can't help but wonder what has gone wrong in our world that we can't feel the same level of enjoyment. The fact that the young Mr. Marienthal is given such tremendous material only helps. Hogarth is an optimistic young man; he thinks the best of everyone and everything and one can't help but wonder if such open-mindedness is as a mechanism erected to keep out the rigors of growing up as a latch-key kid in a single parent home. And, his understanding of death as a part of life makes perfect sense when one considers the fact that this child has been subjected to the ""duck and cover"" instructional in school every year of his short life.If joy and optimism define Hogarth, then wonder defines the Giant. ""Voiced"" by Vin Diesel, the Iron Giant starts off as a enigmatic brute and transforms into an amalgam of childhood, best friend and parental figure. The young thespian gets very few lines of understandable dialog but those that he does get, he delivers with a tenderness that contrasts the mechanical nature of his character.Along with the two protagonists, the rest of the voice work is also excellent. Jennifer Aniston does a good job as Hogarth's single mother, conveying the exasperation a mother must feel when she has to deal with a bright child with an overactive imagination. Harry Connick Jr. is amusing as the beatnik scrap dealer, Dean who Hogarth befriends and who in turn befriends the giant. It goes without say that, given his philosophical tendencies, Dean is the first to accept what Hogarth has to say about the giant's benevolence. Finally, John Mahoney as General Rogard and Christopher McDonald as federal agent, Kent Mansley are also very good. The former comes across as the same sort of caring realist he played in Say Anything without the pen chance for fraud. The latter is positively delicious as a fed that has bought in to all the hype of the Cold War; he is truly drinking the McCarthy Kool Aid. In fact, if he weren't such a despicable guy who does some pretty despicable things, you can almost feel sorry for him.Technically speaking, the Iron Giant pales somewhat when compared to some of the other animated features that are its contemporaries. Even from a traditional animation standpoint, there are contemporaries whose craft stands out more than that of this film. And the main story itself is also simple. What makes this movie terrific is its heart. It gives us characters that we care for, human and otherwise and along the way of the story, it tries to teach it's audience profound lessons on fear and on violence as a solution (or, in this case, non-solution).9 stars out of 10",The Iron Giant

So I decided to watch another Brad Bird's movie, The Iron Giant.It's brilliant, but from the first scene till the end it's a very sneaky communist propaganda. Why sneaky? Because it isn't too explicit, but If you know nothing about Soviet Union (for instance, if you are a kid!), you would think that it's a paradise on Earth. A paradise where people wish to live a different life, but being threatened with nukes by USA.Can someone be so talented in something that it comes on the account on other abilities? Like an ability to read? People didn't live in USSR a different life because they wanted to, definitely not all of them. How one can know that? It's simple: people were executed for just an attempt to leave it (like in any other commie regime in history - what a surprise). Isn't it enough to derive everything else from it?I really love all 3 movies. But after watching The Iron Giant I will not recommend them to anyone, not even Incredibles 2.

It may have changed the way people see the animation genre, but it offers only little. The story itself may not have enough imagination to carry on this movie. Dirty, useless, non-unique are the words to describe its animation. These are the lows of this film but there is more. The highs for the Iron Giant comes to its script and voice acting, but this may also be its weaknesses. It is not too great, it is not too good. But the Iron Giant is a very good sci-fi film, its about a robot helping this boy, it is really a good plot. Unfortunately, the film does not depict this kind of genre, it slows to a kiddie PG cartoon, that's why I did not like this film.

One day, a giant metal man falls from the sky, scaring everybody witless, except Hogarth who befriends the giant and hides him away from the US Army when the investigator is looking for him.The giant - voiced by Vin Diseal - is a beautifully made character who you grow to love more and more as the movie goes on. The end is heartbreaking and the last scene is a fantastic way to end the movie.Laughs are made all the way through the movie and my personal favourite part was when Hogarth was trying to get the giants hand out of the bathroom, in doing so, creating so much noise that his mother and Kurt - the inspector - run upstairs and storm in on him on the toilet.This movie is fantastic and no one should miss the chance to experience such a marvellous film.

367,noxeniv,A rare gem,9,28 February 2015,"The Iron Giant is one of the few animated movies that isn't directly meant for kids. The film, as a whole, is more between the lines of being mature and young. Being in between these lines is what makes the movie more unique. It had a charm while, at the same time, also had subtly dark moments which children may see as odd but an older audience may understand better. Despite that, it is still a movie that anyone can see and still feel something from it. It's an emotional and charming trip through the friendship of a young boy and a giant robot. It is also Vin Diesel at his finest, despite his role being a giant metal man that can barely speak. Eli Marienthal, who plays Hogarth, also did a fantastic job in portraying a rebellious young boy in 1957. The plot also accurately portrays the concerns regarding the 1950's with the Cold War, as it does mention nuclear weapons a couple times in the film.Overall, I would strongly recommend that this movie be watched.

My 4 & 5 year old grand daughters loved it, and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it as well.  The animated characters are generally well developed.  The animation quality is superb and the story is engaging.  It is not overly complex, nor is to too ""preachy"" in delivering its message of non-violence.  I feel it is a rare movie in that it works well on many levels.  If possible, see it in a theater that can properly reproduce the fine audio track which is loaded with low frequency energy.",The Iron Giant
378,djsmall,A Film Gem,10,7 August 1999,"Once in a great while a movie is released that reminds filmgoers just how powerful the medium can be.  ""The Iron Giant"" is one such film.  The fact that it is animated only adds to its magic.  The animation is absolutely superb, strongly rivaling Disney's best.  The screenplay is wonderful, all of the characters are incredibly three-dimensional (something which, alas, I have a difficult time saying about the most recent Disney films), and the voice-over acting is simply the best ever.  The young boy who voiced the character of Hogarth Hughes is a true talent - his voice coupled with Hogarth's animator's drawing prowess gives the audience the best depiction of a young person ever.  Hogarth is very honest and real-to-life, from his innocent romping and make-believe sessions to his deepest and most heartfelt emotions; at no point in the film does director Brad Bird patronize youth. Hogarth is unabashedly human and not a ""boy as he should be"" caricature. Not since Elliot in ""E.T."" has a young character been so real.The character of the Iron Giant is so well drawn - both visually and emotionally - that I often had to remind myself that he was not a living, breathing human being.  In fact, the magic and mystery of this film is the fact that it took a character of cold metal and made it more human than the average person one sees walking down the street.  The Giant is a wonderful symbol of modern man and the beautiful heart that is still within him, albeit buried deeply beneath layers of materialism and aggression.  This movie is a great reminder of man's true nature - ""souls don't die"" - and the possibility that, with the help of the Hogarth Hughes within him, he will discover the Superman he truly is.",The Iron Giant
379,teri70,Take the kids or go alone!!!,10,8 August 1999,"This was an awesome movie!  I don't think I can say that enough.    From the trailer (which doesn't do justice to the movie) I had already decided that I'd have to endure it for an hour and a half simply because the kids wanted to see it.  Thank God for my kids, because without their insisting I would have missed the best animated movie I've seen since Toy Story.  A quarter into the movie I'd already decided to buy the movie the minute it's released on DVD. There's a lot of humor that might be lost on kids, most of it related to period satire.  However, my 4 year old son laughed throughout the movie, and afterward told me ""I'm the good giant robot, Momma"" (Do I see us buying Iron Giant Merchandise? You betcha!)  I felt that the movie was like a nostalgic trip to my own childhood.  I remember when Superman was THE hero to be, and the difference between right and wrong was clearly defined. Finally, in this day and age, who can argue with a movie that advises ""You are what you chose to be."" and with a hero who proudly proclaims, ""I am NOT a gun!""",The Iron Giant

There are no stupid talking animals, no mindless sing alongs and the story manages to get children to do more than want to go and buy the new Tarzan Swing-along alarm clock-phone-thing. I saw the film with many children in the theater, the ending made them cry and then cheer.  The children bonded with the robot and the boy and even the villain in 85 minutes.

383,lei wulong,A very good movie....,10,31 December 1999,"Hmmm, what to say...well....  it was really good.  I've seen it several times, and I've enjoyed it immensely each time for different reasons.
Analytically I find the animation incredible.  The characters are extremely alive and quite realistic, not because of incredible drawing, well, actually, yes: the way the characters are drawn, and animated, is incredible.  From the jerking, swaying and swooshing of body parts to the magnificent and CONSISTENT use of eyes, eyebrows and cheekbones to show real emotions, it's definite that this movie is a masterpiece in terms of animation.  The backgrounds are wonderfully lush, and evoke a wonderful sense of everything that shows fall for the beautiful season it is.  I love animation, and I love good looking landscapes, so the artists behind this movie are making a fan out of me very quickly.I admire (analytically) most of all the enormous apparance of little details in the film: the season sublty changes from fall to winter; the characters are always doing something, even if they aren't directly in focus (the best ad-libbing a director could dream of); I also think in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity (the time and setting of the story help it to make more sense, also, the ""duck and cover"" scene)You know, I think it's amazing when sometimes a movie can move you so much, talking about it's good qualities seems like child's play.  This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and take a long time to get sick of. We all have movies like that, very few can do that to us, but we have them. I'm realising as I write that I like this movie very much, because I've written two or three paragraphs and have not even started talking about the iron giant yet.The animation and expression of emotion in the giant, who is a computer graphics animated character, a hundred feet tall and with a certain old time sci fi persona to him, equals and even surpasses it's traditionally animated companions.  There were scenes in the movie that the giant almost made me cry because of his expressions.  The director, Brad Bird I think, should earn good credit for his work bringing the giant to life.  The giant was very organic and fluid, always animated and extremely alive, without really trying to be. After a while it obvious he's not your average rigid robot.It's hard not to give away details when you write a lot, but thankfully I haven't really given anything away.  I will say this...the movie is about not prejudging things you are unfamiliar with, big or small, and it's about doing what is right and not using gray areas and politics as an excuse not to do the right thing. The movie explores the strange concept of finding friendship, love, and innocence inbetween past guilts and prejudices. It is one of the most well rounded, enriching, thought provoking movies I have seen in my lifetime, and the best part is that it wasn't the visual effects that made me say that...something other feature animation companies have used a a string to lead me on for almost a decade.  I feel like I just recovered from an extended brainwashing experiment.  I've learned my lesson. No longer will movies that use stunning graphics to redeem themselves be an interest to me.  Rather I will watch movies for the messages they give and the depth those movies have. If anything Brad Bird must have tried to make the giant as close in simplicity to the regular animated characters as possible, because you CANNOT tell the difference between CG and traditional in this movie.  Exceptional stuff.I can't imagine anyone I know not liking this movie.  I've shown it to a LOT of people, college students mostly, of all races and religions, with different prides and prejudices, the result, amazingly, always seems to be the same: I have some after movie comments here, and I quote:""Wow!"" ; ""That was NICE!""; ""That was SO...GOOD!"" ;""That giant is crucial, dog!"" ;""It was good...yeah...I liked it!"",; and ""Dang man, that joint TIGHT!"".  If you actually read this review all the way, that's nice. Now forget everything I bumbled about and go see this movie, that way you can spent less time writing your own review than you did reading mine.",The Iron Giant

386,pourrien,A great film for both kids and adults,9,14 September 2000,"""The Iron Giant"" wasn't a big hit in the theaters, but hopefully it will find a larger audience on video, since it deserves one. This is one animated film that doesn't resemble Disney's output very much, which is refreshing. It's just a wonderful story told very well. Set in 1950s Maine, ""The Iron Giant"" is the story of Hogarth Hughes, a bright, only child with an active imagination who is being raised by a single mom. He meets an enormous, child-like robot from outer space who may or may not be a danger to the people of earth. The actors voicing the characters are all great (especially Harry Connick, Jr. as a Beatnik scrap metal dealer), the story is very touching, and the film incorporates just enough reminders of '50s Red-scare paranoia and sci-fi influences without letting them overwhelm the story. This is a great film that viewers of any age should enjoy.",The Iron Giant

The story is pretty simple but that works because of that the characters are able to develop and the themes of anti violence and humanity are present. The giant starts out with amnesia of it's origin but over the course of the story he learns he was built for destruction, after getting electrocuted and rescued by Hogarth the robot becomes more self aware and develops a close bond with the boy. Hogarth shows him he doesn't have to be a gun he can be a hero. The movie ends with the giant sacrificing himself to save everyone from being killed by a missile. I nearly cried for the ending because it was so heavy and depressing but incredibly touching. This movie will pull your heartstrings ! Another thing is the animation is phenomenal!

Because first we have great animations, which of cause is a plus, but then we have the theme about the friendship between the boy and the giant, which makes it wonderful. And the fact that its not just a cute traditional cartoon makes it in to my top-twenty movies. (And I've seen a lot of movies...) But the reason that is so great is that it is simply hilarious.

Technically, this is top-notch film-making.  The CGI was seamless and impressive.  The voice acting was wonderful.  It all added up to a treat for all ages.

It takes state-of-the-art computer graphics, excellent animation, old-school character design, and a compelling and truly modern story. I believe this is based off a book called 'The Iron Giant' or 'The Iron Man' or something. I'm not too sure - never read it.By the production studio _not_ being Disney, it really is a no-holds barred scenario. No cushy wide-eyed animals singing in dewy meadows, or bad guys in epics fights missing every blow almost as it were blatant. No, this movie has an extreme sense of emotion, realism, and feeling I only ever felt in one other animated movie (Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust). The absolute jolt in the `emotional quotient' at the end of this movie is a mental roller coaster, it's a hill you know is there but it 'gets' you every single time.If there is an ""animated movie gauge"" this should be what the rest measure up to.It's a masterpiece.",The Iron Giant
397,dijomaja,The Hero With A Thousand Pieces,10,27 November 2004,"Like all great stories The Iron Giant works on a number of different levels. In the simplest sense, it's a first-rate adventure story for kids with a nice balance of action and humor. There's a ""moral"" to the story but very little actual moralizing and none of the groan-inducing variety. The artwork and the music use familiar elements without falling into cliché. But there's more. The Iron Giant also works as a re-telling of myth, combining elements as old as storytelling itself. In Joseph Campbell's landmark book, The Hero With A Thousand Faces, he shows how certain themes are constantly recurring in mythology, religion, psychology and literature. Campbell's work leans heavily on the writings of Carl Jung, who believed that these ideas are part of our human heritage and understood on a deeper level (often without our awareness). While this may seem like a lot of baggage to be strapping onto 90 minutes of family entertainment, it works. Furthermore, poet Ted Hughes, the writer of the story on which the film is (loosely) based, knew his mythology as well.While a small book could be written on the themes running through The Iron Giant it's important to avoid the ""this = that"" sort of allegory found in Cliff Notes and high school English courses. The giant does not ""stand for"" this or that figure in religion or myth. There are elements of Osiris, the Egyptian figure whose body is scattered and re-assembled and Iron John, from the European folk tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and the subject of Robert Bly's generally misunderstood book. There are lots of interesting twists on the classic themes. The character of ""Dean"" functions partly in the Iron John role and partly as the Old Wise Man. This figure is often a wizard in folklore (think of Merlin or Gandalf) but the writers turned him into a twenty-something Beatnik sculptor. The list goes on and we haven't even mentioned Hogarth. If this all seems a bit too much like a Required Reading list or a homework assignment ignore this and see the movie. If, however, this all sounds interesting, read Joseph Campbell and see the movie. Ten or twelve times.",The Iron Giant

Probably the best animated effort I have seen in recent memory, and with two young kids and an enjoyment for good animated movies myself - I have seen a lot of them. I hope Disney is taking notes - can't remember the last time I heard applause at the end of one of their movies.
This is a fantastic show for any child this summer and a must see for us baby-boomers.When I went to the preview last night with my wife and two boys (age 8 and 5) I hadn't seen much press and didn't know what to expect. The boys laughed along and got caught up in the suspense & emotion as did the whole audience. We loved the story and I got a kick out of some of the memories of the day (duck and cover...).

An animated flick with no musical numbers, no cute little animal sidekicks, blood, and a couple ""damn""s, ""hell""s and even a ""screw""?  Overall, I think it worked fairly well.  Nice animation, retro-design characters, simple but sophisticated plot, and just the right touch of visual humor, e.g. the robot mimicking the child's postures, the detached hand running amok through the house, etc.  Ignore the preachy anti-gun message (which was, by the way, lost on the younger kids in the audience - my four year old thought the iron giant was cool because ""he had all those guns that could blow up tanks""), and you have yourself one very entertaining movie.  Maybe they could have made the moral more reasonable, i.e. ""gun's can be good if used defensively"", but I guess that would have (** spoiler alert!! **) made the ending far less dramatic -  a blast from one of the robot's lasers would probably have sufficed.I saw ""Iron Giant"" a few weeks after release, and the theater was, sadly, almost empty.  Word-of-mouth and critic reviews have been very good, so I guess we would have to chalk it up to poor marketing.  Hope this doesn't sour Hollywood on an alternative to the standard Disney formula.Its no ""Beauty and the Beast"", but I would still give it a solid 7.5/10. Runs circles around any non-Disney animation I have seen yet.",The Iron Giant
416,filgate,A Wonderful Movie that doesn't deserve to fail,10,9 August 1999,"Unlike the animated bombs that Warner Brothers has released over the last two years, the Iron Giant does not deserve to fail. Unfortunately, it seems that Warner Brothers thought that it would, and therefore didn't put any effort into promotion. I saw the film the day that it came out, and I was so taken with it that I had to have a memento of some kind. But there was nothing. No books, no toys, no posters. Except for an advertising campaign that seems to have peaked two weeks ago, publicity has been almost zilch.All of this is a shame, because this is the best animated film I have seen in years. Brad Bird has crafted a fully realized world from the fifties, and set it in the animation style familiar to those times. There are shades of Lady and the Tramp in the large lines and fluid movement that the human characters exhibit. More telling than any technical aspect, though(including the amazing computer-generated giant), is the script. This is a beautiful one. Simple enough for children, but aimed at adults, the movie had everyone in the sparsely populated movie theatre laughing and cheering.This movie should be seen by everyone it can. It's a shame that a story this wonderful can be ruined by a simple lack of promotion.",The Iron Giant
417,K'Hack,Gushing praise for best animated film in years!,10,8 December 1999,"This was my most favorite movie that I have seen the past 5 - 10 years. Superb animation, excellent choice in voice actors, music was cool and totally hip. Loved the 'bot. Ever so 50's. Great pacing, extremely emotional. This is how an animated film should be done. The ""big boys"" should be paying attention.For a movie to have me say to my fellow macho movie attendees in the theater, ""I'm not gonna cry... I'm not gonna cry"" as the movie approached its powerful climax, well.... 'nuff said. It made the adult in me feel like a kid all over again.This film is a keeper for the DVD or video collection. All hail Brad Bird and his crack team. They made me a happy man.I just want to know why Warner Brothers didn't give this film the publicity it deserved. They dropped the ball on this one!",The Iron Giant

419,alexalyn,Better every time I see it,10,23 October 2000,"I was skeptical of ""The Iron Giant"" when I sat down to watch it for the first time a few months ago.  My attitude had been ""If it isn't a Disney film, it can't be that good, can it?""Oh, yes, it can.  This is definitely the best animated film I have seen in years.  The characters were realistic, the animation was beautiful, and the plot was good enough to hold my three year-old's attention as well as my own.  And I figure that, eventually, I will be able to watch the ending without bawling.  Also, I liked the anti-gun message behind the film, and how simply it was rendered.Do yourself a favor.  Even if you ""don't like cartoons,"" give this one a shot.",The Iron Giant

At the same time, the reviews were so enthusiastic that I was skeptical. I expected it to be, at the very least, entertaining. What I got was more than entertaining. It was truly a thing of beauty. I was sucked into, and swept away by this film, more than ever before. I have never been so emotionally affected by a movie in my entire life. While I certainly understand that not everybody will get as much out of it as I did, I know that this was one of the single best films that I have ever seen. You owe it to yourself to see this movie!",The Iron Giant

It's a vast departure from what people who've only been exposed to Disney are used to getting from their animated movies; no animal sidekicks, no musical numbers. It's extremely well-written and directed, with anime-quality animation. An extraordinary film...",The Iron Giant

Take your friends, take your family, take a stranger... you will not regret it.",The Iron Giant
425,Goldmund-3,High-water mark for animated films,10,8 August 1999,"Simply put, this is the finest animated film I've seen.  Hell, this is almost a perfect movie.  Everyone employed at Disney should be forced to watch this film and rediscover what it is to create a film with real soul and emotion.  The characters in this film (especially Hogarth) truly came to life up on the screen.  The voice acting for all parts was superb. Hogarth is the first ""child actor"" that hasn't annoyed me in any way for quite some time.  While the moral message may be too heavy handed for some, this is simply a milestone film that shouldn't be passed up.",The Iron Giant

I've never seen such emotion portrayed in the animated format! It's one thing to make drawings move realistically. Disney and others can all do that! But these guys, they made their drawings think and act! They really came to life before my eyes! I actually felt sorry for the robot! I walked out of the theater with a new perspective on life!I'm disappointed by one thing only: the fact that this movie will surely pass from the box office within the next few weeks. Nobody is watching it! The movie's making absolutely NO money! (well, that's according to hollywood's standards)GO OUT AND SEE THIS MOVIE!

428,supergav,Don't miss this movie...,10,9 August 1999,"Warner Bros have done a great job at not promoting this movie.However as all the other comments testify it is a ""must see"". It is the first animation I have seen for a long time that is not condescending to adults or children. It is a beautiful, well-told, moral STORY. Yes, a real story and a message. It is suitable for just about all ages.The animation is not quite up to recent Disney/DreamWorks efforts - but this is a minor point given that overall the movie works so well.This movie gives me faith that Hollywood can still make films worth seeing. 9 1/2 out of 10",The Iron Giant
429,Brandon-35,A magnificent movie.,10,11 August 1999,"This is a wonderfully satisfying movie.  Everything is on spot.  The humor, the personalities of the characters, and the surprisingly sophisticated moral message. I have never felt so satisfied and so eager to see a movie again, since I saw the original Star Wars.I only hope that others notice this movie and pass the word along. It is apparently doing very badly in the box office, and I fear that if it bombs, animation companies might steer clear of this level of movie-making If you've not already seen this movie, then I urge you to watch it. If you have seen the movie, then you're already telling everybody about how great it is.",The Iron Giant

I can't ever remember a film that made me want to run back to the theater ASAP and see it again.

431,SilentSteve,"""What if a gun had a soul and chose not to be a weapon?""",10,30 August 1999,"""What if a gun had a soul and chose not to be a weapon?""That is the one sentence summery of ""The Iron Giant"" that director Brad Bird uses to capsule the concept of his new film. I saw it last night and my head has been so busy with thinking about it that I just had to sit down and send a quick note to my friends to let you know how wonderful a movie it is. It has so much love and care put into every frame and it shows. The characters are nicely fleshed out, the voice performances are wonderful, the themes of the film are so seamlessly sewn into story that it never feels preachy and most importantly, it is 100% entertaining. I went into the movie with extremely high expectations having heard others rave about it. I felt sure that I would be let down some because of the hype. Not for a moment. I was pulled in from frame one and was taken into this little boy's world until the very end. It does not pander to kids and it does not try to be cleaver with a wink-of-the-eye towards adults. The message that this story, set in Maine in 1957, brings to America in 1999 cannot be ignored.You do not need a child to accompany you to see this film but when I walked out of the theatre I was trying to think of nieces, nephews, neighbor kids, or anyone who could provide me an excuse to see it again. If you were already going to see ""The Iron Giant"" (or have already seen it) that is great. However, if reading this has put you one step closer to seeing a film that you were going to pass on then I am glad.",The Iron Giant

Kudos to Brad Bird and his team of animators. This is the best animated film to come out of an alternate studio since Secret of NIMH (not counting PIXAR's two efforts).The animation reminds me of 101 Dalmatians, and is a nice departure from what we've been seeing in animation lately. The script is smart, funny and tugs at the heart.Go and see this movie or you won't see more like it. The fate of the WB feature animation unit will be decided on the results from this movie and at this point it doesn't look good, despite the nearly unanimous great reviews.",The Iron Giant
433,Meggie02,This is definitely one of my favorite movies.,10,13 August 1999,"I really liked this movie. I would have to call it one of the best animated films ever. Yes, I'm including those made by Disney too. Now, I love Disney movies, don't get me wrong, but this movie has a different quality to it. Instead of having song-and-dance numbers, or slap-stick animal characters, it's just a movie. It's like a normal live-action type movie, but everything is drawn instead. I love the medium of animation, because you can do so much with it. The special effects blended much better with the hand-drawn animation in this movie, then I've seen anywhere else. In many recent animated movies, it seems like the characters are drawn into a background where they don't belong, or even fit in. This movie has restored my faith in Warner Brothers Animation. The story was wonderful, the voice artistry wasn't over-done, and the animation was nearly flawless. This movie is definitely one that everyone can enjoy without feeling as if they're watching a ""kiddie"" movie. What are you waiting for? Go see it before it's gone!",The Iron Giant
434,leda-3,Glorious,10,14 August 1999,"I love good children's films.  They are one of the few genres left where writers, actors, and directors feel safe to tell a story in ways that honor both an audience's intelligence and desire for entertainment.  I loved *Charlotte's Web,* I loved *Babe,* I loved *Fly Away Home* and now I'm happy to love *The Iron Giant,* which goes on my shelf to have on hand whenever my friends, both children and adult, come for a night at the movies at my home.As we were leaving the theater, my friend said ""I wish it'd been made 20 years ago"" and I agree.  At the suggestion that the family find a fallout shelter once the nuclear missile is aimed at the Giant, Dean sadly replies that ""It doesn't matter...no shelter can protect us.""  And Hogarth tells his friend ""We're all going to die.""  Using the old ""duck and cover"" cartoon is brilliant: what a contrast between that moment of boundless optimism, and the end, when reality hits!  For that reason, and for the love that so evident here between all the major characters, I wish I'd grown up with this movie.  In an ever more violent America, I wish there was just one other release this year with a line like ""You choose who you are.  You can choose *not to be a gun.*""  One of my favorite films this year.",The Iron Giant
435,Dr.Drake,"Run, don't walk to see it!",10,15 August 1999,"The Iron Giant is without a doubt the best, most intelligent animated feature from America since Fantasia. The single best endorsement I can think of is that when I drug a friend to see it at a matinee showing last week, there a bunch of kids in the theatre directly behind us. Not only did my friend ( a 37 year old pharmacist), really enjoy it, the kids really loved it too. The story isn't ""dumbed down"" in any way, it doesn't insult an adult's ( or a kid's either) intelligence by resorting to cutesy comic sidekicks  i.e. Jar Jar Binks, Terk, or Scrappy Doo. The Iron Giant is just flat-out a good movie that happens to be animated.",The Iron Giant
436,astroman-5,a brilliant alternative to Disney,9,15 August 1999,"In many respects, ""The Iron Giant"" has a lot in common with another excellent film that came out earlier this year, ""October Sky."" Both films are set in the same year and feature the beginnings of the space race and the dawn of the atomic age as their respective backdrops to the main action. Each movie features young protagonists who are dreamers and outsiders of their societies and present refreshingly peaceful resolutions to their respective conflicts.""The Iron Giant"" has a wonderful nostalgic, small-town atmosphere that is brought to life by the stunning animation that is on par with anything that Disney has produced recently. The attention to period detail, from the cheesy educational videos that Hogarth's class is forced to watch, to the way townspeople talk, is faithfully recreated and really goes a long way to drawing you into this engaging world. In some respects, the animation style of this film recalls the early, groundbreaking Fleischer brothers Superman cartoons of the 1940s with its depth of field, but without the German Expressionist influence.The real strength of this film is the relationships between the characters -- something that is often overlooked in animated films for flashy visuals and epic musical numbers. ""The Iron Giant"" has the feel of a very intimate, character-driven film with the relationship between Hogarth and his robot friend as the emotional centre but with several other relationships (like the ones between Hogarth and his mother and between him and Dean) also featured prominently as well. This is no simple Saturday morning cartoon but a strong feature film that actually has something to say.""The Iron Giant"" is one of those rare animated films that appeals to both children and adults, that doesn't contain one annoying musical number a la Disney, and that isn't one long advertisement for a toy. In fact, this film is an entertaining, even touching, story about tolerance and compassion. ""The Iron Giant"" refuses to talk down to its audience (the usual tactic of most animated films) or spoonfeed them any answers. It also deals with real issues like death and bigotry -- pretty heavy topics for a children's animated film.easily one of THE best animated films i've ever seen...",The Iron Giant
437,JWR,A Giant Classic!,10,16 August 1999,"I have been dumbstruck by the lack of attention this gem of a movie has been getting.  It is easily the best animated movie I have seen since Beauty and the Beast and the best movie I have seen this year.  It accomplishes this by setting out on a different trek from Disney.  The story is kept moving along without the now obligatory song and dance routines and goofy sidekicks perfected by the Mouse.  Instead the animators rely on a carefully crafted script and characterization.  The main morals of the movie are ""You are what you choose to be"" and an anti-violence message that seem particularly pertinant in this year of classroom horrors.  As the director Brad Bird has said ""what if a gun had a soul and chose not to be a gun.""  Overall, a stirring and timely classic that will stay with viewers long after they have left the theatre.  I dare say, worthy of Oscar recognition for best picture of the year.  Not to be missed!",The Iron Giant
438,Scary-10,Wonderful film!,10,18 August 1999,"What a treat this film is! For those baby boomers who grew up on B&W 1950s Sci-Fi flicks and who spent their days with comic books folded up and stuck in their back jeans pockets, this is a must-see film.  Long-time comic book fans, especially, will be thrilled by some of the images and story points. And oh yeah -- kids will love it too!It's a good-hearted, honest, witty, well-written, well-directed, beautifully drawn film that works for all ages.  What more could you want?
I understand it is NOT doing great box office business, and that is a crying shame -- as it is clearly one of the best films of the year, and those who ARE seeing it are loving it.

Oh I'm sure that it will get nominated in the Animated Feature category, but I doubt we're going to see this film's name in either of the categories where it belongs - Best Screenplay and Best Picture.  The sad thing is that this is probably more likely going to be due to a lack of an attempt on the part of Warner Brothers to push the film as a Best Picture/Screenplay nominee than on the unwillingness of the Academy to nominate it in those categories.  Warner Brothers will I'm sure make at least a token effort to outperform Disney's ""Tarzan"" marketing juggernaut, but I won't be suprised if it doesn't even occur to the powers that be to float this as a Best Picture/Screenplay contender.That said, the Iron Giant is, without a doubt, the best film of 1999, and probably one of the 10 best stories ever told on film.  The animation is typical Disney-esque fare, and if there are technical categories for animated features there's no reason to think that IG should win an award in one.  What carries this film is the writing, both story and screenplay, and wonderfully performed voice acting.  Take special note of Vin Diesel (yeah...Vin Diesel) as the Iron Giant.  I don't know how much easier voice acting might be than regular acting, but in this case, Diesel nails it.There's the usual spate of grown-up jokes thrown in to keep adults entertained, and the robot's Cool Quotient is right up there with iMacs.But when you get down to it it's the simple yet perfectly told story that make this film great to watch.",The Iron Giant

Fortunately, it also makes one realize how wonderful movies can be.  The Iron Giant does not have an extravaganza of special effects (a'la The Prince of Egypt), yet still is visually magnificent.  It does not have a plethora of sound-alike songs written by a big name in sound-alike songwriting, instead it has a pleasant background of songs true to the setting.  It does  not have the ""Disney Romance,"" a major relief.  Most importantly, The Iron Giant does not talk down to its audience.  The characters had multiple dimensions to their personalities, a feature rarely given to animated characters, details of real people (note Hogarth's crooked tooth), and even *gasp* realistic dialogue.  The Iron Giant  even has a good moral, something I can't seem to find in most other animated features. I can only hope to see more movies as worthy as this one.",The Iron Giant

When I was near tears at the end I realized that I should have caught this one in the theaters, or at least in letterbox edition.The story is a basic formula, and been done a 1000 times, but never with this grace, style and sense of timing.  The comedy is pushed to it's absolute limit, another joke could not be pushed in anywhere without disturbing your flow through the story.  Which is one of the most beautiful parts.  You can't help but love the characters as you laugh with them.This is no Disney movie (it's better), and parents should really be careful showing this to their kids.  The comments it makes on American society, especially on the mentality of America in the 1950s, are rather harsh and blatant.This movie should be up for the Editing, Directing and Screenwriting Oscars'.

As I started to watch I was thinking oh well another cheesy scifi cartoon but, as I got into it I noticed little things that made it different from other movies of the like. As in the simple way Hogarth goes through a daily routine and as a child of the 50's I was taken by the way things in his life were similar to mine. Only one parent, dreams of a being from outer space coming to earth and being his only friend and influence. Being the center of attention as an only child. The Giant and his way of getting inside of you and wanting him to be only yours. A true friend to be sure. I was swept up in this film in about 10 minutes. I was Hogarth. I felt everything he felt. I was taken with how the animators came up with the different weapons at his disposal, and that the Giant was basically a peaceful soul thrown into a situation he didn't ask for.

Drips with quality. Good character animation, and some very clever use of cinematics. I wanted to see this one at the movies when it came out, but didn't. I could have sat through it, I thought, but dragging the kids along seemed a bit far fetched, so I give it a miss.I am very glad I eventually saw it on video. Do you want to know who chose the film?My 4½ year old son. We watched it together and both thoroughly enjoyed the experience.I just loved it when the Giant lets loose against the threatening forces. That scene was a little strong for my nipper, but he could sit through it as I was beside him.I am looking forward to seeing it again one day./Soup",The Iron Giant
458,desenhorsc,The most amazing cartoon ever!!,10,12 August 2001,"This is a movie that has something that lacks in almost every single movie in the last five years, and that´s heart. Hogarth is a kid, a kid like you would imagine your grandfather was, from a long forgotten past and is suddenly playing in your tv. He has no barriers, because his imagination can take him anywhere... And the same goes for Brad Bird, the director of this animation epic that can thrill you, like in the confrontation between the Giant and the Army or touch you deep inside your heart... There is no way someone can keep their eyes dry or a smile from showing in the face in the ending, when we see that the sacrifice that one robot did for humankind wasn´t without it´s reward.BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",The Iron Giant
459,BenDaviesDynamicDynamite,I am not a gun,10,18 November 2020,"There are few films to this day that can move me.Not that other films don't make me feel things or not put me at the edge of my seat but not a lot of those films move me or change me in a way that leaves a forever lasting impression.The Iron Giant is a plain and simple story:
Boy meets alien robot and the government are trying to stop said alien robot.Never-mind the other side plots and themes like the 50's era Cold War paranoias and how that effected the masses or how 60's culture was coming in and promoting more peace and creative freedom despite the wars and debates that were brewing.Its a story about how a boy taught an ET how to be human and then it became more human than the government chasing them. A boy who taught a weapon to be more than that and in the end it was.The scene with the Iron Giant's last words are always gonna stick with me and it has shaped me into the person who I hope to be, I want to be a good person and I will try to be true to who I am regardless of what the world wants and told me to be.Thank you, Brad Bird and all those involved.",The Iron Giant

Every boy wants to be the Hogarth, Every man, to be Dean. Every one wants to hate Kent, and all that that implies.Whether you relate to Hogarth, his mother Annie, the beatnik Dean or the General, you will find a reason to relate to this movie. The stereotypes from the 1950s America are not so blatant as to make this movie stilted. It pulls off the era with the same smooth aplomb as Back to the Future. The staging is professional, the soundtrack excellent. The only tragedy is that they did not go on to make more with this tight production team.Watch with your son, with your father, with your heart.",The Iron Giant

It has you weeping one moment, and laughing at the antics of Hogarth and The Iron Giant the next. It is definitely on my list of top ten best movies of all timeThe best scene is near the end when the Iron Giant is flying up in the sky, and he says, ""Superman"" It almost made me weep.If you want to watch an animated movie not just made for kids, and with more heart than most movies out there, this is the one. If more movies were made like this one, more people would see movies in theaters, instead of the crap that comes out of theaters lately, like all of the sequels and comebacks to the theater, like rocky and Rambo.",The Iron Giant

To this day i considered Lion King the greatest animated film of all time...until last night. I always remember seeing Iron Giant advertised but never bothered to watch it. Last night I was blown away! I usually put something on for background viewing while I go to sleep but Iron Giant had me hooked. I was naive thinking this was just a kids film. The animation is beautiful, the story is gripping and the characters are genuinely believable. When I saw that the film had a backdrop of the cold War I was surprised but its made so well that even in this modern age of over sensitivity it can't be criticised any sane or rational individual.",The Iron Giant

I am so captivated by the ending of this movie. Great ending, but needs a sequel, however not a cheesy one where they have to fight aliens on another planet and make it luney or anything, something that slowly reveals the origins of the giant, and how he ended up on earth and such. Also, I noticed some anti-gun feelings, but then again, would it be a good children's movie if he boy said guns are good? Give me a break. Fantastic Movie BTW, people give this movie bad reviews, but then again, I never like ANY of the StarWars Movies, so different people have different tastes.",The Iron Giant
465,cat_wolf_dog,Please do this film justice Brad Bird: Make a direct to DVD sequel at the very least,9,23 February 2008,"I still remember when I first saw this. I was 6, and one day my father came to me after work and said,""Do you want to go see the Iron Giant with your brother and me?"" Naturally seeking any opportunity to spend time with him (my folks divorced when I was about 2), I accepted and saw the movie later that night. If only you could go back to a specific time, and experience it all over again.I was in awe at the film, from the time the squirrel ran up Dean's pants to the tear-jerking end where The Giant despaired over nearly losing Hogarth, went on a rampage, and in the end, made the decision that he was not a gun. That he could choose who he wanted to be, despite being sent to Earth with the previous intention of destruction, and sacrificed himself for the town. When I saw The Giant fly to the bomb, utter the word,""superman"", and close his eyes, I broke into tears.I couldn't stop talking about it afterwards. My brother and I obsessed over it on the ride home, and I mentally mulled it over in my mind that night. Now, about 9 years later, I saw it on the movie listings on the TV, turned it on for my 7 month old brother while I cleaned the front room, and my awe was rekindled all over again. Such life lessons about violence, decisions, and finding out who you are, is very rare for a child's movie.My heart twisted at seeing The Giant's familiar act at the end. Right after I went on the net, and found out that it was a financial failure way back when.What a horrible shame.I gave this a 9/10 because the guns kill people message got abit corny once or twice in the film, but that was the only real problem with this great movie. At least in my humble opinion.I recommend this movie for all ages, and if you haven't seen it, please do for your sake.May more movies like this come into existence.",The Iron Giant

As a matter of fact i've started to value anime above the others kind of works like disney, pixar etc. But this movie... This is the perfect animation movie ever made. The humour, the emotion, pearls of wisdom, style of draw, the music... This movie has everything. This movie is everything.

472,robiulaminakash,"The ""solid"" heart",9,19 October 2016,"Imagine ""E.T."" as a towering metal man, and you have some of the appeal of ""The Iron Giant,"" an enchanting animated feature about a boy who makes friends with a robot from outer space. The giant crash-lands on a 1957 night when America is peering up at the speck of Sputnik in the sky, and munches his way through a Maine village, eating TV antennas and cars, until he finds a power plant. That's where young Hogarth Hughes finds him.Hogarth is a 9-year-old who lives with his single mom (Jennifer Aniston) and dreams of having a pet. She says they make too much of a mess around the house, little dreaming what a 100-foot robot can get up to. One night Hogarth discovers their TV antenna is missing and follows the Iron Giant's trail to the power plant, where he saves the robot from electrocution after it chomps on some live wires. That makes the giant his friend forever, and now all Hogarth has to do is keep the robot a secret from his mom and the federal government.""The Iron Giant"" is still another example of the freedom that filmmakers find in animation: This would have been a $100 million live-action special-effects movie, but it was made for a fraction of that cost because the metal man is drawn, not constructed. And here is a family movie with a message: a Cold War parable in which the Iron Giant learns from a little boy that he is not doomed to be a weapon because ""you are what you choose to be."" The movie is set in the 1950s because that's the decade when science fiction seemed most preoccupied with nuclear holocaust and invaders from outer space. It includes a hilarious cartoon version of the alarming ""Duck and Cover"" educational film, in which kids were advised to seek shelter from H-bombs by hiding under their desks. And the villain is a Cold Warrior named Kent Mansley (voice by Christopher McDonald), a G-man who of course sees the Iron Giant as a subversive plot and wants to blast it to pieces.That political parable is buried beneath a lot of surface charm; the film's appeal comes from its ""E.T.""-type story about a boy trying to hide an alien from his mom. The Iron Giant is understandably too big to conceal in the closet, but there's a funny sequence where Hogarth brings the creature's hand into the house, and it scampers around like a disobedient dog.Like the new Japanese animated films, ""The Iron Giant"" is happy to be a ""real movie"" in everything but live action. There are no cute little animals and not a single musical number: It's a story, plain and simple. The director, Brad Bird, is a ""Simpsons"" veteran whose visual look here, much more complex than ""The Simpsons,"" resembles the ""clear line"" technique of Japan's Hayao Miyazaki (""My Neighbor Totoro""). It works as a lot of animation does, to make you forget from time to time that these are moving drawings, because the story and characters are so compelling.As for the Iron Giant himself, he's surprisingly likable. He can't speak English at first, but is a quick study, and like E.T. combines great knowledge with the naivete of a stranger in a puzzling land. His voice is by Vin Diesel and sounds like it has been electronically lowered. He looks unsophisticated--something like a big Erector Set construction with a steam-shovel mouth--but as we get to know him he turns into a personality before our very eyes--a big lunk we feel kind of sorry for. By the big climax (which, also like ""E.T.,"" involves a threat from bureaucrats and technocrats), we're hoping Hogarth can help save his friend once again.It must be tough to get a movie like this made. Disney has the traditional animation market locked up, but other studios seem willing to throw money at Disney musical look-alikes (like ""The King and I"") even though they might have a better chance moving in the opposite direction--toward real stories told straight. ""The Iron Giant,"" based on a book by the recently deceased British poet laureate Ted Hughes, is not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.",The Iron Giant

Childhood, friendship, love, respect for life, family, this movie moved me in so many ways. It is very funny, and so innocently heart-warming, with a deep message about faith, love, and sacrifice, carefully woven into the story. It is something when an animated film makes you laugh, but when it can make you cry too....that is fantastic. The cinematography is excellent and I felt the subtleties of the music also contributed so much to emotion of this film. Also, the acting was fantastic, there was great depth to all the main characters which made them very real to me. This film can definitely be appreciated by young and old.

475,cheetor96,A childhood movie at its best!,10,22 May 2014,"When I first heard about this film, I did not know what to expect from Warner Brothers.Don't get me wrong, I loved the old Bugs Bunny cartoons but for WB to make an animated film that is based off a book seems a little unusual from my point of view.By the time I saw it on video( I didn't see it theaters, though)it blew me away! The animation is very nice, the characters are interesting, the story is well played out but I believe the one character that steals the show is the giant himself.He is very innocent yet he has no memory where he came from or who created him, but the friendship between the kid and the robot is very satisfying to look at. He learns so many thing from the kid himself but the one lesson he taught the giant is ""You are who you chose to be"".I won't give away the ending but I will say it is beautifully emotional it will leave anyone in tears. Overall, I say this is worth watching and people should give this a watch every once in a while.",The Iron Giant

Great story, wonderful characters, the Iron Giant is amazing!SPOILERS: I had tears in my eyes when we saw that the Iron Giant had survived the bomb and only really powerful movies can do that to me! Watching the parts return to him in Iceland was a powerful scene and perfect ending. The Iron Giant was such a nice and gentle character despite his massive iron body. The relationship between he and Hogarth was perfect.

Imagine you going to a place you never been before and people shoot rockets at you because they believe you are a danger to their society. Now ask your self this, If you were in the Giant's shoes would you have still sacrificed yourself? Be honest with yourself do not give an answer because you think it is what I want to hear. None the less if you have never seen this movie, please consider renting it or buying. Also sit your kid down (if you have one) and watch with him/her. It is a great movie, till this day I cry.

It's one of those rare films that I would not mind watching multiple times in a day, even though I must admit that there are tear inducing scenes that gets me everytime.This film ought to be on the Imdb top 250, I'd like to think, and I think everyone from child to adult should watch it at least once; it's a movie one can appreciate in all stages of life, and if you watched it during childhood it will likely be a source of nostalgia for years to come.

Maybe the creators of the iron giant would come looking for him because he hasn't reported back to them about conquering the earth! In the mean time the giant is coming back together and returns to Hogarth's place just in time to confront his creators to try to get them to back off from their pursuit of world domination. Or he could come back in time to prevent another alien race from coming and doing the same to earth. I don't know how or who will write the sequel but I sure wish someone would.

486,dromader2001,Open hearted one,10,2 August 2006,"Here we have over four hundred comments on the film already, so, to save your time, I am lining up with those who said the animation is a really good one, adding personally that it resembles not those usual Dysney things often considered over here in Russia the only kind the Americans can do, but the good old kind Soviet multiki of my childhood. So, let ""The Iron Giant"" have the 10/10.Why, we got used to being shown bunches of evil aliens, menacing robots and maniac Russians (what a pity)... and this animation is a nice change. Not so evil aliens, a goodwill robot and such a lovely sputnic right in the beginning... yeah, we did it first ;-DRating it 10/10 doesn't mean this multfilm is ideal but only proves I liked it to the extent of caring about its plot twists, animation quality, minor bugs etc. Surely you would be right saying 'tis highly subjective. No surprise: I have a fancy for robots, aliens and Russians... for some of them for sure.Watching this animation you (and, of course, your kids, if there are any) hardly would want to search for mismatches or glitches or whatever as it has the features of a tale when you are not forced to believe, to stick to realism, but you take the story close, and it has some deep honest overtones. The movie is rather laconic and inspiring as you are let to guess the characters' background, is really humorous, no cheap jokes, no sugar, definite style, the 1950's atmosphere; I assure you, you need not to be even American or a comics fan to appreciate it.And though I disapprove, err, the total gun abstinence, even in the dire need of defense (that is a bit too of satiagraha, or orthodox Christianity, eh?), I pity most that watched this seven year old movie only yesterday.",The Iron Giant

This was the first movie that my son and I actually enjoyed watching together.This movie should be a defining standard to measure all other children's movies against. It has excellent animation, voice acting, and humor. It also has the added benefit of a responsible plot line that teaches the danger of weapons and becoming your own person.
