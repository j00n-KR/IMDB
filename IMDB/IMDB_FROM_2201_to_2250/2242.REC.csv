0,Leofwine_draca,One of the best horror movies out there,10,24 October 2016,"Wow! What else is there to say about this timely Spanish zombie flick which has fallen in with the recent crowd of 'camcorder' horror flicks like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT(which started the trend, of course), CLVOERFIELD, and the virtually-the-same DIARY OF THE DEAD? It's an absolutely terrifying effort that reminds us once again that there's no need for CGI effects or anything else when it comes to true startling horror – just trap a bunch of people in an apartment building and let the fun begin! I had high hopes for this film beforehand – I purchased it sight unseen which is unusual for me – and they were all fulfilled during this roller-coaster ride of terror.Of course it's zombie action as usual, with plenty of jumpy moments as survivors are whittled down and the blood flows freely. Where the film is most frightening is in the suspense bits which are unbearably atmospheric – the bit in the penthouse at the end, for instance, or the staircase scenes. It helps that the cast is uniformly excellent, especially Manuela Velasco who transforms from sassy reporter to woman-in-peril with utmost believability. The crew are also very good indeed and these Spaniards sure show Hollywood folk how it's done – this blows away pretty much everything to come out of America in the past few years. In the end, REC is so good because it's well-plotted and expertly scripted, with the story always unfolding as the running time goes on. It's far from just the typical survival horror movie in which characters are picked off as if on a rota. Well drawn folk experience real terror and we're there along for the ride, desperately wishing we weren't. This film scared me and I loved every moment of it – and can't wait to see it again!",REC
1,SnoopyStyle,Good horror,7,7 September 2013,"This is a somewhat innovative Spanish horror film. A TV reporter and her cameraman doing a report on firefighters follow a call to an apartment building where something is wrong. People are turning into zombies, and the authorities seal them in.The camera style is Blair Witch inspired. For this, it works quite well. It adds energy to the movie. However I did find it somewhat tiresome after a while. As with all these hand-held camera style, there's always the illogicality of how the camera is always catching the action just right. The other problem I had was how the building was sealed so quickly. Overall, those are minor details. This horror film had some pretty good shots. It's able to maintain the pace, and get to a climatic ending.",REC
2,claudio_carvalho,Claustrophobic and Scary,8,20 January 2009,"In Barcelona, the reporter Ángela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) and the cameraman Pablo (Pablo Rosso) are covering the night-shift of local fire station. When the firemen receive a distress call from a lady in a building, Ángela and Pablo go in the firefighter truck with the firemen Manu (Ferran Terraza) and Álex (David Vert) with Pablo recording each step. When they arrive in the building under siege of the police, they find the hysterical dwellers gathered in the lobby in the entrance and they hear screams upstairs. Manu and Álex go upstairs with two policemen and followed by Ángela and Pablo, and they find an aggressive old lady that attacks one policeman with several bites. When they return to the lobby, they find that they are sealed in the building and trapped with the residents claiming for an explanation and dreadful screams upstairs in the beginning of a chaotic and nightmarish night.The claustrophobic and scary ""Rec"" uses the same style of ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Cloverfield"" and ""Diary of the Dead"", with the story disclosed through the lens of a camcorder. However, on the contrary of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Diary of the Dead"", this movie works perfectly giving an incredible realism and atmosphere to the plot and discomfort to the viewers. The acting is top-notch with an amazing cast and the pace is perfect. This awesome movie certainly is one of the best zombie movies I have ever seen. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Rec"" (IMDb does not accept square brackets)",REC
3,nogodnomasters,BETTER THAN QUARANTINE,6,8 April 2019,"To say this is the movie on which quarantine would be incorrect. Quarantine is a remake of this movie, down to the last scene. I wish I had never seen Quarantine before I watched this film as it ruined it. What makes this movie better is that there is less lame build up time at the fire department. I have a prejudice against these stupid cheap hand held movies. Having said that, this one wasn't too bad as much of the film didn't have that stupid herky-jerky motion, i.e. it was professionally shot and in wide screen. If you watch this film and haven't seen Quarantine, don't bother, or vice-versa.",REC
4,kosmasp,Shivering,9,10 August 2008,"Well this is another addition to the ""shakey""-camera style movie, that could be confused with a documentary. Of course since ""Blair Witch Project"" no one will (should) fall under the impression this is actually a documentary. Actually no one should have believed that in the first place (about B.W.P. that is), but that is a completely different matter.This movie was of a particular interest for me, because of (one of) the director(s). I have seen his movies ""Darkness"" and ""Nameless"". The latter being superior in the fright department. But all those movies having one thing in common (even if shot differently): They do begin in a very low key fashion, more likely to even be a drama or character piece, but then turning on you, when you already know the characters so good, that you care for them. Well this movie does deliver on that, although it might take too long for a few people, until it actually ""starts"" (into the horror/suspense), but when it does, it more than delivers!",REC
5,Tweekums,Spanish horror that provides plenty of scares,9,4 August 2019,"This film follows reporter Ángela Vidal who, along with cameraman Pablo, is making a series called 'While You're Sleeping'. In the latest instalment they are spending the night at a Barcelona fire station. It looks like they are going to have a quiet night till the firemen they are to accompany are called to an apartment building to help an old woman trapped in her flat. Once they gain entry the woman attacks and bites a police officer; they try to take him out to an ambulance but the building has been sealed. The authorities are saying that nobody may leave and that force will be used against anybody who tries. People soon start to panic and it becomes clear that they are in real danger as those who have been bitten start attacking the others. As the action plays out Ángela is determined to keep the camera rolling to document what is happening.The way this will is shot; with everything we see and hear being recorded on Pablo's camera might make one think that this is just a 'Spanish Blair Witch set in a building'... while there are elements of that there are also crucial differences. When bad things happen they are on camera and are both scary and bloody; we also have a larger cast of potential victims and the sealed building adds to the sense of claustrophobia. Once the unpleasantness gets started the sense of danger rarely lets up. I liked Manuela Velasco's performance as Ángela; early on capturing her excitement at being part of a big story then the terror as she realises the danger she is in. The rest of the cast are solid too. The handheld camera work, complete with a lot of shaking, may be too much for some people but I found it effective. Overall I'd recommend this to horror fans; especially if you enjoy the found footage genre.These comments are based on watching the film in Spanish with English subtitles.",REC
6,ma-cortes,Sinister and horrifying atmosphere by means of shaky camera and videotape,6,9 March 2009,"This eerie teal deals with a TV journalist named Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman occupying to spend themselves the night shift with Barcelona fire station . After a routine call take them to an apartments building . There they find residents , cops , caretaker already in the scenario . They soon learn that a woman living in the building has been infected by something unknown . Later on , a few neighbours are brutally attacked by psycho people . They attempt the getaway but only encounter that have been quarantined . The communication means have been cut-off and police agents are not relaying information to those closed inside .This solid movie is a terror story plenty of suspense , restless horror , and in documentary style . Film itself takes place from point of sight from cameraman . It packs tension , shocks , thrills , chills and lots of gore and blood . Well worth seeing if you like shaky cameras , like ¨Blair witch project¨, ¨28 Days/Weeks¨ ,¨Cloverfield¨ or the classic ¨Cannibal Holocaust¨ . The picture was well directed by Jaume Balaguero (Fragiles , Darkness , Nameless) and Paco Plaza(Romasanta, Second name), two magnificent terror experts . Both of them are directing the second part with similar outfit , actors (Manuela Velasco) and director of photography (Pablo Rosso) . It's remade by an inferior adaptation , titled ¨Quarantine¨ directed by John Erick with Jennifer Carpenter, Jay Hernandez and Steve Harris , but this original is far superior . It's one of the highest earning horror movies of the last years.",REC
7,BA_Harrison,Spain's attempt at the zombie-documentary!,6,11 May 2008,"After the disappointing 'Diary of the Dead' and the abysmal 'The Zombie Diaries', I was hoping that the much trumpeted REC would finally do the pseudo-documentary zombie outbreak premise justice. But whilst it is definitely an improvement on the aforementioned films, it still fails to be a wholly satisfying experience.Directed by Spanish duo Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, REC sees a pretty television reporter Ángela (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman fighting for their lives (whilst recording every moment, of course) after becoming trapped in a zombie infested apartment block.Utilising POV shots for its entirety, the film does succeed in being a fairly frightening affair, with the convincing cinema verité style effectively conveying the growing sense of panic (a great night-vision sequence being the tensest moment in the film). What ultimately stops REC from being a complete success, however, is an over-reliance on clichéd mechanical scares (accompanied by loud sound effectsnatch!), an explanation for the zombie outbreak that makes little sense, and a finalé that leaves you feeling that the makers could not think of a decent way to end the film.I also don't like the fact that I can't type the film's full title in my comment because IMDb sees the brackets as HTML mark-up!!",REC
8,paul_haakonsen,Stalkingly creepy,7,24 February 2010,"Wow! This movie is the sort of movie that picks you up by the neck and drops you right in the middle of the excitement - literally. The way the movie is shot with the camera is amazing. It is like you are there yourself, being a part of that horrible experience of being boxed inside a relatively small area and being stalked by crazed infected people.The infected were great, good make-up and effects, and brought a lot of excitement to the movie.The scenery and sets brought life to the movie. It was so dark and brooding, that it totally made the screen come alive with sense of dread and enclosing doom. It all came together for a good sense of claustrophobia and hopelessness.""Rec"" had a good cast of actors. Everyone portrayed their roles well and made the characters stand out as believable and real people.This is one of the better horror/thriller movies in a while, and it have a fresh sense of dread to it, which helps spices up the genre. The bad thing about ""Rec"" is that Hollywood decided to tap into the success of the Spanish movie and Americanize it. Usually Hollywood remakes of non-American movies is crap and an insult to the original versions. But seeing past Hollywood's greed, ""Rec"" is a really good movie that anyone with a taste for horror (and zombie movies, despite these here not being typical zombies) should watch.This movie will keep you at the edge of the seats.",REC
9,Quinoa1984,"balls-to-the-wall, first-person horror-show, one of the finest and most daring in recent memory",10,24 April 2008,"Part of the problem with a flesh-eating scare flick is that, in the weird way it is with movies, you know it's got to have zombies. Then it's got to have a reason for why they're zombies, what is it that could've thrust such things into the woodwork. There is that to REC. I mention this because, for those who would care simply for the story, might feel let-down... And yet, stewing over it some more, why carp when done just about right? This is about as true to form as they come, and then some. For this kind of quasi sub-genre that's formed for the cinema verite the-cameraman-is-part-of-the-action flick, it's a masterpiece, maybe the best of the bunch that's come out since The Blair Witch Project (or, arguably, before that with Man Bites Dog, albeit not technically horror). It posits that we're right here with these characters, and it keeps this unbelievable, excruciating tension and shock that it's too visceral for comparison. The level of angst with this little cataclysm of horror is comparable on that level to the likes of United 93. It's pure.From the opening scenes, as we follow a news crew with a group of firefighters (featuring a woman, Manuela Velasco, who is so fantastic it's hard not to believe she isn't a real news reporter acting for the first time), it doesn't seem like anything horrific. Then they go out to a call; someone's called about something peculiar in an apartment. An old woman goes on the attack. Then the quarantine of the apartment- everyone from the firefighters to the residents are trapped. The s*** hits the proverbial fan from there.Aside from being well-shot as far as one of these subjective POV movies go, the directors also have a lot of fun in tooling with expectations of style. Take a scene where the reporter and the cameraman look through a split-down-the-middle viewpoint of two of the infected (before 'becoming' officially) on gurneys being dissected, and then the subsequent attack. While the approach can be in your face to the max, there's impeccable craft put into the act of voyeurism, of not getting to see everything in the physical sense but being thrust through the wringer by the camera is enough to do the job. And, to help matters, the substance of the characters and the performances are all top-notch; we're never feeling pit against them or made to think they're stupid and out of context with the story. Practically all marks are hit for their targets, which is to knock one's socks off in the tradition of masters of terror. At the same time they inject a new intensity into the form that not Romero, or the Blair Witch guys, quite achieved as well.And, as an odd addendum of comparison, the most recent docu-stylized 'keep-on-shooting' zombie flick of late, Diary of the Dead, precipitated the way many in America will have to do in seeking the film out; available on a certain titan of a website I won't mention here, it's made as much for seeing on a computer screen, shot and uploaded as though for a you-tube experience, as much as for a regular theater. This isn't to say it's more than perfect with a whole audience at midnight, but if you can find it somehow online before it happens to make a theater appearance or (knock-on-wood before Quarantine) on DVD, it's more than worth the guilt of watching a movie for free online.",REC
10,Coventry,Reporting to you LIVE from a rabies-infested apartment complex!,6,31 March 2008,"Ah, the so-called ""Mocumentary"" People, preferably non-professionals, with hand-held cameras registering the unusual and horrific situations they find themselves stuck in; supposedly just with the intention to upload everything on YouTube and earn the respect of fellow internet-addicts. The concept exists since quite a while (remember the hugely irritating Blair Witch Project?) but the success only skyrocketed recently, with massively promoted films like ""Cloverfield"" and George A. Romero's ""Diary of the Dead"". This seemingly unstoppable new hype in nowadays cinema evokes some contradictory sentiments. I'm not the biggest fan of shaking cameras and regret noticing these films hardly ever have a plot, but on the other hand the innovative ""first-person-perspective"" undeniably contributed a lot to another huge popularity boost of the horror genre during the past year. The next prominent horror director to cash in on the trend is Jaume Balagueró. He (""The Nameless"", ""Darkness"") and his mate Paco Plaza (""The Second Name"") deliver what is so far the absolute best accomplishment in this still tenderly young sub genre. But the succeeding of ""Rec"" owes little to the hectic camera-work but pretty much everything to its nightmarish premise, the isolated interior filming location and the relentlessly brutal shock footage. More than anything, the film is a cheap excuse to depict gory set-pieces and hysterically screaming women, but by showing everything through one of the protagonists' camera lens, everything simply appears to be more realistic and involving. An overly ambitious female journalist from a regional TV-station and her cameraman stay for the night shift in a firehouse, hoping to register some real emergencies on film. Angela gets far more than she bargained for when they go along on an intervention in an old apartment building. One of the elderly tenants clearly has rabies, but before the firemen, the film crew and the rest of the inhabitants properly realize the seriousness of the situation, the building gets hermetically sealed off by the government. Trapped inside, the survivors reluctantly has to confront an increasing number of infected people and  most of all  keep filming everything in great detail. The events inside the building are suspenseful, raw and shocking (though honestly NOT as suspenseful, raw and shocking as everyone claims they are), including for example the attack from a zombie child and a nasty fall from a great height. The fear for an outbreak of a plague of rabies is admittedly far more realistic and unnerving as, say, an alien invasion (like in ""Cloverfield"") but still I can't join all the devoted fans who claim this is the ultimate type of horror. Personally, I never once felt like I was trapped in the building and/or threatened to become infected with rabies and turn into a zombie. Putting the emphasis on realism and identifiable characters still doesn't justify the severe lack of logic and explanation in the script. ""REC"" is an occasionally ingenious and adrenalin-rushing Spanish horror film, but please let's not falsely pretend it's an entirely new and groundbreaking masterpiece.",REC
11,Theo Robertson,Uneven But Still Effective For What It Is,7,25 February 2013,"Spanish cinema has a long history of cinematic horror . So does Britain it it probably wasn't coincidental that 28 WEEKS LATER the sequel to the Danny Boyle( Himself the quintessential British director ) hit 28 DAYS LATER was co-written by a Spanaird and directed by a Spanaird . In short if you're making a low budget horror movie with no sets and a small handful of actors ad-libbing then probably the only two countries that could produce something that would go on to become a surprise international horror hit would be either Britain or Spain . REC from 2007 became that surprise hit It should be pointed out of course that someone was a little bit naughty with the marketing . The trailers and TV spots in Britain failed to disclose that this was a Spanish film and indeed there was an English dubbed version which leads one to conclude that horror fans aren't given enough credit . Surely fear is an international language ? Are we to honestly believe that a lot of people wouldn't want to watch a horror film down to the fact that the characters can only communicate via subtitles ? Certainly I wouldn't recommend the dubbed version but if there's anything wrong with subtitles in this film it's to do with the startle moments where you're too busy reading the words on screen to catch the in your face shock bits that'll cause you to jump out of your seat . That said if you're listening to the actors in their original language the ad-libbed dialogue is infinitely more convincing As it stands REC is a slightly uneven film with a criticism that it's badly paced and derivative . This is true to a large extent and it's very difficult to comment on this movie without being reminded of 28 DAYS LATER , SPECIAL BULLETIN and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT . Likwise the last five minutes where journalist Angela and TV cameraman Pablo find themselves trapped in a dark apartment and the camera turns to night vision feels directly copied wholesale from the London Underground scenes from 28 WEEKS LATER but this sequence contains some of the most grotesque and effective imagery I've seen in a horror film for a very long time and its this last five minutes that earns REC a reputation as a classic European horror movie",REC
12,Scarecrow-88,Rec,9,8 October 2009,"Every once in a while you come across a film that lives up to the monumental hype and Rec is such an example. It is a zombie film shot in the Blair Witch Project tradition and excels in this format, actually feeling authentic instead of gimmicky. The plot is simple. A journalist and her camera operator are on an assignment following two firemen as they answer what seems to be a routine call regarding a scream heard in an apartment complex. Soon it's realized that an old woman upstairs has an affliction which causes the infected to act in a rabid manner, charging towards others liken to a crazed mutt with rabies. Following the zombie mythology, if an infected human bites a victim, he or she will become rabid as well. Once bitten, the victim dies and becomes a zombie just like the typical Romero zombie, except these are more in the vein of the Danny Boyle creations in ""28 Days Later"" than ""Night of the Living Dead"". What makes Rec scary as hell is the story and how helpless those trapped within the apartment become when the plague starts spreading and those once healthy are bitten. Characters start running up and down stairs, into rooms, anywhere to find shelter from the predators. As is common in Romero and Boyle's zombies, it takes a little while(..not too long)for those bitten(..or who have transfered the blood of the infected through saliva)to turn. For nearly an hour, the plague(infection)is pretty well contained and the situation(..as dire as it looks)seems somewhat stable, as two bitten(..a policeman and a fireman)by the old woman are being looked after by an intern who lives in the apartment, and a policeman, along with a fireman, take control as best as they can. Soon a health inspector is allowed inside while the apartment is quarantined, not allowing anyone out until the area is deemed secure of possible contagion.Rec is quite an intense experience with a definite sense of urgency as the events transpire in a horrifying manner. Unlike many other films, Rec actually feels less cinematic and it was a great idea to have a news reporter and a camera operator be our guides through the terror as it unfolds. You can understand the mentality of young journalist, Ángela Vidal(Manuela Velasco)seeking the possibility of fame and prestige if she makes it out alive, which provides a valid reason for her ""recording everything you can"". This is the kind of scenario which could win a young reporter accolades. She records interviews of the tenants inside and we get an idea of the various personalities, their racism and hostility regarding each other(..an Asian couple, for instance, or the sick daughter of an unflappable mother who often says exactly what's on her mind). We witness the difficulty of the ones in charge trying to keep things civil, tough when you take into count that those trapped inside are worried about being stuck in the apartment for good. That's what resonated with me, the idea of having no escape as the plague yields more and more infected until the places of refuge evaporate, and chaos reigns. That's what makes the shot-on-video format so effective, if done correctly, the idea of capturing this devastating set of circumstances as it happens. Such sequences as the infected girl who separates from the group needing to be recovered, lights going out, zombies moving quickly upstairs as you attempt to unlock a room using a ring containing multiple keys, and the inspired ""there's something in the attic"" finale that adds the right amount of punch that makes Rec must-see viewing for every fan of the genre featuring the undead.This is a movie that grows in magnitude until the last image which was marketed heavily in the trailers of the rip-off, Quarantine, the film that kept American audiences from seeing Rec sooner. I will say that you must prepare for the camera shakes and falls at times due to certain instances where the operator is either running or dealing with those who wish not to be recorded. In my opinion, Rec deserves it's praise as one of the best horror films of this decade.",REC
13,Hey_Sweden,Intense and frightening.,8,22 October 2013,"The Spanish horror film ""Rec"" is among the best in the overdone ""found footage"" sub genre, as it delivers what could easily be described as a thrill ride. It starts off mildly enough, but it sure doesn't ease people into the horror, but drops them into it. Things take off from there, and only get more scary. The pacing is superb (this doesn't go on any longer than it has to at a mere 79 minute run time) and the action furious. Those movie watchers with no fondness for what is trendily dubbed ""shaky cam"" may find this aspect of the film off putting, but the action is never rendered too confusing. The finale is the best part, when things have quieted down and the suspense begins.Beautiful and appealing Manuela Velasco stars as Angela, a reporter for an after-hours TV series titled ""While You're Asleep"". She and cameraman Pablo (played by the films' cinematographer, Pablo Rosso) spend the night in a fire station, meeting the firefighters, hoping that there will be some excitement. But, as the saying goes, they should have been careful what they wished for. They become caught up in a nightmare when an infection breaks out in an apartment building, and the authorities outside take steps to make sure that no one can escape.This is certainly one example of how to properly do this sort of thing. One important aspect is that the characters never become unlikable or annoying to the point where we get tired of following them. The film has a great sense of immediacy; we feel like flies on the wall while we're watching and can share in the anxieties and fears of the people on screen. The film is effectively gory without ever going overboard in that department. And from the moment that the action begins, the sensation of events spiralling out of control is vividly captured on screen. All in all, this is fun stuff and it's well worth a viewing.Followed by three sequels, and the American remake ""Quarantine"" (itself followed by a sequel).Eight out of 10.",REC
14,preppy-3,Horrifying Spanish horror film,8,7 October 2021,"A beautiful female TV reporter and her cameraman follow a group of firemen on a call. They go to an apartment building where loud screams are heard from an elderly woman's unit. The fireman break into her apartment. She's bleeding and screaming nonstop and attacks them. It seems she's infected and the other residents might be too. Authorities seal off the building allowing no one out and they all have to deal with each other...and the infection.VERY bloody and gory with good acting. Even better it moves quickly (it's only 78 minutes) and never stops. Very scary and unsettling. It was remade in the US as ""Quarantine"" in 2008. That's good too but this is better!",REC
15,dbborroughs,Scary film about a the spread of an infection is vastly superior to the (at times shot for shot) Hollywood remake,7,20 October 2008,"A news crew is spending the night at a firehouse as part of a series called ""while you sleep"" which shows what happens i places at night. The crew tries to fill the void of a quiet night before a call comes in and the rescue squad goes off to help an elderly woman in an apartment building. Once there they find the woman is up and about though dazed. Suddenly out of nowhere she attacks the rescuers. When the police and firemen in the building cal for help, its fast to arrive, and fast to seal them in the building since there appears to be some form of infection spreading inside.Tight little POV film, its all the footage from the news crew's camera, is a creepy ride into the dark side as things go from bad to worse as people die and others become infected and no one is allowed to leave. One of the better POV films to have come out recently (Think Cloverfield or Diary of the Dead), this is an unnerving little film that quietly builds up characters and tension and makes you wonder whats going to happen next.The film looks like its raw news footage at times, one needs only compare it to the footage that came from the filmmakers who went to the World Trade Center on 9/11 to see how much they got right. Watching the film on DVD (which I think helped because of the nature of the film) I found myself twisting in my seat wondering what in the hell was going to happen next.I also found myself going back to see what had just happened because somethings happen so fast I missed them. Its such a neat little thriller that its completely understandable that Hollywood would want to remake it (as Quarantine). As with the recent spate of Asian horror remakes the original is light years above the remake.",REC
16,Bunuel1976,"[.REC] (Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza, 2007) ***",7,11 June 2010,"I knew this had garnered a reputation of some kind among the recent spate of Euro-Horrors but, knowing it was yet another zombie flick and that it was filmed in BLAIR WITCH PROJECT-style, I cannot say I was particularly enthusiastic; as a matter of fact, I had the DVD rental for about two months before I finally got around to it! Well, I have to say that I was very much impressed with the film (so much so that I ended up adding it to my collection) – which, at 78 minutes, does not overstay its welcome. That said, being more or less aware of the plot – a TV crew follows a firefighting unit around on its nightly rounds, with everybody finding themselves in over their heads amid what appears to be a zombie plague in a condominium (which is subsequently sealed off) – I was somewhat restless throughout the opening quarter of an hour or so of exposition. However, once things get going, there is just no let-up: even so, along with all the carnage, action and necessarily shaky camera-work, a good deal of care is still invested in the characterization (particularly the unscrupulous young heroine played by an award-winning Manuela Velasco)and, of course, the confined setting takes the level of claustrophobia (intrinsic to such fare) up by several notches! As zombie movies go, this is certainly among the best of recent vintage (comparable, and perhaps even superior, to 28 DAYS LATER [2002]), featuring plentiful gore and following the current trend of nimble rather than shuffling creatures; however, there is a twist towards the end that comes completely out of left field – taking this into a different subgenre altogether! – but which, once accepted, reaps immense rewards. One thing which is worth noting here is the sheer amount of swear words directed at the Holy Communion: this form of blasphemy is apparently prevalent in fervently Catholic countries such as Spain, Italy and Malta! The film was successful enough to warrant a much inferior American remake (QUARANTINE [2008]: see review) and even started off a franchise, incorporating the equally good [.REC]2 (2009; also reviewed below) and the still-in-production [.REC] GENESIS and [.REC] APOCALYPSE.",REC

Pablo (Pablo Rosso), the cameraman, is critical to the film. His partner, Angela (Manuela Velasco), makes watching it worthwhile as she has an energy that keeps thing moving. It's hard to accept her Best New Actress awards when she started in Pedro Almodovar's Law of Desire twenty years ago, when she was 12.One can almost imagine a news report as the trapped inhabitants of an apartment building realize there is no way out and people are dying.There are other good characters in the film, Guillem (Carlos Vicente), the intern; and César (Carlos Lasarte) as a vain gay man.78 minutes does give a lot of time for character development, so the film is mostly action. It really ramps up when they find out what is going on to create - yes - ZOMBIES! Jennifer (Claudia Font), the little girl, was the creepiest.But, the monster in the closet was terrifying!

18,grantss,Original and convincing,7,20 April 2020,"Very original horror-thriller. Told through the lens of TV news cameraman and his reporter. Similar to Cloverfield (and, to a lesser extent, the Blair Witch Project) in its feel. Very convincing.",REC
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Cut,7,11 December 2009,"I watched Quarantine before this, and in the cinema(as opposed to at home, on DVD, as with this) before this. Perhaps that colored my opinion somewhat. I do maintain, however, that I would never have completely loved this. The two are rather similar. One could go as far as saying that once you've seen one, you've basically seen the other, as well. The reporter is about as perky(I'm talking about her face, you perv) and irritating as in the remake. Many scenes are the same to an extent. Anyway, I'll move on to the specifics of this film. The commentary is good, and relatively subtly delivered. Acting varies, and a lot of it is only OK. The dialog feels realistic(some would call it ""dull""), and this definitely is psychologically accurate at points, maybe even most of the time. It's pretty engaging, and the plot is interesting enough. Atmosphere and mood are reasonable, though it would be nice if they went for something more elaborate than jump-scares. One thing that detracts from the whole is that, for making the stylistic choice of using the form of a faux documentary, they didn't deem it necessary to stick to the limitations that come with that. The question of why - if accepting that what we are seeing is supposed to have happened in the movie's universe - this was edited the way it was is one of the minor things. It's worse that there are, in a few sequences, sounds that could not possibly come from anything in the vicinity(or would not be picked up as well or poorly). And it is downright heinous when a character asks the camera operator to rewind something... and then we *see* the footage being rewound! In the history of idiotic logical fallacies, that is one of the worst I've seen. You can't record and play at the same time! There's only the one tape! Who doesn't get that? It comes off as the fourth wall being broken, and it pulls us right out of the fictitious world that we are presented with. The pacing is fine, the 70 minutes of this before the credits roll pass smoothly enough. All in all, I gotta say, for a second viewing, I'd go for the American version over this. There is frequent brutal bloody violence, strong language and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to fans of horror. 7/10",REC
20,view_and_review,REC Scores for the Found Footage Genre,7,3 January 2016,"Not all found footage films are created equal. Heck, that goes for traditional movies as well so that's not news. But, this film is a cut above the rest. If I were to classify found footage films I would put them in three groups. 1.) The ""Paranormal Activity"" style. 2.) The film crew style.3.) The amateur videographer styleThe ""Paranormal Activity"" style is strategic placement of cameras throughout the location to catch the various action. It makes sense and doesn't rely on a single cameraman to be present everywhere. The film crew (even if it's just one cameraman) works because their job is to video document, which means they'll be skilled at it and continue doing just that even when things get weird. They usually have higher end cameras and camera equipment for a better viewing experience. ""REC"" follows this format. And unlike some movies where it becomes irrational to continue filming, in this movie it was a logical conclusion to keep filming as they wanted to prove to the world what was happening. The amateur videographer style usually doesn't work that well. First, he's an amateur. And Second, many times he's with a camera filming everything even when it doesn't make sense for him to be doing that (which really grates my nerves).As for ""REC"", it's done really well. The acting was spectacular. There was a real natural feel to it as Angela (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman Pablo (Pablo Rosso) were documenting the events of the night. Nothing seemed rehearsed; their interviews, their regular conversation, and even the reactions to the complete chaos that ensued. The shots were great and the movie was edited to near perfection. ""REC"" hits a home run for the found footage genre.",REC
21,Uriah43,Raw and Bloody,7,15 March 2013,"""Angela Vidal"" (Manuela Velasco) is a young television reporter who is collecting material for a night-time show called, ""While You're Sleeping"" in Barcelona. In this particular episode she and her cameraman, ""Pablo"" (Pablo Rosso) are sent to a fire station to film an ordinary night with the fire department. When a call is received they decide to follow two firemen, ""Manu"" (Ferran Terraza) and ""Alex"" (David Vert) who are assigned to the case. Upon arriving at an apartment complex they notice that two policemen have also just made it to the scene and so they follow them inside. Once inside they all go upstairs to find an old woman covered in blood and screaming. She then bites one of the policemen in the throat and after pulling her off they evacuate downstairs taking the injured policeman with them. Not long afterward Alex goes up to check out the situation and he is also attacked and thrown down the staircase suffering serious injuries as well. At this point the decision is made to evacuate the apartment complex but they find that the ""Public Health Department"" has locked them inside and blockaded the exits. They are trapped inside with the residents. At any rate, rather than divulging what happens next I will just say that this is a very exciting film which tends to be rather raw and bloody. But if you like zombie movies then this is one that you will definitely want to see and add to your collection.",REC
22,morrison-dylan-fan,Rec:part 1,10,10 October 2012,"With the exception of the mostly enjoyable The Last Exorcisum , (sadly ruined by a terrible ending) I have somehow completely missed taking the slightest look at a revived Horror sub-genre called ""Found Footage"".Deciding to at last take a look at some Horror ""mock-docs"",I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the makers of a series of Spanish Horror mock-doc movies called Rec,had recently announced plans to make a fourth and final film.Being greatly intrigued by the sound of the films extremely claustrophobic setting,I decided to start right at the beginning and take a look at Rec's first ever recording.The plot:Arriving at the local fire station with her cameraman Pablo to record an upcoming episode of her late night TV series ""While You're Asleep"",TV presenter Angela Vidal gets prepared to spend the night catching footage of Firemen and women putting their very lives at risk to protect the public.Sadly for Vidal,she begins to suspect that her fantasy is far away from the real life work that the firefighters do. Angela watches time pass slowly by,as she and Pablo start to do interviews with all of the fire crew,in the hope of gathering enough footage to create a ""filler"" episode.Getting close to giving up on anything taking place,Vidal and Pablo hear the fire alarm start to ring.As the alarm and phone rings, all of the firefighters rush out to respond to the call,which has told them that an old woman,who lives near the very top of a block of flats, has been screaming for help,due to having gotten stuck inside her apartment.Having come along to film,what the firefighters say will be a ""typical situation"",Pablo and Vidal make sure to keep up with the crew as they climb up the stairs to reach the old woman's apartment.Breaking down the apartments door,the crew are left in a state of shock,when instead of thanking them,the deranged looking woman instead runs towards one of the crew members and starts to viscously rip his face off.Recording every moment of the incident,Vidal and Pablo start think that this ""typical incident"" is in fact going to be far stranger (and deadlier) then any of them would have wanted to imagine.View on the film:Leaving behind the outside world within the first 10 minutes of the film,writers (along with Luiso Berdejo) /directors Jaume Balguero and Paco Plaza tremendously never make the movie feel like its restricting its self,by creating one of the most atmospheric and chillingly claustrophobic settings that I have seen in any film for a good number of years.Using ""one camera"" for the entire movie,Balguero and Plaza make the audience feel that there is absolutely no way out for either themselves or the characters,by showing the entire block of flats to be small and dimly lit,with the constant risk of something pretty nasty breathing down the viewers neck,to trapping them in one of the many dark corners of the building.Keeping the story moving at a fast, frightening pace,the writer's cleverly make sure that the movie never becomes a screaming fest,by placing,well timed ""breather"" moments that allows a detailed sketch of the characters such as Angela Vidal, (played with an excellent mix of confidence and nervousness by the stunning Manuela Velasco) to be built as they get closer to discovering what has been unleashed at the centre of the building,which help to give the claustrophobic,abrasives Horror moments a much stronger impact,that leads to this being a recording that will hopefully continued being tapped.",REC
23,FlashCallahan,My face is shiny......,7,22 November 2013,"We follow a Spanish late-night television reporter Ángela Vidal, through the lens of her cameraman, Pablo. During one report, the duo follow a team of firefighters who get a call from an apartment building nearby about a trapped woman. When they arrive, they find the apartment's residents huddled in the lobby. They go upstairs to find a woman who is obviously distressed. What follows is a night that none of them will ever forget......First off, if you've seen the remake of this before the original, then don't bother watching this, far superior movie, you really have no right, because this film deserves a lot more respect than its inferior Amercan cousin.The film is short, and as soon as we enter the apartment, it never lets up until the very end. The cast are great, and there are some truly shocking moments, like the firefighter who just falls from out of nowhere.Referencing 28 days later, and many found footage movies, the film isn't original, the ending reeks of Blair Witch, but its straight to the point, and literally no one is safe in this apartment.The second movie is really good too.",REC
24,The_Void,Pure terror on screen - THIS is how to make a first person horror movie!,9,30 March 2008,"It appears that point-of-view films are the latest trend in horror with a handful of these films being released lately. The obvious film to credit this trend to would be the lamentable blair witch project; but personally I'd attribute it more to the popularity of 'user generated' content on websites such as Youtube. The great George A. Romero already used this idea for a zombie movie with his latest gore fest 'Diary of the Dead', and while that movie was a good example of how it could be used; the first movie to really do it properly is this one. Rec takes the foundations laid out by the likes of blair witch project and does it properly; using the first person perspective to put the audience at the very centre of the action and building up a very frightening situation around it, and the result is one of the first truly unsettling movies in years! The plot is very simple. At the start, we are introduced to Angela; the presenter of 'While You Are Sleeping', a late night TV show. She and her cameraman have been dispatched to spend the night with the fire brigade and look into what they do. They are soon sent on a routine callout, answering a plea from an apartment block in town. However, it's not long before they realise that what they've been sent into is anything but routine This movie definitely lacks substance and features more than a few plot holes, but when the movie kicks off properly; I would be very surprised if anyone gives the negative elements a second thought. The film gets off to a fairly slow start; the lead character and the situation is introduced, and directors Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza slowly build up the tension and suspense. Admittedly, the first two thirds of the movie are not overly brilliant; the film is never boring but it's not until the final third that things really kick off, and when they do is when Rec begins firing on all cylinders - transforming into an exhilarating, adrenaline-fuelled expose of pure horror - I honestly was hoping it would hurry up and end just so I could relax! It's by then that the first person perspective really pays off; whether you care for the central characters or not is completely unimportant as the directors succeed in making it feel like YOU are in this situation. The 'shaky cam' comes under a lot of criticism, and rightly so because most (or maybe all) of the movie it has featured in have been big letdowns but that is not the case here - THIS is how to make a first person 'shaky cam' horror movie! There are things left unanswered by the end, but the final twist is better (and more original) than any explanation I was hoping for and no amount of plot holes can take anything away from this experience. Rec is one of the best modern horror films in years and if you consider yourself a horror fan, you won't want to miss it!",REC
25,trashgang,not for the squeamish,8,28 September 2010,"It took me 3 years to finally plug it into the DVD player, shame on me. By now everybody knows what it is all about. REC 2 is already out and an American remake is also out called Quarantine. This flick fits into the docu genre like Blair Witch. And I can state that it is as frightening as Blair Witch. This flick came without warning into the horror genre. It came one year before Cloverfield, another docu film but that one failed for me. REC is simply about a film crew following a fire brigade in Barcelona. So far so good until they arrive in a house or where a woman has screamed everybody awake. So far no problem until the fire brigade confronts the woman. Suddenly she attacks a police officer and things gets rolling. I must say that I jumped a few times out of the settee. The 5.1 surely gives the creeps when they are walking in the building and again, the use of a possessed girl still gives me goose bumps. The difference with Blair Witch is that BW never showed anything. It was all about sounds and creepiness. Here we really see what is happening. In the beginning of the movie when you don't think anything will happen suddenly it happens, the fireman falling down. It really works. The only thing that has a mistake is the tape recorder. It's a bit weak that every time she rewinds it it stops exactly into the beginning of a sentence. But overall, it surely isn't for the squeamish, a nice surprise from Spain.",REC
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: REC,8,3 November 2008,"REC has been making its rounds in the festival and cinema circuit, while us folks here have to sit around and twiddle our thumbs, wondering if it'll ever make it to our shores. Hollywood reckoned it was worthy of a remake, and they did Quarantine, which was surprisingly made quite fast, and was penned to be released here as well. Guess someone got smart and decided to pre-empt that remake version with the original, and for some, the decision will be whether to double dip, stick to the original, or the remake when it's released at the end of the month.This is one effective, relatively low budget movie along the same veins of horror movies making good use of the shaky cam. Those who feel queasy will naturally want to give this a miss, but then again, you'll be giving up on some really scary stuff here designed to put those shaky constraints and limitations to the test. Of course there's a story to follow, and despite its short run time, there are enough material here to build up the back story, as well as presenting the lead characters as someone you'd really care about in wanting them to emerge from this strange ordeal unscathed.We follow a television crew in their filming of an episode of ""While You're Asleep"", where journalist Angela (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman Pablo (Pablo Rosso, of course it's natural to name this cameraman after your DOP) follow the adventures of firemen in their neighbourhood. In a strange pre-emptive irony, the chief commented that 70% of the time they deal with, instead of fires, rather mundane stuff like rescuing pets, or some other unexpected incidents. I guess nothing will prepare them for what's to come.So an SOS call is made, and for the entire movie, we follow the point of view of the cameraman, as our entourage arrive at a small building where you have an old woman lumbering around before starting to attack the policeman on duty. Before you know it, they're ordered by the authorities outside the building to listen to the duty cop, and to stay at all times at the lobby hallway. The building gets physically quarantined, and soon everyone starts getting jittery with the lack of information.Saying too much will be letting the cat out of the bag, but suffice to say that every capability of a camera was put to good use here, and there were moments which draw the audience into rapturous cheers and even drew some unintended laughter, but for the most parts, it's really an effective mix of silence and noise, and plenty of confidence in knowing what to show verbatim, and when to pull back to obscure. After all, the best horror device here to put into use, are everyone's imagination just how bad things have deteriorated and become, planting catalysts into the minds via sneaky peeps.It's quite excellent on many fronts, such as how low frills this can actually be, but yet present itself in engaging and entertaining ways. For those looking for a good scare, look no further than REC. And yes, I'll be double dipping and watching Quarantine, just to see if Hollywood can bastardize something incredible, and dumb it down unnecessarily through the need to explain everything.",REC

Starts modestly enough, almost banal, as we follow a local TV crew as they spend time with the local emergency fire service. Point of view all the time so whilst we might not get particularly involved with the participants, it is us in the line of fire, as it were, as the film progresses. First call is to someone apparently trapped in a building so not the flames and excitement anticipated by the film crew and ourselves. However, things happen. basically we are talking zombies but this is a very original take. The film is not over long so we get a tight, taught and terrifying hour and a quarter. Its not the best horror film ever but no fan should be disappointed. Imaginative.",REC
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,Oneof the scariest movies I have ever seen,9,12 November 2008,"OK, I admit it, I'm shallow, I didn't know about this film's existence until I saw Quarantine and went onto IMDb.com and saw all these complaints on how Rec was so much better. So I went onto youtube and found Rec just to see what it was like and the strange thing is, I saw Quarantine in the movie theater, I wasn't scared, I watched Rec on my computer and it scared me to death. I think the story was a little better explained in this version as well as it was just more intense. I feel weird saying that because Quarantine is the exact same movie just it's done in English, but for some weird reason this movie just scared me even more. I think I also liked the actors a little better in this movie because they seemed stronger and reacted more naturally. Rec is one of the scariest movies I have seen in a long time and I really wish I checked it out earlier than I did.Angela is a TV reporter who does a quick little night segment on firefighters and what their jobs are like. Everything starts pretty boring and it seems like they're not going to get a great story... until there is a disturbance call. They all go to this apartment building where everyone is downstairs complaining about noises coming from this apartment with an older woman, the fireman and police go up there to find the woman very disturbed and mumbling. All of a sudden the woman tries to attack them, the police and firemen along with Angela go downstairs to find out that they've been locked in, the police outside have quarantined the building. The woman viciously bites one of the firemen who turns into a rabid zombie who starts attacking the others. The virus is spreading and there's only so much time before they all descend into this scary nightmare.I would highly recommend Rec for any movie fan, this was just a fun movie to watch and one of the better horror films I've seen. Quarantine was just the American version with a few deleted scenes that are not in Rec, but I felt that Rec explained itself better. Why and how the virus came to be as well as where the mysterious tenant is and what he did. Like I said, I do feel silly, they're both pretty much the exact same movie just in different languages, but I just enjoyed this movie was just better. So if you do get the opportunity, I do highly recommend going on the net and looking up this movie, it'll give you the heebee geebee's... OK, that was lame.9/10",REC
30,KineticSeoul,First person view horror flick done right,7,9 July 2011,"This is a horror movies that is in first person view mode for the most part because a camera is filming everything that is going on. I am not going to give anything away since the less you know about this film the way better it is. The only flaws I can think of is how the acting seem a bit exaggerated since it sort of takes out the realism. And that is the main aspect about this movie that make it so good. Also the constant bickering and arguing amongst the people in this gets annoying after a while and didn't seem realistic and a bit forced, also when it was finished it felt like there should have been a bit more going on. But with the budget this movie had it did almost everything it can with it and the execution of everything that happens kept me interested from beginning to end. The main character Ángela Vidal who is a television reporter was just so very annoying and irritating to watch to the point I could careless what happened to her in this movie. Anyways despite some flaws this is a excellent low budget movie and is a first person view horror flick done right. I personally liked it more than ""Cloverfield"" and way more than ""The Blair Witch Project"".7.8/10",REC
31,sddavis63,What's Not To Love About This?,9,7 November 2010,"Having seen the American remake of this movie (""Quarantine"") a few years ago and found it one of the best horror movies of recent years, I looked forward to seeing the Spanish original and was certainly not disappointed. Obviously, a bit of the chill factor is missing if you've seen ""Quarantine"" because the stories are very, very similar (""Quarantine"" really was a very faithful remake) but perhaps that allows for more appreciation of the brilliant performances from a group of actors who are absolutely convincing as the terrified residents, emergency workers and a local news crew, trapped inside an apartment building in which a horrifying, apparently rabies-like virus is rapidly spreading. As people become infected, they turn extremely violent, biting at those around them, which spreads the disease further.It's a simple movie, shot through the lens of the news camera man Pablo who keeps his camera rolling in the midst of the horror around him, all the while accompanied by reporter Angela, who had been filming a TV documentary about the life of fire fighters, and ended up getting way more than she bargained for.There's little to criticize about this. It's frightening, the sense of hopelessness grows throughout, the acting is great. I'm not a fan of subtitles at the best of times because they can be distracting as you're trying to both watch the action and read the dialogue, and the subtitles in this were rather small and on occasion blended in with the background, making them very hard to read. Truthfully, though, most of the dialogue isn't particularly necessary, because it's the sense of fear that's important in this - and that comes through regardless of language.",REC
32,thesar-2,While You Were Sleeping...,8,5 July 2010,"It's my fault with this viewing of Rec that I can't remember if I originally saw the US remake, Quarantine only, or the original, Rec, before. I know I saw one (or both) of them a while back. And as I watched this incredibly short and tight movie, I became convinced that either I did see this Rec before, or I saw Quarantine, which would then be a shot-by-shot exact replica of the foreign film: Rec. (Side Note: I just now watched the trailer for Quarantine and it is, in fact, 100% lifted scenes from Rec.)Okay, I'm confused, or confusing, but either way, I will stick with what I'm (you're) here for: a review of Rec.As mentioned, it's short and tight, and thoroughly paced and entertaining, for this virus/zombie genre, that is. You have to be a fan of the 28 Days/Weeks Later and Cloverfield variety of films, i.e. flesh-eating virus/living dead or hand-held cameras, or at very least, have a strong stomach. You also must endure endless subtitles (if you don't understand Spanish) while the action/shaky camera is in constant motion.Pass all those tests, and you might enjoy this feature as I did.Late at night, a wannabe (more) video news reporter, Angela (Velasco) is assigned to the graveyard firemen shift to see ""what happens when you sleep."" After what appears to be a very long introduction, in such a quick movie, you'll find out, it's better not to know what happens when you doze.The firemen, and camera crew receive a call to a inner-city apartment complex stemming from a call of a woman screaming in her apartment. They break in, and get attacked – by the stereotypical vicious/rabid bite on the neck. Anyone's familiar with the above mentioned films, 28 Days/Weeks Later, knows what to expect. But, for those brand new, they'll show you the confusion, outbreak and laughable attempts at containment from those inside.What's new is the quick response (not found in nearly any Night of the Living Dead/virus films or those types) of the police/medical/disease crews outside that seal off the place weeks faster than FEMA could only dream of. This doesn't help those trapped inside with the quickly spreading germ that makes humans into Cujo fans.Little to no explanation is given to why this is happening, but Angela demands that the every scene is shot, no matter the battery can't possibly last in the camera used to document this tragedy. Skipping right over that flaw, chaos from the confused, frightened and cornered apartment complex dwellers doesn't end as they're picked off one by one.The finale gives some well needed background, but as in 97.8% of these movies, what's left unknown is the writer's desire to scare us more. Personally, (kind of a spoiler here) I would love for once, that they do not only explain it, but end on a happy note. Just once. Please. Okay, fine, they sorta did for Outbreak, and that's the weakest one. In my defense/desire, Outbreak was meant for more mainstream and a happier movie, whereas I'm referring to darker tales, like Rec, that end with some simmer of hope.Nevertheless, this is a great movie for what it is. Some of the scenes (and I won't ruin them) shocked me the second the happened as I didn't expect it. I liked the originality/turn of an already long-list of zombie/virus movies.What I didn't like was having to read the movie – and boy, they wouldn't shut up for a few seconds so we can enjoy the thrills and scares – when so much is happening. Additionally, in the closing, we're expected to read a lot of what's on a wall. They'll give you some translation, but not all. Sure, that's my bad for taking French in High School over Spanish – duh, I live in Arizona. I was a dumb kid.Rec wasn't groundbreaking, but is a definite must see even if you're only a drive-by fan of neck-biting, disease spreading horror.",REC
33,MOscarbradley,Trite horror movie with nothing original to say,4,2 November 2008,"Drivel, that takes the ""Blair Witch""/""Cloverfield"" rouge of only existing because everything that we see is being filmed, as if in real time, by an unseen cameraman operating a video-camera. It worked best in ""Cloverfield"" because it used a much wider canvas, (the whole of Manhatten), and was something of a technical achievement. Here the action all takes place in an apartment block where the inhabitants are running amok zombie-style after being infected by a mysterious rabies-like virus.This is David Cronenberg's ""Shivers"" with extra gore and a certain amount of technical skill in the execution. There is no denying it's very well done and the last ten minutes or so worked because then it reverts to the good, old-fashioned creepy notion that what we don't see but what we imagine might be there, is infinitely more terrifying than anything the special effects boys might conjure up. It's certainly not original, though, and the best I can say for it is that it is mercifully short at 75 minutes.",REC
34,Cineanalyst,"More Found Footage, More Zombies",6,11 May 2020,"The concept of this title stylized after the recording identifier on video cameras is to bring together two of the most popular--even tired--aspects of turn-of-the-century and recent horror flicks, the found-footage style and zombies. It's another in a long line of imitators of ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999), which popularized this pseudo-documentary approach, replacing a witch with demons (""Paranormal Activity"" series), aliens (""District 9"" (2009)), alien kaiju (""Cloverfield"" (2008)), teenagers with superpowers (""Chronicle"" (2012) and all other manners of terrifying creatures and horror tropes. So, here's one with zombies, which itself was popular enough to be extended by sequels, an English-language remake, and even George A. Romero went on to make a found-footage zombie entry of his own. As far as this particular combination of subgenres goes, it's relatively successful, if ultimately mostly uninteresting beyond its ability to frighten.As opposed to some other found-footage movies, this one puts the spectator in the present of the video being filmed instead of seeing the footage after the fact. This becomes apparent when the cameraman rewinds the footage, and we see a scene again. In this sense, we are the camera(man). This is in contrast to, for instance, the rewinding scene in ""Cloverfield,"" where we don't see the scene repeated. A couple other notes I made of this movie are that the storyline of treating zombies as a virus--the reason, by the way, that I viewed this, now, during the current pandemic--works well, including the severe quarantine. I'm less fond of the opening and ending narratively. The fire station stuff that these TV reporters were filming simply wasn't compelling. Granted, that makes it believable as the sort of late-night filler that would be aired on TV, but that's not something I want to watch. The concluding stuff concerning Catholicism and exorcisms, on the other hand, just seems unnecessary--rather like filler for a movie that is already relatively short in runtime.",REC

There's just something about 'Rec' that makes it stand out from the crowd. The film manages to completely suck you into the chaos that ensues. It is non-stop thrills and chills, and an interesting story. We perceive the 'victims' to be zombies, but this is never mentioned in the film and the characters simply refer to it as a ""sickness"", making it more realistic.The film features excellent make-up effects. My only criticism is that it is too shaky at times. Considering the crew of a TV show is making a documentary, their camera has very bad focus capabilities, without a stabilizer. The footage reminds one more of material from an ordinary hand-held camera instead of a professional camera operated by an industry professional. Apart from that, I can recommend this film if you're into the found footage genre.",REC

May have something to do with the fact that I regard Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND the greatest tale of terror ever told (and I'm not alone: George Romero was inspired to create the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD after reading it). Like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and all its offspring, REC gives us a band of wannabe survivors under siege. Using the hand-held approach made popular by THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, REC is told first-person as it were (subjectively, in film terms) and does so sometimes brilliantly: there are enough stepping-around-the-corner-right-into-the-thick-of-it shots to keep you on your toes (or the edge of your seat). I've gotta admit I found my heart in my mouth a couple of times (How'd that get there...?). The big payoff is worth waiting for, too.

Total unbelievable and ridiculous behavior and more important the whole one cam perspective just don't works well. Especially because you can do increase suspense etc. with a good cam work.

All the other movies I saw using that real-time-whatever-the-special-term-is-cam are not improved but weakened by that choice to use that perspective only.

43,funkyfry,"what an awful, terrible movie!",2,8 March 2010,"I just absolutely loathed this movie. First of all, it's one of those incredibly annoying movies where the whole thing is supposed to represent ""reality"" and the images are captured by a (digital, ugh) TV news cameraman who apparently values getting a good shot so much that he doesn't even drop the camera when threatened by a dozen zombies.Secondly, the look and style of the movie is unrelentingly cheap. I haven't seen a zombie movie that looked this bad and was just so repetitive, endless corridors with zombies popping out of the doors, since John Carpenter's ""Prince of Darkness."" There are some gross and half-convincing gore effects, but nothing that would have shaken the world 20 years ago either.Thirdly, the story is just incredibly predictable and dull. Of course everyone is trapped in this building for some arbitrary reason so that the zombies can eat them all. Of course as soon as you see a little girl, you know that she's the main zombie because there's no other reason for her to be in the movie. An 11 year old could see most of this movie's twists coming, as long as they had seen ""Dawn of the Dead"" and a couple Italian zombie movies from the 70s.The final nail in the coffin -- all the actors are uniformly horrible. I don't know what it is with American audiences because people also praised ""Let the Right One In"" and it had even more embarrassing acting that wouldn't make it in Wisconsin summer stock than this one. I guess that people just assume if they're reading subtitles it must be good acting. Sadly this is not a safe assumption.Very poor movie, very stupid and very manipulative, and even includes the clichéd ""secret room that explains everything."" Avoid at all costs.",REC
44,billcr12,Good horror flick,7,29 March 2012,Rec is a horror film from Spain and it's pretty good. Angela Vidal is a TV reporter filming a series of vignettes when she gets a call regarding a woman trapped in a basement. She breaks into the building with police and fire department personnel. The old lady bites a cop and she is shot and killed. Angela and an unseen camera man document all the chaos and bloodshed. The occupants are either all dead or dying from some unknown virus. On their walk through the building they uncover a Vatican connection regarding a girl who is demonically possessed. Infrared shots are used to show the dark corridors and rooms and they give an interesting perspective. Manuela Velasco is a good choice as Angela Vidal and she carries the film to it's finish.

45,strong-122-478885,"Be Kind, Rewind",4,30 June 2014,"If you, like me, are totally annoyed by shaky, hand-held camera horror movies of the ""found footage"" kind, then, believe me, Rec is certain to be a real test of your patience.Rec contains so much hysterical screaming that, you can be sure, when filming was all over these actors must've had seriously ruptured vocal chords, one and all.Not only that, but, the number of furious rages over petty concerns (such as, who's in charge here) were so frequent in this low-budget, horror flick that, sure enough, it became downright laughable after awhile, and not in the least bit frightening.Yes. When all hell finally breaks loose in Rec things certainly did get mighty deranged and twisted, alright. But, unfortunately, things also got unbelievably confused and sloppy, too.The gravest mistake that Rec made was to try to cram the following 4 horror movie sub-genres into its story - Zombies, virus infection, supernatural, and demon possession. And, on top of that, its story lead to no real conclusion, whatsoever.Even though having to read sub-titles greatly distracted this viewer from getting completely involved in the story, Rec did actually contain a couple of first-rate moments of the truly horrific kind.But, after all was said and done, Rec (with its 80-minute running time) was only an average fright flick, at best.",REC
46,dee.reid,"""Rec""",10,14 July 2009,"The Spanish-language horror film ""Rec"" was a scary haunted house movie. It was completed in 2007 and won dozens of awards in its native Spain, but was relatively unknown to American audiences until the fall of last year when it was remade as ""Quarantine."" I'll be one of the few to say that I really liked ""Quarantine."" I thought it was well-shot, well-acted and above all, scary.But if ""Quarantine"" was scary, ""Rec"" is down-right terrifying. From the co-directing powerhouse of Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza and using the first-person hand-held camera documentary-style narrative popularized in films such as ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) and ""Cloverfield"" (2008), ""Rec"" follows a beautiful young reporter and her cameraman as they shadow a crew of Spanish firefighters on their nightly rounds around the city. Things perk up when they receive a call to a disturbance at an apartment building involving an elderly woman who is locked in her apartment. As you would have it, all hell breaks loose since opening the locked apartment is like unlocking a Pandora's Box of ghastly horrors...""Rec"" doesn't play when it comes to delivering the scares. Things start to go downhill from the get-go. Also, there is no subtext, no hidden meaning in this film that attempts to explain the on-screen terror. It's only concerned with delivering pure terror and chaos, and this is what it succeeds in doing on multiple levels.I personally feel ""Rec"" is the better film of the two. ""Quarantine"" has the benefit of actually being one of the few Americanizations of foreign-language horror films in recent years to come close to actually matching the effect of the original. While both movies are essentially the same thing with a few minor changes and differences in certain plot details, ""Quarantine"" stands by itself in delivering the goods as a solid American remake.Only recently have Americans, however, had the pleasure of experiencing ""Rec"" in all its terror and infamy.10/10",REC

The Blair Witch / Paranormal Activity thing has been done a dozen times over by now, with varying degrees of believability and success, but this is one of the better examples of what the format can do. Starting slow with a series of missed cues and tame vignettes for the camera that introduce the primary characters, (a cute minor TV personality and the two generic firemen who allow her to tag along for the evening) it slowly, deliberately adds new faces and developments, building tension until everything finally boils over in a geyser of chaos and terror. Working wonders with a small cast of unknowns, it wrings every bit of potential out of an admirably simple concept without stretching beyond its means. The storyline is equal parts quiet suspense and startling horror, masking its budgetary shortcomings with a temperamental light source and a set of large-lunged ladies. I'm not often one to take the bait and jump during this kind of flick, but even I have to admit it caught me once or twice. A solid, entertaining ball of dread that reaches and surpasses the limits of its overplayed genre, it's great material for a dark, windy night at home.",REC
50,MBunge,A Spanish horror flick that loses nothing in translation,7,23 July 2010,"Rec is the Spanish film that was remade in America and called Quarantine. The basic stories are almost exactly the same, but noticing the many little differences between the movies are almost more entertaining than these two fine films are on their own.Angela Videl (Manuela Velasco) is a reporter for a late night infotainment show in Spain. She and her cameraman Pablo (Pablo Rosso) are spending a night filming at a fire station, giving their viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of firefighters. Then a call comes in of a problem at an apartment building and Angela and Pablo accompany two firefighters named Manu (Ferran Terraza) and Alex (David Vert) inside. There they discover that something is transforming the residents of the building into crazed cannibals and with the police blocking anyone from getting out of the building, the footage Pablo is shooting through the ordeal might be the only thing that survives.Rec and Quarantine are both neat little horror films. They're each fast and frightening and ferocious. Yet even though they're virtually the same movie, I'd recommend you watch them both to appreciate their subtle distinctions.Firstly, the cast of Rec is not nearly as pretty as the cast of Quarantine. Manuela Velasco is just barely attractive enough to make it as a real reporter on CNN. She wouldn't make it on the air at FOX or MSNBC, let alone pass as a Hollywood starlet. Even the character actors in Quarantine are much more attractive than their counterparts in Rec. The thespians of Rec are just as talented and skilled as their American cousins, but it's always a bit startling to clearly see how much more physical beauty in prioritized in U.S. cinema.Secondly, Rec has a much more raw and realistic feel to it while Quarantine is a bigger and more polished production. They're both trying to simulate the look of real, hand held video footage but Rec much more closely resembles such real footage. That means that Quarantine is a better and more interesting looking film most of the time, but Rec manages to achieve a more visceral sense of presence. Let me give you an example of the difference. There's a moment in Quarantine where one of the cannibals is beaten to death with the camera, with the audience's point-of-view smashing repeatedly into the cannibal's face. It's an incredible sequence, but in real life it wouldn't be nearly that clear and clean visually. In Rec, there are moments where the audio cuts out like it would in a real life situation and the filmmakers use it to great dramatic effect and leave the audience desperately wondering what they're not hearing.Rec is a shorter film and spends less time on characterization or explaining what's happening. Quarantine does a much better job of fleshing out the story and answering any questions that may pop into the mind of a viewer. So the Spanish film generates a greater sense of fearful mystery but the American flick trades more on a sense of impending doom and the possibility of escaping it. Rec is like being in the middle of a dark forest, waiting for something to jump out at you. Quarantine is more like running through a dark tunnel toward the light, worrying about what might be behind you.These movies also offer up two different reasons for the cannibalistic outbreak and frankly, the American one makes sense and the Spanish one doesn't. However, the bizarre nature of the Spanish rationale does enhance the scary creepiness of its conclusion. The ending of Rec is much more striking and better done than the ending of Quarantine, even though the rest of the American version is more visually powerful and well executed than its Spanish forerunner.Both of these movies are well worth watching. If you watch Rec first, you'll probably have a greater appreciation of how Quarantine improves on it. If you watch the American film first, you'll probably get even more of a thrill from the moments when the Spanish filmmakers give a slightly different wrinkle to the tale. If only every original film and its remake were as remarkable as these two.",REC

Inside are a couple of cops and the tenants of the apartment house. There are only a few of them. The reporter tells her camera guy to tape everything no matter what. He dutifully complies.Once they authorities meet up with the old woman she attacks and bites one of them. Eventually a man from the health authorities enters the building to check on the situation. He's mostly concerned with the injured who die and come back to life to attack the living. What ensues is panic and hysteria.The last 10 minutes things become interesting when the survivors find a room covered with newspaper articles of a possessed girl. This promises that we'll get a bit of a story, but we only get hints. Worst of all, the last minutes are filmed in old-green nightvision.This movie has a couple of good very good scares. It has somewhat of a story that while ignored during most of the movie gets really interesting at the end. What ruins this movie is the stupidity of the characters. Not one makes a reasonable decision, not even the trained authorities. Everyone is in a loud hysteria and panic. There's an awful lot of screaming and shouting as in all these fake reality-based horror movies. The cameraman doesn't stop filming no matter who is suffering or dying around him. The whole-camera centered worldview is getting sooo old, it's hard to stomach.

54,valleyjohn,Forget the remake this is the one to watch,9,27 December 2008,"[.REC] (2007) - My Review If there is any movie genre that is tired and lacking in ideas at the moment it is the Horror Genre. I am please to say that the reports of the horror movie's demise is exaggerated thanks to gems like [.REC]. When the firefighters receive a distress call from a nearby apartment building. An elderly woman has become locked in her apartment; a routine call by any account. The police are already on the scene, so now it's up to firemen Manu and Alex to break down the door and ensure that no harm has come to her. Upon arriving at the building, everything appears normal. But the calm atmosphere at the moment betrays the horrors that begin to unfold after the firemen break down the tenant's door and experience something that no one would believe had it not been captured on camera. Later, as the building is surrounded and quarantined, Pablo continues to roll tape to ensure that whatever the outcome of this terrifying situation may be, there will be some evidence to ensure that the truth gets out.It's strange that the best horror movies over the last five or more years are not from America. The States has always traditionally been the home of the Horror movie but not any more it seems [.REC] is a Spanish movie and unsurprisingly has just been remade for an American audience....WHY!!!! I'm not sure why my friends from across the pond have a problem with subtitles? I suspect most don't, but its the cheap and lazy option for the film companies. I find the best films are subtitled. It makes you concentrate far more on the film. In a way it's like watching a film and reading a book at the same time.One thing i ask is please don't watch the remake. You know it's going to be crap. Watch the original. It's terrifying! Without a doubt this is the scariest movie i have seen this year and is probably in my top 10 scariest movies ever.There is one scene where one of the infected falls from a stairwell and lands near a group of people and when this was shot the actors were not told it was going to happen so their reactions were genuine.The premise is simple, the make up and special affects are first class . The Handy cam works superbly and adds to the feeling of being there. The ending isn't schmaltzy and full of bull although i wouldn't be surprised if the remake is sugar coated for the US audience.On the cover of the DVD it is described as a cross between Blair Witch and 28 days later and while i can see where they are coming from with this description it's actually better than both of those movies. If you after a short , sharp , shock of a movie then [.REC] is the perfect solution but be warned it's not for the faint hearted![.REC] 2 is now being filmed in Spain and i cant wait to see it!9 out of 10",REC
55,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Freaky Found Footage Film with Good Writing,10,12 October 2019,"To start this off, I have to admit that I saw the American remake first, Quarantine. I was in college still and I would see most of the new horror films at the time. I really dug it and it wasn't until a bit afterwards that I realized it was actually a remake. I'm pretty sure I saw that one once and it's been a long time for me to finally see this one, even though I've heard so many good things. The synopsis here is a television reporter and cameraman follow emergency workers into a dark apartment building and is quickly locked inside with something terrifying.We start this off with Ángela (Manuela Velasco) as she does her intro for the show he hosts called 'While You're Sleeping'. It showcases jobs that happen while most everyone else is asleep. She is there with her camera man Pablo (Pablo Rosso), who we never really see, but we hear his voice. For their next episode, they're in a firehouse and going to be following two firefighters, Manu (Ferran Terraza) and Álex (David Vert). It shows a normal night until an alarm sounds. They get into a vehicle and head to an apartment building.They learn from people in the lobby what happened when they arrive. Down there are an elderly couple of María Teresa Ortega and Manuel Bronchud, with María making the call after she hearing screaming. There is also a hysterical mother, Maria Lanau, with her daughter Jennifer (Claudia Silva). She is a sick with what her mother believes to be tonsillitis. Also there is a Japanese couple with their child and a medical intern Guillem (Carlos Vicente). I should point out that many of these characters do not have names so I'm giving the actors names instead.The police arrived first with an older one, Vicente Gil, and a younger one, Jorge-Yamam Serrano. They're not thrilled about the film crew here and Serrano constantly wants them to stop filming. They go up to the apartment where the screaming was coming from and it belongs to an older lady, Sra. Izquierdo (Martha Carbondell). They go in and she is standing there. They go to help her and she bites Vincente in the neck. They knock her out and take him downstairs. As they try to leave, they're sealed in by a medical team. They're told to stay back and wait for the health inspector as they're under quarantine for the time being.We quickly see the deterioration of humanity when Álex falls from a couple stories on to his head and the residents start to blame each other for what caused this infection. Serrano and Manu try to keep everyone calm as they work out what is going on here and to find a way out. There's much more to the story as Ángela interviews the residents and this apartment is harboring a dark secret.As I'm starting to write my analysis, you know that I've already seen the remake and I've also heard a couple podcasts break this film down. I didn't think that it would ruin the film, assuming that this version wasn't too much different from the one I had seen previously. I can say that I see why this one is better now after this viewing.The first thing I should cover is that this is found footage. As a story guy, I really need a good reason for someone to be filming everything and why do they have the camera in hand at all times. I think this one presents a great story there. We have this documentary film crew who happens to be stuck in what is happening. You get the feel that the government is going to cover this up, so we have them filming everything to ensure that the truth gets out. I'm not going to lie though, even though I had an idea of the ending, I still feel like despite their efforts, they aren't going to make it out of here. Any time you get a government cover up, you have that glimmer of hope that you know is ill advised.I want to transition to what this film really becomes, which is an infected film. Much like 28 Days Later, I don't consider this a zombie movie. I think that is a subgenre from the zombie film, but these are definitely infected people. Much like the other film I referenced, it does feel like a form of rabies. There is also a bit of a religious angle here that I love. It is very subtle and late in the film, but this idea of how to explain a very common horror film concept is amazing to me. Taking it a step farther, it actually has an interesting idea of how it is working here that is different from things in the past.The last aspect of the story to cover is the deterioration of society. If you know me personally, you know that I'm a generally positive person in my life, but overall on humanity I'm extremely nihilistic. I just don't think humanity is a good thing for this planet, but I'm making the best of my existence. I bring this up because I love to see what happens when you isolate people like we get here and see how they immediately turn on each other. We have Serrano who takes his fear out on Pablo and Ángela for wanting to film this. The hysterical mother and others blame the Japanese family, because their culture is different. In times of crisis, we see how quickly we breakdown to primal ways.That will take me to the pacing of the film. This doesn't waste any time getting into introducing our characters and the premise of what we are going to see. We get to the apartment building quickly and it doesn't take long for the first attack as well as them being sealed in. It does slow down a bit in the later second act, but we need that for important bits of information for the climax and ending. There are subtle things that we get that pay off big, which I love. This film also has a shot runtime of 78 minutes and I think that helps. There's really no filler there. I do really enjoy how it plays out as it's an ending that I prefer.To the acting, I would say that for the most part it feels a bit amateur, but that's good. Velasco seems like a professional newsperson who is still pretty new to the game and that works for the type of show she's on. It is where someone would get their start. She does get a bit annoying, but I think that comes off realistic in the situation she finds herself. She is also quite attractive as well. Terraza is pretty solid and I like that he is the counter to Serrano who hates that he's being filmed. Rosso is good as the cameraman. I would say that the rest of the cast rounds out the film for what is needed. I also thought the infected people did well at being scary as well. No one stands out, but if I'm honest, I'm glad they don't. I think that could take away some of the realistic feel to the movie.As for the effects, I'm glad they didn't go heavy with them and stuck to practical. When you have CGI in a film like this, it can really change the feel and lose some of that realism. This didn't do that. I think the use of the hand held camera was good, it feels like we are right there with them. There's even a slight breaking of the fourth wall that works. I thought the look of the infected people was creepy as well.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film, which I'm glad to say there really isn't one. If they would have led of telling us that this footage was finally being released, then I'm okay with adding one since that is post-production. Since we are seeing this play out, I like that is just the ambient noise. We can hear though when characters are too far from the microphone and there are noises in the distance that really help to build tension. It was well done.Now with that said, I'm mad at myself for waiting so long to see this film. It is even crazier that I really like the remake and this one is definitely superior. I really like the concept here of this late night show filming this and they get caught in the nightmare. The explanation we get on what is causing this is quite natural and I can buy it. The acting fits for the found footage and I think that aspect is done very well to make it feel like this really happened. The effects are something else that was strong and the soundtrack definitely helps to build tension and keep that feel of realism. I really have no complaints and would highly recommend seeing this one. I will warn you though, this is a Spanish film so I had to watch it with subtitles. If that's an issue, I would avoid this.",REC
56,Seraphion,A nice new approach on the action zombie movies,7,1 July 2014,"The base premise for the story plot is another common stuff about zombie infection outbreak, nothing new. But the fresh new things like the reality show shooting style and the normal residential environment, with less military involvement, are making this movie quite interesting. The pace being built here feels a rather stupid for the starting ten minutes. But it increases up on the next five minutes or so. Then it is more of a stable quick paced roller coaster ride pace, with minor slow-downs at some 'interview' sessions. The acting is not a very good example for any reference, yet the shooting technicalities are exquisitely awesome. The director was brave to the risks of shooting long uncut scenes with short distances on gory scenes. That is something that's going to take more than one cut, because the window for covering up the fake makeup blood pieces is only a few short seconds. A 7 out of 10 is from me for this one",REC

58,Matt_Layden,Nice Addition To The Hand-held Camera Series.,8,20 July 2009,"If you haven't heard of this film, you may have heard of the Americanized counterpart, Quarantine. REC is the Spanish 'inspiration' for Quarantine. Or however you want to look at it. Both films play out essentially the same with tweaks here and there.What makes REC a better movie then Quarantine? Aside from the fact that it came out first and is scarier. It's the cast that makes this film work. The film is shot on a hand held camera, much like Blaire Witch Project and Cloverfield. Now what made those two films work is the same thing that made this film work, it's also the same thing that made Quarantine NOT work. The cast is basically unknown.If you want a more realistic tone in a film that basically requires the audience to believe that it's real, you can't have Tom Cruise running around in the film, or in Quarantine's case, Jay Hernandez.REC is a well done horror film, the atmosphere is claustrophobic and it works. The use of the crappy camera indeed adds to the experience. I guess what you really want to know is if you will get 'motion sickness' from the shaky camera. Well, I never experienced this, nor did I experience it in Cloverfield or Blair Witch Project, but I suppose it will annoy some people. Although, it's not AS bad as Cloverfield. Since the character in that film was a run of the mill citizen, and in here it's a professional camera person.It has some good scares and some scary moments. I enjoyed this more then Quarantine. Both films play out almost exactly the same, so if you've seen one you've seen the other. The ending is different though, and I prefer this one rather then the new one. If you really want to see both, go ahead, but if you had to pick one, I would suggest this one.It has subtitles though....and I know that may put off some people, especially in a horror film in which you lose some of the tension, because you have to read what's going on and might miss some of the scary bits.",REC
59,lewiskendell,One of the best horror movies since 28 Days Later and The Descent.,8,30 May 2010,"I thought that since I had already seen Quarantine, Rec wouldn't be very frightening. Wrong. Rec scared the crap out of me all over again. There are enough twists and deviations between the two movies to make them both worth watching. And if you can manage to do that alone, at night, then you are a rare breed.Honestly, the movie is almost TOO frightening. Sometimes the tension and dread gets to such a high level that it's nearly impossible to watch. Hands down, this is my favorite horror movie since The Descent.

60,begob,Good ending,6,7 September 2014,"Basic zombie situation, but a good set up - a group of strangers trapped in a quarantined apartment house with residents infected by something that makes them turn feral and kill.I had a lot of problems throughout. First the hand-held POV was way too jerky, with actors obscuring the view, but that did settle down.Second, there was way too much pointless talk as people panicked, and if they'd cut out 90% of the times someone said, ""What the F is going on?"" there still would have been too many. Also, ""Turn that Fing camera off!"" We get the point after the first couple of times.Third, the heroine is annoying. She starts out charming, becomes self-important and bossy, and ends up sobbing so much I wanted her to get chewed. I felt sorry for her cameraman, who was the only one to keep calm amongst a bunch of idiots.The distress should come in waves, not as constant sound torture via dialogue.But after all that, the ending is an unusual reveal for a zombie story. Surprising and very creepy. Well worth the wait.",REC

This IS Scary!,8,17 April 2008,"While covering the night shift at a small-town fire department, an ambitious young television reporter and her cameraman follow the crew on a call to rescue an elderly woman unable to escape the inferno that is consuming her home. Upon their arrival at the scene, the calm midnight air is pierced by the sound of horrific screams, and the television report takes an unexpectedly dark turn.If you know me, you know that I rarely get scared when watching horror films. Honestly, the only horror films that I got scared of was ""The Ring,"" ""The Grudge,"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" all which are remakes. Now, don't judge me because of that. Believe me when I say this: This movie is scary as hell!We are in an age of movies shot in hand-held camcorders. The ones released and going to be released this year were ""Cloverfield,"" ""Poughkeepsie Tapes,"" ""Diary of the Dead,"" and the remake of this film itself, ""Quarantine."" So I'm assuming many people saw ""Cloverfield."" Well, imagine ""Cloverfield,"" with less shaky-ness, 10 times scarier, and well, better.I don't know about you but I really love these types of camcorder-type films. It's more realistic. And who would've guessed? I'm actually scared of zombies for the very first time, after seeing this film! Usually, zombies are just slow moving creatures that are dumb (with an exception of the Dawn of the Dead remake). Well, in this film, they look really scary, the act smart, and they run!Now let's go back at thinking ""Cloverfield."" Many people have complained it didn't answer anything. Well, fortunately, this answers some things. However, I found that the weak spot of the film. I thought the whole explanations of how this whole thing started is kind of stupid and dumb. Other than that, the film is really fantastic!Sure, there aren't any amazing dialog and there are some clichés here but all can be forgiven once you're scared out of your wits and that you're really entertained from beginning to end! The performances were good and the film will put you at the edge-of-your-seats throughout! This will stick into your mind and possibly give you some nightmares.

Manuela Velasco doing her TV shows covering a night with the firefighters. That night the firefighters get a call to come to a building for rescue on entering the building they realize the building is contaminated and now no one can leave the premises. The movie is completely shot via handy cam so the shakiness is understandable and I think that made it more interesting. Manuela Velasco is superb and she makes this brilliantly. REC is really loud and scary no doubt about it. It will make you jump off your seat a hundred times at least. Must watch it All ALONE.,REC
65,chrichtonsworld,Brilliant!,8,15 January 2009,"After Cloverfield and Diary of the Dead i wasn't really anxious to see this movie. But boy am I glad I did. This movie took me by surprise. It starts out slowly and immediately you begin to wonder what the big horror will be. Once the main characters (the news reporter and the cameraman who you can't see) arrive at the building you know that something will happen. But you never quite know what will happen since all the people seem real,so you don't expect weird things to happen. Even when it does,there is an atmosphere surrounding the movie that there is a perfect logical explanation for it all and that everything will be OK. From the first weird event to the next the tension rises and rises until the climax. The climax is predictable but still makes an impact. How? The ending plays with your childhood fears. You don't need fancy special fx. The only thing you need is light or the lack off. I didn't expect to be scared by this movie. But it did. For me there were two moments that stand out. And those two moments were enough to rate this movie higher than Cloverfield or Diary of the Dead. A must watch!",REC
66,oneguyrambling,OK - But hardly as revolutionary as it's made out to be.,6,27 October 2010,"I didn't know much about Rec as I was loading the disc, I didn't read the backcover blurb as the front cover sealed the deal.Angela is a spunky young reporter (from the look of her I would also guess ex-weathergirl), who hosts a late night ""Insomniac"" style show, minus the drinking and dick jokes called ""While You Sleep"". Pablo is her unseen cameraman and we all know he only exists as a character to justify why the events are being filmed in the first place.Tonight's taping is for a show based around the typical night of a Firehouse and the employees within, and for the first 12 minutes the movie does run like a sort of raw doco with interviews and interaction with the firemen that are simply an unrelated prelude to what follows.When your film is 77 minutes long you get into it quickly, so after 12 minutes the firehouse receives a call, not to a fire which is unfortunate for the doco, but to a disturbance at an apartment building, so off they go to the building which looks like it was designed with Resident Evil as a template, (the game, not the movies).The initial people involved include a couple of firemen, the building supervisor, a local policeman and some local tenants still in pyjamas. Initially it appears that an old lady on the first floor is in some distress for an unexplained reason, in investigating the disturbance something occurs that unleashes some form of virus that, as they all seem to do these days; turns those that come into contact into a zombie style unit.Without needing to go into specifics we can see what is coming, frantic dashes with much screaming, snarling and spitting, a guessing game as to who is next to be infected and who will get by, conspiracy theories, people selling out their former mates to save themselves and some lovely neck munching, all filmed in the now familiar shaky (but well focused) style of course.There's a nice scene towards the end, where the remaining survivors hole up in the uppermost apartment that was previously described as vacant... but is it? Part Blair Witch, part Silence of the Lambs night vision scene, it is well handled and a welcome relief to the bite and scratch that makes the 45 minutes immediately prior.Surely the hand held camera era is nearly past the use by date? Even if not this was an OK, formulaic piece that adds nothing to the zombie genre without poaching too much from anything made previous. The actress playing Angela is pretty cute and plays the role well with a bit of fire at appropriate times, which adds to the film's momentum where it is in danger of lagging.Fans of horror movie clichés, and I'm talking to young blokes here, will be disappointed that the director couldn't fit in one of the holy trinity of either the gratuitous shower, the unnecessary soaking of the white tank top (that she does wear) or the baffling sex scene between the heroine and ""some guy she just met"".Without going into spoilerific detail the finale has a very creepy tone, and some good makeup and I guess you would say character design when it comes to the zombies? Final Rating - 6 / 10. Nothing new, doesn't overstay the welcome. Makes good use of the standard conspiracy, misdirection and character tension that these movies need. Lead actress is cute and commits to the role, which is good as the film revolves around her.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com",REC

And, it's another movie that I wasn't completely scared by, (I find myself being scared less and less these days I guess) but this is a whole lot of fun. A variation of a haunted house if you will, a news team follows a fire department that has reports of an old woman behaving erratically. Once they're there, things rapidly go out of control. It's a mix of Blair Witch, Resident Evil and Night Of The Living Dead. Great premise, great execution as well. It's like a living haunted mansion ride almost. Great fun.

68,ElijahCSkuggs,"It's my turn to scream......eh, forget it.",6,1 April 2008,"Oh goody, another hyped up flick that I just happened to hear about, and luckily I was able to catch it. Truthfully I had no clue what I was heading into. I heard that most people are really loving the hell out of it. But for this picky guy, there were far too many aspects to the movie I felt were overused and overdone.Story begins with a late-night TV crew doing a spot with a local Fire Station Department. Part of the in-depth interview is to go with a crew on one of their calls. Which they do, and which is where the action begins. They hit up a call at an apartment building where some chaos is supposedly being taken place. Well, you bet your ass there's something crazy going on. Within minutes of meeting the initial problem, the movie takes a sharp turn into complete hecticness. But it's consistently hectic, which is a good thing, right?REC started off alright, with a very open setting that delivers lots of expectations. Though, I felt it used very similar things I've seen in the past. It also used the two ""scare factors"" that I truly find cheap in making a horror flick. A combination of fast glimpses of a horrifying image/video and loud noise/sound. An example, the trailer for that Jessica Alba flick....was it the remake of The Eye...I forget. It showed a barren room, then out of nowhere a zombie jumps in front of the camera mixing with a loud scream mixed with sound effects. It's pure bullsh!t in my opinion, and if used more than once will begin to ruin the movie for me. Unfortunately REC used this tactic too many times. So much so, you can predict when it was going to occur. BUT, the movie does deliver a pretty good (some would say fantastic) atmosphere. It's also a very hectic movie that felt soooo hectic, I thought it began to feel unrealistic. So much so, it made the acting seem hit or miss. If there was one thing that would make me clear-headed and make myself judge a situation in a thoughtful manner is a situation like this. This is not the case for the people in this movie. Though again, in society, or at work, or on a sports team....people are always very confused about who the real leaders should be. Hell, at my work I've got 3 wannabe bosses. So I can relate, but this just felt a little too much. Too hectic, which made it distracting to the horror going on.You'll see reviews saying, ""just watch the last 10 minutes"". I can agree and disagree with this. First off, I disagree with this because this movie will arguably be a big hit with most people. The movie delivers a good setting, good performances for the most part, tension and jumps. But at the same time, the ending is by far the best part of this flick. It showed us a really frightening idea (unlike the BWProject) coming to fruition.REC is a pretty good flick. I didn't enjoy the movie for above reasons, but there are people out there that enjoy horror for the reasons I don't. That's fine. But I'll be on that other side saying, REC really didn't bring anything new to horror besides the story. I happen to believe Mulberry Street, a relatable flick is a better movie than this. Predictable, cheap scares, ""try-too-hard"" feeling of chaos, but a cool setting, cool ending and a consistent ride of horror. It's recommendable, but come on, it ain't perfect. 6 outta 10",REC
69,jaredmobarak,Don't you see my face is shiny?  {Rec},8,8 January 2009,"Here we have another example why people can't stand Hollywood. 2007 saw the release of the Spanish horror/thriller {Rec}, and instead of its great success bringing it overseas for a theatrical release, America decides to create its own water-downed version called Quarantine. These Spaniards have a knack for the scary these days. Think a mix between The Descent and Blair Witch Project and you will get an idea of what {Rec} is. It's all on a routine call to rescue a woman and get her to the hospital, but as you will see, thanks to a TV crew duo filming the firefighters on the job, it's not your run-of-the-mill simple task. With great foreshadowing in the truck, the driver saying they don't put the siren on for non-emergencies, the mission spirals out of control almost on arrival. Shot by the TV cameraman, the screen shakes and whips around to see what detail it canI'm sure Cloverfield took much from thisin a controlled chaos that feels ad-libbed yet you know it was all orchestrated to amp up the scares, keeping things out of view until the absolute final moment.Films like this have a tendency to contain some stilted acting, but that is not the case. Everyone involved comes across very naturally, as though it really is a found tape that documented the incident. Our entry point into the tale is Manuela Velasco's Ángela Vidal, a professional at her work, yet very casual to lend well to her show ""While We Were Asleep"". She keeps things light and jokey with the firefighters who explain that the odds of getting a fire call are slim to none; they will probably just need to rescue a pet if anything. The men she interviews come off as nervous in front of the camera, yet composed and confident when put into action. I am a believer in that fact being the sign of good performances. The heroic character, ""acting"" nervous and shy when the situation calls for it, like a bad actor, is the kind of role I enjoy. One of my favorite moments comes when Ángela interviews César and he thinks it's this flashy thing that he must prepare and look his best for. When told the camera is rolling, he puts his finger to his chin and poses to look educated and important. It's a great bit part from Carlos Lasarte.What really makes the film a success, though, is the break-neck pace and lack of information. We as an audience are on the same boat as the characters in the apartment building, being quarantined due to the chance of a fatal disease being on the loose. No one knows what is happening, not even the policeman locked inside as well. Only when a Health Inspector enters do some questions get answered, but the full-scope of what is happening won't have light shed upon it until the very end. The zombie aspect of what is trapped inside with them plays out beautifully as it is never blatantly shown. To compare again with the great British flick The Descent, darkness shrouds the creatures lurking and the camera serves as its own blockade too. Even when they are shown, it's mostly as stationary, harmless people, until they attack. All involved feel no remorse in their bid to survive, killingor thinking they've killedanyone in the way without a second thought.The actors are all just a part of the story, we never get any background information, nor do we need it. This is meant to be a filmed account of an incident that the authorities would do their best to keep under wraps, and if I was to compare to the numerous others I've seen like it, {Rec} achieves the aesthetic best. Yes, I think Cloverfield is a better film, but that is because it is a film, whereas this is a hand-held event, without the necessity for a three-act structure; it just is what it is. Everything becomes a part of the whole, no one stands out as a lead or hero or villain. In the end, every person trapped inside is just one more piece of food for the infected to hunt and devour; no one is any better than the next.And while the whole thing moves forward without a break, inevitably showing how they have been left inside, not to discover who will survive and who won't, but to contain the disease and destroy every last trace, it all culminates and leads towards the ending. The final ten minutes or so, finally unveiling what had been going on to unleash this horror, is absolutely superb. Shot with the flash bulb of the camera, the light is dim, darkness always creeping in at the edges, until even that becomes broken. But it only gets better as a result, the camera switching to the night-vision's narrow sphere of sight, showing everything in a gray/green negative. What occurs is pretty harrowing and gruesome, but it's shot with such care for realism that it becomes the ultimate conclusion for what has occurred. Just a brilliant final shot to end the horror; I can't believe directors Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza would risk ruining it with the in production sequel {Rec} 2. Hopefully it will be relevant, if unnecessary. It's easy to say America wants the money and to not have to read Spanish subtitles, hence remaking it just a short year later, but to have the original minds risk credibility with a sequel, you have to hope it's a story that deserves to be told and not a cheap way to make more cash.",REC
70,Andy-296,Solid Spanish made zombie film,7,25 May 2009,"This Spanish zombie film (not many examples of that particular genre, I guess) is a very solid horror film. An almost unbearably perky reporter from a local TV show in Madrid covers the night round of the firefighters. When they are called to a crumbling apartment for some not very clear reason, the reporter will get far more than she bargained for - the place has been contaminated by zombies, and is soon cordoned off by the police; she will have to fight off, along with the cameraman, all the apartment's inhabitants that have been turned into zombies. Remade by Hollywood as Quarantine, this film is very well done, even if the constant use of a hand-held camera is probably going to make many members of the audience dizzy while watching it (it happen to me, who watch it in a theater in first row, no less)",REC
71,KnightsofNi11,Terrifying,8,16 January 2011,"The horror genre gets a bad rep because of how many awful movies come out of the genre. In this day and age, about 75% of all horror films are a complete waste of time. But every once in a while a film pops up that deserves a spot in the other 25%. Rec is one of those films. It's a Spanish horror film, filmed entirely in first person camera point of view, ala The Blair Witch Project. This filmmaking style throws you right in the middle of the thrilling action and I can honestly say that I don't remember a movie released in recent years that has scared me this much. The film begins by introducing us to a news reporter, the main character of the film, and her cameraman. They are doing a segment for their station about firemen working the night shift. Things are really slow until they get called to an apartment where an old woman is locked in her room. Everything is going fine until the story unfolds to reveal there is an infection in the apartment that is turning people into rabid killing machines and the government has quarantined the building. What ensues is a roller-coaster of thrills and suspense that scared me so much more than I expected.Rec clocks in at a mere 78 minutes, but it makes the most out of each minute. The films is paced really well and it develops just like good horror does. It begins with about a six or seven minute exposition which sets up the characters and introduces us to the main story of the reporter documenting the firehouse. A little less than ten minutes in the firemen get the call to the apartment and head on over. When they get there, there is still no sense of danger within the characters, but we the audience know they are in for something. A few minutes later they have encountered their first threat, the zombified old woman, and the fun begins. The film uses its time effectively not dwelling on thing that don't matter. Horrors unfold and a mystery unravels. The whole film is at a very high intensity level that keeps you on edge and uncomfortable. The entire middle of the film is very strong and it never lags. The end of the film is where the movie takes its biggest punch. The last 15 minutes of Rec are some of the most intense and heart pumping moments I've ever experienced in a film. I was absolutely terrified for the last moments of this film. There are times when you even know what to expect, but when it actually happens you are still caught off guard and scared to death. I'm not sure I've ever seen a more effective use of a 78 minute runtime.Rec spans a great range of horror. It has its quiet suspenseful moments that keep you tense with anticipation, but also your fast paced action horror where we see things absolutely horrific and unforgettable. This movie is horror done right, using its full potential to thrill its audience. This movie finds a perfect balance between insane graphic horror and silliness. Nothing in this film is cheesy and it is all scary. This isn't a film I would recommend to the faint of heart, but I would recommend it to everybody else. My only tiff with this film would be some of the dialouge at points. Because of the first person authentic feel of this film the dialouge has a very ad-lib feel to it and in fact may very well have been ad-libbed at points. This works sometimes and doesn't work other times. It isn't something that ruins the movie or even detracts from what is truly great about this film. Rec is incredibly scary and it is a great watch if you want to be scared.",REC
72,ajs-10,Very atmospheric and genuinely scary!...,9,20 June 2011,"I first have to admit to having seen the Hollywood treatment of this film in the guise of Quarantine (2008). To be honest, this telling of the story is far better in just about every way! It is very very creepy and I'm really glad I didn't watch it in the dead of night. It is a Spanish film (with subtitles) and it looks almost like a home movie, so I guess if you can't handle 'shakeycam', as I call it, then this is definitely not for you.A TV reporter, Ángela Vidal and her cameraman, Pablo, are doing a programme about what the Firemen do during the night. It all starts of light-hearted enough with a tour of the station and introductions with the two Firemen they will be following, Manu and Álex. Just when boredom was about to really set in they get a call. A woman has become trapped in her apartment and the Firemen are called to get her out. They arrive at the building and eventually open the door. The woman looks very distressed and an ambulance is called for. At this point she attacks one of the Policemen there, biting his face. They take him downstairs only to find the building has been sealed from the outside and the authorities will not allow anyone out. I'll leave it there so as not to incur the wrath of the 'Spoiler Police' and hope it's enough to peek you interest.It is all shot on one hand-held camera and so does suffer a little from 'shakeycam' as I mentioned earlier. This does not detract from what is a very atmospheric and genuinely scary movie. I can see why Hollywood remade it I just wish they had done half as good a job as these guys did. Good performances all round, particularly from; Manuela Velasco as Ángela Vidal, Ferran Terraza as Manu, Jorge-Yamam Serrano as Policía Joven, Pablo Rosso as Pablo and David Vert as Álex.I did find that the story did start to briefly fall a little flat in the middle, but it's only 75 minutes long, so it didn't last long. It is definitely one of the scariest things I've seen in a very long time. A really well thought out plot combined with some great performances make for an experience you won't forget in a hurry For those that like to be scared witless, highly recommended the rest of you watch at your peril.My Score: 8.6/10",REC
73,Darkside-Reviewer,Vomit inducing POV,3,30 May 2020,"The first time I watched REC was when it was first released on DVD everyone was raving about how good the movie was and that it was really innovative and new I watched it and was unimpressed by it but I recently decided to give the movie another chance in 2020 and my opinion on it has not improved it's actually gotten worse because of just how many other crappy ""horror movies"" tried to copy it's not so great ideas.REC is a Spanish horror movie that's main gimmick is that it's filmed entirely in POV meaning (Point of view) so the movie is presented in a way that's meant to make the audience feel like they are in the characters shoes making for a ""unique"" viewing experience another movie that is famous for being filmed entirely in POV is the Disaster/Monster movie Cloverfield so if you found that movie unwatchable due to motion sickness then this isn't the movie for you.The story and script for the movie is actually pretty decent and had a lot of potential to make a great Zombie/Infected horror movie but sadly the infected humans in this movie don't have a lot of detail put into their appearance and there's no decent shots of what they look like don't get me wrong they do show the infected people but clever camera techniques are used to keep you from seeing any of the smaller details like for example cheap make up and effects this is done by keeping the infected people in dark areas and at a distance and with the camera shaking constantly from the POV camera work you don't always get a clear and accurate view of what's going on there are times when the infected people chase the survivors or are close to the camera when attacking or running but again the camera is constantly shaking and everything just kind of blurs together making what should be a tense scene a blurry mess you know whats going on but you don't get a chance to take in what's happening.I have no love for POV movies horror or otherwise and sadly because this movie was successful it got a Hollywood style remake called Quarantine which actually turned out even worse there are even crappy sequels to this movie that are laughably bad.I don't recommend watching this movie it's over rated, not scary and causes motion sickness after just ten minutes.",REC

Had they steadied the camera a little more I think this would have been a really good horror movie. There is plenty of heightened suspense and sometimes the scariest movies are the ones in another language. Even if they are verbally a bad actor but great with facial expressions then it appears that they are doing a fantastic job. Spanish people may have a different opinion.I look forward to watching the rest of the series to see if they can reproduce the same level of fear and suspense while keeping the plot line fresh. 6/10 (It would have been a 7 but the shaky camera was really distracting).,REC

76,LoneWolfAndCub,I haven't gasped during a movie in years until I saw this...,9,2 July 2008,"It might not be the greatest selling point, but REC is the first movie in about 2 years that has genuinely made me jump and gasp. Effective and tense throughout, co-directors Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza have employed the hand-held camera technique and used it believably. There were no moments in the movie when I thought ""just drop the camera and run!"" because there were logical and reasonable explanations for keeping it (unlike ""Cloverfield""). Surprisingly, the movie is driven by characters and plot for the first half, rather than gore gore gore. The story moves briskly and sensibly, and is always interesting. Every actor is exceptional, there is no weak link in the cast. Manuela Velasco is the standout as Angela, TV reporter who carries the bulk of the film. She is a lively, beautiful and talented young actress who managed to hold the last half of the film well.Although the story is not 100% original, it is a unique take and therefore does not seem too much like a rip-off. Moreover, the realistic and human decisions the characters make help add a sense of believability to the situation. The location of the apartment building is suitably claustrophobic and Balaguero and Plaza use it to their advantage. Accompanying the location, lighting plays a major role in the atmosphere, with the camera light providing some awesome frights. There are four moments in this film that honestly scared the crap out of me! Thankfully, shaky cam has no role in these scares, as both directors obviously saw that a shaky camera does not equal a good movie. Sure, the camera does shake, but only when it is bumped or the cameraman falls (and it is never over-the-top). I doubt anyone could get sick from this (again, unlike ""Cloverfield,"" which was not bad, do not get me wrong).REC proved that the Spanish have a way with horror (also see ""The Orphanage"".) This is 100 times better than any of the American trash plaguing cinemas now. This is scary, interesting, immersive and an original take on a worn out genre.4½/5",REC

When a distress call from a nearby building comes through, Ángela goes with the fire crew to capture it all on film, but not long after they arrive things soon start going from bad to worse. They quickly find out that there's a deadly infection within the building and before long the building is on lock down for quarantine. What was supposed to be just a fun ride-along soon turns into a deadly nightmare and a fight for survival.I actually didn't know anything about REC until after I watched Quarantine, the American version of the film. I'm glad I did find out about it because REC is just as enjoyable as the American remake in my opinion. Both films for me are as enjoyable as the other, and both are just as creepy as well, with the end scenes being by far the creepiest. I know you'll get the people who'll rate REC better purely because it was the original one, but just because it was the original one that doesn't always automatically make it better.What makes REC (and Quarantine for that matter) more disturbing as well are the great sound effects they use, especially for the infected people. It's the sort of sound that sticks with you and it's done really well. The setting is a good one also because at first you may think what can be so scary about an apartment block, but when you think about it, it's actually like a maze. Put that in with the element of people getting infected from a deadly disease and seeing it all from the POV of Pablo you have a really good creepy film.While not the best ""lost footage found""/POV film there is, it's definitely ONE of the best.

I'd been told that it was quite good, but never really knew what to expect. I'm happy to say that I was very impressed. The plot of Rec is quite basic. There are people going crazy and attacking people from within a building and everyone is forced to stay inside. However, it's impressive because of how small the building is. The movie manages to pull off an 80-minute run time in such a small space, and it works perfectly. While 80 minutes is very short for a movie, Rec is paced extremely well. It feels longer than it actually is, and in the case of this movie, that's a good thing. Every moment is fantastic and tense. You never really know what's about to happen. I think that if it were even longer I would still love it, but it still ended at a good time. It never wore out its welcome, and it refused to risk potentially doing so, which was a good move on the directors' part (just in case). The characters are great. The found-footage style certainly adds to it, as the movie feels less like a movie and more like something that actually happened. It gives it a realistic feel right off the bat, but everyone's acting is still superb on top of that. They feel genuinely scared (or full of whatever emotion they're trying to portray), and considering the situation, they have every right to be. Not only that, but the characters aren't all complete idiots. The main characters have reason to be where they are, as well as hold a camera and record. It never feels like the found-footage style is being forced in. Overall Rec is absolutely amazing. It's extremely intense, extremely well-acted, extremely well-paced, and filled with great characters. Save for a few inconsistencies or issues I noticed here and there, it was perfect. However, these issues are so minuscule that I can see myself possibly giving this movie a 10/10 in the future. In the end I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror and/or thrillers or just anyone looking for and amazing, tightly cramped, action- packed, thrill-ride of a movie.",REC

82,Shattered_Wake,One of the most terrifying films ever made,9,10 August 2008,"A reporter, (Manuela Velasco), follows a group of firefighters for her late-night show While You Sleep. After joining them on a seemingly routine call to an apartment complex, Angela and the rest of her crew are quarantined inside of the apartment building due to an unknown virus which is turning the tenants into ravenous monsters.This is, without a doubt, one of the top few most terrifying films that have been released for a long, long time. The story is simple, but effective. The writing works well and manages to be realistic, as is the camera-work. The realism of the camera-work, however, becomes a problem. Of all the POV horrors ('Blair Witch Project,' 'Diary of the Dead,' 'Cloverfield') of recent years, 'Rec.' does the worst job of showing what's actually going on. And, while I enjoyed that at some points. . . there are other parts where it became more annoying than effective. But, it's a small flaw that can easily be overlooked so that one can properly value the masterwork that this film actually is. The one thing that makes this so endlessly frightening is the way they go about the scares. One moment you're on the edge of your seat in simultaneous excitement and trying to figure out what the hell you're actually seeing on the screen. . . then the next minute, when it all hits clarity, you're thrown back in fear at some of the most terrifying images ever filmed. Very rarely have I ever encountered a film that could do that and do it well. While it's still on lockdown in the states so that people can't see it before the remake is released this Fall, I still highly, HIGHLY recommend doing whatever you can to see it. You will not want the effect of 'Rec.' to be ruined by what will probably be, simply, a subpar clone. If you want nightmares, see this film. You won't regret it. . . that is, if you're brave enough. . .Final verdict: 8.5/10.",REC

87,TwistedContent,The High-Tier Mockumentary/Found-Footage Horror Movie,9,7 May 2020,"Fourteen years ago, Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza, two Spanish directors with both feet already in the horror genre, joined forces to create their own awesome mockumentary horror, which has remained one of the primes examples in the (once big and now almost dead) myriad of found-footage/mockumentary horror movies. I can't say I have a crown put on any of them, but ""Noroi"", ""Grave Encounters"", ""Trollhunter"" and first two REC movies are some of my favorites.A rollercoaster ride every horror fan should try taking at least once, that's what REC is for the most part. Television reporter Angela (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman Pablo are making an episode about the work of firefighters, in process also tagging along them to a call for help from an apartment building in the city, where they soon get locked inside with something terrifying... The plot's simple and straight-forward, with a last minute twist, one which's value and necessity can be argued. There's not much of character development, no real psychological depth, no subtext or message, nothing of that sort. Having said that, the typical yet fully functional characters provided are more than enough. Some may say that there's not much acting to do in a film like this, but I concur, very good performances in the storm of fear and confusion. However, the main strength of REC lies in its edge-of-the-seat tension, atmosphere of terror, quick pacing, danger behind darkness and every camera turn, and, of course, the brutal jump scares. It's also undeniably shaky, loud and sometimes cinematographed & edited seemingly to a point of overkill, but some of it adds successful realism (and some raises eyebrows), but most of it simply makes it the genre that it is - found-footage. Whatever overkill can be find here, it definitely won't be connected to pacing, because the sweet'n'short 78-minute runtime packs a lot of entertainment and never leaves room for boredom. REC sets out to test your senses, and does so with the greatest effort.It's a great mockumentary, a good zombie film, and a movie that really doesn't pretend to be what it's not. Straight-forward and pretty confident. If You're looking for a wild and hysteric ride of horror shenanigans, I promise you'll like it, but otherwise this is not one that's famous for its substance.

This though has a seemingly more realistic excuse to use this particular filming style and it really does work. From the off it grabs you, it doesn't get bogged down with inane dialogue like Cloverfield did, even the banalities of Fire Station life hold your interest, a casual viewer of this film might just be fooled into believing it was a proper documentary. What marks this out as different is that its never predictable, in fact its hard to second guess what is going to happen, the way the film evolves and its relenting pace towards the end will keep you riveted. Easily one of the best Horror's of the decade, certainly one of the most ingenious. The scene with the possessed/ infected girl at the end was damn disturbing, although I'm not sure if it was because it was great horror film-making or because of just how emaciated the actress was.",REC
89,jamiedarlow-37510,One of the most frightening experiences....,10,17 February 2020,"I wish I could experience this film again for the first time; it was one hell of a ride. I've never had to stop a film for half an hour to get my breath back from the overwhelming tension that is in the ending scene of the film. The story focuses on Angela and Pablo; a small tv crew filming a piece on the everyday life of the local firemen for their reality documentary show. The fire crew get called in on this particular night to an apartment building where there has been a disturbance reported. Very quickly things start to turn upside down and after a violent attack from one of the residents, everyone without explanation is enforced to stay inside the building by the authorities. I think this is most probably the best found-footage film that has been created and there's been some damn good ones (Cloverfield and The Borderlands to name a couple) it's definately not for the faint hearted as there are some genuinely shocking jump scare moments; some of which the cast weren't even aware of until they happened on the day of shooting, adding even more to the unnerving sense of realism throughout. The cast are all brilliant with such natural performances that, with the combination of the well shot first person angles, make for a truly unique observation of fear. If you're a horror fan you need to see it and also check out REC. 2 which is a very impressive sequel from the same directors Paco Plaza and Jaume Balaguero. The last thing I will say is.... the last 10 minutes.... you may need a bit of a sit down and a stiff drink or good cuddle from a loved one to recover from it.

90,Cinema_Fan,A more realistic way in which to use the shaky cam'.,8,13 November 2008,"""While You're Asleep"" is a Spanish documentary television show that has Ángela Vidal, played by Manuela Velasco, and her cameraman Pablo, visiting a Barcelona fire station to follow their movements during the night. Done in the ""first-person"" (the showing of a film via the perspective of the viewer if they were actually there filming, as the case here, the T.V. cameraman) throughout. This faux style of documentary can be misleading to those unaware that is exactly that: false. If caught unaware this may seem to represent an actual T.V. documentary and to be caught off-guard would lead to some very interesting results. We are shown around the station and we see interviews of the firefighters as the night progresses, then, as the call comes in, they are off to assist an elderly woman trapped inside her apartmentIt is in this apartment block in the dead of night that the local residents, a smattering of strangers, the fire crew and our intrepid Ángela Vidal and her cameraman, encounter more than just things that go bump in the night. With the reality style of the hand-held camera movements that are seeing for us, this too could well be us, trapped now ourselves, because of dangerous contamination to others outside, inside with this tightly packed and fearful group of people. The fear factor kicks in almost immediately the first causality surfaces, as the first victim falls prey to this strange and unknown phenomenon; quickly spreading and dividing this tiny group, it isn't long before this claustrophobic atmosphere become a melting pot of paranoia, high anxiety and death. With this camera technique we are more than drawn into this nightmare scenario, we are giving a pace that quickens with each passing minute and we are being delivered and being witness to a dramatic hell. Written and directed by Jaume Balagueró who has extended the realism by using only true locations, such as the fire station and the apartment block, it is with this cinematic experience, that the turmoil escalates to violent proportions we can truly see, with our own eyes why such a film has had its fair share of Awards. Winning the Silver Scream Award of the 2008 Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival, the Fantasporto Audience Jury Award and Best Film and The Goya Award for Best Editing and Best New Actress for Manuela Velasco, and deservedly so. With other winnings for Best Director when not being nominated or coming in second place, this, for such a short running time of 80 minutes is more than adequate to deliver a longer lasting impression of its extreme high shock value that will always be top billing to its quickening pace and daring technique. Dare you rewind and press PLAY???",REC
91,flicklover,THE BEST FILM OF ITS KIND EVER!!!,10,29 November 2018,I have been on a horror film kick lately. Looking at best of horror film lists to get recommendations on films to see. On almost all the lists REC was on them. It is a Spanish film that had come out in 2007 but I had never heard of it. I read up and it seemed that it had quite a following. So I searched and was able to get to see it.I was a little apprehensive that it was a POV found footage film. The sub genre has been beat into the ground. But I went in with moderate expectations. After seeing REC I can say that I was blown away!!! It is the best film of it's kind that I have seen. The film is set in Spain. There is a a reporter named Angela and her cameraman shooting for a late night TV show in a firehouse. They follow the fire service on a call they received from an apartment building nearby. It seems that there was a woman that was distressed there so the firemen go to see what the problem is. They arrive in the womans apartment and see that she is very upset. In the middle of trying to calm her down the woman viciously attacks one of the officers biting him. What happens for the next 80 minutes is absolutely great adrenaline rush horror. Now we are told that the woman was infected by a virus that was similar to rabies. As it turns out the virus turns the infected into blood thirsty zombie/vampires! The building is suddenly put into lock down by the police and no one in the building can leave. The intensity of this film never lets up. They run around the building trying to find out what was going on and find that more people have been infected. The attacked come from everywhere. This film feels like being in a great haunted house! You never know when things are going to happen. I am not really a fan of zombie films but this one is different. It is done with such great timing and skill that it really seems that what is happening is real. For those looking for good character development this isn't for you. There are some truly scary moments. And the last 10 minutes are super intense.Because of its success REC was predictably remade for American audiences as QUARANTINE a couple of years later. I saw that film to compare and even though it is virtually a shot for shot remake it's not even close as effective as REC.,REC
92,Jacques98,For lack of better words: it's just nothing special.,7,11 November 2008,"""If it's American, it's bad. If it's foreign, it's good."" You've heard it all your life, especially with the Asian horror craze a few years ago, then now with the recent French horror craze. And, sorry to be honest, I've seen every foreign ""masterpiece"", and not one of them has ever given that argument a backbone. REC. is no different. At best, it's well-done, but sadly typical. At worst, it's unoriginal and just like everything else you've seen a thousand times.It always amuses me when I hear critics say things like, ""Oh, just another Saw sequel, nothing I haven't seen before . . ."" but then jump on the mindless bandwagon for movies like REC., which are just carbon copies of every other lame movie ever made. If you've seen any other hand-held camera movie, you've seen REC. If you've seen any other virus-turns-people-into-zombies movie, you've seen REC. The only thing that even hints at different is the confinement, and that is simply it. There is zero originality, and nothing that doesn't fit into the trite, safe, cliché horror box. REC. plays it safe. It brings back the stuff that made your great uncle shiver, and that is the single reason it's getting good reviews. It's safe. It's a proved formula, critically acclaimed in the past, viewer loved, and REC. doesn't take a single risk at trying to be different.I've grown up on video games like Resident Evil and played recent games like Condemned and BioShock, and it seems now Hollywood (and foreign filmmakers, as well) is trying to copy them. I have nothing against thatResident Evil and BioShock put 95% of horror movies to thumb-sucking shame, and if filmmakers want to put that on screen, I'm all for it. But with REC., they totally miss what makes those games so scary and engaging: originality. Bringing people to places they've never seen before, then trying to get them to explode in their pants. REC. does the exact opposite: it takes you to the familiar, then tries to scare you with the familiar. REC. is a giant cliché, and it looks like I'm the only one alive who realizes this. It uses scares you've seen in 1950's horror movies, let alone seen in the standard slasher remake. It rehashes horror grounds that you've tread on hundreds, if not thousands of times, then expects you to take it as if its oh-so-original and shocking. Sorry, kids who aren't even old enough to legally see this movie without a parent, and sorry old people who are so stuck in the cheesy horror past (with giant flesh-eating flies), anyone with a brain can say this is the most unoriginal movie to be this acclaimed in years.Despite the raving reviews that call this ""intense"", the vast majority of the runtime is nothing but people running (pun unintended). Run, scream, OH-SCARY-LITTLE-GIRL!, run, scream, run, run, scream. That's it. When I wasn't laughing at the absolute cheesiness of some of the scares, I was bored out of my mind! If they were to take out the amount of repeated scenes, the movie would be 15 minutes long. And those 15 minutes are almost entirely the slow, boring opening.With that said, there were some genuinely intenseif not clichédmoments in the end, and I wish a lot of other movies would have that. However, it's just style and no substance. I can care less what happens at that point in the movie because everything before it has been just boring and predictable.I'm not going to withhold the information that I viewed the remake, Quarantine, before I watched REC., and that may be why my opinion is so negative. I hated Quarantine for the same reasons I disliked REC., and though REC. is by far superior, Quarantine was much more intense and well-done. A lot of the scenes in REC. just looked sloppy compared to the scenes in Quarantine, and nowhere near as effective. But none of that really matters because both movies were patheticone was just a little better done (Quarantine), and one was a little more realistic and overall better (REC.).Overall, REC. isn't quite a waste of time, but it isn't a necessary watch, either. Don't go out of your way to veiw it, because if yourself up, you'll realize, ""Wait . . . this is exactly like every other standard horror movie! I feel cheated!"" like I did.I can guarantee in two days from now I'll forget I even watched this movie. More than anything, I just wish a movie could be memorable again, no matter what country made it.3/10",REC

Especially after all the hype over ""Did the filmmakers REALLY die?"" Of course, everyone nowadays knows that when a film includes: ""Based on real events"" half of the time, it's a lie. Watching BLAIR WITCH in the theater was an experience. Not necessarily a good experience, but I could see the future potential of other horror films done in what I call ""subjective camera style"" or ""scs"" for short. Sadly, most scs horrors that followed were either hum-drum or downright bad (CLOVERFIELD anybody?!) Then, along in 2007, came this movie from Spain. If you want to see a scs horror done right, watch this! REC tells the harrowing tale of a news crew following a team of firefighters one night, when they get a fateful call. Arriving at an apartment complex, they are soon beset by a crazed woman who proceeds to injure and kill one police officer and firefighter. But the horror is just beginning to mount as the residents soon realize that their building is under quarantine. From that moment on, the terror builds and doesn't let up as one by one, residents are infected and then turned into raging zombie-like crazies. The camera-work, acting, pacing, scripting, and special effects all combine to create a superb thriller. So many individual moments combine to keep us in a constant state of terror and claustrophobia. The brilliance of the filmmakers is that they've taken the concept of the zombie genre and turned it on its head. In zombie movies, survivors board themselves inside some place and fight to keep the monsters out. In REC, survivors are trapped inside with the monsters, and must resort to more drastic measures to find a way out. Be prepared to have your pulse race as fewer and fewer survivors remain, only to culminate in a bone-chilling finale!",REC

In this case a block of flats reports some strange goings on with one of the residents and both crews, camera and fire, end up sealed up as the authorities quarantine the building. At first it seems rather mundane until one of the firemen comes crashing to the ground floor in a pool of blood. Then the tension is racked up with a well put together story, some very good camera work and some damn fine acting. The US made a worthy remake of this with the very good Quarantine, although the stories differ quite radically, but the Spanish version is by far the best. It has an 'Alien' like feel with it's barely lit claustrophobic rooms and darkened corridors as the living feel their way upwards and downwards looking for a way out. The final 20 minutes are a masterclass in suspense and horror as we begin to discover what has been perpetrated here. And that is one of the most original and scary horror thrillers in decades.",REC
96,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Recording of Hell!!,8,6 October 2013,"Horror movies thrive on originality of their ideas. They follow the same pattern usually but the place, characters and elements of surprise make them look different from each other. Rec is one such journey, everything is normal initially, then innocents people get stuck in a hell like situation, there is nowhere to go and slowly all hell break loose. It's a zombie horror idea done brilliantly with the help of a twist that comes in the final 15 minutes that is where fear peaks, imagery and makeup haunts you like hell and movie becomes a classic in horror genre. This Spanish horror is the piece of sub-genre known as hand-held camera found footage movies. Rec gives you enough characters to root for, a lot of jump in seat moments and leaves you with doubts about the origin of the horror. If you think, you are not scared easily, try this alone.",REC

True, there is a slow start as the premise is setup, but ""REC"" picks up immensely once the crew arrive at the apartment block and mayhem breaks loose. Then ""REC"" becomes very violent, very bloody and very vicious indeed. ""REC"" comes across as kind of like ""The Blair Witch Project"", but with nothing hidden and everything on screen.I think that ""REC"" worked really well, and made the most of it's low budget limitations. I was going to write that it was the kind of project that would almost certainly be picked up as a remake candidate by Hollywood, and then I read on IMDb (hi guys!) that this has already happened. The Hollywood remake ""Quarantine"" is due out in the UK in October. I will probably see it (why not?) but it will have to be going some to beat ""REC"" for energy, excitement and good old fashioned gory thrills.",REC
98,datorsiers2,A cameraman who surely loves his job.,9,8 September 2017,"Definitely one of the ''realest'' horror movies out there, since it's meant to be a TV crew shooting a show of firemen doing their daily job. The movie looks as if it was filmed with a casual camera, so everything looks real, not to say it lacked in quality, by no means. The shaky camera depicting these events really makes you feel as you are trying to escape for your life yourself.Apart from the movie having a very realistic view, it also has awesome jump scares and manages to keep up the constant tense environment throughout the film, which most horror films fail to do. The screen time is fairly short, but in no way is that a problem with this film, since action being rather quickly it does not have to be dragged out to two hours or even more. We get to the action part 10 minutes in and it keeps on that way until the very end, which is a very unique approach for horror films, since people usually expect the character build up and extensive background info. Can not say i am not one of those people, who love a little bit more information behind the story and characters, but this movie was built perfectly in a way they could afford to skip the usual horror movie cliché nonsense and get straight to the action.People tend to say this film lacks story, but what we need to realize it does not need to have a story simply because of the setup we are given at the very start. They try to reveal a bit at the end, just to stir up the imagination, nothing too much, it is not blatant and something mysterious remains for the sequel. Overall an awesome horror film, with plenty to look out for, despite its short runtime!",REC
99,daggersineyes,This was horrible,1,16 September 2013,"I don't get it. Where are all the recommendations for this coming from?? It's like a very annoying amateur youtube video that's made by a couple of teenage buddies just for fun, with no thought to any real plot or characterisation etc. It seems the ""director"" (if you can call them that) just stuck a camera in the hand of someone (with palsy judging by how bad their camera work was), assembled a group of people in costumes and told them to run around screaming and yelling at each other for an hour or so. It was just woeful. And made worse by the fact that this time it's in a foreign language so you're supposed to actually read the dumb wooden dialog as well as listen to several people yelling unintelligibly/screaming all at the same time, while you try to also follow what on earth is supposed to be going on in the shaky, out of focus, badly framed camera footage. Poking both my eyes out with a sharp stick would be more enjoyable.I keep waiting for a ""hand held camera"" style horror movie to actually thrill, scare, horrify me or even interest me a little bit. But all I get is a headache from the usual over-acted screaming and hysterics, eye strain from trying to discern what the camera is waving around at and a vaguely nauseous feeling in my stomach. There's never any real plot to these things they all seem to be just a series of shaky shots of something that might be scary or might be just some mad old fart with bad hair in an ugly nightdress waving her arms around like a demented goose. Please let this stupid mockumentary/shaky camera ""trend"" die out soon and perhaps we might get some real directors back into the business of making horror movies. These other ""shaky cam"" dudes can go back to their day jobs which, hopefully, they have more aptitude for.",REC
100,kevin_crighton,Scariest movie in years!,10,19 April 2008,"A documentary crew are filming the fire brigade, when they are called to a building where screams have been heard in an apartment. What they find, however, is something terrifying.....Rec is a Spanish horror movie. It's done in a similar style to Diary Of The Dead and Cloverfield, with a camera recording everything as it happens, and what we are seeing is their 'footage.' HOWEVER, this movie is by far the best yet.This movie is truly scary. Unlike Cloverfield, which Rec is closer to, the scare sequences and 'set-pieces' seem more natural and convincing. It also features possibly the scariest child ever in horror movies! The cast all give excellent performances, and are quite convincing as the horror gets out of control. The direction is superb, with as I said some truly brilliant sequences.Like Cloverfield, it's never fully revealed what is causing the horror. There are suggestions as to what is going on, but I won't reveal them here. But I like the fact it never states exactly what is going on. That makes it not only scarier, but also more 'real' in the context of the movie.Rec is a movie that should be seen. It's the first time in a LONG time I was actually feeling scared in a cinema. As a horror movie fan, with very few exceptions the recent horror movies have been disappointing. Diary Of The Dead, The Orphanage, The Descent, 28 Days Later/28 Weeks Later were the last horror movies to unsettle me at times.But Rec is better than all these movies. It is scary, terrifying, and without doubt the best horror movie that will be released this year.It's already been giving an American remake. Trust me, it won't be this good.See it!",REC
101,deastman_uk,Residents Evil,6,23 April 2008,"While this film is 100% derivative, Resident Evil squeezed through the Blair Witch Project, the fact is its very good.Its horror timing is impeccable, and the writers have clearly understood a lot by watching Lost and other high quality TV productions. It even has the decency to end when it has nowhere left to go.Its not a Spanish film in any sense. A set of Barcelona apartment flats is the backdrop to what soon becomes a completely familiar proposition. The subtitles don't get in the way, not from the first time we realise what is going on.This film will probably encourage a few similar attempts at low budget thrills, which are highly unlikely to work as well. Enjoy this gem before it goes.",REC

The modern, documentary style work well, and the pace is varied enough that sometimes the adrenaline is pumping, but other times you are on the edge of your seat, waiting.",REC
104,Craig_McPherson,Phenomenally frightening,10,17 April 2008,"No horror sub-genre has had more kicks at the cinematic can of late than the zombie/contagion flick. When done well (Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later) they can produce white-knuckle squirming among the viewing audience, and no film does this better than the 2007 Spanish film REC. In fact, the movie is so good that a shot-for-shot American remake is already in the works and due for release October 2008 under the title Quarantine.Taking its name from the video camera record mode display, REC tells the story of a reporter for the Spanish TV documentary series ""While You're Sleeping"" which chronicles the experiences of various jobs that largely take place during the overnight hours. Perky reporter Angela (Manuela Velasco) and her trusty cameraman are assigned to document a night in the lives of members of a Barcelona fire station when they find themselves sent out on a routine call to rescue a woman trapped in an archaic apartment building.When they arrive and meet with police already on the scene, they subsequently discover a mysterious and highly contagious outbreak has taken hold among some of the tenants that turns them into homicidal cannibals. Adding to their predicament, while in the midst of trying to rescue the uninfected and extricate themselves from the building's claustrophobic corridors, they discover authorities have sealed the building on the grounds of public safety, preventing their escape, leaving them with no other option but to run, fight and hide for their survival.The Directorial tandem of Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza waste little time moving the story from mundane introductory documentary footage to the rapidly escalating terror of the story unfolding within the apartment building. By deploying a ""reality TV"" point of view, they also manage to draw upon the best elements of The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield  two notable films that used the hand-held-camera reality concept  but by putting the camera in the hands of a professional, avoid much of the jerky, out-of-focus, stomach-churning cinematography of the former films.Built upon a tight script by writers Balagueró and Luis Berdejo, the story also answers many of the viewer's questions about the outbreak in a manner that only adds to the movie's tension.It's been a long time since a film so thoroughly creeped me out to the extent that REC did. Insofar as the zombie/infected genre goes, this is about as frightening as it gets.",REC
105,diand_,TV vs. Film,7,26 January 2008,"Movies used to have a more or less fixed camera position, later fixed to some character or point-of-view, with the action revolving around the frame. More intelligent filmmakers (e.g. DePalma, Tarkovsky) showed us what can be possible with a non-fixed camera position and clever editing, and with them the camera eye widens and also limits what the viewer sees or perceives, often having to make up the meaning or interpretation of it all. So, where to go from there? REC uses the clever idea of moving the camera eye to the non-acting cameraman, and although the idea is not unique, it is well done here. From then on, you can do things like blurring, putting it off for some time, extreme shaking, make it stand in the way, etc., all things a horror movie actually needs to build tension or relieve it.As humans we are often strangely attracted to blood and accidents, but also want to shy away from it. This ambiguity is used here very well in what we are allowed to see and not, sometimes crossing the line a bit, then again straying too far from the action, increasing our curiosity.And the movie is well constructed, with the main focus on the difference between the boring world of television and the exciting world of film. Look for example at the start scenes with a bored reporter making uninteresting material with standardized shots or the hilarious interviews after the first strange happenings and see how TV is portrayed here, and then later all the action, shots and positions in the film parts of the movie.Some things are not new: A key is needed to enter a new part of the house thereby solving another part of the mystery (Mulholland Dr.) or the ending (C'est arrivé près de chez vous / Man Bites Dog), but it still makes REC an enjoyable experience. I hope they don't screw up the Hollywood-remake Quarantined, although the title already gives little hope, with Hollywood's fixation on ""explaining it all because we suppose our audience is stupid"".",REC
106,Lucabrasisleeps,"Terrifying Movie, one of the best",9,24 January 2009,"So after having watched a lot of disappointing movies in this genre, I have stopped watching Zombie movies. But I watched this movie without any inkling of the plot. And I wasn't disappointed. People who don't like zombie movies are also likely to like this movie. This is because this movie goes the traditional route of more emphasis on atmosphere and jump scares rather than gore or social commentary.The movie's premise is pretty good. A reporter accompanies firefighters to a building where screams of a woman are heard. The residents of the building are trapped inside because the police seal the building. One of the terrifying things about this premise is that something like this COULD happen in real life. Unlike most zombie movies where the action is spread over a whole city and the movie quickly turns into an action with the survivors on the run, this movie doesn't fall into that trap. The movie is set in a single building which is darkly lit which means there is not much place to run. Jump scares are aplenty and the first few scenes with the old lady are very well done. My favourite scene is the last scene in the room at the top. If zombie movies were done in this manner, I may have watched a lot more zombie movies.So what makes it real? It is the performances. The performances seem real. For once, it is not a bunch of beautiful men and women who are the characters. It is instead people who look like people next door. Their characters are also pretty fleshed out which is quite special in such a short movie. In the course of the movie, we get to know the characters. My only complaint is the behavior of the reporter when asked to switch off the camera. She positions herself as the person who wants to make the truth known. Her show of social consciousness seems quite hollow. The shaky cam is also quite realistic. In the sense that it doesn't seem like it is on all the time. So the filmmakers have done a good job of maintaining logic and this makes it better than most horror movies in the recent past. The last few scenes are downright scary and I found myself jumping at various instances. One problem I found was the end is not explained properly and we don't exactly understand the reason for these events. Still when the movie is this exciting, who cares about the plot? Overall, one of the best horror movies in recent years and Spain is really establishing itself as a focal point for quality horror movies.9/10",REC
107,joelgodinho,Quite possibly the scariest film ever made,8,8 May 2020,"Rec is a 2007 spanish found footage film that truelly gets under your skin. What makes this movie so scary is that (apart from maybe the end twist) it feels so incredibly realistic, the performances don't feel just good, it feels like those are actual people in an actual *quarantined in a building with zombies* scenario, I really like Pablo too because despite not even appearing on screen I personally felt like he had big presence on the movie (besides just holding the camera). I really liked the scene where they are interviewing everyone in the appartment and you get to know the characters and what they feel. I also really like the make up espeacily on the old lady from the beginning. The film is extremely tense and suspenseful until the very end because most if not all characters are really likeable or you at least understand them, like the young cop who is alaways freaked out and even points a gun at the film crew but it makes sense as he is put on the duty of commanding the people in the building but everyone is pressuring him and there is a film crew filming everything. Overall I really really liked this films despite some flaws (like the one that nearly all found footage suffer: why keep filming?? In the beginning it made sense but when everything starts falling appart and there are infected everywhere I think any person would just drop the camera) and I think it's definely one of the greatest horror films of this millenium if not of all time and I also find it really memourable.

108,TheMovieDoctorful,The Scariest Movie Of All Time,10,27 May 2015,"As I said in my ""Paranormal Activity"" review, I LOVE found footage movies. VERY few movies are capable of truly scaring me, and most of them are found footage/POV horror flicks. However, in my opinion, a handful of found footage horror movies stand above the rest as titans of terror; ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Afflicted"", ""The Marked Ones"", ""Unfriended"" and ""(REC)"". And let me tell you, ""(REC)"" is the scariest of the 5 and as a MASSIVE horror fan, it is the undisputed scariest movie of all time. I don't see any horror movie in the near future beating ""(REC)"" in the category of outright horror and terror.The acting from all the cast members is phenomenal. I have no problem believing that what I'm seeing on camera is real, that I'm watching real human beings reacting to real horror. Manuela Velasco gives a particularly realistic and authentic performance as Angela Videl. Starting the film off confident and even openly defiant, we slowly watch her character break down more and more psychologically over the course of this terrifying film. Watching such a strong character like her reduced to a childlike state of fear and panic is incredibly effective.The pacing is by far the best I have ever seen in a horror movie. Many found footage films tend to beat around the bush and not even attempt to scare the audience until the last 20-40 minutes. ""(REC)"" goes straight for the jugular and jumps into the terror 15 minutes into the movie with a horrific and genuinely unexpected scare that genuinely made me jump (It wouldn't be the last time I did so watching this film) "" (REC)"" is a film intended to scare everyone and leave no audience member unfazed; from jump scares (Which come across here as well executed and unexpected rather than gimmicky and predictable like in many a horror film) to more tension related scares to nastiness scares, to claustrophobic scares, it doesn't matter what kind of horror movie you like, ""(REC)"" WILL scare you.In fact, perhaps the most terrifying and underrated scare in the entire movie relies entirely on tension, build up and using your imagination. About 10 minutes before the ending, Angela and her cameraman hide in the attic to escape the zombies that have infected the apartment. There, they find a tape recorder that explains the origins of the events that resulted in the current horrors. This scene is as close to perfection as a horror scene can get. It's claustrophobic, shocking, allows the viewer to use their imagination and leads up to the most pulse pounding scare I have ever seen in a movie (HINT: There are noises just above Angela and her cameraman when they are in the attic)""(REC)"" is a terrifying experience. Many people claim to love scary movies, but ""(REC)"" is a movie that grabs it's audience by the balls, looks them hard in the eyes and asks ""Do you REALLY like to be scared?"" It's not ""fun"" scary like Blair Witch, it's ""Jesus Christ, I need to pause this and watch ""The Boondocks"" to calm my nerves before they explode"" scary. While much of the horror genre is pretty good these days (Obviously with exceptions) very few films are genuinely ""scary"" anymore. ""(REC)"" is an exception. It's a roller coaster ride to Hell and I mean that in the best possible way.",REC
109,thebogofeternalstench,"Unoriginal, loud, clichéd......SUCKED.",3,1 September 2009,"I'm sick of reading rave reviews of REC that praise it to be so original and scary. Nothing original about this movie. Typical zombie/infection film with so called hand held shaky camera (which had perfect/pro picture quality.) I couldn't of cared less about the annoying, loud mouthed lead actress...I was hoping she'd be horribly killed earlier in the film.The infected people were ridiculous, and laughable.I found myself laughing at most scenes.This movie is over hyped and I was very disappointed.Its guaranteed to scare wimpy teenagers but as a veteran horror film watcher this movie failed miserably to entertain me.",REC
110,McQualude,The best horror movie Americans will never see...,8,12 April 2008,"There was a horror movie that came out in Spain last year and has been touring the world called ""REC"" (IMDB won't allow the brackets). A local news crew attaches to the fire department for a ""COPS"" like feature. The fire department is called out about an old woman who has become hysterical in her apartment. The police are already on scene when the fire department arrives and together they break into the apartment only to find out that something hideous has happened. A policeman is wounded and on the way out of the building, the paramedics discover that the entrance has been sealed and the building being wrapped in plastic. Ominous figures outside warn that the building is under quarantine and anyone trying to leave the building will be met with force. The story is told by the news crew who find that the public's right to know is not absolute and a particular policeman who seems to know more than he is telling makes every attempt to stop the filming. What follows is horrible and bizarre and truly one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Despite being a low budget movie the acting is very good and the pacing is spot on. Since Blair Witch the hand held camera films have become very popular but this is the first movie since Blair Witch where the filming comes off as legitimate. I found it interesting that the cameraman, despite being a main character and primary storyteller, never appears on camera which makes the footage seem more legitimate.",REC
111,Zombified_660,Flawed but exciting horror-actioner,7,5 November 2008,"Okay, I'm going to cut through some of the hyperbole that's bouncing around REC. If you watch horror films regularly, REC will entertain you but not scare you. There isn't a single thing in this film that you won't have seen elsewhere, up until the final 15 minutes, where there's a scare that Jaume Balaguero fans will be kind of expecting but less familiar horror fans won't. I won't spoil it but even if you hate the first hour, the final act is worth watching.With that out the way, REC is a refreshing and exciting horror movie. Shot completely on proper home video (not just POV like Diary of the Dead) from the first person perspective of one character, Carlos the cameraman, it takes the format of a 'lost recording' of a 28 Days Later style viral zombie outbreak in a small Spanish apartment building. It's brutal, fast and invigorating.It's got a largely excellent cast of believable unknowns, with only a few cast members giving way to a bout of the 'for godsakes will somebody eat that woman' (primarily the supporting female cast are REALLY annoying) and excellent usage of realistic settings to generate a bizarre 'real world' feel that makes the movie pretty uneasy viewing.However. It's got to be pointed out that REC is not perfect. For a start, the inventiveness of the film extends only to the way it plays out and the way it is shot. This is a by the numbers, boring zombie outbreak movie shot from an out of the ordinary, exciting perspective, in an abnormal setting. The actual storyline can be summed up in one sentence 'regular people get trapped in a highrise with a few zombies and deal with it really badly resulting in more zombies' and never really goes any further than that.The characters act stupidly, arrogantly and selfishly throughout, and really, most of them get what they deserve. It's probably what would happen in a real life quarantine situation, you'd be bound to get a few people who wouldn't take 'stay here and be calm' for an answer and make matters worse, but it doesn't make for good cinema. There are some awful ham-fisted attempts at social commentary too via a Chinese immigrant family and an ageing racist that just add nothing to the pot. There are four likable characters in this movie, and thankfully they take up most of the camera time, but a stronger support cast that you didn't WANT to die would have gone a long way to making this frightening. We've recently seen a move in horror movies toward the sensible conclusion that the better thought out the characters are, the more of a wrench it is if you know some of them are going to snuff it, and it's a shame to get back to the 'Oh look you got eaten alive and now you're a zombie, we TOLD you that was going to happen' approach.Also, the attempts at 'scares' are things that would only scare a horror virgin or people labouring under the impression that The Ring is 'terrifying' and Hostel was 'shockingly violent'. For your buck here you get a lot of 'I've run out of flashlight battery, let me put another one in ARRRGH THERE'S A ZOMBIE CLIMBING UP MY LEGS' and 'Lady, lady are you okay, Lady...okay I'm going to go and see if she's alright...Lady AAARRRGH! SHE'S EATING MY FACE! HOW SURPRISING!'. It's cheap, it's predictable, and it's only just saved from being laughable by the original feeling of seeing it in first person. If you've played Doom, Silent Hill or FEAR, this movie will have a hard time scaring you, put it that way. In a way, that's very sad, given that director Balaguero has turned in recently the startling, creepy and original Fragile prior to this, which frankly scared me half to death. I couldn't help but feel this should've been better.Still. REC is at the base of all things, a great ghost-train movie. It isn't a well written or particularly original film, but it is good seat-of-yer-pants entertainment, and provided you can forgive it it's generic nature in the plot and script department, it's a very very fun ride. And it has a great ending.",REC
112,Lomedin,Average,5,9 June 2010,"I can't understand why this movie got such a high score. I didn't know much about it when I started to watch it, and the beginning wasn't too bad; it seemed genuine. That's until we move from the fire station. Suddenly, the firemen left with the cameraman, the young reporter and practically everybody else start to overreact and the acting goes down the toilet. It doesn't look fresh anymore. Perhaps this is something to do with me understanding their language? I do not know. What I do know is that I can't find anything really original here, from the plot to the handycam/nightvision stuff... I can see pieces of other movies put together to ""create"" this. And, to be honest, it didn't impressed me at all. In fact, by the end of the film, the lady reporter acting was basically making me angry. Watch if you don't have anything else to do or are into this type of movies. Otherwise, you are better off with another flick.",REC
113,CihanVercan,A great Zombie movie and a must-see on Halloween,8,18 September 2013,"There are only some minor spoilers in my review, and those spoilers are in the technical and structural aspects of movie-making. I'm not going to spoil the story to you, because it's very brief like a prime time news story. I just want to mention the opening segment of the sci-fi movie District-9. The style used in District-9's opening segment is inspired from Rec. This horror film has been made within a first person point of view live action perspective, and shot by a single hand-held camera. The ultimate challenge is that the entire movie goes until everybody dies. There are no bad guys, and no good guys. Everybody is a victim. Everybody must die. All along the movie we are controlling Pablo's camera, and we are in his point of view. If you ever played FPS(first person shooter) computer games, you'd like this even more, because this film is entirely in FPS gaming style. We are always in point of view of Pablo's video camera. If the battery dies, the camera shuts down, then we can't see anything. If the audio receiver is disconnected, we can't hear. If the camera lens gets broken, we'd take off the lens, and start filming via night vision. This is a very strong premise, and absolutely this is what made me keep watching till the end. Otherwise zombie movies for me are just unreal and nothing interesting or scary, and always guessable too. I'd recommend this film for adolescents who want to have fun on Halloween. As a unique zombie movie, it deserves multiple views. Turn on the volume and just join the fun.",REC
114,Endless_01,Extremely intense and terrifying to watch.,8,20 June 2019,"REC is an excellent example of the capacity of the false-documentary genre. This film is very well made, both for its genre and its format, which we have already seen over-saturated many times. However, REC stands out for its presentation and narrative powers; full of incredibly intense moments, terrifying scenes, solid and very realistic performances (for the event presented to the characters, they do an excellent job) and with an interesting story that makes us inquire about what happens.A well-filmed horror film, to such an extent that it actually becomes very hard to watch, stressful and distressing, full of super-tensed moments of fear filmed through a well-done perspective.It can be said that this among the best horror movies, for the simple fact that manages to captivate the distressing experience of the characters through the events that occur within the film; an experience quite unforgettable for those who saw it for the first time, a scary film made with quality and professionalism, highly recommended for lovers of the genre.",REC

116,IamROCKAS,"If you love good horror movies, you'll love this one.",9,7 September 2020,"After my review of Quarantine (2008), it was pointed out to me that it was actually a remake of a Spanish found-footage horror film Rec. My curiosity got the best of me and I decided to watch the original too. And I' glad I made that decision because this version is way better. I don't want this review to be a comparison between the two movies, so I'll try to touch so thoughts that I didn't include in the review of Quarantine.Rec is the kind of movie that is all about the experience, the suspense, and the atmosphere. This is also the kind of movie you wish you hadn't seen because then you'd be able to experience it again for the first time (I said I wasn't going to talk about Quarantine but I think the experience of this movie would be far better if I hadn't seen it first. There, I got that out of the way, now back to the review). It's a rather short movie but it's short enough to keep you interested throughout the entire run, everything is well packed and the pace is almost perfect. It goes from a quiet, even slightly boring documentary from a cheap local TV crew to an atmosphere that is full of tension and fighting gloom in a blink of an eye. Just when you think you've had enough of zombie movies, this claustrophobic setting brings different light into the genre.Speaking of the scares, most of them I didn't see coming. A lot of Hollywood horror movies became sort of predictable in that matter. You don't need gallons of blood and body parts flying around to make a movie that will scare the living hell out of you. The ending was good in particular. Without spoiling it too much, I'll just say it's shocking and I felt the despair along with our protagonists as they went through all that hell and ended up in the final place of action.",REC
117,alexpeychev,"A re-introduction to the term ""horror"".",7,14 January 2021,"REC is a film that utilises the POV (Point of View) camera technique for the entirety of its duration. It is a technique in which the person behind the camera is a character that is integral to the plot, narrative and story of the film. In brief, REC is a horror film that begins with the crew of a TV show, called While You Sleep, making a documentary about firemen. As the film progresses the crew are lucky enough to accompany the fireman on a call out to a local apartment building.Undoubtedly and unsurprisingly REC will be measured by the film The Blair Witch Project, especially given its plot and the manner in which the film plays out. Comparatively REC is also a horror, low budget, sticks to a female lead and has an ending that is very similar. Although The Blair Witch Project was a ground breaking film, given its illustrious marketing campaign and widespread fooling of audiences, if the two are to be judged purely on their viewing merits then REC is by far the superior - if anything REC is the film that the Blair Witch should have been.

And that's what good found footage films are suppose to do........ make you feel like you are there movies, such as Cloverfield, diary of the dead, the blare witch project, paranormal activity. Those films make you feel like you are there and you see the things and you just want to just yell at the screen and the people to run. A movie like REC deserves to be praise. This is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen. I loved this movie and it has made me paranoid ever since. Even up to this date. The ""suspension of disbelief"" works unlike some other titles I have seen. One of the best films both Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza have ever directed and I am really impressed.

121,WasiReviews,Modern Horror Masterpiece,9,24 January 2021,"REC is a masterpiece in cinema, a realistic feeling movie about a television reporter Angela Vidal (who is a real-life news reporter in Spain named Manuela Velasco or at least was a real-life news reporter). The best part about REC is how it justified keeping the record button on you know her being a news reporter and such the cameraman was pretty funny for like 3 minutes of the film which is a pretty nice chunk for a 90-minute film. Angela Vidal played her role well and it felt real. The quality of the video determines your feelings about the film I recommend viewing in at least HD depending on what device you're watching although I will say that 1080p or 4K is too high because it doesn't feel at all realistic with that much quality and 480p seems too low for a news report even in Spain, 2007. The zombies made the whole film feel intense and the close-up of their makeup is scary. This is easily the scariest found footage film and probably the best.Also, DO NOT WATCH THE ENGLISH DUB, please bare with the subtitles yes it's painful but seriously the English dub is one of the worst I have ever seen the dub is off by like 5 seconds and the voice actors don't sound anything like the people on screen Angela Vidal sounds like a 50-year-old on the dub. It's hard to find the English sub but check out Amazon Prime Video or Shudder to get the film, you could pirate but the moviemakers deserve your money because of how good this film is.Another thing to keep in mind is that despite it being technically a zombie movie it doesn't feel like a zombie movie you know that same worn-out genre that The Walking Dead, Zombieland Doubletap, Z Nation that spent way too much time in the internet's pop culture. The zombies come up close to the camera and the suspense and infections are interesting so don't hesitate to check it out if that turns you off. REC is 90 minutes anyway. I'm saying all this because I want anyone that is a fan of horror to check out this incredible foreign flick.",REC

123,bennyhagen,"Not bad, but maybe too much hype",6,12 April 2010,"Besides doing an OK job with keeping the realism, the elixir here is, that REC manages to deliver things in a rather enigmatic way, so the whole movie has some taste of mystery which gives a lot of tension. This certain mystery makes the movie somewhat more then your average Monday night horror rental. Manuela Velasco, playing the main protagonist does a decent job too and also is nice enough to look at, so you probably won't get bored watching her over 90 minutes. The supporting cast is also well assembled, they all behave natural enough to not to be obtrusive regarding the realism. The thing just is, that there is really nothing new to see here and I can name about 5-10 horror movies of the last 5 years that are superior to this certain one in about every single way possible, remember The Decent, Orphan, Splinter, Eden Lake and so on so I personally do not get the hype around REC. Sure, it was thrilling and fun, but that's about it. All in all, REC is refined enough to be good as a horror flick and has it's moments. Taking it as what it is, I'd give it a 6/10.

The 'lost footage' is sometimes edited heavily for no good reason, characters act in unrealistic ways, and most scenes are telegraphed well in advance.Of note: the SFX if dreadful, with guns sounding like cannons, I guess they had to turn the volume to 11 on everything since the entire cast spends an hour yelling at a the lapel mikes that aren't supposed to exist.Most disappointingly, at no point did I fear for the cameraman or the interviewing lady , or any of the protagonists for that matter.

129,jcooloti,This is in the 7s?!?! WHATEVER. It's terrible.,2,19 September 2021,"There's not one thing special, unique or good about this incredibly below average found footage movie. As a LOVER of horror films (Frankly, I'm obsessed...) I cannot recommend this movie AT ALL.1st I'll say this. It's a zombie flick. As soon as they got to the apartment building I was like, ""wait... it's zombies? Okay. Must be a pretty original take on it with its IMDB score at 7.5, cool. Let's see what happens."" I love TONS of zombie flicks BUT this one is incredibly ""whatever"". If you want fast and frantic zombies, check out 28 Days Later (which I find to be CLASSIC) or the Dawn of the Dead remake. Those are great zombie flicks with ""rabid"" zombies.I also enjoy a well done found footage movie. The Blair Witch Project, Blair Witch, Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity, VHS, even Hellhouse LLC and dare I say Found Footage 3D (yes, I was very entertained by that one... it's a great spoof). REC WAS THE MOST ANNOYING FOUND FOOTAGE MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. Something about that reporter... she was just JARRING.And that wrap up in the penthouse apartment... WHO CARES? Seriously. Who cares? It didn't even really make sense anyway. It's zombies. Who cares? At least the explanation for the virus in 28 days was kinda cool and funny... it also explained that those zombies are basically rabid LIVING things rather than the undead. So these zombies are ""possessed""? Gimmie a break. I'd I want to see a good movie with ""possessed"" zombies I'll watch DEMONS for the hundredth time. Now there's a GREAT zombie/possession movie.The fireman falling down the middle of the stairwell and the little girl freaking out earned this movie it's 2 stars. But those are honestly the only good parts... Mainly because they really made me laugh (but in a good way, not a ""this is stupid"" way. I genuinely liked those parts). Otherwise, be prepared for a lot of annoying screaming and Spanish being shouted directly in your face at 100 million miles an hour. There's some great Spanish horror films out there... this is not one of them.The best part about good zombie films are not the zombies, but the drama between the survivors. George Romero established that when he made Night of the Living Dead and every good zombie film or show since then has understood this. We didn't watch the Walking Dead for so long because we thought the zombies were scary (even though they often were). It was the character development and the power struggles that held our interest. Evidently, the makers of REC didn't get the MEMO.But seriously, why such praise and high reviews for this annoying and below average found footage film? What a joke. If you think this movie is so great, I dare you to literally just google ""the best horror films of all time"" or ""the best zombie films of all time"" or ""the best found footage films of all time""... ANYTHING, you will find much better films than this sub par piece of junk. This film is a gigantic WHATEVER. I've never been so disappointed... after seeing the high reviews and hearing the buzz... wow. LET DOWN CENTRAL. I usually don't destroy movies like this in my reviews but It has to be done. This is the most overrated (IMDB) film I've seen. Seriously people... do a little digging and find some better movies in the genres of found footage and zombies. This is not on par with those genres' best. AT ALL.",REC

So far everything Was going great even up the middle of the movie and the climax I was still into the movie, But after that it kinda went downhill a tad. not a roller coaster steep hill but a tiny drop to make me sigh. The movie was great don't get me wrong and Horror movies even remotely frightening as this should be done more often. But it just lacked a couple things that I just wish would o so be fixed before finishing it. 1. They should of done more cameraman character. The fact of how apathetic he was started to make me think he was quite brain dead. Along with the women 2. The stupid people scene. They guy kneeling to the kid and looking away made me shake my head. and the guy backing up into the room where the health inspector was. The constant back and forth for no reason when there is obviously a breakout going on and them not being able to be quiet really made my blood boil. 3.The scene prior to the conclusion made me have hope for the movie again. I was like, ""oh man"" there is an actual back story. But that was kind of taken out of proportion with the unnecessary ending scene that I thought could of been handled a little bit better. Like why did they try to walk around it? They trapped themselves up on the top floor why couldn't they just stay down?But enough with what I nick-picked.

If you haven't seen this or Quarantine, It revolves around a girl making a low budget documentary about this fire department in Barcelona. They get called out to an apartment where there is a disturbance. She goes with them still filming the whole thing. Her partner is actually filming it and since he's filming it, I think you only see him a few times in the whole movie. It mostly focuses on the girl. While the firemen and she are in the apartment building, it gets quarantined and none of them can leave. A few try to leave during the movie and get shot down. It's a typical, who is the real enemy, the zombies or the government. By the way, I should've said right off, it's a shaky camera zombie movie. It's really gruesome in some seems too. The ending, to try not to give anything away is kind of chilling. The acting is pretty decent. This review is really for both the Spanish and American version, since they are both almost identical. It's just a good old fashioned zombie movie, with the shaky camera gimmick, which is so popular these days, thrown in to make it more appealing, but I think the movie industry over does a good thing a lot.",REC
132,powerfull_jedi,What do you get when you rip off both Blair With Project and 28 Days Later?,5,26 April 2008,"The answer: A very clichéd zombie movie with headache inducing camera work.Remember Brian Griffin's reaction to Blair Witch Project? It was something like this: Nothing's happening... Nothing's happening... Something about a witch... Nothing's happening... Movie's over, a bunch of people in the audience look angry.It was little more then what I felt about this particular motion picture. Let me give you an idea of what's going on, a news reporter(who apparently does a TV show for late night that nobody watches) and her trusty camera man tag along with some firemen who received a distress call from an old lady who is apparently locked in her own apartment. Police and firemen arrive only to for the woman to suddenly bite a police officer, then one thing leads to another as army guys quarantine the building and things start getting out of control.First off, is the movie really scary as some claim it is? Depends. on the screening I attended there were two types of audience members, the 15 to 17-year old and the over 24... I noticed completely different reactions. The younger crowd was so scared they had to leave the room a couple of times to relax. The other half, in which I was inserted, kept whispering sarcastic remarks and complaining about the camera angle and of course, disappointment was obvious in their looks, when it ended.That's doesn't mean that REC is without any merits, the environment is quite tense but sadly it's the only honorable achievement this movie ever gets right.Other then that, prepare yourself for a few dead moments where the characters are just talking and talking and talking. In the building watch some guy badmouth his Asian neighbors while not aware that the camera is on. Watch the main character interview dozens of uninteresting folks and it justs goes on and on. The first part of the actual motion picture seems to take forever, it meant to give us some emotional attachment to our main lead. But as the movie progresses, she becomes easily the most annoying character here.Yes, she does... Mos-Def-in-16-Blocks annoying. She feels the need to scream at the top of her lungs and confront some character with stuff like ""What the heck is this!?"" over and over even though the character is explanation her everything with perfect sense and the items she gathers are all in perfect order.The only character I felt sorry for was the tough-as-nails firefighter who ends up having to fight off monsters with nothing more then a hammer. Everybody else is unappealing.The camera work here takes cues from TBP, of course, the shaky cam. I've been somewhat supportive of this method because it tends to make everything feel a lot more tense, especially in fight scenes. This isn't a martial arts movie, so at times it feels more nauseating then actually scary, tense or both for that matter.And this is the first documented motion picture to have PDS aka Portuguese derangement syndrome, you'll know it when you see it. I didn't watch Cloverfield and somehow I'm grateful for doing so, as I feel that these real-time documentary scary movies aren't really that good. Want to get really scared out of our wits? Play the Condemned games on Xbox 360 and PS3, they seem scarier then the vast majority of horror movies lately.",REC
133,pmdawn,Excellent Horror,9,4 April 2008,"This little-known Spanish movie is a solid horror, in the first-person tradition of ""Blair Witch"" and ""Cloverfield"". It also borrows elements from a series of other movies, but it is so well-done that you can easily overlook that and enjoy the movie for what it is.I won't say much about the plot, only that it starts with a News Reporter that is covering a story about one night in the life of the local firemen, and goes along with them when there's an emergency call. From then on, it's surprise after surprise, and a LOT of tension. This is not for the faint-hearted or those who get camera-sickness. There's gore, there's suspense, there's great acting and a nice ending. I couldn't ask for more. This is survival horror at its best.I really don't understand why it's being remade as ""Quarantine"" (other than the dollars), because it is a perfect little film on its own, and a great addition to a new kind of more creative horror.

There really isn't a lot of time wasted on subplots or melodrama.

frustrating since it fails to give proper closure or just a little bit more information.I have to commend the editing process of how well the film turned out.

That's how .Rec is, an authentic adrenaline shot that will leave you wanting for more even after you have finished it. Directors Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza know their business very well, and they demonstrate it with this terrifying pseudo-documentary turned into survival horror. There are roots from the Resident Evil franchise, especially when the movie reaches its final part, lights go out and you can only see what's on the spotlight of the camera. What begins like a regular night for a TV channel crew turns into a nightmare, when they are taken into a building following a firemen squad and the Sanitary Authorities seal the building because it's filled with an infection that turns dead people into zombies. So if you want to describe it somehow in a mathematic formula, this is The Blair Witch Project plus Zombies and into a closed building instead of an open environment. There's no suggestion here but full explicitly as you see blood spurting from open wounds and jaws crunching onto bones. .Rec is certainly the best horror movie of 2007, incredibly original and genuinely terrifying. Even if you consider yourself the toughest human being on the surface of the Earth, you will find yourself screaming like a little girl at its most tense and so indelible moments.",REC
139,Supachewy,One of the Best Horrors of the 2000s,8,18 September 2010,"The horror film Rec is directed by Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza and stars Manuela Velasco and Ferran Terraza. The film takes place in a modern day apartment building in Barcelona.The film starts off with a news reporter, Angela (Velasco), at the fire department with her cameraman Pablo. The two of them work for a program called While You're Asleep and are discovering what the night shift of a fireman is like. The department receives a call that there is an elderly woman who needs help. So the camera crew follows two firemen, Mani (Terraza) and his partner Alex. They arrive at the scene and all of the residents are making a big commotion and there are two police officers also at the scene. The police officers and firemen approach the elderly woman's apartment and enter. They see her there covered in blood just standing there looking oblivious. Until she attacks them...The screenplay for this film was quite good. It is definitely one of the best horror films of the 2000s so far. I thought the characterization was quite good, I felt I knew Angela, Pablo, and Mani pretty well and I could definitely understand the terror they felt in the situation they were in. The scares were excellent because it was all about waiting and the suspense. Another great thing about this film is the scares actually come from the film, what I mean by that is there is no score that makes you scared. Definitely one of the best of the hand held horror subgenre.The direction for this film by Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza was quite goods as well. They got really great performances from there actors all around. Not one of the actors I thought were too over the top since they did need to be somewhat over the top for this film. I liked also how they did not try and put in any sort of nice shots into this film like some of the other hand held horrors try to do. It was just straight up filming and it was great for what it needed to be. The two of them did an excellent job at building up suspense such as when the police and firemen first contact the older woman. Many other horror directors should note this film on how to do suspense properly.The acting in this film I thought was excellent. Velasco was great as the news reporter, I could never even tell she was acting. She was so believable in how she always wanted to get everything on film no matter how terrified she was of the situation that she was in. Terraza was as well very good as the fireman Manu. Even though the situation got tough he was still a leader and tried to do his best to help. Again I could not even tell that he was acting, maybe because I was so drawn in to the film and that it was in Spanish, but still I thought the two acted extremely well. The rest of the cast gave fine performances as well, like I said in the above paragraph no one was ridiculous in how they acted.Overall I give this film an 8/10. It is one of the best horror films of the past decade and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of horror. If you don't like subtitles you can watch the American remake Quarantine which is basically the same film.",REC

Upon answering a distress call at an apartment complex things quickly escalate from a disturbance to an illness and then to forced quarantine within the building. With residents getting concerned and frightened the camera crew and our female lead are forced to go further into the building with any hope of escaping.I will say this is the best found footage movie ever made. Being in the current pandemic situation does not hold a candle to how terrifying this could be. This movie was totally gripping and all the characters were believable. The scary scenes are scary and claustrophobic. The violence is on par with a horror and not over the top which I liked but some instances were unforeseeable which work in tandem with the scares. The camera work was not all shake and steady when it mattered which is a huge plus. I also enjoyed the fact that people were not idiots in this movie as this amped up the terror factor as even the most competent person could die. But the thing that does it the most is that whatever is happening is virtually unknown. The characters are kept in the dark about the whole lockdown situation and are left to fend for themselves against something they could no way comprehend or be prepared for.If you want horror than watch this, you won't regret it.",REC
141,Onderhond,First person horror,9,17 October 2008,"I've been covering quite a few French horror flicks lately, but France is not the only European country delivering quality horror. Spain has been doing the same for a little while longer, and though Spanish films are usually somewhat cleaner and more relax, from time to time they shine just as bright as their French counterparts. Enter REC.The current hype around REC has much to do with the way it was filmed. REC is another one of those films following the formula of Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. But along with the hype came a legion of naysayers, arguing the film lacked originality because of this. Well, I have news for those people. It's still a lot more original than 99% of the horror classics are and were.The directors made only one mistake. REC follows the principle of the ""found tape"", which contradicts at many points with the actual footage. It's pretty obvious that many shots were not made by a dedicated camera man running for his life. Apart from that, the hectic on-site footage works wonders. It's considered a simple trick by many, to me it's simply a new visual means of expression, that has already earned its place next to regular filming methods. Let us hope that once this ""trick"" has settled in, the films will be valued at their actual merits.The intro of the film is pretty short, from there on REC places you right in the middle of the action. The camera swoops in all directions, so whenever it gets tense you experience similar emotions to the people on screen. You gaze at the screen to get glimpses of the action, and when the camera remains still for a few seconds, you are just as disoriented and looking for possible danger as the characters. Exactly what makes this technique so valuable for the horror genre. It adds a whole new dimension which was completely lacking in years and decades before.The soundtrack is another marvel of manipulation. Even though the directors didn't use any actual music, they tweaked the soundtrack to such an extent that it still holds a lot of tension. Lifted samples, muffled squeaks and low hums make sure the audience is never at ease, even when these sounds can hardly be contributed to the surroundings. Smart work. Add to that the constant screaming of the characters (talk about Spanish fury!) and you have a film that attacks both visual and auditive senses as much as it can.For the bigger part of the film, the audience is left clueless of what is going on, which only adds to the tension. Only near the end, things are explained in short (and without too much detail). And even though I'm not a big fan of these kind of explanations in horror films (they often waste valuable horror time), it does leave the film with some nail biting scenes where the heroes are uncovering the truth amidst a house full of mass hysteria.Finally, the scares in REC are also extremely well-executed. Even though they are easy to predict, they remain ultimately effective. Only in the middle part of the film does the tension ease a bit, but from there on it's one wild ride to the finale which is worth every penny of a visit to the theater.REC is a lovely thrill that smartly uses modern techniques to its best advantage, creating a truly creepy and tense atmosphere where so many films have failed before. To top that, it's also one great adrenaline rush, made up of chaotic visuals and a screaming soundtrack. One of the best films I've seen in theaters for quite a while, and definitely one of the best horror films ever. 4.5*/5.0*",REC

It was so inexplicably unfortunate that they decided to remake this movie frame-by- frame.

Whole movie is shot as documentary type (fans of Cannibal Holocaust and Blair Witch know what I'm talking about) but this, even compared to those two, feels more realistic and I swear, If I cough it on TV without knowing, I would think I've been watching documentary about whole incident. Thinking of that, it still shivers my spine, I just can't believe what I've just watched. Know that I'm a big horror buff and I've seen hundreds of horror movies. While most of the horror movies nowadays rely on graphic gore, this one spins in totally new direction.

You may think ""What the hell will happen in remaining 50 minutes?"" Trust me, till those 15-20 minutes of the movie, it looks like regular documentary, but from there on, movie becomes twisted, sick and bone chilling. Since it's done in that documentary style, you can easily find connection with the characters and feel what they feel, see what they see. This means, there are no stupid cliché characters (bimbo, as$holes, smart guys, nerds, strange caretakers, Chuck Norris, pranksters and other things) nor campy dialogs. Every character is done in so natural way, that I feel like producers\director got total freelance to those actors to improvise dialogs, with only restriction being fallowing the main plot. I don't know how they've done it, but acting has to be strongest part of this movie.There are also some strange and I mean VERY STRANGE things happening at the end of the movie, so be sure for a shocker.

147,maatmouse-1,Spanish 28 days later done on Blair Witch Project Videocam,8,27 August 2008,"A friend of mine recommended this, stating it scared him so much he was quite ill, which is the point of any good horror/scary film.The premise is very simple and ticks all the boxes. A young Spanish reporter with her video-cam man is doing a piece for a local TV station entitled 'While You are sleeping' which looks into the work of the Spanish fire brigade on their 'graveyard' (early evening to early morning shift). Very little happens at first, then the fire brigade get a call out to a block of apartments where a woman has been heard screaming by neighbours. The reporter and video-cam operator follow them on what appears to be a very routine call out. Unfortunately, it isn't.What transpires next is a terrifying trip into how a simple premise can build into an effective and frightening horror movie with the addition of quality ingredients. This one ticks all the familiar boxes: strange and old apartment building, unknown residents, sick children and dogs, quarantine procedures which apparently make no sense (and happen very quickly) and finally, panic which turns into chaos and horrible fear. The film makers of this one obviously realised that there were certain things which worked. Add in video-cam style shooting similar to Cloverfield and the earlier Blair Witch Project and interrupted lighting and finally, a disease which MIGHT be an attempt by one resident at possession and you have a chilling, jumpy experience which is a step up from more familiar origins. Very simple, yet so effective.",REC
148,cablooie,As empty as Blair Witch 10 years later...,3,13 September 2012,"After watching Rec I have been sitting here in disarray trying to recall who had positively reviewed this awful bunch of aerobics geeks yelling in the camera for no reason whatsoever. A 5 min. short (2 scenes are well shot with a good dramatic and horror effect, probably the only true script: a short. All the rest is just random dough) stretched into 75 minutes with the only intent of reaching theatre length and widening its scam environment. After some 15-20 introductory minutes most of the actors (one day a therapy of some kind will prove I am right, they are actors) start running up and down the stairs, probably in the attempt of setting a new record.Then they take turns having nervous breakdowns.Obviously when something different from aerobics on the stairs and nonsensical screaming begins actually happening the cameraman is regularly hit by Delirium Tremens and starts shooting close-ups of the actresses nose or shaking the camera giving the impression of a barman trying to put together a mojito. Of course it's not a mistake, the idea is to conceal the low rated special effects (basically the bad guys have face powder and black eyeliner, the good guys don't).Ingredients: 9% stereotyped found-tape 2nd hand scenes just to rise timecode; 20% Blair Witch Project (senseless screaming, running and even spinning around in dark rooms with potential homicides heavily tarted up nearby); 1% good scenic ideas (guess where they put the only sensible one...); 0% script. Stir + shake. End. Honestly I can't assign the spare 70%, it's simply non existent. This ""film"" is 30% of itself and I can guarantee I am being generous.I suggest any other activity, including trying to flip a coin using your toes, much more entertaining.",REC
149,bearfaceproductions,I compared (Quarantine & REC),9,28 June 2009,"OK, First I saw Quarantine which didn't give me any scares, I wanted to see something pop up and scare me but no. On the other hand REC was a movie that scared me even if watched it on a small screen. It was heart pounded and I happened to scream. Here the acting was better than Quarantine, of course the one who played Angela Vidal in Quarantine was an awesome actor, but in this one everyone (including the girl) acted so good that the film was scary and convincing. This movie is a real horror-fest with plenty of scares, suspense and thrills. Those fans of the horror genre will not be disappointed with this movie. Quarantine had a few different things than REC but it didn't manage to be scarier or better. I say Quarantine is a cheap copy, and hopefully with the announcement of REC 2 (which I hope will be better and more frightening) they wont make Quarantine 2.",REC

151,luke-346,"A re-introduction to the term ""horror"".",10,10 April 2008,"REC is a film that utilises the POV (Point of View) camera technique for the entirety of its duration. It is a technique in which the person behind the camera is a character that is integral to the plot, narrative and story of the film. In brief, REC is a horror film that begins with the crew of a TV show, called While You Sleep, making a documentary about firemen. As the film progresses the crew are lucky enough to accompany the fireman on a call out to a local apartment building.Undoubtedly and unsurprisingly REC will be measured by the film The Blair Witch Project, especially given its plot and the manner in which the film plays out. Comparatively REC is also a horror, low budget, sticks to a female lead and has an ending that is very similar. Although The Blair Witch Project was a ground breaking film, given its illustrious marketing campaign and widespread fooling of audiences, if the two are to be judged purely on their viewing merits then REC is by far the superior  if anything REC is the film that the Blair Witch should have been. It is the film that I wanted to see when I queued up in the rain, 10 years ago full of hype, anticipation and adolescent excitement.Despite REC being a better film than The Blair Witch Project some critics have attacked it for employing such a tired technique that has been used too much in recent films (i.e. Cloverfield and the forth coming Diary of The Dead). The method that has been employed in REC is, I believe, a method that is now firmly embedded in the medley of cinematic processes that a film-maker may chose to exert. It seems strange to me that once a new technique is discovered or employed and put to use regularly, people and critics complain  especially when it works. Granted, if we are subjected to a recent flurry of films all using similar methods then yes, it deserves further scrutiny and what usually surfaces is that greedy studios are exploiting market trends.The film is co-directed by Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza and they have clearly dipped into the bucket of clichés with REC, but in doing so they have created something that is both fresh and reinvigorating. It should be noted that clichés aren't always a bad thing and when put to good use can give the audience exactly what they came to see. It's true that the plot is minimal and there are loose ends, but then the vast majority of horror films often suffer from these traits, and sometimes purposefully, but with REC it doesn't make the film any less enjoyable. It is also evident from the plot and the methods employed that the film is very low budget, but this does not do it any harm, instead it complements the narrative and increases the films appeal.I believe the true quality of the film lies in its ability to cleverly use the history of the genre and the bare minimal of resources to its maximum potential and, unlike Cloverfield, there's little room to doubt the reasons for the cameraman to continue filming and this is (like Blair Witch) due to the fact it's his job. He is there to film a documentary and in true cameraman style his instincts take over. The acting on show here is also a lot better than Cloverfield and the people all look normal, some are even unattractive.To put it bluntly REC contains some of the most fear inducing and scariest scenes of recent times. It achieves a level of fear that's rarely experienced in cinema and if watching the film carefully it can be seen how. REC has been made by people that are incredibly familiar with the horror genre and fans will recognise the homage's and the inspirations used, from Evil Dead, to The Shining, to 28 Days later and many more. With such a wealth of horror-viewing-experience combined with inspired film-making they are able to draw upon some of the best moments in horror history.Towards the final reels the film plays like an amalgamation of ideas and inspirations. One of which is the influence of contemporary video gaming as some scenes allude to how certain computer games work (most notably first person shooters) and this is supported by the POV technique as we, the viewer, live the character of the cameraman much in the same way a gamer lives the character he/she is in control of. This notion is furthered by the different levels in the apartment building, the films use of rooms, the final scenes and several allegories to various computer games including Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark and Silent Hill.For a feature film it is incredibly short at only 75 minutes, in fact it is closer to the length of a TV documentary which is perhaps its aim. I cannot recommend this film enough and have even tried to construct my review in a way as to not give too much away; as it is a film that needs to seen. Watch it with the lights off, with a friend and in a small room. Enjoy.",REC

153,dsa_ca,So tense that this movie left me in wreck,10,12 October 2008,"It has been done before, but not to such crackling effect. It started with 'The Blair Witch Project', to create mock horror documentary style movies, but that movie till the end remained in 1st gear. But definitely an innovative movie for starters, which could have been much more if the makers would have removed there self imposed restrain on the film. Then this year we had 'Cloverfield', which was a new & mock documentary version of last decade's Godzilla and was loaded with hand held camera jerks. Meanwhile, last year Spain continued it's (what I call) Horror revolution to challenge Japan's horror tradition (Seriously Hollywood is no where near in sight of these two). Spain produced last year Rec a.k.a Recording, in which the director paces the movie by using all four gears into such good effect that the movie's atmosphere crackles the audience at the end with nerve wrecking anticipation.Rec is a Spanish horror movie that was released in 2007. For a reality program called while you were sleeping or something of that kind, a very sweet and confident reporter visits a fire brigade station in Barcelona to document there night shift at the fire station and for the sake of reality sensation hoping that they could receive an emergency rescue call. Seriously they should have preyed for nothing of that sort. But as the night starts to drain out a bit with no action taking place around the station, you would too wish for some alarm to ring somewhere, which after sometime rings. That starts the show and the reporter excitedly hops on with the rescue team along with her cameraman who would be recording the whole scene. As they reach the spot of rescue, a run down local apartment building, they get to know that the neighbors had made the distress call to fire fighters and police after they heard a loud noise from an apartment where a certain old Columbian woman is trapped. So with the cameraman, the reporter goes to the apartment floor along with a police officer and fire rescue team. As they break into the apartment, they find a certain eerie silence along the apartment hallway and as they enter the main hall of the apartment they find the old women standing and shivered in a shocked state. But as soon as everyone calms down, the woman suddenly attacks an officer and bytes a chunk of his neck. This causes a lot of chaos and the rescue rushes back downstairs to get the injured treated quickly. But as they reach the exit of the gate they realize that the city authority has closed all exits from the building and has began to quarantine the building. And follows here after will catch you breathless. So tense the situation become at the final reels of the film that it will leave you in wreck. The residents along with rescue team and reporter who insist on taping the whole chaos are left alone trapped inside building with a woman with a certain mental decease which seams contagious. Tension prevails among the residents and as the reporter stumbles upon the revelation that would explain the case a shiver will be sent down your spine. The next few reels the fear of the unknown would grip you.All this transpires in just 75 minutes, but even such short running time seems lengthy during the tense final reels. The final 30 minutes leaves the audience in wreck. The crackling effect of the tension is captured so well by the director that the shudder of the final 30 minutes is something I have never experienced before. The story may sound just another gimmicky zombie horror, but one must not underestimate it. The director and the actors give us enough thrills to forget all other zombie films. After The devil's backbone of 2001 and last years The Orphanage, Rec is another chilling gift from Spain for horror fans. One should surely not miss it if they want a chilling taste of horror rather than watching its spin off 'Quarantine' from Hollywood releasing in 2008.",REC
154,vosnescis,1/10,1,17 July 2017,"Awful.My head was filled with many questions throughout the movie. How do I describe it? Let's say we all are suddenly convinced Jimmy is a zombie, and Jimmy has been an okay guy for the last while. And as we stare at Jimmy, all of a sudden comes this instant conversion. Okay, it can happen. But it seems a little deliberately placed, and such actions like this throughout the movie really break the immersion. Oh, and if Jimmy ran off screaming into a place, and you became aware that there were more infectious monsters than just Jimmy, would you go after him with a needle? Does that seem reasonable? And if Alfred is dumb enough to stand next to a zombie inside its cage, that's possible too; maybe someone is that dumb. Yes, ""that's possible"", ""sure, i guess, if ..."" -- great movie when you're fiddling with plausibility the whole time.How I remember the movie: A pointless beginning (follows any news reporter movie: watch a reporter hyped about something for a large chunk of time, get that ""persona"" rubbed on you before they descend into peril), an almost constant screaming follows, speckled throughout with immersion-breaking moments of questionable plausibility, and you have a thorough waste of time and a childish invention.And I didn't realize that a creature, let's call it an angry dog (for example), would want to drag me off into another room instead of just bite me to death. That was just another immersion-breaking moment, seeing something I'm accustomed to believing is a barbaric nature, decide it wants to drag me away. I guess the director called out to it and said, ""No, that isn't a way to finish the movie: Doesn't look so profound! Re-do!""",REC
155,guillermobosque,"REC is scary as hell, well-acted and dreadful.",9,20 January 2016,"Summary: REC is scary as hell, well-acted and dreadful. 90/100 (A-)Spanish is my first language and I just loved to watch such a good film in my language. It is hard to find a film like this one. REC is consistently frightening and well-executed. Each character is well-developed, and you care about all of them. Its running time is very short, but in those 80 minutes there are so much stuff to watch and you will be completely satisfied. The movie starts quickly, straight to the point. The best thing about REC was its final act, seriously the last ten minutes are mind-blowing. This movie is unique and surprising. It is a must watch, even if you are not a horror fan. It is one of the best found-footage films I have seen.Everything looks so real, you feel a connection with the characters and its ending is just brutal. I watched REC at night with the lights turned on, but that did not help to decrease the horror. It delivers suspense, disturbing images and some bloody scenes. The performances were excellent: Manuela Velasco and Pablo Rosso were quite believable. The supporting cast was terrific too. Each character had something to contribute, and all of them were interesting. They all looked like average people, and this brought me an awesome sense of realism. It is extremely hard to make a masterful found-footage horror film these days, but REC nailed it. It is an instant horror classic. (A-)",REC
156,benegesserit20,Not bad at all- A comparison with Quarantine,7,28 August 2012,"This review contains spoiler, please don't read it before watching the movie. The same goes for its remake Quarantine, as my comments here will be mostly a comparison of these films as I can't handle them independently.The reason I watched this movie was a very unpleasant experience with its remake Quarantine (well, it's quite an understatement). I gave Quarantine 1/10 just because 0 is not an option. Compared to this original one Qauarantine seems even worse (it's hard to believe, but true)which is even more shameful regarding the fact that it's following very closely the storyline of Rec, even the locations look completely identical. How can happen than that two things looking exactly the same can be still so different? Well, as they say, the devil is in the details. Rec beats its remake in small things only, really, but these small things improve the overall impression significantly.Let's see a few examples of these small things: Firstly, people look like ordinary people. The reporter girl is pretty, but not that intimidating beauty than the other girl in Quarantine. In exchange, the Rec girl isn't screaming for an hour, however she is slightly annoying, but nothing unbearable. Secondly, after the first wave of shock, the remaining policeman and fireman are able to act like professionals and the people living in the house are calming down as well. Believable. No brainless, never-ending hysteria like in Quarantine. The reports made with them are really funny, to me it was really something some people would do while being interviewed and it was good for easing the tension a bit. And last but definitely not least, the story covering the whole infection thing is much better described in Rec and the last scene in the attic is very enjoyable.The weakest point of Rec is the basic story itself (a sick dog, a house found by the dog's chip, but how the dog caught the virus and how come that the old lady was the first to turn crazy, that's a bit confusing), if we insisted on studying the plot holes deeply, the whole thing could be destroyed, like when a pretty house collapses because its base wasn't designed properly. Fortunately, we don't insist (fine, I don't insist)on digging deeply into plot holes unless they are coming right into our faces.In conclusion, Rec is not bad. So, if you are into found footage stuff, definitely give this one a try. As for Quarantine, I wouldn't touch that DVD again even with a pitchfork.",REC
157,jzathajenious,A somewhat over-hyped horror flick,7,13 August 2013,"Bought the bluray of REC after reading so many glowing reviews. I must say i was underwhelmed when all was said and done.at about 75 minutes, REC doesn't over stay its welcome, however its only the final quarter of the movie that really delivers the scares (fairly meagre scares at that).The movie is filled with many plot holes. the main one being: there are a group of tenants who inhabit a building and one by one they all get infected with a mysterious disease and die/get killed off. a few of these tenants who appear prominently earlier in the film are simply forgotten by the end of the film as if they never existed. this is lazy writing. And the explanation for this chaos is frankly dumb. a priest researching a girl with a disease finds its highly contagious, so instead of killing her or at least telling the authorities, just locks her in the attic and hopes everything will work out somehow. right...and the condition itself is inconsistent, example: the cop/fireman who are infected take about 30 minutes to become psycho, whereas the little girl Jennifer appears to have been infected for days before she turns. once again lazy writing. and its never explained how the first older lady gets infected or even Max the dog. lazy writing annoys me greatly. its obvious the film makers were more concerned with those big ""fright"" moments than a cohesive story.Too much shaky cam (a cheap way of creating tension and chaos i.e. excitement) is utilised, which is a pet peeve of mine, however i understand from a narrative POV this is necessary. It does tend to stretch believability though that Pablo (the cameraman who is never seen on camera) is much more concerned with capturing all this on camera than helping others or worrying about his own wellbeing. the characters all act crazy as well, there isn't one level headed person in the group, which basically means everyone just shouts and screams at each other.For all the many faults of the film, it does deliver scares pretty effectively, especially with the climactic Silence of the Lambs homage. All in all, its a very decent horror film, albeit a very unoriginal one with some gaping plot holes and inconsistencies. i picked it up on bluray for a tenner, so I'm not regretting the purchase, but a 7/10 is the best i could rate it. Not a classic but very good.",REC

159,HorrorFreak1997,even better found footage than the Blair witch project.,9,3 April 2014,REC is truly a intense experience. the way found footage is utilized in this film is outstanding. the found footage aspect is utilized throughout in very stressful situations to make them that much more stressful. plus the setting (a apartment complex) is so claustrophobic and dreadful that you can't help but squirm because of the intense situations that the characters are in. i really believe the found footage aspect is what makes this film what it is.. a masterpiece! the cast give great performances all around and don't become annoying or react to situations unrealistically. to top everything off the contagion/zombie threat is horrifying to say the least. did i mention this film is intense.. the intensity factor is a huge influence on my thoughts of this movie. there really are not many films out there that can get your blood pumping quite the way REC can. i have not seen zombies this scary since 28 days/weeks later! there is no score which in my eyes adds to the realism and intensity of the movie. the plot is pretty thin so there isn't very much you can say in terms of story or character development but to me that doesn't bog the film down. the pacing is non stop and also adds to the intensity. really the movie works so well because it's so straight forward. it knew what it was going for and did exactly that to perfection. id recommend this to any horror fan. a really great film and hey the remake isn't all that bad either.the verdict: 9/10 a modern masterpiece of found footage horror,REC

I am actually repenting for reading some of the reviews before hand since it could scared my wits of if I had not known the plot. The talent of Jaume is clearly expressed in the simple story of a documentary of Rescue Operation gone seriously wrong. The characters, the plot, the shocks, the first point view , the deaths all add up nicely for this movie. The main protagonist in the movie is actually a normal person like us who sees all the things which go out in a apartment block. The witty dark humor, racist under tones, the insecurities of the people living in a apartment block, political satire all are a part of the society we are living and portraying the same as a back ground one hell of a movie is a real achievement by the makers of this classic. I have seen Cloverfield and it left me with motion sickness, but this one clearly far superior and more engaging will definitely give you the scares when u think about darkness. The hysterical madness we are put through for more than 1 hour is worth it and is a definite winner. I was hoping this will be not remade into another Hollywood trash but I am too late. Hopefully Jaume involvement in that project will add the require class needed to make the remade movie successful. My rating is 10/10 simply for trying something different and still giving the scares.",REC
161,BloedEnMelk,Nothing so special,6,6 April 2011,"Before watching it, I had read quite some things about 'Rec'. How it was supposed to stand above many POV hand-held found footage movies. How scary it was supposed to be. Many people call it the scariest horror movie they have recently seen. Was I watching something else last night, or have I simply seen too many good horror movies to be impressed by a movie like 'Rec'? The story is not a complex one. A local TV team is making a documentary about the fire brigade. There is a call from a building, not for a fire but because screams were heard. When they get there, they enter the building together with a police officer, and find an old woman who is covered in blood. She attacks the officer and from there on everything goes down hill. As soon as they want to leave the building, an unpleasant surprise awaits them. Outside, the building is getting sealed by the government and nobody is allowed to leave. * Spoilers coming* There are many things you can see coming from miles ahead. The illness of the little girl, the contagiousness of the 'virus', it's all no surprise. I found it also pretty annoying that the camera was shaking so much almost the whole time. I mean, if you are a cameraman, you must have at least a bit of a steady hand.. sometimes even when nothing was really happening, the camera swayed too much from one side to the other. Having made some typical amateurish holiday movies like everyone does, one of the first things you learn when watching your own footage back is to hold that thing steady, and not to use it as an extension of your eye. Thankfully, there was some black humor used in 'Rec', and it might have been more than I noticed, as I have the feeling that the subtitles I had were of a bad quality. I can't make a fuzz about that, as this comes to the translators and not to the makers of the movie. So maybe I did miss some important dialog quality. The ending.. well... it wasn't bad, but not that original either. The girl was spooky, more then the old woman was or other people in the movie were. So that was a good thing. And again, what happened to the film crew was no surprise. * End of Spoilers* I have still given this movie a 6, because I think that my not-too-positive opinion is also to blame to the fact that I do watch a lot of movies, and many of them are scary. If you are not used to watching so many horror movies, then it really is an entertaining film, which probably gives many people a good enjoyable scare. But if you are like me, a bit more thick skinned and with a lot of movies in the back of your head, then don't be surprised if you find 'Rec' disappointing. I'm sorry, I just can not make that much more of it. That's not just because I simply would have liked to see more scares, but mainly to the fact that I would have liked to have seen a better worked-out and more intriguing plot.",REC
162,yoncenator,Some good parts but on the whole.. (very minute spoiler),5,12 August 2009,"I watched this movie with a clean slate. I had absolutely no idea what it was about except that a film crew follows a fire crew for one night.As the realization of 'zombie movie' hit (fairly early) I was already let down. I was expecting something a little more believable. It still held my interest with not being shy with blood nor death, but the meat of this movie is really just a 'BOO' movie with shaky cam that quite frankly was getting on my nerves in a headache way not a horror tension way. There's constant yelling and chaos that is never logical, running upstairs then back downstairs then back upstairs then back downstairs then back upstairs that never really has a reason other than that there really is not a lot of plot here. The only saving grace is that it's only about an hour and ten minutes not including credits. So by the time you've had enough and really want it to be over (or shortly after that point), the (weak) climax kicks in and credits roll.There are a few really great parts to this film but not enough to ever make me want to see it again or suggest it to another horror film fan. I can only imagine how poor the sequel is. I doubt it has any MORE charm than this film does. The zombies were just like all the rest, except for 28Days'/28Weeks' zombies or Zach's Dawn of the Dead zombies (more my type) I just didn't really feel or care for any of these victims at all. They don't try very hard to survive and even after seeing a dead person come to life, they don't ever think of dismembering the body of other zombies. Come on, this is 2009. Zombie dismemberment is common knowledge! Even in Spain! Just slightly more annoying than likable, I gave this film a 5.",REC

The premise was simple but the whole execution was explosive! It has been a long time since I wanted to shut my screen just to save myself from all the stress haha.

164,Margera4445,Scariest Film Ever Made,9,28 October 2008,"When Cloverfeild came out, I expected it to be the defining moment in the POV genre. Then, a friend turned me onto this film, Rec.The movie follows a night with reporter Angela Vidal and her cameraman Pablo as they follow a small group of firefighters to an apartment building in Barcelona as part of a television program called ""While you're Asleep"". As soon as they get to the building, they bash their way into a small apartment room owned by an elderly woman. The woman stands disheveled in the moonlight as firemen and a couple of police officers approach carefully. Blood drapes her nightgown and her face as she breaths heavily. Pablo and Angela follow nervously behind the crew. As Pablo turns on his camera light for a better look, the woman becomes increasingly disturbed eventually breaking out into a fit of hysteria and biting the officer in the neck. They manage to subdue and flee from the woman with the officer in tow. As they treat his wounds, they learn that not only is there a crazed woman in the building, but special forces and health teams have cordoned off the area, repeating over a loudspeaker that this is just for safety precautions. The crew, Angela Pablo, and the residents of the apartment building soon realize that there is no way out of the situation and they must face their fears to survive whatever and whomever is in the building with them.Concept - 9/10 - While the movie has its intense scares, original storyline and average acting, the concept of the movie is not a ""never-before-seen"" deal. The ending credits to the movie seem to draw away from the intense realistic feel of the movie overall. But the filming and acting are almost top notch.Acting - 9/10 - Yes, Cloverfeild did NOT outrank this movie on the acting scale, but at some points, there was a bit too much drama to some parts. Otherwise, the acting in all of the characters were top notch and believable.Atmosphere - 10/10 - The screams of infected humans echoes through the long winding staircase of this small building, the dark recesses of the rooms and halls of the building are draped in the sounds of radio chirps cause by the special forces team outside of the building, and the feeling of claustrophobia is extremely present as the knowledge of no possible exit or rescue overcomes all of the characters. The infected humans aren't there for cheap scares, when you see one, you have no idea what they'll do until they do it.OVERALL - 9/10 - The atmospheric quality and thrilling nature of this Spanish film make it the most terrifying adventure into the ""infection"" genre that I've ever witnessed.

165,gsic_batou,Best use of documentary style horror movie ever,9,7 October 2010,"Rec is a direct descendant of ""Blair Witch Project"", but with a more solid setting, plot and script it manages to work beyond its stylistic gimmick and offer a truly eerie film experience.Made on a small budget, it never feels cheap, containing great acting as well as being technically perfect(some may complain about the lightning, but I feel it is a stylistic choice that works well).Ultimately, a lot of the scares are old tricks, but they are included in such a seamless and logical way, that they never feel out of place. The thing I liked most is exactly how it begins in a fun mood and manages to not only get more and more claustrophobic, but how the plot seem to gain speed as it approaches the inevitable conclusion, making you as confused and out of breath as the character themselves.Highly recommended.",REC
166,ozymandiaskingofkings,One of the greatest horror films ever made,10,1 July 2009,"Every so often a film comes along that I buy on impulse, having heard very little about, and it really takes you by surprise. The Spanish horror film REC*, is one such movie. I was vaguely aware of it having been remade in the US to fairly negative reviews, but bought it just on the strength of IMDb recommendation (i'm a horror board regular).In some ways, the trick REC has up its sleeve, mimicking documentary footage, is nothing new, dating back to ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and more recently being used in films such as the ""Blair Witch"" and ""Cloverfield"". It is however, far more successful than either of these. ""Blair Witch"" I won't go into, its boring, pointless, pretentious twaddle thats about as scary as ""Winnie the Pooh"". ""Cloverfield"" I actually loved, but it is mainly sci-fi rather than horror and it fails for two main reasons: firstly, it is too polished, no home video even at the best of times is as clear, coherent, or relevant as what we are presented with.Also, while offering little explanation, way too much was shown of the monster and as the protagonists ran from tower block to subway, to army base, to shops etc, I couldn't help but feel way too much ground was being covered. In order for something such as that to be gripping, it has to be claustrophobic and paranoid- just look at Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" for a great example on how it should be done: one man, with a narrow mission (get to Boston) experiencing bewildering chaos. REC understands that confusion, paranoia and claustrophobia are the key ingredients of any successful horror and the taut plot and verite style reflect this.The film follows a local TV reporter making a documentary following a group of firemen over a single day. The opening 15-20 Min's effectively set up the film as a straight documentary, complete with bloopers, intros, retakes etc. Its effective, we get to care about the characters quickly without the need for a lot of exposition as allows the film to get straight on with the story. The firemen get a call from the police to an apartment building, details are sketchy, but an old woman was heard screaming and they can't break into her flat. Once the fire crew break in, it is clear that something is wrong with the woman as she attacks one of the cops. The firemen decide to evacuate the building, when it emerges that it has been quarantined for unknown reasons. Then all hell breaks loose.Those who have seen either Romero's classic trilogy or Danny Boyle's excellent ""28 Days Later"" will pick up pretty soon on what the nature of the 'infection' is, but the way in which the story is told, as much a Lord of the Flies character piece as a traditional zombie horror, is great.Stylistically, it is so well done anything that seems clichéd is irrelevant, as we see a narrow and claustrophobic view of the horror, compounded with genuine shocks, subtle implied nasties, and balls out adrenaline fuelled carnage, as the likable reporter tries to first document the confusion of what is happening, then explain it, before finally attempting escape. It also feels very convincing, the use of none actors adding to a convincing verite feel.The film also knows the meaning of narrative economy, proceeding like a juggernaut to its horrific conclusion as genuine terror and impeccable suspense marry to create a very intense and nail-biting film, that, like Romero, isn't afraid to follow the story to its logical conclusion.Rec is probably the best horror film since ""The Descent"" and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",REC
167,schism101,Intense and terrifying horror!!,9,2 April 2008,"Viewed at Manchester Cornerhouse Viva film festival. REC is one of the most terrifying and thrilling horror films to come out of recent years, that displays some clever inventiveness along with the traditional 'boo' scares expected of the horror genre. Filmed from the point of view of a local Madrid TV crew who are profiling fire fighters as part of a fly on the wall documentary series. Though the night consists at the beginning of nothing much happening at all, things take an unexpected turn when the crew follow a call out to an apartment where they find a crazed old women who attacks and bites a policemen present, infecting him and turning him into a crazed zombie. Its not long before there chance of finding outside help is stopped as the authority's isolate all the apartment block inhabitants and essentially quarantine them, leading the inhabitants and the TV crew to fight against and avoid the ever increasing zombie infection. REC achieves its scares and intensity through the use of close up point of view camera, that has most notably been used in two American films this year CLOVERFIELD and GEORGE ROMERO'S DIARY OF THE DEAD, and also the night vision sequence in THE DESCENT, where the scare comes from, the camera panning to one side and revealing something you don't want to see. This use of p.o.v makes the film more intense and personal, and interestingly enough, the director who was present at the screening, explained in a Q &A after the film that he didn't tell or inform the cast of what was going to happen in the scenes thereby increasing the realism of there horrified reactions. It's this brilliant style and memorable shocks that lend REC as one of the most clever and inventive horror films of recent memory. Go see it at the cinema, as this is the only way that will make you appreciate the intensity of the film, though be prepared to be exhausted, of ever a film had the mantle of shakiest camera in the world, this is it, and also see it before the Hollywood remake QUARANTINE is released later this year.",REC

She was smiling in scenes where she should have been tense.

169,moselekm,Proof that true Thrillers are created beyond the US Borders,8,20 January 2010,"I have disliked Horror and Scary films for a long time, probably around my very beginnings of my teenage years. I believe it is because the 'slasher' films made up the going fad for the past several decades of American Film. It wasn't until years later where I discovered Zombie films where I began to just justify my horror collection as ZOMBIE only. However after even more years, I was introduced to foreign films. And better yet, foreign horror flicks.Non-Japanese-Horror to be specific. And this proves the Latin-community truly knows how to creep out it's viewers and still come out with a PLOT in the end. I know. A plot + horror? That's not proper English edict, but this film does it well.The movie takes on the Amero-unpopular camcorder perspective and does it right. (That's right, pot shots on Cloverfield). The acting is prime as well. I remember watching the first ten minutes and commenting on how real the people were. Perhaps the unfamiliar faces helped, but all the same, you can trick your more gullible friends into believing this is a true-story. Seriously. It wouldn't be difficult.Is the film a Zombie film? Many people have vaguely put it as one. And as a unofficiando of Zombie films, I will say it can rightfully have the title as a zombie flick.If none of this answered your questions. Just remember. This film delivers on a 98% on the realism scale as far as personalities, reactions, and gore. Giving just enough for creativeness such as ""Jumping in just in time to gore a man's throat open"". If you want to see a good horror film that actually comes out with a plot, or just a good film that will give you the creeps that will last a few tens of minutes (or more?), get this film and show it to your friends.And on a final note. Yes, duh, this film is better than Quarantine. However, both are worth checking out, and watching Quarantine afterward will make you appreciate Rec even more.",REC

First of all plot was OK for a zombie-virus-movie. That was somewhat OK, although a bit predictable. For instance i knew immediately that dog and the little girl are probably responsible for the strange virus...In general OK story that could pass as solid zombie ""wanna be"" movie. But there is one problem with this movie-first of all lead character-she starts screaming 10 minutes after beginning of the movie and never ends, that i found totally annoying and honestly wanted her bit by those zombies. Second thing i didn't like is camera work-so OK it was supposed to be a real footage, nice idea-but i t was to shaky and 80% of the movie i couldn't see what's going on,only hearing that lead girl screaming and screaming. Some parts of the movie are totally blurred and honestly i would appreciate more, when at some point the cameraman had put down his cam, especially when 20 zombies are attacking him. It is pretty unbelievable that he would continue shooting,when his life is in danger.And then there is end they come to an attic where they find some strange articles about possessed girl-that didn't make any sense at all and honestly by that point the movie was filled already with clichés and i was tired of camera work so that i didn't care less how the movie was going to end.

172,FFAxDAVID,Excellent Film,8,2 April 2008,"As previously commented, this is a hand held camera ala Blair witch type film made in a convincingly realistic style and gives the impression is real life rather than actors in a film.Without spoiling too much,it is a classic Zombie film in an up-to date setting that although gory in parts aims more for the realism of its characters than on the more usual Hollywood special effects and settings that most try to emulate (but fail miserably at usually,especially when have a budget anywhere near the one obviously used in this film).Do not get me wrong,low budget or not its excellently acted by its participants, not one seemed fake or out of place in their environment,and the script did not at any time seem contrived or out of place for the circumstances. The viewer can easily identify both with the characters and their re-actions to whats going on around them.I have nothing bad to say of this film considering the restraints of the budget which may have been improved by better lighting etc, and i highly recommend any scare fans to watch this,as although there are only a few set pieces those that are in it are ideally filmed and timed,bit like when the head came out of the sunken boat in jaws-you know its going to happen if seen it before (or just listen to the music heh),but even so it still makes you jump due to its perfect timing-and the set pieces in this film have the same effect. (And there are plenty of gore effects between the big scares to keep you interested too)All in all a well made and terrifying film set in a situation that,if happened to you,you could easily see your own potential reactions portrayed by one or more of the characters-which just makes it all the more realistic and scary.",REC
173,rumbleinthejungle,Really wanted to be excited about it......,5,20 March 2009,"But in the end it was just OK for me. There is some really good stuff in here and there was one particular shot near the end (Pablo looking over the railing of the stairwell from the top of it and seeing all the Zombies) that blew me away, but maybe I just had too high an expectation for this? I don't know. I do like the first person POV but I think that maybe I wanted the Zombies to be a bit more terrifying. They moved pretty good but some close up stuff looked a bit too undemonic... or something. Good sound effects, and there's a definite feel of three acts here - the beginning up until the cop gets bitten and then it goes a bit quiet in the middle before a doctor from outside of the building comes along and all of sudden all hell really does break loose. The girl, Angela, played by Manuela Velasco is very good. You begin to get more terrified as she does so she's like a kind of emotional barometer for the entire film. The idea of a faceless character, Pablo, is intriguing as the most you ever see of him is his shoes but, unlike Angela, he keeps his cool at the end as things start to go pear-shaped. Even in Cloverfield, a film that this has often been compared too, we got to see the cameraman Hud 3 or 4 times over the course of the film. I'll probably watch it again though.

There were probably one too many hysterical moments from the lead actress Velasco. The tenants maybe were screaming at each other more than one would like. And the ending, while terrifying, generated more questions than answers for me. But, overall, it was fairly scary. This was a Spanish movie, but with English voiceovers, which turned out not to be really noticeable. Sort of gritty, kind of realistic, as far as a horror movie goes. That is not to say that there are not plot holes, because there are. But, bottom line, it had some pretty good scary stuff going on.",REC

We have seen other efforts experimenting with these kind of concept. Probably one of the most famous ones (although certainly not the first) was The Blair Witch Project which I enjoyed. The most recent one was Cloverfield which was basically the same concept with a relatively huge budget.Rec is a better movie than Cloverfield, even if Cloverfield had all the budget in the world it lacked the talent behind the camera to make it a truly remarkable and unforgettable experience.

183,theeintolerablekidd,Maybe the best Spanish zombie film ever?,7,12 June 2009,"I heard about ""Rec"" through all the fuss over the remake, ""Quarantine"", and the debates and justifiable anger of many people against the remaking of films just for the sake of the language; for people who are either too lazy or illiterate to read subtitles. I'm glad I saw this. It wasn't an amazing film and neither was it an awful one, but it was good entertaining cinema and very much the kind that I like. It's obviously in huge debt to films like Cloverfield and the earlier Blair Witch Project (not relevant here but terrible in my opinion) but it really doesn't matter because this is a good film all on it's own. The progression of the film from laughable El Dorado fly-on-the-wall style docu-drama to full-on seat-jumping horror was fantastic. At times shakiness of the hand-held camera style made it hard to work out what was going on, one scene that comes to mind is when the Chinese family were killed, but this was obviously deliberate and only added to the shocks that were to come. It was also pretty funny as well, especially when it played on racist stereotypes, ie: one neighbours disgust at the Chinese family who are ""always eating feng shui"" and raw fish. Sadly, there were in my opinion some big faults with this film and it's always easier to point out the bad than the good. The illogical reasoning behind the building being quarantined, the hacking together of the storyline behind the infections origins in the last 20mins (which was lame and could've been left out) and the incredible annoying lead from Manuela Velasco, but in the end these things didn't matter that much and Velasco's character was killed (Yes!). It ended perfectly, any other way and I would have felt cheated. We don't want her to survive or get rescued, and she doesn't. If you can look past the faults in this film, and like I had to, try not to use your brain too much, you are in for a very enjoyable ride. Parts of it were wonderful, particularly the use of - or absence of - sound, and some very creepy and well put together shots of the zombies. An excellent effort and worthy addition to the Zombie genre with some original and genuinely scary moments. I won't bother watching the remake, I've seen the original. Thanks",REC
184,sandiglendinning,Brown trousers time!,10,20 August 2013,"If the object of a great horror film is to scare, then you can't really do much better than this. Exhibit A, here ladies and gentlemen we have REC. A rather 'lovely' little found footage film from Spain set in an apartment building where a lot of things are about to go horribly wrong. A perky little news anchor-girl and her gang are tasked with following some firemen around for a while, before very long things become very splatty, bloody and unpleasant. The pace of Rec. is breakneck and things rapidly degenerate from 'yuck' to 'I think my eyes have been raped' to 'MOTHER OF GOD WTF IS THAT!!!' Before you have a chance to fully digest one horrible event another arrives to traumatise you a bit more. The cumulative effect of this relentless onslaught of unspeakable nastiness plays with your brain chemistry and the resulting thrills are unashamedly fun!Rec. is the kind of movie that doesn't rely on cheap tactics like jump scares and spooky music to reel you in, oh no that simply will not do and would be far too vulgar and dull. What it effectively does is open up your head and has a dump in it. This is achieved using an indescribable mixture of mystery, panic, creepiness, disgust and visceral gore.Known as a modern classic and and respected by every hardcore horror fan REC. is simply the creme de la creme that the found footage sub- genre has to offer, as well as enjoyed by us buffs simply for its sheer visual unpleasantness. Warning, I advise you to approach this film with caution if you are a mainstream kind of normalite film viewer. Watching Rec. with other people may result in you making a total tool of yourself being scared. Of course if you do watch it by yourself you may face an increased risk of an involuntary bowel movement but at least there will be nobody else around to ridicule you for it. Enjoy!",REC
185,DelBongo,Rec,4,5 November 2008,"Although it is somewhat smarter and more skillfully made than most of what currently passes for horror cinema in Hollywood, Rec is still just more of the same tired old moves. Its premise is shrewd and its duration admirably brief, but there is nothing here that you haven't seen before.The opening few minutes feature a young reporter looking at the rather uneventful lives of some fireman living part-time inside an urban Spanish fire station, and between interviews she is quick to express her utter boredom to her cameraman; a perception that the audience is clearly supposed to share. The bitter irony is that these sequences are so well paced, so rigidly researched and authentic, that they are ten times more interesting than everything that happens afterwards, when the camera begins to shake ceaselessly and people begin to scream rather a lot. The plot has a nice John Carpenter-ish conspiracy bent about it that sadly turns out to go nowhere, and the virus, clearly inspired by the one created by Danny Boyle and Alex Garland in 28 Days Later, is clumsy. That relentless, animalistic implacability is replaced here by a quaint, vacant semi-consciousness. These infected folk often pause for dramatic effect in darkened hallways, and in one hilarious (unintentional?) instance, turn to pose for the camera just before chomping into someone's neck.If all this relentless nihilism and verite violence is new to you, you may well find enough here to enjoy.

With a predictable US English language shot-for-shot remake already wrapped up, maybe it is time to believe the hype and watch this before said remake rakes in at the box office. Like Les Diaboliques, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, like Ringu, REC plays with tension rarely seen in the horror genre. A simple setting, simple narrative, allowing the full horror to unfold. Best seen with no idea of what is to unfold, REC may well be one of the great horrors ever made. Certainly for a ten minute period mid way through, the viewer is left stranded with the protagonists on screen, just hoping to come out of the other end intact. As with all the best horror REC uses minimum gore, sparse dialogue, great visuals. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project are unfair, as this is superior horror, utilising the slower scenes perfectly by bringing depth and compassion to the characters.

187,peter-j-downey,Found footage done right.,8,8 February 2015,"Angela Vidal (Manuela Valasco), a local journalist, starts her night in a humdrum fire station in Barcelona; interviewing awkward firemen, and capturing the banal aspects of their night. Roll on their first call; a set of apartments, cops are already there, the neighbours have heard a scream from an elderly recluse's apartment, and they need door broken down. They bash down the door and she is looming there, covered in blood, they try to comfort and she jumps on top of them, biting one of their throat's out. Chaos descends, Angela insists that she must continued getting everything on camera, and the emergency services try to get the residence out of the apartments alive.REC is another found footage film from the ever swelling pile of cheaply produced horror films, however, this one is done right. Firstly, all characters interact physically with the camera, meaning that the camera is pushed down by people who don't want to be filmed, it breaks at times, and often the sound becomes muffled or broken. Also since this camera is constantly in the live sequence of events, the action doesn't always happen centre screen, and sometimes an event can be shown by the reaction of the actors, or a description by the actors, which adds an authentic element to the found footage.Next, the script gives the characters proper motivation to keep on holding on to the camera. I have found myself in previous films of this genre screaming at the screen; ""Just drop the camera and run!"" In REC they need it for the light or the night vision or just to keep their job. Another clever aspect to the film is that the characters act clumsily around the camera, the interviews of the residents of the apartment where they forget the camera is there or they don't know that the camera is shooting was a nice touch.But the pitfalls of this film are typical of a horror film; wooden acting and an open-ended conclusion to allow for possible sequels. Valasco was the only competent performance, and even at that it was the typical downtrodden, but ambitious journalist role. The supporting cast was just underwhelming with B-movie reactions to perilous situations; for example one of the cast got part of her face bitten and she reacted initially but after acted like nothing happened. Also when the characters became zombies their direction seemed confused; some would act lively and erratic and others would be stiff and single minded. After this the conclusion felt hollow; a supernatural element was introduced with about 10 minutes left and it all seemed geared towards making further films.Despite a handful of let downs, this film genuinely frightened me nearly throughout. Also the film was possibly aware of some it limitations and managed to keep the action condensed; edited down to 75 minutes, the fast pace means anything that broke me from the reality of the film could be quickly glossed over by my mind.",REC
188,superkt,"Kind of predictable, kind of thriling",6,3 July 2020,"This movie was exactly what I thought it'd be but it did all of that pretty well.
As soon as someone gets bitten AND the people quarantined off, you know what to expect of such a movie. It's going to be something zombie-esque, people will be bitten, people will react and try to escape, and things will get a bit gory. Predictable.
The only real suspense comes from how the movie is shot. The first-person perspective means you can only see what the camera man sees and in the dark, it isn't much. Were it filmed any other way, the movie would've been rather dull. There are a handful of jump scares throughout but each and every one happens exactly where you think it will. Not a single one got me and I love a good jump scare.
The acting is pretty good though I find the reporter rather annoying but I suppose that is her job.
I did enjoy the practical effects employed throughout. The woman(?) at the end was pretty creepy and it was really suspenseful being in the dark with such a creature. Those last 15 minutes or so were the best part of the movie and that none of the characters made it out alive. No happy endings needed here.

The film provides atmosphere, convincing acting, thrills, chills, surprises, and shocks. The last 10 minutes or so were the most intense moments I'd seen in years. The story may not be entirely original, but it doesn't have to be. The horror genre and it's sub-genres have been built on clichés. However, Rec does twist some of the conventions and blends the zombie genre with the demonic possession genre flawlessly, making it somewhat of a twist at the end of the film. I highly recommend this to people with an open mind, who don't mind subtitles. For those of you who'd prefer the Americanized version, find Quarantine, although I do warn that it takes the movie's final twist, the voice recording that plays, and distorts it to the point where they ruin that part of the story.10/10 stars.",REC
190,bradman1118,this is exactly what a found footage movie should be!,8,8 December 2014,"REC is a found footage horror movie about a TV reporter who becomes trapped in a quarantined apartment building where an infection begins to spread and the residents begin transforming into zombies. I believe the found-footage sub-genre has a great amount of potential. This is shown through great films such as the Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield. However, recent found-footage movies have proved that the genre has run it's course. REC on the other hand, looks and feels like a found footage movie should. It puts you in the moment and makes you feel as if you were in the situation the characters were in. This is supported by great dialogue and acting which gives it a very realistic tone. The movie does a good job slowly building tension, and best of all, the payoff actually pays off in a nerve-wrecking and frighteningly suspenseful and intense climax. There is also a pervasive sense of dread. While viewing I found myself thinking ""What would I do in that situation?"" and that is EXACTLY what a horror movie should do. George Romero, the creator of the zombie genre, stated in reference to the Dawn of the Dead remake, ""I am not terrified of things running at me, it was like Space Invaders. There was nothing going on underneath."" Although I thoroughly enjoyed the Dawn of the Dead remake, I agree with Romero that a zombie movie or any horror movie for that matter should not just be mindless gore and people dying; there needs to be substance and ""things going on underneath"". This is certainly the case in REC, and while the film does not follow Romero's rule or have anything in similarity to the ""zombie"" classified by George Romero, the elements of drama and suspense payed homage to a Romero movie, but with the newly introduced element in which the characters are at the start of the infection and are closed off by the authorities, rather than the clichéd situation where a group of people must survive a zombie apocalypse. This idea is explored and the filmmakers dug deep into the realism and terror of the situation to make the film as scary as possible. The only flaw I can think of is the flaw that is present in all found-footage movies; the plot hole in which you question ""Why or how would anybody spend their time filming in a situation where their life is in danger?!"" I found it unrealistic that the characters continued to film even while being chased by zombies! However, that aside, REC is still a realistic, suspenseful, and terrifying horror film. For all the filmmakers out there looking to make a good found-footage movie, watch REC and take notes!",REC
191,andyhise,Astonishing. The real deal - but warn your puppy.,10,13 August 2008,"Yes, astonishing.The movie equivalent of being beaten to a pulp by ten drunken shouting Glaswegians after a night out on the Tennants. REC plants its foot on your jugular and you quickly realise it's just not going to let you off. Mercifully, death follows swiftly - you're terrified, but not for long (it's only as long as one and a half episodes of ER).We sat there last night, special edition DVD, lights off, DTS sound, big screen, snacks... IE: optimum conditions. We gave REC our best attention, and we were thoroughly rocked, especially my wife - 26, feisty, usually quite cynical (names and shames plot holes mercilessly) - who hid behind her hands and, basically, lost it. When it finished, neither of us could remember breathing recently.Oh it's brilliant, do it properly, suspend your normal disbelief, and go with it.

192,petersaarloos,"Impressive, compact, flawed",7,14 November 2021,"REC seems to me a big of a rough gem. It is a very complete film and no longer than it needs to be, which is impressive for its budget. I'm always inclined to give films that do basically the same as a Hollywood film (with budgets in the X00 M) with a fraction of the budget the credit they deserve. No A list actors, no CGI, just vision, passion and enthusiasm. Bravo.The flaws in my view are threefold.The first is in my view the biggest, and the viewer is confronted with it rather quickly, namely that everyone is constantly shouting. Perhaps it is a cultural thing--Spanish tend to be more passionate and expressive than my own, Northern European people--but it still seemed excessive.Looking at how the film is made makes me suspect it's a methodological issue. A lot of the script was improvised, which forces the actors to not overthink their lines and respond to things that are happening immediately around them based on the basic beliefs and personalities of their characters. The result? A lot of emotional acting and a lot of repetition of what constitute the characters.The combination is quite obnoxious. A woman who keeps shouting that her husband is outside, to the point that even one of the characters says 'We know!', but perhaps, worse, the main character (Manuela Velasco) repeatedly shouting to keep filming and make sure they get everything. I understand the situation is stressful, but this is just too much to watch at times.The second problem is that, during the middle act, the suspense is not very effective. Perhaps I am a bit desensitized to the subject matter, but there were only a few scenes shocking or disturbing enough; most things hinged on the comical (especially with the exaggerated panic).The suspense ramps way up in the final act, but this runs us into the third problem: the final act seems to have nothing to do with the middle act. Sidestepping spoilers, it is comparable to pivoting from a vampire into an alien flick. I liked this final section much more, and it saved the film for me from being rather boring, but reflecting on the work as a whole it makes me wonder what they were thinking with the script (insofar as they had one).Altogether, I liked this film fine. Yes, it is flawed, but it wasn't afraid to fail in novel ways. I'd much rather see this than another Hollywood flick that flops in all too predictable ways.",REC
193,teresaband,I was a wreck after watching this (ho ho),9,24 February 2008,"There's a lot of these shaky-cam movies around at the moment, and among your ""Cloverfield""s and ""Diary Of The Dead""s this low budget Spanish movie may seem like the underdog, but it's punching way above its weight.Filmed by a TV crew stumbling upon something very nasty happening in an apartment block, the movie is shot and acted brilliantly, the sense of unease gradually giving way to all out terror. While it's obviously derivative of movies like ""The Last Broadcast"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" it manages to deliver in a way that those movies couldn't thanks to some brilliant set-pieces. It's not even out in the UK yet and Hollywood have already remade it (the inevitably inferior ""Quarantine"") but do yourself a favor and spend an evening in the dark with the original. You'll regret it, but in the best possible way. Terrific.",REC
194,Condom-full-of-Hatred,Spanish flick makes zombies scary again,9,3 December 2010,"At the rate foreign horror films are being remade at the moment, I wouldn't be surprised if things ended up like they did during the production of Tod brownings 1931 version of Dracula; when his crew went home at the end of each days shooting, another film crew came on set and shot the film again, only this time using the same script but just Spanish actors, and the film was released in a different version in Spain. As it stands, Rec has yet to be granted a release in the states due to the shot for shot remake coming out this month. Blah, what's next? Burning the original film and claiming the remake to be the original?? Anyways, after that pointless hissy fit, onto the film. We kick off in a Spanish fire station at night, with a camera operator filming the antics and interviews of a fiesty little presenter as she wanders around aimlessly, hoping for some action to happen. Eventually she gets her wish, with a call to an apartment building about an old lady trapped in her room. The fire crew enter and find the police here already, and when they break into the apartment, things don't seem right. Like the fact that the old lady is acting like a squirrel with it's dick in a mouse trap and being soaked head to toe in blood. When the old lady attacks and mangles a cop, they know something is really wrong, and now the authorities have locked down the building and refuse to let anyone out. Is the old bag carrying some kind of infection that causes the victim to act like a rabid animal and eat people? Who is responsible? Who will survive? And what the hell is going on up in the penthouse? Watch it and find out yo! Shot in the faux documentary style of recent films Cloverfield and Diary of the Dead, Rec is a straight up, balls out scare film. We never leave the point of view of the camera man, as he records every aspect of how quickly things start turning to crap in the apartment block. It doesn't take long before victims start getting chewed up and attacking. The pacing is probably the film's greatest strength, running at just around 75 minutes, we never have a chance to get bored, and it makes the action and scares all the more intense. Sure, we don't get much characterisation, but for once, I felt I didn't need it. To be thrown amongst the chaos was enough for this fool. Things do get fairly intense, especially for all you guys out there with surround sound. My cleaning lady will not be impressed with the hard brown stains in my underpants this week.I won't go on much more about this one, every website is pimping it at the moment. I will say this though.

I have to admit that I'm more into psycho-thrillers or horror movies with no much gore. I have to confess that I didn't like ""The Blair witch project"" in its time or any previous films from Jaume Balagueró (""The nameless"" could be saved) so when I heard about REC and how it was shot I didn't care to much about it but after a couple of weeks and with all these positive reviews it had I decided to give it a shot. Well... I shouldn't. I recognised that probably is more me than the movie itself but I didn't like it. I wasn't frightened at all, not once. There was a point that I wanted everyone dead to safe me to watch the rest of the movie. I actually laughed watching the movie.The format isn't new. The Blair Witch project was the pioneer. The plot is lame although in most of gore-horror movies is. I was laughing in all sequences I should be scared... why is that?? It has cheap scary moments plus main characters are also naive and stupids in the way of ""let's do this when everybody would do the opposite and run away"".Now Quarantine, the American re-make is on theatres.

This isn't a run of the mill, auto generated zombie flick. I became interested in watching this when someone told me that one of the directors dropped a corpse in the middle of a scene without telling any of the actors in order to get their real reactions. It's this out of the box thinking that makes Rec work. I've watched this with a number of different groups of people and it leaves just about everyone in various states of shock and terror.Rec is an intelligent movie that keeps you guessing. The viewer is just as in the unknown as the characters on screen, which helps build an incredible amount of tension. This is one of those rare movies that leaves you on an adrenaline rush when it's over. It's an experience you wish you could have over and over again. It's a shame that the other Rec films never lived up to this first installment. Maybe they got lucky, but either way this is some intense cinema that I absolutely recommend to anyone.",REC

Sure, it's not a very accomplished film but that's meant in the same way that many Chinese films were not even borderline accomplished only 5 or so years ago, and we all know that yesterdays rubbish is next weeks classic. I'm not saying this movie is a future classic and I'm not excusing the films obvious failings and I don't have enough life left in me to reel off a list of the films it copies, both stylistically and actually, suffice to say: Watch the film, if you like it, cool.

We join Angela and her camera man Pablo as they film a fire crew going about their daily business. Events take a turn for the worse when the crew are called out to an apartment block and discover this is no ordinary emergency...I'm not going to say anymore than that, as watching REC is a real experience and one better had without knowing too much or very little.I'm a huge horror fan, I don't scare very easily. Kairo (2001) is the only film that has truly frightened me. I also thought I was pretty much past the ""jump out of your seat"" moments that make you feel foolish afterwards. I thought only those unfamiliar to horror films were the victims. While watching REC, I jumped no less than five times. My heart was racing and yes, I WAS scared. THIS is what horror is all about.REC doesn't skimp on the acting or content, either. I thought the whole cast were superb, completely believable. And the use of POV camera is probably the best executed I've seen.

The scares are unique and unexpected, the acting is great.With a plethora of found footage films in recent days, I think this one takes the cake. Yes, The Blair Witch was the beginning, but REC is the freaking PEAK of the found footage genre. Zombies are not scary for me, never have been.But REC takes this formula and makes it horryfying. The narrow apartments and staircases and the dangers lurking in every corner of the apartment complex is like nothing you have ever seen.The sense of dread and helplessness is there from the entering of the building, till the spine chilling final scene.The final scene is one of the scariest scenes I have ever seen, and I have seen a LOT! The nightvision camera is perfectly used. The main chick is lovely too. I don't think i have seen every horror movie, in fact maybe I didn't see a lot of scary horror movies, that i didn't heard of.

203,movieswithmitch,Spains contribution to horror,7,12 November 2010,"Zombie films are nothing new, neither are POV horror flicks but you don't have to break new ground if you can execute it well. Directors Juame Balaguero and Paco Plaza do exactly that in Spain's very effective cinematic embodiment of unsettling fear. The film takes a while to get going but as you come the bone chilling third act in this short 78-minute film, the splendid nerve-wrecking scares will have you feeling the claustrophobia and fear just as the movie's trapped characters do. The Hollywood court-ordered American version ""Quarantine"" came out shortly after but stick with the original if you want to do it right.Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) is a perky TV reporter who, along with her trusted side-kick cameraman Pablo, follows the events of a Barcelona firehouse for the night. When a call comes in to the fireman from an elderly woman screaming in her apartment complex, Angela and Pablo tag along. When they arrive, with no explanation, the old bat takes a bite out of a policeman on the scene, shortly thereafter the building is locked down in a quarantine. The bites, of course, make you undead but what makes this film a cut above the rest is the claustrophobic conditions told in real time via Pablo's handy-work and Angela's diligence to get to the story despite her fear. What's even better is that you never feel any hope of rescue as people realize the gravity of their situation and that there's nothing to be done about it. There might not be much in character development but watching these people trapped in this sealed off building discovering more and more bad news proved ""Rec"" to be a wonderful trick and a petrifying treat.",REC

206,jaffacake2k,A great Spanish Horror - See it if you can!,10,23 April 2008,Hollywood is making an 'English' version of this film called Quarantine. Obviously American audiences cant get their heads around subtitles. Its a shame really as this means that many Americans miss out on good cinema. Hollywood doesn't not do 'original' anymore - they merely develop whats been previously successful at home or 'borrow' the innovative films and techniques from abroad. It almost goes without saying that the US audience ends up getting an inferior film.So - should you get a chance to watch this before you watch Quarantine DO SO! Like The Blair Witch Project and the more recent Cloverfield the audience follows the story though the lens of a hand held camera. For my money it was very convincing too. Much more so than Cloverfield (Which I enjoyed). Younger and US-centric audiences will make an obvious comparison to Cloverfield. They will also be many references to 28 Days Later. But Rec shouldn't really be compared to either. Its a film in its own right and in my opinion a damn fine one. I don't watch a lot of Spanish films but if they are all of this high standard then I may very well look out for more. I cant imagine that the Spanish film industry is very large which makes the quality of the performances stand out even more. The actors carry the dialogue very well and convey the subtle humour of the script without making it farcical.But does it scare you? Well its scared a couple of bricks out of me!!! Sometimes the scariest moments were the situations the protagonists were in. I'd mentally put myself in the same situation and my stomach would turn! All in all this is a great film.

It's hard to comment on this movie without spoiling it, but i'll try. It's very difficult, after 40 years of terror movies, to make something new or special anymore. Balagueró manages to master the false documentary style to create a really scary atmosphere and the movie beats all resistance to destroy the suspension of disbelieve. The jumps in your seat are guaranteed, and the adrenaline flow is sure, so good a medicine for us lovers of terror cinema. In the process, the film has certain social issues, a message against racism, a portrayal of more than 10 characters, and the sweet drops of necessary humor. We saw a interview in the Spanish TV last week, and the directors explained that most of the ""actors"" didn't know what was gonna happen to them and the camera never stopped recording whatever were their reactions to horrible surprises. Only one actor knows what to do, where to go, and he is the one leading the action from one place to the other of the house. The effect is a rushed and hysteric spontaneity, pure madness... WOW! Try to watch it in a good theatre, with a good sound quality and a good screen. I hope our fellow Americans will be able to watch this before watching the Hollywood replica (Quarantined).

The tension of the story is built around people acting like people in an incomprehensible (to the characters) situation. A group of tenants and a few civil servants are trapped in a building by the Spanish Health Department without an explanation. Cue the zombies. Everyone runs around demanding answers from one another, who are all equally clueless as to what's happening, until a Health Department official tells them that a contagious virus having been found in a dog belonging to a resident of the building has been discovered. From there, everything happens almost all at once.The entire movie builds up to the last five minutes in a room where a reclusive scientist lived. Everything is, more or less, wrapped up here and is the only tension filled scene in the movie. Anyone who has the seen the beginning of The Grudge (American version) will see what's coming when the door to attic swings open and the cameraman decides to see what's up there, but that doesn't stop it from being genuinely scary.Altogether, this movie has a solid story line, but suffers from too much camera movement in parts that are intended to be terrifying. Easily a good movie, but not worthy of more than one viewing.As a final note, I have to say that the best part is when the little girl becomes infected and starts yelling like a brat who wants something at Toys R' Us.

The reporter and her cameraman were also trapped inside of the zip lock bag. While looking for an escape they attempt to shoot as much footage as possible without getting ripped to pieces. Determined to tell their story the camera never goes off even when common sense says: ""drop the camera and run!"" This is the set up for the rest of the film, which is relentless with gritty realism, human agony, nail biting suspense, and most importantly terror. Each scare is perfectly timed. The film uses the time in between jump scares as distraction to keep you off guard for the next scare. Unlike most American horror films you see, the film earns the scares and never telegraphs them in advance.Rec hails from Spain which is why it takes you places an American film would never go. The two directors Paco Plaza and Jaume Balagueró knew exactly how they were going to make this film and they never strayed from their vision. Every shot is seen from the vantage of Pablo the camera mans camera. This technique works in every single shot, but it works to perfection during the climax of the film which is shot in night vision, a sequence that blows the similar climax from ""Silence Of The Lambs"" clean out of the water, and Rec easily blows just about any zombie film out of the water.If you figured the zombie movie was all but dead, you haven't seen this master work of the genre. The actors are so convincing as normal people you will never suspect that they are real actors. The image of the last zombie seen in the film is something made of a real actor, and special effects, I'm not quite sure which it's more of but I know that it will be visiting me in my nightmares.Rec is minimal on plot, but much like the photography it only tells you what you need to know, that's why the film is only 78 minutes long. I'll take a good 78 minutes over a mediocre 90 any day.",REC
217,Moviefreak4653,Original and Thrilling; A movie to keep you on edge.,8,9 December 2009,"REC was a movie that I was eager to see, because not only had I heard nothing but good things about it, but also because I kind of have a place in me that takes a liking for these camcorder films(The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity and so on). I put this in and instantly took a liking to it, for the right reasons. The heroine Angela was very likable, and believable, perhaps not exactly news-anchor type woman, but nevertheless likable. I liked how they slowly built the story (mostly pre-apartment quarantine), and I appreciate the fact that the movie doesn't jump into the zombie aspect ASAP. Many zombie movies (like Vampire ones) kind of have a problem of trying to break clichés, but in the end not doing it all to well. Thankfully in REC they pull it off in a very fun, clever, and original tone. Although they don't entirely provide you with anything new(as far as Zombie stereotype themes or even themes goes), but nevertheless this film can build suspense extremely well, I mean I was watching this in the comfort of my house and still managed to jump out of my seat, and move diagonal to the edge of my seat. I'll admit for this movie to make me want to close my eyes is something thrilling, but fun. Will say although the suspense moments you can clearly see coming, they still manage for you too jump.I will say as far as the downsides go, towards the middle act it seems to get a little off track. Like for example I just wished that as far as the zombie themed went that they should have made a better effort to do more with this tone. Like it seems as though they start to ignore this theme, and try focusing more on the quarantined theme. Now yes I know they wanted out of that building, and since they couldn't I understand why they focused on them being trapped, but when they started to explain the reason as to why they were trapped it seemed as though they were trying to hard to balance two things at once. Also towards the end when they're giving that whole explanation it just seems as though they couldn't come up with much backstory so therefore they just gave it a little effort.Overall REC is a pretty thrilling, creepy, atmospheric, and great horror film. It's one of those horror movies that even non-horror fans can enjoy. Thankfully it can manage to thrill and chill you while still giving you that adrenaline rush of excitement and fun. REC, although it has it's downs, is an enjoyable roller coaster of a horror film, and if you haven't seen it you're missing out on something different, and different these days is a good thing if done right, and here it is.",REC
218,crey014,"Will definitely have a fruitful life on home video, but watching it in communion with a fright hungry audience should still be the best medium.",9,24 July 2008,"Already bound for an American remake, ""Rec"" is another film that uses the shaky handy-cam technique to great effect, as we follow an unassuming reporter enthusiastic on finding a story, only to discover she's become it. Will inspire nervous laughter from the audience to release tension earnestly produced by the film, ""Rec"" works as it eliminates any plot holes that may conspire, as far as zombie movies go. Will definitely have a fruitful life on home video, but watching it in communion with a fright hungry audience should still be the best medium.Angela (Manuela Velasco) is an ambitious reporter stuck in making fluff pieces for late night television. While on a mundane assignment at the fire station, herself and a cameraman follows a keen set of firemen bound to help an old lady get out of her apartment. Trouble is, the old lady becomes the catalyst to this claustrophobic fright-fest. Character development isn't much as a necessity here as the film suggests. When it stops to create characters (more caricatures even), the film's pulse suddenly drops. Empathy is easily produced though as the first man-eater comes to surface.More faithful to the shaky handy-cam genre than the recent blockbuster ""Cloverfield"", the film boasts its grassroots film making as a major part in producing a lot of tension. Everything is used to great effect here: limited frame of view, distortion of sound, the rewind button, the spotlight and the dreaded night-vision. And it owes it to that as the film easily creates suspense and anticipation.George A. Romero, the director of the zombie classic ""Dawn of the Dead"", should be proud as with his film that judges on suburbia and commercialism, ""Rec"" is inspired to make a commentary of its own. Film raises serious topics of xenophobia, immigration (also seen in Almodovar's ""Volver""), biological weapons and collateral damage. Nevertheless, even with such straight-faced ideas, they remain at the back burner well before all hell breaks loose. They remain a part of the plot but not as its driving force.Final 20 minutes is the picture's strongest, as even with an extreme denouement, it still doesn't betray the audience. The origins are convincing in a universe where zombies exist. Imagery of religious piety and an untouched penthouse refreshes sense of paranoia seen when protagonists from ""The Blair Witch Project"" finally discovers the cabin. To contrast with that though, the audience is given a proper possible explanation through exposition, a scene that may feel a bit contrived but nevertheless feeds the main protagonist, Angela, something to chew on. The film doesn't explain because it has to, but it's because the character naturally does.Not for the faint of heart, ""Rec"" is another entry to the new wave of horror films established by the Blair Witch and further cemented by YouTube. The film garners an easy recommend as it delivers what it came to do: produce a lot of scares, further heightened by the sense of dread and tension intentionally delivered by the haphazard lensing.",REC
219,srmeewisse,More hysterical then horrifying,5,3 April 2014,"The rating of the film and the reviews of some members here, made me decide to watch this movie. I agree with the most reviewers that the first minutes of the movie are boring and makes you think ""hm, where's this going"". Now I know that Spanish people can be loud and speak fast and with passion, but this was quite over the top. When the movie finally starts building up some ""horror"", people scream at each other, speak even more fast and lose control. It became so bad and distracting that i even had to turn down the volume. I might be prejudiced because I'm not the type that likes these ""blair witch project"" kind of movies. But even so, this movies is enjoyable but not worth the 7.5 star rating. If the professionals in this movie had a little more calmness or surviving attitude and if some of the bystanders wouldn't scream so much, then yes maybe I would give it a 6 or 7.",REC
220,JayRief,(Spectacular),10,6 March 2019,"I cannot say enough good things about this brilliant horror flick, as it ranks in my top 3 favorite of all time in this genre, and is by far the best found footage iteration out there. The greatest strength of this movie is that it succeeds in making you feel like you're trapped in the building with the protagonists, scared out of your mind, and you don't have the slightest idea what you're even up against, because the filmmakers ingeniously draw out the reveal as long as possible. So many great scares, so much suspense, and filmed so well, you forget a lot of times that it's yet another found footage attempt. This should definitely be on every horror fanatics ""must see"" list, if you haven't done so already. Seriously, it's magnificent.One parting note, and I cannot stress this enough - DO NOT WATCHED THE VERSION DUBBED IN ENGLISH. It's not that I'm a purist, or snub my nose at dubbed foreign films, but this gem loses all of its appeal if not seen in it's original language. That's just how it is.",REC

223,solun-1,Unappealing,1,3 May 2018,"I was hoping for a good horror flick but were disappointed. Fortunately, because of all the good reviews, it is probably just me and you will enjoy this anyway. Good for you. But even though I watched home alone, in the dark of the night as I usually do with horror films, I was not scared. There were very few moments of light suspense. The camera is horrid even for a POV film. The 1998 Blair Witch has ecstatic camera work compared to this. Almost all the actors and especially the main characters are unbearably bad in their roles. They do not feel genuine and their constant shouting and screaming it annoying and out of place in most of the scenes. I just wished they would just die as soon as possilble so I could focus on the suspense build up but that was in vain - until the very last second of the movie, there is constant screaming and unpleasant voice of the main character. Most of the deaths are the most predictable clichés and characters behaving in seriously dumb ways. It felt like watching just a bunch of people with dementia. There was not a single calm person in the movie, nobody who could bring in a minute of silence or just actually think about the situation. As I said, everyone seems to be enjoying this film. So go ahead and see for yourself.",REC
224,mlunsworth,Rec is no wreck,8,14 September 2010,"Watching any horror film on the big screen is bad enough, but when one comes along that's truly terrifying from start to finish, you know the whole cinema will erupt with constant screams. This was indeed the case when Rec was released.Rec softens us up with a gentle introduction in which a TV presenter and her invisible cameraman (through which the entire film is shot) are filming at a fire station late at night. Then comes a distress call about a woman trapped in her apartment, so the TV crew hitch a ride with the firefighters. The focus is then on the apartment, where the building is quarantined, trapping the firefighters and TV crew. What follows is literally a shock-a-minute, breathless blood fest, with the horrible presence of the unexpected. Even the Spanish subtitles aren't enough to put you off this adrenaline-fuelled nightmare.Personally, this is the ultimate hand-held camera movie, with some of the most gruesome deaths ever filmed, and what makes it all the more disturbing is the audience and characters don't know what's infected the residents. I'll admit that the hand-held camera feel does disorientate you slightly, but that's all part of trying to make you leave the cinema to throw up.Unsettling, horrific and above all, original, this is the Blair-Witch of the naughties, and personally, the last time a POV horror has been this effective was John Carpenter's one-shot intro for his 1978 hit 'Halloween'. This is the scariest film I've ever seen, and never have I left the cinema with a sweat on, and a horrible lasting image in my head. Highly recommended (8/10)",REC
225,zwazoever,have your Tylenol handy!,6,20 December 2009,"All through the 89 min I never felt like I was watching a movie,I was just among those trapped in the apartment building.You can't get any more involved than that,the shots are in your face,the people are hysterical,the events kept going downhill until it is just complete and utter chaos.No wonder it left me with such a headache! Nevertheless I give this flick 6/10,it could have scored more in my book if there was less camera shaking and less shouting,at times both seemed over the top. I also never felt the urge to find out or understand the origin of the infection/disease but was more concerned with the tenants fate,I think this has to do, at least in part,with the way the story was developed,putting the emphasis on the killings and hysteria and playing down the events that lead to that.It's too bad because when you remove the gore and the screaming ,the movie suffers from a lack of depth and mystery that classic horror movies are made of. As far as I'm concerned Paranormal Activity still leads the *live footage/amateur video* category.",REC
226,samsara761,A fresh horror mockumentary,7,7 July 2010,"Rec is a fly-on-the-wall, cinema vérité style mockumentary, shot with a shaky camera effect, from the first person's point of view; the soundtrack does not include any music. Beginning with the pretense of shooting a TV piece on the way fire fighters live and work in the fire station, reporter Angela, and her cameraman Pablo show us the story of a vicious infectious disease, which transforms people into rabid animal fiends, and the way those infected are quarantined, together with the few survivors. In any case, the films starts slowly and normally, concealing what is about to happen, but then it escalates more and more till the climax. The directors stated that many times, during shooting, the actors were not fully aware of how the scene would progress, and their genuine surprise in some scenes grants the film an extra dimension, naturalism and credibility. A few flaws could be the over-acting of the lead actress Manuela Velasco (she screams too much!), and the fact that the ending wants to give the viewer an amount of information it did not need to expose, for the sake of the story itself. Both the the mockumentary style and the theme of the zombie infestation are old and cliché, but the directors Jaume Balaguero & Paco Plaza manage to combine them into something new, fresh and actual, managing to pull off a chilling and successful feat, without the massive marketing operation that was behind the success of The Blair Witch Project. The camera, through the operator Pablo, is a character on its own. We experience the whole film through just that single, POV, shaky camera, and this choice aids the establishment of the suspension of disbelief, because of the limitedness of our point of view. The sense of claustrophobia is ever-present, and it contributes to the whole dense atmosphere of the movie. This particular use of the camera also vaguely recalls to the memory certain shoot-em video-games, like Doom, for instance, because of the subdivision of the set in floors and rooms, as well as the POV camera.",REC

It is a lame pseudo-documental material, which wants to create terror using this approach (think of tag line: ""Inspired by true events""), but merely creates a nightmare and lunacy and in this case it IS NOT a compliment!

229,CULTEGUY,"Ohhh, yeah!",9,5 October 2008,"Richard Christie on the Howard Stern Show gave this movie props, so I sought it out. (Props, without any English subtitles, which I have.) I say this movie contains spoilers, but all you have to do is look at the message board and realize it's a zombie movie. I didn't know it going in, but any avid horror movie fan could figure it out from the first 'horror' sequence. And, pretty much true to my other reviews, I won't give anything else away. (Excepting the review I did on another board on ""Brokenback Mountain"" where I give away the gay cowboys 'Do It,' I'm still sorry for the people who were mad at me for giving it away.) (REC,) I think, achieves something that we have tried in Amereca, and failed. It was tried with ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and I hate a movie that uses 'home' looking cinematography as a tool. Not the creator (as is often misrepresented,) but the mastermind behind the zombie phenomenon, George Remero, tried it in his last 'Dead' movie. I admittedly want to see that movie again because I couldn't get into it, and after all George is the man. I din't see ""Cloverfield"" though, and I don't think I want to now.What's Cult talking about? Is Culteguy drunk? Not since this mourning. But what someone was inspired to do was to make, basically, a ""This is Spinal Tap,"" or Christopher Guest's more recent films, and make a serious horror movie. Awesome idea, being as most of the 70's drive in movies were ripped off from different cultures (""Friday The 13th 2 was considered a rip off of Italy's Mario Brava's ""Bay Of Blood,"" that was a sequel!) We could finally find inspiration from our own culture.We tried it in the aforementioned movies, and we got it wrong. Now we're stuck remaking (in the works now) a film from Mexico that was inspired by our own films. Sorry Hollywood, you can't get it right.This bone-tingling, chill inducing flick wasn't even released here. It will prick at your mind long after you see it, and you will not even consider it a 'zombie' flick, just sheer claustrophobia. The actors aren't bad for the sake of 'homage,' and it's not some cheesy DV movie that I could make myself.I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it's been done in different ways before, and, I kind have knew what was coming after seeing as many horror movies as I have.That last part being said, whereas I predicted what was going on right up to the end, I've never been generally as creeped out in the deliverance of the scenes or the end.Also, in all the chaos, the film is aptly titled, and the end explains the necessity of the camera being there like few film have.I highly recommend it.PS: The lead who plays the reporter is yummy looking too.",REC

This one is actually quite well done technically, and the director did a good job at giving it a polished feel otherwise found in bigger budget productions.The problem here is that the characters are downright unlikeable. In fact, since 'Funny Games' I cannot remember any less likable leads. They burst into hysterics the first 10 minutes of the movie, yelling at each others for no particular reason, making racist comments and being generally small minded and petty. I just wanted them all to get bitten by the zombies, but for all the wrong reasons.I don't think the director is making a social statement here either, which is quite worrying considering some of the racist dialog. In terms of range, the only thing the lead actress seem to be able to do is get into a furious rage at the smallest things, for example when a fireman touches 'her' camera, or when her cameraman is unable to help her find keys or turn on the lights.If you like watching snotty middle class Spanish getting angry at each other for one and half hour, by all means, watch this.

Trust me, you can literally feel the terror. Also worth mentioning are the virus's victims, they're not quite zombies but are damn scary! This is one of this film's beauty's, it is so believable. My advice to everyone is to make this your priority movie. In an age where 'horror' means a bunch of students getting hacked apart by a mad axeman, a movie like Rec is such a welcome change.Watch it. You will not be disappointed.",REC
246,Mudsharkbytes,I pity the people who don't get it,9,6 August 2008,"I spent some time reading all the comments on the IMDb about this movie, and up until the last couple of pages the reviews were understandably glowing with a handful of nit-picking low rating comments. I don't know how the IMDb prioritizes the comments, but currently the last few pages of them are a bash-fest of this movie, a petulant dip into the depths of cinematic ignorance and picky insensitivity. Holy crap - how jaded does a person have to be to see this movie and NOT get the bejeezus scared out of them? I have no taste for the current batch of, as George A Romero calls them, ""Torture Porn"" movies that pass for horror these days. I don't want to be grossed out or depressed when I see a horror movie, I want to be exhilarated, and that's precisely what REC does so superlatively.From the mundane fire-house documentary beginning to the freakishly skinny disturbing possessed teenage girl-monster seen through night vision ending, REC amps up the suspense scene-by-scene almost logarithmically. For the first time in my life I found myself wishing I could take a break from the movie, just to catch my breath. There are several genuine moments where I jumped in my seat, and that hasn't happened to me since I was a kid. If you're so jaded that you think this is a bad movie because it has 'cliches' in it, or the color isn't right, or the sound is too loud, or the acting is poor (it isn't, the acting is so good one friend I showed this to didn't know it was a movie until about a half hour into it - I thought she knew it was just a movie), or the camera jiggles, or there wasn't enough gore, or you hate POV movies, or Angela was annoying, etc... then I pity you because your preconceptions and prejudices have prevented you from enjoying an experience I wish I could do over - which would be to see this movie again for the first time. Maybe that's why they're making Quarantined - for those who don't get it.",REC

The movie brings with it a feeling of claustrophobia which creates a tension that builds as the movie progresses to it's jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat climax.Even though this movie is of the shaky camera, zombie flick variety it is done with a slightly different edge making it feel quite original.",REC
253,rjwilli1414,"Too much to say for a proper title other than ""Brilliant""",10,11 October 2012,"This is possibly the best horror movie I have ever seen. The last 30 min will take you to the most intense level of terror imaginable. An absolute masterpiece in my mind.So lets pretend the director and writers were told to make a horror movie on a very low budget, use no images or concepts that haven't been seen before, lackluster acting (or so it seemed because I was watching an English audio version), and leave it open to a sequel while still ending the movie brilliantly.........If that was their task, this is the best movie ever made. How they were able to incorporate such an intense and original feeling to this movie without doing anything original was just unbelievable in my opinion.This movie is very short with a runtime of 75 minutes or so but trust me, they did not even need that much time. The beginning had me skeptical as it seemed rather boring and had me wondering where it was going. Lets just say I'm glad I didn't turn it off. The story builds emotion and horror very well all the way to the end with no letdown. Each minute is more intense than the one before.I am very interested in the sequels and can only hope they compare to this one.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to any horror fan, especially to zombie/infection movie fanatics because all other movies in that category pale in comparison to this. As I said earlier, the only thing this movie lacks is originality (which it does mighty fine without), and stellar acting (good chance the acting was better in the original language vs. the English dubbed version I watched). Watch this movie in a dark room, late at night with no distractions and no pauses and you will wish you had seen this a long time ago.10/10",REC

Only in the zombie genre is every single release compared to one movie, its not 1968 anymore there can't be another ""Night"", now get over it.Now onto REC. This film surprised me, I hadn't even heard of it until a friend pointed me toward it, and I have to say I found it thoroughly enjoyable. No its not original, and no its not going to go down in the annals of horror film lore as an all time great, but its a well made film with a decent story and tons of suspense.Our protagonist is amazingly cute and came across as very believable as documentary maker, and unlike a lot of leading ladies/men in horror films I actually gave a damn what happened to her.REC revolves around a Spanish TV crew filming the everyday life of firemen, and at times you can almost believe thats what you are watching, then they get called out to an apartment building where there has been an incident and thats when all hell breaks loose. I won't ruin anything, but it follows the usual zombie storyline but its done a lot better than most, and you will definitely have a few moments where you grip your armrest a lot tighter.If you are a zombie fan you will love it, if you are a Romero fanboy who thinks every other zombie film should be buried in a deep hole then nothing anyone can say will change your mind, so ignore this and every other film in the genre.",REC

The movie is very intense, as well as being quite entertaining. The ending of the movie just knocked me flat, and some of the other scenes in this film gave me the shivers. Since REC is shot with (what seems to be) a hand-held camera, you feel like you're actually IN the movie at times. I mean, you almost feel as though you're in the apartment with those beasts running towards you. And yes, the zombies actually run for once. If you take an interest in foreign horror/thriller films, you should definitely check REC out. The film is anything but typical horror; it is more extreme than that. Oh yeah, and another thing: don't watch that stupid flick ""Quarantine"". REC is the original film and Quarantine ripped it off. If you want a good watch, do yourself favor and watch REC.

Someone bites someones neck. Five minutes later the bitten gets up and bites someone elses neck, and so on, until they're all gone. There is the traditional creepy young girl, a staple of modern horror films, im sure you can guess what ends up happening with her..Its just not remotely frightening. If your looking for tension, something psychological, deep, truly troubling, this movie isn't for you. If you like every other traditional zombie flick, then give it a go, you might get something from it, a headache most probably from the wobbly cam and incessant screaming. Good luck.",REC

Im glad I watched REC though, because this is a really good movie - even if you are like me: not really into the horror genre. It's a bit hard to talk about the plot this movie without spoiling all the surprises, but I'll give it a try: REC follows a young TV reporter - Angela - and her cameraman who are recording the daily (or I should say: nightly) lives of some local firemen. The firefighters get a call about an old woman who is locked inside her apartment, and from there hell breaks lose. When they appear on the scene they find the woman crazy and all covered in blood. Pretty soon after the firefighters and the TV-crew has arrived, the entire building is put under a quarantine and no one is let out under any circumstances. No one knows why they are being trapped, and as everyone's frustration increases they try to break out of the building. Pretty soon though, they learn that they have other kinds of problem to worry about other than just getting out of there: They have to stay alive against an unknown threat as well.",REC

260,mats_lundberg,OK but not scary,5,21 April 2008,"I was tipped about this movie from a friend and he suggested that I should just watch it without reading anything about it. So I did. The only thing I knew about the movie was that it was Spanish and a horror flick. To begin with I must state that I am not easily scared and there is only a few movies that I have felt scared or at unease e.g. Ringu, Jacob's Ladder, and Sixth Sense.Spoiler warning The premise is that a local (Barcelona) TV team consisting of a man (camera guy) and a young woman reporter joins a firefighter station to make a show/documentary named ""While you are sleeping"". Everything is showed through the camera view so there are no other angles shown. It is documentary style that you may have seen in e.g. Cloverfield or Blair Witch Project (none of them made me scared btw). This also means that you get the odd shots of the floor and shaky movement while running around.The TV team tags along on a routine call to an elderly woman that have supposedly fallen and neighbors have heard screaming. Once there the story starts to unfold and pretty quick you realize that it is a zombie type movie. The disease is transmitted by saliva and bit by bit (no pun intended) the puzzle is revealed. Then there is running and chasing and suspicion. Well, the only good thing is that they all die in the end. ;)The movie is well made but it doesn't scare me. There are a few logic flaws in the movie which for me takes the scare edge out of it even more. I think this movie could be very scary if you are easily scared. Also I think it is better to watch in the cinema than on DVD.If you like zombie flicks and are easily scared then this is your kind of movie.5 of 10 because it is well made but the story is thin and so is acting in some places.",REC
261,emil-karajic,Horror veteran turns into a screaming little school girl.,9,30 July 2010,"Great acting, nicely scaled visuals (not too much non-realistic FX) and nice sound. Check! Now let's get to the point. I'm a horror veteran. I played Silent Hill (PS VG) with headphones, in an empty house, past midnight, with all the lights turned off. I have seen many a King, Carpenter, Barker, Hitchcock, vampire, zombie, serial killer, alien, redneck and ghost movies worth mentioning and even a few not even worth the spit on my shoe. I find gore movies like Hostel to be b o r i n g and redundant! Now let's talk REC.RECI saw this movie in a front row seat in a top quality theater and it was a scary, terrifying and suffocating experience – after years and years of watching recycled, cheap thrill horror I finally found a movie that makes my heart jump. I entered the theater as a horror veteran but by the end of the movie I was a screaming little school girl.Joking aside, the beginning is quite boring, I agree. But toward the end, the way the suspension builds up and the excellent way the movie presents a hopeless situation is incredible. The feeling of self-involvement and identification one perceives in this motion picture was astonishing for me. This is mostly due to the first person camera perspective of the flick. Plus the whole movie just feels authentic. From the panicked actors to the realistic settings, the whole thing just screams »This is happening right now, next door to you! «.So the best thing about REC is the atmosphere and identification potential it brings to the viewer. Story wise it's pretty much »Been there, done that. « (Until you watch REC 2, where the story picks up exactly where REC left it, and it has some nice twists and turns). So if you have a chance to watch REC and REC 2 back to back – do it.If you like horror movies and want for a good scare, watch this onealone, with headphones, in an empty house, past midnight, with all the lights turned off. You won't regret itI didn't.",REC

265,murdoc995,OK. A genuine gem to horror.,10,12 July 2008,"So many have commented positively on this little gem, it's hard to agree with someone, but I will anyway. I LOVED this film. It has everything a horror fan could love. From story, terror, to characters, REC delivers. I'll start with a general summary; -A news reporter and her loyal cameraman follow a fire-crew into the bowers of an infested apartment without notice. The infestation consists of zombie-esqe victims, attacking any and all for sustenance. Along with the fire crew, police officials and apartment tenants, the reporter and firemen fight against up unsurmountable odds to survive the night.As I watched this film, keep in mind I watched in subtitles. I will say in response however, I don't care. This film was superb in every dimension and I was no less than impressed. From a filmographers point-of-view, this was to become a basic run-of-the-mill POV zombie-flick, but beat the sub-standard and became an instant(soon to come, I promise) cult-classic. The story itself is very interesting, providing it's beginning which consist's of the reporter and her cameraman getting to know the fire department. It then proceed's with a terror-filled vision into the apartment and never seems to let down EXCEPT to allow time for character-development and suspense-building.The main characters of Angela Vidal(Manuela Velasco) and Manu(Ferran Terraza) give nothing but genuine performance. Velasco makes you BELIEVE this reporter is out for NOTHING but the Truth, and follows through with that of her anonymous cameraman Pablo. The firefighter Manu(Terraza) also gives his excellent dramatic effect to add on as the accident-prone hero.REC definitely adds the scares, confidence and bravado of any of the US's latest mainstream P-O-V(point of view) horror films! Definitely check-worthy!",REC
266,bruyve,"You Might Press ""Stop"" Before The End",5,10 September 2014,"The Blair Witch Project has much to answer for in sparking a glut of hand-held camera POV and found-footage would-be scare flicks. But whereas Blair Witch at least invoked an eerie sense of foreboding and was, if not scary, at least original, most additions to the genre have been more tiresome than terrifying. So it is with this Spanish schlocker, in which a pair of TV reporters follow a crew of firemen to a call-out in an apartment block only to find themselves trapped inside by a lock-down following the outbreak of some infectious disease. Said disease turns its victims into those staples of horror movies, zombies. Much running around and screaming ensues.The gimmick of the hand-held camera POV adds nothing to the story or the suspense, to the extent that the movie might have even worked better filmed in a traditional format. Belief is beyond suspension at times when the camera operator keeps filming rather than taking more logical recourse, like running away or something.The dubbing detracts further from the intended effect, and is at times unintentionally comedic. In particular, the odd mix of accents jars: English, American, Chinese. Few sound convincing. There's too much jabbering and general over-reaction.There are few plot twists worthy of the name, and most developments are rather predictable. The effects are reasonable enough, and the last ten minutes provide the few genuine scares on offer. You may well have lost patience before then though.",REC
267,patrickslamin,Decent but Overrated Zombie Horror,6,17 December 2016,"I had high expectations for this, being a huge horror fan and seeing this on many top horror film lists and its rating on this site. Having now patiently sat through the whole thing, I am slightly at a loss as to how it has the rating it has.It has some good features - its unnerving at times, the pacing is excellent and it's a decent zombie runout if you're into that type of thing, but I just didn't find it scary at all. Maybe i've just got used to them, but the whole infection/quarantine/zombie attack thing has already been done a gazillion times and a lot more convincingly than this - its essentially a low budget Shaun of the dead with some questionable acting and without the (intentional) comedy. For one, the plot was utterly unconvincing - full government quarantine within 6 minutes of a box standard fireman call (and 1 minute from when they realised it there was a problem) ? The ridiculous commitment of the cameraman and the female lead to their jobs as everyone around him gets ripped to shreds by zombies? The fact they shut in the place down in the first 10 minutes when everyone could have got out safely there and then? Why, if they knew what was going on, wouldn't they just go in and shoot everything already infected?If it didn't try to be something other than a standard entertainment scare-fest that focuses less on trying to be a 'good' film in its own right then it wouldn't matter - but it doesn't and it isn't even particularly scary.If you're after the kind of film that makes you want to look away and crawl up into the foetal position in fear, then stick to the 'sinister,' 'the conjuring' or 'the ring' types. ""The orphanage"" is another Spanish horror, and its not only a lot more scary but an infinitely better film in its own right. Intelligent, suspenseful, innovative and really well shot.

Since it finished, I've been walking restlessly around the room, unable to sit still, suffering from exhilaration basically, and slightly shredded nerves.I mean, wow, what a brilliant movie! The shaky POV camera works really well here, I think, and although not as startling as it was in The Blair Witch Project, it's used more assuredly and to better effect. In fact the familiarity of the means and method only deepened my unease. Also, although some reviewers seemed disappointed by them, the low key special effects were fine by me, they added to the sense of dread and unfolding catastrophe, of a very ordinary night gone wrong in the worst possible way.And when the shocks came they shocked, the gore disgusted, and the panic was contagious.

In that way, the movie keeps you on your toes. However, I must say that the leading character screams way too much.

Once they are inside they have to stay inside with the horror that's among them. Angela, the television reporter, is played by Manuela Velasco.

But once they are called to an emergency, things get really ugly. In the beginning she just want to make a nice show and give a proper view on what's happening before and during an emergency. But this emergency is not quite what anyone could expect. Angela is no after answers and desperately needs to know what is happening and why. Pablo the cameraman is the one who records everything. Sometimes I just thought: ""Dude, put down that camera and help the others!"" He's the only person we never see but the actor Pablo Rosso makes sure we get to see an exciting horror film, a bit unsteady sometimes which is only normal with Found Footage films.REC is a horror film that never really get that scary. The suspense is very real though, but first you need to get through the boring part inside the barracks. Like I mentioned before, the first 20 - 30 minutes of the film are like a normal documentary about firefighters. What they do at night when everybody else is asleep is something Angela and Pablo wants to find out. When they find themselves locked inside an apartment, along two firefighters - Manu (Ferran Terraza) and Alex (David Vert) - two police agents and the residents, Angela and Pablo get more than they bargained for. Once we see what's happening inside a certain home, we already know what we are dealing with. Therefore some things are very predictable and when you are familiar with Found Footage films, you know how this film ends.The lack of typical horror music is a relief. It doesn't push you in a certain direction of give you some kind of expectation. Therefore the surprise is bigger when something happens, but some might still think it's too predictable. There was one moment I was really surprised, but in general I saw things coming from a distance. The attacks are very freaky though, predictable or not, they look very scary. Definitely no jump scares. There is also no sympathy for the characters. If they live or the die, who cares. They do get very scared and freak out at some point. When someone from outside enters the building, events takes a drastic turn and Angela get some of her answers. But what she and Pablo find in the apartment on the highest floor, raises more questions. Therefore the film seems unfinished. Evil has not been defeated and the building is still in lock down. Maybe ""REC 2"" gives the answers but to me one film is enough.REC is a Found Footage horror film that is for most people quite predictable. Once the boring part - that looks like a normal documentary about firefighters - is over, the excitement starts. The film doesn't have a typical horror score, but the tension is there. No jump scares though or sympathy for the characters, but the attacks look very real and creepy. There is a second and third film in this Spanish series, but I don't see the need to watch them.",REC

I had no idea what to expect going in but most of the reviewers made me think it would be absolutely terrifying. Instead I was board watching the same ol' same ol' zombie scenarios play out...and I'm a huge chicken! I've seen far better (and scarier) episodes of The Walking Dead.
To give it the benefit of the doubt, I watched a version dubbed in english so the acting was probably worse than the original. That being said the dialogue is just agonizingly bad.
The ending is surprising and a little scary but overall not worth it.",REC
279,demonchessmaster,Now THIS is how a good horror movie should be done!,10,21 March 2009,"Filmed in a similar way to Cloverfield and Blair Witch--but far superior than both of them, this Spanish film is a real treat for horror fans. Following the tried and tested method of having a hand held, shaky camera and following the characters around, we see the horror that unfolds before our very eyes. Their fear is our fear and we end up getting emotionally drawn into the stories as (one by one) the characters slowly get killed of in gory ways. Luckily, this film doesn't rely too much on gore, but rather in suspense, starting off with a very mundane story about a camera crew following around firemen--before delving into a hellish nightmare where there is no escape. This is the way good horrors should be done, creepy atmosphere, full on scares and a lingering feeling of dread that lasts ages after the films finished. Definitely check this one out--but avoid the remake if possible.",REC

281,Aemaeth,Ho Hum...,3,2 May 2009,"'Rec' is a film that very much wanted to scare me. It tried very hard. Certain sequences were executed well but in the end it was just a big mess held together with loose string. At several points the plot was moved forward by one or another character doing something stupid and illogical. I realize we're supposed to assume that in a survival situation people will act foolishly but by the end of the movie I was laughing out loud at all the silliness. I find a horror movie far more compelling when the characters work together toward a common goal of survival. For example (and I realize this film has many faults but merely as an example) 'Vacancy' was a horror film in which two characters were placed in an extreme survival situation and thought through their predicament to come up with solutions-and this is a terrific way to simultaneously produce character development and push the story forward. It also has the added effect of not letting the writers get away with simplistic solutions to complex plot developments. Other examples that come to mind: 'John Carpenter's The Thing,' and 'Alien.'This was essentially 75 minutes of people screaming and biting each other-not compelling.",REC

The story needs a while to get going, but after that: Take no prisoners! The last 15 minutes are the most terrifying I've seen since THE DESCENT! And I watched a lot (crappy) horror flicks. Talking 'bout crappy horror flicks, the leading lady (Scream Queen) in REC, is a sweet one! She reminded me of a young Alissa Milano. Nice!

As scared as she's suppose to portray, she didn't have to keep yelling throughout the whole movie. Although some of the other actors did over-do their roles in some scenes, they weren't as irritating. Some of the setup was obviously done to lead viewers for some scary moments but it seemed contrived & amateur making me feel as if i was an idiot audience.

With clear references to Blair Witch Project, REC is a great demonstration of a good filmmaker and scariest surprises. The big component of the movie is to be with vulgar persons in a vulgar building, and, this way, we enter in the universe of the movie as if it be ours. I was suspense for 80 minutes, and I think that in actual days is very difficult find a movie with a terror quality of this one. The Award won in Fantasporto is fair and justified. I will go to the theater with no perspectives about it and I enjoyed very much. Highly recommended, a big time of emotions.",REC

I loved Cloverfield, Blair Witch, Cannibal Holocaust, Quarantine, and this movie just adds to my list. The only thing is that, I'm sorry to say this, but I liked Quarantine better than REC.Yes, shoot me down but I have my reasoning. I liked how Quarantine had the guy walking like a zombie but with a broken angle because it caused some build up and the vet explaining the foaming mouth being symptoms of rabies but I guess all this is made up when you watch REC 2, and yes you should watch that once you're done with this.Overall the acting was superb, the story was epic, and the ending was very good. If you love ""found footage"" movies like me then please watch this and if you want a good scare then you should also watch this as well.Rating: 8/10 - I wish there was more explanation of what could have been going on and I wish more would have happened with the infected victims instead of stuff hitting fan full speed.",REC

298,admiral_andrews,Promisses horror and actually delivers,8,27 April 2008,"Now, I'm the kind of horror fan who gets jumpy during a movie and then lets go, but Rec. truly had a lasting impact on me.I had a couple of jumps while watching movies such as 1408, Wolf Creek, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, 28 weeks, 30 Days of Night, The Mist, pretty much every zombie movie and Oriental horror flicks, but hardly any of these really had stuck with me long after seeing them.Rec. is not blood and guts all over the place. Instead it builds atmosphere and goes to your brain more than your eyes, with cuts and fast-forwards that make you anticipate what may go wrong next. Action is frantic, with running and shouting all over the place (too much shouting) but complemented with a very effective feeling of claustrophobia as you really have nowhere to go and the darkness reduces your field of vision to very little (old and effective trick). As the movie goes on, you may convince yourself there's really no way to escape and  as did I  you'll find yourself begging the movie to end fast to put an end to people's misery. I didn't feel this feeling of impending doom or hopelessness with any of the aforementioned movies.The zombies/infected were not always convincing, but they were grotesque in some details of their presentation, more than their aspect, and how they were dealt with in the absence of fancy machine guns and heroic martial arts. Then there's a twist that will at least make the origin of all the trouble, something you can objectively look at. That's an element that the movie adaptation of ""I Am Legend"" lacked: zombies were pointless, indistinguishable, no character, no history. Here, since you are in a controlled, tight environment, not in a widespread zombie/virus/vampiric pandemic, and even though most characters don't live that long, the horror is more personal. These are common folks, like those you see every day.If you really need carnage all the way, you may dislike Rec.. But if horror for you is atmosphere, tension, suspense, rather than witless mayhem, Rec. will almost certainly play with your inner fears and reflexes, sticking to your mind even when you want to forget it.",REC
299,andrefbento,Making an horror movie is not just about scaring people...,4,14 April 2008,"This movie is not so good as some people are claiming it is...To start with, the performance of the actors is bad... They should act like if everything was really happening, but this really doesn't work and the dialogues usually seem very staged and forced, specially in the scenes where the characters say more than just small words. Sometimes it is also possible to sense that the actors are not scared and that they are just performing... The actors direction was not very good here.The lighting and sounds of the movie usually do not seem very real as well. Lots of time we get the feeling that everything is being staged, with certain special lightnings, sounds, etc... The idea of seeing the rewinding or forwarding of the tape is so much original as stupid... These options in the cam are only applicable for viewing and not recording... We lose a lot the reality sensation when these effects are used! And the subject of the movie is so, so, so, so much explored... There are countless movies about zombies. Why don't the directors try to create new themes for horror movies? For instance, I really preferred the idea of Cloverfield: creating a new monster adapted to our times, which basically has not soul and whose purpose is to unstoppably destroy like if there was no tomorrow. But come on... Zombie movies? Bah...There are also features in the movie that just don't make sense. I will just refer one: why doesn't a special tactical squad enter into the building in order to restore the order inside it? Not even one policeman has accompanied the doctor when he arrived at the building! Yes, I know, they wanted to contain the disease, but... That is why gas masks and special suits were created! Was there really a dilemma for the police, between letting all those persons die or take the risk that the disease would spread to all the population? Maybe not...And then, finally, the handicap of all these movies filmed with a hand-held camera: how the hell would the journalist had the camera on in 70% of the movie, even when it is being eaten up by a monster close to the end? In order to make a good horror movie, it is necessary to add other elements than those required for scaring people... Like for instance having good actors, an original concept and a good script... Which this movie doesn't.",REC
300,sakie3,Generic and uninspired zombie romp,3,26 June 2013,"It's hard to understand the glowing reviews that this film has received. What starts out as a boring, behind-the-scenes style filming for a show that, based on its title, knows no one would bother watching, quickly dissolves into the same old found footage clichés and tropes you'd expect. This was meant to draw some sort of dissonance between normality and horror, but there's little difference in the level of intrigue between the first latter halves of the film. The second half just has far more screaming and all the sins that plague this genre.We have the cameraman whose only physical characteristic is being the cameraman and is unable to put it down even to help someone being killed in front of him. Then a constant thread of conversation is two people arguing whether or not to turn the camera off, which of course doesn't happen. The lights inexplicably turn off, forcing the camera to use its on-board flashlight, setting up for jump scares that are predictable the second the lights go out. The camera even manages to magically stay focused on the action at hand even while the operator is running backwards, is in a space far too small to accompany, or, most egregiously, *spoiler* while the cameraman is mauled to death.The story itself isn't anything new or even exciting for that matter. The first scene of any horror in this film is the same we see in any zombie movie out there. A character has turned his back to an obviously unnatural situation and is bitten. From there we hit all the checklist boxes for a zombie film. People are quarantined off, no one is told or knows what's happening, police are useless, little girl is introduced for sympathy, people start coming back from the dead (which we never address but I digress), we find out it's a virus passed through saliva, and on and on. I won't give away the final scene, not that I would need to, but towards the end our main character just gives up on acting all together. The last twenty minutes simply involve what can only be described as her attempt to rupture her own vocal cords before the film ends. Aside from this, we get to see her comically pull an entire desk drawer out and manically dump all its contents to grab a pair of keys that were clearly right on top of it and in plain view. Then it's a mad rush to find an exit that is completely forgotten about from one scene to the next in favor of introducing plot points superfluous to the movie since they're shown five minutes before the end. I'm not a cynic of all found footage; there are a few I genuinely enjoy, so I don't want this review to make it seem that I disliked this film due to its choice of medium. Rather, if this movie was shot like a normal film I believe it would be even more monstrously dull than it currently stands.

A group of people are isolated in a building with a virus that makes people go crazy and kill people. Seeing this through a camera like if you were part of the action makes it very creepy. The beginning of the movie is very boring but after they enter the building it becomes a true nightmare. As this is a low budget the actors are almost acting for the first time but still make a pretty decent performance.This movie is the best hand-held camera Horror film out there, even better than paranormal activity in my opinion.

The story is nothing to write home about, even though the writers obviously tried to include a few twists in order to make it not quite so cliché. But that's not really important for a horror film. Atmosphere is, and Rec delivers it in spades. If you think the documentary-style is a bit old by now, think again: Rec manages to immerse you into the movie - you might not realize that until the credits have rolled. The acting is superb throughout, the setting is believable and direction and camera-work are top-notch.

I had to watch a less scary movie afterward to get to sleep that night (Friday the 13th remake, meh). The film does start of rather slow, and to be honest I really didn't really see how this was going to become scary, as the Blair Witch didn't excite me to much either. A good 15 minutes in the film picks up, okay now it's starting to interesting, though my initial thought was ""oh dear, they're taking a particular genre and mixing it with shaky cam and taking it a bit too seriously, oh dear."" In all honesty, the 1st 30mins of the film I didn't find particularly interesting, aside from a few genuine unexpected wtf moments. Now I know this is starting to sound a bit negative, but trust me. In the next ten minutes, things started picking up considerably and I was starting to get a little tense. I had actually been paying attention, and as such been absorbing the slow building atmosphere. Then came perhaps the most intense 20mins of my life. A film I had until that point not been considering that great, suddenly showed me what it was made of. What followed was a horror shock after horror shock, until the very last unsettling and truly frightening 10mins. If I recall correctly, I didn't breathe till the credits began to roll.

306,JasonGOrtiz,Scariest Movie I've Seen In Many Years.,10,8 April 2008,"It's such a shame to me that this movie will go widely unnoticed by American audiences who will only be aware of the upcoming remake. In my opinion, and I know that it happens to be an opinion shared by many others on this site, there is no need to remake this film. A strong marketing campaign for this original work would be a more fitting route, albeit less successful financially. And that is the problem: Money. It's sad to me that the art of film is often sacrificed for financial gain, but hey, it's a business.So, on to the movie itself. Wow. Honestly, and this isn't me just trying to beat my chest in a declaration of machismo, I don't get scared by movies much. It only happens every couple of years. I still watch horror movies all the time. In fact probably 75% of the movies I watch are horror/thriller/suspense/gore or whatever you wish to call them. Needless to say, I've seen just about every ""scary"" movie out there. I guess the reason I watch so many is the desire to be scared. I'm ""chasing the dragon"" if you will. I love being scared by a movie. I don't know if I've become desensitized or films today just aren't as scary. Maybe it's a combination of the two.At any rate, it's not often that a movie comes along that truly scares me. This one did. And it did it well. And often. It was true white-knuckled, heart-pounding, ""Holy Crap!"" scary. I know a movie is really frightening when my girlfriend becomes completely silent while watching. Where normally every ten minutes there's a ""Why'd he do that?"" or a ""I bet she's lying!"" or even ""I think that zombie looks really fake."", with this movie there was just silence. Paralyzed silence. Because I watch so many horror movies, by default she does as well.We've seen it all and while this one treads familiar waters: i.e. contagious virus, zombies, characters stuck in one location, documentary style filming, etc.; it does it in a way that feels fresh. What it does extremely well, and better than ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield"" in my opinion, is using the one hand-held camera in a way that feels like a director is putting a lot of time and thought into the shots without taking away from the intimacy or realism.The plot is original where it needs to be and the ending is anything but a let down. In fact this is one of those movies that when it ends, and after you wipe the poop out of your pants, you have to talk about it. Theories are discussed, opinions are formed, new things are learned; it's a definite ""water-cooler"" film.I felt like giving it a 10, but I always reserve that for movies that have been out for a significant amount of time. But I have a feeling that this little gem might earn that right in the future.So check this movie out before ""Quarantine"" comes out and you will not be disappointed.

307,momoney94,Over the top acting with very little scary believable scenes,3,13 August 2012,"Really disappointing after watching this for 1 hour and 30 min. Was expecting much more from this film after seeing the trailer which brought so much hype. The plot is based on a film presenter and her cameraman going to a house along with a fire brigade team. But they arrive to find such shock which is some sort of contagious mutilation disease which one of the tenants had inhabited. So you can already see its your typical zombie Apocalypse movie. Its a shame cause this film could of pulled off something much more intense and believable if only the acting wasn't so poor.Because the acting was so poor the movie became silly in which it just made you want to laugh and not take it serious especially when a zombie comes running at the camera! But i suppose the directer is the one to blame as he did write the script and organised the actors to be that way. All in all a big disappointment and not really worth watching. There are better scary movies out there similar to this such as the Paranormal Activity movies, at least in them films its more intense/unexpected throughout.",REC

I always search for horror films which do not show much violence or nudity and so I liked this one a lot.What I enjoyed most was the fact that in spite of having a supernatural theme, the atmosphere was realistic and as a result more terrifying (clearly influenced by works such as The Blair Witch Project). Just when you begin to think you can predict the course of events, things take an unexpected turnThe only problem was that Manuela Velasco seemed to be overacting in some scenes. And of course although there are some good camera views, I think another problem is that camera shakes the whole time which is certainly irritating for some viewers and – I think- was not necessary.",REC

Maybe I am just old fashioned, but this movie is nowhere near Helloween, Rosemary's baby, The Omen, etc.First, it is a really short movie, 70 minutes, they should have chosen bigger building. Bigger building, more apartments, potential zombies, longer movie. Second, script is pretty much non existing, with its flaws. Third, acting is not convincing, for the situation they're describing, reactions would be much more intense. Comparing this movie with similar hand-held cam style movies... In my opinion Blair Witch had much better atmosphere, mystique around it. Don't get carried away with hype comments around it. I did...Check director's earlier work Sin Nombre, proper movie with characters, story behind it and weird end.",REC

This Spanish low budget film unexpectedly did.Rec consists of classic horror movie elements so in many aspects it is not really original. Still, it is brilliant how all these are combined with simple and smart directorship to give an absolutely terrifying -in the good sense- result. This film does not try to frighten you with obscene gore scenes and loud sudden sound effects. It pulls you in gradually and drags you to a night of horror. This style kind of reminds me Michael Haneke's films.I won't ramble about it anymore. Call your friends over on a Friday night, or even if nobody wants to come, grab some pop corn and a soda, shut off the lights and enjoy this good horror film.",REC

I don't scare easy. When I watched this movie, though, and I'm really not kidding about this...I had to pause the movie at the climax, watch an episode of Friends to relax a little, and then I finished the movie with a lower volume than I started it. You can call me a wuss or whatever you want, but I seriously could NOT have sat through the ending if I hadn't done that. This movie is AMAZING. It will keep you nervous for a good 90% of the time. There is no score in it, obviously, so there can be no warning or very little warning when a scare is coming. The surprises in it are perfect and amazing. This movie has become one of my favorite horror movies of all times. I don't ever comment movies, but I thought this movie deserved a comment to let other people know how amazing and horrifying it is. If you're looking for a GOOD scary movie that WILL scare you and keep you nervous, watch this. Seriously. I'm not even kidding. I had NEVER had to pause a movie to relax before watching the ending. And believe me when I tell you that I do not scare easy. I'm used to these movies and I watch them all the time. But this one was just what I was looking for and I love it now. I give it a 10/10 and my full recommendation for all horror fans who are looking for a movie to really scare you (given that no good scary movies have been made lately, to be honest). So yeah, watch it.",REC

I truly believe I was there and felt the panic in every character.

314,jamesedcollyer,"Excellently put together, scary and just plain fun",8,28 April 2019,"The mockumentary/found footage horror sub-genre is a difficult world, bringing us some of the best and worst films of the past few years. Thankfully [Rec} is one of the former.The goal of this movie seems to have been to present something that is traditionally pretty goofy (zombie infestation) in the most raw and realistic way possible and man does it deliver in spades. The horror in this film is just excellent, ranging from eerie suspense, heart pounding terror and the odd (unusually well-done) jumpscare thrown in for a good laugh.From what I've seen the main criticism of the film seems to be from it's acting, and for the most part I'd have to disagree. Yes, the main character screams all the time, but wouldn't you? The mockumentary format is helpful in covering any potentially weird acting choices because the film isn't meant to feel rehearsed. Whereas an awkward silence or stumbled line in a Hollywood blockbuster could be put down to poor dialogue or acting, here it made the film feel more grounded and real. While it may be an excuse, I do genuinely think it improved the experience of the film that the characters mostly seemed like confused, awkward bystanders dealing with an unfolding horror rather than an A-list celebrity eloquently delivering witty quips.The ending scene is iconic, but a little lame story-wise. By the end it appears as though the director suddenly decided we needed an in-depth explanation of the events leading up to the story,, but really this just made the film drag a little as we're beaten over the head with some weird and unnecessary exposition. Thankfully this is quickly forgotten as we barrel straight into the film's fantastic finale.This one is a must-see for horror enthusiasts, it is clever, expertly made and actually scary, entirely unlike its American remake.",REC

I feel I DESERVE to get my money back, actually.The hole movie is a complete rip-off, some kind of Blair Witch meets Cloverfield, but with nothing positive in it. I mean... how many movies have we seen that consist in ""misterious virus that makes people irrationally aggressive""? This one just picks up an already too old storyline and adds nothing new to it.I've seen many viewers praise the ""scare-scenes""... I found them completely predictable, and absolutely none of them were really that scary. I like to be scared in movies, I actually seek the ones who do that, and many succeed. This one does not. They were so obvious, so cliché... it actually makes it revolting.The acting is not the worst part, but I can't consider it good. I've seen many good Spanish acting, and considering the awards this one got, I thought I would see some in here. But I didn't. The biggest disappointment was Manuela Velasco... but then again, it was not the worst part.Overall, a deep negative rating for this one.

The hype was huge but the film was about as huge as an umpa lumpa that had just had a miraculous leg operation that didn't work.The film was far too short, yet a good first half of the film was filled with Angela bleating on about filming her stupid show which became annoying. As it seemed the main focus was on the fact the film was being recorded using a typical camera for this particular show. Instead of people panicking a little more and putting their focus's on staying alive.I would say that this film is not entirely bad and there are a few moments that make you jump. For example the sequence in the attic. But apart from the ending when suddenly all the action was clumped into one, the film became a little boring. This was also due to dry dialogue.I wouldn't dismiss this film as been complete rubbish, I would just say don't believe the hype.",REC

Coming to REC, a little over an hour in length, I assumed that this movie would be a good horror/thrill ride after reading some of the comments here. Boy, was I wrong. This movie made me jump out of my seat.The movie started out pretty well and pretty usual for a horror movie. The build up was good for the first 20 minutes but things started to get a little boring for the next 20 minutes. But then what a movie it turned out to be in the second half. The slow and boring build up in the middle phase actually worked to the movie's advantage. There were some unanswered questions but there was no space to think about such stuff in the midst of the chaos presented in the film.The Shaky cam style shooting worked amazingly well for this movie unlike Cloverfield where I was simply telling ""put the damn camera down and run for your life"".My conclusion: Endure the first half and you would end up saying that it was worth it.",REC

REC was a great movie from storyline to acting to production. A simple idea, camera crew joining the local firefighters during one of their call outs. The building is in the middle of the city but because it's quarantined by the authorities the people locked inside are helpless against a rapidly spreading infection which turns people into scary violent cannibals. The end is probably the scariest part which just adds to the brilliance of this movie. The subtitles bit was a bit annoying especially if you'd seen this movie in theatre but there isn't much dialogue anyway so we coped well. Awesome movie and worth the time, effort, and money.",REC

It is plagued with obvious inconsistencies and highly predictable twists. The characters talk (yell) too much and argue senselessly throughout the course of the movie. The immersive effect of seeing through of the eyes of the cameraman is annihilated by the desire to escape this environment where everybody is yelling at each other constantly. All I was wishing for the duration of this movie was for characters to die faster so I would have to deal with so many dB. The only scene that was remotely interesting was the one at the end where you get the impression there is more to this than just stupid people making a racket. My advise is if you saw some of the good horror movies of the last decades and appreciated their *not so cheap trills* approach to horror than don't waste your time with this movie.If you just want to see a story about chaos done in a chaotic way than this movie will satisfy.",REC

In fact, the Spanish emergency services must have shuddered to see how unprofessionally they were portrayed in this film even allowing for artistic license. As for the tv crew, took an instant dislike to the pushy anchor keeping my fingers very firmly crossed she'd be the first casualty of whatever it was that was inside the building. Unhappily and rather predictably, though, she wasn't. I'm very rarely lucky in this area of film viewing. As for poor put-upon Pablo, I'll just have to wait and see if a Zombie Pabs emerged from the carnage but that very much depends upon whether I can summon up the will to watch REC2. Just now, I'm thinking not. And that was that. If your idea of a good horror is loads of blood, lots of shouting, poorly drawn characters and not much plot, you'll love this. Me? Not so much.

However, even though I wont spoil it by revealing anything, the final 20% of the movie gets so off the wall, my opinion of the movie plummeted. Sure, it wasn't what I expected it to be, but I figured there would be a little bit more explained instead of one of those endings where they said 'lets turn this on its head and see what people think'. I just thought the ending and explanation was somewhat goofy and didn't really fit with the rest of the movies theme. However, as a suspenseful horror flick, this movie is fantastic. Still, I think things could have come together a lot differently in the end then when they did. It just got too goofy to really follow. The good part is, though, when what's going on is explained, there's only about ten minutes left in the movie so you'll be spared a ""waste of time"" since, like I said, the first 80% of the movie was fantastic!",REC

If you know POV horror films or zombie films they are usually derivative and lacking in originality, they succeed largely through a the films own re imagining and retelling. This film works due in part to the small (obviously budget constrained) set, the space is used well with the lighting adding to the claustrophobia and unease, There are some nice ideas and some really good playing with common audience panicky fears.

326,kowski-731-276936,I really enjoyed it. A truly fantastic horror movie.,9,9 July 2011,"Like many people, the horror genre is my favourite and I thoroughly enjoy most films striking out from that genre and onto the big screen. Rec was an exception in that I found it, quite possibly, the best horror film I've ever seen. Seen as I have less negatives to offer about this film then positives, I'll start there: 1) Some of the characters are downright idiotic. Not that this isn't absent from many films, but the whole ""Don't go in there you fool!"" really does strike it rich in several scenes in this film. Again, popular among many horror films, but it is quite prevalent in some scenes here. 2) Some of the scenes are made difficult to focus on given the shuddering and rapid movement of the camera. Its hard to keep track of what's really going on when the cameraman is bolting up a flight of stairs and the camera is moving all over the place. However, these are merely two minor points, and they really don't endanger the solid performance the film puts in. The much more prevalent and numerous positives now: 1) Again, a stunning horror film. Whilst occasionally making it hard to focus as aforementioned, the hand-held view of the camera really gives the viewer a feeling of being right in the action and puts you, literally, face-to-face with the horror of the film. 2) 99% of the acting is brilliantly done, and although (to myself anyway) its spoken in a foreign language, the actors convey their horror and the terrific atmosphere brilliantly. 3) A nod towards the ""infected"" actors, too. As with 28 Weeks/Months later, the direction that those playing the infected received was really quite fantastic. All human emotion is devoid and you can really tell that these people are now no more then savage animals, broken to instinct alone without morality. Everything, even down to the way they move, is done fantastically. 4) The confined atmosphere of a tower block couldn't be a more appropriate place for such an outbreak. No where to run, nor hide and completely focused on what's up/down the stairs at all times. This is what survival/horror movies should attempt to do more often, in my opinion, is bring the world together into a smaller area. Not span it across an island or continent; sure for larger situations its needed, but sometimes a more direct group, stranded and without hope in a tiny area really forces it to explode with atmosphere, horror and simple fear. I could go on and on about the positives, but watching it for yourself I'm sure many will recognise this as a terrific horror film that really captures the essence of fear. Truly, remarkably well done and a solid plot, cast and mix between action and details make this a perfect film for any horror fan, from the one or two horror films watched to the die-hard horror genre fanatics.",REC

I can't find any critic for this movie except that are to many violent scenes and because that, movie is not for the people with high pressure or weakly heart. This movie remember me on video game Resident Evil and Silent Hill and the atmosphere is exactly like in these horror video games.

Someone asked how the block could become infected by the one girl up in the attic. I'm assuming that the area of her confinement would include water tanks, air duct pipes and so on, so I didn't have a problem with that. One question, once they become infected I would've thought they would attack anything that moved (including each other) whereas in the film they only seem to go after those who remain uninfected/affected.

A bubbly, ambitious TV journalist reports on the seemingly dull sedentary life of an urban fire station and a call to help a strange old lady locked in her apartment hardly seems worthy covering. The chaos, mayhem and trauma that erupts when the old lady plunges her teeth into the neck of the previously sympathetic fireman is simply sensational.This is not a casual Zombie movie but the usual rules of contamination apply.

There is nothing amateur or gimmicky about REC.

But the filming, the sense of dread, the scares are all good.Many people are claiming this movie takes the handy cam POV from Cloverfield and Diary of the Dead but this movie came out at least 6 months before any of those movies did. This is a much better movie than Diary and I can't compare to Cloverfield...completely different movie.I enjoyed this short, low budget movie.

342,apervanas,Slow Going - No Horror,4,16 May 2011,"With such a high rating amongst other viewers and with the genre horror attached to ""Rec"" I was very excited to watch this movie. Unfortunately this was not a movie I would ever watch again, recommend to anyone, and if I could I would get the last hour of my life back. While this movie was okay it was filmed ""home-movie"" style much like ""Blair Witch Project"" or ""Cloverfield"". It took the whole movie to set up the plot and it only came together in the last five minutes. A lot of the movie seemed wasted on meaningless setups that could have been taken out and the movie still would have made sense. The acting in the movie was very good and that is really where the rating comes from and only the acting gave this movie an okay rating. Personally I love horror movies and that's why I picked this movie to watch. However I was unhappy with the results. Most of the ""horror"" was some blood with a touch of gore. Once it got into the movie and you follow the crew to the apartment there's some action but nothing really scary. Finally in the last five minutes there was one part where I jumped but that was the one and only time and it was a cheap scare. Overall unless you hate horror movies I really wouldn't watch this. You could watch ""28 Days Later"" and get an extremely similar movie on a larger scale with some better quality.",REC
343,nathanlyons1234,Average movie with few jump scares,7,15 June 2013,In my opinion Rec was an alright movie. It did have its jump scares and had very creepy moments.Since I watched the movie in Spanish it was actually better in some ways gives mystery i guess.Being that the recording was for 'While your sleeping' it did give a extra kick for the movie because of how annoyed and angry people got when the cameraman got in the way. I rate this movie 7/10 because of the moments it lacked and some bits were slow and did not have many jump scares.But it is just another 'found footage' film.,REC

Everyone who i have showed this film too has loved it including my dumber friends who i had to really persuade as they don't like foreign language films My hat goes off to the film-makers a dazzling unique horror that im sure Hollywood will ruin when 'Quarantine' comes out viva espana (or catalonia as the film is based in Barcelona)",REC
345,stevie-parmentier,A decent horror movie but I don't see the big deal about it.,5,21 December 2009,"Several people online recommended I watch this movie so it was with high hopes that I started watching. Yes, it was in Spanish, yes it was low budget, yes there aren't any famous actors, but it was great nonetheless - at least that's what they told me.I quite enjoy a decent zombie flick - 28 Days (and even Weeks) Later was fun to watch as was Dawn Of The Dead. Both movies managed to show some competence from people dealing with the undead: barricading themselves, protecting themselves, defending themselves among other things. Generally, you see people who survived showing why they survived. Survival of the fittest and all that.In (rec), you don't. You'd think the characters were all born without a brain: there's several apartments yet they remain in the hard-to-defend lobby instead of barricading themselves in. In fact, half the movie consists out of panicking, yelling, running and several people talking at once - a natural response you may say, but it makes the movie too hectic for my tastes.There's a reason most horror movies inject calm moments - to create contrast. The calm before the storm, letting characters reflect on what happened, to let the characters evolve beyond pure yelling and panicking. (rec) doesn't do that. Because of this, you don't learn anything about the characters. Heck, the story itself is pretty thin and barely explained.On the ""creepiness"" scale, it doesn't do that well either. This movie only made me jump twice and both using the same old trick: turn camera & reveal something that immediately attacks. Other times, the acting was too dire to be convincing. Not to mention you could predict what would happen half the time.The end result is a movie that is poorly paced, has average acting, little to no depth, clichéd sequences, dumb ass characters that seem to want to get bitten and a rather poor ending. It's not a terrible movie but it doesn't deserve the rating it's got right now IMHO.",REC

It's the directors choice to make the movie the way he wants it to be, filmed like a late night TV show for some Spanish/Catalan insomniacs that at that hour have nothing else to do then see a report about the performance of they're local Barcelona firemen rather then trying to attend a acting school or maybe a film director one. ( Don't understand me wrong, just trying to be a bit ironic, Spain has it's diamonds in this industry without doubt ).I could say the film started a bit more promising, the idea that from the beginning this movie is actually going to be a ""horror"" made me ""laugh"" in a hysteric way.The answer came pretty fast: a lack of inspiration i have never seen. The scene with the girl for example, too predictable to call it horror, could have been a Barbie Commercial or a anti-Barbie commercial ( * free to choose which one ). The ""so scary"" scene with the guy falling from the stares can be seen in American Pie or any other comedy or maybe in real life. The director should have thought twice about the movie he was going to make, it could have been pretty good but all the decisive parts in a any horror movie that should have been given more attention were mild and superficially worked on.I ""rec"" you: If you don't know Spanish fluently, don't use the subtitles, just watch it, {eventually on low level of volume so the hysterical annoying screams won't make you go mad and eventually receiving the saliva true the monitor ( just like the dog got it from 2 floors upstairs )} might be a bit more horror if you don't understand what they're talking.",REC

While I am someone who has a soft spot for found footage films, I say that on its own, this is just a phenomenal horror film, and the found footage aspect of it adds to the creepiness of it.

I don't mind it being a low budget movie, but there's nothing special in it's story and the picture shakes from the beginning to the end (since the amateur cameraman from the movie records the whole movie). I might say, that it's intense at some moments, but I'd still feel bad, if anybody took that as an recommendation; i.e. there's a scene with six people (two cops, two fire fighters and the camera crew) staring at a fat lady-zombie for a minute or two, just checking the zombie out, since it's well known for it's diplomatic behavior, and afterward, when it bites one cop, all but one fireman start running, and of course you run with them, since the camera guy's among the runners. While running, someone turns off the lights, finds the switch again, turns the lights back on and everybody starts running... Again. Just when you start thinking, that there's a fire fighter missing in the crew and that he might be roundhouse kicking the zombie, he comes flying down like a bag of sand.

First of all let me say this is one hell of a terrifying movie, i think i don't have to repeat the synopsis (several people already did that before me)...the story doesn't seem to be very original, we all have seen zombie movies before. But because of the claustrophobic setting this is totally different after all. It's a brilliant move to let it take place in an apartment building, with limited space. Also the first person way it's shot (which has done before as well) adds to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie. That and quite few great scares (which you really won't see coming from a mile away like a lot of (Hollywood) ""horror"" movies) and the great (and shocking) ending, makes this movies one of the best horror flicks i have ever seen.

357,wesselrieter,Horror at its best,8,4 February 2014,"REC. Being a horror fan is really not that easy. It takes a lot of effort finding a pearl among all those trashy films that are being produced which are primarily intended to scare the audience. A true horror consists of more than just the scare factor. It's also about creating empathy for the victim, building suspense and avoiding clichés. Coincidentally, REC meets all these requirements. This Spanish picture integrates found footage (shot with a camcorder for the sake of realism) with the zombie genre. The film is about a reporter named Manuela who covers a story about a group of firefighters in the heat of battle. At a given moment they get a call about an indoor fire in a nearby apartment and they decide to move out. When the firefighters enter the building, they are unaware of the actual dangers that are present among the inhabitants of the flat. Since it would be a sin to spill the beans, I won't go into detail about what they encounter. All I can say is that it involves zombies and that it escalates rather quickly. For those who enjoyed REC: there is good news and there is bad news. The good news is that there is a sequel (REC²) that basically tells the same story from another point of view and is definitely worth the watch. The bad news is that there is also a REC³, which is sadly more of a comedy than a horror..",REC

This is definitely 'Rank 1' on my horror movies list since may be 2006.I read some reviews for 'Rec' on the internet complaining about being based on the same old premise of complete chaos, a zombie-like infection, isolation, government cover-up etc. Movies need not necessarily have a never-seen-before storyline to be entertaining. What they need is a good plot, refreshingly new presentation, superb direction and convincing performances. 'Rec' scores 10 on 10 on all these parameters.The direction was guitar-string taut and brought out the absolute best from all the actors.'Rec' in the most simplistic expression is 'Blair Witch Project' marries '28 Days Later'. If you thought these two movies were great then 'Rec' betters both these.I saw 'Rec' alone in the night and this movie scared me real good. Many scenes were absolutely shocking and were shot in a very unique way. As the movie progresses you begin to wonder if this was actual footage that the director recovered and you begin to expect a disclaimer at the end that this was indeed a true story.I am a movie buff and I know making this movie was not easy. The camera work had to be natural and realistic and at the same time ensure that the viewers don't get irritated by the jerks and 'see-away' when the critical action is happening. The camera work in 'Rec' is brilliant it absolutely made you believe that this was actual footage and yet did not shy away from the main action and critical chilling moments.A completely new brand of horror!",REC

I would retreat in horror at her major fashion faux pas, or grab the nearest sharp object and beat the old biddie's brains in.2)Don't have children, they aren't just annoying and pointless but they will only wind up trying to chew your face off. Charming little darlings.3) Keep racist remarks to yourself because that comment about the Chinese lady will come back to bite you on the ass, quite literally.4) Those handcuffs you keep for those kinky times in the bedroom will come in handy when the neighbours are beating your door down to borrow some neck. I suggest using them before the growling starts.5) If you wake up in the morning with a slight lack of pulse and a husky throat, put it down to more than a rough night on the booze, and handcuff yourself to the bed frame. That is unless you dislike the neighbours, in which case, tuck in my friend.6) Make sure you call that Columbian girl back otherwise she's liable to give you more than a dose of cock-rot.7] Hang around with the gay dude - he's well spoken, rocks a sweater vest, always has a comb and will suggest a good escape route 20 minutes before the end. OK, so unfortunately it lead up to the neighbours who would get evicted for anti-social behaviour, but at least he tried goddamnit!8) Locking up the eating disordered in the attic will only lead to trouble. Yes she has an acquired taste and it's likely to be yours soon if you're not careful.9) Don't be an annoying smalltime news correspondent, that big news story will only eat you up in the end.10) So you finally meet that elusive attic neighbour who no-one has seen for years. Don't push a camera in their face, they are shy and have their own unique greeting that they have developed after such isolated times alone. Be polite and welcome their unusual customs, it'll only hurt for a second.11] Don't be shy, come out from behind the camera, they totally saw you spying on them with the night-vision, of course they're going to be peeved.

It contains so few actually brutal and bloody scenes that I was really surprised. Zombie films usually contain so much blood that it will surely lose it's reliability. Horror is made in the viewers head and small shots of cruel horror. THAT feels terrible. Or so you might think. Problem is that film is kinda boring. It gives nothing new and it's isn't even actually scary. I can't explain it any better. It WAS boring.

I started watching REC not really expecting too much, concerned that having to watch with subtitles may detract from the movie itself. I can say it does slightly (I had watched Quarantine first), but it is still better than most American horrors. The acting is amazing, as a viewer you really connect with the characters and what they are going through, and you try to imagine what you would do in the situation. This film works on a tension gradient, as it gets scarier and more intense all the way through, right up to the terrifying finale.

Somewhat similar to Blair Witch Project and maybe Cloverfield. But it works better here I would say.Some rather scary scenes are included which may make the more squeamish people jump out of their seats, but I think that is what horror movies are generally made for. As I said I didn't have any subtitles on so I missed most of the dialogue, so didn't really understand the plot in its entirety, cos my Spanish is pretty much limited to ordering a beer.

The two have been commissioned to follow around a team of Barcelona firemen for the night. Nothing much happens at first, just the two interviewing the men and touring the firehouse. Bored, Angela plays basketball with the firemen until the alarm goes off, and the loudspeaker says a person is trapped in their apartment. Angela, Pablo, and the two firemen they are following, Alex and Manu, arrive at a small apartment building and find some police already there.

The two firemen, two police officers, Angela and Pablo go upstairs to help her... and all hell breaks loose.

372,TechNoir1987,Just watch the last 10 minutes,4,21 February 2008,"to everybody who is thinking of watching this movie at the cinema. firstly check the film times at your cinema then pay to see a film that ends 10 minutes before the end of REC and enter this screening. do not pay to see this film its not worth it. The film is not original and is the start of the downfall of the handy cam genre. The film is really blurry and the camera is way to shaky for scenes that aren't needed. compared to the recent clover field this falls badly behind. the camera man in this hardly spoke in the film, which is odd seeing as hes trying to be eaten by zombies. there is a brief spell of a soundtrack that appears from no where at the end of the film which confused and angered me. the main zombie is brief but impressive, actual real tension is felt near the end of the film, which saved this movie from being mournful 3.5 to a woeful 4 out of 10.",REC

Honestly, I found it to be scare free and it just did not grab me at all, I found it quite tedious and it left very little impression on me other than disappointment. The acting is okay from memory, nothing much to write home about.By the way, that female monster zombie thing in the last scene made me roar with laughter the minute I saw it.

This joke of a film doesn't even deserve it, but oh well, there was nothing lower than that. Actually I was expecting more from this movie, it seemed interesting and had some good comments, but I was disappointed. After the first 30 mins I knew the only thing I would like about this movie was that it ended, so I watched it until the end. Low budget movies can't compete with SFX or decoration, so they have to rely on something else. REC had nothing of it. It wasn't original, even the idea of making it interesting by saying it was based on true events had been already used by Blair with. In fact, REC reminded me a lot of it. The first person camera bumps even when the camera men is walking on flat ground. And the acting... well, there was actually only the main character being filmed, who did nothing but scream hysterically from the beginning to the end. OK, you made your point. You're scared. Will you shut up already? Screams and bumpy camera. That's all this movie is about. Not worth even 1 star.",REC

This is a great genre film, where there are scares, blood, a little humor and a great ending. There are people who criticize this movie because it has no script, bad thing because this is not a movie, is a false story where you see what engraving, is not obliged to have to tell you anything.I didn't like some dialogs, for the rest is very well done.9-10 was a great movie",REC

Been a fan of this genre, I don't normally jump 5 feet off my seat when i see a scary scene. A thousand times better than any of the saw, 28, or resident evil movies. Many would say that it was a Blair Witch Project ripoff, but NO WAY IN HELL. The fact that one of the actor is a 7 year old girl who almost rip her mother's eyes out made me almost crap my pants. Another excellent point in this movie is the lack of elaborated scenery, Just a middle class building, with the just amount of people to create a frightening scene. My recommendation: See this movie alone, lights out, with a 5.1 audio system, so that no one hears you scream like a little girl. Well Done Spain, very well done!!!",REC

Even when finally a call comes in, it's a low priority call  tenants in a apartment building are complaining about screams coming from one of the apartments. So the police and the fire department are called in, and Niña and her cameraman, Pablo, decide to come along for the ride. When they arrive to the call, the neighbors have all congregated on the main level while the emergency staff  and the television crew  investigate upstairs and find an elderly woman in her apartment in a rabid state.

378,wafsj,Much more than a 28days Blair Witch lovechild,8,17 April 2008,"There's something about Spanish cinema these days, they just love scaring the crap out of us! People have likened this film to Blair Witch and 28days but i think it is much more than just a new twist. To start with the only similarity to Blair Witch is the hand-held cam. Personally i thought Blair Witch showed us how it could be done, Cloverfield showed us how it shouldn't be done but Rec. finally shows how it should be done. The balance is obviously between creating immediacy and drama without losing clarity or giving the viewer a headache. Some of the shots in Rec. are simply genius. You don't miss a thing; you never see too much or too little and even in the most hectic sequences it is clear time and effort has been taken to block the scenes. Original, innovative (considering the limitations of one camera) and above all scary. Whilst 'horror' is fairly simple to reproduce, this film honestly depicts 'terror'. The tension is at times unbearable and when we are made to jump its a while before heart rates slow down.As far as 28days goes, this is essentially a zombie film. I suppose what it borrows from 28days - but improves upon - is the realism. 'What you would ACTUALLY do in that situation' is what they actually do. The bickering, confusion, disbelief: its all believable. Its too well done to be ad libbed but too fluid to be scripted. Every new zombie film seems to try and put a new spin on zombies (make then run, speed up infection time etc.) and i think Rec.'s addition fits in perfectly.Overall this is a fantastic film. Everythin from Resident Evil to Rabid is brought together. It makes enough nods to pay homage but definitely brings enough new material to the table to avoid being clichéd. The short runtime is perhaps a shame, not because it detracted at all, but because i could watch this for hours on end! If you like your zombie/apocalypse/infected/horror stuff then get this now. Brilliant film.",REC

380,themgoroth,totally overrated!,4,7 June 2008,"I cannot understand how people can give this movie 8 stars or more and even say it's the scariest movie of all time. It is just a standard zombie movie with a shaky p.o.v gimmick. The best scares (if there are any) are completely predictable, as they've just been stolen from other major franchises (Grudge, Ring, Blair Witch, ...). The zombies themselves look very low budget (even for a low budget movie) and when they are screaming or running towards the camera you rather laugh than tremble in fear. Seriously when you have watched 28 Days Later or its successor, then there is nothing this movie can do for you. Another drawback are the major down times between the action or scare scenes that are just plain boring. I do not known why I could not sympathize with the people in the movie, maybe it was the bad synchronization (german) or the fact that there is just to many light and the whole scenery with people (cops, military or whatever) surrounding the house all the time (visible through the windows), shouting commands (why didn't the give em guns or whatever????) wasn't really scary in the first time. For my part I could not develop a feeling of hopelessness or being trapped with no escape. Rent the DVD if you have to but don't waste your money in the cinema you'll most likely will be disappointed.",REC

383,dapope251,American View On REC,9,24 September 2008,"So I am not one to post movie reviews online, but here goes.I have just seen the scariest movie of my life. It is disturbing in a way that bulldozes The Blair Witch Project. It is simply awe inspiring and truly horrific. The name of this movie? REC.I recently saw another preview for the movie Quarantine (in theaters October 10th) and got curious. I mean, I love The Blair Witch Project and I love Cloverfield, so this has to be worth seeing. So I decided to do some internet research and soon found out Quarantine is a remake to a 2007 Spanish film, REC. So I then found it has been released in the UK with English subtitles. Where to go from here? Straight to my favorite P2P to download the torrent. It finished downloading about 2 hours ago, and I watched it right away.The movie is in Spanish, but the torrent I found had subtitles and told you how to use them. Anyways, the movie starts out with a young news reporter who is assigned on duty at a Barcelona fire department. Soon they get a call and respond to an apartment where an elderly woman was heard screaming. As the police and firemen show up, they bust down the door and find the woman, covered in blood. As they approach her, she bites one of them. This is where the mayhem begins. And it goes straight through the next hour. The movie is short, only 75 minutes long, to be exact. But it keeps your heart pounding the whole time.This movie is a horror masterpiece. I won't give anymore details out, as it would spoil the surprises and suspense. But rest assured this is the scariest movie I have ever seen. The last 5 minutes leave you gasping and almost covering your eyes as the suspense builds and the tension mounts. The end is truly horrific and will probably fit in nicely with most of my nightmares.All in all, this is a fantastic movie with a fantastic cast, and is horrifying. You forget about it being in a different language 20 minutes in, and that carries you through the movie. I know most Americans won't check this out, so I leave you with a suggestion. When Quarantine comes out, go see it. If the producer knows what they're doing, they'll just do a direct script copy so Americans can enjoy it as much as the rest of the world already has. And if Quarantine sucks, wait until early 2009, when REC is released in American DVD. Hope you enjoy.",REC

True there is one Jumpy point, maybe two if you are particularly jumpy, but nowhere near the fright-fest i was expecting.Am hoping that the American re-make 'Quarantine' is actually going to be a first and be a major improvement on the original. Just my opinion but this film is not worth going to see if you are expecting to be scared.",REC

As someone who watches a lot of horror films, has it as his favourite genre of movie and wrote his dissertation on the genre I was overwhelmed by the greatness of this movie. As well as being highly scary, something a lot of modern horror films seem to have forgotten, it has a lot of new elements to it whilst still having lots of 'salutes' to other horror films i.e. the use of the old school tape player (The Evil Dead). The fact that the Americans are remaking it as Quarantine saddens me. Firstly how on earth are they going to improve it? I can see what is going to happen already, a glossy look film with unconvincing performances and the pace of the film ruined by an average director. Part of the fact that it is in Spanish makes it more convincing and believable, as the country is very Catholic and as such the idea of possession is a very real one. After I had watched the film my heart was still pounding for at least half an hour afterwards and my girlfriend was questioning as to why I would take her to go see such a film. The director does a fantastic job in pacing this film whilst also revealing different parts of the film at the correct times is almost that of a composer on top of his game. I would highly recommend that you see this film in the cinema or late at night on the best TV that you can. It will frighten you.",REC

I'll start off by saying that i am avid horror fan, i've seen all of the must-watch classics, reboots & even gone down the ""unsettling/disturbing"" rabbit hole. My expectations were absolutely shattered by this movie in the worst way possible. It was so incredibly underwhelming that my spouse, my father, and myself couldn't stop making jokes throughout the movie about how the scariest part of the entire thing was the main character's inability to stop screaming/yelling at everything. I wholeheartedly regret wasting my time watching this and am wondering if all of the positive reviews on here are part of some advertising ploy because this movie was Garbage with a capital G.The only thing positive i can say is that the storyline was original aside from the gaping plot hole that the dog somehow spread the infection even though the girl was said to have been isolated in the penthouse the entire time???",REC

391,firestormsnake,Good part was...I got my money back!,6,3 May 2008,"Well, I can't understand how people rate this as a masterpiece, because it's not. The good think was the machine in the theater I was watching the movie broke half way into the movie, so I did what I already had in mind doing, I left, and since the machine was broken I got my money. Well, I got a DVD so I just saw the rest and here goes my first review on IMDb =)First part, I like the camera technique, it's good, and it makes you feel more like you're actually there, but this guy probably is hooked on roofies. He shook that camera all the time, yes it's natural he shook it while running since he was scared and...Was running, but he still shook it too much, making the scenes excessively blurry at times. Second part, the sound, it annoyed me as hell, I think people were too close to the microphone at times, and the result, lots of loud screaming whenever they were arguing. Good point was the concept of the building, small, not much room to move around, it made the movie feel more ""claustrophobic"". Pity the movie doesn't allow you attach to the characters since they don't develop them enough.Now the movie itself, first part goes on with the annoying Angela (yes she is hysterical and annoying) covering the night in a Fire Department, along with her cameraman Pablo (who barely speaks the whole movie).The Fire Squad get's a call, there's an old lady who is stuck home and there they go. When in the apartment of the lady, there are 2 cops, 2 fire fighters and the news crew. OK it's predictable to us that the old lady will do something, after all she looks crazy and is covered in blood and this is a horror movie, maybe it isn't so predictable for the characters, but you never turn your back in these situations...one cop gets bitten and they take him downstairs, but isn't it stupid to let one fire fighter alone with her? Come on she attacked a cop with 6 people in the room...in the middle of all the damn noise at the lobby with the ones that came down, the other people who live in the building and the sanitary agents outside (who don't let anyone out), the fire fighter comes falling from up top, crashing on the floor.Moments later we see an innovative yet stupid element in the movie, the rewind part. Rewind as we all know is used while in playback and not recording...think a bit, and you'll know that I'm right.Jumping a bit forward (Watch the gay guy, he's funny - note I don't have anything against gay people), there's sanitary inspector inside, and the guys who got bitten, turn into zombies as well (did I see something like that in other, oh I don't know, a hundred movies...?). The inspector explains the virus. OK people turn violent, got that part, what I don't get is why the guy got in with no weapons to defend himself? Why the hell doesn't a tactical squad go in and clean the place? Sorry it's just stupid, they know the infected ones turn violent...Then another stupid moment, the little girl turns zombie and starts screaming like she wants the new Barbie real bad, yet the second cop still goes near her to give a shot with the syringe, and yes he got bitten...Chaos installs itself, as one by one, they get bitten and turn into zombies but I have to say I saw every scene, that was supposed to make me jump of the chair, coming, especially the upper part of the attic. By the way, who the hell is that kid?The end of the movie, that gives a ""better"" explanation for what happens, turns out to be just damn stupid. Let's see, Portuguese girl has virus (or is possessed whatever) and is locked in the attic with a boy on the upper part of it. They have been locked there for months and the virus (that passes through saliva) got to the dog that lives three floors below, that got to the little girl (who resists to it 1 whole day, while everyone else resisted no more than 30 minutes), that got the old lady that is always locked home, etc...The dog to the girl, OK the dog could lick the girl, dogs do that, but the rest, sorry, no logic. By the way, would you get near the girl in the attic? I don't think so...The movie had good chances, as it was kind of scary and it did left me tense, but the nonsense in it, screwed it...",REC

The way the movie is recorded, it looks difficult to know how it will be possible for the movie to go on. But it gets on, and better!

I'm not fazed by much but this got to me and I absolutely loved it. Not many movies achieve this level of psychological menace. From a technical aspect there are also some pretty impressive shot in this movie; at least 4 or 5 really long takes that must've taken some serious planning and choreography before it all fell into place.

The panic that comes from not being able to get away from a situation (a must in zombie films), the uncertainty of not knowing whats going on, the short and violent scares that come all of a sudden and make you jump, the longer ones that keep the pulse running,and the tour de force...that primal, instinctive fear that makes the hairs on your neck rise, and makes them stay up. Trust me, you will know what i'm talking about when it comes.I wish i could forget this movie, and see it for the first time again. Its effect is really that good.

At one point, I'd left my bedroom door open and thought I saw some shadows from outside in the living room.Anyway, the premise is somewhat original; a TV reporter decides to accompany a local firehouse on a call to an apartment complex in Spain after a pretty unassuming call for help from residents after hearing screams from an elderly woman's apartment. The movie is from the point of view of the television camera throughout. Upon arriving, the residents are obviously shaken up and quickly we start to gather that there is something definitely wrong the situation after the elderly resident who was heard screaming attacks a police officer with a bite on the neck. All hell breaks loose as people start to get injured and for some reason the authorities on the outside will not let remaining residents leave or allow the injured officers and fireman to get help. As the movie progress, more casualties occur, the plot thickens, and we start to understand what is going on and the horrific scope of the events.I've watched several movies that are subtitled, from an American point-of-view, and unlike most Americans, and having some extended knowledge of Spanish the dialogue was easy to follow and I felt as if I were watching any American movie.Overall, throughout the movie and to the ending with an its incredible climax, I was scared, I'll admit...and rightfully so.James I hear that there is an American version being made.

Heck, why not? I was in for a big surprise. He, also. Talk about assumption being the mother of all f-ups.I won't write anything, as summary and praises were already written n times, but this movie is the scariest movie I've seen this year. Probably even in the last few. I hadn't had troubles sleeping because of a movie for a lot of years, but last night I didn't get much sleep.REC is tense, scary and you should definitively see it.

But I didn't expect that kind of film from this country (Spain). This movie shows that you don't have to make some extraordinary special effects or computer made monsters to get a good horror movie. Small number of cast member, small area of action (a building), but because the way of filming (just like in Blair Witch Project or Project Cloverfield), original sound (only from the personal camera),the action you encounter here and the way you just think you're inside this movie makes this it a kind of movie you shouldn't watch alone at night ;) I give a perfect 10...

405,Darillian,I am pretty disappointed...,5,13 May 2008,"I have to admit that despite of all those very good comments I was heavily disappointed by the movie...Although many people claim this being one of the most frightening pictures they've ever seen, in my opinion this is clearly not the case!There were exactly three moments where I was seriously shocked: The moment where Jennifer dashed towards the police officer, the part where the hatch to the top floor sprung open and the moment where the infected boy appeared on the camera right after.The final scene wasn't even that bad, I liked the appearance of the monster, but nonetheless huge parts of the plot were obvious and predictable.I wouldn't go so far to call the screenplay pathetic, but the characters were flat in the best, poor in the worst case...So all in all, this movie receives 5 points: Three for the three mentioned moments I really felt adrenaline flooding through me, one for the end and one for the moments I had to laugh quite hard at the low-level acting delivered by the cast.",REC

The way it's filmed is a huge plus, you really get caught up in the moment of the movie, it makes it feel so much more realistic not to mention the whole virus thing instead of some supernatural thing, simply awesome.Even though it's quite a scary movie, it has some nice side jokes that gives you quite a nice laugh, I fooled my friend who hate horror movies since he is so easily frightened and even he laughed at some points. But even though there are places in the movie where you laugh, that ""nice"" feeling that something is about to happen doesn't go away, in fact those side jokes might make the next scene even more scary since you'll be even more surprised.This is the first movie to have actually frightened me in like 6 years so I have to say this is one of my favorite movies at the moment. I've seen it twice and I still get frightened at this one spot even though I knew it was going to happen.I give this movie a 9 / 10.",REC

408,ivanaxivana,Obnoxiously hysterical,2,17 April 2008,"I was so incredibly disappointed with this film! The plot synopsis was good, the concept was interesting and the acting was good. The directing, however, was desperately lacking in timing and creativity. Every good horror movie embodies a certain amount of tension, the dynamics of which slowly raise to those ultimate scary, shocking moments that make you jump out of your seat, after which it falls again, so it can catch the audience by surprise all over again. rec however had a simplistic and tedious dynamic. The first half hour of the film presented the predictable, overly-mundane introduction you find in most horror movies. This then rapidly escalated into mass-hysteria which dominated the rest of the film. Every character in the entire movie was screaming, hyperventilating and panicking throughout the entire film. At no point could any of the characters calm down or stop shouting, creating unsympathetic and completely obnoxious characters. The only gratifying part about this movie was when a pathetic screaming bundle of nerves would get put out of their misery. And even this wasn't particularly gratifying.

412,rieflin,Derivative & clichéd,2,16 May 2008,"I had high hopes for REC. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I loved Iglesia's 'El Dia de la Bestia' (which, admittedly, is more comedy than horror), and so I hoped that Balaguero and his co-writer/director might give a uniquely ""Spanish"" take to a zombie movie.What a disappointment. REC is a compendium of horror clichés. The situation of Night Of the Living Dead (people trapped, in this case, in an apartment block); the zombies of '28 Days/Weeks Later' - they run; they are victims of a virus; they are incredibly aggressive and strong; their look, including the red eyes are all lifted straight from the '28 Days/Weeks' franchise; and the shooting style mimics Blair Witch/Cloverfield/Diary Of The Dead.' Added to this, there's almost no sense of character or attempt to establish who the characters are. We never get to know or care about any of them. For that reason, I have to disagree with the people who found this scary. I didn't, simply because I didn't care about anyone. Indeed, I found most of the scares laughable.Two other criticisms; first, the story and pacing badly lacks dynamics. After a slow opening - which I actually found the most entertaining part of the movie, purely because it was the only part with any sense of character - the director throws the switch to overdrive. The pace and shooting style ensure the next hour is almost non-stop chaos. This doesn't work. To mis-use a Spinal Tap analogy, if the amps are already at eleven, where do you go from there? Nowhere. REC has the same problem - the amps go to eleven very quickly and stay there. There's no sense of build, no sense of tension and release. It's just all out-full throttle anarchy. It palls very quickly, and becomes tiresome and repetitive. The other criticism is about logic. With zombies running round and jumping out of the shadows trying to kill you at every opportunity, would any cameraman seriously keep filming? Would they really run around with one eye glued to the viewfinder, instead of keeping BOTH eyes peeled for zombies? I wouldn't. But this cameraman's a real trooper. He keeps filming, no matter what. I didn't believe it for one second, which is a real problem for a shooting style that is designed to tell an audience that ""This is real."" But, if the cameraman stops filming, you don't have a movie, because we never cut away from what the camera records.I wish I could be more positive, but I can't. I thought it was a ham-fisted, derivative, clichéd mess. But I'm nearly fifty. Maybe I'm getting old. I hope others enjoy it more than I did.",REC
413,john-dunmore,Rec/ Spanish Horror films 'stepping up' Their Genre,9,12 August 2008,"This Film is a superior horror film to The Spanish film the Orphanage, it begins with a clever slightly 'Wacky' Look into the after dark workings of the local Barcelona Fire service. The film attempts to build the characters prior to the main body of the film, which allows us to experience 'emphathy' with individuals before the core action begins.This may have benefited with a slightly longer study of the players as this would have heightened the action, however suffice to say the film does not suffer as a result of schlock horror frenzied bullet paced action that follows.My thoughts are that the length of the film will go some way to creating a 'cult' status among the people who enjoy pushing there tolerance to the limit.",REC

I don't think the storyline was any good as we only got about 2 minutes of what was happening inside the building.

The film is full of creepy scenes that sometimes are a bit predictable but that doesn't stop you from jumping out of you sit.Some mistakes, and kinda poor light management but i thing it goes along with the cheap late night program that is supposed to be filming the normal fireman night.

A lot of comments say, that this is one of the best movies in the genre of Horror but it isn't! It's highly overrated! I watched ""Rec"" at night, and i wasn't frightened at all. The story is simple and the atmosphere isn't that scary at all. The actors do their best to increase the atmosphere but it doesn't work at all. Don't trust all the ""the tube"" videos which show the reactions of people watching ""rec"" because it must be fake. Rec isn't scary at all. Rec is okay, but it isn't an instant classic or whatever! Better watch Dawn of the Dead instead or Evil dead if you want to see a good Horror picture!",REC
418,Erica_Lee,"Too much hype, too little substance",3,10 September 2008,"I don't understand why this movie is so overrated in IMDb and other sites. Some posters even say this is the scariest movie of all times. In my opinion, they get scared too easily and they have watched too few horror films. Try some Japanese horror films and see the real stuff.From my vantage point, REC is just a mediocre zombie flick that cannot live up to its hype. This film is a rip-off of many zombie movies (28 days/weeks later, resident evil, night of living dead, you name it) without offering anything new to chew on. The whole plot is so threadbare and utterly predictable that the film is not scary or tense at all in my opinion. I did not experience any seat-jumping or nerve-shredding moments. I found myself just glued to the back of my seat stone-faced like a zombie. Tempo was bad in the first half as the the film built up the plot, character and supposedly tension. But things didn't really move into gear when the breakout kicked off in the second half. The second half was mostly noisy commotion and running around, with Angela narrating hyper actively. The ensuing shaky cam shots really made me dizzy. I can't understand why the running crowd never grabbed a weapon to protect themselves. Plot holes like this are not in short supply. Those so-called ""scary"" scenes such as zombies suddenly jumped out with ferocious speed and bit people, apartment dwellers fell off the building and dropped like a rock, Angela found the right key in the nick of time to escape from the zombies, are all too formulaic and familiar. The fat old lady running in her undies biting people is nauseating rather than creepy. Some of the zombie interludes just got too contrived and absurd. For example, when the dwellers found 8-yr old Jennifer standing in the dark staring grotesquely at them after she killed her mom, why would they be so stupid to try to fondle her, only to get bitten? In another occasion, the apartment manager locked up the virus inspector behind the iron gate and then talked about his evacuation plan with Angela. It is so stupid that he stood so close to the gate while talking and predictably, he ended up being attacked by the inspector via the gate after the latter turned into a zombie. It seems the director simply set up terrifying shots haphazardly just for the sake of terrifying, without using logic. Such interludes are not chilling or convincing. The only mild saving grace is that the final 10 minutes were somewhat suspenseful and the freak in the penthouse was really disturbing. But the night vision scene reminded me of the ""Silence of the lambs"", so nothing original there. Also, the ending was so lame that i am sure even pumpers of this movie would find it a turn-off.Apart from the cookie cutter gore, there are other things i feel need to be ranted about. The script is banal and clichéd. Dialogue is trite. Character development is non-existent. Music and special effects are uninspiring. I realize that it is a low budget movie, but so is SAW which outperforms REC in virtually every aspect and by a wide margin.I am amazed how such a poorly executed movie received one-sided raving reviews in IMDb . Maybe it has been too long after ""28 days later"" and the Western world is so starved for another zombie flick that everyone just jumped on the REC bandwagon. Or maybe, some posters are paid to hype up this thing in internet. Other pumpers may have their vested interests to look after. This is a very important movie for the Spanish and the US remake is on the way. So go figure.",REC

The only difference is the details of the end, which I will not spoil here.The actors are much more annoying than those in Quarantine. Not because they speak Spanish, many foreign horrors prove to be very scary. But because all they do is shout at each other! Particularly the female TV presenter, all she does is scream! All in all though, it is a pretty decent watch. Well, I'm about to watch REC2 so they must have done something right :)",REC
422,dacool_man,"Excellent movie... Why to do an ""adaptation""?",9,10 January 2009,"I will not write an extended review, mainly because isn't need to say ""it's and excellent movie"" it's like reinvent the wheel. But, I want to add some comments: First: some people judge the movie by only the first 5-6 minutes. Obviously, the intention was to show an annoying TV program (it's so annoying... ""When You Asleep"" sounds like a rookie's TV show aired at 3-4 AM), with annoying characters, showing annoying scenarios.Second: why the racist comments and theme? It's a fact not known for many people outside Spain, but the Spaniards (mainly in big cities like Madrid, Barcelona, etc) tends to be VERY racist, moreover if the people doesn't look like a Spaniard. You can feel that, just look at the people's faces, when anyone makes any comment about the Colombian girl (her face isn't even shown in the whole movie) or the Japanese guys (isn't even clear is the're from China or Japan, these people doesn't even know that). But, for example, César, the narcissist old man, their accent makes evident the fact is from Argentina. It's not a secret that Argentina is the ""preferred daughter"" of Spain among the countries in Latin America. Indeed, not only Cesar isn't segregated, but, himself, is racist too! In fact, at the middle of the movie, the most racist women (their pet and their daughter) was the vector of the disease. As you can see, it's just a critic to the racism in Spain.Third: I cannot understand why Filmax sold the rights to make an ""adaptation"" for Hollywood. WHY? It's because the US people don't like to read subtitles? What a shame! It's not fair, because it's a GOOD MOVIE and I think the Hollywood makers underestimate the US viewers. For example, here in Venezuela we made a movie called ""Secuestro Express"", a very good movie. The movie was screened with subtitles and received many good critics. Then, why to do an adaptation? There is already two cases, and the adaptation was VERY BAD. And I think this is not the exception to rule...",REC

Being a fan of Cloverfield, I was all ""f**k yeah"" about seeing REC. I gotta say, I was disappointed.I *could* have been a really good movie if it weren't for two things: too damn predictable and the acting sort of fell apart doing the most intense scenes. This movie is a B movie at best. If I had known that going into it, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more as I would have come prepared with a lot of pot and possibly could have had a few chuckles.I mean, come on... if the only thing protecting you from a zombie (and don't get on my case for using the 'zed' word, for all intents an purposes, this is a zombie flick) is a flimsy gate with glass panes, why in the hell would you choose to stand in front of it while explaining a plot device? It's stupid. It's also not very convincing when the actor's movements are so obviously deliberate as to place himself in the middle of danger so we get the cheap thrill of watching him get his sh*t wrecked.I'm sick of horror movies were the characters actions are so deliberately retarded because the writer couldn't find another way to advance the story.

I expected a lot of this movie, the IMDb rating, the comments and my roommate all pointed to the fact that this was one hell of a scary movie.To give you an idea I jumped perhaps 3-4 times and laughed my ass off at other moments. But you have to know I really tried. I watched it at 2 a.m. in a dark room with just the movie playing and the sound turned way up. It didn't work. At first its kind of creepy but when you find out its just zombies the entire thing was gone. I really have a hard time understanding people who say this is the scariest movie ever.At one moment a little girl turns zombie and i just couldn't stop laughing it was hilarious. The end might frighten you a little but its all over to soon. I recommend you see this movie with friends and a couple bottles of beer and have a good laugh at least you will enjoy yourself.",REC
433,danovbge,The Spanish know how it's done!,8,2 February 2012,"This is a not your average hand-held camera film, such as paranormal activity, this is how a low budget hand-held camera film should be done. My advice is, watch 'REC' before you watch the likes of 'Quarantine' and 'The Blair Witch Project' (don't get me wrong there still good films), but this REC is far better and actually has an entertaining and unravelling storyline keeping you engaged. However don't listen to all the reviews talking about how it's the 'scariest movie going', trust me it's really not, the jumps are not that dramatic and the actual setting is not all that 'scary'. Yet it's truly worth watching!",REC

Brought it home and was so excited to watch a horror movie because I am such a horror movie fanatic.The first 10 or so minutes of the movie were just dreadful. I could already tell it was low budget, and the acting was just atrocious. I have only taken about 4 years of acting classes and I knew I could have done way better than that. The best part was the entire movie was in Spanish (which was not written anywhere on the box that we got from the kiosk). It literally was just the word ""REC."" with a red dot beside it. Really? I paid a dollar for THAT?We ended up finally turning the translations on but that didn't make the dialogue -or lack-thereof- any better at all. The movie was far from ""scary"" to be honest. And yes, a sixteen year old girl was not scared by the movie, just annoyed and irritated buy the terrible acting and lack of originality put into it.This was probably one of the worst movies I had ever seen. Although, I guess it's not as bad as the movie Open Water.",REC

436,simonlister73,Superior Spanish Horror. Magnifico!,8,17 September 2012,"Rec might have a low budget, but it uses that to its advantage. Shot in a first-person, hand-held style, a lot of the action takes place just at the edge of your vision, which makes it even more effective (compare the falling down the stairwell scene to the American remake and you'll see what I mean). And action there certainly is. The first few minutes set up the premise for the film, then BANG! It's relentless from here on in. Superficially, Rec is a zombie film, but it's much more than that. If you want to jump out of your skin, hang on the edge of your seat and be scared out of your wits, I can't think of many better films. The 'Spoiler' alert is because I'm about to tell you that the last minutes introduce an unnecessary supernatural element that feels clumsy and tacked-on. It almost - almost - ruined it for me, which is also the reason that I didn't give the film 10/10. Don't let it put you off, the film is brilliant.",REC
437,tjaykillorn,Maybe the best horror film i have ever seen,8,10 April 2013,"I have to say this film right here is one of the best horror movies i have ever seen in my life, although it being only 16 years. Not to forget that i am a lover of a shaky camera - found footage film.Rec was released in 2007 and co-written and directed by Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza. I have to say, they done a wonderful job. What helped Rec have a terrifying atmosphere was the first person perspective used with the shaky camera style. Watching this horror made me feel as if i was walking with Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) and Pablo (Pablo Rosso) every step of their horrific supernatural journey. Another thing that makes Rec evermore terrifying is the fact that it is a foreign made film, a Spanish one. Knowing that the actors were not speaking my language made the atmosphere that little more eerie.This atmosphere kept me in suspense throughout the entire film and that is just one of the of the reasons that Rec is one of my favourite horror films. I highly recommend you watch the other 2 films in the Rec franchise and look out for the new addition that should be out sometime this year.",REC

First I taught it was kinda boring because it was filmed by a camera , like a lot of movies, but later it was so awesome. The style of the movie is never done before (as far as I know) the ''things'' aren't really zombies because it's spread by a virus. Every movie of the rec movies reveal something about the ''things'' in the movies. In the first one it is more about the virus, in the second one they look more like demons and in the third one they really look like zombies.I already saw them all and I think the first one was the best. I really recommend this movie to all the horror lovers.",REC

441,olga-budisin,Type of a horror that lacks an interesting story. A question of survival.,3,10 November 2014,"If you are looking for the type of horror that has a smart story, keep looking further. This is a classical horror, with a great prologue, and nothing more. The prologue is realistic, and ghastly. However the rest of the movie is paranormal with a poor story. The idea of the film is original, and interesting. As it is already written above in the IMDBs' main review: it's a film where a television reporter with her cameraman makes a TV report of firefighters' usual evening. What made me watch the movie, is a brilliant idea of playing this movie on a usual TV channel. When I changed the channels as usual on my TV, I stopped for a moment to see what's going on... As I joined the movie at it's beginning, at first I thought it wasn't the move, but a report - and that is the perfect idea of the movie. The very convincing act of making a TV report, where a spectator feels like he's watching some kind of a reality show, not a movie. As the movie goes on, the story becomes as it is expected to be... Poor and superficial - typical for low-rated horror movies. This horror is not about interesting story. It's about the question of survival.",REC

I seriously do.,2,1 February 2014,"After watching Paranormal Activity 1 to 3 and having Blair Witch Project in fairly good memory I was looking for similar first-person- horror movies. I was pretty surprised to see a non-Hollywood horror flick being rated as good as this one, so I decided to give it a shot. Now I can confirm about every single negative comment on this movie. After about half an hour I was seriously looking for the end. That joke of a plot is predictable, full of logic flaws, there's no tension at all as the action is based on well-known clichés and predictable shock moments. The characters behave completely illogical and annoy the hell out of you with their permanent hysterical screaming. The worst is the main character though. The character is completely unrealistic and just kills off every scary aspect by annoying you all over and over again. After relying on IMDb for several years now, I have to say that it's the first time I get so disappointed that I've decided to write a review. The second star is only in case that I might be too p***ed off right now to write a more objective one.",REC

I hope that people read this review before they go and watch this movie based on the high-rated reviews. To the people that gave ""REC"" 8-10 starswhat were you thinking?? One of the scariest movies you've seen? You couldn't sleep for days, you say?? I feel sorry for you. Just as I feel sorry for myself for wasting 75 minutes of my life watching this garbage.I truly had high expectations, and the reviewers who gave me false hope really dropped the ball on this one. I just can't stress enough how un-scary this movie is. I did jump once at the beginning of the film. Halfway through when the action started to pick up a little, I was quite literally laughing out loud at parts that were supposed to be scary but were actually hilarious. If you are faint of heart or an 8-year-old, then by all means, watch ""REC"" to get your thrills. If not, find a real scary movie and let me know what it is, because I'm still on the hunt.",REC
444,vicente_rr,Insufferable hack Balagueró delivers yet another crap fest,2,28 January 2008,"Stay away from this film. Easily the worst movie (horror or otherwise) I've seen in the last three years: long (even at a meagre 70 min), boring, predictable, overacted, and incredibly stupid. The mildly interesting setup never rises above the film's hackneyed storyline. All characters, without exception, are so annoying as to prevent any passing feeling of identification from the viewer; many of the performances, as well as the dialogue, try too hard to be naturalistic and end up coming across as awkward and affected. I lost all interest in what was going on halfway through, and the movie's feeble attempt to pick it up during the last 10 minutes fell flat; I just wanted it to end. I had read some praise for this film at the time of the Sitges Festival, so I was somewhat intrigued, but I should have known better, having watched two of Balagueró's previous offers (Los sin nombre and Darkness). Those were painfully mediocre at best, this one is insultingly dreadful.",REC

You've got to be kidding !!!,8,3 April 2008,"I have never written an IMDb review before, but in light of the last few comments and 1 star ratings that some reviewers have bogglingly decided to award this truly scary horror movie I feel that I need to.I won't go into any details about the plot as you can obviously find them in the synopsis or many other user comments. But I will say that this film is a roaring success, far better than the similarly shot Blair Witch Project. To me at least, the characters seemed believable (possibly a little one dimensional but what more do you need for a short scare fest ?). The SFX are excellent, the zombies being horribly monstrous and the gore splattering convincingly across the screen. The feeling of claustrophobia and terror is in place, and there were more than a few times that I jumped in my seat.All in all, one of the best horror films I have seen in a long time.

Not that it will make you afraid of the dark or it will make you question your vision of life, but parts of it will stay with you. This is the kind of movie that is all about the experience, the feelings you experience while inside it, the atmosphere. This is the kind of movie you wish you hadn't seen because then you'd be able to experience it again for the first time.It doesn't have amazing dialogues, it doesn't have a compelling story, but still is one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in my life. It's a short movie, short enough to have you interested all along, and everything is well packed, the pace being almost perfect. It goes from a quiet, even boring documentary from a cheap local TV to an atmosphere full of tension and expectation. Truly a unique experience. It has some flaws but the movie as a whole made me forgive them all.",REC

448,Switch999,Takes horror to a new level.,9,30 May 2008,"I walked into this film knowing nothing other than it was a horror, and shot from a cameraman's perspective. Generally, horror films to me are either over the top gore fests or painfully boring attempts at psychological horror.Ten minutes into the film, nothing had happened. I almost walked out. Whatever it was that persuaded me to stay, I thank it.This film had me, and everyone else, literally on the edge of our seats. I have never before been so terrified. In your bog standard horror, it is usually apparent when something is going to 'jump' out at you, but in REC, you can be expecting a fright for a long time. It may never come.The build up of tension is so powerful, and i'm gutted I didn't get to watch it in a packed cinema, as the 20 or so people in there made the tension thick enough to cut. Then, when everything is nice and calm you get a good smack in the face to remind you that REC is there to scare you to death.The ending is a little lacking plot-wise, but is executed so masterfully it can be excused. It's a pity most people didn't see it whilst I was there, as they were too busy hiding their eyes. It really is that terrifying.Overall, I find it hard to criticise this film. The long, drawn out beginning is completely justified, the fact that it was all in Spanish made the scenarios more panic-stricken (as I had to read subs and couldn't hear what people were saying in the background - really added to the film), and Manuela Velasco's performance is stunning.See this film.",REC

I'm amazed this film manages to pack so much anxiety,tension and intensity in in less the 80 minutes.
No lie, my jaw was dropped by the end.
Unlike other found footage movies it makes since that they countinuing to film because they are news journalists and are doing their job.
They make you feel like it's a necessity to continue to record what's going on and i feel the found footage style adds to the chaos of the situation.
The fast pace and abrubt cutting elevates the scariness in that it adds to the unpredictability of what's to come scene by scene.
If I had to complain about anything some scenes in the middle drag down the pacing for me but overall this is a minor complaint.
Excellent horror film.",REC

A movie hasn't thrilled and scared me so much for a long time, and I'm a hardened zombie fan. Quick description 'Blair Witch on Crack' I really don't want to give anything away, it starts off nice and sedately but once the action starts its a full on adrenaline gore fest with jumps really when you least expect them right to the very end. It doesn't let up for a second and I was glued to the screen for every second, I dare not look away. The photography is shaky at times, but the whole thing is really well put together. I understand it was low budget but that does not alter the realistic nature of the special effects, but more importantly the overall feel of the movie isn't jeopardised at all.

I watched it last night with my girlfriend and although I was somehow familiar from the reviews about the way the movie is shot and all, I didn't say nothing to my girlfriend, who, at one point asked me if this is a true event caught on tape as it happened or it's a work of fiction...with every scene passing by, some of my imagination started to ask the same thing because the way in which this movie it shot, the way the actors react and speak, the gravity of the situation and the tension escalating with every second's pass really makes your heart beat faster as if you're there with the people and sharing their fear, their lack of orientation and the fight for survival...not for a moment I was bored and there are scenes at which I found myself jumping because, unlike other horror flicks, here there are shocking events happening when you least expect them, and THAT for me, makes a TRUE horror movie...All in all, I started watching this movie by putting it to the bottom of my personal horror movie classification, and by the time it finished, it climbed up to the top with high-paced, adrenalin-filled steps, way better that any other movie of this genre I have ever seen so far! 10 out of 10!",REC

They respond to a routine call at an apartment building. The first 30 minutes of the movie drug a little while the fire department and the tenants of the apartment building try to figure out what is going on. Once they do, all hell breaks loose. The entire movie is shot from the point of view of the TV cameraman and the cinematography is very gritty and realistic. If you are a horror fan like me, I think you will come to the same conclusion that I did - This movie delivered the goods! I am glad I watched this in the daytime.

Yes it was inventive but there was only actually about 10 minutes of gore/scariness which doesn't make a great movie in my book. I did get completely fed up and started fidgeting not even half way through, i was that bored. I think the problem is that it has been built up to something bigger and better then what it is. Think Blair Witch on Nytol. The best bit was the end of the film about the last fifteen minutes when there seemed to be more action and suspense then the whole film.If you were expecting something amazingly gory/ scary/ new don't watch this because its an awful predictable film.Guess we'll have to wait for the Americans to ruin it even more.",REC
455,aikidemon,More than the generic rehash of a zombie flick,8,16 January 2009,"After having been turned off to Quarantine for its poor reviews I decided to see if the original would have something more to offer. I was pleasantly surprised as REC offers something more than the generic rehash of a zombie flick. The biggest angle on this movie is its first person, home movie style which some may find disorienting or distracting. But if you allow yourself to become acclimated to it, this visual style serves the movie very well especially considering the close quarters in which most of the movie takes places. More than once I found myself twisting and turning in the hopes of glimpsing something that seemed just beyond the field of view of the camera, a surely intended effect. The imagery during the final moments of the movie was truly unnerving. Kudos to Rasso. Beyond the terrific cinematography, the story line and importantly the characters were developed quite nicely. Despite its short run time, the movie builds up the characters' personalities such that you are either rooting for someone to survive or hoping they get what is coming to them. But there is no lax in acting or direction allowing for apathy from the audience. If you enjoy zombie movies as a genre I think you will agree this is a pleasant addition. I give this movie an 8 only because I would loved to have had more to see.",REC

The only two movies that scared me a little bit were "" The Shining"" and ""The Others"". Rec is a short, greatly acted, well done and creepy as hell film. The length is only of 75 minutes but is paced very fast. For me it has one of the best endings I have ever seen. I am Portuguese so for the ones that have seen the movie, they know that it must have a special something for me. The actors are unknown but very talented, we can see the fear in their eyes, I don't know the budget for this movie but certainly wasn't much, and the special effects are very nicely done, the gore is realistic. Although this is a Zombie flick, it makes perfect sense, there aren't any unrealistic facts and the director works hard to give us the hints to some questions we ask about the story. There are scenes that for me will remain in the horror movies history for a long time, especially the last one,( those who watched it know...). All in all this is a must see horror film even for those who hate the genre. 10/10",REC
