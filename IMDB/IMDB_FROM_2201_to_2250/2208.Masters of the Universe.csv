0,Leofwine_draca,"Cheesy, dated, fun",6,29 August 2019,"MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE is a typical slice of cheese from Cannon, the studio who made the 1980s synonmous with over-the-top action vehicles filled to the brim with SFX spectacle. It's the movie version of the popular '80s cartoon series, and brawny Dolph Lundgren is well chosen to play the taciturn hero. The rest is a mix of genre tropes, looking and feeling like those Lou Ferrigno HERCULES pictures at times, and elsewhere like a mix between FLASH GORDON and STAR WARS.The action is dated and small scale, mainly consisting of laser gun battles and Dolph swinging his sword around to fell henchmen. Meg Foster makes for an excellent Evil-Lyn and Frank Langella is certainly hamming up a storm as Skeletor, although I think his rubber mask looks more than cheap and a hard skeletal structure would have been far more convincing. The rest is a mix of rubber suited monsters, bad dialogue and a perky Courtney Cox doing her thing. Hardly a classic, then, but if you like '80s cheese you'll be in your element.",Masters of the Universe
1,SnoopyStyle,almost good enough cheese,5,5 August 2013,Skeletor conquers Castle Grayskull. He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) and his friends escape with the help of the Cosmic Key. They land on earth but the Key goes missing. Teens Julie Winston (Courteney Cox) and her boyfriend Kevin Corrigan find the Key but are unable to understand it. Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster) tracks the Key with her minions.To say that this is cheesy is to say the Pope is catholic. This is a live action movie based on the cartoon. It has cheesy FX. It has cheesy character costumes. It has cheesy acting from Dolph Lundgren. Yep the cheese is all over this thing. This certainly have its moments. It has some fun both intentional and unintentional. It's also noteworthy to see a younger Courteney Cox. I don't think it's quite cult classic or campy fun.,Masters of the Universe
2,claudio_carvalho,Silly but Entertaining,5,18 June 2017,"On the planet Eternia, Skeletor (Frank Langella) and his dark army overthrow the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull (Christina Pickles) expecting to acquire her power. He-Man (Dolph Lundgren), his old friend Duncan ""Man-at-Arms"" (Jon Cypher) and his daughter Teela (Chelsea Field) are attacked by Skeletor's soldiers and they defeat them. They also rescue their prisoner, the inventor and locksmith Gwildor (Billy Barty). He explains that he was lured by Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster) that used his invention Cosmic Key to open the gates and seize the Castle Grayskull. He-Man and his friends retrieve the prototype of the Cosmic Key trying to release the Sorcereress but they are defeated by Skeletor and his army and Gwildor uses his key to open and portal for them to flee. They come to Earth but lose the key. Meanwhile Julie Winston (Courteney Cox), who grieves the loss of her parents in a plane crash, and her boyfriend Kevin Corrigan (Robert Duncan McNeill) find and activate the key, believing it is a foreign musical instrument. On Eternia, Evil-Lyn locates the Cosmic Key and Skeletor sends her with a group of mercenaries and soldiers to vanquish He-man and his friends and bring the key back. Will they succeed?""Masters of the Universe"" is a silly but entertaining fantasy adventure film. The movie is a ripoff Star Wars, with the introductory credits rolling on the screen, the score and Skeletor's army, and Conan, with the strong Dolph Lundgren. The plot has silly moments, like Julie delivering the Key to her deceased mother or the comic attitudes of Detective Lubic. But ""Masters of the Universe"" is cult and entertaining for the fans. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Mestres do Universo – O Filme"" (""Masters of the Universe – The Movie"")",Masters of the Universe
3,gavin6942,A Strange Little Film,6,13 November 2015,"A prince turned warrior named He-Man battles against the dark lord Skeletor on the planet Eternia. He-Man and his comrades arrive on Earth and discover two teenage lovers to find the magical Cosmic Key.Now, the strange thing about this is that the film was in production based on the toys and not on the cartoon. This results in two very different visions of the same characters, and probably results in plenty of confusion from those who expect the cartoon and get something with lasers and Courteney Cox.But taken in its own right, it is not bad. Not great, but not bad. And it certainly is better than what they tried to do with the Super Mario Brothers. (Although, even that one is fun now that we can look back and laugh.)",Masters of the Universe
4,jboothmillard,Masters of the Universe,3,6 May 2019,"I remember watching a cartoon version of He-Man (maybe the 1990s one) when I was a kid, it all started with the toys from Mattel, there was the classic 1980s cartoon, there was the comic books, and so came the live-action movie big screen version of the cartoon, which I knew was regarded terribly by fans and critics. Basically on the planet Eternia, at the centre of the Universe, Castle Grayskull has been seized by the evil Skeletor (Frank Langella) and his army, scatters the remaining Eternian defenders, and captures the Sorceress of Grayskull (Friends' Christina Pickles). The mighty warrior He-Man (Dolph Lundgren), the most powerful man in the universe, is ready to overthrow Skeletor, his archenemy, along with his old friend Duncan ""Man-at-Arms"" (Jon Cypher) and his daughter Teela (Chelsea Field). Gwildor (Razzie nominated Billy Barty), a Thenorian locksmith, is rescued by He-Man, he reveals that Skeletor has acquired his invention: a ""Cosmic Key"" that can open a portal to anywhere in the universe. The device was stolen by Skeletor's second-in-command, Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster), allowing Skeletor to breach Castle Grayskull. Using Gwildor's remaining prototype of the Key, He-Man and his friends attempt to free the Sorceress, but Skeletor's army overthrows them, forcing them to flee through a portal. They are transported to modern-day New Jersey, planet Earth, but the Key is misplaced on their arrival and discovered by teenager Kevin Corrigan (Star Trek: Voyager's Robert Duncan McNeill) and his orphaned girlfriend Julie Winston (Courteney Cox). The pair attempt to figure out what the Key is and accidentally send a signal that allows Evil-Lyn to track the Key and send her henchmen - Saurod (Pons Maar), Blade (Anthony De Longis), Beast Man (Tony Carroll) and Karg (Robert Towers) - to recover it. Kevin, an aspiring musician, mistakes the Key for a synthesizer and takes it to a music store run by his friend Charlie (Barry Livingston). Karg's team arrives and chases Julie until He-Man finds and rescues her. Karg's team returns to Grayskull, Skeletor is incensed by their failure and kills Saurod, then sends the others back to Earth, with a larger army commanded by Evil-Lyn. Kevin is taken to Julie's house by Detective Lubic (Back to the Future's James Tolkan), who is investigating the disturbance created by Karg's team, he suspects the Key is stolen and confiscates it from Kevin. After Lubic leaves, Kevin is captured by Evil-Lyn, who uses a mind control collar to interrogate him for the Key's location. The Eternians and Julie release Kevin from the collar before they go after Lubic and the Key before Evil-Lyn and her group get to it. They reach Charlie's store, but Skeletor's forces catch up to them, there is a battle, during which Evil-Lyn recovers the Key and summons Skeletor to Earth. The Eternians are captured, Julie is mortally wounded, and He-Man surrenders to save his comrades and is returned to Eternia as Skeletor's slave. Skeletor demands that He-Man kneels before him for all of Eternia to see, before he is killed, the hero refuses and is lashed by Blade's laser whip. When the moon rises, Skeletor absorbs the powers of the universe, declaring himself the Master of the Universe, he asserts his victory and continues to torture He-Man with energy blasts. Back on Earth, Gwildor repairs the Cosmic Key, and Kevin recreates the tones necessary to create a gateway to Eternia. The group, including Lubic who tries to arrest them, are transported to Castle Grayskull, where they battle against Skeletor's forces. Evil-Lyn resents Skeletor for absorbing all the power of the Universe without sharing it with her, she deserts him along with the other henchmen. Skeletor accidentally frees He-Man, who reclaims the Sword of Grayskull, and they battle until He-Man shatters Skeletor's staff, eliminating his powers and restoring him to his normal state. He-Man offers mercy, but Skeletor draws a concealed sword and attempts to kill He-Man, but he is knocked into a towering pit below. The Sorceress is freed and heals Julie, a portal is opened to send the humans home to Earth, but Lubic is hailed as hero and decides to remain on Eternia. Julie has taken back in time and awakens on the morning of her parents are supposed to take the plane that will crash and kill them, she stops them from doing so. She runs outside to find Kevin, he confirms that everything they went through was real, while He-Man stands victorious in Eternia with his magic sword at the throne of Grayskull, shouting the immortal words ""I have the power!"" In the post-credits sequence, Skeletor emerges from the water and says, ""I'll be back!"". Also starring Jessica Nelson as Monica, Gwynne Gilford as Mrs. Winston and Walter Scott as Mr. Winston, and narrated by Peter Brooks. Lundgren has the right physique for the leading hero, but is wooden, Langella with the skull-faced makeup is reasonable as the villain, and it is nice to see a young Cox before her Friends fame, but Barty as the mad little goblin character is a little annoying, the story of a key enabling the holder to gain all power in the universe is uninspired, obvious and predictable, the fight and chase sequences are at times daft, and the special effects makeup and computer effects look painfully cheap and dated, it was a commercial and critical failure, it may get cult audiences, but the majority of those who dislike it is much higher, it is a rather silly and mildly terrible fantasy action adventure. Adequate!",Masters of the Universe
5,ma-cortes,Overwhelming fantasy about heroic He-man battling Skeletor in Eternia and Earth,6,3 August 2010,"A corpulent hero named He-man , a veteran warrior (John Cypher) , his daughter (Chelsea Field) , a likable midget (Billy Barty) fight in Eternia against a vile villain named Skeletor (Frank Langella as a Darth Vader clone) in a fantasy/Sci-Fi about rebel forces battling for the sake of freedom and engaged in a life or death war with the tyrant leader of a far planet . They transport themselves by means of a mechanism that creates a time hole to Earth in which nothing less the future of the universe is at stake . There they meet an intimate and youthful couple (Courney Cox , Richard Duncan). Meanwhile , Skeletor wants to get a chance by destiny to receive the powers of Grayskull . From a distant galaxy... they have come to Earth.
A battle fought in the stars, now... comes to Earth. The live-action motion picture . Only the universe could hold adventure this big!This is a medium-budgeted live-action rendition of the cartoon roles' feats in the ¨Star Wars¨ mold and characterized by He-man , Skeletor and many others . All of them blended together with wonderful and terrific special effects courtesy of Richard Edlund and special designs by Moebius .¨Masters of the Universe¨ is basically a lot of spectacular fight-scenes with a tiny bit of plot movement , full of sympathetic dialogue and flashy blasts of light and energy . It features stunted and disjointed action, as well as the hilarious but quite conventional characters partially fitting to the animated series . It includes abundant breathtaking images , which laboriously and mightily attempt to reproduce the source materials in some impressive scenes and eye-popping look .After his nasty roles in in ¨Rocky 4 (85)¨ and ¨A view to kill (85)¨ , the Swedish muscle mountain Dolph Lundgren starred this film and followed by ¨Red Scorpion (90)¨ and ¨Universal soldier (92)¨ in his successful period during the 80s and early 90s . Lundgren has certain acting ability and charisma enough to play this kind of heroes . Based on cartoon and famous toys by ¨Mattei Inc¨ that proved to be one of the biggest hits of all time . However , the characters and story may aim a little more at kiddies than teenagers and adults . For comical relief in charge of Billy Barty with his antics , sympathy and jokes . Other support actors giving enjoyable acting in brief appearances are as follows : James Tolkan , Meg Foster , John Cypher , Chelsea Field , and Christina Pickles as the imprisoned sorceress . The special effects are well made by the presitigious Richard Edlund , all they're cracked up to be and set a new cinematic standard for realistic realization . Action scenes have the zip and excitement you'd expect . The motion picture was well directed by Gary Goddard in his only filmmaking ; subsequently , he has dedicated to production and 3D . This would-be epic , surrounding the genres : ¨Sword and witchery¨ and ¨Sci-F¨results to be an entertaining and fun romp through space and time.",Masters of the Universe
6,paul_haakonsen,A terrible blow to the legacy of He-Man,3,4 February 2010,"I grew up watch the animated He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoons during the 80's, and I was a huge fan. I also loved the 2002 re-birth of the Masters of the Universe series. Heck, I even got a tattoo of He-Man (from the 2002 series) covering most of my back), that is how much a fan I am.But this movie. Wow! It was terrible in so many ways. It should never have been associated with the Masters of the Universe franchise. Not that I got anything against Dolph Lundgren - he have some fairly adequate movies to his name. But this movie was a gloveslap to the face of fans and an insult to He-Man.The movie is not bad in itself, if you distance it from the He-Man story. Had this movie been totally unassociated with Masters of the Universe it would have been acceptable.I remember when I was young and this movie came out, it killed off He-Man for me for a long, long time. But then thankfully I got over the crap that is this movie, and then were blessed when He-Man came back, mightier than ever in 2002.This movie should be watched as a sci-fi adventure movie, and try not to associate it with the Masters of the Universe story. You might just set yourself up for a major disappointment.",Masters of the Universe
7,Hey_Sweden,All very agreeable.,7,3 March 2012,"I suppose it does make a difference if one is like this viewer and loved the Mattel toys and the animated series as a child, so visiting this vintage big screen treatment is appealing enough to the kid that's still inside me who would have just lapped up something like this had he caught it when it first came out. I always thrilled for my dad to rent the tapes of the series. Now, of course, as an adult I can't help but laugh hearing something like ""I HAVE THE POWER!!!!!!!"", and see this as a very cheesy, silly affair, but again, it was meant for kids of the era and is still very likable.Appropriately cast Dolph Lundgren is He-Man, battling with associates Man-At-Arms (Jon Cypher) and his daughter Teela (Chelsea Field) against the forces of cackling, demonic bad guy Skeletor (the great Frank Langella, unrecognizable under the mask). Skeletor desperately needs to get his hands (or should that be bones?) on a ""cosmic key"" devised by lovable imp Gwildor (Billy Barty); said key opens dimensional ""doors"" and transports various characters good and bad to Earth, where they raise all sort of hell in their battles, and two teen lovers, Julie (a young Courteney Cox) and Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeill of 'Star Trek: Voyager') get caught up in all of it, along with a flustered detective (James Tolkan).The movie is quite easy to take from start to finish, with pacing that doesn't falter, lots of colourful visuals and effects, a score by Bill Conti automatically calling to mind John Williams' work for ""Superman"" and ""Star Wars"", and entertaining characters, although the villains definitely fare better than the heroes; Langella is commanding as Skeletor, and Meg Foster likewise delicious as Evil-Lyn. The four henchmen dispatched by skull face are an amusing bunch, especially the Beastman who looks rather like the character Alph from the futuristic action / exploitation flick ""Turkey Shoot"". But for this viewer, what makes this as much fun as it is, is the ass kicking character of Detective Lubic; Tolkan is hysterical in the role.A nice diversion overall, with a funny surprise for anybody who sits through the closing credits.Seven out of 10.",Masters of the Universe
8,CinemaSerf,"""Good Journey"" to the fridge, frequently....",6,7 May 2021,"OK, so we all have guilty pleasures - for some people it is chocolate, or cheese, or champagne... For me, it's all of these - especially when watching this. Now before you hit the off button, I think it is important to remember that this is not meant to stand up to much critical scrutiny. It is just a simple fantasy adventure with a pretty wooden cast and a some colourful visual effects that support a good old fashioned good v evil scenario. Dolph Lundgren is ""He-Man"", fresh from his drubbing at the hands of ""Rocky"" who must race to rescue the Sorceress from the evil ambitions of Frank Langella (""Skeletor"") and his evil sidekick ""Evil-Lyn"" (Meg Foster). The award for best pointy ears goes to Billy Barty as the arch-locksmith ""Gwildor"" who has devised this amazing device that can transport folks all over the galaxy via worm-hole style things. Soon the Grayskullians (?) have fled to Earth and embroiled love's young dreamers - Courtney Cox (""Julie"") and Robert Duncan McNeill (""Kevin"") - in their perilous escapades. It's got plenty of swash and buckle, police cars getting zapped and I always wanted that big electric chair thing that ""Skeletor"" arrived on Earth on. It apparently cost $22 million - though how they managed to spend all of that is almost as much mystery as their special key! What's not to like, eh? Go on, you know you want to...",Masters of the Universe
9,Bunuel1976,"MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE (Gary Goddard, 1987) **",4,25 January 2008,"I first watched this one on VHS in the late 1980sso it's another nostalgic trip down memory lane for me; besides, as a kid I used to love watching the animated series on TV  along with its short-lived predecessor, BLACKSTAR (1981)  and even owned toys of some of the characters! This is a juvenile live-action version and although watchable, it's still among the least adventure epics of its day: to begin with, the characters don't look much like their old selves and there's little use of the mythical Greyskull setting or He-Man's trademark ""I have the power"" line. Besides, the time-travel convention adopted for the film's main plot feels as ill-advised now as it seemed then, but is more like than not a measure of budgetary constraints on the part of the penny-pinching Cannon Group.Dolph Lundgren is a stolid He-Man; Frank Langella a campy yet unconvincing Skeletor (especially when he exchanges his typical hooded attire in blue for a mask and golden costume); Courteney Cox is the present-day heroine; Billy Barty's Gwildor replaces Orko from the animated series (but, then, there's no sign of Battlecator, for that matter, He-Man's mild-mannered alter-ego Adam either!); Meg Foster comes off best as Evil-Lyn, with the good sorceress (who has been turned into an old crone by Skeletor) at the other end of the scale; admittedly, James Tolkan, is quite fun as the tough but bewildered modern-day cop. While there's plenty of mindless (if uninspired) action throughout, Skeletor's army is lazily depicted as a black-clad variant on the 'stormtroopers' from the STAR WARS saga  while his gallery of mutants is, at best, a forgettable lot! Skeletor even re-emerges from his watery grave after the end credits had rolled  thus promising a follow up which, perhaps unsurprisingly, never materialized...",Masters of the Universe
10,utgard14,"""I dare anything! I am Skeletor!""",5,15 September 2016,"Cannon movie based on the popular toy line and cartoon series from my childhood. I should say loosely based, as it rips off everything from Star Wars to Flash Gordon, all the while borrowing precious little of worth from the He-Man mythos and purportedly being a tribute of sorts to Jack Kirby's New Gods. You could look at all those connections and say ""well this just sounds like a pile of awesome"" but you would be wrong.I hated this movie with a passion when I was a kid, mainly because it felt nothing like the He-Man I knew and more like some generic sci-fi action movie that had the Masters of the Universe name attached. But over the years I've grown to appreciate a lot of movies I didn't like when they were first released. And I do appreciate this more than I did then, but I'm still not ready to say it's a good film. Its value is in its badness, particularly Frank Langella's delightfully campy performance as Skeletor. Unfortunately he's not in the entire movie. The bulk of the film takes place on Earth with He-Man and friends running around with Courteney Cox and trying not to be killed by the goons Skeletor has sent after them. Most of this is just boring.Other than Langella, the cast is either adequate (Meg Foster, Courteney Cox, Jon Cypher, James Tolkan) or terrible (Billy Barty). Dolph Lundgren is wooden to the point that it makes his previous performance as Drago in Rocky IV seem like Hamlet. The budget is obviously very low and the costumes and special effects are cheesy. It's worth a look for fans of Cannon and He-Man. See it for the campiness and fast-forward to the Skeletor scenes.",Masters of the Universe
11,neil-476,Good adaptation,7,23 April 2011,"My son loved He-Man when he was a kid (the original cartoons, not the remakes), and we watched them A LOT.Then along came this live action version, so what was it like.Actually, it was a more than halfway decent realisation of a cheap and cheerful, formulaic Saturday morning cartoon. It had a reasonable budget, it had Dolph Lundgren as He-Man and, despite any acting reservations, he certainly looked the part), and most of the expected supporting characters turned up. Battlecat was a bit much to cope with in pre-CGI days, and while I was pleased that the irritating Urko had been dropped, he was replaced by the equally irritating and broadly equivalent Gwildor. And Frank Langella, in a largely immobile mask, gave us a Skeletor who was more a sinister tactician than a cackling maniac.But it was fun. It never took itself seriously, but it never betrayed its source material by playing it for laughs either. It had bags of action (much of which took place on Earth, thus avoiding the cost of creating large chunks of Eternia, and it had an early appearance by Courtney Cox. Who was cute.Recommended for rekindling those childhood memories.",Masters of the Universe
12,FlashCallahan,i'm not in the giving mood today....,7,27 March 2011,"On the planet Eternia, evil Skeletor and his army of darkness have taken over Castle Greyskull, the mysterious castle, and imprisoned The Sorceress of Greyskull, and Skeletor has begun draining The Sorceress of Greyskull's powers as he bids to claim the powers of Greyskull and become master of the universe.Mighty warrior He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe and his companions loyal soldier Man-at-Arms, his daughter Teela and a dwarf inventor named Gwildor accidentally finds themselves on Earth, by Gwildor's creation, The Cosmic Key, a device that can open portals that lead to any part of the galaxy, which Skeletor requires in his goal for universal conquest.But when the Comsic Key is taken in possession by Julie Winston and her boyfriend Kevin, both unaware Earth is about to become a battleground, as Skeletor and his mercenaries arrives on Earth, as they go in pursuit of He-Man and his companions who are searching for The Cosmic Key ....A pure guilty pleasure of any sort. Lundgren plays He-man in the guise of the plastic doll he is based on and his acting is incredibly bland. Sometimes his lines feel so rushed that they are just laughable.On the other hand, Langella seems to be having a whale of a time playing Skeletor and almost comes across as a Shakespearian villain.He absolutely rules the film, and it feels a little flat whenever he isn't in it.The rest of the cast are a little annoying, and I really wished the character of Kevin was slapped around a bit more. But for a kids film, it's really fun, and there is plenty for adults to enjoy too. The action scenes are adequate, and the special effects surprisingly good for a Cannon film, but ultimately, this film is forgettable and some of the camera-work is really bad (seeing Dolph swing a sword from a front perspective is a standout).Well worth watching if you were a fan of the cartoon.",Masters of the Universe
13,Aaron1375,Masters of the Universe really came out two years to late.,6,29 July 2012,"This film came out in 1987 which was two years after the Transformers movie (the cartoon). It also came on two years after the last new episode of the cartoon was made. Basically, it pretty much was a done franchise when the live action adaptation hit the big screen. I was a fan of the cartoon, so I went to this film, but even at this young age I was not the fan I once was. Transformers took the mantle of my favorite cartoon. Still, I thought it would be cool to see a live action He-man, which I remember reading about in my He-man monthly magazine. What graces the screen is a mixed bag. You find yourself saying 'that is pretty cool' while at the same time going 'this really isn't much like the cartoon'. The film was released by Canon, which is odd mainly due to the fact they mainly released 'R' rated, over the top violence and bloody movies during this time. Here they release a children's film and do so with a rather large budget...over 20 million. They cast Dolph in the role of He-man and had a few other stars of note in what would be a doomed franchise in that it never made it passed the first initial film.The story has Skeletor basically in charge. He has taken over Castle Greyskull, he has the sorceress in his evil clutches and he has He-man and his two allies Man-At-Arms and Teela on the run. So already it is nothing like the cartoon as I just do not remember any episodes where Skeletor was this ahead of the game. It is kind of like the Transformers film in that in that one the Decepticons were winning despite never really challenging the Autobots during the course of the show. It is also more forgiving here as this is a live action movie, independent of the cartoon, while the Transformers were a continuation of the show. Well He-man and company run across a little creature named Gwildor. I do think they should of just named him Orko and be down with it, cause that is obviously who he was in essence. Well this creature has a device that transports our gang from Eternia to Earth and thus Hollywood once again uses the trick of setting what should be a battle on a fantasy world to Earth. Earth, the place where sets are not as expensive. We also get these two teenagers who have drama in their lives, making me wonder, who the heck were these two characters trying to appeal to? Not me, or my friend as we both found their romance and storyline boring. Well there are battles aplenty and when the film is focused on the action it is pretty good.Dolph is okay as He-man, he certainly has the looks. Still, he does not look at home in a child friendly film in costume. Frank Langella seems right at home though as the evil Skeletor and he does a commendable job. He also has the coolest scene in the film, where his giant throne like ship comes rising up behind our characters. The rest of the cast do okay, get rid of the two teens and their asinine sad plot and this film could of been great. Not saying we should not have an earthling for the gang to interact with, but not the girl from the Bruce Springsteen video! Seriously, were they trying to attract teens that would not want to see a He-man film in a million years or what? If they were looking to attract teen guys, all the simply had to do was put Teela in the costume she wore in the cartoon.So basically the film has some good and some bad. A bit more good than bad. The film plays like other films like Star Wars and Krull with the added additions of the He-man and Skeletor characters. I do not understand the inclusions of the newer characters, because at this point the toy was finished so why not have more of the characters from the show. Why Gwilder instead of Orko? They at least had Teela, Man-At-Arms, Evilyne and Beastman, but those new characters were just lame. Well Sauron was cool and not in the movie for long. Karg and Blademaster were just embarrassing looking. The film though has some good action, between the melodrama and this film while not perfect did probably the best it could with the budget and the source material. Had the rights been bought by a bigger film company I am sure it could have done better. This film reminds me of the Dragonball: Evolution film, it too was released well after the show's popularity had fallen, only this one was not the failure it was, because even it followed the source material better than that film. So an okay action flick with some fantasy touches.",Masters of the Universe
14,zetes,"Not awful, just boring",5,5 January 2016,"I remember hating this when I was a kid, I'm guessing because they changed so much stuff from my beloved cartoon. Of course, the cartoon was garbage in the first place, I realize now, only existing to sell toys. The toys were pretty cool. Revisiting the film almost 30 years later, and knowing that it came from the Canon Film Group, I was hoping for a dumpster fire of a film, something my friend and I could laugh at. Unfortunately, it's borderline competent, which is quite a bit worse. It's more or less a rip-off of Star Wars and Conan the Barbarian. The script is awful, but the production design and costumes are very good. Cheaper than Star Wars, obviously, but still not bad at all. Frank Langella plays the villain, Skeletor, fairly well, and Meg Foster is a good henchwoman to him. The heroes are less interesting, with Dolph Lundgren as He-Man (most annoying, he's off screen for long periods of time). The film is perhaps most famous now for co-starring a young Courtney Cox. The film as a whole is kind of a bore and pretty forgettable, which is probably how I felt as a kid, too.",Masters of the Universe
15,Mr-Fusion,"From the people who butchered Superman, comes . . . an oddly likable movie!",7,16 November 2012,"It's a funny thing; when I watch ""Masters of the Universe"" I tend to view the movie as a straight sword-n-sorcery adventure, very much of its '80s time and place. And on those terms, I think it's a pretty cool flick. It's got its share of cheese, don't get me wrong (pretty much all of Courtney Cox's subplot), but that's not enough to kill it. Dolph Lundgren makes for a solid hero and he's great for the role's physicality. But it's clearly Frank Langella who steals this thing, buried under makeup but still owning his scenes.It's interesting to see what came out of Cannon in 1987. ""Superman IV"" was a disaster, and yet ""Masters of the Universe"" somehow works. Chock full of swords, lasers, ships, otherworldly heroes and still grounded in a contemporary setting. Were I a more devoted He-Man fan, this might leave a sour taste in my mouth. But comparing it to others of its type (""Conan the Barbarian"", ""Krull"", ""Willow"") it ain't bad at all.7/10",Masters of the Universe
16,lost-in-limbo,These plastic action-figurines are alive!,5,7 March 2007,"War has broken out on the planet Eternia and the evil Skeletor has taken prison the Sorceress of Greyskull castle in the hope of capturing her powers, so he can rule Eternia and finally the universe. Though leading the resistance is He-man and small group of freedom fighters. They rescue Gwildor who has created a device called the cosmic key that Skeletor could use to move between galaxies. To escape the overwhelming forces, He-man and his friends are transported to Earth. Two earthlings stumble across the key and soon find themselves caught in between a universal battle of good and evil.This one definitely brings back mixed memories. I loved the TV cartoon series of He-man and collected the toy figurines (which the movie is based on) when was a young kid. So naturally when the movie came out, there was no doubting that I wouldn't go out and see it with my father. ""Masters of the Universe"" was actually the first film I saw at the cinemas and the only time I ever walked out of one. Firstly: Skeletor and his minions totally freaked me out. Call me a wuss, but loved how they were represented as bumbling villains in the cartoons. Secondly; I didn't particularly get into the serious direction it went for and the whole mythology the cartoon series drew up was severally lacking. The magic and humour was nowhere to be seen on this live feature length presentation.This was my third viewing of it and I still found it to be an averagely uninspired and bloated clunker that somewhat resembles that of a ""Star Wars""-""Flash Gordon"" hybrid. If it wasn't for Frank Langella's theatrically imposing portrayal as the malevolently power-hungry Skeletor and a lusciously icy Meg Foster as the vindictively sly Evil-Lyn (Yep, I don't mind how viciously wicked they are now). This would have just been another forgettable fantasy fodder.The costumes and make-up (especially Skeletor's mercenaries) do look vividly striking and convincing, but the variably dazzling special effects with its pyrotechnics light show and grand scale treatment became dreadfully cheesy, but I guess this made it mildly fun and diverting. The budget is reasonably minor and you can honestly tell, despite with its striking set designs for Eternia and this is why most of the story takes place on earth. Director Gar Goddard does quite an generic job with David Odell's scratchily rapid screenplay (with an uncalled for sappy conclusion), but the speedy story does have its moments and Goddard generates a couple exciting flashes of creative gusto. This is mostly when the villains are on the screen or when James Tolken's slightly humorous Detective Lubic gets caught up in the mayhem. The script is singly minded, but there a few risible lines delivered with strenuous conviction by Langella. The glistening gold Dolph Lundgren looks the part and does the action scenes quite well, but he does provides nothing but a monotonously laconic performance. Courtney Cox's debut film role is nothing spectacular, but reasonable. John Cypher as Man-at-arms and Chelsea Field as Teela provide sound contributions. Robert Duncan McNeill's rabbit in the headlights performance is pretty weak and Billy Barty very much annoys as Gwildor. Bill Conti's corny and grand sounding music score is easily influenced by ""Star Wars"" musical score and I got that feeling it tweak around with the ""Superman"" one too.""Masters of the Universe"" is a weird live-action cartoon that's full of hiccups, but with its overblown nature and fast pacing it amuses without much fuss.",Masters of the Universe
17,Robert_duder,"Other than the names, it holds very little to the He-Man legend and yet he as a cult feel to it",7,21 July 2008,"I think the biggest problem with Masters of The Universe is not that it is incredible cheesy with a sub par cast, not the best story, and an overall attempt at being serious that comes off laughable...it's the fact that Masters of The Universe strays so incredibly far from it's origins. Masters of The Universe has so little that is actually taken from the original cartoon series, or the action figures for that matter. Sure the names are the same on the lead characters, their world is mentioned, Castle Grayskull is in tact but where does it go from there? There is no battlecat, there is no Prince turning into He-Man in secret, instead the writers and/or film makers chose to take Masters of The Universe in a strange and rather typical eighties way and bring it to earth. Now in some ways this is a cool idea but overall it kind of kills the whole Masters of The Universe idea. Pile on top of that they rip their Eternian minions right out of Star Wars and aren't apologetic about it at all. There are some very good things about Masters of The Universe, part of the reason why it is a cult classic and an absolutely favorite to some.Dolph Lundgren probably actually gives one of his best performances, following Ivan Drago in Rocky IV as He-Man himself. I mean the role is campy as anything but Lundgren is obviously taking it dead serious and that is just fun. I would have loved to have seen him try to the whole dual identity of Prince Adam and He-Man but they scrapped that entirely. Still he looks awesome as the blond hair, muscle rippling hero with the sword. And when he belts out ""I have the power!"" well it's just movie magic. Frank Langella probably gives the best performance in the film as the wickedly evil Skeletor. He looks awesome and plays the role brilliantly. Probably one of the more faithful characters carried over from the cartoon series. He isn't used as much as I would have hoped but the final battle between him and He-Man is excellent. Meg Foster is also pretty darn good as Skeletor's right hand woman Evil-Lyn. She looks the part and is really truly a great bad girl nemesis. She isn't used as much as she should be either. Jon Cypher and Chelsea Field are the father/daughter duo Man-At-Arms and Teela ported from the cartoon. They bother look their roles and they do a decent supporting job but they are left as very under developed characters unfortunately. Courteney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeill are the earth couple that get caught in the cross fire of Eternia's inter-dimensional battle. They really get all the focus on their characters and that is really unfortunate. I mean they both are good in their roles but we don't wanna see earth characters we don't know compared to Skeletor and He-Man and all the other amazing characters we grew up with. 80's character actor phenomenon James Tolkan brings his typical role to Masters of The Universe as tough no nonsense cop Detective Lubic. His role is exactly the same as the one that made him famous ""you're nothing but a slacker McFly."" And finally you have Billy Barty playing the little knome like creature Gwildor who is an okay character especially for kids but why in the hell did he not play Orco? WHERE WAS ORCO?!? He was my favorite and would have made this film substantially better!! So we have a strong cast and overall the special effects are actually very good for their time. Plenty of laser fights with the complete Darth Vadar rip off minions, sword battles, flying vehicles, explosions, and a few creatures as well. But imagine the incredible host of strange creatures they could have used from the TV Series. Skunkor, Mer-Man, Buzz Off, and the ones they did use hardly got any screen time like Beast Man and Saurod. First time director Gary Goddard obviously cared very little for the enormous fan base around He-Man and cared very little about re-creating that world in live action because that is still every He-Man fan's fantasy to this day. It is said that star Lundgren worked with Goddard to re-tool some of the action scenes and He-Man's role and in that way he might have saved this from being a complete disaster. Like many 80's films I think this one has a place in many of our hearts and will always be a guilty little classic but as far as bringing He-Man to life you'll only get a smidgen of what could have been done. Rumor has another one in the works, let's hope they do it right. Still see this one for all it's crazy campy glory because it's not the worst thing out there. 7/10",Masters of the Universe
18,richardchatten,Cannon Fodder,5,16 March 2021,"Golan & Globus struck again with this juvenile melange of 'Star Wars', 'Flash Gordon' (rendering Frank Langella as unrecognisable as Skeletor as Peter Wyngarde had been as Klytus) and 'Blake's 7' without the dry wit and deft characterisation. Even with a final cut delivered by the woman who edited 'Laurence of Arabia', like 'Star Wars' it goes on a bit, but at least is minus all that pompous Force talk (although in Gwildor it almost creates a 'funny' creature as annoying as Jar Jar Binks).Unusually but inexpensively it's mostly set on present day Earth (hence the drab backdrops to most of the action and the nasty mullets the men wear) and a couple of times a character has the temerity to declare this is real life we're talking about here.

19,bowmanblue,The second most wonderfully cheesy movie of all time,8,20 September 2014,"If it wasn't for the ultimate in sci-fi cheese-fest aka Flash Gordon in 1980, then Masters of the Universe would rightly hold the title. However, second place isn't bad. And nor is the film either.If you're looking for Oscar-worthy performances, big-budget special effects and great character development then look elsewhere. This is NOT Avatar.What this is is a tale loosely based on the classic eighties figures of He-man and co. On the planet of Eternia, the evil Skeletor is trying to take over the universe and it's up to He-man and his furry underwear to save the day. Of course this involves a trip to Earth to the only place in the world where no one takes any notice of large muscular men wielding swords in their Y-fronts.It's very daft and you won't know whether to laugh or cry. But it's still enormous fun. It may not have the budget of the acting performances of Lord of the Rings, but with Lord of the Rings, you couldn't really cheer loudly for the characters as well as you can with Masters of the Universe.This is fun for all the family (especially if you were either a young boy in the eighties - like me - or simply someone who can appreciate cheesy movies for what they are - also me). Don't take this too seriously - it was never meant to be that way. Just put your brain on hold and enjoy the silliness of the ride.(Oh, and did I mention there's a very young Courtney Cox to see, long before the start of Friends!)",Masters of the Universe

The thing is, this is just a dumb cheesy clichéd movie. It takes that tired premise so many bad live-action adaptations do where they send the characters to our world. Now I actually will defend that a little. This actually was the first live-action adaptation to actually do that, so at the time it wasn't clichéd, but it's still pretty dumb. What I also resent about this movie is this part at the end where the people outright say that they don't want to travel back in time or anything.Courtney Cox's parents died, so it seemed like she had gotten over their deaths. Instead, they broke this moral and she saves her parents. Come on, even the Keanu Reeves version of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" got that right! The best memory I have of this series is probably Orko and wouldn't you know it? He isn't in this movie! They replaced him with this obnoxious ugly guy with gills. I really have no idea why, it's just another stupid factor. I actually heard that the actor who played Skeletor did not do this for the money and genuinely enjoyed his role. Good for him. *1/2",Masters of the Universe

And with all the missing He-Man elements, the bad acting, half-baked plot, and cheesy effects aren't offset by any nostalgia.

22,tomgillespie2002,Derivative and insipid,2,25 February 2012,"During the 1980's the world of advertising and general marketing took on an all invasive, sinister tone. After the success of the Star Wars toy line from Hasbro, the industry began a series of fantasy toy lines that used the 30 minute Saturday morning cartoon as an advertising tool. This led to famous toy's/cartoons such as Tranformers, Thundercats et al (there are way too many to list in this review. I believe the first of these was the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, which hawked a band of sword-and-sandal-like fantasy characters, in a world called Eternia.The cartoon and toy line were incredibly successful, and whilst as an adult, my cynical side sees the enormity of this exploitative marketing, as a child I was totally sucked in. With the unbridled achievement of cynical marketing, it was only a matter of time before the Hollywood machine would take the buff character of He-man and immortalise the c**t on screen.The 1980's also saw an increase of over sized muscle-men on the big screen. This was of course reflective of Reagan's politics of big-is- good etcetera. So with such a low-rent project, the film needed a pretty low-rent, muscular ""actor"". I'm guessing that even Schwarzenegger and Stallone were too good for this film, as the actor chosen to play the homo-erotic, buff-dunce He-man was Dolph Lundgren, another of the increasingly large action stars of the decade.The story involves a set of keys that can open a portal to other worlds/dimensions, and He-man's evil foe, Skeletor (Frank Langela) obviously wants the set. During a battle in Snake mountain, the hero's are forced to go through a portal where they find themselves in contemporary America, and take on the help of a native, Julie (Courtney Cox).This derivative, insipid film is just awful. The action is more than likely placed in a Earth-bound setting for budgetary reasons. And to be fair, even if this was not the case, it would probably be just as s**t. I did see this at the cinema at the time, and probably liked it. But seeing this as an adult just makes me realise that there was an abundance of genuinely awful movies in the decade of greed.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Masters of the Universe

Some minor spoilersGrowing up I watched the greatest cartoon,He-Man and the Masters Of The Universe.I loved to the muscles of He-Man and all of great monsters that was in the show.Not to mention the great villian Skeletor. Really he was the star of the show.He had some good men like Evil Lyn,Beast Man and MerMan and Trap Jaw and Cyclops among others.When I saw that they were going to make a movie of the greatest cartoon the world has ever seen I went crazy.I just couldn`t belive it.When I saw the movie I was in awe!I wasn`t diappointed not one bit.I was so happy to see Dolph Lundren as He-Man and Frank Langella as Skeletor.They act very close as to how they were in the cartoon.Tella and Man-At-Arms is in it also although only two villiams from the cartoon are in it and thats Evil-Lyn and Beast Man but don`t worry there are three newer villians thats just as good.Saurod,a retilian type warrior.Blade,a bald swordsman and Karg,and warrior with hooks as for hands.I like James Tolken in this movie,he acts very well and you see a very young Coutneey Cox and Billy Barty as well.The music in this picture is great.Please if you can find the score please buy it you will not regret it.I am so happy that this movie was made,If you liked the cartoon I`M very sure you`ll like this.Please see this,its very action packed and it`s an adventure you`ll never forget!",Masters of the Universe

25,johnnyboyz,"Now, quite a shameful and poorly done attempt at a sci-fi franchise but a pleasant nostalgic trip if that scenario also applies.",5,8 December 2008,"I have read in the past about people, as young children, replaying the original Star Wars films from the late 1970s, early 1980s over and over again on home videotape once they became available, that the tapes have become old and worn through repetition. True as that may be I will never know because I never saw a Star Wars film properly until the last year and a half or so but one science fiction/adventure hybrid fable I did have on videotape through one means or another was this: Masters of the Universe, an under funded and pretty poorly thought through piece from a bunch of 'C' going on 'D' list talent made in the mid to late 1980s.I saw this film recently for the first time in what must be a decade-plus and while I didn't wear out the tape all those years ago, I saw it enough times to take a trip down memory for this occasion. You don't remember lines of dialogue or gripping narratives in scenarios like this, you remember individual shots and facial expressions from the film. As it was, Teela's (Field) reaction shot when she finds out what she's eating very early on in the film was one of them as was Gwildor's (Barty) joyous and knowing expression towards the end when he sends certain characters to a point in Earth's history they will appreciate.But enough of that and to cut right to the chase, the film is pretty poor. Although, it's that watchable sort of rubbish that accompanies the fact you saw it as a child so often that the experience now is a trip down memory lane rather than an out and out first time film viewing. To some, this might be the worst film they've ever seen and I wouldn't have a problem with that; to others, it may be their favourite and I wouldn't have a problem with that although I would point out to them that their childhood links with the piece has blinded them somewhat.I read only now that the film was originally going to take place on the planet of Eternia but budget limitations brought it to Earth  there's your first clue as to how ordinary it is. The fact the film's idea of where it wanted it set had to be scrapped should really have been enough to dissuade the producers from making it, surely. But, it didn't and of course we're all glad it didn't. Masters of the Universe is one of those strange hybrids that has a clear cut hero in He-Man (Lundgren) come out of where he's familiar with (Eternia) and travel to a far off place in order to achieve something. In this case, it's Earth in order to escape evil Skeletor (Langella) and his foes who want control of an item called 'The Cosmic Key' little creature Gwildor has created. This key enables folk to travel from planet to planet and, naturally, Skeletor wants control of this contraption.But instead of being a circular journey in which a hero leaves their homeland; fights battles and defeats evil before returning home an even bigger hero, the film presents us with a typical high school romance involving Kevin (McNeill) and Julie (Cox). The idea that He-Man is the focus is still very much present but it is Julie we have more of a connection with as an audience as we feel she may be in peril at certain times and her back-story may touch us somewhat.But the film is really just a collection of nice outfits and rather unbelievable scenes. The film needs to happen in the early hours of the morning on Earth for the sake of convenience and the heroes know they have until 'moonrise' on Eternia to achieve their goal because Skeletor was kind enough to tell them that ultimatum much earlier on. Initially, monsters resembling wolf-man rip-offs and rejected Predator prototypes are sent to Earth as a scout party but it isn't long before Skeletor himself and an army of his soldiers, most of which wear body armour that resembles the troopers' in Star Wars, arrive to check things out for themselves.Although perhaps the actors in the soldier suits are the lucky ones as they don't get to have their faces revealed. I think everyone in the film, especially by the end, is accepting this as Reaganism inspired, tongue in cheek action/adventure and nothing more. Frank Langella does a great job in bellowing his lines, demanding he be worshipped as the most powerful being in the universe  indeed 'God'. But that's all he's doing and the fact the rest of the acting talent is an array of stunt men, Karate fighters and actors more used to television work sort of grates in the end, although it does bring a certain quirkiness to certain characters.The film has its charm, no doubt about it. A pumping synthetic 80s soundtrack and a great turn from James Tolkan, otherwise known as Principal Strickland from Back to the Future, whose best line is ""Nobody takes pop shots at Lubic!"" are some here and there highlights but it isn't really enough to cloud adult judgement on a childhood 'favourite'. Skeletor may have been the most powerful being in the universe at one point and he may have wanted to remain like that but how does one so powerful explain the stupidity of having a huge pit complete with lava at the bottom mere feet from where you rule on high in your throne? Regardless, I don't think he'll be back.",Masters of the Universe

And we were young enough to not see how low the budget was.But, man, Frank Langella really sold his role didn't he? He brought his A-Game to this and knocked it out of the park.And Chelsea Field deserved better roles, she's never been bad in any of her films, even this low budget fair.But, watching it as an adult... it's a lot more B-Movie than it was when I was a kid, and the nostalgia and, well, Langella, are all that's really carrying it.

28,jimbo-53-186511,Iffy special effects and performances to match coupled with an uninvolving story results in Masters Of The Universe being a fairly weak offering across the board,4,18 September 2018,"On planet Eternia, Skeletor is attempting to gain control of Castle Grayskull and the sorceress of Castle Grayskull and a special 'key' are integral to his success. Locksmith and inventor Gwildor has the key that Skeletor requires, but Gwildor, He-Man, Duncan & Teela all escape Skeletor's clutches and open a gateway portal to planet Earth. Unfortunately, along the way the key gets lost and boyfriend and girlfriend Kevin & Julie unwittingly activate the key allowing Skeletor and his team to locate it. It's now up to He-Man and his small team to protect Julie & Kevin, defeat Skeletor and ultimately take back control of Grayskull...From the rather cheesy opening credits I was already a little bit worried about how Masters Of The Universe was going to pan out. Ever the optimist, I hoped that the cheesy opening credits would give way to a campy-cheesy and fun throwaway action-adventure film. Well I suppose it was kind of campy and was definitely throwaway, but fun it certainly was not. This forms part of the problem and director Gary Goddard has perhaps made the film a little too dark and serious (which will only work with a strong story and well developed characters). It's evident early on that Masters Of The Universe doesn't really contain either of the aforementioned elements which merely results in a film that you can look at and one that 'passes the time' but does little to involve the audience. To be fair attempts are made at comic relief by the Gwildor character, but he doesn't exactly have the best of dialogue and unfortunately, for me, he wasn't a very funny character.In fact, the only thing that made me partly enjoy this film was the special effects; not because they were good, but because they were so bad that they actually made me laugh; - the opening credits are supposed to be 'Wow' but look terrible. The cinematography and sets look cheap and dated (and one wonders if that may have been the case even back in 1987). Even laser guns (which can look good) come across as third rate here. I think my favourite bad special effect was the 'laser whip' which again looked more ridiculous than cool.The acting is about as poor as you'd expect; with the possible exceptions of Frank Langella and James Tolkan who seem to be the only people who seem to have made any effort. The former is particularly good bringing the necessary menace and evil of Skeletor to the screen very well - in fact it's safe to say that many of the best scenes in this film were the ones that Langella was involved in.As I mentioned earlier, the highlight of the film for me were the laughably bad special effects and at the end of the day if that's the kindest thing that you can say about a film then you know that it's a bit of a stinker.",Masters of the Universe

No, but it makes for great entertainment . You get Dolf Lundren with a mullet wig, a gnome wearing a Haiwain shirt eating fried chicken , laser guns, sword fights, a teenage Corteney Cox, keyboards ,bad acting.

31,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Mediocre at Best,5,20 December 2013,"It's no surprise that after the success of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983) cartoon that Hollywood became interested in creating a live-action version of the series. However, it turned out to be a financial and critical blunder for everyone - crewmembers and audiences alike. It's pretty much a split right down the middle. It either will be enjoyed or it won't be. I for one had a hard time figuring out where my stance is. It certainly is not even close to being a good movie but it also isn't close to being a terrible film either. It's just blah.The film starts out with already what seems like a finale to the film - Skeletor (Frank Langella) has captured the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull and wants to lure He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) himself into a trap so he can acquire the powers of Grayskull. All Skeletor needs is He-Man's sword. But writer David Odell thought it would be a good idea to create a subplot that involved a gizmo called the ""Cosmic Key"" that can transport anybody anywhere across the universe. But the only way to make this item work is to play a musical tune out of the finger pads surrounding it. I mean, it's an OK plot device but it's not necessary.Upon being ambushed when He-Man arrives to confront Skeletor, a portal is opened from the cosmic key and he lands on Earth. From there a boy and a girl find the instrument and mistake it for a synthesizer. How 80s like. It's because of this plot device that carries the whole film. As a whole, it's a chase, but it's a slow chase. And kind of cumbersome too. Every scene is one clichéd chase after another where each team is a step behind the other. It's just so happens that everything occurs coincidentally with one another to string along a very thin plot line. It's not great entertainment but one should also understand that it isn't unwatchable either.To be fair, this film stays pretty faithful to the cartoon. Everything from the set design of Eternia, to the costume design of each character looks and feels like the cartoon was rendered into the real world. Dolph Lundgren's physic matches He-Man accurately as does his co-star Jon Cypher as Man-At-Arms (with that brush of a mustache). Frank Langella as Skeletor was an okay choice, but his make up could have been done better and he could have at least tried to make his voice a little higher pitched. The same goes for many of the other creature like characters. In some ways, they remind me of Steve Wang's creature costumes. I did wish the character of Man-E-Faces was included though. He was an awesome character.What's even more interesting is too see a very young Courteney Cox as the girl. However, that doesn't mean that the acting is great. For the actors that take part in this, the performances aren't really convincing. No one's performance really feels genuine, nor is any of the dialog anything special. Even for an 80s movie, you'd think there'd be cheesy one liners - not even that. But again, it's not terrible, just plain. But, the other aspect I did find gratifying was Bill Conti's score to the film. I am confused to why he didn't reuse the theme from the cartoon but his new tune sounds praiseworthy none the less. There is a theme and it sounds heroic. Too bad it can't support all the other dead weight.For a live-action film, it stays faithful to the cartoon and has a good musical score, but its' actors' performances are barely passable and the writing is too silly.",Masters of the Universe
32,Rob_Taylor,A pretty poor movie overall.,4,25 December 2002,"One of my biggest disappointments as far as movies go. Having grown up with He-Man, I watched the film with hope, but, despite not having seen the cartoon for a number of years before I watched this on VHS, I still spotted the gaping holes. No Battle-Cat, no Orko (not that I really missed him - never liked Orko) and since when was He-Man permanently He-Man? What happened to Adam?Dolph Lundgren's He-Man was just perfect as far as physical resemblance goes. Just like Arnie in the Conan movies, you had no trouble believing he was the main character. But unlike Arnie, whose acting weaknesses actually came across as social ineptitude on Conan's part and enhanced the image, Dolph's acting and accent ruined any credulity he had as He-Man.
Despite being set on Earth (no budget for Eternia, apparently) the film is saved primarily by James Tolkan's character, Det. Lubic, a cop with an attitude. I ended up watching it more for him than anything else. Basically it's the same character he played in Back to the Future.Billy Barty reprises his village wizard role from Willow here, albeit with more make-up.Interesting to see Robert Duncan McNeill here. He later went on to play Tom Paris in the Voyager series.Apart from the unforgiveable liberties taken with the source material (at least it's not as bad as Dungeons and Dragons!) the film's biggest letdown was Skeletor. Oh. Frank Langella plays the part well enough, but I'm referring to the rubber skull mask he wore. It was just so lame and obvious. And since when did Skeletor have eyeballs anyhow?A pretty poor movie overall and something only the youngest fans will enjoy due to the extreme low budget and lack of understanding of the materiel on the part of the producers, writers and director.",Masters of the Universe

But by the time the motion picture came out, I had already seen movies like STAR WARS, THE LAST STARFIGHTER and KRULL. Now that was stuff that really impressed me when I was a kid. So, even when I was rather young at the time MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE came out, it didn't impress me much. I remember thinking something along the lines of ""What's with all this running-on-earth-crap? Where's Eternia?"". So over the years I kinda forgot about it. Until recently when I was at my parent's place and found a copy of it. So, back at my place, I popped this baby into my good ol' vcr and thought ""Let's see what we make of it now."" And yep, it's a pretty bad film. It's cheesy & silly, to say the least. But strangely, after a while, you just accept the silliness and go with it. The story is yet another take on the 'good vs evil'-concept. Skeletor wants to absorb all the powers of the universe. In order to do that, he needs a key which has been transported to earth together with He-man and his friends.The special effects & make-up are more or less okay, maybe cheesy at times, but hey, it was the 80's. Some things were just very bad about this movie: the annoying little midget-troll (obviously inserted for some comic relief), the key-gadget made these really stupid synthesizer-sounds, the fact that Julie gets re-united with her parents (which were DEAD, by the way) at the end of the movie (really bad move, scriptwriters), Robert Duncan McNeill just can NOT act (and he's not the only one in this movie),etc...And what about Mr. Goldilox, Dolph Lundgren? Well, I think at the time it was a good decision to cast him as He-man. This was to be his break-through roll, possibly lifting him to Schwarzenegger-heights. Sadly, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE failed miserably at the box-office. Though that wasn't Lundgren's fault, but when it comes to being a good actor, well, the fact that you can read in the end-credits that he needed a speech-coach AND a drama-coach to pull this one off, proves enough, doesn't it? By the way, notice that he has almost no lines in this movie. And perhaps the most unforgivable thing: At the end of the movie, when he raises his sword and shouts the most famous words ""I Have The Power"", you can see that his lip-movement isn't synchronized. Slightly hilarious, I call that.On the good side: Frank Langella is awesome as Skeletor. His lines are good and you truly believe he's evil. Classy B-queen Meg Foster, with those oh so mesmerizing eyes, is also excellent as the icy-cold Evil-Lyn. This movie features also one of the coolest bounty-hunters I've ever seen: Saurod (that lizard-guy with the pulsating throat and the neat helmet. Pity that he doesn't do much and dies quickly). James""kletskop""Tolkan was also very enjoyable as detective Lubic. And that's about it. Not even Courteney Cox' performance is memorable, but she had me laughing every time she came on simply because she was in this flick, looking young and 80's. Oh yeah, the floating platform fight was kinda groovy too. Though the scene was executed rather poorly, it was fun seeing an action-figure of Lundgren on a board flying around. Goofy stuff.While MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE isn't a good film at all, it still manages to entertain on a spectacular, cheesy sorta level. And it's a must see for kids, I believe. Just wait until they're just old enough to understand the dialogues & story, and I'll guarantee you they'll shut up, watch and love it.Now the film-critic in me is saying ""Don't you dare give this movie more than 3 stars!""... Screw him, I'm gonna do it anyway.",Masters of the Universe
34,jeremycrimsonfox,This Movie Does Not Have The Power,2,21 July 2019,"Yeah, I am with the people who hate this film. While the actors do a good job with their roles (especially Doplh as He-Man and Frank Langella as the most sinister Skeletor known to man), and having a good soundtrack, the story was lame. While the idea of He-Man on Earth was interesting (as in the Filmation cartoon, his mother, Queen Marlena, is from Earth), sadly, it gets hijacked by Julie, a teenage orphan, and her keyboard-playing boyfriend, Kevin, who become the one that have to help He-Man get back. Also, there's Gwildor, who is basically the movie's Orko, only not funny enough, and Skeletor's soldiers, who are basically a rip-off of the Stormtroopers from Star Wars. This movie is just a bad attempt to help Mattel sell more action figures.",Masters of the Universe

Along the way two annoying kids tag along with our heroes for a (boring) match between good and evil. Masters Of The Universe can be seen as two things. 1)It can be seen as how little creativity and life goes into products made for children. 2)It can be seen as a low point for all involved. (Yes even Dolph Lundgren) The special effects are okay but hardly impressive and the bad guys are straight from the Star Wars replicant store.

36,one9eighty,I have the power... to award this 7 out of 10,7,16 August 2018,"I first watched this film in the 80's, as a child who was already a big fan of the franchise. I enjoyed the cartoon and I had a lot of the action figures and other toys. When I saw the film I was as happy as I was disappointed, before I go into that, and provide a review, let me tell you something about the film.A long time ago in a distant galaxy (sound familiar?), evil Skeletor (Frank Langella) is mounting an attack on Castle Greyskull, a fortress of goodness and power supreme. The castles protector, the Sorceress Christina Pickles), has been captured by Skeletor, and only He-Man (Dolph Lundgren), the sorceress's champion and defender of good could save the day. He-Man is currently fighting his way to the castle with the help of Man-at-Arms (Duncan) (Jon Cyper), and his daughter, Teala (Chelsea Field) - head of the kings guard. On the way to the castle they have an accidental meeting with Gwildor (Billy Barty), an inventor and locksmith. His invention, a cosmis key, has allowed Skeletor the advantage in his attack on Castle Greyskull, Skeletor is hunting him to prevent him from inventing something to rival the original invention, little does Skeletor know, he's already made a duplicate key. A fight ensues, and in order to save themselves; Gwildor uses the cosmic key and opens a gateway, taking the good guys to Earth. In order to return to Eternia, the good guys have to work with native Earthlings - Julie (Courtney Cox) and Kevn (Robert Duncan-McNeil), while trying to stop them; Skeletor has opened a gate too and sends his henchmen. Can He-Man and his friends get back to Eternia and prevent Skeletor from becoming the master of the universe? So then, first of all this is a decent fantasy - if you forget that the characters are based on cartoons, which are ultimately based on toys. The plot isn't that taxing or complex which makes it easy for a younger audience to follow, which will be run of the mill though, and familiar to older audiences. Other than Dolph Lundgren's acting as He-Man, the rest of the cast are conceivable and deliver well - notable mention to James Tolkan as Detective Lubic for playing a wise cracking hardened detective well. The choreography is generally quite cheesy and predictable, but it doesn't look stupid. The musical score by Bill Conti is actually really good, and Gary Goddard as director manages to push the film thematically and as a motion picture spectacle in a decent direction. The problems arise when you have a vested interest as a fan. I remember sitting in the theater thinking that He-Man didn't look right or sound right, the other characters didn't look or sound right, some characters and technology were made up for the film and didn't previously exist, and some were completely omitted. There were Stormtrooper like armies that Skeletor commanded (new and made up), there were characters missing such as Orco and Battlecat (albeit, these two would have been hard to execute as CGI character in the 80's). In fact, it's fair to say, the characters and places which did exist originally were just name sakes rather than a filmatic duplicate of what fans had come to expect. Writing all this makes me sound like an old fanboy with a chip on his shoulder about this film, but I truly enjoy it, maybe it's just nostalgia that drives that enjoyment but it's definitely not the worst film ever. To summarise, if you like fantasy films that look like a cross between Star Wars and Flash Gordon with a twist of Back to the Future technology, then you'll find some enjoyment in this. I've got to give it 7 out of 10, because ""I have the power""... to award it that much ;) Enjoy!",Masters of the Universe
37,jhclues,He-Man Has the Power!,7,9 November 2001,"It's a classic confrontation between good and evil, and a struggle to save the Universe from the dark side, when a villain rises up and threatens all who oppose him with slavery or destruction in the 1987 offering `Masters of the Universe,' directed by Gary Goddard.  The evil Skeletor (Frank Langella) has captured the good Sorceress of Castle Greyskull (Christina Pickles) and is awaiting the moment when the Moon is at it's zenith, at which time he will be able to absorb all the powers of the cosmos and become Master of the Universe and omnipotent Ruler of their land, Eternia.  But everything is not yet right; though he has the Sorceress in his clutches, his formidable opponent and champion of the people, the indomitable He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) is still at large, and Skeletor knows he must bring him to his knees if he is to succeed.  Besides which, the `Cosmic Key' that will make it all possible for him is not yet in his possession.  So his task is two-fold:  He must enslave He-Man and find the Cosmic Key in order to effect his plans. And the secret of the Key lies with the peaceable locksmith and inventor, Gwildor (Billy Barty), a trusting soul, who betrayed by the beautiful Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster) has gone into hiding.  Now it's up to He-Man to foil Skeletor and save Eternia and the Universe from his unscrupulous grasp and restore power to the Sorceress and Castle Greyskull.	Though the make-up, costumes and special F/X are a bit cheesy, and overall the acting is bad, Goddard has put together a movie that is fun and exciting, and by lightening up on the menace has made it accessible to the whole family, including the younger set-- and, of course, since it's based on the children's animated TV series, it's just what you would expect, or should I say, hoped for, going in.  Goddard moves it all along at a crisp pace, never allowing it to get bogged down unnecessarily, and the ideals and principles to which the story adheres-- loyalty, honesty, trust, love of family-- all make this a worthwhile endeavor and a film to embrace.  Call it a poor man's `Star Wars' (from which it draws heavily, with the plethora of laser blasts and the ersatz `storm troopers' of Skeletor's army); the scale, perhaps, is not nearly as grand, but the sense of adventure and the overall feeling of Lucas's monumental film are certainly present.	Hidden behind the bony skull mask, Langella brings Skeletor to life with flair, successfully conveying the evil at the core of his soul.  This is a creature cloaked in darkness, ruthless and intimidating, effectively sinister, but less daunting than say, Darth Vader.  He's scary, but it's not a character that's going to drive the little ones out of the room shrieking in terror.  Langella makes him a fun kind of evil presence, which keeps it upbeat and creates the necessary sense of evil without taking the viewer to the brink of despair or bad dreams.  It allows that unsettling feeling within an atmosphere of hope, and the realization that in the end all will be well in Eternia.  It's a strong performance by Langella, and without question the best in the movie.	Another good performance is turned in by Meg Foster, as Evil-Lyn, Skeletor's right-hand woman.  Like Langella, Foster manages to convey evil without too much menace, and few actors have such absorbing, riveting eyes, which she uses to great effect here.  With her flowing cape, meaningful stride and a glance from those mesmerizing eyes, Foster makes Evil-Lyn a force to be reckoned with; she's a formidable opponent for He-Man, and one of the most memorable characters of the film.	As He-Man, Lundgren certainly looks the part, which is no doubt what put him in the role to begin with.  But can he act?  Let's just say this is a fantasy, and as such, what Lundgren brings to the part is good enough.  When he raises his sword and exclaims, `I have the power!' it's a rush; He-Man lives-- embodied by Dolph Lundgren, and for this movie, it works.	Fans of the TV series `Friends' will be interested in seeing the young Courteney Cox (twenty-three when this movie was filmed) here in her motion picture debut.  As Julie Winston, a high school girl who unwittingly gets drawn into the fray, she comports herself well enough, though her performance is a far cry from anything that would earn an Oscar nomination. She does make Julie believable, however, which is the important thing. Again, this is a fantasy, and as such it doesn't take a lot to keep you in the story.  Suffice to say that Cox has come a long way since making this one.	James Tolkan, on the other hand, does not fare as well as some of the others here.  A talented character actor, he nevertheless gives an embarrassingly bad performance as Detective Lubic.  A stereotype if ever there was one, Tolkan still can't seem to get a handle on who Lubic is or where he fits in.  This is a role just about any actor could've walked through without missing a beat, but Tolkan manages to muck it up so badly he becomes a distraction at times.  It may have been a case of trying to make too much out of something that simply wasn't intended to be anything other than what it was; and it's understandable that as an actor Tolkan would want to make the most of what he was given.  In this case, however, it was unnecessary, and just didn't work.	The supporting cast includes Jon Cypher (Man-at-Arms), Robert Duncan McNeill (Kevin) and Barry Livingston (Charlie).  Enjoyable family fare, `Masters of the Universe' may not be the best movie of all time, but it is what it is and offers a fun and satisfying evening's entertainment.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.",Masters of the Universe
38,phubbs,Masters of the Universe,3,19 November 2014,"Oh my how delicious is this piece of 80's panto, some of the best badly adapted hokey nonsense I've seen, yet somehow its so damn good.Where to start! this really is your typical fantasy film of the era, every cliché every funny little niche is here as you would expect and the funny thing is it was actually meant to be a blockbuster. I have since found out there were many problems in creating this film and it does show some what, the film is really nothing like the original He-Man cartoon in any way.Effects wise this sorta stumbles through with some interesting ideas, some of the makeup is actually quite good, Skeletor, Beast Man and Saurod all have pretty nice makeup appliances and costumes which fit the He-Man universe. Other effects are laughably terrible with some awful bluescreen work, nasty models of which most seem ripped straight outta 'Star Wars', faded poor laser blast effects and some of the most hilariously bad stunts and fight choreography you will see. Most kicks and punches clearly (and I mean CLEARLY) don't make their intended contacts.The cast are actually a mix of decent character actors which is the funny thing, some of these performances saved the film and gave it cult status. Of course Langella as Skeletor is the co de gra of cheesy villains with his snarling voice and bellowing cries lusting for power. For me the best and most amusing performance was James Tolkan as the no nonsense cop Lubic with his sharp tongue, gotta love that guy and his baldness.Along for the ride is steady character actor Jon Cypher, fantasy actor regular Billy Barty, Meg Foster as the quite sexual Evil-Lyn in her lovely tight barbarian-esq outfit with luscious lips (oh yeah!) and last of all Courtney Cox, yes THAT Courtney Cox of 'Friends' fame and as you would expect she's still annoying as hell even back then. So yes the film is practically a joke with its Punch and Judy style and completely awful effects, fights etc...but it has gained a lot of notoriety for just that. Even when I saw this back as a kid I knew the film bared no resemblance to the original material, it always bewildered me why the creators thought to create new bad guys when there were so many rich villains to use, who the hell was Blade, Karg and Saurod suppose to be? where was Trap Jaw Tri-Klops Mer-Man or Man-E-Faces? the same could be said for the heroes also. Then there was the question of who on Earth were all these stormtrooper type foot soldiers clad in black armour that were an idea rip from so many films!?.I have since found out they were stuck in so He-Man could kill things without becoming too violent for the kids as He-Man wasn't suppose to kill. I can see that now but it still doesn't work right does it, I can't believe Lucas never sued frankly even with the almost identical ending to 'ROTJ'.Its funny to look back and laugh, even more so to think films like this actually made it to the cinema and were meant to be big money spinners. I actually love how the film just goes off on its own tangent completely ignoring the source material, its so far gone its brilliant in such a bad way. Gotta love Skeletor's golden coloured horned silver foil battle mask getup when he transforms at the end which seems to be a rip off from 'Big Trouble in Little China'! the way Tolkan swears oh and the fact Teela seems to be wearing a thin thong if you look closely as well, kids film?.Wanna give it a good score because its just so poor its good, but really I can't...end of the day it is purely sh*t.3.5/10",Masters of the Universe
39,The_Movie_Cat,Shameless Tripe!,3,21 March 2001,"If you were going to produce a children's action-fantasy movie would you really risk your money by casting as the lead a man with the charisma of a bag of sugar?Having said that, Dolph ""even Keanu has a greater screen presence"" Lundgren does try really hard, and is still miles better than his dreadful co-stars, Frank Langella excepted. Jon Cypher is particularly uninspiring as Man-at-Arms. Maybe they make films like this to take it easy on the Oscar Academy. Based on a popular cartoon series/toy figure range, the film naturally expands its audience by downplaying the more eccentric (expensive?) looking characters (We get Teela but not Orco or Ram-Man, Evil-Lyn but not Triclops or TrapJaw) and setting the vast majority of it on Earth. This cheap scrimping even writes out the popular Battle Cat. New character Gwildor (Billy Barty) has two dual functions - one is as blatant plot device and font of all exposition, the other is to irritate you s***less.Being derived from an already pretty vapid cartoon series, the film even blands it out further, with a mawkish, tritely sentimental end and a predictable plot. ""It's not her you want, it's me. It's always been between us,"" says He-Man (Dolph) to Skeletor (Langella) at one point. While 'tor, for his part, wants He-Man kneeling before him with his chest stripped bare. No wonder they're aggressive to one another - it's an unrequited homo scenario going on here.The generic movie takes everything it can from the genre. The opening theme and titles so want to be Superman you almost pity them, while Skeletor's opening march is straight out of Star Wars - and that's just the first five minutes. Only decent moment is a quick blast of Purple Haze, though as it's used as character shorthand to pretend that nerdy Barry Livingstone is a cool heavy metal store owner even that holds little comfort. Look out too for the incessant product placement for Burger King.Although the plot is simple, not to say microscopic, the execution leaves it all a little confused. Combine this with a romantic subplot involving an 80s-style Courtney Cox and some of the most feeble comic setpieces ever laid to celluloid and you're looking pretty grim. Add to this disinterested direction, cheap-looking design and a witless script and what's left is a noisy, worthless (and violent) dirge. Yet it's still better than Power Rangers. Well... just. 3/10.",Masters of the Universe
40,Maziun,Somewhat charming cheesy fantasy movie about toys,3,31 August 2016,"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe toys were quite a big hit in the 80's. There is a rumor that He-Man toys were the results of an unsuccessful attempt to market a line of Conan toys and that they only gave him a blonde wig . Anyway , Mattel (the producer of toys) approached Filmation studio to develop an animated TV series out of the toy line. The cartoon aired from 1983 to 1985. Filmation created most of the supporting characters in the mythology, which Mattel then turned around and developed as toys. As you can see the whole show was basically a cynical extended commercial that was being marketed under the guise of entertainment. To be honest the cartoon is a epic hybrid of fantasy and sci-fi, with ancient castles and sorcerers mixing with laser guns and cyborgs. A good potential for interesting movie. ""Masters of the universe"" movie was made when the popularity of the cartoon and toys was starting to fade. This was not He-Man's first big-screen release. In 1985, the animated film ""The Secret of the sword"" was released theatrically.""MOTU"" obviously tries to follow in the footsteps of ""Star wars"". The real uncredited source for the film is surely Jack Kirby's ""Orion of the New Gods"" (1971-1977) comic-book from which all the elements have been taken. Director Gary Goddard tried to dedicate the film to American comic book artist Jack Kirby in the closing credits , but the studio took the credit out. The film has also been stripped of much of the mythology of the animated series. Many viewers reviewed the motion picture in comparison to the cartoon, when it really was an adaptation of the toys only.This is one of bigger budget movies made by Golan - Globus , yet disappointingly because of budget restrains most of the action happens on contemporary Earth . Eternia appears at beginning and ending of the movie , mostly works as a backdrop. Thankfully the costumes and sets are superb . The special effects still hold up pretty well. The music by Bill Conti is good , even if it rip offs ""Superman"".The action is OK . I really liked the final battle between He-man and Skeletor , the flying hover craft and the junk yard battle. At least you can clearly see here what's going on , not unlike modern action movies.The screenplay is rather poor. There is no real introduction to the characters , because the movie is aimed at the cartoon and toy fans . The characters are paper-thin , one dimensional at best. The fish-out-of-water aspect of story doesn't really work , the humor is VERY lame. There are some terribly dumb moments in this movie (the ""I'm your mother"" scene for example). A little too much time is spent on the soap-opera angle of Julie and Kevin. Dialogues are terribly simplistic. The overall plot is predictable as hell. There is nice extra scene that was supposed to set the stage for the sequel ""Masters of the Universe 2"", but since the film didn't do very well at the Box Office, the sequel was dropped. The script for ""Masters of the Universe 2"" had been written, but was rewritten and became the script for the 1989 Jean-Claude Van Damme sci-fi action film ""Cyborg"".Dolph Lundgren (""Rocky 4 "") looks EXACTLY like He-man , althrough his acting is almost non-existent. Lundgren had only limited acting experience, a thick Swedish accent, and was not yet fluent in English during filming. He needed a speech-coach AND a drama-coach to make this movie. The real star however is Frank Langella (""Frost/Nixon""). He took the role of Skeletor because he wanted to do it for his son Alex, whom was a fan of He-Man and Langella had felt Skeletor was a role he couldn't refuse. Frank Langella admitted in an interview that Skeletor was his favorite role. He wrote some of his lines, like: ""Tell me about the loneliness of good, He-Man. Is it equal to the loneliness of evil ?"". His performance is honestly great , very theatrical and fun. Courtney Cox (TV sitcom ""Friends"") is bland as Julie . Christina Pickles as the Sorceress is awful . Meg Foster (""They live"") as Evil-Lynn is nice. James Tolkan (""Back to the future"") tries to bring some humor as police detective , but can't do much with weak dialogue. Overall , for a toy commercial this is not that bad movie . Just accept the silliness and go with it . Give it a chance on lazy afternoon. It's not really good , but charming and innocent. For a movie about toys this is FAR superior than ""Transformers"". I give it 3/10.",Masters of the Universe

I love this movie cause it reminds me of all the he-man figures that I used to play with when I was a child.  The story of this film is loosely based on the story from the cartoon series.  I say loosely, because other than the names of some of the people (He-Man, Man-At-Arms, Teela, Skeletor, Beast Man) and the names of some of the places (Castle Grayskull, Snake Mountain, Eternia), the two stories don't seem to have a whole lot in common.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, although, it was sad that some of the key/favorite characters from the cartoon series didn't make it into the film.  It would have been cool to see Battle-Cat in the film, although very hard to execute.  I think a lot of people would have liked to see Orco too...but I never liked him much anyway, so that was just fine with me to cut him out.  As for the cast, I thought they were actually pretty good.  It seems most people disliked Dolph Lundgren playing He-Man, but I thought he was great! No, he's not the best actor in the world, but I thought he did a fine job. I really enjoyed seeing Courteney Cox in her early work, and at such a young age, she was quite the looker back then too.  As for Frank Langella (Skeletor), I thought he did a great job with the role!  And I thought his make-up was incredible!  Very good job!  I thought the rest of the cast did a great job too.  People that deserve a special mention is Bill Barty (Gwildor), James Tolkan (Det. Lubic) and Chelsea Field (Teela).  The only major complaint about the movie that I have is why did they have to kill off Sarod and not Karg?  Saurod was cool looking and Karg was just plain stupid.  He talked stupid, he looked stupid, his clothes were stupid...all around stupid!  Saurod was cool!  Anyway, in a strictly movie sense, this movie isn't really very good, and if you don't know anything about He-Man, then are almost sure to dislike it. But in a nostalgic sort of way, the movie is pretty cool.  Also, you have to keep in mind that this IS a kid's movie, so it's not really intended to be anything really mind-blowing.  Nonetheless, I loved the movie!  I hope you like the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",Masters of the Universe

Naturally, much greatness was expected from the motion picture adaptation of ""Masters of the Universe"". Oh, what grandness would await us! Lundgren seemed perfect for the role of the kid-friendly, ""blond version of Conan the Barbarian"". This film would be bigger than ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" (had we known about this one back then) combined! Just think of the myriads of creatures from the toy-line, Trap-Jaw, Battle-Cat and all the others.Well, there was no Battle-Cat. No Trap-Jaw. No Man-E-Faces, no Mer-Man you get my point. Instead, we got a couple of new creatures; we got annoying teenagers that could only exist in 1980's Americana and, of course, Charlie, the most pointless character in the annals of cinema.

And the movie committed one faux-pas that was common for productions with a limited budget: it took the setting to contemporary settings (that's 80s Los Angeles, to you and me).This review may sound negative, having so far pointed out mainly the short-comings, but not all is bad: Frank Langella makes a wonderful Skeletor, who obviously enjoys hamming it up to 11; Meg Foster was born to play Evil-Lyn and, as mentioned, Lundgren was a very convincing He-Man, even though there really was no need for that cape. Though the absence of all the characters like Stratos and Zodiac was painful, the new 'creatures' Sauron (not related), Blade (not related either but one of the movie's highlights) and Gwildor (as obnoxious as the cartoon-Orko, but made a better toy) were very well designed and performed.So, all that's left is to wait and dream of a remake, that probably will never materialize – unless of course the toy-line is revived one day and a remake is turned into some kind of CGI-monster-production (a crate of beer says, it will be in 3-D).If this movie would have had a bigger budget and would have stuck closer to the original story, it could have worked. As it is, the flaws outnumber the merits, and giving 5 points from 10 is plain fair.",Masters of the Universe

MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE when it's HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE. That's one, two He-Man and Skeletor's outfit are all wrong. He-Man wasn't born He-Man, it's a super hero name, his parents didn't look at him and said, ""Let's call him He-Man."" No, that didn't happened. He-Man's secret identity is Prince Adam of the city Etnernia. Secondly, Skeletor has no lips, they could have passed on the star power considering you have no idea who it is behind the make-up. Next, this was based on a cartoon and it's way too violent for He-Man, he doesn't go around killing people. The two things they got right, Man-At-Arms was pretty good and so was Evil-Lyn. The next thing they did wrong is were is Battle Cat, they could have made it a puppet. But no, they didn't have the nerve to dye a tiger. With the right company of dye wouldn't hurt the tiger. The sorceress transforms into Zoar the Falcon, no crystals.

50,supertom-3,One of my fave films ever!!,9,15 January 2003,"Like many people of my sort of age bracket, when I was younger I was obsessed with He-man, the cartoons, toys and whatever else. When this came out, I was understandably very excited. Never have I felt the same excitement about a film as I did when this came out.Of course the film is by no means a classic. It was a relatively high budget by mid eighties standards, being 17 million. This was still fairly cheap in terms of recreating the worlds of Masters of the Universe, hence most of it was set on Earth as opposed to Eternia. Other gripes would be, no Orco, no battle cat but He Man purists could go on. The changes that the designers made were generally well recieved. The darker more gothic look with the costumes, I thought He Mans costume was really good.The cast are good. Dolph Lundgren is perfectly cast as He-man on the physical side of things, and for his debut he isn't half bad, he's good hero material and his physical exploits make up for his lack of acting ability. He has however improved immensely since this movie and I have been a Dolph fan since, thanks mainly to the fact that he portrayed my childhood hero. Meg Foster is excellent and strangely sexy as Evil Lynn and James Tolkan is as usual very good too, but it is Frank Langellas superbly evil performance as Skelator. Skelator gets all the best lines and Langella revels in his role, with his performance shining through heavy make up.
The sets that have been built are good, particularly Greyskulls interior, which at the time was one of the largest sets ever built. This is all harmless and camp fun with a superbly uplifting musical score from Bill Conti and despite not being a very good film in the critical sense it is fun and I love it. 9/10",Masters of the Universe
51,bh_tafe3,Fun 80s schlock for a rainy afternoon,6,25 January 2016,"Of all the things to admire about Frank Langella, and there are many, one of the more obscure is that his role here, as the villain Skeletor, is one of his favourites. Here's man who's been nominated for Oscars, been picky with the roles he's selected over a long career, and one of his favourite roles was playing a masked Shakespearean villain in a movie made on the cheap for kids that few people saw. Gotta respect that.So let's go back in time to the 1980s, and He-Man, subtle homosexual overtones and all, was King of Cartoon Land. ""I have the POWER!!!"" If you were young at the time, you know exactly what I'm talking about. So it was only a matter of time before a Hollywood studio got hold of the property and made a movie. Enter Cannon Films, makers of such masterpieces as Superman 4, The (ex)Terminator, and The Happy Hookers, to try and milk this cash cow.As the hero of the film we have Dolph Lundgren, just off the boat from Sweden and speaking his lines phonetically. And that will make a lot of his performance in this make sense. Poor guy literally has no idea what he's saying. He-Man is trying to save the kingdom of Eternia from Skeletor (Langella) who's forces have captured the Sorceress of Gray-Skull (Christina Pickles-nice name). Old Skull boy wants to take the Sorcerer's power and add it to his own while making some awesome Shakespearean monologues to his henchmen. To make matters worse Grinners has also stolen the mysterious ""cosmic key"" off a Dark Crystal reject. The key enables Skels to travel wherever he wants to in the Universe by playing a tune, which makes me wonder where he will end up if he plays Sweet Dreams by the Eurhythmics. Luckily He-Man is able to steal the key, and not wanting to get his ass kicked by the baddies at Castle Gray-Skull (including Evil-Lyn, played by Meg Foster, who I really need to introduce somewhere in this plot summary) He-Man and some offsiders cosmically leg it to Earth. Joining He-Man we have Man-at-Arms (a likable turn from Jon Cypher) his daughter Teela (Chelsea Field-The Last Boyscout), and the afore mentioned Dark Crystal reject Gwildor (Billy Barty, Nope, me neither).Once on earth they lose the key and it's found by Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeil of Star Trek Voyager fame) who thinks it's some darn fangle new Synthesizer. He has a girlfriend Julie (Courtney Cox) and eventually they get sucked into the main plot as the Laughing Langella and his forces come to earth to retrieve the key. Also dragged along is Detective Lubic (James Tolkan, the Principal from the Back to the Future films) and they all end up in Eternia to listen to another Langella monologue and eventually see He-Man save the Sorceress and kick Skeletor's ass.This movie is made on the cheap, and has a star who literally doesn't know what he's doing, or saying, or what anyone is saying to him. But what it does have aside from that is a surprising amount of fun. And I don't mean laughing at the movie, though there is certainly opportunity to do that in spades, but I mean the type of fun that is just you, as the viewer, enjoying yourself watching these guys. Front and centre of the enjoyment is Langella who relishes the opportunity to use his theatre training to run off on some truly glorious monologues. But I like a lot of the minor players in this too O'Neill and Cox get into this, as does Cypher. Foster, who apparently was sweltering in her costume for most of the filming, gives a perfectly acceptable portrayal of a villainess/ evil lackey.Masters of the Universe has a hero and a story who, apart from the homo-erotic subtext, are far removed from the cartoon. It's cheap, and obviously so, and has a lead actor giving a performance that has to be seen to be believed. It's no surprise at all that it bombed, and bombed huge. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy this. This is the type of film that, if you were switching through channels on your TV on a rainy afternoon, you could put on and be pleasantly diverted, and sometimes that's all a movie needs to be. By no means Masterful, but hardly embarrassing. Ultimately, to summarise: not good, but it'll do.",Masters of the Universe
52,deepfrieddodo,Exactly As You Might Expect,6,16 March 2021,"An unbelievably cheesy film, which is objectively not very good, but still really enjoyable. From the start it feels like the entire thing is going to be cringeworthy, but it really builds and genuinely draws you in until the end. Although Lundgren as He-Man is the lead, it is not a one-man show, screen time is split fairly equally across half a dozen characters and it never feels like there is a true central character.A victim of 80s special effects (which are truly awful), taccy costume choices bar a few (I'm looking at you Saurod, who looks brilliant) and poor make up (Skeletor's skull is very fleshy), these things all eventually add into the atmosphere and support the enjoyment. The costumes actually grow on you, although some remain downright daft. Acting isn't too great, and there really isn't any comic relief which is odd for this kind of film, but it's entertaining until the end. Stick with it, but don't expect too much.",Masters of the Universe
53,TheHande,Very enjoyable,7,2 December 2005,"People who call this movie a Star Wars rip-off have not seen Episode III. At least two lines spoken by Palpatine are ripped directly from this movie and the mouth of Skeletor. Anyway...I don't wanna get in to how this thing relates to the cartoon because frankly, it doesn't. You watch a Dolph Ludgren movie for the same reasons you watch a Schwartzenegger or Van Damme film. Not because of good articulation, but because of the immediate coolness factor.There's no hiding the fact that the movie was low-budget, but regardless the special-effects were quite crisp and I personally didn't mind taking the action to earth since this time around they avoided any residual corniness you tend to get with films like this. Of course there's always the risk of getting the wrong type of comic-relief, but I liked Gwildor so I don't care.If there's something about this movie I didn't like it has to be two things: 1.) Teela's diminished role 2.) Blade's lack of screen-timeOther than that, this is one excellent adventure.",Masters of the Universe
54,swedzin,Two words: Frank Langella.,6,25 May 2016,"So, this precious little gem, from the 80s, still remains a special gem in our minds. First of all, let me be clear, this is movie is bad, not the worst, but really bad and campy. I don't know how Cannon pictures took over the rights for this film, and how no other well-known, or larger studio didn't take the rights of something so popular. Really, He-Man and Masters of the Universe were quite popular and favorite show for kids (and to mention all that toys sales), but was it a good idea? Was it necessary? Even for the 80s?Now, the budget was ridiculously low, and the movie did not worked well at box office, but it has, even today, a loyal cult following. The story is funny, it's just a movie adaptation of some typical (not exactly) episode about a cosmic key that is wanted by Skeletor. Now, the story and directing, including script are cheesy, meant for kids of course, but when you get older, you realize how dumb that clichéd that was. They did not follow the original idea entirely, the characters do not look too much as themselves from the original TV show, they did not even put their original super powers, or special abilities, He-Man doesn't even have his Battle cat. So, that makes things disappointing. The acting is ridiculous, except maybe for Meg Foster and of course Frank Langella I'll talk about him soon enough. I have to admit that Dolph Lundgren was a pretty good choice for He- Man, but, the guy can't act, and he looks pretty much older and they never referred to him as ""Adam"". Meg Foster was good as Evil-Lyn and I think she was a good choice and she put some of her charm and poisonous sexiness to her character I vouch for her. This was one of the first major roles of Courtney Cox, thought she did not tried that much, nor her character was all that developed. Her boyfriend Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeill) was just ridiculous. Other actors as James Tolkan (who played a cliché detective who waits his retirement), Neil Cypher (Man at Arms was not that special) was solid, Chelsea Field (Teela was not that much developed also, she was there to look good in her tight white battle-armor ). I think that supporting actors as Bill Barty (who played Gwildor) was good. Though I also think that they made up this character, because they didn't have a budget for Orko. And also Anthony Longinus was good as Blade, though he could do more fighting scenes with his character.Now, for Frank Langella what to say Everyone who studies acting, want to become an actor, or is already an accomplished actor must swear to Langella's performance here. I think that Langella saved this film. He was easily the best actor in the film. So this is a prime example of good actor, overshadowing all other actors. He just steals the entire show and he was glad about it, because his sons wanted him to play Skeletor. And look at him, that is the actor who had so much fun with his character and that would be a good advice to other actors just have fun with it. Just like for example Raul Julia in Street Fighter (1994).The costumes and make up were not entirely bad, but the costumes could have been better. They could make them to identify more with the TV show characters. The costumes of Skeletor's storm troopers were too generic too usual. The interior and exterior of planet Eternia was bad it was just bad and unimaginative So most of the scenes were filmed on earth. There are also people who thinks that this movie has gay overtones and make jokes about it Really, some people can't notice something far more important in the film Overall, I do recommend this gem, because it's a good, family fun, of course not to take for granted. And, yes watch after credits.",Masters of the Universe
55,gareth-75442,"HA HA HA, this was bad when released in 87",5,23 August 2020,"Everything about this movie is awful, it was terrible on release in 87 & it's terrible now, awful script, B list TV actors with 0 acting ability, it's only claim to fame is the casting of Frank Langella & Meg Foster.
Hard to belive that 10 years after Star Wars set the standard for sci-fi fantasy this pile of junk got greenlighted with a budget double of star wars at $22 million.
Only a handful of the characters from the original worldwide successful cartoon makes it into the movie together with a whole bunch of star wars castoff ""stormtroopers"" painted black.
But let's be fair here, turning a cheesy kids cartoon like HE-MAN into a successful live action movie was always going to be near impossible, especially when the source material has very little depth to it, the cartoon was basically an ad to sell the numerous action figures.
Sony has had a planned reboot in existence since 2000 but has had constant delays, the latest rumour is for March 2021 but a theatrical release isn't on the cards, instead a release thru a streaming service is more likely with Netflix being the preferred way to go.",Masters of the Universe
56,David_Frames,Good Journey?,6,29 September 2003,"A twisted exercise in wish fulfilment and post-bereavement fantasy in which Courtney Cox gets a chance to resurrect her dead parents killed in an air crash one year previously, aided by extra-terrestrial warriors whom have dominion over time and space. Director Gary Goddard fashions a disturbing dissection of grief and guilt in which Cox's Julie constructs a hyper-real fantasy world - an uneasy profusion of pop cultural artifacts (Star Wars, Children's Dolls and Action Figures) and the symbolic projection of repressed desire, particularly with regard to the device of the 'cosmic key'. It is both a literally employed narrative device to allow the visitation from Eternia, the alien world of Julie's dreams, and the restoration of her family in whose death she feels complicit but facilitates structures of fantasy in which Julie's need for escapism from her grief and the ability to alter the past become manifest in technology. The technology doesn't exist of course hence the need for Cox to invent her otherworldly heroes but also we become aware of the need the Cox character has to address the role that transport technology played in her parents death. Just as the plane killed them and blew their fragile bodies into millions of blooded and metal infused bits, David Odel's script suggests that an even more advanced instrument of transport can bring them back to life. The visitors themselves are supermen and animal like creatures, perfectly divided into easily coded forms of good and evil and subsequently a complexed play of light and dark is played out between 'He-Man' and Skeletor' in which the character's narcissistic identification with the conflicting emotions she feels surrounding her guilt complex are personified in an on screen war between these alien visitors. This might be an easy enough paradigm from which to judge the thematic and formal conventions employed in Masters of the Universe but the film itself provides more questions than it answers. What are we to make of the boyfriend Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeil) who is viciously beaten by the 'beast man'? As the narrative takes place in Cox's mind, characterisations of friends and partners are unreliable. McNeil is an idealised conception of ideal partner who is of course an extension of her dead father, namely supportive, loyal and alive. His vicious beating however suggests that in the midst of her catharsis revenge fantasies are being played out, the beast man the personification of rage and barely concealed contempt. The only conclusion is that McNeil's boyfriend has beaten his girlfriend in reality and probably subjected her to indecent sex acts and psychological torture. If his on screen personality is an idealised opposite then in reality he has propagated the notion that Julie killed her parents by choosing not to go to the lake with them that weekend. Furthermore the decaying father made flesh, i.e Skeletor (Frank Langella) compounds this notion by punishing her culminating in a physical attack that recalls the spectre of rotting decrepitude in her parent's burnt corpses. Ultimately then this is a children's film in which death, torture and suffering walk hand in hand with schizophrenic hallucination and Bill Conti. It's either the greatest diatribe on loss in modern cinema or an offensive mish mash of half-baked psychological projection and the Reganite culture of fear. Which is it? You decide.Some good special effects.",Masters of the Universe

He-Man was a hugely popular cartoon in the 80's and when it was announced the were making a movie version of it many a kid must have been very excited to see it at the cinema. The result sadly is a bit average, first of all the action takes place on Earth for 90 per cent of the movie. It would have worked so much better if they kept it on He-Mans home world of Etarnia. Also a very popular character from the cartoon ""Orco"" was missing and replaced by a slightly annoying little creature called Gwildor played by the great Billy Barty. Both of these decisions were due to budget problems (this movie was made by Cannon films after all) but a Kid who was a huge fan of the cartoon is bound to be slightly annoyed at this. Still credit where credit is due they certainly tried to offer up a big Star Wars type spectacle but it didn't quite work out.

This movie is a brilliant blend of science fiction and fantasy, right up George Lucas' alley.  I swear, he could have written and directed this.  I think I liked this movie better than ""Phantom Menace"" and the effects and sets in the movie look fine!

64,KillerLord,How Should One Judge This?,5,14 September 2008,"How does one start judging a movie that is based on a comic book or a cartoon? Do we actually judge it on the basis of the original characters and the original story line? Or do we judge it as a stand-alone completely independent of what we already know about the characters? Well, the fact that the name of the movie and the characters in it are based on some existing characters, then I guess I would prefer judging it based on what I know about the world as it exists in the original story lines! In that case, the movie is a perfect disappointment. None of what you know about the original characters strikes you when you see this movie. You see He-Man and you feel that for sure Dolph Lundgren is a nice selection but when you see him holding a laser gun in his hands and uses a hovercraft to move around, you know for sure that he is not the He-Man you read about in the comic books or admired as a child in the cartoons. No way! And it was a shock for me too. The last thing I expected to see in the motion picture based on He-Man and his world was to see these characters so weirdly dressed, using all kinds of gadgets that best belong to a Star War kind of a movie. There would have been one way of making this movie better. One could change the names of all the characters in the movie. This way, nobody would walk into the movie hall with expectations of this movie being about He-Man. I must confess at this point that I am not a geek in the sense that I have read and seen all there is about He-Man but at the same time I can assure I know enough to conclude that this movie definitely is not a good He-man movie. Well, now forgetting for a while that this movie is not to be judged based on the He-man universe, let us see how it stands out as a movie on its own. The special effects are decent and the story line is just about okay. The characters are not identifiable with and do not come with proper development. They are just there doing their role as the Alpha and the Omega. The story is okay in the sense that there is something in it and not pure action. There is a little plot. But again, it is not much deep. To sum it up, just see this movie once and forget about it.

I loved the old cartoon and toys when I was a kid, but this movie just does not have what it takes to be good in any way.First of all, the story is terrible. Bringing He-Man to the cheesy 80s United States was a major mistake that could not be overcome. I mean, where's Prince Adam and Eternia? All we ever see of Eternia are 8 guys in bad costumes looking up at a projection of Skeletor on a stage. The plots of the cartoons were actually totally superior (which is sad).Dolph Lungdren is big, but has absolutely no charisma as He-Man. The other characters are simply there for the sake of being there. There is no connection between characters that shows any emotion. Not so ironically the best acting comes from teenager Courtney Cox. She doesn't have good lines, but at least she comes across as sincere, which is a talent of hers.Evil-Lyn and Skeletor's mercenaries are completely wasted. Evil-Lyn does nothing other than continually walking onto scenes leading the drone troops.We don't get to know any of these characters. In one of the many ""what could have been"" moments, Evil-Lyn puts an electronic choker around the teen boy's neck. The director stays on a dumb side-angle two shot of the two of them, when a good director at that moment would have gotten close-ups of them or of the device. We could then have seen the fear in the boy's eyes, or the glimmer of evil in Evil-Lyn's. Finally, when we do see a close-up it is way too late to evoke any emotion at all - the moment has passed. I could go on and on about such similar moments, but this is what distinguishes good directors from bad. Do you think Spielberg would have missed that moment?Ultimately, the cheesy 80s decor, weak costumes, and awful opening titles also betray the film. Langella can't even save it with his hamming. It probably shouldn't have been made and came almost two years after He-Man's heyday of 1983-5. The effects were not able to do what was necessary and most of all, there are so many great characters from the toys and cartoons that are absent. Where's Stratos, Ram-Man, Trap-Jaw, Mer-Man, etc.???

However, the dumbos' decided to replace Orko with the hideous troll Gwildor (Billy Barty). The damn character is so freakin annoying. One of his lines is literally. "" The door! The door!""

The only thing standing in his way is the scantily clad, pec-packing, tiger steadless He-Man, played here by the Scantilynavian action star Dolphin Lundgealot.

It could be He-Man's beautiful blonde mullet that constantly reminds Skeletor that he has no follicles. Anyway, the plot... What sets things in motion is none other than a ginger dwarf with a warp whistle. With the exception of He-Man, there is no other tool that Skeletor would rather get his hands on. But Gwildworf, along with He-Man and friends take a cosmic cruise to the most boring part of Earth where they land in sub-bordemite America. Skeletor has his own personal army of Darth Vaders but he chooses instead to send a ""curious quartet"" of ass kickers to retrieve his precious. There's Blade who is a cross between Shredder and a pirate. Sarad, a reptilian relative of Mortal Kombat's Cyrax, I think. The Beastman who seems to have a bit of cowardly lion in him. Then there's Karg, imagine the Grinch had a baby with Joan Rivers and it came out with a silvery mane of hair and a desire to be an intergalactic Napoleon. Unfortunately, Skeletor's A-team get little chance to let their mercenary skills shine as He-man proves formidable. But the saga isn't over as Skeletor has more tricks up his sleeve. Watch it! Love it!",Masters of the Universe
68,Baldach,Courntney Cox and action figures,4,3 June 2002,"When watching this movie you have to remember that  1. HE-man action figures were hot items in 1983-86. 2. Remember that there was a successful He-Man and She-ra cartoon series for a few years.  3. but most important remember Courtney Cox was an up and coming actress trying to break into movies. Frankly, Courtney Cox trying to fight off the villians is the only reason to watch this movie. I quickly got tired of the half-troll elf that was in charge of the Cosmic Key, the sub-par make-up on the villians, and the Cosmic Key being  a ripoff of a musical keyboard.  The last two minutes of the movie has an interesting plot twist involving Courtney. Overall there are only three reasons to see this movie 1.  To see Courtney Cox before she became a TV star  2. To relive 80's toy fads 3. To see hot looking women like Courtney Cox.",Masters of the Universe
69,Skeletors_Hood,Great fun!,10,3 October 2001,"""I Have the Power!""For those of us who grew up in the 80's, that phrase is all too familiar. Especially for those who would rush home after school to watch our favorite strongman face off against the forces of evil that threaten the safety and security of his homeworld.  For my money, it was never better than when He-Man faced off against Skeletor for the struggle for Eternia.I also remember the fantasies that I and my friends would have of traveling away to that world of magic and fantasy, to fight alongside He-Man as he defends Grayskull.  It truly was a series that was out of this world.And now it's on Earth.When I first heard about a live action movie, (mind you, I was twelve at the time), I was overly excited about it.  But I didn't get to see it until my late teens.  And I must say that it was very well done, especially in its presentation.  In fact it brought back those far away childhood memories of those late afternoons in front of the tv, or outside with the toys a make-shift Eternia setting with my friends.I'll grant a few things that were wrong with the movie though.  There were times that I think the script was either badly edited, or just too rushed at certain points.  I'm also not thrilled about them being on earth, but understanding budget constraints and the idea to make these characters more real than fantasy help feed into that decision, so I let that one go.  I would have also liked to see more of the characters from the toys in the movie, but have no complaints that they made up a few cool characters, like Blade.The casting choices, I felt, were really good.  Dolph Lundgren worked as He-Man, even though he can't act.  He looked the part, and even pulled off the role.  I could tell that he wasn't walking through the part, as many actor will do with character roles (right Mr. Clooney?).  And Frank Langella the PERFECT choice for Skeletor.  Langella managed to bring that character to life in a way that gave me chills.  Skeletor is perhaps one of the greatest villains ever imagined, but the cartoon made him a cackling villain, who was more a buffoon than anything, therefore he didn't seem threatening.  But seeing Langella make Skeletor more dark and evil put my faith back into the conviction as a great villain.You don't have to be a die hard fan of the series to enjoy the movie.  It's great fun, imaginative, and it captures a moment in time.  Don't scrutinize the movie because it's different from the cartoon.  Look at it for what it is, and don't focus on its faults.  It had the power to recapture my imagination, so its not all that bad.",Masters of the Universe
70,The Spectacular Spider-Man,Awesome fantasy adventure,10,7 January 2001,"Just as some movies that should be great turn out to be awful, some movies that should be awful turn out to be great - Masters of the Universe. Unfortunately, for a film that's based on a cartoon that today's 20-somethings used to watch in the 1980's, none of the said 20-somethings are going to admit to liking it now. Few will give it a chance and realize the direction is good, the acting is good, the music is good, that it's exciting, funny, scary, suitably epic and absolutely action-packed and that it looks fantastic. But Superhero Cinema does. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe was a hugely successful mid-80's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The success of each fed the other, as well as a popular comicbook and loads of other merchandise. Finally in 1987 came the big one: the motion picture.What looks like suicide at first glance - converting a cartoon based on action figures into a full-length feature - gets more appealing when you look at thes ource material closer. The cartoon is a epic hybrid of fantasy and sci-fi, with ancient castles and sorcerers mixing with laser guns and cyborgs. It also has a very mythic feel, mixing Ancient Greece-era monsters and challenges with fairy tale locations.There are also hordes of exotic characters - warriors, mutants, monsters, magicians of every description, so the film makers could pick the coolest ones to bring to the screen. The ones they've chosen are He-Man and his arch enemy Skeletor (obviously), amazon-type female warrior Teela and her dad Man-At -Arms, the Sorceress of Grayskull, Skeletor's second in command Evil Lyn (which is always pronounced 'Evil-In'), and Beastman. Added to these are four characters that were created for the film - Gwildor, a dwarf-like inventor, Karg, a cross between Captain Hook and a bat, snake-like Sauron, and Blade, a sword and knife-obsessed slaphead. So that's eleven fantasy characters running about, which is a pretty good total.
Masters of the Universe succeeds because it takes the cartoon and adapts not it's superficial qualities, but it's essence into a movie, turning it into a mature sci-fi/fantasy adventure. This is where so many comic and cartoon based movies fail. They don't adapt their source material properly to make a successful feature film. You need to make the movie a natural progression from what it's based on, altering the look enough so it looks acceptable in real action, altering the characters into real people, choosing actors who can give real performances. It's not simply dressing superstars up as characters from a comic or cartoon, it's re-imagining the ideas as a movie. MotU does this perfectly. You can fault it as a film itself, of course, but you can't fault it as an adaption.The production design is superb, with some superbly realized sets and costumes. Everything has been adapted to look more realistic on the big screen. The cast give uniformly decent performances. Nobody lets the side down - these are all 3D characters, not cartoons. Dolph Lungren proves he's one of the European bodybuilder brigade who can act. Frank Langella gives an outstanding performance as Skeletor, his powerful presence almost bursting out of the TV and into your living room. Langella gives a shining example to all actors portraying comicbook and cartoon characters in live action. There is a pervading sense of dread whenever he appears, especially during Castle Grayskull sequences, and the script gives him some awesome lines which he delivers with pure evil dripping from his voice.The monsters are pretty bloody scary, especially for a family film, especially the Beastman (who's had a 'the' added to his name). The sequence where they invade a school gym and chase Julie around it is excellent, far more exciting and scary than similar chases in many horror films (including some of those Courtney Cox has been in). It's also, like the rest of the film, surprisingly violent, as the bad guys attack Julie with swords, claws, laser guns and high velocity darts. That she manages to escape is not unbelievable at all, because of the way the chase is staged - it's just a relief she gets out of there, the goal of any such chase scene. The sheer ammount of bad guys that the small band of heroes has to face adds greatly to the drama.Setting half of the movie on Earth has it's advantages and disadvantages. It does give the film a human component, and two ordinary teenagers to be pulled into the adventure with. It also makes the monsters scarier - rather than being in a distant galaxy, they are in the neighbourhood, viciously attacking people and destroying whatever they come across. On the other hand, it would have been cool to see some more of the war torn Eternia and the planet's weird inhabitants and locations, but MotU had a relatively small budget, so that sort of stuff was off limit anyway. A little too much time is spent on the almost soap-opera angle of Julie and Kevin, but it helps flesh out their characters to make them believable.
MotU is also packed with action, and we do mean packed. There is an outbreak of violence every 15 minutes or so, usually even less, and there is variety and imagination among the content, unlike many action films, which consist of repetetive shoot outs and nothing more. It could possibly be said that it's quantity over quality, as some of it, particularly the shoot-outs, are badly filmed, and none of the action ever reaches adrenalin pumping. However, it's good enough, in-yer-face and quite exciting to watch, with He-Man taking out hordes of bad guys with his sword, laser beams everywhere, mass destruction and some good old rough and tumble. And all the action grows organically from the story - none of it seems put in simply because the movie needed an action scene at a certain point.One of MotU's greatet assets is it's atmosphere. The sense of an intergalactic civil war is tangible, as is the sheer menace of the villains, the desperation of the good guys, the growing sense of doom as Skeletor captures the Cosmic Key. There is a cower-behind-the-sofa scariness similar to that of TV's Doctor Who.If Masters of the Universe was re-released at cinemas this summer, people would realize how good it is compared to the blockbuster summer fare we get these days. And all for $17m, which was hardly anything, even in 1987.",Masters of the Universe

Check out Back to the Future. 4. Costuming - it has all been done before. Even the old time serials had face masks like Skeletor. Storm Troopers, anyone??? Yes, there is some original stuff, too, but, goodness, so much imitation. Oh, well, it was lit well and the sound was recorded well but that's some of the best of it.

Courtney Cox is now an international super-star, Robert Duncan McNeill has found success in Star Trek: Voyager, and Christina Pickles has now carved out a good career in Friends and with such movies as The Wedding Singer and Romeo & Juliet.This, then is a true example of what struggling actors will do for money and recognition because this movie pays very little attention to the childrens TV series on which it is based, and the result is a laughably dreadful film with little plot and a dreadful script.The only reason to watch this is to view the future stars as they were before they were stars.",Masters of the Universe

The film at least stays true in those regards, reusing shots and locations. While many reviews I've read mention it being boring I found it was just cheap on every level. To the point where a sci-fi film spent more time in LA alleyway ways and houses than on an alien world or fantastical sets.

I'm pleased to say I still enjoyed it as much as I did back then! While the decision to place part of the story in 1980's suburban America, planet Earth, was no doubt a way to keep the budget low, the end result is still a lot of fun, and the main characters manage to stay pretty close to their original characters. Naturally, though, I'd loved to have seen some more of Eternia instead. Unfortunately, the promised sequel never came to be.Frank Langella is simply brilliant; his bigger-then-life portrayal of Skeletor may be different from what they did in the TV series, but it works great. He commands every scene he is in, and his performance is powerful yet subtle at certain moments. Wonderful! By the way, be sure to watch until the end credits are over...Dolph Lundgren, while perhaps not quite the eloquent thespian Langella is, does make a formidable old-fashioned hero.",Masters of the Universe

Frank Langella has probably the most underrated performances as the evil and sinister Skeletor, one of my votes as baddest bad guy in movie history if they had something like that... this is the Jack Nicholson performance of the Joker before Batman. I don't know why people are giving it such a low rating, there are a ton of movies that are a lot worse out there. You have to realize that this was made in 1987 and SFX weren't as good as they are today, but this had heart and it shows if you watch it. If you go into it watching for deeper meanings and all this other stuff that art fans go for, i can see why you'd bash it afterward.

As a child I was hugely into He-Man and thoroughly enjoyed both the animated version as well as this despite them being poles apart.Dolph Lundgren actually does a good job of portraying the muscular mullet while Frank Llangella hams it up under the make up of Skeletor.

80,greg-e-porter,If I was a 12 year old boy in the 80's I would love this...but I'm not.,3,24 August 2016,"So Dolph Lundgren (aka Ivan Drago) is the most powerful man in the universe, He- Man. Skeletor (Langella) is up to his old tricks again; he's trying to take over Castle Grayskull and the magical power held there to become the master of the universe. In their efforts to thwart his advances He-Man and company learn of his secret weapon; a pair of interdimensional keys. To evade capture at the hands of Skeletor and his second in command Evil-Lyn (Foster) - it's like Evilyn but she's eeeevil - He-Man and company make an interdimensional jump. Guess who comes into possession of the super device? Yup, two unlikely heroes: high school seniors Kevin (McNeill) and Julie (who is played by a super young Courtney Cox).If you are a fan of He-Man, you've probably already seen this, but if you haven't I'd bet it would be a hoot. It's fan-service galore. It's one of those movies that assumes you know the characters and places. It translates to a movie that finds it satisfactory to throw named characters on the screen and call it a day.There are some amusing parts about the movie though. If your quota of the '80's isn't full, this'll fill it. Take the interdimensional key. It's used by pressing a sequence of keys (which emit a different tone)...it's like a synthesizer! Good thing Kevin is the keyboard player in his high school band.If the aforementioned notes didn't suggest, everything about this movie screams Saturday morning cartoon cheesy. Now, the cheesiness, of course, isn't an inherently bad thing; that can be fun every once in a while, especially when it can be found on YouTube. That said, there are almost certainly better things to watch. I'd think I'd recommend this if you want to see good old Dolph action and/or you're familiar with He-Man.

Dolph lundgren was kinda wooden and underused and the idea to take the leads out of eternia and taking them to our world was a DEFINITE no no.

84,LordBlacklist,For those who don't want to grow up,10,3 April 2008,"10/10 for the Nostalgic little kid in me I never want to lose. 6 for the jaded film snob in me I'm trying to kill off.Guess who's winning? This was the first film I ever saw in the theater. I was 3 years old and remember it very well. The smell of popcorn, my friend running up the aisle screaming when Skeletor first turned to the camera, my refusal to leave while he waited in the lobby. I always liked Skeletor more than He-Man and a lot of that came from this movie. I watched the cartoon, but the movie is what did it for me as a 3/4 year old. It really influenced me a lot, especially my action figure play as a goofy little kid who enjoyed doing long Skeletor dialogues alongside the usual action figure...action.All these years later, I really do still have a fondness for this film and since it was such a big part of my childhood...I can't judge it too harshly. As a Screenwriter/Filmmaker myself, I understand the problems this movie faced in fitting an epic universe into a less than epic budget. For what it is, the movie works today, but beyond the nostalgia factor, the three undeniable things that still hold up are the realization of Skeletor's character (look, costume, LINES! ACTING!) the set designs for the greyskull throne room, and the majestic score.I don't turn my nose up at good entertainment(I can watch this film and Apocalypse Now in one sitting and enjoy both for different reasons), and this is good entertainment, certainly with more substance than the 2 dimensional crud kids get today.""Tell me about the loneliness of good, He-Man. Is it equal to the loneliness of Evil?"" Think about that line, and the underlying theme that Skeletor, even though he has ""won"" will never be whole because greed needs conflict to survive (i.e. more greedy pursuits, hence Skeletor's obsession with ""breaking"" He-Man).""Men who crave power look back over the mistakes of their lives, pile them all together, and call it destiny."" What it did not have in budget, the film made up with heart. Some of the technical things aren't up to snuff, but again great writing will seep through even when hampered by the constraints of budget (meaning a last second...""let's set most of it on Earth"" note from the producers) David Odell and Gary Goddard did the best with what they had, as did everyone else. Some went above and beyond, Bill Conti, Frank Langella, and for those reasons and more many of us remember this film fondly and enjoy watching it again.",Masters of the Universe
85,nrabond007,Is this movie bad or just merely a guilty pleasure?,6,22 November 2010,"We all grew up watching the cartoon ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" a campy 80's cartoon not particularly well-animated or voiced. Golan-Globus took it upon itself, in Uwe Boll fashion, to create a live-action film version with none other than Dolph Lundgren to play He-Man himself. I don't necessarily see Ivan Drago as a Master of the Universe, but okay, its fun. Frank Langella actually plays a major villainous part as Skeletor and is really the only bright acting spot in the film unless you also consider James Tolkan as a nosy police detective, basically his roles as Tom cruise's superior in ""Top Gun"" and Principal Strickland in ""Back to the Future"" combined. This film answers the universal question of how a sci-fi film is made badly, and the answer is by putting the main characters in peril on Earth. If the filmmakers had the budget this film could have been really amazing, instead we are giving an extremely cheesy storyline and an equally worthless supporting cast. See AVP and AVP:R for reference on how the human element can actually destroy a film. Yet there is a lot to love about this film. It is so bad it is actually entertaining for taking itself so seriously and the story, when not on Earth is average.

And everyone knows that his jaw just goes up-and-down as he speaks.Again, they decided it would be cheaper to cover a human with make-up then design a working skull for Skeletor.

It follows the mythos of the original He-Man mini comics (the ones that came with the toys) more than the plot of the animated series, as such He-Man is not secretly Prince Adam. (My fellow post teenage virgins as well as losers in general will probably understand what I'm talking about.) Anyway Langela proves the perfect Skeletor.  Unlike the cartoon character he proves to be convincingly pure evil.  I must say that he honestly did succeed in being one of the most terrifying villains in movie history. Hat's off to director Gary Goddard and the cast for taking the story entirely seriously and not just dismissing it as a campy hour and a half long toy add.  It's that kind of conviction that distinguishes between art and commercial shlock. This movie also taught me some valuable life lessons.  For instance, if a guy with a skull head gets massive god-like power the only real change he will make to his life is giving himself golden armour.  (Both Skeletor and the Red Skull have done this.)  I also learned that when some one gets god-like power, to defeat them all you need to do is push them into a muddy ditch. Having the characters travel to late 1980's earth made this movie all the better specially since they got to meet Courteney Cox (what a babe. Grrrowwlll).  Why doesn't anybody ever ask her about this movie when she's on talk shows? Oh wait it's cause there's no reason they should care.

(probalby to save a buck)Never the less the plot is acceptable, thanks to David Odelle, the screenwriter. A great part of the movie's power is due to the wonderful screenplay by Odelle. He creates characters with ease, using effective lines to paint their personality and like all those who love the film, I join the chorus is praising that Skeletor is one of the great screen villains of all time, thanks to David Odelle, of course Almost everything Skeletor says portrays regal villainy. (""...Let them rot, let them rot), pomposity (""The people must know I am Greyskull...""), rage (""You are all aware of the penalty for failure!"") Vanity (""I demand the destitution and loneliness of scorn, it is my right, my destiny!""), delusion (just see his god-speech and you'll know what I mean, best villain speech ever) and even Loneliness (""Tell me about the loneliness of good He-man, is it equal to the loneliness of evil?"") Of course the lines written by Odelle are transformed into a tour-de-force portrayal by Frank Langella, everything is fantastic about this role, form his dark brooding voice to wonderful overly dramatic gesticulation. (My friends and I have endless fun, quoting and impersonating Skeletor.) He-man on the other hand is dramatically underwritten, even the stand of between Skeletor and the muscle-bound hero, the blond Scandinavian has little to say. But you'll have fun to see Dolph Lundgren speaking his lines with a thick accent and believe me it just as much fun as Arny.(to bad He-man has no cheesy one-liners The movie is also greatly helped by a fantastic score by Bill Conti. There's an amazing main-theme that in all it's triumph and victorious blazing seems to put the Superman theme to shame to which it bears similarity there's great action music with beautiful trumpet ""solo's"" and there's the majestic pompous theme for Skeletor (that develops as the movie progresses and reaches it climax during Skeletor's bombastic travel to our world)If you want a sci-fi/sword-n-sorcery flick (those two are never combined enough) and a trip to the eighties in all it's glory (watch Krag's hair and you'll know what I mean), and are a sucker for a lager than life villains that takes center stage in a film, I think you will enjoy this movie. So gather your friends, pop a dutch-beer and chew down on pizza as you are whisked away into the world of the film version of Masters of the Universe. I have the power!",Masters of the Universe

94,Jonno-B,Fantastic,10,7 September 2003,"This has to be one of my favourite films of all time. I admit that the acting is a bit ropey in places, and the plot is slightly absurd, but I think that the reasons it means so much to me are a bit more personal.As a young boy of 6 years old when the film was released, this was the first action type film that I saw, and as ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" was my favourite cartoon series at the time, it held a special appeal for me. I still can't describe the feeling of seeing my favourite characters come to life on screen!! :-)Thank goodness this film is now on DVD in the UK. It has been off general release for far to long, and now fans of the original series, and the new series (which is very faithful to the original) can see this treasure!!",Masters of the Universe
95,indianman,best movie for boys in 1987,10,25 April 2001,"I first saw this movie in 1987 at the age of 11 and was already a big He-Man fan. I was disappointed not with the casting which was great. The actor who played He-man was great as well as the guy who was Skeletor. The only thing missing was that He-Man had an alter ego like all the great superhero know as Prince Adams. It was also missing his cat Battle Cat. The King and Queen were missing, but not totally needed. I think a computer generated Orko with the voice of the actor who did him in the cartoon series would have made this an even better movie",Masters of the Universe

Considering it's literally based off toys (not the cartoon which is why there's no Prince Adam) it should be terrible but imo it works well! The action is pretty great and very 80s, Dolph Lundgren is good, Man-At-Arms is literal perfection, Teela is decent, and surprising the 2 main human characters aren't to annoying. All in all a film that is just so so fun!",Masters of the Universe
97,tnman26,why?,7,3 November 2001,Why doesn't this movie get more recoignition? Call me dumb or whatever but this is a cool movie.i have to admit i was a huge master of the universe fan before the movie came out..the cartoon and the action figures i had. To me this movie seems to be a cross between Conan and Star Wars. It has the sword fighting and the laser blasts..Plus the subplot of these fantastical characters coming to out planet and enteracting with teenagers..I really wish this movie had done good at the box office so a sequel would have came forth...even Skelator says at the end of the credits..ill be back..but he never did...,Masters of the Universe
98,j-jameson,Eternia is real,8,17 March 2009,"Every time I see this movie it reminds me that Masters of the universe was the best action figure series there has ever been or will be. (Can you even compare them to.. what? Turtles?.. OK they were cool.. but NO.) There could have definitely been a more charismatic actor as He-Man than Dolph, but he does it OK and definitely has the muscles required. Skeletors character works very well in this movie and I think it really did justice to the original. Some people even compare Skeleter to Dark Vader, the villain of all time, so there has to be something good.. eh.. evil in this character and after all what would have been Skeletor like if they would have done two more of these? If we would only have the first SW-film the Vader wouldn't look that much better from Skeletor would it? This is really a great fantasy classic all tho -like said- it could have obviously been much better.I hear people saying a lot that it ruins the movie because it's set on earth - I have to disagree because this way I felt that He-Man was so much more real. Isn't that one of the reasons why so many of us liked this movie as a child (and still do;)? - Because we want to dream Eternia being a truly existing place.",Masters of the Universe
99,Cinema_Lover,"Unbelievably Stupid, but fun camp nontheless...",1,9 May 2004,"Masters of the Universe is one of those low grade E.T. wannabe 80's kids films like Exlporers that has developed a weirded out cult following over the years.  He-Man has always been something of an enigma, I loved this character when I was a kid, but looking at how cheap and retarded the 80's Filmation cartoon was I can't for the life of me figure out what was going through my head to actually come back for more.I do remember this movie from 1987, and thank God I'm not the only one that remembers a key fact that this movie's release year of 1987 was WELL AFTER the initial He-Man craze of 1982-'85.  That clearly hurt the movie.  If you were some 5 year old back then, you probably didn't care and loved the movie despite it's stupidty just because you were 5.  Those of us that were a bit older remember that by 1987, shows like Knight Rider and A-Team were already canceled and off the air.  And even the Transformers/G.I. Joe weren't very popular, to say nothing of the goofy He-Man cartoon.  I was still very much a child in 1987 at around the age of 11 and 12, so I remember having the kid interest in this film.  But it was also crushed with the newly developed pressure to ""act cool"" since I was heading into 7th grade and thus had to leave behind all my elementary school ways.  A cheap ass made for 5 year olds movie like this was dreadful for the image of any pre-teen back then, despite the fact that practically everyone secretly yearned to watch it.The film is packed to the hilt with all kinds of unintentional hilarity, and the campy, gaudy 80's flavor will leave you howling.  Dolph Lundergon looks like he is in a European smut film with that fetishistic gay porno costume of his.  Man at Arms and Teela have respectively cheap looking Halloween rental costumes, but Frank Langella really elevates this movie from bargain basement crap to cult status.  Langella really steals the show as Skeletor, and the makeup is suprisingly effective.  Yes this movie is stupid beyond belief, but it's about He-Man and it's from the 80's.  So give it a chance, I'm 28 years old now and I'll still watch this movie for fun.5/10",Masters of the Universe

102,IrishWriter34,"Oh, what might have been....",4,4 June 2002,"This was the premise of a classic toy line and the classic cartoon that emerged from it: When the planet Eternia-think a futuristic Camelot-comes under attack by the demon sorcerer Skeletor in an attempt to abscond with the mythical Castle Grayskull and thus conquer the universe, Prince Adam, teenage son of Eternia's King Randor and Queen Marlena, discovers that he has been chosen by destiny to bear Grayskull's power against all who would threaten Eternia's safety. By raising the enchanted Sword of Grayskull aloft and shouting ""By the Power of Grayskull,"" Adam is transformed into the superheroic swashbuckler He-Man, and proceeds to do battle with Skeletor...and to try and prove himself to his demanding father.From that premise, Filmation created a terrific cartoon that, even though it had its share of '80s cheese, was rich and complex, deftly mixing Arthurian legend with sci-fi. At its essence, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE was a coming-of-age story set against a high-tech sword and sorcery backdrop. As such, it had the makings of a great movie. Unfortunately, the low-budget Golan-Globus team (which destroyed SUPERMAN IV) got their hands on it, and we the viewers got cheated. The essence of MOTU was trashed; the Adam/He-Man duality and everything it entailed was tossed away. Several critical characters, like Randor, Marlena, Cringer/Battle Cat (Adam's pet tiger), and the like were ignored. And finally, 90% of the character and set designs immortalized by the toys and cartoon were changed as to be unrecognizable. Only Man-At-Arms, Skeletor, and Skeletor's lover/servant Evil-Lyn emerged on film as being visually recognizable as their cartoon counterparts.So what did we get in return? We got a shameless, low-budget STAR WARS rip-off. Instead of the myriad beasts, demons, and cyborgs that Skeletor employed in the cartoon/toy line, we got three beasts and a bunch of armored stormtroopers. Instead of getting a He-Man who captured the feel of the character, we got a wooden Conan wannabe who relied more on laser guns than on his sword. Instead of a story that spanned Eternia and carried the appropriate sci-fi/fantasy feel of the series, we got a story that took place primarily on Earth, complete with a crabby cop and two ditzy teens. Instead of having a skilled, experienced director at the helm, we got unsteady, pedestrian direction from novice filmmaker Gary Goddard (whose day job was designing amusement parks). Sure, we got some excellent FX work, a great Bill Conti score, and a terrific Castle Grayskull throne room set, but we also got bad costumes, a stupid Grayskull exterior that looks like a pirate ship, a plotless script that's all noise and no depth, substandard fight choreography, and really bad acting. Only Man-At-Arms (Jon Cypher), Skeletor (Frank Langella), and Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster) are well-acted in this film; Langella's theatrical performance in particular is the film's saving grace, and deserved to be in a much better movie. Otherwise everyone else in the cast stinks. Dolph Lundgren is a perfect physical match for He-Man, but the guy can't act and his awkward Swedish accent has been the butt of fan jokes for years. Everyone else is just too vapid, too bland, and just too unsuited for the roles to be any good. This film needed to be a big-budget affair with top-rate actors and a script that followed the cartoon closely, not a STAR WARS wannabe that fails on most levels. THE BEASTMASTER with Marc Singer was far closer to the spirit of MOTU than this film (and Singer's Dar looked and acted far more like He-Man than Lundgren's hero did), and is a vastly superior movie. Pretty sad that the actual MOTU movie didn't even come close to matching that level, isn't it?To be fair, I initially saw this film when I was 9 and enjoyed it, but over time I realized how weak it really was, and how it could have been so much more. While I don't HATE the film, I don't like it too much, either, and it hasn't aged well. This summer, Mattel will relaunch MOTU with a brand-new cartoon series and toy line that retells the story of Prince Adam/He-Man from the beginning. Hopefully, if Hollywood decides to make another go at a He-Man movie, they'll use the cartoon as the baseline and get it right this time. As it stands, the 1987 film is an OK way to kill a few hours, but as a He-Man film and as a fantasy film, it just doesn't cut it.",Masters of the Universe
103,willstrong79,Skeletor Makes the Movie,9,14 July 2005,"Let's face it they don't make the like this anymore. The script could have been better . But Frank Lagella almost immortalizes Skeletor. If their a new film a actor needs to use this portrayal of Skeletor as inspire. The special effects are great for that time period and if the budget had been higher it probably would have become a classic like Star Wars and Flash Gordon.Dolph was alright as well. But I'm afraid he and the other actors are out done by the villains. This may do to the fact we really can't get any good characterization out our heroes. THe film deserves attention do to the fact that in the 80's this film included with such films as Back to the Future, Willow, Indiana Jones,and Star Wars really pushed the boundaries of what could be done on film , at least in the realm of science fiction and fantasy. We need to understand and continue try to achieve more great scifi and fantasy films like this one.",Masters of the Universe

105,man14,A classic from the 80's,6,11 March 2018,"I saw this film for the first time 30 years ago, when it premired in my country (Portugal) in July 1988. I was 15 then, and for a teenager in the 80's this film was a treat. It had everything: a great hero, a great villain, a lot of fantasy, great fight scenes, hot chicks (Chelsea Field looked realy hot in that tight outfit of hers), awsome special effects. It's no wonder I loved it, no wonder it became one of my favourite fantasy films.
Of course, when we're young we tend to overlook the flaws of our favourite films, either because we're so invested in the story and with the fate of the characters, or simply because we're young and not that experienced as moviegoers. The fact is that this film has flaws. 
The screenplay is very unbalanced, there is no character introduction, the writers simply assume the audience knows these characters and their world, and that's a mistake. I and most kids my age knew the comics this film is based on, but a lot of people in the audience didn't and some kind of introduction would have been nice. The pace is also very uneven, first you have about 10-15 minutes of very fast fight scenes in Eternia and then the action is transfered to Earth and the pace becomes rather slow, taking the time to introduce all the earth characters and their motivation. It's only when Skeletor decides to come to Earth himself with his army that the pace picks up again. 
The acting isn't remarkable, but it isn't bad either. The best of them all, unsurprisingly, is the great Frank Langela as Skeletor - he manages to make a rather bi-dimensional and un-interesting character into a tri-dimensional person, a real evil-doer that you would hate to meet in person. Lundgren looks the part, but is acting is a little wooden. Still, he looks great swinging a sword and is awsome at kicking @ss, so we forgive him for not being that great an actor. The rest of the cast are adequate in their parts, which they play competently. There are a lot of cheesy lines in this movie, as was typical in this kind of flick in the 80's, but that only contributes to it's charm, even 30 years later. The special effects, though acceptable for 1987, are clearly dated, the film hasn't aged well in that department. Skeletor's makeup, though, is pretty good, even by today's standards. 
The direction is adequate, Gary Goddard did the best he could with what he was given to work with. Given a larger budget and a better screenplay he probably would have made a much better movie. 
Still, it's a very entertaining movie and it brings back good memories from my youth. If you ignore the somewhat dated special effects and the overall cheesyness of the film, you're in for a lot of fun. I give it 6 stars out of 10.",Masters of the Universe

109,kgwrote-854-104240,Better written than its carbon copy Transformers 2007,8,8 June 2021,"When this came out I did not think much of it. The story almost completely ditches the cartoon and the toy story line. Looking back on it now, and comparing it to similar movies of today, one appreciates the effort much more.Given the limitations they had (no easy to use CGI back then), deciding to graft a Back to the Future-inspired framing story onto it showed some creative ingenuity. They even bring James Tolkan from that series to appear in a larger role. They also took the Eternia side of the story seriously. Skeletor and Evil Lyn are playing it straight without any self-aware humor. Thank goodness, because in our post- MST3K culture, the expectation is for Disney-style jokes to dispel any possible suspension of disbelief. Flash Gordon 1980 might be entertaining, but it is ultimately a joke. The fantasy has no serious weight. You are meant to laugh at it.So credit Cannon and co. That they did treat He-Man seriously. Lundgren's voice is not ideal, but he is doing the role straight as can be and considering how Hollywood shuns or mocks such characters (fat Thor)--it's rather amazing that he got respectable treatment.And then there is Langella. At the time it came out I did not pay attention to his performance, he simply was not the cartoon Skeletor. But it has aged well, since he played the role without a joking attitude. As others have said, he acts as if he is Richard the Third. What Disney/Marvel bad guy in their comic book movies conveys that kind of performance?Which brings me to Transformers 2007. The plot of that movie is two alien forces coming to Earth to quarrel over an object of great importance in the possession of teenagers who are caught in between them and pursued by legal authorities. John Turturro is doing the James Tolkan part but with much weaker dialogue.If Cannon could manage a decent B-movie script on limited money then what excuse does Paramount and Spielberg have for such their dim-witted toy movie?I give it a 7 for the effort and 1 extra point for Langella, probably the best performance by someone playing a toy.",Masters of the Universe
110,Exeter79,The problem with Power,4,29 July 2019,"It's incredible how many people love this movie today. When it was released, back in 1987, everybody hated it. I remember the big disappointment with the cheap costumes, cheap special effects, the silly plot, and the cast of characters that had little to no resemblace with the cartoon and the toys.I must say that Dolph Lundgren perfectly suits as He-Man, and his outfit looks pretty good. The reset is, well, embarassing: Man-At-Arms and Teela are unrecognizable, the Sorceress is an old lady with cheap plastic spikes on her head, Evil-Lyn is fascinating but could be a general evil mistress out of any fantasy movie. And then we have Skeletor. The greatest villain of the 1980s' is turned into a lame copycat of Emperor Palpatine, in his laughable make up, looking nothing like a skull. Frank Langella might be the most convincing actor in this bunch, but he's not Skeletor, sorry.You know who are the best characters around? Blade and Saurod! The latter having the outstanding look of the real kick-ass villain. A pity that he gets killed immediately... they had to cut costs, maybe? Oh, and Gwildor is not at all more irritating than Orko. In the end, Lou Scheimer packed both the He-Man and She-Ra cartoon series with dwarves and gnomes, so why not Gwildor?There isn't even need to talk about the boring plot, the fact that, pretty early in the movie, He-Man and co. arrive on Earth, making sure that no Eternian settings are needed, the infamous Star Wars (but more likely, Black Hole) troops rip off, the final transformation of Skeletor into... a cross between Lo-Pan from ""Big Trouble in Little China"" and a Saint Seya!?Still, ""Masters of the Universe"" is surely fun to watch as an 80's camp/trash classic.

111,chris-683,Very Good,8,1 April 2000,"I actually saw this movie when it was in theaters, way back when I was just a kid in '87. I remember liking it then, and I still do now. Yes, I know, it is a bit of a rip off of Star Wars, but keep these two things in mind: 1) This takes place primarily on Earth 2) It was based on the cartoon TV show.The movie is without question on of the best TV show-movie conversions ever. Considering the disasters of late (Batman & Robin, The Avengers) this movie turned out real well. The reason is the cast, it was great. Dolph Lundgren earned my admiration after this movie, and so did Frank Langella(recently seen in Roman Polanski's ninth gate). These to guys acted so good. Skeletor comes across as a cunning, evil bad guy who will stop at nothing to achieve what he wants. I love that line ""I am not in a giving vein"", after Blade says ""Give me one more chance"". Courtney Cox does a very good job in this movie, and so does Chesela Field (Remember her from The Last Boy Scout, ""I don't hate you Joe, you're the one that hates you""). There are a lot of good one-liners in this movie too, but I don't want to ruin it for you.One thing good about this movie is it is NOT just for fans of the show, because it is presented in a form that allows those unfamiliar with it to enjoy it (and trust me, you will).",Masters of the Universe

If for no other reason, watch this fantastic actor deliver a hell-raising performance.",Masters of the Universe
114,Shooshoo80,Disrespect to the Cartoon Series,2,5 June 2001,"May Contain Spoilers: This is one of the worse adaptations of a cartoon series by a movie I have ever seen. Hollywood has been known for dropping the ball, when it comes to making movies based on cartoons, comic books, and video games. They seem to always screw up. And this is proof right here. I was a fan of He-Man and She-Ra back in the eighties, and when I heard that there was a movie out that was based on He-Man I was thrilled. When I finally saw the movie, I was highly upset. First of all, Why did they set most of the movie on earth? What about GRAYSKULL dammit! Second, why was Skeletor only in the movie for the first 5 minutes and the last 15 minutes? Third, what did those lame teenage characters have to do with the story?Another complaint is that there wasn't really any sword fighting in the movie. The only sword fighting that took place was between Skeletor and He-man, and that was poorly choreographed. The best part of the movie is the first five minutes. The rest goes down hill. This movie isn't good enough to watch even when there's nothing on T.V. In addition, the characters could of been developed a little bit more. The special effects could of been better too. My other big complaint is Dolph Lungren. He looks the part, but he can't act worth a sh**. He spends most of his time smiling and looking cute in the camera. Hard-rock pecks can only get you so far. When Lungren tries to show some depth, it's just pathetic. Sure, he looks the part but he needs to stick to roles where he hardly speaks and/or just pouts in the camera (Rocky IV and Universal Soldier). Marc Singer, of Beastmaster fame, would have been better for the part. Since, he can act and had a wash board stomach at the time. Yes...his hair is brown but it could of been dyed. Frank Langella was okay as Skeletor for the short time he was in the movie. But he kind of hammed it up. All of the hamm in the world can't save a DOO-DOO script, and this movie has a doo-doo script. Courtney Cox is probably shaking her head in shame at this one. Thank God...they didn't make a movie to the SHE-RA series. Godzilla (1998)was better than this trash. The movie isn't even bad/entertaining (Kull the Conqueror).I give this movie a 2/10, and that's for the first 5 minutes and the brief scenes with Skeletor.",Masters of the Universe
115,CapsNut,Worse Ways to Kill Time,3,30 July 2020,"So looking to kill time during the pandemic I've been going through my On Demand section and picking out movies that for one reason or another I haven't gotten around to seeing. I dialed up this one last week and (in addition to being glad it was free) I wouldn't have finished it if I had anything better to do, which at the moment, I really don't.I remember watching the cartoon as a kid and thinking that they should have just gone with making a feature film from the cartoon rather than trying to do live action. I have no idea why this is considered a ""cult classic."" Frank Langella's performance as Skelletor is why this movie gets even 3 stars. Without it, I would have given it only one. Dolph Lundgren clearly ended his career as a leading actor with this performance and the rest of the cast couldn't quite figure out if they were doing something totally campy and cheesy like the 1960's Batman television show or trying to do something remotely serious and as a result, come up with neither.The only characters given anything resembling a backstory are the ones who were specifically created for this mess. I barely remember the cartoon so the lack of backstory for the main characters had be wondering me lost. Furthermore this movie really puts the ""special"" in ""special effects"" and the sad part is, it really isn't worth laughing at because it is just so pathetic.",Masters of the Universe
116,MacShoreman,Not perfect but has a sustaining quality,6,17 November 2011,"This movie is not among the best but it has far more entertaining value than other in same genre and from same era. When reading reviews, the earliest ones are the ones rating this movie lowest and the later ones gives the higher scores. One explanation can be that He-Man is not as popular these days and knowledge about He-Man's origin as a comics hero is not as common as back when the movie premiered. The movie got a lot of negative reviews because it was not true to the stories the film is based upon. There is three main reason why this movie not get higher rating from me than 6/10. One and obvious reason is the story it self as stated above. It lacks resemblance to the original He-man theme. Another reason is some weak performances from leading actors like Mr Lundgren, Cox and Field. The third reason is the movie it self after the music store scene. I seen the movie couple of times and after the scene where Cox meet Foster in the alley behind the music store, in which a battle is taking place, the whole movie drops from a decent B-movie to C-movie level. Special effects and story becomes more strained. Battle in the heart of the town and no humans seems to react is annoying and the hover pods special effects is far from entertaining. It would have been better for the film if the scene took place on a more deserted place or even not on Earth and if they replaced the pod chase with a less effect depending battle event. However, this is not an all bad movie. It is entertaining and have qualities on many levels. Some performances are better than one is used to see in films from end 80's in this genre and also the costumes and decor are well made. Compared to many sci-fi/fantasy TV productions of today like Farscape for example this movie is still going strong. Compared to Disney Channel movies in the genre this is a master piece. Mr Lundgrens costume could have been bit more modified for movie visuals though. Notable performances without handing out Oscar nominations are Langella, Foster, Barty, McNeill and Cypher. These actors made this movie enjoyable. Lundgren, Field and Tolkan did not reach all the way and to me, Cox was some thing of a disappointment. The movie have a entertainment value still and for a movie released 1987, in a special effect dependent genre where techniques grow old in months, it's actually a bit impressing.",Masters of the Universe

118,richardredner,Almost only works with horseshoes and hand grenades,8,26 May 2020,"This movie could have been a huge successful box office smasher! I'll keep this simple and list out the mistakes;
1. Should have taken place fully in Eternia. Using Earth as the location was obviously their solution to budget restraints. But it also ruined the original storyline of Prince Adam's Mother being from Earth since in the movie they make it completely obvious that this land is foreign and never been heard of.2. Should have stuck with the characters most commonly used in the cartoon.
Should have subbed Gwildor for Orco.
Should have subbed the 3 random assassins with more known evil henchmen, like merman and Lokjaw.
Should have shown the king and queen.3. Since there was no issue with wearing cheesy wardrobe, then they should have made an effort to mimic the garb that the characters wear in the cartoon. Especially He-Man, Man-At-Arms, and Teela. As well as He-Mans sword!4. No mention of Prince Adam nor any appearance by him.
Along with no Adam there was no Kringer or Battlecat.5. This is the biggest one! Why on earth was there never a transformation scene of Adam turning into He-Man.
I gave this film 8 stars because there WAS a film at all. They took a chance and the studios went with it. That deserves respect. But its obvious that there wasn't enough faith in its performance, by the small budget and low amount of advertising . Thats a huge mistake these studios make is their low advertising budgets. Films like this and Jupiter Ascending would be hits if there's more prerelease advertising.",Masters of the Universe
119,ihateleo,I've Always Liked This.,10,24 September 2004,"I am positively sure that most would consider this lackluster and cheesy, but I have to go by my own personal viewing of the film.Maybe I am a little partial to it because this was one of my favorite's as a child.Firstly, the performances of Frank Langella, Meg Foster and Courtney Cox are all filled with class and a certain finesse that not only makes the film exciting but also enjoyable to watch.Sure the film would have been a great deal better if it had all been on Eternia, that fact has always been indisputable.This film needed much more than 17 million to be the epic that it rightfully deserved to be.I must also compliment the near perfect, flamboyant score by Bill Conti.On a down note I do feel as if the story would have benefited more with a larger number of the cartoon series' characters..but those were all script decisions.There is one scene in particular towards the end where Skeletor is being transformed into a god-like being that particularly stands out.Langella's acting there puts to shame most of all of your supposedly great performances of modern day.On a final note I also think it's truly a shame that the new He-Man cartoon was cancelled, and that there can not be a movie produced in Hollywood's dry, remake fringed state of today.Who knows, it may actually make money.Masters of The Universe ""Has The Power"" to entertain.",Masters of the Universe

This is a great sci-fi action flick fantasy, which is very entertaining and is meant for all viewers of all ages. Surprisingly they do a good job, in showing some parts of Eternia but not all of it is shown in the movie, many things is missing in the movie from the cartoon series. They also did a great job with the costumes, special effects and make-up, especially Beast Man, Karg and Saurod.As He-Man, Dolph Lundgren does look good in this role. With his hot look going for him, he does a terrific job as He-man, the man is definitely in good shape and must have been told to tan to look as much as possible like He-man.I miss the good old days when they used to use laser firing guns, sword to sword combat and cool creative monsters.",Masters of the Universe
124,wonderboss,Best STAR WARS imitation of them all!,7,14 January 2005,"This movie wasn't given a chance back in the 80s simply because it was based on a toy. Nowadays, with big-budget epics based on video games and other playthings being a common occurrence, you'd think people would be a bit more open-minded. It's true that MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE really is a low-budget movie but it does a great job stretching its meager funds into a very elaborate fantasy look. The production design by William Stout is fabulous and Gary Goddard's direction is quite stylish. Bill Conti's music score is especially noteworthy -- one of the best fantasy-adventure scores of the era. Skeletor's prosthetic make-up takes a bit of getting used to (not so great, I'm afraid) but Frank Langella plays him like he was doing Richard III at the Old Vic! I love it -- there's not an ounce of the tiresome eye-rolling which most ""legitmate"" actors feel compelled to introduce into these types of roles (think Peter O'Toole in SUPERGIRL). Many of the reviews already posted seem to fault the film for not being more faithful to the TV cartoon. I was already a grown-up when this one came out and had never seen the cartoon, so I took it at face value as a stand-alone film. The decision to set most of the picture on earth (which I'm told was done for budgetary reasons) actually gives MASTERS a nice ""TARZAN'S NEW YORK ADVENTURE"" quality that I find quite appealing. All in all, I think this is the best of the many low-budget STAR WARS imitations that came out in the 80s and a very entertaining drive-in style ""night at the movies.""

126,thajose,Frank Langella,9,23 September 2021,"I am dead serious, Frank Langella should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of Skeletor.This movie is far better than the IMDB score lets on. I feel like people chastise it because they expected it to be based on the goofy cartoon, rather than the toy line, or the mini-comics that originally came with the toys. Regardless, the movie turned out to be one of the best mediums that Masters of the Universe has ever graced. Sure, there is a bit of ""plotholeium"" with regard to a few elements, but all things considered the movie took some odd concepts and made them work really well. I loved it when I was a kid when saw it in theaters, and I loved it even more when I watched it 30 years later with my own son (who, knowing nothing about MotU, also thought that Skeletor was one of the baddest dudes alive). Seriously. Oscar for Frank. Right now.Edit: Shortly after writing my original review, I re-watched this movie. I enjoyed as much as ever. This thing was perfectly cast. I'm not sure you could get a human being to look closer to a real-life He-Man than Dolph Lundgren did. John Cypher as the grizzled, war veteran Man-at-Arms was fantastic. The entire cast, top to bottom was great. I am not sure it would be possible to make this work in live action any better than this movie did, particularly given the restraints the filmmakers were working with.",Masters of the Universe
127,rar2,It is much better that regarded,7,27 July 2005,"I have read a number of reviews on this movie and they are accurate and good for the most part. My credit is to Gary Goddard for all he endured and still getting a credible and succinct movie made.The fight scenes are real and actual so they seem methodical but they're great. The hair, clothing, make-up, special effects, and down the list we go, is so caked in '80s gunk it would be hard to fight for this as a classic. It is the only He-Man movie out there, and although a sequel beckons, eighteen years have passed without a stir.If a sequel were to made Langella would have to be Skeletor. I mean the best acting from both he and Lundgren comes when He-Man is being led by the Centaurian. Langella saying ""I give you a choice: return to Eternia with me as my slave and save their despicable lives, or perish with them here on this tasteless, and primitive, planet."" It's cold and dark and it's authentic. It's chilling and you get chills. Langella overacts sometimes but mostly is great. He took Skeletor from a whiny, irritating, and downright pathetic worm of a guy to a believable, earthy, credible, and despicable evil-doer. We get a taste of the importance of He-man and all that he does, here in this scene, too.Goddard did something brilliant here, he made the movie personable. He puts these people on Earth, interacting with Earthlings, and putting a grasp on how out there these ""aliens"" are. But it is also probably why this movie is so widely disregarded, because it doesn't have great and illustrative fight scenes. Instead they are sensible and plotted. To see this movie remade could be a real treat.Gwildar is, essentially, Orco. He was easy, sensible, irritating, but not nearly as annoying, and unfairly Billy Barty was nominated for a Razzie. The story interlocks with this missing ""key"" as created by Gwildar. This cosmos idea of God-like power through the manifestation of a fourth dimension is highly advanced. This is why the movie is good. Portals are doors and He-Man is definitely a science fiction adventurer. This puts an Earthy spin on an idea wiling out.Teela works and Man-in-Arms (Duncan) is good as a faithful sidekick to He-Man. That's what he is. He can hold his own but mostly is fighting for duty of right, and he follows He-Man for he is the epitome of it. Teela's gritty and pitched voice, with her desperate actions, are very formidable. Duncan is best when inspiring Kevin. Kevin is a sensitive guy with a talent. What these Eternians do is showcase pessimism on Earth for their planet is dying at their own hands. They are their own good and evil and it is hard to differentiate, so why care? By the end of the movie Courtney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeill (Julie and Kevin) see that. So does Lubic. The Eternians have no planet and yet they continue to hold hope and forge ahead: He-Man. Tolkan is not so much a distraction as he is pretentious. McNeill yelling to Tolkan ""Lubic this is for real"" as he dodges a Centaurian blast doesn't hold much weight, or reality. It is about unity, division, and strength. Both literal and figurative.Meg Foster is great as Evil-Lyn because she improves the movie rather than take time from Skeletor. Goddard lets most of the acting chops fall to the incomparable Frank Langella. He-Man is the ambassador of good. He is to talk slow, be level-headed, and search for justice. Lundgren does all of these things. He mission isn't to be malicious and blood seeking. When he runs into Julie (and a great fight sequence ensues) it is Duncan and Teela doing some leg work. He-Man is a protector. He'll abate killing Skeletor to keep any and all safe. In all honesty how many lines can you give someone? Someone suggested Brad Pitt as He-Man for a remake. I don't mind Pitt, but he would ham up the screen like some feel Skeletor did. Skeletor's was good, He-Man's would not be. Lundgren, in all honesty, is great. He has a mullet but looks the part, and contrary to popular belief, acts it. He wields the Sword of Grayskull gracefully, yet with force and some clumsiness. It's heavy, but he's well-skilled and versed in the sword. These oppositions are found in the Soceress. She would normally seem bad to us; however, she is the greatest power of good. Christina Pickles gives great lines of philosophy allowing for good banter and humor with Skeletor. And her love for He-Man is very evident and clear with solid acting.The cartoon is hardly to be found here, aside from the characters and Eternia. Battle cat, and all other characters good and bad, could cloud a remake. But it would be great to see history revealed for He-Man like the new Batman series has done. People forget we like to see depth in our characters. And the character Charlie is filler, not unimportant, but certainly not integral. He's written well. All in all watch this movie because it's really, quite engrossing.",Masters of the Universe

140,banditt76,Possibly a period piece,10,9 November 2001,"This is the kind of movie that can almost only be enjoyed in the context of when it came out.  I suppose just seeing it on TBS like, I guess, the viewers who voted did, then you might not think highly of it. but it takes the normal he-man comic\cartoon and changes it up a little for the screen. example all of the comic\cartoon he-mans episodes took place in he-mans homeland where grayskull was and with skeletor always lacking in his attempt to take over the castle.  In attempts to make it less of a fantasy and more relateable they set it mainly on earth and though it may have hurt comic fans to see he-man only and not as the prince. Also no Panthor, i believe that was his panters name but maybe im wrong. I have to admit i loved the cartoon but i was only 5 in 87 when the movie came out so i saw very little of the cartoon. which came out in 82.  But it has an intresting new plot entangling the 2 worlds and also. Great action scenes. Plus lets not forget the late Billy Barter, Who has a really funny voice (see willow for more Billy Barter).  The music is very well done and plus there is that ode to comic\cartoon fans where he-man shots at the end. ""I HAVE THE POWER""
You have to love that. I love this movie, its hard to find and very unappreciated.  I love when it comes on TBS but now i own it so i can watch it every now and then.  It was unavailable for years but i think it will be realeased on DVD soon so they re-realeased it on VHS. I should have waited for the DVD and bought it but oh well.You dont have to love it but please dont vote that it is a bad movie cause its not.  You shouldn't watch it objectively watch it thinking its a good movie. Thats my advice. If i picked apart every little think i didnt like about the movie and rated it on that, then i would not be criticing it correctly. You have to see a movie as a whole not in its horrible little bits. It's the final battle between to huge comic book characters. Then latter scenes where Skeletor gets both swords and has all that power is just magnificint.  You cant watch it thinking, man the 80's were lame. Its a great little movie. Just cause its not ""Gone in 60 seconds"" (which i dont think is very good) I promise you in the next 2 decades 60 seconds will be just of badly thought of then as masters of the universe is thought of now. You get what i am saying. Some movies can only be enjoyed at the age you first saw them. I saw this movie when i was 5 i loved it then. so i think fondly of it so i like it now.

The acting is really something else, half the time I'm wondering why He-Man sounds so damn happy. Considering that Castle Greyskull has fallen to a surprise attack by Skeletor and the Sorceress is his prisoner, this guy should be a little worried.Soon he discovers how the forces of evil penetrated their defenses, a slightly insane Dwarf who created the ultimate key. This key, which sounds like it was manufactured by Yamaha, can open anything - even doorways between dimensions. Which is how the group ends up on Earth, though the device which brought them there lands some distance away.This gives a neat reason to include a budding Courteney (not a joke about her breasts, well maybe) and her A-Ha idolizing boyfriend, because they find the Cosmic Key and immediately begin playing with it.Skeletor's forces lock in on the signals and battles rage through the suburbs. Surprise, surprise the good guys lose the first encounter and He-Man is taken in chains back to Greyskull, everyone else is left alive on Earth to rot.Of course Gwildor MacGuyvers up a makeshift Cosmic key and Kevin remembers the song to open the gateway to Eternia. He-Man sees his friends, breaks free, and recovers his sword for a final battle with a Skeletor (who has just absorbed the power of the universe, as if that would matter. He's the BAD guy, Dolph is the GOOD guy - he's screwed).Okay, the film is very predictable, but combine the premise with a ""motivating"" fantasy score and I start cracking up. They should play this music in mental wards, though having two hundred people in gowns acting like Conan would probably be bad...",Masters of the Universe
147,tru_sal19,Going from Eternia to Earth to Exciment!!,8,13 August 2012,"""Masters Of The Universe"" is the story of He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) that saves Eternia and Earth from the evil of Skeletor (Frank Langella) and Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster). He saves the universe with the help from Teela (Chelsea Field), Duncan (Jon Cypher), Gwildor (Billy Barty), and two humans, Julie Winston (Courteney Cox) & Kevin Corrigan (Robert Duncan McNeill). In order to save Eternia, they have to save the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull (Christina Pickles) from the hands of evil. In you like action and going from one world to another, you are going to enjoy this film. Plus, the special effects are very good, comparing to the year the film was made, 1987. Lastly, Dolph Lundgren does a great He-Man, and a great hero must have a great villain in Frank Langella.",Masters of the Universe

It is very well done going between Earth and Eternia. Casting is top notch and the script is great. There is a great mixture of effects and live shots. I highly recommend you see this movie. I wished they would have gone on to make a sequel but Lundgren said he wouldn't do it and Cannon films went under shortly after the script for the sequel to this movie was redone and made into another of my favorite movies Cyborg Starring Van Damme.

A movie adaption of a cartoon I loved that stayed true with all their characters. Seeing Skeletor and his monsters was always kinda scary and Evil-Lyn was kinda hot I suppose.They did a excellent job of casting Dolph Lundgren as He-Man and seeing a young Courtney Cox is cool in retrospect.And to this day I still have that beat from THAT cosmic keytar stuck in my head.There are a lot scenes in this film that will stick to your head really. There is some type of awesomeness to these old school sci-fi films that were low on special effects and makeup but that made it seem even more real to a little kid.The movie is what it is, a cartoon adaption, but for a movie made in 1987, they almost got it perfectly right.",Masters of the Universe

I admit it wasn't great but Dolph Lundren and Frank Langella were both good enough for there roles. The only reason why this film failed for me was why the they go to earth. Eternia was so much more interesting than stupid earth and those people that they found were so annoying. I didn't want to see any stupid humans I wanted to see Masters of The Universe characters.

This movie takes the general idea of he-man and mixes it with the empire from star wars. This does not work well and will certainly offend fans of the series. That being said the cast is good. Dolph lundgren is probably one of the better choices for he-man at that time. Frank Langella plays skeletor to perfection (even if the makeup is a little obvious) and billy barty is a nice addition to the overall cast. Thanks to the cast the movie would have gotten a 6/10 if not for the absence of ortho.

It thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously, allowing us to just enjoy it as the light bit of entertainment that it is.Frank Langella is unexpectedly excellent as Skeletor under all that make-up, and it was fun to see Star Trek Voyager's ""Mr. Paris"" at a very young age here.(His first major role perhaps?) Dolph Lundgren is as unexpressive as usual, but at least he looks the part.

I really loved the scenes with Dolph Lundgren's He-Man and Courteney Cox's character, cause I think Dolph and Courteney were awesome together. I think that Dolph Lundgren's He-Man is better than Christopher Reeves' Superman. The opening and ending music of Masters of the Universe sounds a lot like the original Superman theme song.

This film is just a movie fan base, not a movie for people who CGi effects and fast action are habituated.This movie is just for fans like me. Nothing special for people who do not know he-man.

At age 6, this movie was about as enjoyable as going to Disneyland.
Frank Langella's Skeletor was absolutely terrifying for me. But of course, anyone familiar with Frank Langella's acting knows that he can take any role and make it work. Even in a goofy fantasy film like this, his acting comes off as epic and strong.The only real reason anyone would have any beef with this movie is if they are die hard fans of the comic or cartoon, as this movie obviously took plenty of liberties with canon.That being said, if you can ignore that, it's a REALLY fun movie!

160,MrCosmosPhD,By the Power of Cash-In!,3,17 February 2018,"Firstly, I must admit to not seeing very much of He Man at all-just enough to know that the show is essentially an extended advertisement for an action figure line, and not much else beyond this. This is significant because it reveals one of the central problems this film has right from the starting gun: there is very little meat on the source material to begin with, and already so little of it can be transferred onto an hour and 45 minutes of cinema, leaving the movie as much of a barren wasteland as Eternia itself. Perhaps this explains the film's insistence on taking as much as it can from the Star Wars franchise-anything to add meat to bones, it seems. There is furthermore not much else of value that can save this film from its lack of substance. A disappointingly long stretch of runtime has the film on the planet we humans call home, with the potential of the Castle Greyskull set only utilized in the movie's beginning and end. The performances of most of our actors range from adequately bland (Courtney Cox) to unacceptably terrible (poor Billy Barty), with Dolph Lundgren in particular even more stiff than his hulking muscles appear to be. Should I mention he is the star?The movie is not so devoid of value to the viewer as I perhaps have said it be, however. Frank Langella's turn as the power-hungry Skellator, who seeks to obtain the universe's power, is delightfully show-stealing, cheesier than a Texas grilled. The set of the Castle Greyskull, being used far too briefly, are yet admittedly impressive and do actually have the feel of it being another planet far from ours. And much of the film's action, apart from some quick edits to mask Dolph's apparent poor swordsmanship, is adequately shot and pulls in enough investment. Despite this, Masters of the Universe does not convince this viewer that it holds much worth, seemingly being more contempt as a cliche-ridden, empty shell of its source material and of the Star Wars franchise. I would advise whomever may read this to instead search for clips of Frank Langella as Skellator instead-I promise you that it would be a better use of the finite time you and I have in this universe.",Masters of the Universe

The film is highly enjoyable in a campy way, and entertaining to watch. Mainly the film triumphs in it's set design and effects, Castle Grayskull being one of the high points. As we were to see afterward, with wasted projects like Lost in space key things that made the cartoon entertaining only appeared once if at all. He-Man's classic line ""I have the power!"" is only said once or twice, and there isn't battle cat (probably due to lack of funds) It is a shame that the film will probably never be re-released on video or appear on DVD, as it is one of my favorites.

If you're looking for an accurate live-action version of your beloved He-Man, don't watch Masters of the Universe.  If you're looking for a good sci-fi fantasy movie, don't watch Masters of the Universe.  If you're looking for awesome fight sequences, don't watch Masters of the Universe. But if you're looking for a goofy movie that you can enjoy and to which you can unwind, then Masters of the Universe is what you want.By no stretch of the imagination is this a good movie.  It has a trite plot, terrible acting, and special effects that were bad even for the 80s.  But the folks that made this movie knew they weren't making a Best Picture contender.  It's full of cheese, and like a pizza, that just makes it better.So for your next cheesy film fest, make sure to include Masters of the Universe.  It's perfect for a night of popcorn, pizza, drinks and friends. It probably deserves a 2 or 3, but gets a 4 because the movie does exactly what a movie like this is supposed to: entertain and make a few laughs.

Though not as good as Star Wars, it really isn't that bad of a movie.  Especially if you remember growing up watching He-man on TV and pretending that you could hold a magic sword above your head and become all powerful. Yes, some of the lines are cheap and the acting is stilted and questionable at times, but it is still a fun movie.  If you forget what I've just mentioned and just sit back and enjoy the fantasy and the adventure, and you will enjoy the movie.  Some memorable scenes are the battles in the junk yard, the flying hover craft fight and the final fight between He-man and Skelator.

Simply because it showed a total lack of respect for the source material. Masters of the Universe (they couldn't even give it the full title) wasn't set on Earth because the writer was trying to be clever and not give the audience exactly what they expected. It was done simply because they didn't have the budget to create Eternia, so instead of putting the idea to rest, they saw dollar signs and continued regardless.There are so many things about this film that annoy me as a childhood fan of the cartoon. An example being the fact that Skeletor isn't a skeleton-man, he's a man wearing a rubber mask that has an image of a skull on it. What were they thinking? It looks cheap and ultimately insulting.In short, avoid like the plague.

My memories of the film as a child are dim, unlike many of my contemporaries who fondly remember Masters of the Universe.  So I revisited and whilst now the effects are ropey, the dialogue a little limited and the plot very 80s, the cosmic key doubling as a ""cool"" synthesiser, it does have a certain nieve charm.Dolph is muscled up, baby oiled up and stoic.  He doesn't seem to have a lot to say which may not be such a bad thing. Langella is a delight and very much the focus of the movie playing the rather camp Skeletor with great gusto.  He delivers lines like 'on your knees proud warrior' and 'yes you will, yes you will or I shall wreak terrible harm upon you' (or words to that effect)with verve.  As He-man points out, he doesnt want the woman (the sorceress/hag) he wants his he-man and its always been between them.  And perhaps it always will? Make of that little nugget of information what you will.  I know my interpretation added depth and perhaps hidden dimensions to the struggle for power between skeletor and his bulky nemesis.The leprechaun, gwimmer, gwildor something gwimmy anyway, is interesting too, nice scene between him and the cow.Cast your cynicism and modern sensibilities aside, rest your weary brain and any thought processes, and enjoy this tale through the eyes of a child.

Just for the big finale when Skeletor finally gets his hands on Grayskull and the sword. It's just about the best maniacal villain speech in history, totally validating why I always rooted for Skeletor as a kid. Stuff He-Man, fascist poster-boy. Skeletor all the way.Wanna know why? (And here come the ""spoilers""...) Here's why: Skeletor finally gets the Power of Grayskull and becomes a shiny golden god of evil, gloating ever more epically while having literally spurting blasts of evil glee... until He-Man inevitably bursts his chains, beats the hell out of Skeletor's evil legion, seizes the sword and gives it the old ""I Have The Power!"" The surviving hordes of darkness flee the castle as He-Man and Skeletor finally set to, hammering each other with all the godlike fury we expect from guys dueling to be Master of the Universe. He-Man wins. Skeletor's godlike powers fall from him and he's left at He-Man's feet, all shrunken and puny as before. He-Man begins his own macho gloating speech about the power of Good etc, etc... but doesn't get two words into it, because Skeletor gets the hell up, sets on him again, and batters him stupid... for all of five seconds, before He-Man flings him into the obligatory chasm of fire.Point is, even without his godlike powers, Skeletor still gets up and had another go. This is like Lex Luthor getting up again after Superman's slapped him about. At the end of the long credits and classic 80s Fantasy music, Skeletor drags himself out of the pit of fire, still leery. That's... actually more heroic than anything He-Man ever did. Hence, I always wanted Skeletor to win. Come on, he deserves it.",Masters of the Universe

I was a huge fan of the cartoon and I had a few of the action figures. I can't remember the amount of times He-Man and Skeletor went head to head on my bedroom floor and in my back yard. Of course they were also teamed up with Optimus Prime and Megatron (but for some reason they always banded together to destroy my sisters doll house. lol, never mind). As a kid this movie was everything I wanted it to be . OK, I might have bin a bit disappointed that some of my favourite characters hadn't made the cut, but once I got into the movie I soon forgot all that, as I remember. When I was DVD shopping recently I came across it and got it for nostalgia sake. After not seeing it for a long time me and the family sat down to have a watch. Now my kids, being 6 and 9. Have never even heard of He-Man and my wife wasn't a huge fan as a kid. Now I will admit that, when watching it this time I wasn't as impressed as I was as a kid. I noticed a lot of the sort of impossibilities that annoy me even in a Si-Fi, fantasy film like this. For example, when He-Man and his group arrive at the music store before Evil-Lyn and her group. Even though Evil-Lyn left the same starting point first and was flying. (you might call it nit picking but that sort of stuff upsets me) But I realised that all that really didn't matter when noticed that both my kids were really into it. I remembered that it is a kids movie after all; and as such isn't bound by the same laws as movies targeted at a more mature audience. All things considered i think the storyline, plot and acting were all good enough, and all added up to exactly what the film was intended to be, a great family movie. I think Frank Langella gave a very good performance as skeletor. I never realised, and couldn't believe it was him under all that make-up. I watched 'Superman Returns' not long after that. In which he plays the newspaper editor. Watching the two performances back to back is really quite daunting.",Masters of the Universe

The story starts on there home planet of Eternia but ends up on earth due to the cosmic key which a local inventor designed to transport anywhere in the universe, but was stolen and used to get into Castle Greyskull and capture the guardian the sorceress this is where the battle begins. After recapturing the cosmic key Gweldor ended up having to open a portal door to escape Skeletor and his warriors. They ended up on earth but lost the key so they set out to finding the key. But Skeletor used a second key to follow. Two earthlings found the key and this is how Skeletor located the planet. They find the key had been taken to a music shop this is where the first battle on earth was. Evelyn disguised as the mother of the earthling steals the key back. Then He-man is captured to save the rest. The rest end up using the damaged key with a keyboard to get the required notes to get back home.

No one will ever realize what goes into making any movie, but we had many masters to please on this one.  The entire movie was done for $17,000,000 and it's a good looking film. I'm proud of the film, and pleased to say it was the feature film debut of Courtney Cox, Robert Duncan McNeil(""Voyager"") and Chelsea Field (""Last Boy Scout""). I recommend the film highly, but as the director, I am a bit prejudiced.  I saw it again recently and enjoyed it.  I hope any of you who view it enjoy it as well, but remember, it IS HE-MAN, so you shouldn't expect Lawrence of Arabia.

179,ninjali,Action-Comedy,7,14 September 2002,"Alright, this movie has some years on it's neck but it still is good. Maybe not as exiting and cool as when I was younger but nowaydays there is more of a real cool comedy veil over it. Damn I laugh when I see Dolph running around in underware and a Cape gainig trust from scared earthpeople. Sadly i's getting harder and harder to get a copy of, but anyway. A ""cool"" movie.",Masters of the Universe
180,Double_R,Once an all-time favourite...,6,3 January 2003,"Back in the period between 1987-1990, when I was a mere 6-9 year old, I used to absolutely love this film.  I saw it in the cinema, and constantly rented it out from the video shop.  It's fair to say it was my favourite film of all time at one point.12 years later, I realised it had been released on DVD, and decided it was time to make a purchase.  Sadly, my memories of such a fantastic film have been clouded by terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and a rather weak storyline.Gwildor is the Jar Jar Binks of the mid-eighties, while Dolph Lundgren appears to be struggling with the concept and execution of the English language.  On the plus side though, you do get to see a youthful Courtney Cox, years before the idea of marrying a wrestling policeman that struggles with giant spiders ever entered into her head.",Masters of the Universe
181,jippa18,Masters of the 80's,9,2 November 2010,"Of all the Star Wars rip-offs, the only worth while watch would have to be the masterful MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE.Set in the land of Eternia, He-Man (played by Dolph Lundgren) and friends find themselves in a bit of a pickle when Skeletor and his cronies crash the party and make heads roll. Skeletor captures the Sorceress, takes over the Castle of Greyskull, and tries to enslave He-Man. Basically, he wants to make peoples' lives a living hell.There are many parts of this movie that bear similarities to Star Wars. Storm Trooper look alike, laser beams that deflect off of swords, a cloaked bad guy who can shoot lightning from his body, bounty hunters, the struggle between futuristic good and evil...the list goes on and on. However, once you get past the fact that this movie directly steals from Star Wars, you start to appreciate the awesomeness that this film brings to the table. Let me review a couple scenes for you.After transporting to earth, the good guys in this movie find themselves conveniently located near one of the most delicious fast food places ever found in a film, Robby's Chicken Shack. Of course, the wily veteran of the group, Man-at-Arms, follows his nose toward the tempting fried chicken and ribs. However, Gwildor, a troll look alike, beats him to the punch and goes fly-fishing for some freshly fried buckets of food out of a nearby convertible. Upon learning that they are indeed eating meat from an animal, the female warrior Teela condemns the two hunger-stricken heroes for being so inhumane. Shut up, bitch... and go make me a space burger. Man, this scene always makes me hungry.Meanwhile, Skeletor is freaking out because no one has died at his hands yet.... (continued at www.oldforgereviews.blogspot.com )",Masters of the Universe
182,johnp800-957-393185,Poor is not the word.,1,10 August 2018,"Now we all know Dolph Lundgren is not best know for being in many box office hit movies, Rocky four not included that is. However I think its more then safe to say Masters of the universe has to be one of them. A poor budget movie with poor effects, acting, storyline & just about everything else. In one word the only word I can find to describe this movie is poor!",Masters of the Universe
183,Kvmullett-132-801251,Classic,8,1 March 2020,"A classic 80's film, tons of cheese and good heart. I love this film and will watch it every time it is on! I love the way the represent all the classic figures from the original cartoon and the toys",Masters of the Universe
184,judsonword,80 heavenly gobbledygook that is male goodness,8,13 July 2019,It is dated and had not too much to do with Herman and the masters of the universe but damn was it a good try. Loved this to this day. Great for the time. And frank Lamgella IS Skellator!!,Masters of the Universe
185,Tballer3413,"Well presented take on the cartoon series, and entertaining storyline for those without the background",7,20 June 2005,"Masters of the Universe is not by any means an excellent film or movie, but it is a great roller coaster ride through the fantasy frontier that leaves viewers satisfied and impressed with the depiction of Skeletor in particular, regardless of the sketchy mask. Epic fight sequences and plot twists with side characters help shake down the unbelievability of the idea that Dolph Lundgren, or Ivan Drago from Rocky IV whichever you prefer, has put down his boxing gloves and replaced them with the sword of Grey Skull. Yes he's very skittish throughout the entire movie and he lacks the charisma you would actually expect out of He-Man, but when the moment of truth is upon him he is right when he says, ""I HAVE THE POWER!""",Masters of the Universe
186,calypso17,Gotta Love It,9,11 June 2014,"Lighthearted with enough action to keep one content enough. Frank Langela does a terrific performance as Skeletor, the subtle touches he adds to the character stays true to the animated series and out of all the cast he really does steal the show. He-Man could have been played by no other than Dolph Lundgren he fit the description of He-Man to T. The story may be somewhat weak at certain points, but the character development is very good you have to pay close enough attention to catch it. Beastman and Evilyn are the only villains from the animated series besides Skeletor, while Beastman's part is small his character does come through subtlety at points. Meg Foster did well with Evilyns character so beautifully evil. Though I do wish they would have gone with the sorceress's original look my only complaint.You get a little more insight from the commentary as well The schedule was very tight, and all the cast to-date agrees making the film was hard work for all of them, so at least appreciate the time they put in it, it wasn't easy. For people who complain about it being different from the animated series,look at it this way it could have been a lot worse. For most people the story will probably be hit and miss but overall, Gwildors lines and Skeletors mixed in with Saroud, You just gotta love it.",Masters of the Universe
187,pinkchampagne1,Rating,9,10 June 2014,"I enjoyed the film, and I am one who does like the cartoon series, from the 80s version to the 2000 version. This film is not really like the animated series, a lot of people complain about that, but if it had stayed true to it, it would probably have been a lot more campier when you think about it, it was a show made for kids. Its another version of He-Man where there is no alter identity his background was supposed to be a prince turned warrior, I think thats fine of course I do wish they would have had Cringer in it and Orco, I still like the movie. I think Skeltors character stayed true to the animated series, that sort of evilness mixed with a mockness of He-mans nobility. My personal rating would be a 4 and a half out of 5 stars, and my critical rating acknowledging the plot holes would be a 3 star out of 5.",Masters of the Universe
188,wavelindsay-1,More than life,8,18 July 2005,"Okay, let's face it. We all have our own opinions on films. Some say the Godfather is one of the best films made. Personally i could name 10 films that easily beat it (Masters of the Universe isn't one of them by the way) but there are much better films out there. But despite our professionalism when it comes to rating films, there's always a special place in our hearts for those really cheesy childhood movies that made on hell of a difference to our upbringing one way or another. Masters of the Universe is one of those films. Frank Langella, Skeletor, plays the part of He-Man's nemesis better than anyone else i could dream of. Dolph was perfect for the part of He-man. Sure there were some good old fashioned bad guys missing. And where was battlecat? I'll tell you where, at the bottom of the budget. At least we had Air Centurions and a damn sexy Evil Lynn. But above all, we had some bad ass lines in there. I think they done well with what they had. Even the tune is good (thanks for Rocky too Bill). If you don't like this movie it's cause you've got no soul. Masters of the Universe is a masterpiece in every way, shape and form. There hasn't been a bad guy like Skeletor (with the exclusion of Darth Vader) who was able to do the role justice. You probably grew up on a steady diet of westerns (that didn't include Clint Eastwood) and therefor have no imagination. If you don't like Masters of the universe then there's a good chance you don't like other classics like Big Trouble in Little China and other such masterpieces. In which case go back to watching so called classics and pick out another sweater from bland wardrobe and rot.Look for more down to earth reviews coming soon (big Trouble in Little china, Rocky, Predator, etc)",Masters of the Universe
189,rprinkey,A Fun 1980's Action Film that Forgets its source material!!!,8,9 March 2007,"As a kid in the 1980's, I was not into the Fantasy scene. I would have taken Star Wars and Star Trek over Conan the Barbarian any day. That is why I was reluctant to rent ""Masters of the Universe"" way back when it was first released on Home Video. Fortunately I let my buddy pick our rental for the day and we watched ""Masters"".Yeah, this film isn't going to win any awards, but it really is fun to watch. At the time, the effects were not bad and Dolph really looked the part of He-Man.It is interesting to note, however, that this film really does not stay true to its cartoon origins. For instance, the cartoon dealt with the battles of good vs. evil in a mystical fantasy-land 'Eternia', i.e. 'Third Earth' or 'Middle Earth' . . . But this film placed Eternia in a science fiction setting. There really is no reason for He-Man to use a sword when he is shooting his laser gun. Further, the film used mostly new creatures instead of the beloved characters created for the toy line. It's kind of like the producers of this film decided to take He-Man and put a Star Wars-like spin on it. What emerges from the mixer, then, is a sci-fi action film that doesn't take itself too seriously.",Masters of the Universe
